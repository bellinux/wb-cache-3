5000|$|A <b>microwave</b> <b>spectrometer</b> can be most simply {{constructed}} using {{a source}} of microwave radiation, an absorption cell into which sample gas can be introduced and a detector such as a superheterodyne receiver. A spectrum {{can be obtained by}} sweeping the frequency of the source while detecting the intensity of transmitted radiation. A simple section of waveguide can serve as an absorption cell. An important variation of the technique in which an alternating current is applied across electrodes within the absorption cell results in a modulation of the frequencies of rotational transitions. This is referred to as Stark modulation and allows the use of phase-sensitive detection methods offering improved sensitivity. Absorption spectroscopy allows the study of samples that are thermodynamically stable at room temperature. The first study of the microwave spectrum of a molecule (...) was performed by Cleeton & Williams in 1934. Subsequent experiments exploited powerful sources of microwaves such as the klystron, many of which were developed for radar during the Second World War. The number of experiments in microwave spectroscopy surged immediately after the war. By 1948, Walter Gordy was able to prepare a review of the results contained in approximately 100 research papers. Commercial versions [...] of microwave absorption spectrometer were developed by Hewlett Packard in the 1970s and were once widely used for fundamental research. Most research laboratories now exploit either Balle-Flygare or chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave (FTMW) spectrometers.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the accuracy of}} atmospheric vertical temperature profile measurements performed by the Nimbus 5 <b>microwave</b> <b>spectrometer</b> and compares results obtained during the first 6 months of its operation with independent ground-truth measurements (coincident radiosonde measurements). The <b>microwave</b> <b>spectrometer</b> can measure temperature profiles averaged over the instrument weighting function (about 10 km) layers with a root-mean-square accuracy of a few tenths of a degree K for measurement integration times of 16 s.

40|$|Global maps of {{temperature}} profiles 0 - 20 km and of total water vapor and liquid water over ocean {{have been obtained}} from satellite-borne <b>microwave</b> <b>spectrometers.</b> Future satellites should extend the altitude range above 100 km and permit monitoring of H 2 O, O 3, CO, N 2 O, and other trace constituents. Operational <b>microwave</b> temperature-sounding <b>spectrometers</b> are scheduled for launch on both military and civilian U. S. satellites, and future improvements can be expected...|$|R
40|$|As {{the human}} {{emission}} {{of greenhouse gases}} continue to increase, the atmosphere is changing. The mesosphere region is particularly interesting as the magnitude of temperature change in this region {{is expected to be}} larger, than in the lower layers of the atmosphere. However, there is still much uncertainty related to the long-term effects of these changes. It is therefore important to have instruments that can provide long-term monitoring of the dynamics and chemistry of the middle atmosphere. Species with long photochemical lifetime can be used to study the dynamics of the mesosphere. At the Onsala Space Observatory two such species, CO and H 2 O, have been measured {{over a number of years}} with <b>microwave</b> <b>spectrometers.</b> These instruments can provide us with continuous measurements of the mesosphere over long time periods. This thesis concerns characterising and improving the measurements and retrievals from the two <b>microwave</b> <b>spectrometers.</b> This thesis puts forth a possible improvement in the inversion algorithm used for retrieving time-series from ground-based <b>microwave</b> <b>spectrometers.</b> By using a two dimensional retrieval method, the inversions can take into account the temporal correlation of the atmospheric state. The new method was tested on the 22 GHz spec- trometer measuring mesospheric water vapour at OSO. The result is a more flexible retrieval that removes the problem of ad-hoc selecting data averaging times before performing an inversion. An additional improvement offered by the new method is the ability to consistently interpolate the retrieved data in order to close measurement gaps or re-grid the data. The thesis also compares a six year long time series of mesospheric CO from the 115 GHz spectrometer at OSO to measurements from contemporary satellite instruments. The systematic errors of the instrument are estimated to ± 40 % from 2002 - 2004 and ± 20 % from 2004 - 2008. Compared to the satellite measurements, the measurements from the OSO radiometer have a mean difference of less than or equal to 25 %. This is consistent with the combined systematic errors of both the ground-based and satellite instruments. The thorough error characterisation, and the improved retrieval method, presented in this thesis ensure that the data produced by the <b>microwave</b> <b>spectrometers</b> at OSO remain relevant and important for the future study of the middle atmosphere...|$|R

40|$|Present {{and future}} {{satellite}} atmospheric sounding is discussed. Although present systems sound principally the temperature profile {{and the water}} vapor and precipitation abundances over ocean, future systems will measure other constituents such as O 3, H 2 O 2, and ClO, and will provide improved spatial resolution, retrieval accuracy, and altitude coverage for temperature and humidity. Present systems {{with only a few}} channels will be replaced by systems with 20 or more, and larger antennas with more sensitive radiometers will permit horizontal resolutions of 15 to 50 km or less, even from geosynchronous orbit. The success of imaging <b>microwave</b> <b>spectrometers</b> in penetrating clouds and in yielding uniquely accurate measurements ensure a growing role in operational and research systems for these remote sensing techniques...|$|R

Dimethyl carbonate [(CH_ 3) _(2) CO_ 3] is one of the lower energy species in this family, which includes the C_ 3 -sugars 1, 3 -dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde. The microwave spectrum of dimethyl carbonate has been measured over the frequency range 8. 4 – 25. 3 GHz with several pulsed-beam Fourier-transform <b>microwave</b> <b>spectrometers</b> and from 227 GHz to 350 GHz with direct absorption spectrometers.

An average 45 m rms discrepancy is {{found for the}} 100 - 50 kPa layer, and several sources of this discrepancy are quantified in the following way. Correlation coefficients between pairs of spectrometer observations and between pairs of radiosonde observations are each extrapolated to zero separation distance to provide measures of instrument noise. <b>Microwave</b> <b>spectrometer</b> noise {{is found to be}} 16 m rms and radiosonde noise 23 m rms. Estimates are also made of those portions of the total discrepancy which are due to different resolution of the sensors (about 15 m rms) and real spatial and temporal variation of the atmosphere between observations (about 17 m rms) ...|$|E

40|$|Microwave {{sounders}} are multichannel microwave radiometers {{for measuring}} atmospheric temperature (or humidity) profiles. These devices are {{also known as}} <b>microwave</b> <b>spectrometers</b> because a sounder typically {{has a number of}} channels measuring the spectral shape of an absorption line. Each channel of the sounder responds essentially to a given layer of the atmosphere. The characteristics of currently employed microwave sounders on satellites are briefly examined, and new features expected in connection with the introduction of the next generation sounders are discussed. There will probably be {{an increase in the number}} of oxygen channels with the objective to extend the weighting function height coverage into the stratosphere and to improve the temperature retrieval accuracy. Other features are to be related to better surface resolution, auxiliary channels, and water vapor sounding...|$|R
40|$|New astronomical and remote-sensing {{instruments}} require <b>microwave</b> <b>spectrometers</b> {{with modest}} spectral res-olution over many gigahertz of instantaneous bandwidth. Applications include millimeter-wave searches for distant objects with poorly known redshifts, submillimeter and far-infrared observations of Doppler-broadened spectral lines from galaxies, and observations of pressure-broadened atmospheric lines. Wide bandwidths {{and the consequent}} stability requirements make it di±cult to use general-purpose re-ceiver and spectrometer architectures in these applications. We discuss analog auto- and cross-correlation lag spectrometers that are optimized for these observations. Analog correlators obtain their wide bandwidths {{by a combination of}} transmission line delays and direct voltage multiplication in transistor or diode mixers. We show results from a new custom transistor multiplier with bandwidth to 25 GHz. Stability becomes increasingly im-portant as bandwidths broaden. We discuss system requirements for single-dish correlation radiometers, which have intrinsic high stability, and present results showing that analog cross-correlators are suitable backends for these receivers...|$|R

40|$|<b>Microwave</b> <b>spectrometers</b> have unique {{advantages}} {{in the ability}} to determine high resolution features that are specific to a given chemical. Very sharp lines which correspond to quantum states of the chemical allow for unique identification of the chemical. Recent advances have shown the possibility of room temperature microwave spectroscopy analysis in which the data is collected in {{a short amount of time}} using broadband chirp pulse Fourier transform microwave (CP-FTMW) spectroscopy. In this report, we explore the design of reduced size spectrometers focusing on the reduction as well as expansion of operation frequency of the microwave analysis cell, where the chemical is analyzed at room temperature. In addition, a new real-time digitizer is used in our system to replace the digital storage oscilloscope and can achieve 1 million coherent averages in 20 seconds. Signal-to-noise ratio can be greatly improved, and we take the advantage of the increased SNR and explore chemical signal strength with low input power, and we also demonstrated simultaneous transmit and receive by implementing an absorptive bandstop filter to the system.

40|$|In this dissertation, {{techniques}} of high-resolution rotational spectroscopy {{have been used}} to measure the spectra of molecules in both laboratory and astronomical settings. In the laboratory, small metal-bearing molecules containing zinc, iron, nickel, titanium, yttrium, and scandium have been studied at microwave and millimeter/submillimeter wavelengths in order to determine their rotational, fine, and hyperfine constants. These molecules were synthesized in situ in direct-absorption and Fourier-transform <b>microwave</b> <b>spectrometers</b> using Broida-type ovens and laser ablation methods. From the spectroscopic parameters, information about fundamental physical propertes and electronic character could be obtained. Radio telescopes were used to measure the spectra of molecules in different interstellar environments. A new molecule, FeCN, was detected toward the circumstellar envelope of the carbon-rich asymtotic giant branch star, IRC+ 10216, marking the first iron-bearing molecule detected in the interstellar medium. The telescopes were also used to conduct a study of the evolved planetary nebula, NGC 7293, or the Helix Nebula. In the Helix, CO, HCO⁺, and H₂CO were observed at several positions offset from the central star to obtain densities and kinetic temperatures throughout the Helix. A map of the HCO⁺ J = 1 → 0 transition was also constructed, showing that HCO⁺ is widespread throughout the Helix, instead of being photodissociated and destroyed, as theoretical models of planetary nebulae predict...|$|R

40|$|The {{rotational}} {{spectrum of}} the higher-energy trans conformational isomer of methyl formate has been assigned {{for the first time}} using several pulsed-jet Fourier transform <b>microwave</b> <b>spectrometers</b> in the 6 - 60 GHz frequency range. This species has also been sought toward the Sagittarius B 2 (N) molecular cloud using the publicly available PRIMOS survey from the Green Bank Telescope. We detect seven absorption features in the survey that coincide with laboratory transitions of trans-methyl formate, from which we derive a column density of 3. 1 (+ 2. 6, - 1. 2) × 10 ^ 13 cm- 2 and a rotational temperature of 7. 6 ± 1. 5 K. This excitation temperature is significantly lower than that of the more stable cis conformer in the same source but is consistent with that of other complex molecular species recently detected in Sgr B 2 (N). The difference in the rotational temperatures of the two conformers suggests that they have different spatial distributions in this source. As the abundance of trans-methyl formate is far higher than would be expected if the cis and trans conformers are in thermodynamic equilibrium, processes that could preferentially form trans-methyl formate in this region are discussed. We also discuss measurements that could be performed to make this detection more certain. This manuscript demonstrates how publicly available broadband radio astronomical surveys of chemically rich molecular clouds can be used in conjunction with laboratory rotational spectroscopy to search for new molecules in the interstellar medium.
