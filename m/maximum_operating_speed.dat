5|$|The {{last eight}} trains were ordered in 2002 and {{delivered}} in 2004–2006, finalising the fleet of 18 trains. At that point {{it had become}} clear that the speed limits on the rail network were mostly too low for the trains to run at their <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>speed,</b> {{even though they were}} chosen specifically to prevent the costly work of straightening existing lines. Work on lines has continued, and, on modernised lines, the speed difference between the Pendolino and non-tilting trains has become minimal. The Sm3 was able to attain its <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>speed</b> in regular traffic only in 2006, when a new rail line was opened between Kerava and Lahti and the full Pendolino fleet was available. Seven of the original 23 options never came to be.|$|E

30|$|Different {{standards}} {{apply to}} at-grade crossings of LRT. LRT {{has at least}} five different categories of operational alignments {{all of which have}} criteria for the type of warning systems needed at intersections based on the <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>speeds.</b> Usually at speeds under 35 mph, LRTs use the existing street traffic signal controls in conjunction with priority and preemption controls [23].

25|$|Maximum {{allowable}} speed: The <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>speed</b> for the compressor.

3000|$|The <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>speeds</b> of HS {{trains are}} usually about 250 – 350  km/h. The {{deceleration}} 3 rate a − varies, i.e., it generally increases with the decrease of speed during the breaking phase of trip. The buffer zone (typically {{of the length}} of S [...] b/j  =  100  m) is the distance added to the braking distance of trailing HS train to allow a margin for its safe separation from the leading train (i) [22, 23]. The train length is typically L =  200 or 400  m. The latter is the length of Eurostar and 2 -unit German-designed Velaro train operating in China (Table  3).|$|R
50|$|There may be {{restriction}} in <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>speeds</b> due {{to track}} geometry of existing line, especially on curves. Straightening the route, where possible, {{will reduce the}} travel time by increasing the allowable speeds and by reducing the length of track. When straight routes are not possible, {{reducing the number of}} curves and lowering the degree of curvature would result in higher allowable speeds on those curves. An example is the elimination of three consecutive reverse curves in favor of one larger curve. Raising superelevation may be considered for sharp curves which significantly limit speed. The higher speeds on those modified curves, together with the higher superelevation, will require track modification to have transition spirals to and from those curves to be longer.|$|R
30|$|The type of {{signaling}} system influences {{the length of}} a block of the track, which can be occupied exclusively by a single HS train. The number of such successive empty blocks determining the (breaking) distance between any pair of HS trains moving in the same direction depends of their <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> cruising <b>speed</b> and the breaking/deceleration rate(s).|$|R

CRH3C and CRH2C designs have an MOR of 300km/h, and can reach up to 350km/h, with a top testing speed more than 380km/h.

500|$|In 1957, a Vulcan B.1 XA892 {{attached}} to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A) at Boscombe Down for acceptance testing was unintentionally flown to an Indicated Mach Number (IMN) above 1.04, alarming the crew that it had reached supersonic speed. XA892s commander, Flt Lt Milt Cottee (RAAF), and co-pilot, Flt Lt Ray Bray (RAF), were tasked to fly at [...] and 0.98 IMN, taking the aircraft to a load factor of 3g. It climbed to [...] and then dived, intending to reach the target speed at [...] Approaching the target altitude, the throttles were closed and full up-elevator applied, but XA892 continued to pitch nose-down. Cottee contemplated pushing forward to go inverted and then rolling upright; instead, he opened the speed brakes. Although the airspeed was above their <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>speed,</b> the speed brakes were undamaged and did slow the aircraft, which came back past the vertical at about [...] and leveled off at [...] There were no reports of a sonic boom, it is unlikely a true Mach Number of 1.0 was reached. Afterwards, a rear bulkhead {{was found to be}} deformed.|$|E
50|$|Aircraft have {{a flight}} {{envelope}} that describes its safe performance limits {{in regard to}} such things as minimum and <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>speeds,</b> and its <b>operating</b> structural strength. Flight envelope protection calculates that flight envelope (and adds a margin of safety) and uses this information to stop pilots from making control inputs that would put the aircraft outside that flight envelope. For example, if the pilot uses the rearward side-stick to pitch the aircraft nose up, the control computers creating the flight envelope protection will prevent the pilot pitching the aircraft beyond the stalling angle of attack. As a result, even if the pilot tried to apply more and more rearward control, the flight envelope protection would cause the aircraft to ignore this command. Flight envelope protection can in this way increase aircraft safety by allowing the pilot to apply in an emergency maximum control forces while not {{at the same time}} inadvertently putting the aircraft outside the margins of its operational safety.|$|R

On 2009 data, if HSR had been operational between Sydney and Melbourne, between Sydney and Brisbane, and between Sydney and intermediate points on each corridor, and attracting at least 50 per cent of aviation passenger numbers, then 198 slots would have been released at Sydney Airport. Areas for further research in an Australian context include liquid fuel savings from diversion from cars and buses to HSR on shorter corridors, the potential reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, and external costs...|$|R

40|$|A variable-speed {{power turbine}} concept is {{analyzed}} for rotordynamic feasibility in a Large Civil Tilt-Rotor (LCTR) class engine.
