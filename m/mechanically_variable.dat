5000|$|In 1965, {{the first}} known {{experiments}} with variable speed limit signs took place on a 30 km stretch of German motorway A8 between Munich and the border city of Salzburg, Austria. <b>Mechanically</b> <b>variable</b> message signs could display speeds of 60, 80 and 100 km/h, [...] "danger zone" [...] or [...] "accident". Personnel monitored traffic using video technology, and manually controlled the signage. [...] Beginning in the 1970s, additional advanced traffic control systems were put into service. Modern motorway control systems can work without human intervention using various types of sensors to measure traffic flow and weather conditions. In 2009, 1300 km of German motorways were equipped with such systems.|$|E

Low cost variable capacitors squeeze together alternating layers of aluminum and plastic with a screw. Electrical control of capacitance is achievable with varactors (or varicaps), which are reverse-biased semiconductor diodes whose depletion region width varies with applied voltage. They are used in phase-locked loops, amongst other applications.|$|R
50|$|Since H is a <b>mechanically</b> defined <b>{{variable}}</b> {{that is not}} conserved, then {{like any}} other such variable (pressure, etc.) it will show thermal fluctuations. This means that H regularly shows spontaneous increases from the minimum value. Technically {{this is not an}} exception to the H theorem, since the H theorem was only intended to apply for a gas with {{a very large number of}} particles. These fluctuations are only perceptible when the system is small and the time interval over which it is observed is not enormously large.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive analysis of voltage step-up converters for energy harvesting and other low-power applications. The step-up operation {{is based on}} isolating the charge of a <b>mechanically</b> <b>variable</b> capacitor and varying {{the gap between the}} electrodes by an appropriate method of providing an actuation force i. e. electrostatic or physical. Two devices are presented; a bi-stable device and a resonant device, specifically designed for solar and vibration energy harvesting respectively. The bi-stable device introduces a separate electrostatic actuator element to manipulate the variable capacitor electrodes, whereas, {{in the case of the}} resonant device, ambient vibrations provide the necessary actuation force. System-level Multisim models have been developed and verified using 3 D FEM Coventorware and MEMS+ simulations. The devices were then fabricated using a dicing-free Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) process developed at the Southampton Nanofabrication Centre. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the design and}} functionality of an RF directional coupler for which the power division between the output ports is <b>mechanically</b> <b>variable.</b> In an alternate power distribution scheme for the ILC, power is delivered to cavities in pairs, through hybrids. Four pairs, or eight cavities, are fed from one waveguide feed, from which one fourth, one third, and {{one half of the}} power is coupled out at consecutive directional couplers. Three such feeds are powered by a single 10 MW klystron. Experience suggests that cavities considered useable will display some variation in the operational accelerating gradient they can sustain. With fixed distribution, the klystron power must be kept below the level at which the weakest cavity out of 24 receives its power limit. This problem can be solved by installing variable attenuators, but that means wasting precious power. With adjustable coupling, distribution can be optimized for more efficient use both of available power and of the accelerating cavities. This novel device, feeding cavities paired by similar performance, can provide such benefit to the ILC...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Owing {{to their}} low carbon dioxide {{emissions}} and fuel consumptions, diesel engines have gained a significant market share of passenger cars in Europe. However, gasoline engines are exclusively used to power passenger cars in the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China and many other countries. The introduction of diesel engines to the passenger car market in many countries is unlikely {{to take place in}} the near future because of the limited diesel fuel supply, higher cost of diesel cars, and public perception of diesel vehicles. Therefore, development of high-efficiency gasoline engines is of particular importance. As part of a State Key Project of the National Basic Research Program (the 973 Program), the present authors have carried out systematic research and development of a high-efficiency gasoline engine. The engine was equipped in production with devices for <b>mechanically</b> <b>variable</b> valve lift and timing and was operated with controlled autoignition (CAI) (homogeneous charge compression ignition) combustion under part-load conditions and spark-assisted combustion between the transitional region of CAI and the normal spark ignition (SI) combustion. This paper will describe the use of devices for variable valve lift and timing in a single-cylinder engine and their control. The engine performance and emission results in the CAI operational region are presented. The ability of the engine to achieve rapid and smooth transition between CAI and SI will be illustrated. A brief discussion of the implication of the results on the calculated driving-cycle fuel consumption will be given at the end. Finally, the plan for future development of a multi-cylinder engine of variable valve actuation will be given...|$|E
50|$|A {{variable}} capacitor is a capacitor whose capacitance may be intentionally and repeatedly changed <b>mechanically</b> or electronically. <b>Variable</b> capacitors {{are often used}} in L/C circuits to set the resonance frequency, e.g. to tune a radio (therefore it is sometimes called a tuning capacitor or tuning condenser), or as a variable reactance, e.g. for impedance matching in antenna tuners.|$|R
50|$|Older models {{would realize}} manual tuning {{by means of}} <b>mechanically</b> {{operated}} ganged <b>variable</b> capacitors. Often several sections would be provided on a tuning capacitor, to tune several stages of the receiver in tandem, or to allow switching between different frequency bands. A later method used a potentiometer supplying a variable voltage to varactor diodes in the local oscillator and tank circuits of front end tuner, for electronic tuning.|$|R
40|$|Throttling {{loss of a}} {{hydraulic}} system is {{a major contributor to}} the low system efficiency. Hydraulic transformers can poten-tially be used as an energy efficient, throttle-less control approach for multi-actuators systems powered by a common pressure rail (CPR). The transformer transforms the input CPR pressure to the desired pressure of the actuator instead of throttling it. Re-generative energy can also be captured. This paper presents a trajectory tracking controller for {{a hydraulic}} actuator driven by a transformer consisting of two <b>mechanically</b> coupled <b>variable</b> dis-placement pump/motors. In addition to controlling the motion of the actuator, the transformer speed is also controlled. The control method can be adapted for all 3 hydraulic transformer configu-rations that differ by port connections. Simulation results show the validity of the proposed control strategy and that transformer with an appropriate control strategy can significantly reduce en-ergy use relative to throttling valve. It is also shown that op-timizing transformer configuration for bucking or boosting, and optimizing the transformer speed can further improve efficiency. ...|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{devices that}} exploit {{electrical}} switching of physical properties of thin films of perovskite materials (especially colossal magnetoresistive materials) have been invented. Unlike some related prior devices, these devices function {{at room temperature}} and do not depend on externally applied magnetic fields. Devices of this type can be designed to function as sensors (exhibiting varying electrical resistance in response to varying temperature, magnetic field, electric field, and/or mechanical pressure) and as elements of electronic memories. The underlying principle is that the application {{of one or more}} short electrical pulse(s) can induce a reversible, irreversible, or partly reversible change in the electrical, thermal, mechanical, and magnetic properties of a thin perovskite film. The energy in the pulse must be large enough to induce the desired change but not so large as to destroy the film. Depending on the requirements of a specific application, the pulse(s) can have any of a large variety of waveforms (e. g., square, triangular, or sine) and be of positive, negative, or alternating polarity. In some applications, it could be necessary to use multiple pulses to induce successive incremental physical changes. In one class of applications, electrical pulses of suitable shapes, sizes, and polarities are applied to vary the detection sensitivities of sensors. Another class of applications arises in electronic circuits in which certain resistance values are required to be variable: Incorporating the affected resistors into devices of the present type makes it possible to control their resistances electrically over wide ranges, and the lifetimes of electrically variable resistors exceed those of conventional <b>mechanically</b> <b>variable</b> resistors. Another and potentially the most important class of applications is that of resistance-based nonvolatile-memory devices, such as a resistance random access memory (RRAM) described in the immediately following article, Electrically Variable Resistive Memory Devices (MFS- 32511 - 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{harvesting}} {{systems are}} becoming an increasingly popular area for research as they present {{themselves as a}} clean, renewable source of energy. There are currently some key design issues facing {{the development of these}} energy harvesting systems. In particular, these harvesters often produce relatively low voltages compared to the requirements of the intended application. For example, scientific apparatus aboard orbital satellites require relatively high voltage levels for operation (kV) but are powered from solar panels providing substantially lower output voltages (24 V). In contrast, for low power energy harvesting, such as micro scale vibration energy harvesters, a harvested voltage level of ? 0. 5 V is often required to power a low power sensor circuit which requires 2 - 5 V. Voltage multiplication is commonly achieved using charge pump multiplier circuits. However, these circuits are quite limited in both the range of multiplication (per unit area) and the maximum voltage level. This work aims {{to take advantage of a}} noticeable gap in the research field and is specifically targeted towards energy harvesting application areas. This thesis presents a comprehensive analysis of novel bi-stable and resonant MEMS voltage step-up converters. The operation is based on isolating the charge of a <b>mechanically</b> <b>variable</b> capacitor and varying the gap between the electrodes by an appropriate method of actuation force. As the electrode gap varies, so does the voltage level across the electrodes. In the case of the bi-stable devices, electrostatic actuation is employed while the resonant devices rely on ambient vibration force. These have been specifically designed for integration with static and vibration energy harvesters respectively. Prototype devices were fabricated using a dicing-free Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) process developed at the Southampton Nanofabrication Centre. For the bi-stable device, a maximum output voltage of 35. 7 V was measured, using a 100 M? load resistance, from a 24 V input voltage. Further improvements in the design of the MEMS variable capacitor can be made in order to increase the capacitance level of the devices while reducing the parasitic fringing capacitance. Optimisation of the MEMS device would enable the output to reach a level near the theoretical maximum limit set at 120 V...|$|E
5000|$|Quantum <b>mechanically,</b> the <b>variables</b> {{of a field}} (such as the field's {{amplitude}} at a given point) {{are represented}} by operators on a Hilbert space. In general, all observables are constructed as operators on the Hilbert space, and the time-evolution of the operators is governed by the Hamiltonian, which must be a positive operator. A state [...] annihilated by the Hamiltonian must be identified as the vacuum state, which {{is the basis for}} building all other states. In a non-interacting (free) field theory, the vacuum is normally identified as a state containing zero particles. In a theory with interacting particles, identifying the vacuum is more subtle, due to vacuum polarization, which implies that the physical vacuum in quantum field theory is never really empty. For further elaboration, see the articles on the quantum mechanical vacuum and the vacuum of quantum chromodynamics. The details of the canonical quantization depend on the field being quantized, and whether it is free or interacting.|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{mechanical}} control is being replaced with electrical control {{in order to}} have more freedom on the system response. In an internal combustion engine, on each cylinder are valves mounted to let air enter the cylinder and exhaust out. This valve is still controlled <b>mechanically.</b> Electrical <b>variable</b> valve actuation aims to electrically control the closing and opening of the valve. The most important is fast system response and no overshoot. For this reason {{it is important to know}} the profile of the load and be able to predict it. The application at hand is electronically controlling the opening and closing of fuel and exhaust valves. One method to solve this problem is by using a model of the plant and planning the motion offline. However, since this method is heavily model based, it is important first to have a good model of the plant, and second to have either a good model of the load, or to be able to estimate the load disturbance as good as possible. The aim of this project is to study the load behavior of fuel and exhaust valves, and then build a model that can simulate the load. After that the model should be used in an estimator manner that can be used real time while the system is running and should estimate the real load as close as possible.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{computational}} fluid dynamics (CFD) predictions of mixing time of a pollutant in an unventilated, mechanically mixed, isothermal room. The study aims to determine: (1) {{the adequacy of the}} standard Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes two-equation ({kappa}-{var_epsilon}) turbulence model for predicting the mixing time under these conditions and (2) {{the extent to which the}} mixing time depends on the room airflow, rather than the source location within the room. The CFD simulations modeled the 12 mixing time experiments performed by Drescher et al. (Indoor Air 5 (1995) 204) using a point pulse release in an isothermal, sealed room <b>mechanically</b> mixed with <b>variable</b> power blowers. Predictions of mixing time were found in good agreement with experimental measurements, over an order of magnitude variation in blower power. Additional CFD simulations were performed to investigate the relation between pollutant mixing time and source location. Seventeen source locations and five blower configurations were investigated. Results clearly show large dependence of the mixing time on the room airflow, with some dependence on source location. We further explore dependence of mixing time on the velocity and turbulence intensity at the source location. Implications for positioning air-toxic sensors in rooms are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Studies of {{a diverse}} array of animals have found that young {{individuals}} often have robust bones for their body size (i. e. augmented cross- sectional dimensions), limiting fracture risk despite general musculoskeletal immaturity. However, previous research has focused primar- ily on precocial taxa (e. g. rodents, lagomorphs, bovids, goats and emu). In this study, we exam- ined the ontogenetic scaling of humeral and femoral cross-sectional robusticity in a mixed- longitudinal sample of two slow-growing, behaviourally altricial capuchin monkeys. Results showed that, when regressed against bio- <b>mechanically</b> appropriate size <b>variables</b> (i. e. the product of body mass and bone length), humeral and femoral bending strengths generally scale with negative allometry, matching the scaling patterns observed in previous studies of more precocial mammals. Additionally, bone strength relative to predicted loads (e. g. â€˜safety factorsâ€™) peaks at birth and rapidly decreases during post- natal growth, falling to less than 5 per cent of peak values by weaning age. We suggest that increased safety factors during early ontogeny may be an adaptation to mitigate injury from falling during initial locomotor efforts. Overall, the results presented here suggest that ontogen- etic declines in relative long bone strength may represent a common pattern among mammals that is perhaps preadaptive for different purposes among different lineage...|$|R
40|$|During {{harvesting}} of crops, such as sugar beet, {{potatoes and}} chicory roots, considerable quantities of soil, consisting of adhering soil, soil clods and stones, are exported from cropland. This soil erosion process is called soil loss due to crop harvesting (SLCH). This study aimed {{to assess the}} variability in soil losses caused by potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) harvesting in Belgium and to investigate the role of weather conditions prior to the harvest and regional differences in soil texture on SLCH variability. To meet these objectives, more than 1000 soil tare data measured at a potato -processing factory during the harvesting seasons of 1999, 2000 and 2001 were analysed. Soil loss was on an average 2. 2 t ha(- 1) per harvest but could be as large as 45 t ha(- 1) per harvest. The average soil losses per municipality were positively and exponentially related to the average content of soil particles < 16 mu m. This relationship was {{in close agreement with}} a previous field study on SLCH for potatoes in Belgium and could explain why measured soil loss values from a German study were larger than SLCH values for potatoes measured in Belgium. Weather conditions prior to harvest played only a minor role for SLCH variability. As a consequence, SLCH for potatoes harvested <b>mechanically</b> is more <b>variable</b> in space than in time. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This works {{examines}} {{the question whether}} a vapour-liquid phase transition exists in systems of particles with purely dipolar interactions, a topic {{which has been the}} subject of a longstanding debate. Monte Carlo simulation results for two modi operandi to tackle this issue are presented. One approach {{examines the}} phase behaviour of fluids of charged hard dumbbells (CHD), each made up of two oppositely charged hard spheres with diameters Ïƒ and separation d. In the limit d/Ïƒ â†’ 0, and with the temperature scaled accordingly, the system corresponds to dipolar hard spheres (DHS) while for larger values of d ionic interactions are dominant. The crossover between ionic and dipolar regimes is examined and a linear variation of the critical temperature T*c in dipolar reduced units as a function of d is observed, giving rise to an extrapolated T*cDHS â‰ˆ 0 : 15. The second approach focuses on the dipolar Yukawa hard sphere (DYHS) fluid, which is given by a dipolar hard sphere and an attractive isotropic interaction Y of the Yukawa tail form. In this case, the DHS limit is obtained for Y â†’ 0. It is found that T*c depends linearly on the isotropic interaction strength Y over a wide range, coinciding with the results for the CHD model and extrapolating to a similar value of T*c;DHS. However, with the use of specially adapted biased Monte Carlo techniques which are highly efficient, it is shown that the linear variation of T*c is violated for very small values of the Yukawa interaction strength, almost two orders of magnitude smaller than the characteristic dipolar interaction energy. It is found that phase separation is not observable beyond a critical value of the Yukawa energy parameter, even though in thermodynamic and structural terms, the DYHS and DHS systems are very similar. It is suggested that either some very subtle physics distinguishes the DYHS and DHS systems, or the observation of a phase transition in DHSs is precluded by finite-size effects. In the context of phase separation in highly correlated fluids, new flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulation techniques based on the Wang-Landau algorithm are evaluated and shown to be useful tools. This work presents a general and unifying framework for deriving Monte Carlo acceptance rules which facilitate flat histogram sampling. The framework yields uniform sampling rules for thermodynamic states given either by the <b>mechanically</b> extensive <b>variables</b> appearing in the Hamiltonian or, equivalently, uniformly sample the thermodynamic fields which are conjugate to these mechanical variables.

40|$|The {{effects of}} scale on the {{estimated}} stresses and safety {{factors in the}} humeri of several bird and bat species were investigated. This was accomplished by estimating the lift distribution across the wings at two extremes of flight, gliding flight and the downstroke in hovering, finding the center of lift on the wings at these two extremes and calculating the applied bending and twisting moments. This information, along with measurements of <b>mechanically</b> important morphological <b>variables,</b> allowed for estimates of bending and shearing stresses in the humeri for both gliding flight and on the downstroke in hovering. The stresses in flapping flight other than hovering should fall somewhere between these two values. It {{was found that the}} stresses in the humeri are not scale-dependent and that the bending stresses are slightly lower than those found in the limbs of terrestrial animals, while the shearing stresses are larger than those in terrestrial limbs. The breaking stress of bird and bat wing bone was also investigated. Both materials were found to have a lower breaking stress than that of typical long bone material. The ratio between the breaking stress of the material and the estimated stresses was defined as the safety factor. Bird humeri have safety factors that are generally greater than those of bat humeri. This is because bat bone has a lower breaking stress than does bird bone, although the estimated stresses in the wings are similar. The mean safety factor against failure due to bending in gliding flight was 6. 63 for birds and 3. 99 for bats. In hovering, the mean safety factors against failure due to bending were 2. 22 for birds and 1. 41 for bats. The safety factors against failure due to shearing stresses were estimated to be seven time greater than those against failure due to pure bending stresses...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{composite}} slabs {{is common}} {{because of its}} acceptance, technical quality and economic advantages. Design concepts for bending and longitudinal shear of the composite slabs are already embedded in the standardization. For the verification of the shear force capacity of composite slabs, the code of composite elements refers to the semi-empirical regulations for massive concrete beams without shear reinforcement. These empirical rules were not adapted to the specific bearing behaviour of composite slabs and a discrete model for composite slabs under shear load is missing. Latest investigations with composite slabs and structural lightweight aggregate concrete revealed a safety deficit in case of shear failure. The inaccuracy {{in the description of}} the failure mode depended on an unfavourable ratio between concrete tensile strength and compressive strength and interacts with the anchorage of the longitudinal reinforcement. Within the scope of this project the failure mechanisms of vertical shear in composite slabs were separated and described in their effect in order to develop a suitable shear model. For this purpose, shear tests on composite slabs with varying plate geometry and an alternating combination with normal and lightweight con-crete were performed. A <b>mechanically</b> justified, <b>variable</b> design model for composite slaps subjected to shear forces was formulated from the gain in knowledge. The model is characterized by a variable formulation. It can be adapted to varying sheet geometries and is valid for lightweight and normal weight concrete. The previously neglected shear bearing capacity of the metal sheet was taken into account. The shear model is composed by the vertical bearing components of the metal sheet, the uncracked compression zone and the activatible part of the fracture process zone. The components act in an additive manner. Thus, a first proposal of a closed solution for the shear design of composite slabs has been developed, which allows an efficient and safe utilization of this ceiling system. As the different bearing effects have been described individually, substitions or supplements of bearing mechanisms are easy. In future, the integration of the effect of fiber-reinforced concrete is conceivable. For the first time a research project dealt with an analysis for steel composite slabs under shear force. The findings allow conclusions on the structural behavior of composite slabs and the differences to reinforced concrete beams. This provides the basis for further research approaches. An extensive data collection was performed and recorded in a database of composite slabs with vertical shear failure in order to support further investigations. Verbunddecke ist ein Deckensystem, das Akzeptanz und Wirtschaftlichkeit bei gleichzeitig ausgereifter bautechnischer QualitÃ¤t vereint. Nachweiskonzepte zur BiegetragfÃ¤higkeit und LÃ¤ngsschubtragfÃ¤higkeit wurden bereits fÃ¼r normative Regelungen erarbeitet. FÃ¼r die Bemessung unter Querkraft orientiert sich das Regelwerk fÃ¼r Verbundbau am Nachweiskonzept fÃ¼r Massivbauteile. Eine eigenstÃ¤ndige, an die besondere konstruktive Gestaltung von Verbunddecken angepasste Bemessung ist nicht vorhanden. Bisher wird somit ein empirisch gestÃ¼tztes Querkraftmodell verwendet, dessen statistische Kalibrierung ohne BerÃ¼cksichtigung von Verbunddeckenversuchen vorgenommen wurde. Neuere Untersuchungen an Verbunddecken mit gefÃ¼gedichtem Leichtbeton zeigten, dass bei einem ungÃ¼nstigen VerhÃ¤ltnis der Zug- zur Druckfestigkeit des Betons und in AbhÃ¤ngigkeit der Verankerung der LÃ¤ngsbewehrung relevante Sicherheitsdefizite infolge Querkraftversagen auftreten kÃ¶nnen. Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit wurden die das Querkraftversagen bei Verbunddecken auslÃ¶senden Mechanismen separiert und in ihrer Wirkung beschrieben. Hierzu wurden eine Vielzahl von Querkraftversuchen an Verbunddecken mit variierender Blechgeometrie und in wechselnder Kombination mit Normal- und Leichtbeton durchgefÃ¼hrt. Aus dem Zugewinn an Erkenntnissen wurde ein mechanisch begrÃ¼ndetes, variables Bemessungsmodell fÃ¼r Verbunddecken unter Querkraftbeanspruchung formuliert. Das Modell zeichnet sich durch die BerÃ¼cksichtigung der bisher vernachlÃ¤ssigten EigentragfÃ¤higkeit des Verbundblechs aus und kann zudem flexibel an die verwendete Betonart sowie an variierende Blechgeometrien angepasst werden. Das Querkraftmodell setzt sich aus den additiv wirkenden Traganteilen des Blechs, der ungerissenen Druckzone sowie der aktivierten Bruchprozesszone zusammen. Damit wurde ein geschlossener LÃ¶sungsvorschlag zur Querkraftbemessung erarbeitet, welcher eine optimale und sichere Ausnutzung des Deckensystems ermÃ¶glicht.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesBackground: Assessment of {{intracranial}} pressure (ICP) {{is an essential}} aspect {{in the management of}} most neurosurgical conditions in children. While invasive ICP monitoring is considered the criterion standard, the need for a reliable, non-invasive, easy-to-use and accurate method to detect and monitor raised ICP has inspired the development of many useful techniques. The present study examined the relationship between transorbital ultrasound measurement of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and invasively measured ICP in children, as well as the influence of relevant physiological and demographic variables on this relationship. Methodology: ONSD measurement was performed using a high frequency, small footprint linear array probe, and prior to invasive ICP measurement. All patients were under general anaesthesia and being <b>mechanically</b> ventilated. Physiological <b>variables</b> including systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulse rate, temperature, respiratory rate and end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO 2) level were recorded at the time of ONSD measurement. The ONSD measurements were analysed for repeatability, intra- and inter-observer variability as well for correlation between images acquired in different planes and those obtained from either eye. The diagnostic accuracy of ONSD measurement for detecting ICP at different thresholds of 20, 15, 10 and 5 mmHg was analysed. This analysis included evaluation of age-related thresholds for defining different ONSD cut-off values in children. Dynamic image acquisition was performed and analysed to evaluate the relevant pulsatile motion of the ONS as a marker of the sheath stiffness. Results: One hundred and seventy four children undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic surgical procedures were included in this study. ONSD measurement demonstrated good correlation with ICP across the entire patient cohort (r = 0. 66, p 1 year or with a closed anterior fontanelle (AF) (r = 0. 7, p < 0. 001). Age above and below 1 year was found to be an appropriate age threshold for defining two different sets of ONSD cut-off values. The study however, supported using patency of the AF as a stronger clinical marker for describing different ONSD cut-off values in children. The second part of this work described a dynamic technique for analysing the pulsatile motion of the ONS. Analysis of the deformability index (DI) as an indirect marker of ONS stiffness, revealed a statistically significant relationship with ICP (sensitivity of 90 %, specificity of 87 % for detecting ICP â‰¥ 20 mmHg). Conclusion: Measurement of the ONSD is a sensitive surrogate marker of raised ICP, but demonstrated poorer specificity. This relationship was more reliable in older children, particularly when the AF was closed. Analysis of the dynamic characteristics of the ONS appeared to provide useful additional information as an independent marker, and may contribute to our overall understanding of ONSD measurement in raised ICP...|$|R
