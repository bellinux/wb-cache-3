50|$|Oxypertine (Equipertine, Forit, Integrin, Lanturil, Lotawin, Opertil) is an {{antipsychotic}} used in {{the treatment}} of schizophrenia. It was also evaluated for the treatment of anxiety at a dosage of 20 mg per day. Chemically, it is an indole derivative similarly to molindone {{and a member of the}} phenylpiperazine class. Like reserpine and tetrabenazine, oxypertine depletes catecholamines, though not serotonin, possibly underlying its neuroleptic efficacy. The molecular structure is strongly similar to solypertine and <b>milipertine.</b>|$|E
