50|$|The Canadian courts {{recognize}} the ongoing financial responsibility of separated spouses {{to their children}} and {{to each other and}} regularly issue <b>maintenance</b> <b>orders,</b> which are court orders requiring one party (the payor) to provide payments to another party (the recipient) for the support of the children and/or the other party. By providing services to both payors and recipients, the FMEP ensures that the terms of these <b>maintenance</b> <b>orders</b> are fulfilled. The FMEP’s services are available on an opt-in basis to most parents who live in British Columbia and who have valid <b>maintenance</b> <b>orders</b> or agreements filed with any court in Canada, the United States, or in other countries with which British Columbia has reciprocal agreements.|$|E

Unfortunately, in some situations, a claimant does not get what is awarded to her and her children because the defendants (ex-husbands) do not pay. Unknown to some claimants, it is in fact their duty to proceed with the enforcement of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>order</b> to get paid. This research, therefore, is designed to identify the obstacles in enforcing the <b>maintenance</b> <b>order</b> of the Syariah Court and to suggest possibilities to overcome the problems in enforcing the said order. The data for this research is sourced from personal interview with the Chief Registrar of the Melaka Syariah Court. Thereafter, questionnaires were designed based on the said interview and distributed to all the 29 Syarie lawyers who are in active practice in Melaka. It was found that the main obstacle in enforcing the <b>maintenance</b> <b>order</b> is the negative attitudes of the parties. The study also revealed that the whereabouts of the ex-husband is crucial in determining whether the <b>maintenance</b> <b>order</b> could be enforced because all modes of executing the order would require information of the ex-husband's whereabouts. Among the recommendations made in this study are to amend certain laws and to revamp the current education syllabus to instill positive attitudes...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Maintenance</b> <b>orders</b> can {{be given}} on nominal or {{specific}} terms.

If, on the other hand, it makes an order, it can later vary it. This is why an order for periodical payments at the rate of 5 pence per year (the usual nominal order) is known as a nominal order - it gives the recipient the right to come back and make an application for a substantive monthly sum at a later date.|$|E
