40|$|The {{continuous}} plankton recorder (CPR) {{survey is}} an upper layer plankton monitoring {{program that has}} regularly collected samples, at monthly intervals, in the North Atlantic and adjacent seas since 1946. Water from approximately 6 m depth enters the CPR through a small aperture {{at the front of}} the sampler and travels down a tunnel where it passes through a silk filtering mesh of 270 µm before exiting at the back of the CPR. The plankton filtered on the silk is analyzed in sections corresponding to 10 nautical miles (approx. 3 m** 3 of seawater filtered) and the plankton microscopically identified (Richardson et al., 2006 and reference therein). In the present study we used the CPR data to investigate the current basin scale distribution of C. finmarchicus (C 5 -C 6), C. helgolandicus (C 5 -C 6), C. hyperboreus (C 5 -C 6), Pseudocalanus spp. (C 6), Oithona spp. (C 1 -C 6), total Euphausiida, total Thecosomata and the presence/absence of Cnidaria and the Phytoplankton Colour Index (PCI). The PCI, which is a visual assessment of the greenness of the silk, is used as an indicator of the distribution of total phytoplankton biomass across the Atlantic basin (Batten et al., 2003). Monthly data collected between 2000 and 2009 were gridded using the inverse-distance interpolation method, in which the interpolated values were the nodes of a 2 degree by 2 degree grid. The resulting twelve <b>monthly</b> <b>matrices</b> were then averaged within the year and in the case of the zooplankton the data were log-transformed (i. e. log 10 (x+ 1) ...|$|R
40|$|The Nimbus 7 ERB MATRIX Tape is a {{computer}} program in which radiances and irradiances are converted into fluxes which are used to compute the basic scientific output parameters, emitted flux, albedo, and net radiation. They are spatially averaged and presented as time averages over one-day, six-day, and <b>monthly</b> periods. <b>MATRIX</b> data for the period November 16, 1978 through October 31, 1979 are presented. Described are the Earth Radiation Budget experiment, the Science Quality Control Report, Items checked by the MATRIX Science Quality Control Program, and Science Quality Control Data Analysis Report. Additional material from the detailed scientific quality control of the tapes which may be very useful to a user of the MATRIX tapes is included. Known errors and data problems and some {{suggestions on how to}} use the data for further climatologic and atmospheric physics studies are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Habitat {{loss and}} {{fragmentation}} {{are some of}} the causes of biodiversity decline. Naturally fragmented landscapes serve as analogues to anthropogenically fragmented landscapes. Recent {{studies have shown that the}} matrix between patches has an important role in the dynamics of patch-dwelling species. I studied phenology and habitat utilization of Hyla cinerea and Hyla squirella, the two most common yet understudied frogs, in two patchy landscapes of the Big Cypress National Preserve. Frogs were sampled in five domes and in their adjacent <b>matrix,</b> <b>monthly,</b> between 2006 and 2008. Using nighttime visual encounter surveys, specimens encountered were identified to species, and perch type, perch height and capture location were recorded. Analysis showed differences in abundance and habitat use patterns between patches and matrices for the two species across the two landscapes. These differences indicate that the matrix is important in shaping patterns of abundance and habitat use in fragmented landscapes...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a photovoltaic system auto sizing algorithm with irradiance and shading calculation, which uses the photovoltaic {{geographical information system}} database. This calculation step is a very labor intensive task, which {{require a lot of}} iterative design time to find the optimum alternative. Based on measurement data, <b>monthly</b> irradiance correction <b>matrixes</b> are simulated to completely describe the yearly irradiance loss caused by shading of the nearby objects. As result, a function between the shaded area and the yearly energy loss can be obtained. Furthermore, photovoltaic modules can be auto-allocated on a given area according to the boundary conditions. Taking into consideration the photovoltaic installers’ pricing system, a complete photovoltaic auto-sizing algorithm can be presented, which greatly reduces the time spent on quotation writing. This paper also includes a battery energy storage sizing algorithm according to the given economic conditions, which extends the capability of the photovoltaic system auto-sizing algorithm...|$|R
40|$|Weather {{generators}} are tools used to downscale monthly to seasonal climate forecasts, from numerical {{climate models}} to daily values {{for use as}} inputs for crop and other environmental models. One main limitation of most of weather generators {{is that they do}} not incorporate neither the spatial/temporal correlations between/within sites nor the cross-correlations between variables, characteristics specially important when aggregating, for example, simulated crop yields, freeze events, or heat waves in a watershed or region. Three models were developed to generate realization of daily maximum and minimum temperatures for multiple sites. The first model incorporates only spatial correlation, whereas temporal correlation using a 1 -day lag and cross-correlation between variables were added to model one, respectively, by the other two models. Vectors of correlated random numbers were rescaled to temperature values by multiplying each element with the standard deviation and adding the mean of the corresponding weather station. An extension of Crout's algorithm was developed to enable the factorization of nonpositive definite <b>matrices.</b> <b>Monthly</b> spatial correlations of generated daily maximum and minimum temperatures between all pairs of weather stations closely matched their observed counterparts. Performance was analyzed by comparing the root mean squared error, temporal semivariograms, correlation/cross-correlation <b>matrices,</b> multiannual <b>monthly</b> means, and standard deviations...|$|R
40|$|For {{a credit}} portfolio, {{we are often}} {{interested}} in modelling the migration of accounts between credit grades over time. For a large retail portfolio, data on credit grade migration may be available only {{in the form of}} a series of (typically <b>monthly)</b> population transition <b>matrices</b> representing the gross flow of accounts between each pair of credit grades in the given time period. The challenge is to model the transition process on the basis of these aggregate flow matrices. Each row of an observed transition matrix represents a sample from an ordinal probability distribution. Following [Malik, M. and Thomas, L. C. (2012). Transition matrix models of consumer credit ratings. International Journal of Forecasting, 28, 261 - 272. ], [Feng, D., Gourieroux, C. and Jasiak, J. (2008). The ordered qualitative model for credit rating transitions. Journal of Empirical Finance, 15, 111 - 130. ] and [McNeil, A. J. and Wendin, J. P. (2006). Dependent credit migrations. Journal of Credit Risk, 2, 87 - 114. ], we assume a cumulative link model for these ordinal distributions. Common choices of link function are based on the normal (probit link) or logistic distributions, but the fit to observed data can be poor. In this paper, we investigate the fit of alternative link specifications based on the t-distribution. Such distributions arise naturally when modelling data which arise through aggregating an inhomogeneous sample of obligors, by combining a simple structural-type model for credit migration at the obligor level, with a suitable mixing distribution to model the variability between obligors...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{application}} of the simulation-dynamic programming approach {{for the evolution of}} a water regulation policy for the Pantabangan reservoir of the Upper Pampanga River Project, in conjunction with two tributary reservoir systems: the Aurora Transbasin Diversion Project and the proposed Casecnan River Project. The study may be decomposed into three sequential phases: 1) a reservoir operations simulation study of the existing two-reservoir system and the three-reservoir configurations for three alternative Casecnan dam locations. The operations simulation was centered at the Pantabangan reservoir and was performed under parametric conditions of invariant service area cropping pattern, power generation, flood control release schedules, and average system microclimate. The principal variables were the reservoir system and service area runoffs which were inputted as synthetic streamflow traces. The results of the simulation study, in the form of Pantabangan irrigation and power releases, were inputted for optimization in 2) a dynamic programming model which is of the explicit stochastic type. The probabilistic property of the model is ascribed to the use of lag-one <b>monthly</b> transition probability <b>matrices</b> and relative frequency matrices to respectively characterize the behavior of the unregulated Pantabangan reservoir inflows and the transbasin diversions. Due to the rough discretization procedure conducted on the optimization variables, the determined operations policy was tested in 3) a feasibility simulation model which features essentially the same parameters and variables of the operations model. Two sets of policies were tested under the two- and three-reservoir arrangements. The first is a constrained policy based on a minimum Pantabangan reservoir storage greater than the physical minimum. The unconstrained policy was based on dead storage as the minimum...|$|R

Para verificaÃÃo de ajuste das curvas de variaÃÃo das funÃÃes distribuiÃÃo dos modelos gama e log-normal foi utilizado o mÃtodo de Kolmogorov-Smirnov, para o modelo generalizado de valores extremos a verificaÃÃo do ajuste utilizou-se do mÃtodo de Wang. Como resultado, foi observada a variaÃÃo mensal dos valores de evapotranspiraÃÃo no Estado, ao longo dos meses. Verificou-se a tendÃncia de regiÃes mais ao norte apresentarem os maiores valores estimados de lÃmina de evapotranspiraÃÃo e nas estaÃÃes situadas em Ãreas de maiores altitudes relativas apresentarem menores valores de lÃminas. Quanto aos modelos gama, log-normal e generalizada de valores extremos, utilizados para estimativa da evapotranspiraÃÃo potencial, ajustaram se satisfatoriamente. Com os valores de cada mÃs, considerando a probabilidade de 75 % de ocorrÃncia, em cada uma das estaÃÃes, foi montado o mapa das isolinhas que representa a variabilidade da evapotranspiraÃÃo potencial, segundo o modelo gama, sobre a base cartogrÃfica do estado do ParanÃ.
