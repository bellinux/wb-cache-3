5|$|While {{the guests}} search for clues in {{discovering}} the killer's identity, they realise {{that many of}} them had motives for wanting revenge on James Woods. Tom did not take the part of Freddy Krueger in A Nightmare on Elm Street due to James advising him not to, Brian had the pilot of his series <b>messed</b> <b>up</b> by James, and Quagmire lost Cheryl Tiegs due to him, while Consuela the Mexican maid says he molested her nephew, causing him to 'shoot himself in the face'. After reading a notebook belonging to Woods and found in a secret room, Mort Goldman's wife, Muriel, disappears after it is discovered that she was being blackmailed by Woods, causing everyone to suspect her as the culprit. Peter accidentally got Joe knocked out, so organizes the groups, however several of them are separated from each other due to the secret passages. However, Muriel turns up dead soon after by being stabbed in the back with the same knife that killed James, placing suspicion on Priscilla, who also disappeared during the commotion. Jillian's husband, Derek goes to an upper balcony to find a cell phone signal and contact the police, but is soon murdered by the unseen killer with one of Woods's Golden Globe Awards. The guests search everyone's rooms until they locate the bloodstained award and Priscilla's dead body in Tom Tucker's guest room. Tom is thus implicated as the killer and is chased and caught by Peter, Joe, Carl, Dr. Hartman, Quagmire, Seamus, and Mayor Adam West.|$|E

25|$|The Spanish Grand Prix {{had moved}} from the Jerez circuit near Seville to the brand-new Catalunya circuit near Barcelona, {{on the other side}} of Spain. Berger took pole in Spain ahead of Mansell, Senna, Patrese, Schumacher and Prost. At the start, it was damp and Senna blasted past Mansell while Patrese <b>messed</b> <b>up</b> again, {{dropping}} to sixth. Midway through the lap, Schumacher passed Mansell to take third. The order was: Berger, Senna, Schumacher, Mansell, Prost and Patrese.|$|E
25|$|Mansell quickly reeled in Berger and got {{ahead on}} lap 20 and {{proceeded}} to pull away. Schumacher now came to attack Berger and when he tried, he <b>messed</b> <b>up</b> and spun off. He rejoined back down in sixth. On lap 33, Berger slowed down with electrical troubles and retired. Soon afterwards, Patrese passed Senna for third. Schumacher had blistered his tyres in the spin and pitted, dropping behind Alesi who charged forward and passed Senna. Mansell crucially won from Prost, Patrese, Alesi, Senna and Schumacher.|$|E
25|$|Mansell quickly passed Berger {{and then}} Barrichello {{to get up}} to fourth. During the stops, Hill <b>messed</b> <b>up</b> and the team, afraid that he would lose the lead, sent him back out too quickly without giving him enough fuel. Schumacher however was already ahead and Hill had to stop again for fuel. When he rejoined, he was over 20 seconds behind. Mansell too was slow and Barrichello was ahead of him. Mansell tried to pass him and there was contact. Both had to pit, with Mansell {{dropping}} to seventh and Barrichello going well down.|$|E

Mars' and Marley's vocals range spans from the low note of G3 to the high note of C6. The track is three minutes and fifty nine seconds. The song's lyrics describe feelings of [...] "pain" [...] and [...] "sorrow", using alcohol as method to flee [...] "bad fortune in an odd foreshadowing of events".

500|$|One of the {{characteristics}} of the drumming style implemented in recording the album is its adherence to human timing, as the tracks were mostly programmed mechanically during recording, therefore resulting in the album's intentional sloppiness. In a later interview, Questlove discussed the intention and purpose of including imperfection in the album's sound, stating [...] "we wanted to play as perfectly as we could, but then deliberately insert the little glitch that makes it sound <b>messed</b> <b>up.</b> The idea was to sound disciplined, but with a total human feel." ...|$|E

The episode was also the first time Mr. Garrison was portrayed as an anti-semite and racist, particularly when he asks Mayor McDaniels if she can get rid of all the Mexicans in South Park. Parker said this decision was made because, [...] "Garrison at that point had already shown himself to be the most <b>messed</b> <b>up</b> person in the entire town, and there's obviously so much wrong with him mentally.

500|$|Parker and Stone said {{a number}} of Cartman's {{characteristics}} which have endured throughout the South Park series started in [...] "Damien".
