5|$|Another {{earthquake}} hit Sidon around 570 AD; Antoninus of Piacenza, an Italian Christian pilgrim, {{described the}} city as partly in ruins. For <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>after</b> {{the disappearance of the}} cult of Eshmun, the sanctuary site was used as a quarry: Emir Fakhr-al-Din II, for example, used its massive blocks to build a bridge over the Awali river in the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|For <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>after</b> Curry's death, McGugin {{had three}} {{photographs}} displayed over his desk. The three pictures were of Abraham Lincoln, Robert E. Lee, and Curry. McGugin read military history, and before a tough game enjoyed reading about Lee's strategies.|$|E

5|$|In adulthood, Braille {{served as}} a {{professor}} at the Institute and had an avocation as a musician, but he largely spent the remainder of his life refining and extending his system.

5|$|Influenced by George Bell, Stokes {{was part}} of the Melbourne Contemporary Artists, a group Bell {{established}} in 1940.

His father Shankar Narayana (Prakash Raj) awakes from a coma, {{which he has been}} in for <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>after</b> an accident, but his health remains perilous. To aid his recovery, Kumar masquerades as a Member of the Legislative Assembly fulfilling his father's ambition for him.|$|E
5|$|Progression from TB {{infection}} to overt TB disease {{occurs when}} the bacilli overcome the immune system defenses and begin to multiply. In primary TB disease (some 1–5% of cases), this occurs soon after the initial infection. However, {{in the majority of}} cases, a latent infection occurs with no obvious symptoms. These dormant bacilli produce active tuberculosis in 5–10% of these latent cases, often <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>after</b> infection.|$|E
5|$|For <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>after</b> his death, Scott's {{status as}} tragic hero was unchallenged, and few {{questions}} were asked {{about the causes of}} the disaster which overcame his polar party. In the final quarter of the 20th century the expedition came under closer scrutiny, and more critical views were expressed about its organization and management. The degree of Scott's personal culpability, and more recently, the culpability of certain expedition members, remain controversial.|$|E

5|$|For <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>after</b> its discovery, the {{evolutionary}} origins of Triceratops remained largely obscure. In 1922, the newly discovered Protoceratops {{was seen as}} its ancestor by Henry Fairfield Osborn, but many decades passed before additional findings came to light. Recent years have been fruitful for the discovery of several dinosaurs related to ancestors of Triceratops. Zuniceratops, the earliest known ceratopsian with brow horns, was described in the late 1990s, and Yinlong, the first known Jurassic ceratopsian, in 2005.|$|E
5|$|If {{bacteria}} form a parasitic {{association with}} other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria {{are a major}} cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>after,</b> {{as was the case with}} Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease. Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.|$|E
5|$|In {{his pursuit}} of a {{unification}} of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the strong and weak nuclear forces, which were not well understood until <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>after</b> his death. Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein's approaches to unification. Einstein's dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a theory of everything and in particular string theory, where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.|$|E

5|$|Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's operas {{comprise}} 22 musical dramas in {{a variety}} of genres. They range from the small-scale, derivative works of his youth to the full-fledged operas of his maturity. Three of the works were abandoned before completion and were not performed until <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>after</b> the composer's death. His mature works are all considered classics and have never been out of the repertory of the world's opera houses.|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} Arbeideren went defunct, the Communist Party gave {{its name to}} a new {{newspaper}}, which was set up as the new main newspaper of the Communist Party in 1930. This new paper was based in Oslo as the replacement of Norges Kommunistblad, which had been liquidated as well. Olav Larssen and Evald Solbakken found a new outlet in Hamar Arbeiderblad, which {{had been set up}} as the new Hamar organ of the Labour Party in 1925. The Communist Party later tried to create a weekly newspaper in Hamar, Rød Front, but it was short-lived and existed only between 1932 and 1933. The Oslo version of Arbeideren went defunct in 1940, and <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>after</b> that, the name was used from 1951 to 1953 for a third newspaper, published in Brumunddal, not far from Hamar city.|$|E

5|$|A {{scientist}} with a PhD in plant physiology, Marshall became independently wealthy {{after the death}} of his father in 1929. He had started his outdoor career in 1925 as forester with the U.S. Forest Service. He used his financial independence for expeditions to Alaska and other wilderness areas. Later he held two significant public appointed posts: chief of forestry in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, from 1933 to 1937, and head of recreation management in the Forest Service, from 1937 to 1939, both during the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During this period, he directed the promulgation of regulations to preserve large areas of roadless land that were under federal management. <b>Many</b> <b>years</b> <b>after</b> his death, some of those areas were permanently protected from development, exploitation, and mechanization with the passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964.|$|E
5|$|Although Fox {{insisted on}} {{maintaining}} CinemaScope for a time, some actors disliked the system. For Fox's 1965 production Von Ryan's Express, Frank Sinatra reputedly demanded that Auto Panatar lenses be used. Such pressures led Fox to completely abandon CinemaScope for Auto Panatars that year; Von Ryan's Express was the studio's first picture with Panavision lenses. To meet the extraordinary demand for Panavision projection lenses, Gottschalk had Bausch & Lomb CinemaScope lenses retrofitted into Panavision housings {{with a new}} astigmatic attachment, improving them greatly. This was revealed <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>after</b> Gottschalk's death; a lead designer from Bausch & Lomb, who had {{been involved with the}} original CinemaScope project, came to work as a designer for Panavision and—after opening some of the older lenses—figured out the secret.|$|E
