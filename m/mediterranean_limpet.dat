40|$|Bioerosion is the {{biological}} breakdown of hard substrates by boring, grazing, etchting and abrading organisms. Many marine intertidal gastropods, such as limpets, {{contribute to the}} erosion by grazing rock substrate {{in the search for}} algal food, leaving distinctive marks {{on the surface of the}} rock. The present work focuses on the laboratory characterisation and the description of the scratches leaved in an artificial surface (dental wax plates) by the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>limpet</b> Patella rustica in their feeding activit...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Mediterranean</b> Patella <b>limpets</b> (P. rustica, P. ferruginea, P. caerulea and P. ulyssiponensis), occupy {{different}} {{positions in the}} shore. This stratification subjects them {{to a variety of}} environmental stresses. Shell and radula characters, as well as the (shell surface area/shell volume) ratio were investigated in these four species. We reported inter-specific differences in shell shape, radula relative size and the (SSA/SV) ratio among these limpets. The ecological implications of these strutural adaptations for species survival in their respective niches are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{spermatozoon}} morphology of 19 {{species of}} Indo-Pacific, East Atlantic and <b>Mediterranean</b> patellid <b>limpets</b> was examined by transmission electron microscopy. All nine species of Patella and Helcion from the South Atlantic (southern Africa) and the Indo-Pacific, {{as well as}} three species from the North Atlantic, have sperm which correspond {{to one of the}} sperm groups I, II or III, previously described for patellacean limpets from southern Africa (Hodgson & Bernard 1988). With the exception of P. safiana and P. canescens, all 7 Patella species from the N. E. Atlantic/Mediterranean have sperm morphologies which closely resemble one another but are distinctly different from the sperm types of species in the southern hemisphere. These N. E. Atlantic/Mediterraean limpets have been assigned to a new sperm group, group VI. On the basis of sperm structure it is suggested that patellid limpets had three main centres of radiation: a N. E. Atlantic/Mediterranean centre; an East Atlantic centre with its focal point on the S. W. coast of southern Africa; an Indo-Pacific centre with its focal point on the S. E. coast of South Africa. Despite similarities between the species within groups, each has a unique sperm. An examination of spermatozoa of one patellid from Namibia and one from S. Angola (both initially identified as Patella miniata), has revealed that their sperm are distinctly different, as well being different from that of P. miniata from South Africa. Subsequently, the species from Namibia was identified as P. adansonii. Furthermore, P. cf. miniata from S. Angola had a sperm which is remarkably similar to that of P. safiana from N. W. Africa and the two may be conspecific...|$|R
40|$|In 1990 Depledge and Andresen {{developed}} a #eld/laboratory, non-invasive technique {{to monitor the}} immediate response of cardiac activity in bivalves. Since then, several researchers have experienced and tested the variability of heart beat rate (HBR) and of associated metabolic rates under dierent conditions in intertidal molluscs. Review of HBR immediate response in acute exposure and acclimation to changes of salinity, thermal stressors and air exposure were examined to test dierent hypothesis. In intertidal <b>Mediterranean</b> and tropical <b>limpets,</b> the decrease in metabolic rate with a decrease in salinity was dierent in animals experiencing dierent degrees of salinity !uctuation in their respective microhabitats. Intertidal limpets respond to temperature increases, increasing HBR and metabolic rate. Furthermore, when reaching the highest temperature experienced in #eld, HBR shows extreme responses as secondary bradicardia. Finally, when exposed to dry/saturated air cycles, lower shore intertidal limpets show regular alternation of normal HBR and acardia, whilst the upper shore limpet showed transient acardia only during exposure to dry air. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that dierent patterns of immediate HBR responses couple dierent !uctuations of the physical environment experienced by individuals inhabiting dierent levels of the shore...|$|R
40|$|GASTROPODA: PATELLIDAE) Abstract- Patella ferruginea (Gastropoda: Patellidae) is an {{endangered}} marine gastropod, distributed {{on the western}} Mediterranean coasts, whose range has progressively contracted, due to intense human exploitation. Our attention focused on its genetic structure, in order to gather information about levels of genetic variability of P. ferruginea from the Asinara Marine Protected Area and a neighbouring non-protected area. Key-words: endangered species, resource conservation, genetics. Introduction- Marine threatened species comprise the giant <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>limpet</b> Patella ferruginea, considered the most endangered marine macroinvertebrate in the W-Mediterranean, whose intense human exploitation places its populations under serious risk of extinction. P. ferruginea, a protandrous species, shows traits of a k-strategist (see Laborel-Deguen and Laborel, 1991). Such features contribut...|$|E
40|$|The giant <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>limpet</b> Patella ferruginea Gmelin, 1791 is an {{endangered}} marine gastropod, whose range has progressively shrinked to few, restricted areas, due to intense human exploitation. We {{have studied the}} genetic structure of the species, in order to (1) gather information about the levels of genetic variability within and between natural populations of P. ferruginea collected in two Sardinian marine protected areas (MPAs) (Penisola del Sinis&# 8212;Isola di Mal di Ventre and Isola dell&# 8217; Asinara), and (2) make an attempt to find relationships between ecological and biological attributes of the species and the genetic differentiation of the populations studied. The genetic study {{was carried out by}} means of the analysis of ten inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers on a total of 40 individuals collected at four localities. Genetic analysis evidenced (1) medium to high levels of within-population genetic variability, (2) a pattern of genetic structuring that varied with spatial scales, and (3) a strong genetic differentiation between the two MPAs. Although preliminary, these results suggest that gene flow may be present only at very small geographic scale, raising concerns {{on the future of the}} conservation of the species...|$|E
