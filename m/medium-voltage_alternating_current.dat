40|$|The {{effects of}} {{superimposing}} square, sine and triangular <b>alternating</b> <b>currents</b> on a direct current during the electroplating of thin films of Fe-Ni alloys from acidic and alkaline citrate baths under various plating conditions are studied. The {{composition of the}} alloys is found {{to depend on the}} ratio of <b>alternating</b> to direct <b>current,</b> the a. c. frequency and the waveform. The effect of the <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> diminished with increase in the frequency and the <b>alternating</b> to direct <b>current</b> ratio. In addition, the effects of pH and temperature on the alloy composition are also reported. The <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> slightly shifted the cathodic polarization towards the noble direction and decreased the grain size, resulting in smooth and bright deposits.

Westinghouse Electric won the bid to light the Exposition with <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> and it was a key event in the history of AC power, as the company demonstrated to the American public the safety, reliability, and efficiency of a fully integrated <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> system. Tesla showed a series of electrical effects related to <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> as well as his wireless lighting system, using a demonstration he had previously performed throughout America and Europe; these included using high-voltage, high-frequency <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> to light a wireless gas-discharge lamp.|$|R

5|$|In {{engineering}} or household applications, {{current is}} often described as being either direct <b>current</b> (DC) or <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. <b>Alternating</b> <b>current</b> is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this {{takes the form of a}} sine wave. <b>Alternating</b> <b>current</b> thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. <b>Alternating</b> <b>current</b> is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.|$|R
