25|$|Caesar {{was still}} deeply in debt, {{but there was}} <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> as a governor, whether by {{extortion}} or by military adventurism. Caesar had four legions under his command, two of his provinces bordered on unconquered territory, and parts of Gaul {{were known to be}} unstable. Some of Rome's Gallic allies had been defeated by their rivals at the Battle of Magetobriga, {{with the help of a}} contingent of Germanic tribes. The Romans feared these tribes were preparing to migrate south, closer to Italy, and that they had warlike intent. Caesar raised two new legions and defeated these tribes.|$|E
25|$|The {{rise of the}} {{financial}} power of the BCCI had an immense effect on NZ cricket and its players. The BCCI managed to convince other boards not to pick players who had joined the rival Twenty-20 Indian Cricket League. NZ Cricket lost the services of Shane Bond, Lou Vincent, Andre Adams, Hamish Marshall and Daryl Tuffey. The <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> from Twenty-20 cricket in India may have also induced players, such as Craig McMillan and Scott Styris (from Test cricket) to retire earlier {{than they would have}} otherwise. After the demise of the Indian Cricket League Bond and Tuffey again played for NZ.|$|E
25|$|Another {{controversy}} was MCC's {{decision to}} allow members and other spectators to continue to bring limited amounts of alcoholic drinks into the ground at all matches. This decision challenged the ICC, which was attempting to implement a ban on this practice at all international matches around the world. MCC has opted to write to the ICC {{on an annual basis}} to seek permission for members and spectators to import alcohol into Lord's. No other Ground Authority has thought it necessary to seek permission from the ICC for their members and spectators to import alcohol into their cricket ground, there being <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> out of selling alcohol themselves.|$|E

5000|$|Fortunes in prize <b>money</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> at sea as vividly {{depicted}} in the novels of C. S. Forester and Patrick O'Brian. During the American Revolution the combined American naval and privateering prizes totaled nearly $24 million; in the War of 1812, $45 million. Such huge revenues were earned when $200 were a generous year's wages for a sailor; his share of a single prize could fetch ten or twenty times his yearly pay, and taking five or six prizes in one voyage was common.|$|R
25|$|Caesar {{was still}} deeply in debt, {{and there was}} <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> as a provincial governor, whether by {{extortion}} or by military adventurism. Caesar had four legions under his command, two of his provinces, Illyricum and Gallia Narbonensis, bordered on unconquered territory, and independent Gaul {{was known to be}} unstable. Rome's allies the Aedui had been defeated by their Gallic rivals, {{with the help of a}} contingent of Germanic Suebi under Ariovistus, who had settled in conquered Aeduan land, and the Helvetii were mobilising for a mass migration, which the Romans feared had warlike intent. Caesar raised two new legions and defeated first the Helvetii, then Ariovistus, and left his army in winter quarters in the territory of the Sequani, signaling that his interest in the lands outside Gallia Narbonensis would not be temporary.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{great deal}} of <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> in this way. The record breaker was the capture of the Spanish frigate Hermione, which was {{carrying}} treasure in 1762. The value of this was so great that each individual seaman netted £485 ($1.4million in 2008 dollars). The two captains responsible, Evans and Pownall, received £65,000 each ($188.4million). In January 1807 the frigate Caroline took the Spanish San Rafael which brought in £52,000 for her captain, Peter Rainier (who had been only a Midshipman some thirteen months before). All through the wars there are examples of this kind of luck falling on captains. Another famous 'capture' was that of the Spanish frigates Thetis and Santa Brigada which were loaded with gold specie. They were taken by four British frigates who shared the money, each captain receiving £40,730. Each lieutenant got £5,091, the Warrant Officer group, £2,468, the midshipmen £791 and the individual seamen £182.|$|E
25|$|Forfang {{made his}} {{international}} debut in November 2001, with a seventh and eleventh place in two Continental Cup events in Kuusamo. He {{followed up with}} a seventh place in Lahti one month later, {{as well as several}} good results after New Year, including a third place in Courchevel in January. He had made his WorldCup debut in Predazzo in December, and achieved a fourteenth place in Hakuba and a seventh place in Sapporo in January. The 2002–03 season saw Forfang continue his good Continental Cup run, with a double victory in Zakopane in February. However, he did not make it to the final of any World Cup event, the closest being two 32nd places. He did win a silver medal at the Norwegian normal hill championships, albeit in the absence of Romøren, Pettersen, Ljøkelsøy and Bystøl. In the 2003–04 season he only competed in one World Cup event, and achieved a second place as the best result in the Continental Cup. Citing personal problems as well as economic hardships (there was little <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> from the sport), he stated that he had contemplated retirement; however, in March 2004 he made progress as he broke the 200-metre barrer in the hill Vikersundbakken. He was the first person from Northern Norway to achieve this feat.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century, almost a hundred small shore {{stations}} were established - in the South Island at Te Awaiti and Preservation Inlet and later at Stewart Island, Otago, Timaru and Kaikoura and Cloudy Bay. On Banks Peninsula the first shore was at Little Port Cooper in 1836 and by 1842 there were a total of five stations, including Oashore Bay, Ikoraki and Peraki. North of Wellington, there were three whaling stations at Porirua, and five on Kapiti Island. Further north there were also shore stations at New Plymouth and Great Barrier Island. However, by 1840 the whale numbers had declined to the point that little <b>money</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made,</b> and in 1844 the last of the early onshore stations closed.|$|R

50|$|The bridge {{continued}} to operate until 1974. After its closing, the United States Coast Guard eventually determined the bridge <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a navigational hazard. In May 1990, {{they threatened to}} fine the City of Providence US$1000 for each day beyond one year from then that the bridge was neither removed nor illuminated. Though the deadline passed, the Coast Guard delayed imposing any fines until at least 1993, when Federal <b>money</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> available for the bridge's removal. Under the plan, the Federal government and city <b>were</b> each <b>to</b> pay US$250,000 towards the cost of removing it. However, this plan was not executed. Also, the Water Resources Acts of 1986 and 1996 had each approved plans for removing the bridge, but these plans failed to come to fruition as well.|$|R
25|$|It wasn't by {{accident}} that the world's second and third grain elevators were built in Toledo, Ohio and Brooklyn, New York, in 1847. Fledgling American cities, they were connected through an emerging international grain trade of unprecedented proportions. Grain shipments from farms in Ohio were loaded onto ships by elevators at Toledo; these ships were unloaded by elevators at Buffalo that transshipped their grain to canal boats (and, later, rail cars), which were unloaded by elevators in Brooklyn, where the grain was either distributed to East Coast flour mills or loaded for further transshipment to England, the Netherlands, or Germany. But this eastern flow of grain was matched by an equally important flow of people and capital in the opposite direction, that is, from East to West. Because of the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> in grain production and, of course, because of {{the very existence of}} an all-water route to get there, increasing numbers of immigrants in Brooklyn came to Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois to become farmers. More farmers meant more prairies turned into farmlands, which in turn meant increased grain production, which of course meant that more grain elevators would have to be built in places like Toledo, Buffalo, and Brooklyn (and Cleveland, Chicago, and Duluth). It was precisely through this feedback loop of productivity — set in motion by the invention of the grain elevator — that America itself became an agricultural and economic colossus on the world stage: the planet's single largest producer of wheat, corn, oats, and rice, a distinction it claims to this day.|$|E

On August 23, 1910, Maeda wrestled Jack Connell in Havana; {{the result was a}} draw. During 1911, Maeda and Satake were joined in Cuba by Akitaro Ono and Tokugoro Ito. The four men were known as the 'Four Kings of Cuba.' ...|$|E
500|$|In his {{tribute to}} the writer, Bernard Hayes said [...] "Tunis has {{probably}} made good readers of millions of young people." [...] His success with the juvenile audience helped change the publishing industry. Along with writers like Howard Pease, his books demonstrated to publishers that there was <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> in targeting books for teenagers. His influence went beyond simply creating a market for young adult books. [...] "In his attempt to link sports with the communities {{in which they are}} played, he broached some highly significant issues in the literature written for and about America's youth", according to John S. Simmons in John R. Tunis and the Sports Novels for Adolescents: A Little Ahead of His Time. Tunis never considered himself a writer of boys' books, insisting his stories could be read and enjoyed by adults. He felt that the word [...] "juvenile" [...] was an [...] "odious... product of a merchandising age". Despite his dislike of the term, Tunis' novels helped create and shape the juvenile fiction book market.|$|E
50|$|The {{first major}} war of which {{anything}} exact is known was the Hussite War in 1430. The Heiligenstadt parish chronicle reports that in 1429, single Bohemian cohorts destroyed parts of Heiligenstadt {{and the whole}} of Burggrub and Zoggendorf. By paying an immense sum of money, the Margrave Friedrich, who had been summoned for help, {{managed to get the}} Hussite leader Prokop to turn away. The <b>money</b> had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> up through special taxes paid by the subjects.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1887 the {{government}} of the ZAR bought the south-eastern portion of the farm Braamfontein. Quite a big stream flowed along the farm and they intended selling the water to the residents of Johannesburg. But there were also large quantities of clay, suitable for brickmaking, along the stream. The government decided that more <b>money</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> from issuing brick maker's licences at five shillings per month. The result was that many landless Dutch-speaking burghers (citizens) of the ZAR settled on the property and started making bricks. They also erected their shacks there. Soon the area was known either as Brickfields or Veldschoendorp. Soon other working poor, [...] "Malays, Coolies and Kaffirs" [...] also settled there. The government, who sought to differentiate the white working class from the black, laid out new suburbs for the Burghers, Indians, Coloureds and Africans, but the whole area simply stayed multiracial.|$|R
50|$|After the {{historic}} 1906 victory, the Liberal Party introduced multiple reforms on range of issues, including health insurance, unemployment insurance, and pensions for elderly workers, thereby {{laying the groundwork}} for the future British welfare state. Some proposals failed, such as licensing fewer pubs, or rolling back Conservative educational policies. The People's Budget of 1909, championed by David Lloyd George and fellow Liberal Winston Churchill, introduced unprecedented taxes on the wealthy in Britain and radical social welfare programmes to the country's policies. It was the first budget with the expressed intent of redistributing wealth among the public. It imposed increased taxes on luxuries, liquor, tobacco, high incomes, and land, - taxation that disproportionately affected the rich. The new <b>money</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> available for new welfare programmes as well as new battleships. In 1911 Lloyd George succeeded in putting through Parliament his National Insurance Act, making provision for sickness and invalidism, and this was followed by his Unemployment Insurance Act.|$|R

2500|$|The {{return to}} Belgium lasted {{less than two}} years.

2500|$|One social {{stereotype}} of a Yorkshireman {{had a tendency}} to include such accessories as a flat cap and a whippet; this alludes to rural life. While the stereotype might not always ring true, the county certainly has an illustrious rural history; many of the now prominent West Yorkshire cities grew {{thanks in part to the}} wool industry. Another {{stereotype of}}ten heard in connection with Yorkshire workers is the proverb [...] "where there's muck, there's brass"; this refers to the widely held view that where one is willing to do unpalatable work, there is plenty of <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In retaliation, the {{brothers}} created a documentary in 1976 called Inside Marilyn Chambers, which {{was composed of}} alternate shots and outtakes from Green Door and Eve, as well as interviews with some of her co-stars. This was done without Chambers' knowledge but when she learned of it just prior to its release, she negotiated a deal that would offer her 10% of the gross {{as long as she}} would contribute interviews to the film and promote it nationally. [...] "I hated the film and I still do", she said later. [...] "It's supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the story of my life, and it's not true. Jim and Art ripped me off. They felt I'd betrayed by them ... I felt they'd betrayed me, and for many years, we didn't speak. Only when <b>money</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> did we start talking again." [...] Chambers reunited with the Mitchell Brothers in 1979 for two 30-minute features called Beyond de Sade and Never a Tender Moment, which explored BDSM.

6000|$|... "I {{suppose he}} has the means," [...] said Mr. Masters, who was aware that if he told his wife a fib on the matter, she would learn the truth from his senior clerk, Mr. Samuel Nickem. Among the {{professional}} gifts which Mr. Masters possessed, had not been that great gift {{of being able to}} keep his office and his family distinct from each other. His wife always knew what was going on, and was very free with her advice; generally tendering it on that side on which <b>money</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made,</b> and doing so with much feminine darkness as to right or wrong. His clerk, Nickem, who was afflicted with no such darkness, but who ridiculed the idea of scruple in an attorney, often took part against him. It was the wish of his heart to get rid of Nickem; but Nickem would have carried business with him and gone over to some enemy, or, perhaps have set up in some irregular manner on his own bottom; and his wife would have given him no peace had he done so, for she regarded Nickem as the mainstay of the house.|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} to HUD {{focusing on the}} poor, Cisneros seized {{the goal of the}} Clinton administration to widen homeownership opportunities. [...] Under his command, HUD advanced a long way in expanding homeownership among the country's most under-represented groups — young adults, minorities and low- to moderate-income families. [...] When Cisneros arrived at HUD, the home ownership rate was 63.7 percent. When he left office in 1997 it had risen to 65.7 percent, its highest level since 1981. [...] Under policies set in place by Cisneros’ administration, at the end of Clinton's second term, homeownership continued its upward trend to 67.5 percent. [...] At the close of his term, Cisneros acknowledged that lower interest rates and a strong economy were primary factors for the increase. [...] However, the agency's ability to convince lenders, builders and real estate agents that there was <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> in selling housing to low- and moderate-income individuals played a significant role, he said.|$|E

[...] Referring to the rapid growth of crime in northern Kinta, Walker remarked:No wonder that the crime has increased, as increase it must, with a mining population of Chinese, a race that knows no repose, that settles only for the moment where <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> with the greatest ease, that would rob their best friends if they themselves should have lost their savings at the gaming table.Crime with such a population as this means progress, and although a check has <b>been</b> given <b>to</b> it by raising the Force to its utmost capacity, at the sacrifice of other parts of the state, strengthening the detective branch, and paying judiciously for information, crime must arise, and as long as a fair number of discoveries <b>are</b> <b>made</b> of crimes most difficult to detect in a country where escape is so easy, and a criminal can with comparative ease conceal himself, it is all that can be expected.|$|R
