40|$|AbstractMatrix {{metalloproteinase}} (MMP) {{degradation of}} extracellular matrix {{is thought to}} play an important role in invasion, angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis. Several studies have demonstrated that CD 147 / extracellular MMP inducer, a <b>membrane-spanning</b> <b>molecule</b> highly expressed in tumor cells, may be involved in the progression of malignancies by regulating expression of MMP in peritumoral stromal cells. In the present study we show that CD 147 is expressed in microvesicles derived from epithelial ovarian cancer cells and that CD 147 -positive vesicles may promote an angiogenic phenotype in endothelial cells in vitro. Vesicles shed by human ovarian carcinoma cell lines OVCAR 3, SKOV 3, and A 2780 expressed different levels of CD 147 and stimulated proangiogenic activities of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a CD 147 -dependent fashion (OVCAR 3 > SKOV 3 > A 2780). Moreover, vesicles shed by ovarian carcinoma cell line CABA I with low CD 147 expression had no significant effect on the development of angiogenic phenotype in HUVECs. The treatment of OVCAR 3 cells with small interfering RNA against CD 147 suppressed the angiogenic potential of OVCAR 3 -derived microvesicles. However, transfection of CD 147 cDNA into the CABA I cell line enabled CABA I-derived vesicles to induce angiogenesis and to promote MMP genes expression in HUVECs. We therefore conclude that vesicles shed by ovarian cancer cells may induce proangiogenic activities of HUVECs by a CD 147 -mediated mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The c-Met receptor, {{also known}} as the HGF receptor, {{is one of the most}} studied {{tyrosine}} kinase receptors, yet its biological functions and activation mechanisms are still not fully understood. c-Met has been implicated in embryonic development and organogenesis, in tissue remodelling homeostasis and repair and in cancer metastasis. These functions are indicative of the many cellular processes in which the receptor plays a role, including cell motility, scattering, survival and proliferation. In the context of malignancy, sustained activation of c-Met leads to a signalling cascade involving a multitude of kinases that initiate an invasive and metastatic program. Many proteins can affect the activation of c-Met, including a variety of other cell surface and <b>membrane-spanning</b> <b>molecules</b> or receptors. Some cell surface molecules share structural homology with the c-Met extracellular domain and can activate c-Met via clustering through this domain (e. g., plexins), whereas other receptor tyrosine kinases can enhance c-Met activation and signalling through intracellular signalling cascades (e. g., EGFR). In this review, we provide an overview of c-Met interactions and crosstalk with partner molecules and the functional consequences of these interactions on c-Met activation and downstream signalling, c-Met intracellular localization/recycling and c-Met degradation...|$|R

40|$|In {{order for}} cells {{to respond to}} their environment, a series of {{regulated}} molecular events has to take place. External signalling molecules bind to cellular receptors and thereby trigger the activation of multiple intracellular pathways, which modify cellular phenotypes. The cell-surface receptors {{for a wide range}} of polypeptide hormones possess protein tyrosine kinase activity, which is induced by binding of the appropriate extracellular ligand. Tyrosine phosphorylation can act as a molecular switch, by initiat ing the recruitment of cytoplasmic effector molecules con-taining Src homology (SH) 2 domains, to activated receptors. These SH 2 -containing proteins, in turn, regulate intracellular signalling pathways. Here, we discuss the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in triggering signalling pathways, as well as the functions of SH 2 domains, which mediate these events through phosphotyrosine-dependent protein-protein interactions. Key words: protein tyrosine kinase, signal transduction RECEPTOR PROTEIN TYROSINE KINASES Receptor protein tyrosine kinases (RPTKs) are <b>membrane-spanning</b> <b>molecules,</b> which function as regulators of cell growth and differentiation. RPTKs contain an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane element, and an intracellular catalytic region. The extracellular portion is char acterized by specific motifs such as cysteine-rich sequences, immunoglobulin-like loops, fibronectin repeats, and others, which are apparently involved in growth factor binding. The transmembrane domain is hydrophobic and plays a crucial role in receptor dimerization, while the intracellular region contains the tyrosine kinase domain and non-catalytic sequences that, following RPTK activation, serve as transphosphorylation su...|$|R

40|$|Maintaining {{asymmetric}} balances of intra- and extra-cellular ion concentrations {{is essential}} for the healthy and regular functioning of a cell as the presence of specific ionic gradients are responsible for a number of cellular and physiological processes. In order to establish and maintain these ionic gradients, ion channels provide one mechanism of controlled transport of physiological ions such as sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca 2 +) and chloride (Cl-) {{into and out of the}} cell. Natural ion channels are large and very complex proteins that are able to rapidly transport ions across the cell‟s bilayer membrane with high selectivity. In order to understand which structural characteristics are required for effective and selective ion transport, a range of macrocyclic compounds based on calix[4]arenes, oxacalix[3]arenes, pillar[5]arenes and diaza- 18 -crown- 6 was synthesised as models for channel-forming biomolecules. Through synthetic modifications and comparisons with their monomeric equivalents, it was possible to determine relationships between their structures and their activities. Polyether-based substituents, including an extended polyether, which incorporated a trans-but- 2 -ene linker, were attached in order to produce <b>membrane-spanning</b> <b>molecules.</b> The key elements investigated were the effect of the macrocycles compared to their monomeric equivalents, the effect of macrocyclic cavity size on ion selectivity, the effect on ion conductance observed between a rigid macrocycle compared with a flexible macrocycle and the impact of altering polyether chain length and functionality on ion conductance and selectivity. The compounds‟ ion transport abilities were assessed on artificial planar lipid bilayers and their antimicrobial activities determined by a variation of the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion test on the common pathogens: E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and S. pyogenes. Planar lipid bilayer results demonstrated that a predetermined structure, the length of the polyether substituent and the fit between the size of the macrocycle to the cation were important for transmembrane ion conduction; whereas the monomeric analogues formed unregulated sized pores leading to irregular to no activity and general non-selectivity. The rigid macrocycle compared to the flexible macrocycle demonstrated key differences in conduction where it is postulated that the flexible macrocycle conducted ionophorically. Antimicrobial tests revealed that the monomeric derivatives were significantly more potent towards bacteria than their macrocyclic equivalents, presumably due to the production of surfactant-like activity whilst the macrocyclic analogues displayed limited aqueous solubility...|$|R
40|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens {{virulence}} {{genes are}} induced by plant signals through the VirA-VirG two-component regulatory system. The VirA protein is a <b>membrane-spanning</b> sensor <b>molecule</b> that possesses an autophosphorylating activity, and the VirG protein is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein. In this report, we {{demonstrate that the}} VirG protein is phosphorylated by the VirA protein and that the phosphate is directly transferred from the phosphorylated VirA molecule (phosphohistidine) to the VirG protein. The chemical stability of the phospho-VirG bond suggested that the VirG protein was phosphorylated at the aspartate and/or glutamate residue. The phosphorylated VirG protein was reduced with tritiated sodium borohydride and subjected to proteolytic digestion with the Achromobacter protease I enzyme. The resulting peptide fragments were separated by C 8 reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, and the tritium-labeled peptide was sequenced. Amino acid sequence data showed that the aspartate residue at position 52 was the only site phosphorylated. Changing this aspartate into asparagine resulted in a nonphosphorylatable and biologically nonfunctional gene product. As a control, a randomly chosen aspartate was changed into an asparagine (position 72), and no effect on its phosphorylation or biological activity was observed. Unlike its homologs, including CheA-CheY, EnvZ-OmpR, and NtrB-NtrC, the phospho-VirG molecule was very stable in vitro. The possible implications of these observations and the function of VirG phosphorylation in vir gene activation are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Fractalkine/CX 3 C-chemokine ligand 1 is {{expressed}} as a <b>membrane-spanning</b> adhesion <b>molecule</b> that can be cleaved from the cell surface to produce a soluble chemoattractant. Within the vasculature, fractalkine {{is known to be}} generated by endothelial cells, but to date there are no reports describing its expression by smooth muscle cells (SMC). In this study we demonstrate that IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, but not IL- 1 beta, cooperate synergistically to induce fractalkine mRNA and protein expression In cultured aortic SMC. We also report the release of functional, soluble fractalkine from the membranes of stimulated SMC. This release is inhibited by the zinc metalloproteinase inhibitor batimastat, resulting in the accumulation of membrane-associated fractalkine on the SMC surface. Therefore, an SMC-derived metalloproteinase activity is involved in fractalkine shedding. While soluble fractalkine present in SMC-conditioned medium is capable of inducing calcium transients in cells expressing the fractalkine receptor (CX 3 CR 1), blocking experiments using neutralizing Abs reveal that it can be inactivated without affecting the chemotactic activity of SMC-conditioned media on monocytes. However, membrane-bound fractalkine {{plays a major role in}} promoting adhesion of monocytic cells to activated SMC. This fractalkine-mediated adhesion is further enhanced in the presence of batimastat, indicating that shedding of fractalkine from the cell surface down-regulates the adhesive properties of SMC. Hence, during vascular inflammation, the synergistic induction of fractalkine by IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha together with its metalloproteinase-mediated cleavage may finely control the recruitment of monocytes to SMC within the blood vessel wall...|$|R
40|$|Herpes simplex virus {{glycoprotein}} H (gH) {{is one of}} {{the four}} virion envelope proteins which are required for virus entry and for cell-cell fusion in a transient system. In this report, the role of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail domains of gH in membrane fusion was investigated by generating chimeric constructs in which these regions were replaced with analogous domains from other molecules and by introducing amino acid substitutions within the <b>membrane-spanning</b> sequence. gH <b>molecules</b> which lack the authentic transmembrane domain or cytoplasmic tail were unable to mediate cell-cell fusion when coexpressed with gB, gD, and gL and were unable to rescue the infectivity of a gH-null virus as efficiently as a wild-type gH molecule. Many amino acid substitutions of specific amino acid residues within the transmembrane domain also affected cell-cell fusion, in particular, those introduced at a conserved glycine residue. Some gH mutants that were impaired in cell-cell fusion were nevertheless able to rescue the infectivity of a gH-negative virus, but these pseudotyped virions entered cells more slowly than wild-type virions. These results indicate that the fusion event mediated by the coexpression of gHL, gB, and gD in cells shares common features with the fusion of the virus envelope with the plasma membrane, they point to a likely role for the membrane-spanning and cytoplasmic tail domains of gH in both processes, and they suggest that a conserved glycine residue in the membrane-spanning sequence is crucial for efficient fusion...|$|R
40|$|Dystroglycan (DG) is a {{ubiquitous}} <b>membrane-spanning</b> {{cell adhesion}} <b>molecule</b> and forms a crucial {{link between the}} extracellular matrix (ECM) and actin cytoskeleton. DG is composed of two proteins α- and β- DG which are encoded by a single gene. It was originally identified as the extracellular and transmembrane constituents of a large oligomeric complex of sarcolemmal proteins associated with dystrophin, the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene. Mutations {{of the components of}} this complex are associated with several forms of severe muscular dystrophies. DG is also expressed in the neuromuscular junction and non-muscle tissues such as brain, peripheral nerve, retina and kidney. With a broad expression pattern and multiple interacting proteins, DG is now thought to be important not only as a structural molecule but also as a cell signaling molecule, playing roles in cytoskeletal reorganization such as early development, myelinogenesis, synaptogenesis, epithelial morphogenesis and angiogenesis. Defective glycosylation of α-DG caused by mutations of several glycosyltransferases leads to the disruption of its linkage to the ECM. This aberrant glycosylation of α-DG is now considered as a universal pathogenic mechanism of neuromuscular diseases, especially congenital muscular dystrophies. Recently, we reported that the extracellular domain of β-DG is cleaved by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 2 and MMP- 9, raising a possibility of therapy for muscular dystrophy by blocking MMP activity. We also demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of extracellular α-DG (α-DG-N) is cleaved by a proprotein convertase and secreted into body fluid in the physiological state. These findings imply that the cleaved α-DG fragment may play an important biological role in various tissues. Here, we review the current understanding of diverging roles of DG and its implications in therapy for neuromuscular diseases...|$|R
