40|$|A single-distance phase {{retrieval}} {{technique was}} applied to the contrast-enhanced phase-sensitive imaging of <b>micro</b> <b>segregation</b> in die-cast aluminum alloy. Contrast between regions with and without <b>micro</b> <b>segregation,</b> spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio were evaluated to clearly differentiate micro segregations whose density difference from the matrix aluminum is small, making it difficult to visualize and differentiate them using ordinary absorption-contrast imaging. Since spatial resolution more or less drops during the phase retrieval process, a combination of the high-contrast phase-contrast imaging and the high-resolution absorption-contrast imaging {{was applied to}} reveal 3 D microstructure/fracture relationship in an in-situ tensile test. Each phase-contrast image was registered with a corresponding absorption-contrast image to examine the positional relationship between the fracture path and <b>micro</b> <b>segregation.</b> A sectioning technique was also applied to identify the source of density difference. The results confirmed that three-dimensionally connected bands of micro segregations provide a preferential path for fracture in the die-cast aluminum alloy investigated. The observations suggest that the control of the 3 D spatial distribution of <b>micro</b> <b>segregation</b> bands is of crucial importance for enhancing mechanical properties effectively even if its elimination is physically difficult...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAustenitic {{stainless}} steels are generally {{known to have}} very good laser weldability, when ordinary grades of sheets are concerned. But {{it is not necessarily}} the case, if special grades of fully austenitic structures with e. g. high molybdenum, or thick-section are used. It is also known that hot cracking susceptibility is strictly controlled by composition and welding parameters. If solidification is primary ferritic, hot cracking resistance is dramatically increased. It is also well known that laser welding needs a careful control of weld edge preparation and air gap between the edges. The dependence on edge quality can be decreased by using filler metal, either cold wire, hot wire or hybrid laser-arc welding. An additional role is high molybdenum contents where <b>micro</b> <b>segregation</b> can cause low local contents in weld which can decrease the corrosion properties, if filler metal is not used. Another feature in laser welding is its incomplete mixing, especially in thick section applications. It causes inhomogeneity, which can make uneven microstructure, as well as uneven mechanical and corrosion propertiesIn this presentation the features of laser welding of thick section austenitic {{stainless steels}} are highlighted. Thick section (up to 60 mm) can be made by multi-pass laser or laser hybrid welding. In addition to using filler metal, it requires careful joint figure planning, laser head planning, weld parameter planning, weld filler metal selection, non-destructive and destructive testing and metallography to guarantee high-quality welds in practice. In addition some tests with <b>micro</b> <b>segregation</b> is presented. Also some examples of incomplete mixing is presented...|$|E

In this paper, lower casting speed and a pulsed electric-magnetostatic compound field are used to refine microstructure and abate segregation in TRC 7075 sheet. The dendrite arm space decreases from 20 ¿m to 8 ¿ 13 ¿m and the micro-segregation degree of Mg, Zn and Cu decreases when casting speed decreases from 1. 5 m/min to 0. 75 m/min. The center macro-segregation belt disappears in the 0. 75 m/min sheet. The as-cast structure and the dendritic segregation in the 0. 75 m/min sheet are further refined and abated respectively by the compound field. The secondary dendrite arm size decreases to 5 ¿ 8 ¿m in the field sheet. The 0. 75 m/min sheet casted with the field shows better mechanical properties after homogenization and hot rolling.

40|$|Austenitic steels exhibiting {{twinning}} induced plasticity TWIP are {{materials with}} exceptional mechanical properties. In this work, {{the development of}} new grades of TWIP steels exhibiting corrosion resistance is presented. The alloy development was supported by thermodynamic and diffusion calculations within the FeMnCr CN alloy system. For the calculations ambient pressure and primary austenitic solidification were considered as necessary to avoid nitrogen degassing in all processing steps. Manganese is used as an austenite stabilizer, chromium to increase nitrogen solubility and provide corrosion resistance, while carbon and nitrogen provide mechanical strength. Diffusion calculations were used in order to predict the extent of <b>micro</b> <b>segregations</b> and additionally to evaluate the effect of diffusion annealing treatments. The material was cast in a laboratory scale with a nominal composition of Fe 20 Mn 12 Cr 0. 25 C 0. 3 N. Diffusion annealing was followed by hot rolling and solution annealing resulting in a fully austenitic microstructure. Tensile tests at room temperature were performed, exhibiting yield strengths of 430 amp; 8201;MPa and elongation to fracture of 93. In addition, not only the mechanical properties but also the weldability was studied, focussing on the characterization of the microstructure of bead on plate welds obtained by laser and TIG weldin...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} mechanisms {{responsible for}} both micro scale and macro scale compositional variations during cellular and dendritic solidification are discussed. It is shown that presently available models for cellular and dendritic growth in alloys predict only {{the elimination of}} macrosegregation during rapid solidification but that microsegregation still persists even in this regime. A simple model is proposed here to describe the complete elimination of microsegregation in the rapid solidification regime. A solid of ideally uniform composition can be produced with no <b>micro</b> or macro <b>segregation</b> at both very low large solidifation rates...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{comprehensive}} {{model is}} presented for the simulation of microstructure evolution during industrial solidification and homogenization processing of aluminum alloys. The model combines {{on the one}} hand <b>micro</b> <b>segregation</b> due to long-range diffusion during solidification and subsequent heat treatment with, on the other hand, precipitation in the primary A 1 phase. The thermodynamic data are directly obtained from a CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams) approach to thermodynamic equilibrium in multicomponent systems. The model is applied to the prediction of structure and segregation evolutions in a 3003 aluminum alloy for typical industrial solidification and homogenization sequences. It is shown that: (i) accounting for the nucleation undercooling of the eutectic/peritectic structures solidifying from the melt is essential to retrieval of the measured volume fractions of intergranular precipitates; (ii) calculations of intragranular precipitation ate generally not applicable if long-range diffusion is neglected; (iii) the precipitate-free zone can be quantitatively predicted only based on the coupling between intergranular and intragranular precipitation calculations...|$|E

30|$|Based {{on these}} data, Y may diffuse into the matrix {{material}} {{because of its}} high activity coefficient at 0.1 % addition, as it {{has the ability to}} fill in positions where defects are present. In this case, the partial paths for Cu to rush into the matrix are occupied and Cu atoms and dislocations are blocked at GBs. This strengthens GBs under the action of blocked Cu and undiffused Y. As a result, moving resistance of dislocation increases and the tensile strength of GBs is improved and so the broadened boundaries appear with the addition of Y. As the percentage of Y increases, the contents of undiffused Y at boundaries increase whilst simultaneously the inter-metallic compound AlCuY is formed and distributed at boundaries that obstructed Cu moving to matrix. The reticular θ phase is also reduced. This phenomenon results in a weakening effect of the matrix on absorbing Cu. Furthermore, the inter-metallic compound AlCuY segregated at multiple grain junctions causes <b>micro</b> <b>segregation,</b> which is a disadvantage of the properties of Al–Cu–Mn alloy. If the addition of RE Y increases continuously, tensile strength and fracture toughness would decrease and the tendency of ductile fractures also decrease.|$|E

40|$|A {{wide range}} of studies {{supports}} the assumption that levels of socio-spatial polarization, segregation, and exclusion are rising in global cities over the past decades as a direct outcome of certain global processes, such as the deindustrialization process, its associated changes in division of labor, and declined redistributive power of the welfare state. However, that assumption – known as the polarization thesis – is criticized based on several contentions, including the oversimplification of the global/local interplay by overlooking the role of local contingent factors that may modify, intensify, or reverse the expected socio-spatial outcome in individual cities. This study aims to capture the hybrid nature of the socio-spatial outcomes of global cities by proving that the complex process of restructuring of cities {{is a form of}} structural and chronological hybridity. Through providing a solid empirical ground for investigating the general applicability of the socio-spatial polarization thesis, as well as evaluating the influence of local contexts of cities on the outcomes of urban change. The research offers a theoretical review of the multifaceted restructuring of global cities. Then, the macro trends of global economy are linked to their <b>micro</b> outcomes (<b>segregation</b> patterns within cities), through understanding the implications of cities’ economic functions on local urban policies and housing markets. Finally, the changes in socioeconomic segregation over the past decades are calculated for a large dataset of 66 global cities. The collective result of the analysis shows the downfalls of the generalized hypothesis. While the discussion of individual cities highlights certain contextual particularities, that are contributing to the production of unique socio-spatial configurations in different global cities...|$|R
40|$|In {{industrial}} applications failures of mechanical parts made of carbon and alloyed steels may develop either during heat treatment steps or final finishing operations. Such failures have high impact costs for manufacturers, since heat treated steel products, in general, are high value products which {{increase in value}} with each step in the production process until the final life-cycle manufacturing steps are completed. This work highlights the selection of steels to avoid premature ruptures developing during either the heat treatment steps or finishing operations with emphasis {{on the role of}} banding in the failure process. Failure does not have to involve fracture but may simply imply a decrease in performance of surface treated components as consequence of surface properties, even in the presence of correct heat treatment parameters. The root causes for banding in steels, are described in literature, and banding has major effects on final product properties (and causal relationships). Therefore, the causes of banding are studied and classified. Conclusions suggest that microstructural defects such as (<b>micro)</b> <b>segregation</b> bands and other defects such as slag and oxides inclusions are developed in the early fabricating cycle steps and can cause premature failure of either semi-finished or finished products...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the effect of <b>micro</b> <b>segregation</b> of Nb, {{generated}} from the continuous casting on grain structure development during reheating and deformation. The amount of segregated material present in the microstructure has been quantified in the as-cast condition {{and that has been}} used to model grain size distribution after reheating and deformation which is required for subsequent toughness prediction in 0. 045 wt % Nb steel. The limits of validity of the original Dutta-Sellars model for predicting the amount of recrystallisation; investigating the influence of the variables such as starting grain size distribution, strain and Nb content has been examined. A modified Dutta-Sellars model considering the starting grain size distribution {{has been found to be}} more accurate in quantifying the amount of recrystallisation. This approach has been used to model grain size distribution after deformation both in the homogenised and in presence of Nb segregation. The effect of AlN, to replace Nb(C,N), on pinning the austenite grain boundaries during reheating has been investigated, as the segregation tendency of Al is much less compared with Nb.

40|$|Since {{it began}} {{recording}} statistics on “race”, gender and disability in 2000, the Employment Equity Commission has criticised the appointment {{patterns of the}} private sector. In this regard, their data suggest that private sector organisations are generally employing black people, women, and people with disabilities into professional, senior, and top management roles, at a very slow pace. This research took this factor as a starting place to begin to explore issues beyond the numbers but which may in part account for the very slow pace of recorded change. The research explored employment equity discourses and practices of empowerment and identity in a bank. Focusing on the headquarters of one major bank in Johannesburg, 55 managers were interviewed using in-depth semi-structured interviews. Sixteen participants submitted written personal reflections on a collection of extracts that {{they were asked to}} read and respond to. A discussion group of black participants was conducted. Publicly available documents on the organisations demographic profile were analysed. Lastly, nine naturalistic observation sessions were conducted {{to get a sense of}} social patterns of engagement across “race” and gender. These data sets were explored using a qualitative framework and critical discourse analysis to make meaning of the data. The findings suggest that discourses of merit have become pervasive and cast doubt on the competence of black professionals and managers. More senior professionals and managers believe that they are substantively empowered while those with less authoritative power see themselves as relatively less empowered – these patterns were largely “race” based. Women primarily identified as raced (black or white) and white female participants distanced themselves from employment equity whereas black female participants bore the stereotypes associated with employment equity. Patterns of social engagement indicate marked voluntary self-segregation by “race” and <b>micro</b> <b>segregation</b> patterns. This suggested little career advancement opportunities for those groups with less organisationally powerful social networks. Lastly, employment equity discourses and practices were key constituting factors in identity constructions of the sample of bank managers that were studied...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{development}} of tool steels and high-speed steels {{has led to}} a significant increase in alloy additions, such as Co, Cr, Mo, N, V, and W. Knowledge about the phase relations in these multicomponent alloys, that is, the relative stability between different carbides or the solubility of different elements in the carbides and in the matrix phase, is essential for understanding the behaviour of these alloys in heat treatments. This information is also the basis for improving the properties or designing new alloys by controlling the amount of alloying elements. Thermodynamic calculations together with a thermodynamic database is a very powerful and important tool for alloy development of new tool steels and high-speed steels. By thermodynamic calculations one can easily predict how different amounts of alloying elements influence on the stability of different phases. Phase fractions of the individual phases and the solubility of different elements in the phases can be predicted quickly. Thermodynamic calculations {{can also be used to}} find optimised processing temperatures, e. g. for different heat treatments. Combining thermodynamic calculations with kinetic modelling one can also predict the microstructure evolution in different processes such as solidification, dissolution heat treatments, carbide coarsening, and the important tempering step producing secondary carbides. The quality of predictions based on thermodynamic calculations directly depends on the accuracy of the thermodynamic database used. In the present work new experimental phase equilibria information, both in model alloys containing few elements and in commercial alloys, has been determined and was used to evaluate and improve the thermodynamic description. This new experimental investigation was necessary because important information concerning the different carbide systems in tool steels and high-speed steels were lacking. A new thermodynamic database for tool steels and high-speed steels, TOOL 05, has been developed within this thesis. With the new database it is possible to calculate thermodynamic properties and phase equilibria with high accuracy and good reliability. Compared with the previous thermodynamic description the improvements are significant. In addition the composition range of different alloying elements, where reliable results are obtained with the new thermodynamic database, have been widened significantly. As the available kinetic data did not always predict results in agreement with new experiments the database was modified in the present work. By coupling the new thermodynamic description with the new kinetic description accurate diffusion simulations can be performed for carbide coarsening, carbide dissolution and <b>micro</b> <b>segregation</b> during solidification.

40|$|Selective {{corrosion}} of type 316 L {{austenitic stainless}} steel welds during the production of organic acids resulted in losses in production due to unscheduled downtimes to perform repairs. Estimated corrosion rates of type 316 L filler material welds were {{an order of magnitude}} higher than that of the base material. Alternative higher alloyed commercial filler materials were evaluated under actual production conditions. The evaluated filler materials were types 316 L, 317 L, 309 L, 309 MoL, 2205, 2507, 625, 825 and 904 L. The effect of nitrogen on the corrosion properties of type 309 L filler material was evaluated by manipulating the nitrogen concentration of the shielding gas during MIG welding. These changes in nitrogen concentration did not influence the corrosion resistance of the type 309 L filler material. No correlation could be established between the corrosion rates, analysed chemical composition of the product and operating temperature during production. In almost all the cases where the chemical composition of the filler material was comparable with that of the base material the corrosion rates of the filler materials were higher than that base material. It might be expected that the ferrite phase with higher molybdenum and chromium should be more corrosion resistant while the austenite should be less resistant. This was, however, not the case with the corrosion of type 309 L filler material. It would thus appear that in this case nickel enrichment of the austenite phase had a larger influence on the corrosion resistance of the austenite phase than the chromium and molybdenum had on the corrosion resistance of the ferrite phase. It appears that nickel and molybdenum had the largest contribution to the corrosion resistance of stainless steels welds under these operating conditions. It is, however, believed that a certain minimum concentration of chromium is also required to provide corrosion resistance to these alloys in hot organic acid environments. In contrast with the fact that a substantial alloying content is required to improve corrosion resistance of the filler material, the small difference in composition between ferrite and austenite phases, due to <b>micro</b> <b>segregation,</b> appeared to affect the corrosion resistance on micro scale. This is illustrated by the micrographs, which show corrosion to etch out the dendrite structure. Since the morphology of the austenite and ferrite phases is so similar, it could not always be conclusively established which one of the two phases corroded selectively. Analyses performed on the austenite and ferrite phases did not indicate a concentration difference within the phases itself. However, there were significant differences in the concentration of elements between the phases, with the austenite stabilising elements reporting to the austenite phase and the ferrite stabilizing elements reporting to the ferrite phase, in line with thermodynamic predictions. In the case of the filler materials following the austenite mode of solidification, no significant concentration differences were detected within the matrix. Although all highly alloyed high nickel alloyed filler materials (types 904 L, 825 and 625) corroded at a lower rate than the type 316 L base material, type 625 filler material was the filler material of choice {{due to the lack of}} any pitting of the weld. Pitting was detected in both the 825 and 904 L filler materials. Galvanic corrosion was not noted at any of the weld/HAZ interfaces and in no case did the type 316 L parent metal adjacent to the weld corrode preferentially to the material further away from the weld.
