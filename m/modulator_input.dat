40|$|Abstract: In 1998, Sherman and Guillery {{proposed}} {{that there are}} two types of inputs to cortical neurons; drivers and modulators. These two forms of input are required to explain how, for example, sensory driven responses are controlled and modified by attention and other internally generated gating signals. One might imagine that driver signals are carried by fast ionotropic receptors, whereas modulators correspond to slower metabotropic receptors. Instead, we have proposed a novel mechanism by which both driver and <b>modulator</b> <b>inputs</b> could be carried by transmission through the same types of ionotropic receptors. In this scheme, the distinction between driver and <b>modulator</b> <b>inputs</b> is functional and changeable rather than anatomical and fixed. Driver inputs are carried by excitation and inhibition acting in a push-pull manner. This means that increases in excitation are accompanied by decreases in inhibition and vice versa. Modulators correspond to excitation and inhibition that covary so that they increase or decrease together. Theoretical and experimental work has shown that such an arrangement modulates the gain of a neuron, rather than driving it to respond. Constructing drivers and modulators in this manner allows individual excitatory synaptic inputs to play either role, and indeed to switch between roles, depending on how they are linked with inhibition...|$|R

40|$|The {{lateral geniculate nucleus}} is {{the best}} {{understood}} thalamic relay {{and serves as a}} model for all thalamic relays. Only 5 - 10 % of the input to geniculate relay cells derives from the retina, which is the driving input. The rest is modulatory and derives from local inhibitory inputs, descending inputs from layer 6 of the visual cortex, and ascending inputs from the brainstem. These modulatory inputs control many features of retinogeniculate transmission. One such feature is the response mode, burst or tonic, of relay cells, which relates to the attentional demands at the moment. This response mode depends on membrane potential, which is controlled effectively by the <b>modulator</b> <b>inputs.</b> The lateral geniculate nucleus is a first-order relay, because it relays subcortical (i. e. retinal) information to the cortex for the first time. By contrast, the other main thalamic relay of visual information, the pulvinar region, is largely a higher-order relay, since much of it relays information from layer 5 of one cortical area to another. All thalamic relays receive a layer- 6 modulatory input from cortex, but higher-order relays in addition receive a layer- 5 driver input. Corticocortical processing may involve these corticothalamocortical 're-entry' routes to a far greater extent than previously appreciated. If so, the thalamus sits at an indispensable position for the modulation of messages involved in corticocortical processing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{method for}} {{improving}} the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of sigma–delta modulators with one-bit quantization is pre-sented. The two-level feedback signal of a standard sigma–delta modulator {{is replaced by a}} multilevel signal, which is a superpo-sition of two parts. One part () represents a rough estimate of the instantaneous amplitude of the input signal (prediction signal), and the other () is the sign of the quantizer output, multiplied with constant. Compared to a nonadaptive modulator, the amplitude of () is reduced. Therefore, less noise power is in-troduced in the quantizer, and the SNR is considerably enhanced. Signal () is derived numerically from the quantizer output 0 () according to a particular adaptation algorithm. Except for the dc-level of (), sequence 0 () contains the full digital information of the <b>modulator</b> <b>input</b> signal. From 0 (), a digital multilevel sequence 0 () can be calculated, which represents the digital modulator output.
