5|$|Following his {{retirement}} from cricket in 1934, Hobbs {{continued to work}} as a journalist, first with Jack Ingham then with Jimmy Bolton as his ghostwriters. He accompanied the MCC team to Australia in 1936–37 and published four books which sold well in the 1930s. In addition, he produced two ghostwritten autobiographies, but generally avoided self-publicity or controversy. He continued to work at his sports shop and he and Ada moved home several times. By the mid-1930s, his wife was becoming <b>mentally</b> <b>and</b> physically frail. Hobbs supported several charities in his spare time and continued to play cricket at club and charity level.|$|E

5|$|Duane Roger Morrison (July 23, 1953 – September 27, 2006) was {{eventually}} {{identified as the}} perpetrator of the incident. He was unemployed {{at the time of}} the hostage crisis, and had no known connection to Platte Canyon High School or any of the hostages. Initial reports of the gunman described him as a bearded 35-year-old man with a camouflage backpack and a black hooded sweatshirt. Morrison had been imprisoned in 1973 for larceny and possession of marijuana, and was arrested on a separate occasion for obstructing police in Littleton, Colorado. Police announced that a suicide letter written by Morrison to a family member was being analyzed by the FBI. Morrison's family gave the letter to police, who then submitted the document to the FBI Behavioral Unit in Quantico, Virginia. In the 14-page letter, Morrison claimed that he was <b>mentally</b> <b>and</b> physically abused by his father as a child, and had suicidal thoughts since he was 21 years old.|$|E
5|$|Elephant Island, on {{the eastern}} limits of the South Shetland Islands, was remote from {{anywhere}} that the expedition had planned to go, and far beyond normal shipping routes. No relief ship would search for them there, {{and the likelihood of}} rescue from any other outside agency was equally negligible. The island was bleak and inhospitable, and its terrain devoid of vegetation, although it had fresh water, and a relative abundance of seals and penguins to provide food and fuel for immediate survival. The rigours of an Antarctic winter were fast approaching; the narrow shingle beach where they were camped was already being swept by almost continuous gales and blizzards, which destroyed one of the tents in their temporary camp, and knocked others flat. The pressures and hardships of the previous months were beginning to tell on the men, many of whom were in a run-down state both <b>mentally</b> <b>and</b> physically.|$|E
5|$|People of {{all ages}} with {{physical}} and mental disabilities obtain beneficial results from association with horses. Therapeutic riding is used to <b>mentally</b> <b>and</b> physically stimulate disabled persons and help them improve their lives through improved balance and coordination, increased self-confidence, and a greater feeling of freedom and independence. The benefits of equestrian activity {{for people with disabilities}} has also been recognized with the addition of equestrian events to the Paralympic Games and recognition of para-equestrian events by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI). Hippotherapy and therapeutic horseback riding are names for different physical, occupational, and speech therapy treatment strategies that utilize equine movement. In hippotherapy, a therapist uses the horse's movement to improve their patient's cognitive, coordination, balance, and fine motor skills, whereas therapeutic horseback riding uses specific riding skills.|$|E

5|$|Powers {{helped the}} police perform a sting operation, telling Seymour {{that the police}} knew what had {{happened}} and {{that the only way to}} save Williams was to dig up the gun and move it to somewhere more safe. When Seymour and Powers went to do this, several policemen (who had been lying in wait) immediately arrested her and Powers (who was released a few hours later). Seymour was in a poor condition both physically and <b>mentally,</b> <b>and</b> after a few hours she wrote and signed a statement which incriminated Williams. Powers again helped the police, convincing Williams to meet him at Moorgate station, where Williams was arrested by the police and charged with the murder of Arthur Walls. Williams maintained that he was innocent of the murder and burglary.|$|E
5|$|Presociality is when animals exhibit {{more than}} just sexual {{interactions}} {{with members of the}} same species, but fall short of qualifying as eusocial. That is, presocial animals can display communal living, cooperative care of young, or primitive division of reproductive labor, but they do not display all of the three essential traits of eusocial animals. Humans and some species of Callitrichidae (marmosets and tamarins) are unique among primates in their degree of cooperative care of young. Harry Harlow set up an experiment with rhesus monkeys, presocial primates, in 1958; the results from this study showed that social encounters are necessary in order for the young monkeys to develop both <b>mentally</b> <b>and</b> sexually.|$|E
5|$|Action T4 was a {{programme}} {{of systematic}} {{murder of the}} physically and mentally handicapped and patients in psychiatric hospitals that mainly took place from 1939 to 1941 and continued {{until the end of}} the war. Initially the victims were shot by the Einsatzgruppen and others; in addition gas chambers and gas vans using carbon monoxide were used by early 1940. Under the provisions of a law promulgated 14 July 1933, the Nazi regime carried out the compulsory sterilisation of over 400,000 individuals labelled as having hereditary defects. More than half the people sterilised were those considered mentally deficient, which included not only people who scored poorly on intelligence tests, but those who deviated from expected standards of behaviour regarding thrift, sexual behaviour and cleanliness. <b>Mentally</b> <b>and</b> physically ill people were also targeted. The majority of the victims came from disadvantaged groups such as prostitutes, the poor, the homeless and criminals. Other groups persecuted and killed included Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, social misfits and members of the political and religious opposition.|$|E

5|$|After the German {{invasion}} of Norway and Denmark, {{followed by a}} warning by the new Japanese naval attaché Captain Tadashi Meada that a German attack on the Netherlands was certain, {{it became clear to}} the Dutch military that staying out of the conflict might prove impossible. They started to fully prepare for war, both <b>mentally</b> <b>and</b> physically. Dutch border troops were put on greater alert. Reports of the presumed actions of a Fifth Column in Scandinavia caused widespread fears that the Netherlands too had been infiltrated by German agents assisted by traitors. Countermeasures were taken against a possible assault on airfields and ports. On 19 April a state of emergency was declared. However, most civilians still cherished the illusion that their country might be spared, an attitude that has since been described as a state of denial. The Dutch hoped that the restrained policy of the Entente and Central Powers during the First World War might be repeated and tried to avoid the attention of the Great Powers and a war in which they feared a loss of human life comparable to that of the previous conflict. On 10 April Britain and France repeated their request that the Dutch enter the war on their side, but were again refused.|$|E
5|$|Monroe's early {{childhood}} was stable and happy. While Gladys was <b>mentally</b> <b>and</b> financially unprepared for a child, {{she was able}} to place Monroe with foster parents Albert and Ida Bolender in the rural town of Hawthorne soon after the birth. They raised their foster children according to the principles of evangelical Christianity. At first, Gladys lived with the Bolenders and commuted to work in Los Angeles, until longer work shifts forced her to move back to the city in early 1927. She then began visiting her daughter on weekends, often taking her to the cinema and to sightsee in Los Angeles. Although the Bolenders wanted to adopt Monroe, by the summer of 1933, Gladys felt stable enough for Monroe to move in with her and bought a small house in Hollywood. They shared it with lodgers, actors George and Maude Atkinson and their daughter, Nellie. Some months later, in January 1934, Gladys had a mental breakdown and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. After several months in a rest home, she was committed to the Metropolitan State Hospital. She spent {{the rest of her life}} in and out of hospitals, and was rarely in contact with Monroe.|$|E
5|$|The NSDAP was a far-right {{political}} party which came {{into its own}} during the social and financial upheavals that occurred {{with the onset of}} the Great Depression in 1929. While in prison after the failed Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, Hitler wrote Mein Kampf, which laid out his plan for transforming German society into one based on race. The ideology of Nazism brought together elements of antisemitism, racial hygiene and eugenics and combined them with pan-Germanism and territorial expansionism with the goal of obtaining more Lebensraum for the Germanic people. The regime attempted to obtain this new territory by attacking Poland and the Soviet Union, intending to deport or kill the Jews and Slavs living there, who were viewed as being inferior to the Aryan master race and part of a Jewish Bolshevik conspiracy. The Nazi regime believed that only Germany could defeat the forces of Bolshevism and save humanity from world domination by International Jewry. Others deemed life unworthy of life by the Nazis included the <b>mentally</b> <b>and</b> physically disabled, Romani people, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses and social misfits.|$|E

5|$|The player {{needs to}} make moral {{decisions}} at certain points during the game, including making choices that can determine the fate of both soldiers and civilians. These decisions affect the relationship between Walker and his squadmates, and will cause them to react differently. The game has several subtle effects as the team starts being broken <b>mentally</b> <b>and</b> physically, including the degradation of their combat uniforms. Walker has visual and auditory hallucinations later into the game, and his executions of enemies become more violent. The orders and shouts to his team become increasingly angry and ragged in contrast to his original stern command voice. His kill confirmations of enemies corrupts from professional in the beginning to psychotic. Similarly, loading screens initially display helpful gameplay hints for the player, but as the game progresses, the text becomes increasingly hostile towards Walker's actions, and sometimes breaks the fourth wall by addressing the player directly. The game features collectibles known as Intel, which are audio logs that provide additional backstory for players.|$|E
