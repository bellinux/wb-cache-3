40|$|International audienceThe {{behavior}} of a shock wave generated by a hemispherical gaseous charge and propagating within a confined <b>multi-chamber</b> <b>system</b> is analyzed through the evolution {{of some of the}} shock parameters (maximum overpressure and positive impulse). Moreover, the impact of a variation in the volume of the rooms on the pressure history inside the building is also studied. Several small-scale experiments have been carried out using an adjustable model representative of a pyrotech-nic workshop. The experimental results show that the pressure histories are very complex. Yet, using a global approach, we were able to link the evolution of the arrival time of the shock wave within the building with the reference obtained in free field. New parameters were developed to best fit the experimental maximal overpressure in the cells and in the corridor leading to two predictive laws used to estimate the maximal overpressure in the model...|$|E

The initial preparation of the single crystal Ru(0001) surface (sample size 5  mm[*]×[*] 5  mm[*]×[*] 5  mm, delivered by Mateck) always included sputtering with 1.5  keV Ar+ ions (Ar purity of 99.999 %, delivered by Linde), the sample being held at 1100  K for continuous healing of the ion beam-induced damages of the crystalline structure of ruthenium. An undesired side effect of ion sputtering is the departure from the uniformly smooth surface if viewed at the micrometer scale. Then, the general specifics of the sample are the coexistence of extended atomically flat terraces with abrupt height changes of several dozen nanometers (essentially step-bunching areas). A previous photoelectron spectromicroscopy investigation has demonstrated a substantially faster oxidation kinetics of such step-bunching areas in comparison with atomically flat ones [21], later directly confirmed on the atomic scale by the STM technique [17].|$|E

Geochemical relationships of these amphibolites indicate the existence of a multiple fractionation process from a set of parental magmas, implying the existence of a <b>multi-chamber</b> <b>system</b> beneath the ridge where the basalt protolith was extruded. Neodymium isotopic ratios are typical of MORB, and oxygen isotopes indicate that these amphibolites have been derived from the uppermost part of the oceanic crust Thermal evolution, revealed from the study of chemical variations in the amphibole chemistry, is interpreted as resulting from subduction in a low-pressure regime in which the thermal structure of the continental hanging-wall played an important role. This continental wall was previously heated by subduction of a slab window resulting from migration of a triple junction along the continental edge during plate convergence. Three petrologic arguments support this tectonic model These are: (1) the low-pressure inverted metamorphic gradient of amphibolites of the oceanic domain; (2) the high-temperaturelow- pressure metamorphism of the continental hanging wall; (3) the early intrusion of boninites into the continental domain...|$|E

40|$|In this work, a {{new type}} of short water vapor {{treatment}} of the interface between the p- and i-layer is presented. This novel treatment is performed under vacuum below 1 mbar for 5 min and considerably reduces the i-layer boron contamination in amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) p-i-n solar cells prepared in single-chamber reactors. A significant advantage is that the substrate with the p-layer can remain loaded in the reactor during this oxidation treatment. The high effectiveness of this treatment in reducing the boron cross-contamination is directly supported by secondary ion mass spectroscopy measurements, by tracing the boron concentration depth profile across the p–i interface and by quantum efficiency measurements of the deposited cells. By applying this water vapor treatment, 0. 3 -μm-thick a-Si:H p-i-n solar cells of 1 cm 2 with high initial conversion efficiencies of 10. 1 % are deposited in a commercial large-area (35 × 45 cm 2) single-chamber PECVD KAI ™ reactor and can clearly compete with cells deposited in <b>multi-chamber</b> <b>systems.</b> Light soaking of these cells for 1200 h at 50 °C leads to stabilized efficiencies of 8. 2 %.

40|$|Recent basaltic-andesite lavas from Merapi volcano contain {{abundant}} and varied igneous inclusions suggesting a complex sub-volcanic magmatic system for Merapi volcano. In {{order to better}} understand the processes occurring beneath Merapi, we have studied this suite of inclusions by petrography, geochemistry and geobarometric calculations. The inclusions may be classified into four main suites: (1) highly crystalline basaltic-andesite inclusions, (2) co-magmatic enclaves, (3) plutonic crystalline inclusions and (4) amphibole megacrysts. Highly crystalline basaltic-andesite inclusions and co-magmatic enclaves typically display liquid–liquid relationships with their host rocks, indicating mixing and mingling of distinct magmas. Co-magmatic enclaves are basaltic in composition and occasionally display chilled margins, whereas highly crystalline basaltic-andesite inclusions usually lack chilling. Plutonic inclusions have variable grain sizes and occasionally possess crystal layering with a spectrum of compositions spanning from gabbro to diorite. Plagioclase, pyroxene and amphibole are the dominant phases present in both the inclusions and the host lavas. Mineral compositions of the inclusions largely overlap with compositions of minerals in recent and historic basaltic-andesites and the enclaves they contain, indicating a cognate or ‘antelithic’ nature for most of the plutonic inclusions. Many of the plutonic inclusions plot together with the host basaltic-andesites along fractional crystallisation trends from parental basalt to andesite compositions. Results for mineral geobarometry on the inclusions suggest a crystallisation history for the plutonic inclusions and the recent and historic Merapi magmas that spans the full depth of the crust, indicating a <b>multi-chamber</b> magma <b>system</b> with high amounts of semi-molten crystalline mush. There, crystallisation, crystal accumulation, magma mixing and mafic recharge take place.

This work describes {{the development of a}} new <b>multi-chamber</b> <b>system</b> designed for the continuous production of these tapes suitable for an industrial process. The system consists in three distinct vacuum chambers connected one with another by two specially designed 50 cm long slits. The length and cross-section of these slits have been calibrated in order to achieve a pressure difference up to 5 orders on magnitude across adjacent chamber. The system is originally conceived for the continuous production of CeO 2 buffered RABiTS Ni-based tapes that require a pre-treatment of the bare metallic tapes in forming gas, followed by CeO 2 deposition and a post-treatment in oxygen. To improve the robustness of the whole tape production process, we have designed and built a novel device based on a supersonic oxygen gas expansion for the continuous in situ oxygenation of YBCO during deposition. Here, we present preliminary results demonstrating the effectiveness of this device. Specifically, thanks to the enhancement of the number of collisions of the O 2 molecules with the substrate due to the focused supersonic beam, we find that the oxygen pressure in the vicinity of the substrate can be up to 3 orders of magnitude higher than the background pressure in the chamber. The main advantage of this supersonic device is the insensitivity of the effective pressure to the substrate-nozzle distance, in the 2 - 5 mm range, which can be easily controlled during a continuous production process...|$|E

In particular, the daily expression trend of two genes, one coding for a carbonic anhydrase and the other for a mitochondrial K+ channel, was highly correlated with the daily trend of transpiration rate, indicating that these genes are highly involved in the control of stomatal aperture in both genotypes. The daily trend of a putative ERECTA-like gene expression could be overlapped to the daily trend of water use efficiency of the two sorghum genotypes subjected to drought stress, enabling to promote this gene as marker for screening selection for water use efficiency trait in sorghum...|$|E

The effective development of these devices requires a solid understanding of their interconnected fluidics, to predict the transport of nutrients and waste through the constructs and improve the design accordingly. In this work, we focus on a specific model of bioreactor, with multiple input/outputs, aimed at generating osteochondral constructs, i. e., a biphasic construct in which one side is cartilaginous in nature, while the other is osseous.

Formation of GDP can be significantly reduced by the use of <b>multi-chamber</b> bag <b>systems.</b> Recent clinical studies have revealed increased dialysate levels of pro-collagen I C-terminal peptide (PICP) in patients dialyzed with these solutions. Here, we briefly review the current knowledge on various aspects of GDP toxicity toward peritoneal cells and analyze the impact of GDP on PICP release by human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMC) in vitro. MethodsHPMC were exposed to a mixture of known GDP added to culture medium at clinically relevant doses. After 12 days, the amount of PICP released was measured using an immunoassay. Furthermore, the protein synthesis was assessed by 3 H-proline incorporation in HPMC exposed to peritoneal effluent obtained from patients after three months of CAPD with either conventional PDF or low-GDP solution. ResultsExposure to GDP resulted in a significant decrease in PICP release by HPMC. In addition, the synthesis of new proteins secreted by HPMC was preserved significantly better in HPMC treated with effluent obtained when patients were dialyzed with low-GDP solutions rather than conventional PDF. ConclusionsExposure to GDP may impair protein synthesis and secretion by HPMC. Therefore, increased dialysate PICP levels in response to GDP-free PDF may be viewed as evidence of improved mesothelial cell function...|$|R
40|$|Analytical {{politics}} investigates collective decision-making {{in political}} systems. Such voting behavior in groups {{takes place in}} parliaments, committees or the board of local football clubs. It is a frequent object of study for theoretical as well as empirical analysis. Previous contributions have demonstrated well the stabilizing effect of procedural rules, such as agenda-setting or <b>multi-chamber</b> <b>systems,</b> for collective decisions. These rules are applied in many institutions, such as the European Parliament or the German Bundestag. Their main purpose is to ensure reliable policy. Previous work continually used the restrictive assumption of separable preferences. This assumption implies that different aspects of a question do not influence each other. The limited validity of this hypothesis is apparent even in everyday situations. For example, the enjoyment of a delicious meal depends on the combination of food and drink. When choosing between fish and venison for dinner {{you also have to}} consider the question of which sort of wine to have with the meal; white with fish, and red with venison. This form of interdependence also occurs in legislation. For example, the savings determined in the Greek budget influence the preferences of the German public for financial assistance to Greece. The assumption of separable preferences is therefore in the critical focus of theoretical research. This literature discusses the impacts of and solutions to nonseparable preferences in detail. The analysis suggests an increased complexity for every decision-making process affected by nonseparable preferences. This complexity leads to difficulties in the operationalization of nonseparable preferences {{and is one of the}} reasons that there are too few empirical examinations. In addition, the stabilizing properties of institutional arrangements identified under the assumption of separable preferences are in question. The goal of this study is to close this gap between theory and empiricism. I investigate nonseparable preferences by conducting a laboratory experiment, which allows comprehensive environmental control. This facilitates the operationalization of nonseparable preferences. First, I prove the relevance of nonseparable preferences for analytical research on social interaction. The experiment is therefore completed by empirical case studies. Next, I investigate the effects of nonseparable preferences on collective and individual decision-making in the laboratory. Finally, I assess my contribution with respect to current research in social science and discuss possibilities to more accurately model of human behavior. The dissertation is structured as follows. I start in chapter 1 with the presentation of my research question and design. In chapter 2 the concept of nonseparable preferences is further clarified by means of exemplary case studies. It also discusses the theoretical foundations of nonseparable preferences. My hypotheses are specified along common concepts used in the literature. Based on empirical data the relevance of nonseparable preferences for political science research is demonstrated in chapter 3. Next, chapter 4 presents the design of the laboratory experiment. The effects of nonseparable preferences on collective decision-making are examined in chapter 5. Subsequently, determinants for the motivation function of individuals are scrutinized in chapter 6. In chapter 7 I report the results of the post-experiment survey. All findings are evaluated in chapter 8, where I focus on detailing their usefulness to future research on human behavior.

40|$|Silicon {{is widely}} used in {{optoelectronic}} devices, including solar cells. In recent years new forms of silicon have become available, including amorphous, microcrystalline and nano-crystalline material. These new forms have great promise for low cost, thin film solar cells {{and the purpose of}} this work is to investigate their preparation and properties with a view to their future use in solar cells. A Hot Wire-Deposition Chemical Vapour Deposition CVD (HW-CVD) system was constructed to create a <b>multi-chamber</b> high vacuum <b>system</b> in combination with an existing Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition (PECVD) system; to study the amorphous to crystalline transition in silicon thin films. As the two chambers were linked by a common airlock, it was essential to construct a transfer mechanism to allow the transfer of the sample holder between the two systems. This was accomplished by the incorporation of two gate valves between the two chambers and the common airlock as well as a rail system and a magnetic drive that were designed to support the weight of, and to guide the sample holder through the system. The effect of different deposition conditions on the properties and structure of the material deposited in the combined HW-CVD:PECVD system were investigated. The conditions needed to obtain a range of materials, including amorphous, nano- and microcrystalline silicon films were determined and then successfully replicated. The structure of each material was analysed using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The presence of crystallites in the material was confirmed and the structure of the material detected by TEM was compared to the results obtained by Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectrum of each sample was decoupled into three components representing the amorphous, intermediate and crystalline phases. The Raman analysis revealed that the amorphous silicon thin film had a dominant amorphous phase with smaller contribution from the intermediate and crystalline phase. This result supported the findings of the TEM studies which showed some medium range order. Analysis of the Raman spectrum for samples deposited at increasing filament temperatures showed that the degree of order within the samples increased, with the evolution of the crystalline phase and decline of the amorphous phase. The Selected Area Diffraction (SAD) patterns obtained from the TEM were analysed to gain qualitative information regarding the change in crystallite size. These findings have been confirmed by the TEM micrograph measurements. The deposition regime where the transition from amorphous to microcrystalline silicon took place was examined by varying the deposition parameters of filament temperature, total pressure in the chamber, gas flow rate, deposition time and substrate temperature. The IR absorption spectrum for [mu]c-Si showed the typical peaks at 2100 cm- 1 and 626 cm- 1, of the stretching and wagging modes, respectively. The increase in the crystallinity of the thin films was consistent with the evolution of the 2100 cm- 1 band in IR, and the decreasing hydrogen content, as well as the shift of the wagging mode to lower wavenumber. IR spectroscopy {{has proven to be a}} sensitive technique for detecting the crystalline phase in the deposited material. Several devices were also constructed by depositing the [mu]c-Si thin films as the intrinsic layer in a solar cell, to obtain information on their characteristics. The p- layer (amorphous silicon) was deposited in the PECVD chamber, and the sample was then transferred under vacuum using the transport system to the HW-CVD chamber where the i-layer (microcrystalline silicon) was deposited. The sample holder was transferred back to the PECVD chamber where the n-layer (amorphous silicon) was deposited. The research presented in this thesis represents a preliminary investigation of the properties of [mu]c-Si thin films. Once the properties and optimum deposition characteristics for thin films are established, this research can form the basis for the optimization of a solar cell consisting of the most efficient combination of amorphous, nano- and microcrystalline materials...|$|R
40|$|Temperature {{programmed}} reduction/oxidation (TPR/TPO) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are {{two different}} fundamental techniques to acquire information on the oxidation state of metal oxide catalysts. In TPR experiments the consumption of hydrogen by a catalyst sample is measured {{as a function of}} the catalyst temperature. TPR works under ambient pressure, and the amount of hydrogen consumed can be correlated to the decrease of the oxidation state of the analyzed sample. In contrast to TPR, XPS analysis is performed under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions where the surface oxidation state can be obtained directly from the analysis of the shift of the core level binding energy for the particular metal atoms and by the deconvolution of the correspondent energy peaks using reference values for the binding energies at different oxidation states. Analyzing the large amount of literature data for supported vanadium oxide catalysts, in case of TPR, there is a certain confusion which oxidation state of vanadium should be assumed as the initial or final oxidation state. Some authors proposed V(V) as the initial oxidation state, but they partially observed H/V rations significantly less than 2 [1, 2, 3]. In contrast, in [4] there is assumed a reduction of V(V) to V(IV) for γ-Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2 supported catalysts and of V(V) to V(III) for SiO 2 supported catalysts. A reduction only to V(IV) was also proposed in [5]. In [6, 7] H/V ratios partially larger than 2 were reported, what would indicate the presence of V in oxidation state smaller than + 3. The only consensus is that vanadate species are more reactive with hydrogen than bulk-phase V 2 O 5. For XPS, similar discrepancies are reported, and in addition, the question of the stability of the sample composition under UHV conditions was not clarified up to now. Our latest results [8] show that the (usual) assumption of the VO x sample stability in UHV is generally saying not fulfilled. Using a <b>multi-chamber</b> UHV <b>system</b> (equipped with a PHOIBOS 150 hemispherical analyzer, SPECS), which allows a fast sample transfer (the first XPS spectrum can be obtained after less than 5 min only after the start of the evacuation of the load lock) we proved that a significant reduction of the sample can occur within first 15 - 20 min of exposition to UHV. Thus, some previous XPS results should be evaluated critically and there is still a need of new systematic investigations. The scope of this contribution is to perform such a systematic study comparing the results of TPR and XPS studies. For this purpose, several series of VO x catalysts supported on γ-Al 2 O 3, SiO 2 and TiO 2 with loadings up to 15 % V were prepared by impregnation of the supports with suspensions of VO(acac) 2 in acetone or V 2 O 5 in ammonia, water and acetone, followed by subsequent calcination at 650 °C under air for 8 h. Beside TPR/TPO and XPS the calcinated catalysts were characterized by XRD, BET, AAS and thermal analysis techniques to obtain additional information about the textural properties and the nature of the vanadyl species on the catalyst surface. Our results indicate, that the dispersion of V increases in the order TiO 2 2 2 O 3. The acetylacetonate route of catalyst preparation can yield a higher V dispersion than the inorganic route. XPS data show, that the oxidation state of the calcinated samples increases with the increased presence of the bulk V 2 O 5 phase, meaning below monolayer coverage, a significant part of vanadate is V(IV). Further, time resolved XPS measurements demonstrate that under vacuum conditions bulk-like V 2 O 5 is more reducible than the dispersed vanadate species. In contrast, at ambient pressure (during the TPR experiments), vanadate species are better reducible than V 2 O 5. Summarizing the results, four different reduction peaks (attributable to isolated, dimeric and polymeric vanadate and bulk-like V 2 O 5) can be clearly distinguished. In TPO experiments different types of curves for vanadite and bulk-like V 2 O 3 were observed. Performing TPR-TPO cycling experiments, it can be observed, that the distribution between the different V phases changes during the redox cycles, for low V loadings a new low temperature reduction peak appears (Fig. 1). The H/V ratio increases with increasing V loading and with decreased V dispersion. By subtraction of the H/V ratio form the XPS results it can be concluded, that the final oxidation state of V after TPR experiments is + 3 independent from the nature of V species, vanadate or V 2 O 5 (Fig. 2). In the TPR experiments, the deficit in hydrogen consumption for low loaded catalysts is clearly located on the oxidized side and should be attributed to the significant presence of V(IV) in the “fresh” samples and not to an incomplete reduction of V(V). In contrast to V 2 O 5, vanadate species do not undergo the full redox cycle between V(V) and V(III), a significant vanadate part remains at + 4 after re-oxidation (TPO).
