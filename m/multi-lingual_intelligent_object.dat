40|$|Wireless {{embedded}} modules {{have increasingly}} been implemented {{on a range}} of devices, becoming a standard inclusion in mobile technology, entertainment systems and gaming consoles. It will not be far off before they are introduced to household appliances and industrial devices. However, the key challenge is that each manufacturer implements a proprietary set of protocols and standards, and in addition, a set of management applications, which add an unnecessary overhead of compatibility issues and protocol inconsistencies. The aim of the project is to propose an <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Object</b> Framework (IOF), a new communication standard over a wireless network without the existing complexity of a multiple set of architectural solutions. The <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Object</b> Framework consists of a framework design that enables devices of different platforms to communicate by a common data exchange model via a device management controller. In this paper, a prototype of the <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Object</b> Framework is implemented based on Microsoft. NET framework. A substantial amount of research work is carried out to create IOF Management Studio, <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Objects</b> devices, system integration and testing.

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} differences between AI research and conventional computer science (such as software engineering and database technology) is that AI has its own established programming methodology. Rule-based programming has been dominant for AI research and applications. However, {{there are a number}} of inherent problems with existing rule-based programming systems and tools. Most notably, they are inefficient in structural representation, and rules in general lack software engineering devices to make them a viable choice for large programs. Many researchers have therefore started to integrate the rule-based paradigm with objectoriented programming, which has its strength in these areas. This paper establishes the concepts of knowledge <b>objects</b> and <b>intelligent</b> <b>objects</b> based on the integration of rules and objects, and outlines an on-going project of the authors' design along this direction.
