40|$|Recently, {{the cost}} for Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and the other {{distributed}} energy resources have become more affordable at the household level, especially photovoltaics (PV) and storage batteries. With this, the possibility of households to become “prosumers” (producers and consumers of energy at the same time) becomes an attractive alternative due to the opportunity to save on the electricity bill costs. The traditional concept where a household can only purchase from the grid becomes outdated; this also triggers the concern of “death spiral. ” The reinforcing loop where the increase of the prosumers can provoke them to defect from the grid and force the utilities to increase their tariffs in order to cover their network grid and additional policies cost. Where in the past, this kind of condition was unlikely to happen. Due to household consumers are usually the least elastic and ended up carrying {{the burden of the}} of the cost because this type of end user will not change their consumption by much, even if prices increase greatly (Alleman, 1999; Ramsey, 1927). This research is using Vensim software to build and run a model of the Spanish household market based on System Dynamics (SD) methodology. The model is using six different scenarios that tested into four kinds of combinations of policy: no net metering and <b>mixed</b> <b>tariff,</b> no net metering and volumetric tariffs, net metering and volumetric tariffs, and net metering with <b>mixed</b> <b>tariff.</b> On top of that, the possibility of exit charges and network-only regulation charges were also being tested on those four combinations of policy, to see about the potential possibility of the “death spiral” in the Spanish household market. Results indicated that there is less possibility for the “death spiral” happening in Spain’s household market. Interestingly, cost recovery aside the concept of net metering leads to less to none of the grid defection, and without net metering, it is encouraging households to defect from the grid. Other results are fixed-network regulation cost can dampen grid disconnection, {{but at the same time}} delayed the RES adoption, and exit charges managed to prevent grid defection. Other alternatives are needed to be explored in order to foster RES, efficient market mechanisms need to be designed in order to put in level playing field different technologies at different scales and not incentivizing certain technologies with non-transparent cost shifting among consumers as net-metering does.

40|$|By using a mixed duopoly model, {{this paper}} {{analyses}} {{the effects of}} domestic firm ownership status on foreign direct investment decisions. It is shown that, although public ownership {{can be understood as}} a protectionist device, foreign direct investment can only be an equilibrium strategy if the level of privatization of the domestic economy is high enough. Furthermore it is proved that foreign direct investment is harmful from a home welfare point of view. <b>Mixed</b> duopoly, <b>tariffs,</b> foreign direct investment,...|$|R

We use a simple model of contaminated goods trade to analyze the optimal <b>mix</b> of <b>tariffs</b> and inspections as means of controlling damage from this negative externality. Among other policy-relevant results, we find that (1) while it is always optimal to employ tariffs, there are non-trivial cases in which inspections should optimally be set to zero, (2) a higher infection rate requires a higher tariff, but beyond a point optimal inspections decrease in the infection rate, and finally (3) taking a dynamic view and considering future effects of current introductions leads unambiguously to more stringent inspections, but may give rise to higher or lower tariffs...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{competition in}} nonlinear <b>tariffs</b> when consumers <b>mix</b> two goods, and ask whether simple two-part tariffs or exclusivity can arise in equilibrium. Contrary {{to the existing}} literature, this happens only when consumer types are observable. If they are unobservable, then the equilibrium tariff has decreasing marginal prices even when goods are almost homogeneous, {{and a third of}} consumers always <b>mixes</b> goods. Two-part <b>tariffs</b> will never even arise as best responses to arbitrary <b>tariffs.</b> Exclusivity; <b>Mixing</b> goods; Nonlinear tariffs; Two-part tariffs...|$|R
50|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Vietnam {{is characterized by}} challenges and achievements. Among the achievements is {{a substantial increase in}} access to water supply and sanitation between 1990 and 2010,nearly universal metering, and increased investment in wastewater treatment since 2007. Among the challenges are continued widespread water pollution, poor service quality, low access to improved sanitationin rural areas, poor sustainability of rural water systems, insufficient cost recovery for urban sanitation, and the declining availability of foreign grant and soft loan funding as the Vietnamese economy grows and donors shift to loan financing. The government also promotes increased cost recovery through tariff revenues and has createdautonomous water utilities at the provincial level, but the policy has had <b>mixed</b> success as <b>tariff</b> levels remain low and some utilities have engaged in activities outside their mandate.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the economic impact}} on Austria of three possible new EU free trade agreements: (1) an EU-US agreement; (2) an EU-Canada agreement; and (3) an EUArmenia/Georgia/Moldova agreement. This is done with a computational model of the global economy. The trade agreements are modeled as a <b>mix</b> of preferential <b>tariff</b> reductions and reductions in non-tariff measures that affect both goods and services. The primary impact follows from NTM reduction rather than tariff reductions. Of the three agreements, a potential agreement with the US {{is by far the}} most important. This follows from the size of the US economy. The US accounts for roughly one-quarter of extra-EU Austrian exports. Overall, the combined impact of the FTAs studied is positive. Most of the impact follows from investment response. Productivity gains from NTM reduction mean a combination of increased national income, higher wages, and employment, and increased capital stocks for the Austrian economy...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} {{possible}} medium-term changes in EU trade policy, including the negotiation {{and implementation of}} Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with regional entities like ASEAN and the NAFTA countries. We also examine the possible conclusion of the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Such changes in policy at the regional and global level imply changes in trade policy and industrial structure that affect Austria {{as part of the}} network of European industry. To accomplish this, we work with a computable general equilibrium model (CGE) of the Austrian economy and its major global trading partners. This model is benchmarked to 2020 macroeconomic projections. The modeling scenarios are based on a <b>mix</b> of <b>tariff</b> reductions for goods and non-tariff barriers (NTB) reductions for services. The services liberalization scenario is based on protection with an “actionability” assumption. The results include estimated changes in GDP, welfare, {{as well as in the}} value added contained in Austrian exports. The focus on value added provides important insight to the overall impact on the Austrian economy. In all policy cases examined, the striking messages is the importance of high technology services (ICT and other business services) to the total growth in Austrian exports, on a value added basis. This reflects both the high value added content of trade in this sector, and the apparent comparative advantage of Austria in this sector in the 2020 baseline. trade agreements, ASEAN, NAFTA, Doha Round, Austria, CGE...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, one of {{the primary}} {{problems}} in the energy industry is ensuring rational operating conditions of electric power systems under variable loads and with regard to cost-effectiveness and technical capabilities of power plants. Supply fluctuated load considerably increases the costs in the power systems. The price of electricity in the case by changed load is generally higher than by constant load. This price cannot be decreased without cooperation with consumers. The last decade has shown an intensive adoption of new smart tools and technologies for automation in the electricity supply systems, which make it possible to increase the speed of receiving, transferring, processing and mapping the information, and to implement new capabilities of active behavior of consumers in managing their electricity demand on the basis of market mechanisms. The paper addresses a technique for the optimization of daily load curve for the case of a specified <b>tariff</b> <b>mix.</b> The genetic algorithms are used to apply the cost benefits. The usefulness of this method is illustrated by two case studies of energy-intensive manufacturing enterprises as active consumers and players on the energy market...|$|R
40|$|Service {{providers}} often offer {{tariff structures}} with several two-part tariffs that {{consist of a}} fixed fee and a usage price, such that consumers may pick the tariff they prefer. Prices of tariffs have significant impacts on service providers' profit, because they simultaneously influence consumers' tariff choices and their usage. The number of tariffs also plays an important role, because more tariffs segment the market better but also increase the administrative burden and require more marketing effort. This article presents a mixed-integer nonlinear programming optimization problem to determine profit-maximizing tariffs; compares several heuristic search methods, in particular, the gradient method, stochastic search, and simulated annealing, to solve this problem; analyses the profitability of different tariff structures; and outlines the factors that drive differences in profitability across various tariff structures. The results show that especially for large samples of more than 100 consumers, simulated annealing performs best and deviates only 0. 2 % from the optimum. Structures with fewer two-part tariffs are generally sufficient, because additional two-part tariffs only negligibly increase service providers' profit.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} optimal {{trade and}} privatization policies in a mixed duopoly {{in which a}} pubic home firm competes with a more efficient foreign firm. The home firm is a Cournot competitor or a Stackelberg leader. The home government chooses the degree of privatization and import tariff to maximize national welfare. The paper examines the policy effects on industry equilibrium with general demand and cost structures and shows that the optimal level of privatization depends crucially upon the strategic substitutability-complementarity assumption. It further shows that if both policies are used under linear demand and quadratic costs, the equilibrium prices, firms' outputs, welfare and tariff rates are the same under Cournot and Stackelberg competition, and price equals the home firm's marginal cost. Neither full nationalization nor full privatization is optimal under Cournot, but full nationalization is always optimal under Stackelberg competition. If only one policy is used, a reduction in government's ownership of the public firm under Cournot competition and constant marginal costs calls for a higher optimal tariff rate. This result does not carry over {{to the case of}} increasing marginal costs, although the optimal tariff is lower under full nationalization than under full privatization.
