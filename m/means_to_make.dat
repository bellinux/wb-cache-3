People that worked {{away from home for}} significant periods of time, such as woodcutters and shepherds, would bring bread and other foods with them (such as pancetta and salt cod) to hold them over. Acquacotta was prepared and used to marinate the stale bread, thus softening it.|$|E
5|$|Allocators {{were invented}} by Alexander Stepanov {{as part of}} the Standard Template Library (STL). They were {{originally}} intended as a <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the library more flexible and independent of the underlying memory model, allowing programmers to utilize custom pointer and reference types with the library. However, in the process of adopting STL into the C++ standard, the C++ standardization committee realized that a complete abstraction of the memory model would incur unacceptable performance penalties. To remedy this, the requirements of allocators were made more restrictive. As a result, the level of customization provided by allocators is more limited than was originally envisioned by Stepanov.|$|E

Fridtjof Nansen's endeavors raised the Norwegian public's consciousness of the Arctic, which again brought forth public support for annexation of Svalbard. Industrialization and permanent settlements on Svalbard began in the 1900s {{with the introduction of}} coal mining. This resulted in the need for jurisdiction. Firstly, there was no <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a mining claim legal. Secondly, there was a need for conflict resolution, particularly regarding labor conflicts, which often saw the mining company and the workers have different nationalities.|$|E

5|$|Going {{against the}} normal {{convention}} that the strongest characters {{should be the}} largest in terms of physical size, he designed many of Dragon Ball most powerful characters with small statures, including the protagonist, Goku. Toriyama later explained that he had Goku grow up as a <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> drawing fight scenes easier, even though his first editor Kazuhiko Torishima was initially against {{it because it was}} rare to have the main character of a manga series change drastically. When including fights in the manga, Toriyama had the characters go to uninhabited locations to avoid difficulties in drawing residents and destroyed buildings. Toriyama said that he did not plan the details of the story, resulting in strange occurrences and discrepancies later in the series, including changing the colors of the characters mid-story and few characters having screen tone because he found it difficult to use. Since the completion of Dragon Ball, Toriyama has continued to add to its story, mostly background information on its universe, through guidebooks published by Shueisha.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the U.S. Department of the Army {{contracted}} the botanist and bioethicist Arthur Galston, {{who discovered the}} defoliants later used in Agent Orange, and his employer University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana to {{study the effects of}} 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T on cereal grains (including rice) and broadleaf crops. Galston, then {{a graduate student at the}} University of Illinois, in his research and 1943 Ph.D. dissertation focused on finding a chemical <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> soybeans flower and fruit earlier. He discovered both that 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) would speed up the flowering of soybeans and that in higher concentrations it would defoliate the soybeans. From these studies arose the concept of using aerial applications of herbicides to destroy enemy crops to disrupt their food supply. In early 1945, the U.S. Army ran tests of various 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T mixtures at the Bushnell Army Airfield in Florida. As a result, the U.S. began a full-scale production of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and would have used it against Japan in 1946 during Operation Downfall if the war had continued.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not until}} the 1890s that the first modern {{legislative}} attempts to regulate minimum wages were seen in New Zealand and Australia.

The sweatshop owners were thought to have unfair bargaining power over their employees, and a minimum wage was proposed as a <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them pay fairly.

25|$|In How to Rock Climb, John Long {{notes that}} for {{moderately}} skilled climbers simply {{getting to the}} top of a route is not enough; how one gets to the top matters. In rock climbing, style refers to the method of ascending the cliff. There are three main styles of climbing: on-sight, flash, and redpoint. To on-sight a route is to ascend the wall without aid or any foreknowledge. It is considered the way to climb with the most style. Flashing is similar to on-sighting, except that the climber has previous information about the route including talking about the beta with other climbers. Redpointing <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a free ascent of the route after having first tried it.|$|E

Depending on the vessel's type and keel laid date, in accordance with the MSC256(84) standard they must have on board an emergency towing procedure manual. This ship-specific manual describes procedures that will allow the vessel to be towed using its own equipment. The procedure should make use of the standard mooring equipment like mooring ropes, bits, rollers and Panama chock.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, {{air power}} theorists like Giulio Douhet and Billy Mitchell claimed that air forces could win wars, obviating {{the need for}} land and sea fighting. It was thought that bombers would always get through {{and could not be}} resisted, {{particularly}} at night. Industry, seats of government, factories and communications could be destroyed, depriving an opponent of the <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> war. Bombing civilians would cause a collapse of morale and a loss of production in the remaining factories. Democracies, where public opinion was allowed, were thought particularly vulnerable. The RAF and the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) adopted much of this apocalyptic thinking. The policy of RAF Bomber Command became an attempt to achieve victory through the destruction of civilian will, communications and industry.|$|E
25|$|However recent {{molecular}} {{studies have}} shown a different arrangement. According to the molecular work on the nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA, the lesser kudu and the nyala are the basal most living species. Then around 10 million years ago {{there has been a}} split between forest-dwelling, gracile species and larger, open-plains species. This renders Tragelaphus paraphyletic in respect to Taurotragus, which either <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the latter genus into a junior synonym of the former genus or split Tragelaphus into several genera to maintain Taurotragus. In a 2011 large scale taxonomic study on ungulates by Groves and Grubb, they have found support of cryptic species and should be split into several distinct species. This was based on intensive morphological comparisons between the species (in particular the dimensions of the skull elements and skin colorarion) and defined species based on phylogenetic species concept. Groves and Grubb (2011) furthermore support in the establishment of several new genera in light of Tragelaphus being paraphyletic. Their taxonomy is concurrent with the molecular work, though they have a slight different arrangement among the species in Tragelaphus sensu stricto. Other scientists have mix reactions to this proposal, with some preferring the traditional number of species to be seven and others preferring the new taxonomy from Groves and Grubb (2011).|$|E
25|$|Since mid-2010, the Suns {{have been}} in a {{rebuilding}} mode. While the Suns did resign Amar'e Stoudemire in the 2010 free agency period with a 5-year contract for around $95 million, Stoudemire received $71 million guaranteed, {{with the rest of his}} salary coming only if certain conditions were held, such as getting guaranteed 4th and 5th season money if he remained healthy enough to meet those conditions. However, during the summer of 2010, the Suns let superstar Stoudemire go to the New York Knicks since they were guaranteeing him $100 million, and hired player agent Lon Babby as president of basketball operations. The team then paid over $80 million to acquire Hedo Türkoğlu, Josh Childress, and Hakim Warrick to not only replace Stoudemire, but also add bench depth. On August 5, 2010, the Suns also hired Lance Blanks to be their general manager as a <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> moves for their future while also competing during this period. On December 19, 2010, the Suns acquired Vince Carter, Mickaël Piétrus, and Marcin Gortat from the Orlando Magic, along with a low draft pick and cash considerations. For this acquisition, the Suns traded Jason Richardson, Earl Clark, and the recently acquired Hedo Türkoğlu. On February 24, 2011 the Suns acquired point guard Aaron Brooks, trading first round (Lottery Protected) draft pick and point guard Goran Dragić to the Houston Rockets.|$|E
