500|$|Throughout the season, O'Ree faced blatant racism from opponents, {{remarking}} [...] "people {{just wanted}} a piece of me, maybe because they thought I was different, so I had to defend myself. [...] I wasn't going to be run out of any rink." [...] He endured racial slurs from fans in each of Chicago, Detroit and New York, though the taunts were largely absent in Montreal and Toronto. [...] O'Ree was supported by his teammates and Boston fans. He stated [...] "they were <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in places like Detroit and New York, too. [...] But never in Boston. [...] I'll never forget how my teammates there took care of me â€” men like Johnny Bucyk, Doug Mohns, Charlie Burns and Don McKenney. [...] They accepted me totally. [...] All of them had class." [...] In 1961, O'Ree was traded to Montreal {{but was unable to}} crack the Canadiens' line-up. [...] Playing over 20 minor league seasons, O'Ree twice won the Western Hockey League's scoring title: in 1964, with the Los Angeles Blades, and in 1969, with the San Diego Gulls.|$|E
500|$|Idina Menzel, a Broadway veteran, {{was cast}} as Elsa. Menzel had {{formerly}} auditioned for Tangled, {{but did not}} get the part. However, Tangleds casting director, Jamie Sparer Roberts, preserved a recording of Menzel's performance on her iPhone, and on the basis of that, asked her to audition along with Bell for Frozen. Before they were officially cast, Menzel and Bell deeply impressed the directors and producers at an early table read; after reading the entire script out loud, they sang [...] "Wind Beneath My Wings" [...] together as a duet, since no music had been composed yet. Bell had suggested that idea when she visited Menzel at her California home to prepare together for the table read. The songwriters were also present for the table read; Anderson-Lopez said [...] "Lasseter was in heaven" [...] upon hearing Menzel and Bell sing in harmony, and from that moment forward, he insisted, [...] "Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel {{have to be in the}} movie!" [...] Lee said, [...] "They sung [...] it like sisters and what you <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> nd there wasn't a dry eye in the house after they sang." [...] Between December 2012 and June 2013, the casting of additional roles was announced, including Jonathan Groff as Kristoff, Alan Tudyk as the Duke of Weselton, Santino Fontana as Prince Hans, and Josh Gad as Olaf.|$|E
500|$|The fear in of {{the fourth}} floor refers to tetraphobia, the superstitious fear of the number four. Jokes about this have been {{featured}} in such pop culture works as the 1999 film Being John Malkovich and the NBC comedy series 30 Rock. The song [...] "Unskinny Bop", a 1990 single by the band Poison, plays {{during one of the}} strip club scenes. Leslie said Tom hides his emotions behind [...] "a very thick layer of Axe body spray", a reference to the real-life male grooming product. The Parks department employees eat at a restaurant called Jurassic Fork, a reference to the Steven Spielberg dinosaur adventure film Jurassic Park, which was adapted from a novel of the same name by Michael Crichton. During one scene, Tom refers to Ron as [...] "Rondoleezza Rice", a reference to former United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. At the strip club, Leslie mistakenly refers to a stripper named Sierra by the name Seabiscuit, a champion thoroughbred racehorse. Reflecting on his marriage, Tom said, [...] "At least we lasted longer than Avril Lavigne and that guy from Sum 41", a reference to the pop singer's short-lived marriage to Sum 41 guitarist Deryck Whibley. Tom says one of the strippers also works at Quiznos, a sandwich fast-food franchise; Tom says of her: [...] "She's really nice to me here, but really <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> at Quiznos." [...] Andy said he has a T-shirt that is [...] "literally priceless" [...] because he was wearing it when he tackled American singer Eddie Vedder. When Ron was commenting on how well Tom was pretending to be sad about his divorce, he tells Tom, [...] "Take it down a notch. You've already won your Oscar, DiCaprio," [...] which is a reference to the Academy Awards and the actor Leonardo DiCaprio.|$|E
