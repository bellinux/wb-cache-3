5|$|The {{following}} day, 24 September 1917, a British patrol {{reached the}} crash site. Documents in Voss' pocket identified him. A military doctor cursorily examined the corpse. He noted three bullet wounds. One ranged slightly upward through the chest cavity {{from right to}} left, consistent with Hoidge's angle of fire; it would have killed Voss {{in less than a}} minute. The other two gunshot wounds pierced Voss's abdomen from rear to front, coinciding with Rhys-Davids's firing angle. Werner Voss was buried like any other dead soldier near Plum Farm, laid in a shell crater without coffin or honors. His grave's location was recorded as <b>Map</b> <b>Sheet</b> 28, coordinates 24.C.8.3. The field grave would subsequently be lost trace of, through the turmoil of ongoing ground fighting.|$|E
25|$|To {{determine}} whether a specific <b>map</b> <b>sheet</b> forms part of a map series, it is often sufficient simply {{to search for a}} <b>map</b> <b>sheet</b> number. These numbers are usually printed prominently on the <b>map</b> <b>sheet,</b> and facilitates the identification of connecting sheets, either directly, or indirectly {{with the aid of a}} sheet index.|$|E

In addition, there are composition maps (i.e. extending over sheet borders) covering urban agglomerations, or tourist areas.

40|$|In {{the last}} 15 - 20 years when {{technology}} has entered into our lives, {{as in the}} other areas of engineering, {{it has become a}} necessity to utilize the conveniences and facilities provided by technology also in the area of cartography. Cadastral <b>map</b> <b>sheets</b> which were produced in earlier times need to be digitized in order {{to be used in the}} present day digital cadastre and the GIS(Geographic Information System) environment. However, the fact that the error limits which have been defined by the present regulations for digitizing old cadastral <b>map</b> <b>sheets</b> are low makes it difficult to use those <b>map</b> <b>sheets.</b> For this purpose, a regulation draft has been prepared in order to increase the usability of old cadastral <b>map</b> <b>sheets</b> in Turkey. In the present study, 4 cadastral <b>map</b> <b>sheets</b> of Konya/Turkey at a scale of 1 / 1000 were digitized and compared with land values and the coordinate differences were calculated. These coordinate differences were compared with the point position error limit values which were provided in the present regulation, in the regulation draft and which were obtained from the results of the implementation. It was observed that 48 % of the points in the old cadastral <b>map</b> <b>sheets</b> could be accepted when the error limits (maximum error) defined in the present regulation are taken int...|$|R

2500|$|According to subdivisions of the International Map of the World: The {{sheet numbers}} of the International Map of the World 1:1,000,000 are {{augmented}} in the next smaller scale by a suffix (e.g. capital letters). Sheet numbers of each further smaller scale will bear a different system of suffixes (e.g., Roman numerals, small letters, etc.). These numbers can become very complex, {{but at the same}} time allow [...] "the experts" [...] to gain at least a rough location of the <b>map</b> <b>sheet</b> on the globe. Example: Soviet General Staff map (1:200,000).|$|E
2500|$|Murray {{and others}} (1975) {{proposed}} that Mercury’s history could {{be divided into}} five periods: (1) accretion and differentiation, (2) “terminal heavy bombardment,” (3) formation of the Caloris basin (centered off <b>map</b> <b>sheet</b> at lat 30° N., long 195° U.S. Geological Survey, 1979), (4) filling of the large basins by “smooth plains,” and (5) a period of light impact cratering. Although these divisions have withstood well the assessments of subsequent investigators, they do not define a stratigraphy. Because the geologic map of the Bach region constitutes a synthesis of observation with interpretation, we shall explore several aspects of the region’s geologic development.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{fighting}} {{continued in the}} Truoi River and the Phu Loc sectors, the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines had begun to move into Huế city. In {{the early morning hours}} of January 31 after the rocket bombardment of the airfield and the initial attack on the Truoi River Bridge, Task Force X-Ray received reports of enemy strikes all along Highway 1 between the Hải Vân Pass and Huế. All told, the enemy hit some 18 targets from bridges, Combined Action units, and company defensive positions. With Company A, 1/1 Marines as the Phu Bai reserve, Colonel Hughes directed LtCol Gravel to stage the company for any contingency. At 06:30, Colonel Hughes ordered the company to reinforce the Truoi River Bridge. All Captain Batcheller recalled several years later was that [...] "we were rousted up about 04:00 on the 31st and launched south on trucks to rendezvous with and reinforce ARVN forces about a <b>map</b> <b>sheet</b> and a half south of Phu Bai." [...] The convoy was then turned around and sent towards Huế.|$|E
