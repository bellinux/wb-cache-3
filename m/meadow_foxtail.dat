25|$|Elements {{of concern}} to the area are fire, over- or under-grazing, native species reintroduction, human {{recreational}} (camping and hunting) and educational/scientific use, resource exploration, linear development, and invasive species. Invasive species, primarily weeds, are a significant threat that crowd out native plant species and reduce habitat and food sources for native animals, birds, fish, and insects. Weeds are quick colonizers that often move into an area disturbed by fire or human activity. Linear developments such as roads, pipelines, and powerlines often provide a vector for invasive species to enter new areas. Because of their rapid and opportunistic spread, weeds also often lack the deep root system of native plants and thus contribute to bank instability and soil erosion. The nodding thistle weed (Carduus nutans) was discovered {{in the area in}} 2006. Several other weed species have been found in the natural area, including the highly aggressive downy brome (Bromus tectorum), creeping <b>meadow</b> <b>foxtail</b> (Alopecurus arundinaceus), crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum), and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia). Several of these species have invaded from across the U.S. border into Canada. Formerly utilized as a reclamation species, crested wheatgrass has had detrimental effects on soil and grazing. Russian olive, imported as a soil stabilizer, windbreak, and ornamental, reduces biodiversity of riparian areas.|$|E

40|$|Harvesting meadows at early {{heading of}} the grasses yields large {{quantities}} of high quality forage but might {{in the long term}} cause the swards to deteriorate {{due to the lack of}} formation of mature seeds. We studied 4 cutting regimes on a <b>foxtail</b> <b>meadow</b> to define which would maintain the foxtail population naturally and is acceptable in terms of forage quality. The 1 st cut of the different cutting regimes was done either at early shooting, shooting, early heading or seed maturity of Alopecurus pratensis L [...] The 2 nd cut of the 3 first treatments was simultaneous to the 1 st cut of the 4 th treatment and was ground dried to allow the seeds to fall on the soil. When the meadow was harvested regularly at early heading of A. pratensis, its botanical composition deteriorated within 5 years and its yield decreased. With a 1 st cut at seed maturity, A. pratensis produced the most seeds and its proportion in the sward increased, but the forage had the lowest quality. In the treatments with the 1 st cut at early shooting or at shooting, A. pratensis produced significant quantities of seeds during the 2 nd regrowth, maintained its population and forage of intermediate quality was produced. Sustainable production of quality forage on intensive <b>foxtail</b> <b>meadows</b> might be achieved by periodically having the 1 st cut at shooting and using the second regrowth at seed maturity for ground dried hay...|$|R

30|$|Mean site fire {{interval}} (C 1) varied from 4.8 yr in one Jeffrey pine site (395) to 45.7 yr in the bristlecone pine site (Table 1). Across all Jeffrey pine sites, the average site interval was 10.9 yr. Using a Spearman rank correlation analysis, {{there was no}} significant (p < 0.05) correlation between site {{fire interval}} and elevation. Using a more restricted filter (C 10), the fire interval for fires scarring two or more trees varied from 8.9 yr at the 395 site (Jeffrey pine) to 38.7 yr at Cottonwood <b>Meadow</b> (lodgepole and <b>foxtail</b> pine). A C 10 fire return interval could not be calculated from the bristlecone pine samples because only one fire event was recorded in the same year on two or more trees.|$|R
