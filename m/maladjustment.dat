Spiegel stated that inferring the source of <b>maladjustment</b> from analyzing the shared variance between CSA and family environment does not answer the question of which variable explains <b>maladjustment</b> better; the authors answered that this statement shows a misunderstanding of the statistical procedure used their meta-analysis. Dallam, however, addressed the topic of several prior studies having found statistically significant relations between CSA and <b>maladjustment</b> even after controlling for family environment.|$|E

In his films for Warner Brothers' between 1937 and 1944, consistent themes were the conditions of working people, the portrayal of gangsters and racketeers, and opposition to fascism. After Dust Be My Destiny, written by Rossen and released in 1939, Frank Nugent, who regularly reviewed for The New York Times, complained about Warner Brothers' long line of melodramas about boys from poor neighbourhoods. Unlike filmmakers such as John Ford and Howard Hawks, Rossen was willing to explain his aims as a director: [...] "The element common to many of my films is the desire for success, ambition, which is an important element in American life. It is an important element, and has become increasingly more important in what is known as Western Civilization." [...] Polonsky commented that [...] "Rossen's talent is force applied everywhere without let-up." [...] Neve acknowledged that social concerns were central in most of Rossen's works, but commented that Lilith was different from Rossen's earlier films as it emphasized mood rather than narrative and examined through pictures and silences the nature of <b>maladjustment</b> and madness.|$|E

Traditionally, psychological problems come from the inner part of the clients.

500|$|An {{example of}} the low {{threshold}} {{is a point of}} Donetsk psychiatrist Valentine Pekhterev, who argues that psychiatrists speak of the necessity of adapting oneself to society, estimate the level of man's social functioning, his ability to adequately test the reality and so forth. In Pekhterev's words, these speeches hit point-blank on the dissidents and revolutionaries, because all of them are poorly functioning in society, are hardly adapting to it either initially or after increasing requirements. They turn their inability to adapt themselves to society into the view that the company breaks step and only they know how to help the company restructure itself. The dissidents regard the cases of personal <b>maladjustment</b> as a proof of public ill-being. The more such cases, the easier it is to present their personal ill-being [...] as public one. They bite the society's hand that feed them only because they are not given a right place in society. Unlike the dissidents, the psychiatrists destroy the hardly formed defense attitude in the dissidents by regarding [...] "public well-being" [...] as personal one. The psychiatrists extract teeth from the dissidents, stating that they should not bite the feeding hand of society only because the tiny group of the dissidents feel bad being at their place. The psychiatrists claim the need to treat not society but the dissidents and seek to improve society by preserving and improving the mental health of its members. After reading the book Institute of Fools by Viktor Nekipelov, Pekhterev concluded that allegations against the psychiatrists sounded from the lips of a negligible but vociferous part of inmates who when surfeiting themselves with cakes pretended to be sufferers.|$|E

The Director of Naval Gunnery was particularly pungent in his assessment of the design, [...] "The functions and requirements of carriers and of surface gun platforms are entirely incompatible ...the conceptions of these designs ...is evidently the result of an unresolved contest between a conscious acceptance of aircraft and a subconscious desire for a 1914 Fleet ...these abortions are the results of a psychological <b>maladjustment.</b> The necessary readjustments should result from a proper re-analysis of the whole question, what would be a balanced fleet in 1945, 1950 or 1955?"

2500|$|Carlo Santos of Anime News Network {{felt that}} the dead baby trope and pushover protagonists were {{overused}} by Tatsumi to elicit emotion. He also criticized the choice to flip the art. Santos concludes that [...] "although the stories hammer the same point over and over again, and seemingly with the same character each time, their brutal honesty and stark settings will be a refreshing change for readers who wonder {{whatever happened to the}} diversity of the [...] artform." [...] Tim O'Neil of PopMatters noted the dark and misanthropic themes in the stories, but said that Tatsumi distinguishes himself with the longer stories, especially [...] "Who Are You", because of their [...] "narrative lyricism" [...] and [...] "subjectivity". Grant Goodman of Comics Village felt that Tatsumi's characters were portrayed through his art rather than dialogue, saying of his stories: [...] "I cannot call any of them particularly excellent, but I do think that Tatsumi's style is refreshing and a welcome alternative to the style of current manga best-sellers." [...] Ng Suat Tong of the Hooded Utilitarian criticized the art, describing it as [...] "crude, inexperienced and laid down with the kind of haste which begets mistakes" [...] as well as the predictable misogyny in the stories and their linear structure, especially disliking [...] "Telescope". Daryl Surat of the Anime World Order podcast {{felt that the}} stories in the manga were a product of postwar Japan and difficult to identify with in a modern context, adding that the although the stories are similar, they are more concentrated due to their short length. In a starred review, Publishers Weekly compared the tone of the stories as [...] "between contemporary short fiction and EC Comics' old 'shock' comics", noting the theme of social <b>maladjustment</b> and complimenting Tatsumi's [...] "evocative settings" [...] and the flow of his stories. Andrew D. Arnold of Time complimented the naturalism of the stories and art, but disliked the misogyny present in the men's relationships, concluding that the collection [...] "feels as fresh and revelatory as when the works of Japanese cinema first began arriving in the U.S." [...] R.C. Baker of The Village Voice said that the manga's expressive art helped speak for its silent characters and that the subject matter distinguished itself from modern Japanese popular culture: [...] "A fearless spelunker of the id, Tatsumi delves beneath the button-down uniformity of Japan's legions of office drones." [...] Tom Rosin of Manga Life was reminded of kitchen sink films by the stories and called Tatsumi a [...] "master of the short story", saying that the manga [...] "is so unlike the Japanese comics we're accustomed to now, and such a strong example of his early work I find it slightly terrifying that this book only contains selections of his best comics from 1969!" [...] David Cozy of the Asahi Herald Tribune felt that manga was distinguished from literature with the eight-page limit—which forced Tatsumi to distill his stories and was appropriate for representing his [...] "characters' constricted lives"—as well as with the identifiable [...] "everyman" [...] in his art.|$|E

In the last decade such a change has come over the American mind as sometimes comes over a vigorous and wilful child. Suddenly it seems to have grown up, to have begun to weigh its powers and consider its possible deficiencies. There was a time when American confidence and self-satisfaction seemed impregnable; at the slightest qualm of doubt America took to violent rhetoric as a drunkard resorts to drink. Now the indictment I have drawn up harshly, bluntly and unflatteringly in Sec. 4 would receive the endorsement of American after American. The falling birth-rate of all the best elements in the State, the cankering effect of political corruption, the crumbling of independence and equality before the progressive aggregation of wealth--he has to face them, he cannot deny them. There has arisen a new literature, the literature of national self-examination, that seems destined to modify the American tradition profoundly. To me it seems to involve the hope and possibility of a conscious collective organisation of social life.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{complexity of}} modern aircraft creates {{a need for}} a larger number of caution and warning devices. But more alerts require more memorization and higher work loads for the pilot and tend to induce a higher probability of errors. Therefore, an architecture for a flight expert system (FLES) to assist pilots in monitoring, diagnosing and recovering from in-flight faults has been developed. A prototype of FLES has been implemented. A sensor simulation model was developed and employed to provide FLES with the airplane status information during the diagnostic process. The simulator is based partly on the Lockheed Advanced Concept System (ACS), a future generation airplane, and partly on the Boeing 737, an existing airplane. A distinction between two types of faults, <b>maladjustments</b> and malfunctions, has led us to take two approaches to fault diagnosis. These approaches are evident in two FLES subsystems: the flight phase monitor and the sensor interrupt handler. The specific problem addressed in these subsystems has been that of integrating information received from multiple sensors with domain knowledge in order to assess abnormal situations during airplane flight. This paper describes the reasons for handling malfunctions and <b>maladjustments</b> separately and the use of domain knowledge in the diagnosis of each...|$|R
