2500|$|Neer {{promoted}} {{the concept of}} three stages of rotator cuff disease. Stage I, according to Neer, occurred in those younger than 25 years and involved edema and hemorrhage of the tendon and bursa. Stage II involved tendinitis and fibrosis of the rotator cuff in 25- to 40-year-olds. Stage III involved tearing of the rotator cuff (partial or full thickness) and occurred in those older than 40 years. [...] For surgical purposes, tears are also described by location, size or area, and depth. Further subclasses include the acromiohumeral distance, acromial shape, fatty infiltration or degeneration of muscles, muscle atrophy, tendon retraction, vascular proliferation, chondroid metaplasia, and calcification. [...] Again, in surgical planning, age-related degeneration of thinning and disorientation of the collagen fibers, <b>myxoid</b> degeneration, and hyaline degeneration are considered.|$|E

Ganglion cysts also may develop independently from a joint.|$|E
50|$|<b>Myxoid</b> liposarcomas are {{the second}} most common type of liposarcoma, {{representing}} 30%-40% of all liposarcomas in the limbs; occurring most commonly in the legs, particularly the thigh, followed by the buttocks, retroperitoneum, trunk, ankle, proximal limb girdle, head and neck, and wrist. They occur in the intermuscular fascial planes or deep-seated areas. They present as a large, slow-growing, painless mass.|$|E
