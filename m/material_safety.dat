5|$|The Pipeline Hazardous <b>Material</b> <b>Safety</b> Administration (PHMSA) is {{responsible}} for developing and enforcing regulations for pipeline operation transportation having been created in 2004 within the United States Department of Transportation. In the months following the spill, {{they found that the}} in-line inspection tool used by Plains in Line 901 and Line 903 had miscalculated the degree of corrosion. The company also withheld in-line inspection data so “it could enhance its interpretation of the data,” according to a corrective order issued by PHMSA. In October, PHMSA proposed new rules to assist in preventing such inspection discrepancies.|$|E

25|$|According {{to their}} <b>material</b> <b>safety</b> data sheets, CFCs and HCFCs are colorless, volatile, toxic liquids and gases with a faintly sweet {{ethereal}} odor. Overexposure at concentrations of 11% or more may cause dizziness, loss of concentration, {{central nervous system}} depression and/or cardiac arrhythmia. Vapors displace air and can cause asphyxiation in confined spaces. Although non-flammable, their combustion products include hydrofluoric acid, and related species.|$|E
25|$|Oxalic acid in {{concentrated}} form {{can have}} harmful effects through contact and if ingested; manufacturers provide details in <b>Material</b> <b>Safety</b> Data Sheets (MSDS).

Symptoms and effects include a burning sensation, cough, wheezing, laryngitis, shortness of breath, spasm, inflammation and edema of the larynx, inflammation and edema of the bronchi, pneumonitis, pulmonary edema.|$|E
25|$|In {{externally}} decorated glassware the cadmium {{and lead}} content are limited, with lower concentrations permitted for the lip or rim region. Lead content is also restricted in ceramic ware with exterior decorations, booster cables, and safety pins in varying concentrations. In the case of safety pins the preliminary limit is 300ppm for 2012, but a much lower limit of 100 ppm will come into force in 2013. For the grips of hand tools the content of lead and certain phthalates are restricted. Various specific phthalates are also restricted in varying concentrations in notepads with vinyl coverings, purses, slippers, flip flops with rhinestones and similar plastic footwear, ear buds and headsets, and exercise/fitness mats. Restriction on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is defined for smoothing solution products, {{and in this case}} a specific warning is mandatory in the <b>material</b> <b>safety</b> data sheets if the product releases detectable amounts of formaldehyde.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{health and}} company {{officials}} have stated the chemical consumption {{is not known}} to be fatal, even if consumed in its purest form.

2500|$|The Bradley {{sustained}} damage {{when she was}} in a collision with the MV White Rose on the St. Clair River on April 3, 1957.

[...] The Bradley had two groundings while proceeding out of Cedarville, Michigan, one in the spring of 1958 and the other in November 1958. [...] These groundings were not reported to the U.S. Coast Guard. [...] The November grounding required repairs. [...] The U.S. Coast Guard investigation considered whether the groundings caused hull stresses that contributed to the Bradleys sinking. [...] The U.S. Coast Guard noted that although Bradley Transportation received an award for 2,228,775 injury-free man hours from April 24, 1955 to December 31, 1957 while operating the Bradley, the company's focus was industrial safety rather than <b>material</b> <b>safety</b> of the vessel.

2500|$|Section 8 of the Act covers {{reporting}} requirements. All employers must {{report to}} OSHA within eight hours if an employee dies from a work-related incident, {{or three or}} more employees are hospitalized {{as a result of}} a work-related incident. Additionally, all fatal on-the-job heart attacks must also be reported. Section 8 permits OSHA inspectors to enter, inspect and investigate, during regular working hours, any workplace covered by the Act. Employers must also communicate with employees about hazards in the workplace. By regulation, OSHA requires that employers keep a record of every non-consumer chemical product used in the workplace. Detailed technical bulletins called <b>material</b> <b>safety</b> data sheets (MSDSs) must be posted and available for employees to read and use to avoid chemical hazards. OSHA also requires employers to report on every injury or job-related illness requiring medical treatment (other than first aid) on OSHA Form 300, [...] "Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses" [...] (known as an [...] "OSHA Log" [...] or [...] "Form 300"). An annual summary is also required and must be posted for three months, and records must be kept for at least five years.|$|E
