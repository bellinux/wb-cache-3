5|$|Ruffin's and Leval's {{divisions}} fled {{towards the}} Laguna del Puerco, where Victor succeeded in halting their disorganised rout. The Marshal deployed {{two or three}} relatively unscathed battalions to cover the reorganisation of his forces and secure their retreat, but Graham had also managed to call his exhausted men to order and he brought them, with Duncan's artillery, against Victor's new position. Morale in the re-formed French ranks was fragile; when a squadron of KGL hussars rounded the Cerro and drove a squadron of French dragoons onto their infantry, the shock was too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> for the demoralised soldiers, who retreated in a sudden rush.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{a winning}} record, {{injuries}} hobbled {{the team for}} the 2009–2010 season. Reserves Batum and Fernández started the season on the inactive list and forward Travis Outlaw soon followed after a serious foot injury early in the season. Most notably, centers Oden and Joel Przybilla suffered season-ending knee injuries, while Roy and Aldridge played through shoulder, hamstring, ankle and knee injuries. Head Coach Nate McMillan was likewise not spared, suffering a ruptured Achilles tendon during practice and was in a walking boot. Because of the void at the center position, Blazers general manager Kevin Pritchard worked out a deal to acquire Marcus Camby from the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Steve Blake and Outlaw. Although wins did not come as easily as the season before, the Blazers rallied to finish at 50–32, and finished 6th in the West. Roy underwent surgery after suffering a torn meniscus in his right knee, but returned for Game 4 {{of the first round}} series against the Phoenix Suns. However, the accumulation of injuries was too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear,</b> and the short-handed Trail Blazers lost the series 4–2 to the Suns.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{high-profile}} baby rapes appeared since 2001 (including {{the fact that}} they required extensive reconstructive surgery to rebuild urinary, genital, abdominal, or tracheal systems). In 2001, a 9-month-old was raped and likely lost consciousness as the pain was too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear.</b> In February 2002, an 8-month-old infant was reportedly gang raped by four men. One has been charged. The infant has required extensive reconstructive surgery. The 8-month-old infant's injuries were so extensive, increased attention on prosecution has occurred.|$|E

500|$|Britain {{had very}} limited {{resources}} {{at the end}} of the war, but the British Zone was the most populated, most industrialised, and most devastated by Allied bombing, and therefore the most expensive for the occupier. The British government decided to reduce the cost by sharing the burden with the United States. Rainbow returned to London to work on this project, and was then sent to Washington, D.C., as part of the British negotiating team. She sailed on the , arriving in New York in November 1946. The Americans agreed to merge the U.S. and British zones into Bizonia, with the two nations sharing the costs equally. To deal with issues arising from the agreement, a small staff remained in Washington, and Rainbow was selected to be part of it. After spending Christmas in London, she flew to New York in January 1947. During her time in Washington, she had a desk at the Pentagon, and lived in a house on P Street which she shared with two other women from the British Embassy. She attempted to get the best possible deal for Britain; whenever possible, purchases were made in sterling, and shipping was with the Cunard Line. Eventually, the British government found even [...] half the cost of Bizonia too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear,</b> resulting in further negotiations. In 1949, she returned to England on the [...]|$|E
2500|$|Life for America's {{first black}} police {{officers}} was not easy. For Raiford, {{the tension and}} humiliation became too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear.</b> After a five-year tour of duty, Raiford traded his badge for a rundown schoolhouse for black children located in a remote area of Guilford County called Goodwill. A defunct book titled [...] "Hiawatha, the Warrior," [...] was compulsory reading {{for all of the}} first through twelfth graders he taught.|$|E
2500|$|The attacks hurt Stanton, and he {{considered}} resigning, but {{he remained in}} his position, at Lincoln's request. As defeats piled up, Lincoln sought to give some order to the disparate divisions of Union forces in Virginia. He decided to consolidate the commands of [...] Maj. Gens. McDowell, John C. Frémont, and Nathaniel P. Banks into the Army of Virginia, {{which was to be}} commanded by Maj. Gen. John Pope. Lincoln was also convinced that the North's army needed reform at the highest ranks; he and Stanton being the de facto commanders of Union forces had proved too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear,</b> so Lincoln would need a skilled commander. He chose Gen. Henry W. Halleck. Halleck arrived in Washington on July 22, and was confirmed as the general-in-chief of Union forces the following day.|$|E

60|$|The way he sank on {{the table}} in exhaustion, {{drinking}} his milk, his will, nevertheless, so perfect and unblemished, triumphant, though his body was broken and in anguish, was almost too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear.</b> My heart was wrung for my countryman, wrung till it bled.|$|E
60|$|When {{they finally}} went away we went up-stairs {{and he took}} his clothes off, and his legs were a picture to look at. They {{looked as if they}} were mailed all over with shirt buttons, each with a single red hole in the centre. The pain was intolerable--no, would have been intolerable, but the pain of the {{presence}} of those ladies had been so <b>much</b> harder <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> that the pain of the wasps' stings was quite pleasant and enjoyable by comparison.|$|R
60|$|It {{was almost}} too <b>much</b> {{happiness}} <b>to</b> <b>bear.</b> Oliver felt stunned and stupefied by the unexpected intelligence; he could not weep, or speak, or rest. He had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had passed, until, after a long ramble in the quiet evening air, a burst of tears came to his relief, {{and he seemed to}} awaken, all at once, to a full sense of the joyful change that had occurred, and the almost insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast.|$|R

60|$|This was too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> meekly. The boiling {{blood in}} the youth's heart boiled over into his face. He leaped forward, seized the donkey's rein with one hand, caught the man's left leg with the other, and hurled the rider {{backward}} to the ground.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him silently, still with the blank despair on her face; but then the tears began to fill her blue eyes, and her lip trembled. The strong man had had too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> that day. He let his head fall beside hers and sobbed.|$|E

60|$|They {{thought as}} little of Miss Pecksniff, while they greedily perused this letter, {{as if she}} were the very last person on earth whom it concerned. But Miss Pecksniff really had fainted away. The {{bitterness}} of her mortification; the bitterness of having summoned witnesses, and such witnesses, to behold it; the bitterness of knowing that the strong-minded women and the red-nosed daughters towered triumphant in this hour of their anticipated overthrow; was too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> be <b>borne.</b> Miss Pecksniff had fainted away in earnest.|$|R
6000|$|Pen {{looked at}} his early acquaintance,--who had been plucked, who had been rusticated, who had only, after {{repeated}} failures, learned {{to read and write}} correctly, and who, in spite of all these drawbacks, had attained the honour of a degree.

60|$|Why Tom {{should look}} troubled and turn grave all at once, {{she could n't}} understand, but she liked to see him stroke his mother's cheek so softly, as he stood with his head resting on the high back of her chair, for Polly fancied that he felt a man's pity for her weakness, and was {{learning}} a son's patient love for a mother who had had <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> with him.|$|E
60|$|Leo stood nearest to her, and {{the sight}} of this royal woman in her misery proved too <b>much</b> for him <b>to</b> <b>bear.</b> Stepping <b>to</b> her side he stooped and lifted her to her feet, muttering some kind words.

60|$|In the {{meantime}} {{the night was}} hideous with noises; musket shots, the sharp cracks of revolvers, shouts, cries, and at times the long shrill screams of women. It was too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> be <b>borne,</b> and feeling that for the present Saba's act had saved them, the boys, laying down their weapons, pressed their hands to their ears {{to keep out the}} din. There they sat for half an hour, stunned by the awful calamity, too horror-stricken at what had passed, and at the probable fate of their father, to find relief in tears.|$|R
40|$|Current risk-management {{practices}} {{are based on}} probabilities of extreme dollar losses (e. g., measures like Value at Risk), but these measures capture {{only part of the}} story. Any complete riskmanagement system must address two other important factors: prices and preferences. Together with probabilities, these comprise the three P’s of Total Risk Management. This article describes how the three P’s interact to determine sensible risk profiles for corporations and for individuals, guidelines for how <b>much</b> risk <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> and how <b>much</b> <b>to</b> hedge. By synthesizing existing research in economics, psychology, and decision sciences, and through an ambitious research agenda to extend this synthesis into other disciplines, a complete and systematic approach to rational decision making in an uncertain world is within reach...|$|R
