40|$|The {{pattern of}} hypoactivity that accompanies rapid weight gain {{following}} septal lesions in hamsters was characterized. Lesioned hamsters displayed reduced levels of running, shorter and slower running bouts, and longer pauses. We examined whether this hypoactivity {{was due to}} reassignment of <b>metabolic</b> <b>fuels</b> from supporting physical activity to anabolism, or due to reduced capacity of running to induce psychomotor arousal and mobilize <b>metabolic</b> <b>fuels.</b> Septal lesions were associated with increased rate of ponderal growth and higher titers of circulating growth hormone and insulin. No difference in concentrations of muscle and liver glycogen, percentage of body fat, or the capacity of muscle homogenates to oxidize substrates were identified. Lesioned hamsters ran as fast {{and as long as}} control animals on electrical-shock reinforced treadmill, but were unable to generate as much heat in response to injection (0. 8 mg/kg) of norepinephrine. We conclude that hypoactivity that accompanies rapid weight gain in hamsters results either from a reduced capacity of running to induce psychomotor arousal and provide incentives that normally motivate that behavior, or from a failure of running to mobilize <b>metabolic</b> <b>fuels</b> at a rate necessary to sustain normal running speed and duration, and not from reduced availability of <b>metabolic</b> <b>fuels</b> or reduced muscle capacity to oxidize metabolic substrates...|$|R

A cross sectional study was performed of 156 term infants and 62 preterm infants to establish the normal ranges and interrelationships of blood glucose and intermediary metabolites in the first postnatal week, and to compare these with those of 52 older children. Blood glucose concentrations varied more for preterm than for term infants (1. 5 - 12. 2 mmol/l v 1. 5 - 6. 2 mmol/l), and preterm infants had low ketone body concentrations, even at low blood glucose concentrations. Breast feeding of term infants and enteral feeding of preterm infants appeared to enhance ketogenic ability. Term infants had lower prefeed blood glucose concentrations than children but, like children, appeared to be capable of producing ketone bodies.

40|$|AbstractThe {{neuroendocrinology}} of ingestive {{behavior is}} a topic central to human health, {{particularly in light of}} the prevalence of obesity, eating disorders, and diabetes. The study of food intake in laboratory rats and mice has yielded some useful hypotheses, but there are still many gaps in our knowledge. Ingestive behavior is more complex than the consummatory act of eating, and decisions about when and how much to eat usually take place in the context of potential mating partners, competitors, predators, and environmental fluctuations that are not present in the laboratory. We emphasize appetitive behaviors, actions that bring animals in contact with a goal object, precede consummatory behaviors, and provide a window into motivation. Appetitive ingestive behaviors are under the control of neural circuits and neuropeptide systems that control appetitive sex behaviors and differ from those that control consummatory ingestive behaviors. Decreases in the availability of oxidizable <b>metabolic</b> <b>fuels</b> enhance the stimulatory effects of peripheral hormones on appetitive ingestive behavior and the inhibitory effects on appetitive sex behavior, putting a new twist on the notion of leptin, insulin, and ghrelin “resistance. ” The ratio of hormone concentrations to the availability of oxidizable <b>metabolic</b> <b>fuels</b> may generate a critical signal that schedules conflicting behaviors, e. g., mate searching vs. foraging, food hoarding vs. courtship, and fat accumulation vs. parental care.

40|$|The {{physiological}} {{mechanisms that}} control energy balance are reciprocally linked {{to those that}} control reproduction, and together, these mechanisms optimize reproductive success under fluctuating metabolic conditions. Thus, {{it is difficult to}} understand the physiology of energy balance without understanding its link to reproductive success. The metabolic sensory stimuli, hormonal mediators and modulators, and central neuropeptides that control reproduction also influence energy balance. In general, those that increase ingestive behavior inhibit reproductive processes, with a few exceptions. Reproductive processes, including the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) system and the mechanisms that control sex behavior are most proximally sensitive to the availability of oxidizable <b>metabolic</b> <b>fuels.</b> The role of hormones, such as insulin and leptin, are not understood, but there are two possible ways they might control food intake and reproduction. They either mediate the effects of energy metabolism on reproduction or they modulate the availability of <b>metabolic</b> <b>fuels</b> in the brain or periphery. This review examines the neural pathways from fuel detectors to the central effector system emphasizing the following points: first, metabolic stimuli can directly influence the effector systems independently from the hormones that bind to these central effector systems. For example, in some cases, excess energy storage in adipose tissue causes deficits in the pool of oxidizable fuels available for the reproductive system. Thus, in such cases, reproduction is inhibited despite a high body fat content and high plasma concentrations of hormones that are thought to stimulate reproductive processes. The deficit in fuels creates a primary sensory stimulus that is inhibitory to the reproductive system, despite high concentrations of hormones, such as insulin and leptin. Second, hormones might influence the centra...|$|R
