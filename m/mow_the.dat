5|$|The game {{does not}} go well for Homer, who is {{obviously}} still jealous of Ned. Meanwhile, Bart and Todd find out about an upcoming children's miniature golf tournament, with the first prize of $50. They enter it, and although Todd {{is very good at}} miniature golf, Homer becomes confident that Bart will win. He tells Bart that it is not okay to lose and forces him to stare angrily at a picture of Todd for 15 minutes every day. Later, when Bart looks at his meager collection of trophies in his room, Lisa offers to help him practice. Utilizing spiritual books that calm Bart's mind, they meditate. Meanwhile, Homer makes a bet with Ned on whose boy is a better golfer: the father of the boy who does not win the tournament will <b>mow</b> <b>the</b> other father's lawn in his wife's Sunday dress.|$|E

500|$|Narcissi {{are well}} suited for {{planting}} under small thickets of trees, {{where they can be}} grouped as 6–12 bulbs. They also grow well in perennial borders, especially in association with day lilies which begin to form their leaves as the narcissi flowers are fading. [...] A number of wild species and hybrids such as [...] "Dutch Master", [...] "Golden Harvest", [...] "Carlton", [...] "Kings Court" [...] and [...] "Yellow Sun" [...] naturalise well in lawns, but {{it is important not to}} <b>mow</b> <b>the</b> lawn till the leaves start to fade, since they are essential for nourishing the bulb for the next flowering season. Blue Scilla and Muscari which also naturalise well in lawns and flower at the same time as narcissus, make an attractive contrast to the yellow flowers of the latter. Unlike Tulips, narcissi bulbs are not attractive to rodents and are sometimes planted near tree roots in orchards to protect them.|$|E
500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Deep, Deep Trouble" [...] {{illustrates}} the things Bart raps {{about in the}} song, showing how he is forced by Homer to <b>mow</b> <b>the</b> lawn after throwing a buzzing alarm clock at his father in his sleep. When Homer tells Bart to hurry up, Bart accidentally runs over the sprinkler {{and as a result}} he has to stay at home when the family goes to see a boat show. After they leave, Bart decides to throw a party and invites his friends. They make a mess in the house and when Homer and Marge return home, Bart realizes he is in deep trouble. Joanne Ostrow of The Denver Post thought the video was not [...] "nearly as clever as the cartoon" [...] and that it had [...] "'promotional gimmick' written all over it." [...] "Then again, I never thought the video of the dance rap 'Do the Bartman' would be a ratings hit when it aired in December. So what do I know?", she added.|$|E
500|$|In the 1980s, {{to further}} {{his career as}} a filmmaker, Pierce moved to Carmel, California, where he met and befriended actor Clint Eastwood. Pierce shared a film {{treatment}} he had developed with Eastwood, who liked the story and helped Pierce develop it into Sudden Impact (1983), the fourth entry in Eastwood's Dirty Harry film series. Pierce was given a writer's credit for the story along with Joseph C. Stinson. Pierce is said to have written the phrase, [...] "Go ahead, make my day," [...] the film's most famous line, which went on to be identified as one of the ten best movie quotes of all-time by the American Film Institute. The phrase was inspired by something his father once told Pierce in his youth while encouraging his son to <b>mow</b> <b>the</b> lawn: [...] "When I come home tonight and the yard has not been mowed, you're going to make my day." [...] However, whether Pierce truly invented the phrase has been brought into question, since the same line was used in the action-drama film Vice Squad (1982) the previous year. Around this time, Pierce also directed Sacred Ground (1983), which was released the same year as Sudden Impact.|$|E

60|$|He {{glanced at}} me to see what I was {{thinking}} of him. I was thinking that {{he was afraid to}} meet her, and I was smiling to myself. Perhaps he felt ashamed, for he went silently away to the machine, where he belted his riding breeches tightly round his waist, and slung the scythe strap on his hip. I heard the clanging slur of the scythe stone as he whetted the blade. Then he strode off to <b>mow</b> <b>the</b> far bottom corner, where the ground was marshy, and the machine might not go, to bring down the lush green grass and the tall meadow sweet.|$|E
60|$|We went {{together}} {{down to the}} fields, he to <b>mow</b> <b>the</b> {{island of}} grass he had left standing the previous evening, I to sharpen the machine knife, to mow out the hedge-bottoms with the scythe, and to rake the swaths from {{the way of the}} machine when the unmown grass was reduced to a triangle. The cool, moist fragrance of the morning, the intentional stillness of everything, of the tall bluish trees, of the wet, frank flowers, of the trustful moths folded and unfolded in the fallen swaths, was a perfect medium of sympathy. The horses moved with a still dignity, obeying his commands. When they were harnessed, and the machine oiled, still he was loth to mar the perfect morning, but stood looking down the valley.|$|E

It was the resort of all the Irish haymakers who <b>mow</b> <b>the</b> broad fields in the neighborhood; and of drovers and teamsters who travel that road. Here would they gather in the endless summer twilight, or {{by the light of the}} harvest moon, and sit round a table at the door; and tipple, and laugh, and quarrel, and fight, and sing drowsy songs, and dawdle away the hours until the deep solemn notes of St. Paul's clock would warn the varlets home.|$|E
