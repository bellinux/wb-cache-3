5|$|The siege was the {{inspiration}} for the final scene in Alfred Hitchcock's original 1934 version of The <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> <b>Knew</b> Too Much; the whole story was heavily fictionalised in the 1960 film The Siege of Sidney Street. The siege was also the fictional inspiration for two novels, The Siege of Sidney Street (1960) by F Oughton and A Death Out of Season (1973) by Emanuel Litvinoff.|$|E
5|$|The boat chase {{was another}} scene that {{required}} very little CGI. Machine FX worked on replacing {{a few shots}} of visible stuntmen with a digital version of Craig's head, and recreated the boats Bond jumps over on his motorcycle {{to make it look}} more dangerous. Crowd creation was done for the Tosca scene by Machine FX, to make the performance look like it had sold out. Forster edited the opera scene to resemble The <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> <b>Knew</b> Too Much. In total, there are 900+ visual effects shots in Quantum of Solace.|$|E

5|$|The BSAC {{established}} two forts to the north-west of Algoa in 1900, then a boma at Feira in 1902, bringing Mashukulumbwe under Company control. Harrison Clark {{said that}} his concessions gave him authority over the area and demanded that the Company pay him for them. The BSAC said Clark's documents were illegal and refused to deal with him. It offered him compensation, the form of which differs by source; Brelsford and a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> Clark personally during the 1920s, Colonel NO Earl Spurr, {{say that he was}} given farms as compensation, while a 1920s business acquaintance, AM Bentley, writes that the Company promised grants of land and the right to reserve some mining claims. Clark reluctantly accepted the compensation when he realised that to challenge the BSAC he would have to travel a great distance, possibly to England, and invest heavily in a court case he would probably lose.|$|E

25|$|In October 1983, Rear Window and Vertigo {{were the}} first two films re-released by Hitchcock's estate after his death. These two films and three others– The <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> <b>Knew</b> Too Much (1956), The Trouble with Harry (1955), and Rope (1948)– had been kept out of {{distribution}} by Hitchcock since 1968. Cleaning and restoration were performed on each film when new 35mm prints were struck.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} films have {{depicted}} the underbelly {{of the city}} away from the familiar tourist sites. Examples of these include Up the Junction, Nil by Mouth, Dirty Pretty Things, Eastern Promises and two {{out of every three}} films directed by Mike Leigh. The East End meanwhile, was shown in The <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> <b>Knew</b> Too Much (1934), Waterloo Road (1944), It Always Rains on Sunday (1947) and A Kid for Two Farthings (1955), among others.|$|E
25|$|The Rabbis {{taught that}} Rahab {{was one of}} the four most {{beautiful}} women who ever lived, along with Sarah, Abigail, and Esther. The Rabbis taught that Rahab inspired lust by the mere mention of her name. Rabbi Isaac taught that saying Rahab's name twice would cause a man immediately to lose control. Rav Nachman protested that he said Rahab's name twice and nothing happened to him. Rabbi Isaac replied that he meant that this would happen to any <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> her.|$|E
25|$|Though Jayewardene indeed did {{not take}} {{measures}} to stop the attack on Tamils, he was not opposed to them personally, only politically. One of his most esteemed friends was a supreme court judge of Tamil ethnicity, {{a member of an}} elite family and raised in Colombo, but who was strongly linked to his Jaffna Tamil heritage. This is but one close Tamil friend of the president's, and it is quite clear that he was not a racist but rather a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> how to exploit racism to win the majority.|$|E

25|$|On 4 March 1995, {{an eight-year-old}} girl was {{abducted}} and sexually assaulted in the Langley Green area of Crawley. Whiting was arrested {{a few weeks}} later after a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> Whiting came forward after hearing that the abductor's car had been a red Ford Sierra, which matched the description of the car that Whiting had just sold. The vehicle was then traced by police to its new owner and a knife was found hidden in it; the victim had claimed that her abductor had told her he had a knife in his possession.|$|E
25|$|During {{debate over}} his nomination, Bork's video rental history was {{leaked to the}} press. His video rental history was unremarkable, and {{included}} such harmless titles as A Day at the Races, Ruthless People, and The <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> <b>Knew</b> Too Much. Writer Michael Dolan, who obtained {{a copy of the}} hand-written list of rentals, wrote about it for the Washington City Paper. Dolan justified accessing the list on the ground that Bork himself had stated that Americans only had such privacy rights as afforded them by direct legislation. The incident led to the enactment of the 1988 Video Privacy Protection Act.|$|E
25|$|In 1673 he was {{involved}} {{with the establishment of}} the Royal Mathematical School at Christ's Hospital, which was to train 40 boys annually in navigation, {{for the benefit of the}} Royal Navy and the English Merchant Navy. In 1675 he was appointed a Governor of Christ's Hospital and for many years he took a close interest in its affairs. Among his papers are two detailed memoranda on the administration of the school. In 1699, after the successful conclusion of a seven-year campaign to get the master of the Mathematical School replaced by a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> more about the sea, he was rewarded for his service as a Governor by being made a Freeman of the City of London.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{his seven}} decades in Hollywood, Stewart {{cultivated}} a versatile career and recognized screen image in such classics as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, The Mortal Storm, The Philadelphia Story, Harvey, It's a Wonderful Life, Shenandoah, The Glenn Miller Story, Rear Window, Rope, The <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> <b>Knew</b> Too Much, The Shop Around the Corner, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and Vertigo. He {{is the most}} represented leading actor on the AFI's 100 Years…100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) and AFI's 10 Top 10 lists. He is the most represented leading actor on the 100 Greatest Movies of All Time list presented by Entertainment Weekly. As of 2007, ten of his films have been inducted into the United States National Film Registry. As part of their 100 Years Series, Stewart was named the third-greatest screen legend actor in American film history by the AFI in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Even when storyboards were made, {{scenes that}} were shot {{differed}} from them significantly. Krohn's extensive {{analysis of the}} production of Hitchcock classics like Notorious reveals that Hitchcock was flexible enough to change a film's conception during its production. Another example Krohn notes is the American remake of The <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> <b>Knew</b> Too Much, whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule, something that, as Krohn notes, was not an uncommon occurrence on many of Hitchcock's films, including Strangers on a Train and Topaz. While Hitchcock did do {{a great deal of}} preparation for all his films, he was fully cognisant that the actual film-making process often deviated from the best-laid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines utilised during many other film productions.|$|E
500|$|In 1933 Alfred Hitchcock was set {{to direct}} a Bulldog Drummond film with a {{screenplay}} by Charles Bennett entitled Bulldog Drummond's Baby. The rights {{to the character of}} Drummond were then held by British International Pictures who would not sell the rights to use the character's for Bennett's screenplay. [...] Bennett and Hitchcock turned the film into The <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> <b>Knew</b> Too Much without Drummond.|$|E

[...] The New York Times said, [...] "Mr. Richards, now 66, writes with uncommon candor and immediacy.

500|$|A {{narrative}} relates that Sigrdrífa {{explains to}} Sigurd {{that there were}} two kings fighting one another. Odin had promised one of these—Hjalmgunnar—victory in battle, yet she had [...] "brought down" [...] Hjalmgunnar in battle. Odin pricked her with a sleeping-thorn in consequence, told her she would never again [...] "fight victoriously in battle", and condemned her to marriage. In response, Sigrdrífa told Odin she had sworn a great oath that she would never wed a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> fear. Sigurd asks Sigrdrífa to share with him her wisdom of all worlds. The poem continues in verse, where Sigrdrífa provides Sigurd with knowledge in inscribing runes, mystic wisdom, and prophecy.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "The <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> <b>Knew</b> Too Much", Castiel tricks Crowley and Raphael, {{eventually}} {{absorbing the}} souls from Purgatory.

While talking to Dean, who unsuccessfully begs him {{to give up the}} power, Sam sneaks up behind them and attempts to kill him with an angelic blade by stabbing Castiel in the back, but it has no effect. Castiel removes the blade, explains that he is no longer an angel, declaring himself their new God. He then glances at the three hunters before delivering an ultimatum: to profess their own loyalty and love unto him, or be destroyed.|$|E
