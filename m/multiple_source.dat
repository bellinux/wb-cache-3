It ships with an enhanced set of UI widgets, both for Windows Forms and WPF. It {{also includes a}} multithreaded build engine (MSBuild) to compile <b>multiple</b> <b>source</b> files (and build the executable file) in a project across multiple threads simultaneously. It also includes support for compiling icon resources in PNG format, introduced in Windows Vista. An updated XML Schema designer was released separately some time {{after the release of}} Visual Studio 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the ArcGIS suite, Esri {{had focused}} its {{software}} {{development on the}} command line Arc/INFO workstation program and several Graphical User Interface-based products such as the ArcView GIS 3.x desktop program. [...] Other Esri products included MapObjects, a programming library for developers, and ArcSDE as a relational database management system. [...] The various products had branched out into <b>multiple</b> <b>source</b> trees and did not integrate well with one another. [...] In January 1997, Esri decided to revamp its GIS software platform, creating a single integrated software architecture.|$|E
2500|$|According to textual scholars, {{the biblical}} {{regulations}} covering Yom Kippur are spliced together from <b>multiple</b> <b>source</b> texts, {{as indicated by}} evidence such as with the duplication of the confession over the bullock, and the incongruity in one verse stating that the high priest should not enter the Holy of Holies (with the inference that there are exceptions for certain explicitly identified festivals), and the next verse indicating that they can enter whenever they wish (as long as a specific ritual is carried out first). Although Rashi {{tried to find a}} harmonistic explanation for this incongruity, the Leviticus Rabbah maintains that it was indeed the case that the high priest could enter at any time if these rituals were carried out. Textual scholars argue that the ritual is composed from three sources, and a couple of redactional additions: ...|$|E
