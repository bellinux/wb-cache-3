40|$|Micromanipulators and <b>micropositioners</b> {{are used}} to {{manipulate}} movement of minute objects under a microscope. Existing systems mainly use piezoceramics, ball-screw based devices, and compliant mechanisms to map macro motion into microns. Flexure joints are compliant mechanisms that cost less to produce than piezoceramics. Also, they do not generate friction and backlash as in turning a screw. This thesis was based upon another idea where flexural notch joints were arranged with intercepting rotational axes. This means the axes were not separated by an offset distance. As a result, joints did not produce rotational offset. By integrating with a parallelogram model, a novel three degrees of freedom (DOF) system, actuated by motors, was developed. Kinematics and finite element results showed it should produce the required three translational DOF. However, experimental results showed that certain test cases did not generate pure translations.

40|$|Piezoelectric tube {{actuators}} are extensively used in {{scanning probe}} microscopes to provide dynamic scanning motions in open-loop operations. Furthermore, they are employed as micropositioners {{due to their}} high bandwidth, high resolution and ease of excitation. However, these piezoelectric micropositioners exhibit badly damped vibrations that occur when the input excites the dynamic response, which tends to degrade positioning accuracy and performance. This paper deals with vibrations’ feedforward control of a multi-degrees of freedom (DOF) piezoelectric <b>micropositioner</b> in order to damp the vibrations in the direct axes and to reduce the cross-couplings. The novelty in this paper relative to the existing vibrations feedforward controls is the simplicity in design approach, the minimal number of shaper impulses for each input required to damp all modes of vibration at each output, and the account for the strong cross-couplings which only occur in multi-DOF cases. A generalization to a multiple degrees of freedom actuator is first proposed.

40|$|The {{advancement}} of the technology of magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) greatly hinges on the optimization of the magnetic materials, fabrication process, and annealing conditions which involve characterization {{of a large number}} of samples. As such, it is of paramount importance to have a rapid-turnaround characterization method since the characterization process can take even longer time than the fabrication. Conventionally, <b>micropositioners</b> and probe tips are manually operated to perform 4 -point electrical measurement on each individual device which is a time-consuming, low-throughput process. A commercial automatic probe card analyzer can provide high turnaround; however, it is expensive and involves much cost and labor to install and maintain the equipment. In view of this, we have developed a novel low-cost, home-made, high-throughput probe card analyzer system for characterization of MTJs.

40|$|The {{temperature}} and/or entropy of electrically polarisable {{materials can}} be altered by changing electric field E. Research into this electrocaloric (EC) effect has focussed on increasing {{the size of the}} EC effects, with the long-term aim of building a cooler with an EC material at its heart. Materials and experimental methods are briefly reviewed. A ‘resetting’ indirect route to isothermal entropy change ∆S for hysteretic first-order transitions is described. An indirect route to adiabatic temperature change ∆T, without the need for field-resolved heat capacity data, is also described. Three temperature controllers were built: a cryogenic probe for 77 - 420 K with ∼ 5 mK resolution, a high-temperature stage with vacuum enclosure for 295 - 700 K with ∼ 15 mK resolution, and a low-temperature stage for 120 - 400 K with electrical access via <b>micropositioners.</b> Automation enables dense datasets to be compiled. Single crystals of inorganic salts (NH 4) 2 SO 4, KNO 3 and NaNO 2 were obtained. Applying 380 kV cm− 1 across (NH 4) 2 SO 4, it was found that |∆S| ∼ 20 J K− 1 kg− 1 and |∆T | ∼ 4 K, using the indirect method near the Curie temperature TC = 223 K. Without the ‘resetting’ indirect method, |∆S| ∼ 45 J K− 1 kg− 1 would have been spuriously found. Preliminary indirect measurements on KNO 3 and NaNO 2 give |∆S| ∼ 75 J K− 1 kg− 1 for ∆E ∼ 31 kV cm− 1 near TC = 400 K and |∆S| ∼ 14 J K− 1 kg− 1 for ∆E ∼ 15 kV cm− 1 near TC = 435 K, respectively. A cation-ordered PbSc 0. 5 Ta 0. 5 O 3 ceramic showing a nominally first-order transition at 295 K was obtained. The Clausius-Clapeyron phase diagram is revealed via indirect measurements where |∆S| ∼ 3. 25 J K− 1 kg− 1 and |∆T | ∼ 2 K, and direct measurements where |∆T | ∼ 2 K. Clamped samples show broadening of the field-induced transition. Epitaxial, ∼ 64 nm-thick SrTiO 3 films were grown by pulsed laser deposition on NdGaO 3 (001) substrates with a La 0. 67 Sr 0. 33 MnO 3 bottom electrode. The indirect method gives |∆S| ∼ 8 J K− 1 kg− 1 and |∆T | ∼ 3. 5 K near 180 K with |∆E| = 780 kV cm− 1.
