5|$|Jarvis {{planned to}} produce sequels, but the North American video game crash of 1983 halted most video game {{production}} {{for a few}} years. Prior to the full effects of the crash, Vid Kidz developed an official sequel, Blaster in 1983. The game {{is set in the}} same universe and takes place in 2085 in a world overrun by Robotrons. Williams considered creating a proper sequel in the mid-1980s as well as a movie adaptation. The company released a sequel with 3D graphics titled Robotron X in 1996 for the Sony PlayStation and personal computers. It was ported two years later to the Nintendo 64 as Robotron 64. In addition to the graphical update, the game includes new audio and multiple camera angles. Though the game features similar gameplay as the original, it was not as well received. Authors Andrew Rollings and Ernest Adams considered the <b>moving</b> <b>camera</b> in the 3D environment a negative update. They felt the original format—an overhead perspective of a single screen—presented the player with all the necessary information and relied on the player's skill. The <b>moving</b> <b>camera</b> angle, however, obscured areas of the playing field and could result in the player being shot by an enemy that suddenly appeared. Vince echoed similar statements, stating that the gameplay suffered from the loss of important aspects from the original. Rollings and Adams, however, attribute the fad of classic video game remakes in the late 1990s in part to Robotron Xs release.|$|E
25|$|The first {{attempts}} to bring platform games into 3D used 2D graphics and an isometric perspective. These games are nearly {{as old as}} the genre itself, one of the earliest examples being Sega's Congo Bongo in 1983. The first platformers to simulate a 3D perspective and <b>moving</b> <b>camera</b> emerged in the early-mid-1980s. An early example of this was Konami's platform game Antarctic Adventure, where the player controls a penguin in a forward-scrolling third-person perspective while having to jump over pits and obstacles. Originally released in 1983 for the MSX computer, it was subsequently ported to various platforms the following year, including an arcade version, NES, and ColecoVision. That same year, I, Robot, though not a platformer, featured filled 3D polygonal graphics, flat shading, and camera control options, which were not widely adopted by platformers until the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The game's {{environment}} {{takes up}} 60–65% of the CPU bandwidth, {{primarily because of}} the <b>moving</b> <b>camera,</b> but also because eight different characters can appear on screen at any one time – a large number for the technology of the time. Because of this, a powerful CPU was required to run the game, since the engine relied on the processor doing all the work in creating the 3D models. However, despite this limitation, the game runs at a minimum of 15 FPS, even on slow systems. The downside to this was that, since processor power at that time was limited, the in-game 3D models tended to look very pixelated, especially up-close and when motionless, due to the low amount of voxels used to display them. However, had the number of voxels been raised to increase the detail on the characters, the game would have become too slow to play, even on advanced CPUs.|$|E

In the past tracking has either {{been done with}} multiple static cameras, or single and stereo dynamic cameras. We register several <b>moving</b> <b>cameras</b> using a given 3 D model from Structure from Motion (SfM), and initialize the tracking given the regis-tration. The camera uncertainty estimate can be efficiently incorporated into a flow-network formulation for tracking.

30|$|One {{promising}} {{extension of}} gait recognition {{is to use}} inputs from multiple or <b>moving</b> <b>cameras.</b> Personal authentication systems at building entrances, for example, can use multiple cameras installed in appropriate positions to increase their authentication accuracy (such as “biometric tunnels” [13]). Similarly, <b>moving</b> <b>cameras</b> (e.g., cameras installed on drones) are expected to provide a novel type of security that can actively detect people behaving suspiciously by capturing pedestrians from different viewpoints, leveraging the recent developments in vision-based tracking [14]. In both cases, designating effective camera positions for gait recognition is required to maximize performance.|$|R

40|$|In most {{conventional}} systems for new viewpoint video synthesis of a moving object, calibrated multiple fixed cameras are used. Field {{of view of}} every camera must cover all {{the area in which}} the object moves. If the area is large, object size in the captured images and also in the new viewpoint video will become very small. In this paper, we propose a novel method to synthesize new viewpoint video of a moving object in natural scene, which is captured by uncalibrated <b>moving</b> <b>cameras.</b> During capture, cameras can be moved and zoomed to capture only part of a scene where there is a moving object. Projective Grid Space (PGS) which is 3 D space defined by two cameras is used for object’s shape reconstruction. We use SIFT for finding corresponding points in natural scene for registering <b>moving</b> <b>cameras</b> to PGS. In the experiment which is performed for demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method, new viewpoint video is successfully synthesized from multiple <b>moving</b> <b>cameras</b> without manual operation. 1...|$|R

500|$|While {{the film}} portrays {{the reality of}} the protagonist's {{experience}} in an expressionistic style, the glamour of Hollywood is portrayed more objectively. In reversing these conventional expectations, however, the film invites the viewer to interpret this version of Hollywood as merely [...] "the material of dreams" [...] and [...] "an unreal paradise of cruelty and failure", according to Taves. Scenes on the streets of Hollywood are filmed with a wildly <b>moving</b> <b>camera</b> from tilted angles, and edited into rapid juxtapositions, to reflect the false and excessive nature of the Hollywood film industry. The protagonist's ascension to heaven {{at the end of the}} film serves simultaneously as a fitting conclusion to the story, and as a satire of Hollywood's desire for traditional happy endings. As he ascends, heaven is located in the opposite direction from Hollywood, another jab at the industry. James wrote that the vision of heaven as an escape from the film industry's brutality [...] "figures the avant-garde's recurrent utopian aspirations".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a general approach to dynamic scene reconstruction from multiple <b>moving</b> <b>cameras</b> without prior knowledge or limiting {{constraints on the}} scene structure, appearance, or illumination. Existing techniques for dynamic scene reconstruction from multiple wide-baseline camera views primarily focus on accurate reconstruction in controlled environments, where the cameras are fixed and calibrated and background is known. These approaches are not robust for general dynamic scenes captured with sparse <b>moving</b> <b>cameras.</b> Previous approaches for outdoor dynamic scene reconstruction assume prior knowledge of the static background appearance and structure. The primary contributions of this paper are twofold: an automatic method for initial coarse dynamic scene segmentation and reconstruction without prior knowledge of background appearance or structure; and a general robust approach for joint segmentation refinement and dense reconstruction of dynamic scenes from multiple wide-baseline static or <b>moving</b> <b>cameras.</b> Evaluation is performed {{on a variety of}} indoor and outdoor scenes with cluttered backgrounds and multiple dynamic non-rigid objects such as people. Comparison with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrates improved accuracy in both multiple view segmentation and dense reconstruction. The proposed approach also eliminates the requirement for prior knowledge of scene structure and appearance...|$|R
30|$|Gait is an {{important}} biometric trait for identifying individuals. The use of inputs from multiple or <b>moving</b> <b>cameras</b> offers a promising extension of gait recognition methods. Personal authentication systems at building entrances, for example, can utilize multiple cameras installed at appropriate positions to increase their authentication accuracy. In such cases, {{it is important to}} identify effective camera positions to maximize gait recognition performance, but it is not yet clear how different viewpoints affect recognition performance. This study determines the relationship between viewpoint and gait recognition performance to construct standards for selecting an appropriate view for gait recognition using multiple or <b>moving</b> <b>cameras.</b> We evaluate the gait features generated from 3 D pedestrian shapes to visualize the directional characteristics of recognition performance.|$|R

500|$|In casting Al [...] "Gee" [...] Giardello, Levinson {{decided not}} to make the {{character}} Italian-American like the real-life counterpart Gary D'Addario, but rather cast Yaphet Kotto and made the character a Sicilian-African American. Kotto, who turned down two feature film offers to accept the Homicide role, was extremely impressed with Levinson's choices for the character, saying, [...] "They had the daring to make the artistic choice without prejudice of any kind. I don't think there's another network show on the air with this sort of cast composition." [...] Kotto struggled at first with the show's production style and constantly <b>moving</b> <b>camera</b> style, which flustered him and made him forget his lines. Levinson had to personally reassure him that he could handle the part. Clark Johnson was cast as Meldrick Lewis, and Jon Polito as his partner, Steve Crosetti. When Polito first auditioned, he read the role of a Polish cop, then did a second reading for an Irish role based on Detective Sergeant Terrence McLarney.

500|$|Walker {{notes that}} Kubrick was {{influenced}} by the tracking and [...] "fluid camera" [...] styles of director Max Ophüls, and used them in many of his films, including Paths of Glory and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Kubrick noted how in Ophuls' films [...] "the camera went through every wall and every floor". He once named Ophüls' Le Plaisir (1952) as his favorite film. According to film historian John Wakeman, Ophüls himself learned the technique from director Anatole Litvak in the 1930s, when he was his assistant, and whose work was [...] "replete with the camera trackings, pans and swoops which later became the trademark of Max Ophüls". [...] Geoffrey Cocks believes that Kubrick was also influenced by Ophüls' stories of thwarted love and a preoccupation with predatory men, while Herr notes that Kubrick was deeply inspired by G. W. Pabst, who earlier tried, but was unable to adapt Schnitzler's Traumnovelle, the basis of Eyes Wide Shut. Film critic Robert Kolker sees the influence of Welles' <b>moving</b> <b>camera</b> shots on Kubrick's style. LoBrutto notes that Kubrick identified with Welles and influenced the making of The Killing, with its [...] "multiple points of view, extreme angles, and deep focus". Kubrick also cited David Lynch's Eraserhead (1977) as one of his favorite films and used it as a creative reference during the directing of The Shining.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{calibration}} {{of cameras}} from external orientation information and image processing is {{addressed in this}} paper.

For freely <b>moving</b> <b>cameras</b> the calibration problem is also linear but underdetermined for fully varying internal parameters.

This statistical calibration is fully determined even for freely <b>moving</b> <b>cameras.</b> ...|$|R

[...] Film critic Ellison Estefan, writing for Estefan Films, believes that the sequence is responsible for [...] "add another dimension to the characters as they continue to fall deeply in love with each other." [...] Explaining the song's role in the film, director Kirk Wise described the scene as [...] "the culmination of their relationship," [...] while producer Don Hahn pegged it as [...] "the bonding moment of the film when the two main characters finally get together." [...] The scene had long been envisioned as having a more live-action feel to it than the rest of the film, an idea that originated from story artists Brenda Chapman and Roger Allers, who were the first to suggest that the ballroom be built using computers. As the film's executive producer, former Head of Disney's film division Jeffrey Katzenberg recalled that he began working on Beauty and the Beast deciding what its [...] "wowie" [...] moment would be, defining this as [...] "the moment in the movie where you see what's on the screen and go, 'Wow-IEE'"; this ultimately became the film's ballroom sequence. According to Hahn, the scene was conceived out of the filmmakers' desire to manipulate the camera in order to [...] "sweep" [...] the audience away. Allers and Chapman conceived the ballroom in order to provide the characters with an area in which they could linger, and were surprised by the amount of artistic freedom with which they were provided by the animators, who agreed to adjust to the changes in perspective that would result from the <b>moving</b> <b>camera.</b> While Allers decided to raise the camera in order to view the dancing couple from the overhead chandelier, Chapman decided to rotate the camera around Belle's skirt as the couple danced past it.|$|E
