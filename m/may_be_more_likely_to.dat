For example, statistics can indicate which specific pitchers a certain batter performs best against.

5|$|A {{few days}} after the murders, the Ministry of Interior {{announced}} its deliberation about making the gun license registry accessible to psychiatrists in order to give them the ability to report to police possible changes of mental state of their patients having an impact on their eligibility to possess firearms. This was, however, rejected by psychiatric associations. They argued that psychiatrists' main goal is to cure patients, and that potential patients <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> avoid psychiatric treatment for fear of losing their gun license.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{blood lead}} levels {{steadily}} increase with increasing age. In adults of all ages, men have higher blood lead levels than women do. Children {{are more sensitive}} to elevated blood lead levels than adults are. Children may also have a higher intake of lead than adults; they breathe faster and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have contact with and ingest soil. Children of ages one to three tend to have the highest blood lead levels, possibly because at that age they begin to walk and explore their environment, and they use their mouths in their exploration. Blood levels usually peak at about 18–24months old. In many countries including the US, household paint and dust are the major route of exposure in children.|$|E

25|$|To {{the extent}} that the {{exhaustion}} doctrine is grounded in considerations of public policy, and to {{the extent that}} the interests of the public and third parties (such as Quanta in the Quanta case) are to be considered as well as those of the contracting parties, the courts <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> place limits on whether the parties can by contract make the doctrine inapplicable to the goods that are the subject of their contract. On the other hand, if the policy of the exhaustion doctrine is seen merely as a rule to make sure that downstream purchasers get fair notice that their use of goods whose purchase they are considering will be restricted, courts <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> uphold such restrictions unless they collide with other policies, such as those of competition or antitrust law.|$|E
25|$|While {{agreeable}} {{individuals are}} habitually likely to help others, disagreeable people <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> cause harm.

People low in agreeableness {{are also more likely}} to be prejudiced against stigmatized groups such as the overweight.|$|E
50|$|A single {{autoantibody}} test is not diagnostic, but {{may give}} {{clues as to}} whether a particular disorder is likely or unlikely to be present. Each autoantibody result should be considered individually {{and as part of}} the group. Some disorders, such as SLE <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> if several autoantibodies are present, while others, such as MCTD (mixed connective tissue disease) <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> if a single autoantibody, RNP - ribonucleic protein is the only one present. Those who have more than one autoimmune disorder may have several detectable autoantibodies.|$|R

5000|$|The {{increased}} risk {{is believed to}} be primarily due to the same risk factors that produced the first cancer, such as the person's genetic profile, alcohol and tobacco use, obesity, and environmental exposures, and partly due, in some cases, to the treatment for the first cancer, which might have included mutagenic chemotherapeutic drugs or radiation.

25|$|The American Psychological Association's 1995 report Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns {{stated that}} the {{correlation}} between IQ and crime was −0.2. It was −0.19 between IQ scores and number of juvenile offenses in a large Danish sample; with social class controlled, the correlation dropped to −0.17. A correlation of 0.20 means that the explained variance is 4%. The causal links between psychometric ability and social outcomes may be indirect. Children with poor scholastic performance may feel alienated. Consequently, they <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> engage in delinquent behavior, compared to other children who do well.|$|E
25|$|Like other opioid drugs, {{pethidine}} has {{the potential}} to cause physical dependence or addiction. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be abused than other prescription opioids, perhaps because of its rapid onset of action. When compared with oxycodone, hydromorphone, and placebo, pethidine was consistently associated with more euphoria, difficulty concentrating, confusion, and impaired psychomotor and cognitive performance when administered to healthy volunteers. The especially severe side effects unique to pethidine among opioids—serotonin syndrome, seizures, delirium, dysphoria, tremor—are primarily or entirely due to the action of its metabolite, norpethidine.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to hyperglycemia, significant weight gain is frequently experienced by patients treated with clozapine. Impaired glucose metabolism and obesity {{have been shown}} to be constituents of the metabolic syndrome and may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. The data suggest that clozapine <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> cause adverse metabolic effects than some of the other atypical antipsychotics. A study has established that olanzapine and clozapine disturb the metabolism by making the body take preferentially its energy from fat (instead of privileging carbohydrates). Levels of carbohydrates remaining high, the body develops insulin resistance (causing diabetes).|$|E

25|$|Some {{research}} shows that LGBT homeless youth <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> abuse substances than their heterosexual counterparts. For example, a 2002 study using structured interviews of homeless youth in the Seattle area found {{that in the past}} six months, sexual minority youth had used each tested substance (including marijuana, cocaine/crack, acid, ecstasy, and several others) more frequently than heterosexual youth. That being said, a 2008 study that used interviews of substance-abusing homeless youth in the Southwestern United States found no significant difference in drug use between heterosexual and gay, lesbian and transgender youth within its sample.|$|E
25|$|Emerging {{research}} suggests that gay men from religious backgrounds are likely to come out online via Facebook and Blogs as it offers a protective interpersonal distance. This largely contradicts the growing movement in social media research indicating that online use, particularly Facebook, can lead to negative mental health outcomes such as increased levels of anxiety. While {{further research is needed}} to assess whether these results generalize to a larger sample, these recent findings open the door to the possibility that gay men's online experiences may differ from heterosexuals' in that it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> provide mental health benefits than consequences.|$|E
25|$|T. stagnalis is {{the only}} Anostracan species to occur in Ireland, and {{one of only two}} in the British Isles (the other being Chirocephalus diaphanus which occurs in a few sites in {{southern}} England). It was discovered in Rahasane turlough in 1974, and was soon discovered at six other sites, in temporary pools in fields, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> represent the species' usual habitat. T. stagnalis is thought to have arrived in Ireland in mud on the legs of a migratory bird, or on the footwear of a wildfowler; various ducks such as mallard, teal and shoveller, and waders such as lapwing and curlew have been observed in Ireland after migrating from areas with T. stagnalis populations, such as Scandinavia and France.|$|E

25|$|The McGurk {{effect is}} a perceptual {{phenomenon}} that demonstrates an interaction between hearing and vision in speech perception. The illusion occurs when the auditory component of one sound is paired with the visual component of another sound, leading to the perception of a third sound. The visual information a person gets from seeing a person speak changes the way they hear the sound. If a person is getting poor quality auditory information but good quality visual information, they <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> experience the McGurk effect. Integration abilities for audio and visual information may also influence whether a person will experience the effect. People who are better at sensory integration {{have been shown to}} be more susceptible to the effect. Many people are affected differently by the McGurk effect based on many factors, including brain damage and other disorders.|$|E
25|$|The northernmost {{subspecies}} C. c. bromia is migratory, {{subject to}} necessity. It may withdraw several hundred kilometres {{south in the}} northernmost parts of its range. Thousands of blue jays have been observed to migrate in flocks along the Great Lakes and Atlantic coasts. It migrates during the daytime, in loose flocks of 5 to 250 birds. Much about their migratory behavior remains a mystery. Some are present throughout winter {{in all parts of}} their range. Young jays <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> migrate than adults, but many adults also migrate. Some individual jays migrate south one year, stay north the next winter, and then migrate south again the next year. To date, no one has concretely worked out why they migrate when they do. Likely, it is related to weather conditions and how abundant the winter food sources are, which can determine whether other northern birds will move south.|$|E
25|$|Attachment {{influences}} {{both the}} perception of support from others and the tendency to seek support from others. People who have attachments who respond consistently and positively to requests for closeness allow individuals to have secure attachments, and in return they seek more support, in a generally relaxed way, while people whose attachments are inconsistent in reacting positively or regularly reject requests for support find they need to use other attachment styles. People with secure attachment styles may trust their attachments to provide support because their attachments have reliably offered support in the past. They <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> ask for support when it's needed. People with insecure attachment styles often {{do not have a}} history of supportive responses from their attachments. They may rely less on their attachments and be less likely to ask for support when it's needed, though there may be other factors involved, as well.|$|E

500|$|Because the {{ordinance}} imposed content-based restrictions on free speech, Justice Thomas held that {{the ordinance}} would only be constitutional if it survived strict scrutiny. Assuming that the town's interests of preserving aesthetic appeal and traffic safety were compelling, he concluded that these were [...] "hopelessly underinclusive" [...] because the ordinance allowed for the proliferation of an unlimited number of larger, ideological signs that pose the same threats to aesthetics and traffic as directional signs. In fact, Justice Thomas suggested that a [...] "sharply worded" [...] ideological sign <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> distract drivers than a directional sign.

500|$|The {{issue is}} often {{discussed}} in the media in terms of offensiveness or political correctness, which reduces it to feelings and opinions, and prevents full understanding of the historical, psychological and sociological context provided by academic research on {{the negative effects of}} the use of Native American names and images by sports teams. The effect of stereotyping on high or low expectations, confidence, and academic performance has been well-established. This effect is enhanced due to the invisibility of Native Americans in mainstream society and media, leaving stereotypes as the primary basis for thinking about the abilities and traits associated with Natives, including the roles and opportunities Natives Americans envision for themselves. Furthermore, even when stereotypes are positive (e.g. [...] "Natives Americans are spiritual"), they may have a limiting, detrimental effect on individuals. Stereotyping may directly affect the academic performance and self-esteem of Native American youth, whose people face high rates of suicide, unemployment, and poverty. Euro-Americans exposed to mascots <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> believe not only that such stereotypes are true, but that Native Americans have no identity beyond these stereotypes. Research indicates that exposure to any stereotypes increased the likelihood of stereotypical thinking with regard to other minority groups in addition to the target of the stereotype, a [...] "spreading effect".|$|E
