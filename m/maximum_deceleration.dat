[...] Prior streetcar control, existing from the 1890s, required a standing operator at a three foot high vertical [...] "switch stand" [...] to rotate a handle to one of six brass points mounted within the stand to provide traction motor control and acceleration. The PCC had its accelerator under the floor where the pedal activated linkage to resistance ribbons were mounted to each PCC point around the outside edge of the accelerator. [...] An arm rotating in the center had rollers on either end which cut out resistance alternately as it rotated approximately 180 degrees. [...] This same accelerator was also used for dynamic braking; when the power pedal was released the accelerator sought optimum braking for the speed, which prevented a lag when the brake pedal was depressed. [...] General Electric Developed a control system for PCC cars that mirrored the Westinghouse scheme in function, although not in simplicity or maintainability. [...] With the GE commutator motor controller operating by air pressure, {{it had to be}} redesigned {{with the advent of the}} All-Electric PCC. [...] Acceleration was variable between 1.5- and 4.75-mph per second depending upon the depression of the power pedal with the accelerator advanced automatically by a low-voltage pilot motor.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this work, the {{investigation}} of the assistance of anticipatory driving is presented. The goal is to explore the effects of such an assistance system on driver’s behaviour in deceleration situations. The influence of the system is derived using the comparison between assisted and unassisted drives performed in a fixed-base simulator. The benefits are evaluated via analyzing driving and visual data with respect to safety, comfort, and efficiency criteria. The results show that drivers with assistance start decelerating significantly earlier in some of the investigated situations, predominantly by coasting a vehicle. The mean <b>maximum</b> <b>decelerations</b> are reduced from 8, 5 m/s 2 to 6, 2 m/s 2 in the safety critical situation, and the fuel consumption tends to sink on 4 % in the entire drive. ...|$|R

The {{results of the investigation}} are presented in table form, photographs, and curves. The airplane should be ditched at the lowest speed and highest attitude consistent with adequate control; the flaps should be full down. The airplane will probably make a deep but fairly smooth run.

50|$|The corner entry phase often {{begins with}} straight-line {{threshold}} braking where {{the goal is}} to achieve <b>maximum</b> <b>deceleration</b> rate. This is followed by the turn-in where the driver begins to steer the vehicle toward the apex. Traditionally, many drivers were taught to complete all braking before this turn-in portion and take a more circular path with a constant speed to the apex. Later, many racing drivers started to incorporate trail-braking into their corner entry. Trail-braking involves carrying brake pressure past the turn-in point which allows the forces generated by the tires to decelerate the car in a more optimized direction. This more optimized direction of force causes a vehicle to travel on a Euler spiral shaped path of decreasing radius to the apex. If done properly, this results in a higher average speed and lower elapsed time to the apex compared to the traditional circular entry.|$|E

50|$|Brakes on a {{race car}} are {{imperative}} in slowing and stopping the car at precise times and wear quickly depending on the road or track on which the car is being raced, how many laps are being run, track conditions due to weather, and how many caution runs require more braking. There are three variables to consider in racing: brake pedal displacement, brake pedal force, and vehicle deceleration. Various combinations of these variables work together to determine the stiffness, sensitivity, and pedal force of the brakes. When using the brakes effectively, the driver must go through a buildup phase and end with a modulating phase. These phases include attaining <b>maximum</b> <b>deceleration</b> and modulating the brake pressure. Brake performance is measured in bite and consistency. Bite happens when the driver first applies the brakes {{and they have not}} warmed up to the correct temperature to operate efficiently. Consistency is measured in how consistent the friction is during the entire time of braking. These two measurements determine the wear of the brakes.|$|E
5000|$|A spacecraft's mission {{objective}} determines what flight {{requirements are}} needed to ensure mission success. These flight requirements are deceleration, heating, and impact and landing accuracy. A spacecraft must have maximum value of deceleration low {{enough to keep the}} weakest points of its vehicle intact but high enough to penetrate the atmosphere without rebounding. Spacecraft structure and payload mass affect how much <b>maximum</b> <b>deceleration</b> it can stand. This force is represented by [...] "g's", or Earth's gravitational acceleration. If its structure is well-designed enough and made from robust material (such as steel), then it can withstand a higher amount of g's. However, payload needs to be considered. Just because the spacecraft's structure can withstand high g's does not mean its payload can. For example, a payload of astronauts can only withstand 12 g's, or 12 times their weight. Values that are more than this baseline will cause death. It must also be able to withstand high temperature caused by the immense friction resulting from entering the atmosphere at hypersonic speed. Finally, it must be able to penetrate an atmosphere and land on a terrain accurately, without missing its target. A more constricted landing area calls for more strict accuracy. In such cases, a spacecraft will be more streamlined and possess a steeper re-entry trajectory angle. These factors combine to affect the re-entry corridor, the area in which a spacecraft must travel in order to avoid burning up or rebounding out of an atmosphere.All of these above requirements are met through the consideration, design, and adjustment of a spacecraft's structure and trajectory.|$|E
