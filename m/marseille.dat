5|$|He {{scored two}} more {{victories}} on 23 and 28 April, his {{first in the}} North African Campaign. However, on 23 April, <b>Marseille</b> himself was shot down during his third sortie of that day by Sous-Lieutenant James Denis a Free French pilot with No. 73 Squadron RAF (8.5 victories), flying a Hawker Hurricane. Marseille's Bf 109 received almost 30 hits in the cockpit area, and three or four shattered the canopy. As <b>Marseille</b> was leaning forward the rounds missed him by inches. <b>Marseille</b> managed to crash-land his fighter. Just a month later, records show that James Denis shot down <b>Marseille</b> again on 21 May 1941. <b>Marseille</b> engaged Denis, but overshot his target. A turning dogfight ensued, in which Denis once again bested <b>Marseille.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ajax {{accepted}} a €12million bid for Mido from <b>Marseille</b> in July, and completed the move on {{a five-year contract}} on 12 July 2003, which made Mido the most expensive Egyptian player ever. He made his debut for <b>Marseille</b> in 1–0 win over Guingamp on 1 August 2003. Jean-Pierre Papin gave praise to Mido, saying it was down to players like him that the French Ligue 1 was among the top European leagues. He scored against Real Madrid in a UEFA Champions League match in November, which <b>Marseille</b> lost 2–1.|$|E

I.(Jagd)/LG 2 claimed three aerial victories for the loss of four Bf 109s that day. <b>Marseille</b> was in serious trouble when arriving back at the airfield. He had abandoned his leader Staffelkapitän Adolf Buhl, who was shot down and killed. He received a stern rebuke and final warning from Herbert Ihlefeld, during which he tore up his flight evaluations with a visibly upset <b>Marseille</b> looking on. Other pilots were voicing their dissent concerning <b>Marseille.</b> Because of his alienation of other pilots, his arrogant and unapologetic nature, Ihlefeld would eventually dismiss <b>Marseille</b> from LG 2.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} three days Marseille's Staffel was rested and taken off flying duties.

Hitler was to make a speech at the Berlin Sportpalast on 30 September and Rommel and <b>Marseille</b> were to attend. <b>Marseille</b> rejected this offer, citing that he was needed at the front and had already taken three months' vacation that year. <b>Marseille</b> also said he wanted to take leave at Christmas, to marry his fiancée Hanne-Lies Küpper.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, Diarra was heavily linked with a move to the champions <b>Marseille.</b> On 14 July, <b>Marseille</b> manager Didier Deschamps {{confirmed}} that the club was negotiating with both Diarra and Bordeaux for a transfer. A week later, Bordeaux president Triaud stated that <b>Marseille</b> had failed to meet the player's €7.75million release clause and that Diarra was likely not going to be leaving the club. Despite <b>Marseille</b> remaining hopeful a deal could go through, on 30 July, a deal was declared dead. Diarra later stated that he was happy to remain at Bordeaux and see out the rest of his contract. The defensive midfielder opened the new campaign scoring two goals in the first six matches of the season in wins over Paris Saint-Germain and Lyon.|$|E

5|$|The German Federal Archives {{still hold}} records for 109 of <b>Marseille</b> aerial victories.

5|$|The two {{missions}} of 26 September 1942 had been flown in Bf 109G-2/trop, {{in one of}} which <b>Marseille</b> had shot down seven Allied aircraft. The first six of these machines were to replace the Gruppes Bf 109Fs. All had been allocated to Marseille's 3 Staffel. <b>Marseille</b> had previously ignored orders to use these new aircraft because of its high engine failure rate, but on the orders of Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, <b>Marseille</b> reluctantly obeyed. One of these machines, WK-Nr. 14256 (Engine: Daimler-Benz DB 605 A-1, W.Nr. 77 411), {{was to be the}} final aircraft <b>Marseille</b> flew.|$|E
5|$|Another account {{recalled}} how <b>Marseille</b> once ignored {{an order to}} turn back from a fight when outnumbered by two to one, but seeing an Allied aircraft closing on his wing leader, <b>Marseille</b> broke formation and shot the attacking aircraft down. Expecting congratulations when he landed, his commander was critical of his actions, receiving three days of confinement for failing to carry out an order. Days later, <b>Marseille</b> was passed over for promotion and was now the sole Fähnrich in the Geschwader. This was a humiliation for him, suspecting that his abilities were being suppressed so the squadron leaders could take all the glory in the air.|$|E

5|$|Ben Arfa's career {{started in}} the Île-de-France region, where he trained at AC Boulogne-Billancourt and Versailles. In 1999, he was {{selected}} to attend the Clairefontaine academy. He spent three years there before leaving for Lyon, where he won four Ligue 1 titles. In his early career at Lyon, he played as a centre forward, but moved into a winger role during the 2007–08 season. In the summer of 2008, Ben Arfa signed with rivals <b>Marseille</b> for €11million {{in a move that}} required the intervention of the Ligue de Football Professionnel. With <b>Marseille,</b> he won the 2009–10 league title, his fifth overall, as well as the Coupe de la Ligue in 2010. After two years at <b>Marseille,</b> Ben Arfa joined English club Newcastle United on loan for the 2010–11 season. The deal was made permanent later in the season.|$|E

5|$|He {{was handed}} his Ligue 1 debut by Bielsa {{on the opening}} day of the 2014–15 season in a 3–3 draw with Bastia. Sparagna started the match before being {{substituted}} at half-time for Brazilian Lucas Mendes with <b>Marseille</b> leading 2–1. He went on to make three further appearances for the senior side during the campaign, amassing a total of 73 minutes of playing time as <b>Marseille</b> ended the season in fourth place. At {{the end of the season}} Sparagna signed his first professional contract with l'OM, ending months of speculation linking him with a Bosman move to Premier League club Arsenal. Having lost Mathieu Flamini to Arsenal on a Bosman deal in 2008, <b>Marseille</b> were prompt to conclude a new deal with Sparagna in order to avoid a repeat occurrence.|$|E
5|$|His {{tactic of}} diving into {{opposing}} formations often found him {{under fire from}} all directions, resulting in his aircraft being damaged beyond repair; consequently, Eduard Neumann was losing his patience. <b>Marseille</b> persisted, and created a unique self-training programme for himself, both physical and tactical, which resulted not just in outstanding situational awareness, marksmanship and confident control of the aircraft, but also in a unique attack tactic that preferred a high angle deflection shooting attack and shooting at the target's front from the side, instead of the common method of chasing an aircraft and shooting at it directly from behind. <b>Marseille</b> often practiced these tactics {{on the way back}} from missions with his comrades. <b>Marseille</b> became known as a master of deflection shooting.|$|E
