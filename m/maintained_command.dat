He <b>maintained</b> <b>command</b> of his Texas Brigade as well until November 26, 1862. Now {{consisting}} of 160 barefoot men the 18th Georgia Regiment was transferred to Cobb's Brigade, McLaws' Division, remaining in Longstreet's Corps. Cobb's brigade was composed of the 16th, 24th, and 18th Georgia Regiments, Cobb's Legion, and Phillips' Legion. The 18th Georgia Regiment remained assigned to Longstreet's Corps {{until the end of}} the war.

500|$|At {{the time}} of the invasion, the Royal Yugoslav Army ( [...] , VKJ) {{consisted}} of 29 infantry divisions, three horse cavalry divisions, and a divisional-sized mountain detachment. There were also a significant number of independent infantry, cavalry, mountain, and combined arms brigades, infantry and cavalry regiments and fortress troops, as well as 17 border guard battalions. The Commander-in-chief of the VKJ was the 17-year-old King Peter II, and the Chief of the General Staff was the Prime Minister, Armijski đeneral Dušan Simović. The Yugoslav defence plan positioned almost all land forces close to its borders, with very limited strategic reserves in depth. The VKJ was heavily reliant on animal-powered transport, mainly oxen, and had only 50 relatively modern Renault R35 tanks that could fight German tanks on an equal footing, although these were only just being formed into a unit at {{the time of}} the invasion. The VKJ was organised into the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Army Groups, the independent 5th and 6th Armies and the Coastal Defence Command. The General Headquarters of the VKJ <b>maintained</b> <b>command</b> over five infantry divisions and a large number of smaller infantry, engineer and artillery units, as well as the only operational tank battalion. Each Army Group and independent Army was supported by an air reconnaissance group attached from the VVKJ. As mobilisation had been tentative and partial, many divisions were still in the process of mobilisation on 6 April 1941. The VKJ order of battle on 6 April 1941 is detailed below as provided by Niehorster.|$|E

50|$|Having {{been given}} {{command of the}} torpedo boat Nicola Fabrizi, on the night between November 11 and 12, 1940 Barbini was escorting a convoy in the Southern Adriatic, when the latter came under attack by four light cruisers and two destroyers under Vice Admiral Henry Pridham-Wippell. In the ensuing battle, while the escort leader in the {{auxiliary}} cruiser RAMB III whitdrew after firing a few shots, Barbini counterattacked twice with guns and torpedoes (that could not be fired due to the damage suffered), {{in an attempt to}} draw enemy fire on his ship and distract the British force from the merchant ships. Fabrizi was heavily damaged, and was ultimately unable to prevent the convoy's destruction; on fire and slowly sinking, the torpedo boat limped into Vlorë (Valona). Barbini had been seriously wounded {{at the beginning of the}} battle, but despite serious blood loss from a wounded leg, he refused medical aid until the fighting was over, and <b>maintained</b> <b>command</b> of his ship until it was safely moored in harbour.

50|$|Java {{started the}} battle badly out-matched {{both in terms}} of the {{experience}} of her crew and the weight of her broadside. Constitution, with her experienced commander and crew, countered by not shortening sail as was standard (this reduced strain on the masts thus making it less likely to lose a mast under fire). By 2 PM both ships were heading southeast. The opening phase of the action comprised both ships turning to and from attempting to get the better position for which to fire upon and rake the other, but with little success. Bainbridge now wore Constitution to a matching course and opened fire with a broadside at half a mile. This broadside accomplished nothing and forced Bainbridge to risk raking to close Java. Another broadside from Java carried away Constitutions helm, disabling her rudder and leaving Bainbridge severely wounded; however he still <b>maintained</b> <b>command</b> refusing to sit out the battle. Both ships resumed firing broadsides but by now Java had a mast and sail falling over her starboard side that prevented most of her guns on that side from firing, which also prevented her from laying alongside Constitution. The guns that attempted to fire only managed to set the fallen sail and rigging ablaze.|$|E

50|$|On 29 December 1812, Bainbridge fell in {{with the}} 38-gun , {{off the coast of}} Brazil. Java was a vessel of 1,083 tons, {{formerly}} the French frigate Renommée. She had a crew of 400 men under Captain Henry Lambert and {{was on her way to}} the East Indies, carrying the newly appointed Lieutenant-General Hislop of Bombay and his staff along with despatches to St. Helena, Cape of Good Hope and every British port in the Indian and China Seas. She had an inexperienced crew with only a very few trained seamen, and her men had only had one days gunnery drill. In addition to her crew, Java was carrying more than four hundred officers and seamen who were to join the British fleet in the East Indies, among them Captain John Marshall who was to take command of a sloop of war stationed there. Under Bainbridge, Constitution had a crack crew who were well drilled in gunnery; the crew of Java were not. Java was virtually cut to pieces, with its rigging almost completely destroyed, and was forced to surrender, while having inflicted little damage to Constitution, other than removing Constitutions helm with a lucky shot. During the action, Bainbridge was wounded twice, but <b>maintained</b> <b>command</b> throughout; even replacing the missing helm on Constitution with the one from Java before she was destroyed and sank. To this day, the still-commissioned Constitution (anchored in Boston Harbor) sports the helm that Bainbridge salvaged from Java. Javas crew was taken prisoner and put aboard Constitution in the hold. Because of the heavy damage inflicted on Java and the great distance from the American coast, Bainbridge decided to burn and sink the British frigate. On March 3, 1813, President Madison presented Bainbridge with the Congressional Gold Medal for his service aboard Constitution.|$|E

50|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{in action}} {{at the risk of}} his life above and beyond the call of duty. S/Sgt. (then Sgt.) Lambers distinguished himself in action while serving with the 3d platoon, Company A. The unit had established a night defensive position astride a suspected enemy infiltration route, when it was attacked by an estimated Viet Cong battalion. During the initial enemy onslaught, the platoon leader fell seriously wounded and S/Sgt. Lambers assumed command of the platoon. Disregarding the intense enemy fire, S/Sgt. Lambers left his covered position, secured the platoon radio and moved to the command post to direct the defense. When his radio became inoperative due to enemy action, S/Sgt. Lambers crossed the fire swept position to secure the 90mm recoilless rifle crew's radio in order to re-establish communications. Upon discovering that the 90mm recoilless rifle was not functioning, S/Sgt. Lambers assisted in the repair of the weapon and directed canister fire at point-blank range against the attacking enemy who had breached the defensive wire of the position. When the weapon was knocked out by enemy fire, he single-handedly repulsed a penetration of the position by detonating claymore mines and throwing grenades into the midst of the attackers, killing 4 more of the Viet Cong with well aimed hand grenades. S/Sgt. Lambers <b>maintained</b> <b>command</b> of the platoon elements by moving from position to position under the hail of enemy fire, providing assistance where the assault was the heaviest and by his outstanding example inspiring his men to the utmost efforts of courage. He displayed great skill and valor throughout the 5-hour battle by personally directing artillery and helicopter fire, placing them at times within 5 meters of the defensive position. He repeatedly exposed himself to hostile fire at great risk to his own life in order to redistribute ammunition and to care for seriously wounded comrades and to move them to sheltered positions. S/Sgt. Lambers' superb leadership, professional skill and magnificent courage saved the lives of his comrades, resulted in the virtual annihilation of a vastly superior enemy force and were largely instrumental in thwarting an enemy offensive against Tay Ninh City. His gallantry at the risk of his life is in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit upon himself, his unit, and the U.S. Army.|$|E
