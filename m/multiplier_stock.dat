Micropropagated stock plants were planted in a soilless growing system. Runner tips bearing at least one visible root nodule were harvested at 43, 66 and 87 days after planting, rooted and planted as <b>multiplied</b> <b>stock</b> plants for producing plug plants. Treatments consisted of micropropagated stock plants of cultivars INIA Arazá, INIA Guenoa and INIA Yvapitá, planted on October 1 st, 2008 (T 1); <b>multiplied</b> <b>stock</b> plants planted on November 28 th (T 2) and on December 21 st, 2008 (T 3), and on January, 10 th, 2009 (T 4). On May 22 nd, 2009, stock plants were defoliated and plug plants of the same cultivars were planted as control for fruit production. Early fruit yield and number of fruits were higher on stock plants, but fresh fruit yield was higher on control plants. Total fruit yield and number were higher on stock plants of 'INIA Arazá' and 'INIA Guenoa'. We concluded that strawberry stock plants reach higher early and total fresh fruit yield than plug transplants in the second cropping year after producing runner tips in a soilless growing system.

25|$|Micropropagation, {{also known}} as tissue culture, is the {{practice}} of rapidly <b>multiplying</b> <b>stock</b> plant material to produce {{a large number of}} progeny plants. Micropropagation uses in vitro division of small pieces in a sterile environment, where they first produce proliferations of tissue, which are then separated into small pieces that are treated differently so that they produce roots and new stem tissue. The steps in the process are regulated by different ratios of plant growth regulators. Many commercial organizations have produced cannas this way, and specifically the “Island Series” of cannas was introduced by means of mass-produced plants using this technique. However, cannas have a reputation for being difficult micropropagation candidates.|$|R

Despite this, we are concerned on economical equilibrium using linear ordered spaces. In the following, we consider the real situation in which only a finite number of products are produced, exchanged or consumed. Such a model was first presented in [4]. The stocks set has to be considered as having a triple structure; linear, ordered and topological one. This means: 1. a linear structure, since by summing two <b>stocks</b> or by <b>multiplying</b> a <b>stock</b> with a scalar we still obtain also stocks. 2. an ordered structure: if two stocks x, y are in the relation x>y,this means that ”x is bigger than y ” and this is taken as negative input for production (because it supposes consuming) and as output having positive sign...|$|R

Based on the theoretical concepts of financial reporting, the knowledge which has qualitative attributes of financial information is useful. Relatedness and reliability are the main qualitative attributes of the content of information and prudence or conservatism {{is one of the main}} attributes of reliability. The ratio of market value to the book value represents total value of capital market (total common stock) of the company divided by the book value of the company's total assets. Market value of the company's total capital (common stock) is calculated by <b>multiplying</b> the <b>stock</b> market value (in the last days of financial year) by the number of common stock. The book value of common stock is equal to the total items written in the owner's equity section (belonging to the common stock) in the balance sheet.

Major projects to improve the dairy goat sector were not realized until the late 1970 s under United Nations Development Programmes (UNDP) funded and FAO executed projects, which lasted until the mid 1980 s. The initial projects were mainly government station-based, and aimed at <b>multiplying</b> improved <b>stock</b> for distribution to farmers. Due to several technical, logistical and financial constraints the station-based projects failed to meet their objectives, and by 1996, despite huge financial investments in this endeavour, only a total of approximately 40, 000 improved goats were available in Kenya. The farmers were not directly involved and genotype-by-environment interaction issues were not duly taken into account in designing and executing the projects. In early to mid 1990 s, the German Development Corporation (GTZ) and FARM Africa initiated new approaches that were community-based and farmer-led in two regions of Kenya. Genetic improvement activities were now based on-farm, as opposed to government stations. Farmers and farmer-group members were rigorously trained on breeding programme designs and management, husbandry, including primary healthcare and were facilitated to run their show with frontline technical support from the NGO's and government officers. In just 7 years, the dairy goat population has risen to more than 90, 000 head, hence doubled over the 7 -year period. In addition, the improved goat technology is alive with many NGOs replicating the new approach. The community participation in the crucial areas of service provision, animal health delivery, marketing and quality control has strongly influenced this development. The challenges, successes and other experiences of these two Kenyan projects are presented and illustrated by way of a case study as to how simple participatory approaches can actually lead to significant improvement in the livelihoods of the rural resource poor families...|$|R

This new clone is now widely known as M- 31 in the production fields and Adira 4 in the official registration. The economic benefit generated by the new cultivar started with the additional root harvests and additional starch produced within UJF, but it soon spread into the production fields of thousands of small farmers. Hard data, and a few extrapolations from these, indicate that Adira 4 is now planted in more than 100, 000 ha and the additional economic effects caused by its adoption is more than 194 million US dollars, of which at least one half has directly entered the household income of innumerable small farmers.

The suggested hypothesis is that the right price of manufactures listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2004 up to 2007 are in overpriced condition. The calculation used in this research is calculating right fair price using purchase option value table,stock price percentages and following every step. Multiply standart deviation of stock price changes with the root ot time period of option to be mature. Count the ratio of stock value to present value (PV) of exercise prices of the option. Consider the option presentation table, vertical axis shows the multiples of standard deviation of stock price change with the roof of mature period. Horizontal axis shows the ratio of stock price divided by PV of exercise price. Ratio value as the intersection result of vertical and horizontal axis <b>multiplies</b> with current <b>stock</b> price, it is obtained purchase option (right) fair price. Hypothesis tests if intrinsic value(right fair price) > market price, right is in overpriced condition. If intrinsic value(right fair price) = market price, right is in break-even condition. While, if intrinsic value (right fair price) < market price, right is in underpriced condition. From the calculation result, it is obtained that most of manufactures are in overpriced price.

40|$|The Korup {{rainforest}} of Southwest Cameroon {{is an area}} {{of unique}} biological diversity. However, hunting and trapping by people living within the protected zone of the Korup National Park, and in the areas immediately outside it, are eliminating many animal species, including elephant, giant pangolin and many small mammals. The decline in coffee and cocoa prices has led to an increase in sales and consumption of 'bush' meat as people have sought alternative sources of income and food. If continued unchecked, hunting and trapping would lead to the breakdown of the intricate biological web of species interdependence and the destruction of the forest. For example, the World Resources Institute has identified 71 plant species which have germinated after passing through the gut of elephants. These comprise about 11 % of all vascular plants found at Korup and the destruction of elephants alone would jeopardize and perhaps prevent the dispersal and continued survival of many plants. There are six villages within the Park and 100 villages in the surrounding area with a total population of about 27, 000. It was recognized by me Government of Cameroon and international conservation organizations that it was essential for a project to be set up that would work in harmony with the local population through education, involvement and, most importantly, by providing alternative sources of income. The urgent requirement for a positive, structured approach to rural development in the Korup area to help manage me resources of the forest on a sustainable basis has been met by me Korup National Park Project. This was set up in collaboration with the Government of Cameroon and has been managed by the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF). The European Union is the principal funding agency. Other significant donors are UK Overseas Development Administration (ODA) and the German Development Agency (GTZ). Between 1993 and 1996 ODA funding is specifically supporting a rural development component to raise standards of living for both individuals and communities through a variety of rural enterprises and improvements in infrastructure. Activities include projects for rearing small livestock, using improved planting material, developing community farms to <b>multiply</b> improved planting <b>stock,</b> and planting local and exotic fruit trees. EU funding includes financial aid for infrastructural development such as the construction of primary schools, health centres, water supplies and roads. Resettlement of villagers from within to outside the Park is a major concern of the Cameroon authorities. If the Korup forest within the Park is to survive the local people must be assisted and guided to develop a system for exploiting the animals and plants in the zone surrounding the Park on a sustainable basis. If the wildlife within the Park can be adequately protected, preferably with the full cooperation of the local people, breeding populations within the Park will produce an overspill into the surrounding area where hunting and trapping can be carried out under a proper system of controls. Feeder roads will encourage the production of a wider range of cash crops by providing easier access for bringing in inputs, and better transport links to major markets. A more intensive and productive form of agriculture should result in improved food security and thus in better nutrition levels. This in turn should greatly reduce the need for hunting wildlife, and increase household income through the sale of crops. It has been estimated that 80 % of the animals killed are sold and only 20 % are consumed. With poverty endemic in the area it is essential that resource management offers local people more than just the opportunity to substitute crops for animals as a source of income. There should be clear opportunities to gain a higher income as well as better living standards, clean water supply, education and improved communications. The Korup Project is engaged in all these aspects of development. The Korup rainforest of Southwest Cameroon {{is an area of}} unique biological diversity.
