40|$|Radiotherapy is {{a widely}} used method to treat {{malignant}} tumors. However, the sensitivity to the treatment varies between tumors, and local tumor control is not always achieved. The balance between treatment success and {{the side effects of}} the treatment affords important information for developing treatment schedules at patient population level. Conversely there are no methods to tailor treatment schedules in an individual patient in clinical practice. The purpose of such methods would be to better balance treatment success with side effects in the individual, hopefully avoiding unnecessary treatments. As some tumors are resistant to radiotherapy doses that may be delivered without severe side effects, finding methods to sensitize tumor cells is of major importance. In Paper I we evaluated a radiobiology model for predicting surviving fraction (SF) in five lung cancer cell lines. The purpose was to see whether it was important to include tumor cell proliferation during fractionated radiotherapy in a predicting radiobiology formula based on radiosensitivity, proliferation and number of tumor cells. When the clonogenic assay is used to establish SF, including proliferation seems to predict SF after fractionated radiation better than using inherent radiosensitivity alone. In Paper II we evaluated the same radiobiology model in a clinical <b>material</b> <b>of</b> <b>head</b> and neck carcinomas. In 18 patients we compared using patient-specific radiobiological parameters with using population averages. Sensitivity in predicting local recurrence and predictive values were both better with individual parameters than with population averages. The accuracy of calculated probability of local control with the patient- specific-parameter model reached borderline statistical significance (p = 0. 07). In Paper III we investigated the entire <b>material</b> <b>of</b> <b>head</b> and neck carcinoma patients, including those receiving brachytherapy using a tumor control probability (TCP) model based on biologically effective dose (BED). Again we compared patient-specific radiobiological parameters with population averages to calculate individual TCPs. Evaluating the method using an ROC curve demonstrated a statistically significant difference in discriminating between local control or not when using patient specific parameters. This difference was not seen with population averages. In Paper IV, the role of a phosphine gold(I) compound in altering radioresistance in a radioresistant human lung cancer cell line U 1810 was investigated. This effect is achieved by shifting the intracellular redox balance by inhibiting TrxR. After a single fraction of clinically relevant radiation doses, a clear radio-sensitizing effect on SF and repopulation was demonstrated. Gene expression analysis demonstrated genetic expression changes in related cellular pathways connected to DNA repair, cellular response to stress, and cell cycle...|$|R

In the previous research, a novel cryogenic CO 2 capture system based on FPSCs has been exploited. In order to enhance the cryogenic CO 2 capture efficiency, the investigation on the coefficient of performance (COP) of the FPSC is carried out in this work. In detail, the influence <b>of</b> different <b>materials</b> (aluminium and copper), size <b>of</b> cold <b>head</b> (length and diameter), as well as ambient conditions (humidity and temperature) on the COP of the cryogenic system were tested.

The main {{objective is to}} clarify the effect of mean speed, slide-to-roll ratio, and <b>material</b> <b>of</b> femoral <b>head</b> {{on the development of}} film thickness, focusing on the role of particular constituents contained in model synovial fluid, such as albumin and -globulin. For this purpose, a model ball-on-disc configuration was applied, while the development of lubricant film was evaluated using the combination of fluorescent microscopy and optical interferometry. To better understand the process, coefficient of friction between implant surfaces was later investigated as well. The effect <b>of</b> <b>material,</b> slide-to-roll ratio, mean speed and model fluid composition was analysed. Results indicate that the main parameter, influencing the character of film formation, is slide-to-roll ratio.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{mechanisms}} applying {{in the interpretation}} of syntactic chains. The theoretical background includes a translation of syntactic forms into semantic forms and a model theoretic explication of the meaning of semantic forms. Simplicity considerations apply to all three stages of the interpretation process: syntactic derivation, translation into semantic forms, interpretation of semantic forms. Three main results are achieved. The first is that trace positions can have semantic content beyond what is needed for the semantic dependency of trace and binder. This extra content is some or all <b>of</b> the lexical <b>material</b> <b>of</b> the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the chain, as expected on the copy theory of movement. Two independent arguments support this conclusion. One, discussed in chapter 2, is based on the distribution of Condition C effects, where novel interactions between variable binding, antecedent contained deletion and Condition C are observed. The second, developed in chapter 3, is based on conditions on the identity of traces observed in antecedent contained deletion constructions. Both arguments lead to the same generalizations about what lexical <b>material</b> <b>of</b> the <b>head</b> is interpreted in the trace position. The second main result is that lambda calculus is superior to both standard predicate logic and combinatorial logic as the mathematical model for the semantic mechanism mediating the dependency of trace (or bound pronoun) and binder. Chapter 4 argues this {{on the basis of the}} distribution of focus and destressing in constructions with bound pronouns. The third main result is that quantification must be allowed to range over pointwise different choice functions. Chapter 5 shows that quantification over individuals is insufficient, and that pointwise different choice functions are required. The result entails that the syntactic difference of A-chains and A-bar chains predicts a semantic difference in the type of the variable involved, which is argued to explain weak crossover phenomena. Chapters 6 argues that the interpretation procedures developed in the preceeding chapters account for all cases. It is shown that only traces of the type of individuals arise, and that scope reconstruction is a phonological phenomenon. The latter result also supports the T-model of syntax...|$|R

An accurate and efficient nonlinear {{finite element model}} was developed to study the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>headed</b> stud shear connectors welded through-deck. The profiled steel sheeting had transverse ribs perpendicular to the steel beam. The <b>material</b> nonlinearities <b>of</b> concrete, <b>headed</b> stud, profiled steel sheeting, reinforcement and steel beam {{were included in the}} finite element model. The capacity of shear connection, load-slip behaviour <b>of</b> the <b>headed</b> stud, and failure modes were predicted. The results obtained from the finite element analysis were verified against experimental results. An extensive parametric study was conducted to study the effects on the capacity and behaviour of shear connection by changing the profiled steel sheeting geometries, the diameter and height <b>of</b> the <b>headed</b> stud, as well as the strength of concrete. The capacities of shear connection obtained from the finite element analysis were compared with the design strengths calculated using the American Specification, British Standard and European Code for headed stud shear connectors in composite slabs with profiled steel sheeting perpendicular to the steel beam. It is found that the design rules specified in the American and British specifications overestimated the capacity of shear connection, but the design rules specified in the European Code were generally conservative. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The long-term consequences could include difficulty in solving problems and deficits in memory and language. Aim: To {{assess the impact of}} a professional adult soccer ball on a child´s head, using the finite element method and dynamic effects to predict brain damage. Material and Methods: The minimum conditions of an adult game were considered: the ball speed was 6 m/s and the diffuse blow was 345 and 369 Newtons (N), on the forehead and top <b>of</b> the <b>head,</b> respectively. A head was modeled in order to know the stresses, strains and displacements generated by the impacts. The extent of the alteration was determined by comparing the strength of brain tissue, with predictions of computed stresses. The geometric characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>head</b> were transferred from medical images. The input data <b>of</b> the <b>materials</b> <b>of</b> a child´s <b>head</b> was obtained from the literature. Results: In the case <b>of</b> <b>heading</b> with the forehead, mathematical simulation showed frontal lobe alterations, with brain stresses between 0. 064 and 0. 059 N/mm 2. When the heading was with the upper head zone, the brain alterations were in the parietal lobe, with stresses between 0. 089 and 0. 067 N/mm². In the cerebral spinal fluid the pressure was 3. 61 to 3. 24 N/mm 2. Conclusions: The mathematical simulations reveal evidence of brain alterations caused by a child heading adult soccer balls.
