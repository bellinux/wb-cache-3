40|$|Numerous spills {{over the}} years have {{demonstrated}} that mechanical response to high viscosity oil spills at sea is less than successful. After the 10, 000 m 3 ERIKA Spill in France, less than 5 % was recovered before the oil reached the coast. The weather played an important role, but the selection of equipment and apparent response strategy did as well. Mainly weir skimmers were used. Weir skimmers are due to their simplicity and reliability widely used in spills at sea. Probably because some of the well known brands are equipped with heavy oil transfer pumps, they are even commonly attempted used in heavy oil spills. But also high capacity units with light oil centrifugal transfer pumps are being used on heavy oil (ERIKA). However, weir skimmers start losing their efficiency when the viscosity of the oil exceeds certain limits. It gets too difficult for the oil to pass the weir lip and flow into the hopper, so that the pump can transfer it. For very heavy oils, which barely can float, the inlet weir becomes an even larger obstruction. A <b>mechanical</b> <b>feeder</b> skimmer lifts or drags the oil out of the water to a position above the water surface, and feeds or drops it into a collection tank or a transfer pump. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>feeder</b> principle may result in significantly increased performance regarding high viscosity, debris, and- i...|$|E
40|$|The high {{incidence}} of Stereotypie behaviors in zoo bears (van Keulen-Kromhout: International Zoo Yearbook 18 : 177 - 186, 1978) suggests that the environment of these animals lacks essential stimuli for guiding normal behavior. Three experi-ments investigated ways in which bear husbandry procedures can be altered to promote normal behavior. In experiments 1 and 2, honey-filled logs were given to a sloth (Melursus ursinas), American black (Ursus americanus), and brown bear (Ursus arctos) to determine 1) the role of food in stimulating investigatory behavior, 2) the rate of habituation to manipulable objects introduced into the exhibit, and 3) effects on locomotory behaviors. Results show specific and gen-eral habituation to the introduced objects that can be counteracted by refilling the logs with honey and by providing multiple logs in the exhibit. Investigatory activity directed toward honey-logs replaces pacing and walking in the sloth bear and is most effective in doing so when the log is novel. Experiment 3 examined the behavioral effects of feeding an American black bear in three different ways: 1) once daily in the den, 2) once daily with supplemental food from a <b>mechanical</b> <b>feeder,</b> and 3) once daily with food hidden in the exhibit in manipulatable objects. The latter method reduced Stereotypie pacing from a median of 150 min/day to 20 min/day; the <b>mechanical</b> <b>feeder</b> method had no such effect. The results of a survey of 67 zoos concerning the diet and manner of feeding these three species of bears, as well as Asian black bears (Ursus thibetanus) are presented.

40|$|The work {{includes}} the mechanical analysis of <b>mechanical</b> <b>feeders</b> and batchers that find application in various technological processes and industrial fields. Feeders are usually classified {{according to their}} design features into two groups: conveyor-type feeders and non-conveyor feeders. Batchers are used to batch solid bulk materials. Less frequently, they are used for liquids. In terms of a batching method, they are divided into volumetric and weighting batchers. Weighting batchers do not provide for sufficient batching accuracy. Automatic weighting batchers include a mass controlling sensor and systems for automatic material feed and automatic mass discharge control. In terms of operating principle, batchers are divided into gravitational batchers and batchers with forced feed of material using conveyors and pumps. Improved consumption of raw materials, decreased loss of materials, ease of use in automatic control systems of industrial facilities allows increasing the quality of technological processes and improve labor conditions. The batch feeder suggested by the authors is a volumetric batcher that has no comparable counterparts among conveyor-type feeders and allows solving the problem of targeted feeding of bulk material batches increasing reliability and hermeticity of the device...|$|R

Here, alumina coatings were produced from sub-micron sized feedstock in aqueous suspension, using two flame combustion parameters yielding contrasting microstructures. Both coatings were tested in dry sliding wear conditions with an alumina counterbody. The coating processed with high combustion power of 101 kW contained 74 wt% amorphous phase and 26 wt% crystalline phase (95 wt% gamma and 3 wt% alpha alumina) while the 72 kW coating contained lower 58 wt% amorphous phase and 42 wt% crystalline phases (73 wt% was alpha and 26 wt % gamma). The 101 kW coating had a dry sliding specific wear rate between 4 - 4. 5 x 10 - 5 mm 3 /Nm, 2 orders of magnitude higher than the 72 kW coating wear rate of 2 - 4. 2 x 10 - 7 mm 3 /Nm. A severe wear regime dominated by brittle fracture and grain pull out of the coating was responsible for the wear of the 101 kW coating, explained by mean fracture toughness three times lower than the 72 kW coating, owing to the almost complete absence of alpha alumina...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} program {{is concerned with}} {{the development of a new}} form of feeder, known as the Stamet Posimetric O High Pressure Solids Feeder, to feed dry granular solids continuously and controllably into gas pressure. The device is a rotary <b>mechanical</b> <b>feeder,</b> which utilizes the interlocking and internal friction of the granular solids to drive the solids through into the outlet pressure in a continuous and controllable way, using a continuous solids material seal on the feeder outlet to control gas leakage. Earlier work sponsored under previous SBIR grants has successfully demonstrated the potential benefits of the Stamet machine over pressurized lock hopper or paste feeder methods. The objective of this project was to demonstrate proof of principal to feed and meter specified granular coal into 450 psig gas pressure for use with next generation pressurized fluidized bed combustors. This report encompasses the development of material transport properties testers, methods to predict feeder performance by calculation, and the modification and testing of Stamet feeders to feed the material supplied into pressure. Testers were made to measure material compressibility, bulk density, both internal and wall friction coefficients, and permeability under typical conditions experienced inside a Stamet high pressure feeder. This data is then used in support of ongoing efforts to develop calculations to predict the performance of Stamet pressure feeders with different materials and conditions. Three Stamet pressure feeders were modified to handle the fine granular or pulverized coal, and were tested under various conditions using different outlet arrangements. The initial testing identified difficulties in handling the fine materials, but through a series of calculations and tests, the issues were overcome and the material was successfully fed into pressure. In all cases the performance calculated based on the measured material properties and feeder geometry agreed well with the test results, confirming the ability to predict performance and select geometry required to handle different conditions. However, the maximum pressure achieved was limited by an ineffective auger design, which was unable to effectively control the length of the outlet seal at higher pressures without imposing additional mechanical loads on the surface of the coal seal. This prevented steady state conditions being maintained long enough to reach the target pressure. Though the specified coal was successfully pumped into pressures over 200 psi, and the test results clearly indicate the changes required to provide a fixed outlet geometry that would achieve the 450 psi target, time and funding was not available to pursue this goal further under this project...|$|E
50|$|Starting {{at the end}} of {{the nineteenth}} century, well before the advent of {{electronic}} computers, data processing was performed using electromechanical machines called unit record equipment, electric accounting machines (EAM) or tabulating machines.Unit record machines came to be as ubiquitous in industry and government in the first two-thirds of the twentieth century as computers became in the last third. They allowed large volume, sophisticated data-processing tasks to be accomplished before electronic computers were invented and while they were still in their infancy. This data processing was accomplished by processing punched cards through various unit record machines in a carefully choreographed progression. This progression, or flow, from machine to machine was often planned and documented with detailed flowcharts that used standardized symbols for documents and the various machine functions. All but the earliest machines had high-speed <b>mechanical</b> <b>feeders</b> to process cards at rates from around 100 to 2,000 per minute, sensing punched holes with mechanical, electrical, or, later, optical sensors. The operation of many machines was directed by the use of a removable plugboard, control panel, or connection box. Initially all machines were manual or electromechanical. The first use of an electronic component was in 1940 when a gas triode vacuum tube replaced a relay in an IBM card sorter. Electronic components were used on other machines beginning in the late 1940s.|$|R

40|$|The {{self-renewal}} and differentiation {{capacities of}} human {{pluripotent stem cells}} (hPSCs) make them a promising source of material for cell transplantation therapy, drug development, and studies of cellular differentiation and development. However, {{the large numbers of}} cells necessary for many of these applications require extensive expansion of hPSC cultures, a process that has been associated with genetic and epigenetic alterations. We have performed a combinatorial study on both hESCs and hiPSCs to compare the effects of enzymatic vs. mechanical passaging, and feeder-free vs. mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder substrate, on the genetic and epigenetic stability and the phenotypic characteristics of hPSCs. In extensive experiments involving over 100 continuous passages, we observed that both enzymatic passaging and feeder-free culture were associated with genetic instability, higher rates of cell proliferation, and persistence of OCT 4 /POU 5 F 1 -positive cells in teratomas, with enzymatic passaging having the stronger effect. In all combinations of culture conditions except for <b>mechanical</b> passaging on <b>feeder</b> layers, we noted recurrent deletions in the genomic region containing the tumor suppressor gene TP 53, which was associated with decreased mRNA expression of TP 53, as well as alterations in the expression of several downstream genes consistent with a decrease in the activity of the TP 53 pathway. Among the hESC cultures, we also observed culture-associated variations in global gene expression and DNA methylation. The effects of enzymatic passaging and feeder-free conditions were also observed in hiPSC cultures.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this project {{is the development of}} a <b>mechanical</b> rotary-disk <b>feeder,</b> known as the Stamet Posimetric High Pressure Solids Feeder System, to demonstrate feeding of dry granular coal continuously and controllably into pressurized environments of up to 70 kg/cm 2 (1, 000 psi). This is the Phase III of the ongoing program. Earlier Phases 1 and II successfully demonstrated feeding into pressures up to 35 kg/cm{sup 2 } (500 psi). The final report for those phases was submitted in April 2005. Based on the previous work done in Phases I & II using Powder River Basin coal provided by the PSDF facility in Wilsonville, AL, a Phase III feeder system was designed and built to accomplish the target of feeding the coal into a pressure of 70 kg/cm 2 (1, 000 psi) and to be capable of feed rates of up to 550 kilograms (1, 200 lbs) per hour. The drive motor system from Phase II was retained for use on Phase III since projected performance calculations indicated it should be capable of driving the Phase III pump to the target levels. The pump & motor system was installed in a custom built test rig comprising an inlet vessel containing an active live-wall hopper mounted on weigh cells in a support frame, transition into the pump inlet, transition from pump outlet and a receiver vessel containing a receiver drum supported on weigh cells. All pressure containment on the rig was rated to 105 kg/cm{sup 2 } (1, 500 psi) to accommodate the final pressure requirement of a proposed Phase IV of the program. A screw conveyor and batch hopper were added to transfer coal at atmospheric pressure from the shop floor up into the test rig to enable continuous feeding up to the capacity of the receiving vessel. Control & monitoring systems were up-rated from the Phase II system to cover the additional features incorporated in the Phase III rig, and provide closer control and expanded monitoring of the entire system. A program of testing and modification was carried out in Stamet's facility in CA, culminating in the first successful feeding of coal into the Phase III target of 70 kg/cm{sup 2 } (1, 000 psi) gas pressure in March 2007.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this project {{is the development of}} a <b>mechanical</b> rotary-disk <b>feeder,</b> known as the Stamet Posimetric High Pressure Solids Feeder System, to feed dry granular coal continuously and controllably into pressurized environments of up to 35 kg/cm{sup 2 } (500 psi). This was to be accomplished in two phases. The first task was to review materials handling experience in pressurized operations as it related to the target pressures for this project, and review existing coal preparation processes and specifications currently used in advanced combustion systems. Samples of existing fuel materials were obtained and tested to evaluate flow, sealing and friction properties. This provided input data for use {{in the design of the}} Stamet Feeders for the project, and ensured that the material specification used met the requirements of advanced combustion & gasification systems. Ultimately, Powder River Basin coal provided by the PSDF facility in Wilsonville, AL was used as the basis for the feeder design and test program. Based on the material property information, a Phase 1 feeder system was designed and built to accomplish feeding the coal to an intermediate pressure up to 21 kg/cm{sup 2 } (300 psi) at feed rates of approximately 100 kilograms (220 lbs) per hour. The pump & motor system was installed in a custom built test rig comprising an inlet vessel containing an active live-wall hopper mounted in a support frame, transition into the pump inlet, transition from pump outlet and a receiver vessel containing a receiver drum supported on weigh cells. All pressure containment on the rig was rated for the final pressure requirement of 35 kg/cm{sup 2 } (500 psi). A program of testing and modification was carried out in Stamet's facility in CA, culminating in successful feeding of coal into the Phase 1 target of 21 kg/cm{sup 2 } (300 psi) gas pressure in December 2003. Further testing was carried out at CQ Inc's facility in PA, providing longer run times and experience of handling and feeding the coal in winter conditions. Based on the data developed through the testing of the Phase I unit, a Phase II system was designed for feeding coal into pressures of up to 35 kg/cm{sup 2 } (500 psi). A further program of testing and modification was then carried out in Stamet's facility, with the target pressure being achieved in January 2005.

A computerised tank-based waste pellet monitoring system was developed and used to study feeding rhythms in greenback flounder. It consisted of an infrared sensor and a recording unit capable of continuously detecting wastage with reference to time. Actual feed intake was determined as the difference between pellets presented by a <b>mechanical</b> belt <b>feeder</b> and the uneaten pellets detected by the monitoring system. Diel feeding rhythms were described by the temporal variation of actual feed intake at intervals of 30 mm. The role of light-dark (LD) cycles and food deprivation in the regulation of diel feeding rhythms in greenback flounder (75 - 281 g) was examined. The fish is a diurnal feeder, but is capable of feeding at night. Feeding appeared to have an endogenous circadian component. A LD 12 : 12 cycle was a potent environmental cue to entrain circadian feeding rhythms. Re-feeding after a single period of food deprivation of 26 - 57 h was capable of temporarily over-riding feeding rhythms. The effect of feeding regime (difference in temporal distribution of feed) on growth and proximate body composition was investigated. The feeding regimes {{had an impact on the}} growth, with 1 meal of 3 h during the scotophase resulting in lower growth than the other five feeding regimes (feed continuously available, 12 meals of 1 h per meal, 6 meals of 1 h per meal, 3 meals of 2 h per meal, and 1 meal of 3 h during the photophase). However, the feeding regimes did not significantly influence proximate body composition. Locomotor activity patterns were examined in relation to feeding regimes and combinations of meal size and meal duration at a single daily meal. Groups assigned to a higher frequency (and hence a longer total duration) of daily meals were less active during mealtime even though the daily ration was equivalent as percentage of body weight per day. A distinct food anticipatory activity (FAA) was observed in the groups of fish receiving a single daily meal either during photophase or during scotophase, and FAA also developed before at least one out of three daily meals but not before any meal in the regimes of six daily meals or more than six daily meals. It was further demonstrated that whether or not a single daily meal is a potent zeitgeber to synchronise daily locomotor activity pattern depends on the combination of meal size and meal duration. The fish fed at the meal sizes of 0. 25 and 0. 5...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent times}} the {{presence}} of vision and robotic systems in industry has become common place, {{but in spite of}} many achievements a large range of industrial tasks still remain unsolved {{due to the lack of}} flexibility of the vision systems when dealing with highly adaptive manufacturing environments. An important task found across a broad range of modern flexible manufacturing environments is the need to present parts to automated machinery from a supply bin. In order to carry out grasping and manipulation operations safely and efficiently we need to know the identity, location and spatial orientation of the objects that lie in an unstructured heap in a bin. Historically, the bin picking problem was tackled using <b>mechanical</b> vibratory <b>feeders</b> where the vision feedback was unavailable. This solution has certain problems with parts jamming and more important they are highly dedicated. In this regard if a change in the manufacturing process is required, the changeover may include an extensive re-tooling and a total revision of the system control strategy (Kelley et al., 1982). Due to these disadvantages modern bin picking systems perform grasping and manipulation operations using vision feedback (Yoshimi & Allen, 1994). Vision based robotic bin picking has been the subject of research since the introduction of the automated vision controlled processes in industry and a review of existing systems indicates that none of the proposed solutions were able to solve this classic vision problem in its generality. One of the main challenges facing such a bin picking system is its ability to deal with overlapping objects. The object recognition in cluttered scenes is the main objective of these systems and early approaches attempted to perform bin picking operations for similar objects that are jumbled together in an unstructured heap using no knowledge about the pose or geometry of the parts (Birk et al., 1981). While these assumptions may be acceptable for a restricted number of applications, in most practical cases a flexible system must deal with more than one type of object with a wide scale of shapes. A flexible bin picking system has to address three difficult problems: scene interpretation, object recognition and pose estimation. Initial approaches to these tasks were based on modeling parts using the 2 D surface representations. Typical 2 D representations include invariant shape descriptors (Zisserman et al., 1994), algebraic curves (Tarel & Cooper, 2000), 2 Name of the book (Header position 1, 5) conics (Bolles & Horaud, 1986; Forsyth et al., 1991) and appearance based models (Murase & Nayar, 1995; Ohba & Ikeuchi, 1997). These systems are generally better suited to planar object recognition and they are not able to deal with severe viewpoint distortions or objects with complex shapes/textures. Also the spatial orientation cannot be robustly estimated for objects with free-form contours. To address this limitation most bin picking systems attempt to recognize the scene objects and estimate their spatial orientation using the 3 D information (Fan et al., 1989; Faugeras & Hebert, 1986). Notable approaches include the use of 3 D local descriptors (Ansar & Daniilidis, 2003; Campbell & Flynn, 2001; Kim & Kak, 1991), polyhedra (Rothwell & Stern, 1996), generalized cylinders (Ponce et al., 1989; Zerroug & Nevatia, 1996), super-quadrics (Blane et al., 2000) and visual learning methods (Johnson & Hebert, 1999; Mittrapiyanuruk et al., 2004). The most difficult problem for 3 D bin picking systems that are based on a structural description of the objects (local descriptors or 3 D primitives) is the complex procedure required to perform the scene to model feature matching. This procedure is usually based on complex graph-searching techniques and is increasingly more difficult when dealing with object occlusions, a situation when the structural description of the scene objects is incomplete. Visual learning methods based on eigenimage analysis have been proposed as an alternative solution to address the object recognition and pose estimation for objects with complex appearances. In this regard, Johnson and Hebert (Johnson & Hebert, 1999) developed an object recognition scheme that is able to identify multiple 3 D objects in scenes affected by clutter and occlusion. They proposed an eigenimage analysis approach that is applied to match surface points using the spin image representation. The main attraction of this approach resides in the use of spin images that are local surface descriptors; hence they can be easily identified in real scenes that contain clutter and occlusions. This approach returns accurate results but the pose estimation cannot be inferred, as the spin images are local descriptors and they are not robust to capture the object orientation. In general the pose sampling for visual learning methods is a problem difficult to solve as the numbers of views required to sample the full 6 degree of freedom for object pose is prohibitive. This issue was addressed in the paper by Edwards (Edwards, 1996) when he applied eigenimage analysis to a one-object scene and his approach was able to estimate the pose only in cases where the tilt angle was limited to 30 degrees with respect to the optical axis of the sensor. In this chapter we describe the implementation of a vision sensor for robotic bin picking where we attempt to eliminate the main problem faced by the visual learning methods, namely the pose sampling problem. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the overall system. Section 3 describes the implementation of the range sensor while Section 4 details the edge-based segmentation algorithm. Section 5 presents the viewpoint correction algorithm that is applied to align the detected object surfaces perpendicular on the optical axis of the sensor. Section 6 describes the object recognition algorithm. This is followed in Section 7 by an outline of the pose estimation algorithm. Section 8 presents a number of experimental results illustrating the benefits of the approach outlined in this chapter...|$|R
