40|$|Abstract Workplaces {{with good}} {{daylighting}} offer visual comfort to users, {{give them a}} series of physiological and psychological benefits and allow good performance of visual activities, besides saving energy. However, this solution is not always adopted: lighting type preferences involve many variables besides the availability of daylight. This paper explores a case study through the analysis of questionnaire answers and computer simulations {{of a series of}} metrics related to quality of lighting with the aim of finding explanations for the lighting preferences of individual office users. The results show that, although the offices present good daylighting conditions and no glare potential, and users are satisfied with daylighting, these parameters are not sufficient to explain the predominant lighting preferences. The findings have also shown that there is no consensus about which parameters potentially cause visual comfort, while the parameters that cause discomfort are clearly identified. In addition, in this study, 49 % of the preference for <b>mixed</b> <b>lighting</b> (daylight plus electrical light) {{can be explained by the}} fact that <b>mixed</b> <b>lighting</b> produces better modeling than daylighting alone...|$|E
40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} {{of white}} balance technique can handle photos taken under <b>mixed</b> <b>lighting,</b> such as indoor/outdoor or flash/ambient light types. However, {{the cost for}} the faithful result is the long CPU time that precludes interaction on personal computers. In this paper, we use commodity graphics processors (GPUs) to accelerate the light mixture estimation for spatially varying white balance. Our implementation on an NVIDIA G 80 GPU achieves a performance improvement of around 30 X over the dual-thread CPU-based counterpart. Our method enables fast photo white balance at digital home, and {{can also be used}} to accelerate pattern recognition and matting applications. © 2009 Binary Information Press...|$|E

40|$|White {{balance is}} a crucial step in the {{photographic}} pipeline. It ensures the proper rendition of images by eliminating color casts due to differing illuminants. Digital cameras and editing programs provide white balance tools that assume a single type of light per image, such as daylight. However, many photos are taken under <b>mixed</b> <b>lighting.</b> We propose a white balance technique for scenes with two light types that are specified by the user. This covers many typical situations involving indoor/outdoor or flash/ambient light mixtures. Since we work from a single image, the problem is highly underconstrained. Our method recovers a set of dominant material colors which allows us to estimate the local intensity mixture of the two light types. Using this mixture, we can neutralize the light colors and render visually pleasing images. Our method {{can also be used}} to achieve post-exposure relighting effects...|$|E

Traditional white balance (b) produces unnatural results because it cannot deal with spatially varying light color.
