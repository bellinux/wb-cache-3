5|$|Despite {{the widely}} held {{view that the}} authors of the Synoptic Gospels drew upon each other (the {{so-called}} synoptic problem), other scholars take it as significant that the virgin birth is attested by two separate gospels, <b>Matthew</b> <b>and</b> Luke.|$|E

30|$|<b>Matthews</b> <b>and</b> Yeung (2000) {{examined}} the variation between VO and OV word orders in another Chinese language, Cantonese, with a reading experiment. They found a processing advantage for OV sentences over the VO counterparts when the object NP was heavy, i.e., containing a relative clause that modifies the N head. <b>Matthews</b> <b>and</b> Yeung attributed the processing {{advantage to the}} shortened PCD of the verb phrase in OV word order. It {{should be noted that}} the preverbal stimuli <b>Matthews</b> <b>and</b> Yeung’s study were all OSV sentences and did not include the ba construction, although Cantonese shares a similar jiang construction. Thus, the analysis in (9) does not apply to <b>Matthews</b> <b>and</b> Yeung’s study, neither does <b>Matthews</b> <b>and</b> Yeung’s analysis apply to the current study.|$|R
5|$|In Mark, {{the disciples}} play hardly any role {{other than a}} {{negative}} one. While others sometimes respond to Jesus with complete faith, his disciples are puzzled and doubtful. They serve as a foil to Jesus and to other characters. The failings of the disciples are probably exaggerated in Mark, and the disciples make a better showing in <b>Matthew</b> <b>and</b> Luke.|$|E
5|$|<b>Matthew</b> <b>and</b> Brown also {{described}} a fifth skeleton (AMNH 5664), which Charles H. Sternberg had collected in 1917 {{and sold to}} their museum. It was smaller than other Gorgosaurus specimens, with a lower, lighter skull and more elongate limb proportions. Many sutures between bones were unfused in this specimen as well. <b>Matthew</b> <b>and</b> Brown noted that these features were characteristic of juvenile tyrannosaurids, but still described it as the holotype of a new species, G. sternbergi. Today's paleontologists regard this specimen as a juvenile G. libratus. Dozens of other specimens have been excavated from the Dinosaur Park Formation and are housed in museums across the United States and Canada. G. libratus is the best-represented tyrannosaurid in the fossil record, known from a virtually complete growth series.|$|E
5|$|According to E. P. Sanders, {{the birth}} {{narratives}} in <b>Matthew</b> <b>and</b> Luke are the clearest case of invention in the Gospel narratives of Jesus' life. Both accounts have Jesus born in Bethlehem, {{in accordance with}} Jewish salvation history, and both have him growing up in Nazareth. But Sanders points that the two Gospels report completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened. Luke's account of a census in which everyone returned to their ancestral cities is not plausible. Matthew's account is more plausible, but the story reads {{as though it was}} invented to identify Jesus as like a new Moses, and the historian Josephus reports Herod the Great's brutality without ever mentioning that he massacred little boys.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, the American palaeontologists Walter Granger and William K. Gregory {{proposed}} that Forster-Cooper's Baluchitherium osborni was likely a junior synonym (an invalid {{name for the}} same taxon) of Paraceratherium bugtiense, because these specimens were collected at the same locality and were possibly {{part of the same}} morphologically variable species. William Diller <b>Matthew</b> <b>and</b> Forster-Cooper himself had expressed similar doubts few years earlier. Although it had already been declared a junior synonym, the genus name Baluchitherium remained popular in various media because of the publicity surrounding Osborn's B. grangeri.|$|E

5|$|In his Commentary on Matthew, however, Origen {{offered a}} {{different}} approach. Answering criticisms {{that there was}} no mention of this incident in any of the many non-Christian sources, he insisted that it was local to Palestine, and therefore would have gone unnoticed outside. To suggestions it was merely an eclipse, Origen pointed out that this was impossible and suggested other explanations, such as heavy clouds, drawing only on the accounts given in <b>Matthew</b> <b>and</b> Mark, which make no mention of the sun.|$|E
5|$|<b>Matthew</b> <b>and</b> Luke each {{describe}} Jesus' nativity (or birth), {{especially that}} Jesus was born by a virgin Mary in Bethlehem in fulfillment of prophecy. Luke's account emphasizes events {{before the birth}} of Jesus and centers on Mary, while Matthew's mostly covers those after the birth and centers on Joseph. Both accounts state that Jesus was born to Joseph and Mary, his betrothed, in Bethlehem, and both support {{the doctrine of the}} virgin birth of Jesus, according to which Jesus was miraculously conceived by the Holy Spirit in Mary's womb when she was still a virgin.|$|E

After meeting up with Kraden, Rief, and Nowell, they are ambushed by villains Blados, Chalis, and Arcanus and the party is separated. As Matthew's party travels across Weyard to reunite with Kraden and Nowell, they encounter a deadly eclipse heralded by the lighting of Luna Tower, causing suffering and destruction across the world. They manage to activate an ancient machine known as the Apollo's Lens to end the eclipse, and return home to discover a large Psynergy Vortex sitting ominously near their home.|$|E
5|$|The holotype of Gorgosaurus libratus (NMC 2120) is {{a nearly}} {{complete}} skeleton {{associated with a}} skull, discovered in 1913 by Charles M. Sternberg. This specimen was the first tyrannosaurid found with a complete hand. It {{was found in the}} Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta and is housed in the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa. Prospectors from the American Museum of Natural History in New York City were active along the Red Deer River in Alberta at the same time, collecting hundreds of spectacular dinosaur specimens, including four complete G. libratus skulls, three of which were associated with skeletons. <b>Matthew</b> <b>and</b> Brown described four of these specimens in 1923.|$|E
5|$|William Etty {{was born}} in Feasegate, York, on 10March 1787, the seventh child of <b>Matthew</b> <b>and</b> Esther Etty, née Calverley.

Esther Calverley's brother unexpectedly inherited the title of Squire of Hayton in 1745, nine years before Esther's birth, but disowned her following her marriage to Matthew as he considered him beneath her station. The family were strict Methodists and the young William was raised as such, although he disliked the spartan appearance of the Methodist chapel and liked to attend his Anglican parish church or York Minster when able.|$|E

It was once {{thought that he had}} in fact founded the Waldensians, however this was disproved in the 19th century. His epistles on 1 and 2 Corinthians, however, dedicated to Theodemir, abbot of Psalmody, and a possible student of his, were sent to Aachen by the dedicatee to be condemned by the assembled bishops of the realm. The Corinthian commentaries were unpublished, though it was these commentaries that sparked the controversy concerning icons and pilgrimages.|$|E
5|$|Glencross {{was born}} December 28, 1982, in Kindersley, Saskatchewan, but {{grew up in}} Provost, Alberta. He {{is the son of}} Mel and Robin Glencross, and has a younger brother, <b>Matthew,</b> <b>and</b> sister, Kari. His parents both played hockey and say he {{inherited}} an intense competitive nature from them. His family moved to Red Deer, Alberta when he was a teenager as his parents began a livestock auction business. Glencross was small for his age, standing less than five feet tall when he was15, and as a result was often left off the top teams in minor hockey despite having the talent to play; he played Midget C hockey in Provost. He experienced a rapid growth spurt, growing a full foot in a period of 17months, and was recruited to play Junior A hockey for the expansion Brooks Bandits of the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL) in 2000. He {{went on to become the}} first Bandit alumnus to play in the National Hockey League (NHL), and his number 17 was retired by the team in 2011.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, Joseph Leidy {{described}} two tyrannosaurid premaxillary teeth from Montana. Although {{there was}} no indication of what the animal looked like, the teeth were large and robust, and Leidy gave them the name Deinodon. <b>Matthew</b> <b>and</b> Brown commented in 1922 that these teeth were indistinguishable from those of Gorgosaurus, but in the absence of skeletal remains of Deinodon, opted not to unequivocally synonymize the two genera, provisionally naming a ?Deinodon libratus. Although Deinodon teeth are very similar to those of Gorgosaurus, tyrannosaurid teeth are extremely uniform, so it cannot be said for certain which animal they belonged to. Deinodon is usually regarded as a nomen dubium today. Additional likely synonyms of G. libratus and/or D. horridus include Laelaps falculus, Laelaps hazenianus, Laelaps incrassatus, and Dryptosaurus kenabekides.|$|E
