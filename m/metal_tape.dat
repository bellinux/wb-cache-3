25|$|The most {{promising}} method developed to utilize this material involves deposition of YBCO on flexible metal tapes coated with buffering metal oxides. This {{is known as}} coated conductor. Texture (crystal plane alignment) can be introduced into the <b>metal</b> <b>tape</b> itself (the RABiTS process) or a textured ceramic buffer layer can be deposited, {{with the aid of}} an ion beam, on an untextured alloy substrate (the IBAD process). Subsequent oxide layers prevent diffusion of the metal from the tape into the superconductor while transferring the template for texturing the superconducting layer. Novel variants on CVD, PVD, and solution deposition techniques are used to produce long lengths of the final YBCO layer at high rates. Companies pursuing these processes include American Superconductor, Superpower (a division of Furukawa Electric), Sumitomo, Fujikura, Nexans Superconductors, and European Advanced Superconductors. A much larger number of research institutes have also produced YBCO tape by these methods.|$|E

50|$|The UNISERVO used metal tape: a 1/2 in {{thin strip}} of {{nickel-plated}} phosphor bronze (called Vicalloy) 1200 feet long. These <b>metal</b> <b>tape</b> reels were very heavy. Data {{was recorded in}} eight channels on the tape (six for the data value, one parity channel for error checking, and one timing channel) at a density of 128 bits per inch. The tape could be moved at 100 inches per second, giving a nominal transfer rate of 12,800 characters per second. Data were recorded in fixed size blocks of 60 words of 12 characters each. Making allowance for the empty space between tape blocks, the actual transfer rate was around 7,200 characters per second.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic {{tape was}} first used to record {{computer}} data in 1951 on the Eckert-Mauchly UNIVAC I. The UNISERVO drive recording medium was a thin metal strip of 0.5 in wide nickel-plated phosphor bronze. Recording density was 128 characters per inch (198 micrometre/character) on eight tracks at a linear speed of 100 in/s m/s, yielding a data rate of 12,800 characters per second. Of the eight tracks, six were data, one was a parity track, and one was a clock, or timing track. Making allowance for the empty space between tape blocks, the actual transfer rate was around 7,200 characters per second. A small reel of mylar tape provided separation from the <b>metal</b> <b>tape</b> and the read/write head.|$|E
50|$|While at Argonne National Laboratory Goertz {{developed}} the master-slave manipulator {{in order to}} safely handle hazardous material from the 100-B plutonium reactor at Hanford. The initial master-slave manipulator device was designed by Goertz in 1948 as a seven-degree-of-freedom bilateral (symmetrical) <b>metal</b> <b>tape</b> transmission pantograph device, which was operated through a leaded glass wall. In 1949 Goertz filed a patent for a mechanical, bilateral master-slave manipulator, and in 1951 Goertz improved upon this design with the first tel-operated articulated arm with a design that relied on mechanical coupling between the master and slave arms through the utilization of steel pulleys and cables. This was a major milestone in force feedback technology and derivatives of this design are still seen today.|$|E
50|$|UNIVAC {{continued}} to use the name UNISERVO for later models of tape drive (e.g., UNISERVO II, UNISERVO IIIC, UNISERVO VIII-C) for later computers in their product line. The UNISERVO II could read <b>metal</b> <b>tapes</b> from the UNIVAC I as well as use higher density PET film base/ferric oxide media tapes that became the industry standard. While UNIVAC was first with computer tape, and had higher performance than contemporary IBM tape drives, IBM was able to set the data interchange standard. UNIVAC was later forced to be compatible with the IBM technology.|$|R

The Selectric used a system of latches, <b>metal</b> <b>tapes,</b> and pulleys driven by an electric motor to rotate {{the ball into the}} correct position and then strike it against the ribbon and platen.
