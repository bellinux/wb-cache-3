2500|$|Prior to the {{outbreak}} of the war, the Abkhaz leadership arranged for the redeployment of a Russian airborne battalion from the Baltic states to Sukhumi. According to the Russian historian Svetlana Mikhailovna Chervonnaya, a number of Russian security servicemen also arrived in Abkhazia as [...] "tourists" [...] during that summer: [...] "The <b>main</b> <b>load</b> in the preparation of Abkhazian events was given to staff of the former KGB. Almost all of them got appointments in Abkhazia under cover of neutral establishments, which {{had nothing to do with}} their real activities. To distract attention, various ruses were resorted to, such as the private exchange of apartments, or the necessity of moving one’s place of work to Abkhazia due to a sudden deterioration of health." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because of what {{happened}} in Quebec in the winter of 1998, Hydro-Quebec TransEnergie created a De-icing machine to insure that another event like this wouldn't happen again. The De-icer is a [...] machine that runs a high direct current (DC) into a selected transmission line in order to melt the ice on it. However, because the operation in this mode may be very infrequent, when the installation is not being used as a De-icer it is used as a Static Var Compensator, SVC for short, by using the HVDC valves as a Thyristor Controlled Reactor. An innovative design is used, minimizing the power losses of the valves in SVC mode. The reason an AC current wasn't used is because AC current requires a lot of reactive support. It would take a much higher amount of voltage to push the necessary current through the line.The high voltage system in Quebec runs in two transmission corridors, one high voltage system runs in the north-west from the <b>main</b> <b>load</b> centres of Montreal and Quebec and the other runs north-east along the Saint-Lawrence river. It is the latter corridor that is mainly in an area prone to ice storms that deposit ice on the transmission lines.|$|E
5000|$|In a structure, {{the main}} {{portion of the}} load is {{transferred}} through the stiffest route. The U* index represents the internal stiffness of every point within the structure. Consequently, the line connecting the highest U* values is the <b>main</b> <b>load</b> path. In other words, the <b>main</b> <b>load</b> path is the ridge line of the U* distribution (contour). [...] The U* index theory has been validated through two different physical experiments.|$|E

5000|$|Load path {{analysis}} may be performed using {{the concept of}} a load transfer index, U*.. In a structure, the main portion of the load is transferred through the stiffest route.

50|$|A {{station wagon}} version was {{introduced}} in 1958. It was known by various names in different markets (Break in France, Safari and Estate in the UK, Wagon in the US, and Citroën Australia used the terms Safari and Station-Wagon). It had a steel roof to support the standard roof rack. 'Familiales' had a rear seat mounted further back in the cabin, with three folding seats between {{the front and rear}} squabs. The standard Break had two side-facing seats in the <b>main</b> <b>load</b> area at the back.|$|E
50|$|In {{the image}} to the right, a {{structural}} member with a central hole is placed under load bearing stress. Figure (a) shows the U* distribution and the resultant load paths while figure (b) is the von Mises Stress distribution. As {{can be seen from}} figure (b), higher stresses can be observed at the vicinity of the hole. However, it is unreasonable to conclude the <b>main</b> <b>load</b> passes that area with stress concentration because the hole (which has no material) is not important for carrying the load. The stress concentration caused by the structural singularities like a hole or a notch makes the load transfer analysis more difficult.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} is concrete and composite. A central core acts as main horizontal stiffening and resisting element. Foundations are of mixed raft and piles type, where the piles {{are used as}} settlement reduction devices. The base raft is a 2,5 m thick concrete slab, resting on 64 piles arranged in clusters and points under the <b>main</b> <b>load</b> points. In order to resis the main torsional effects due to the warped column arrangement, the core lintels above main doors feature composite solutions with a mixed use of steel elements, rebar and concrete. Due to the specific form-dependent deformation effects, a highly sophisticated stage analysis both for construction and long term effects has been effected. A steel, free form podium for commercial use surrounds {{the base of the}} building.|$|E

40|$|Background. Occlusal splints are {{nowadays}} {{commonly used}} in dentistry to treat symptoms of myoarthropathies of the masticatory system, but also to treat simple occlusal parafunctions. Still, the exact mechanism by which the treatment works is unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to find out the answers to following questions: 1. is there an immediate change of the minimum condyle-fossa distance and accompanying disc thickness by inserting a Michigan splint and 2. is it possible to displace the <b>main</b> <b>loading</b> area on the disc by inserting a Michigan splint? Methods. For each subject and each temporomandibular joint (TMJ), four magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) recordings were taken in the following situations: maximum intercuspation without/with Michigan splint, maximum protrusion without/with Michigan splint (splint 3 mm). The image stacks were reconstructed to three-dimensional virtual models using the Amira™ software. Several measurements were taken on these models and subsequently compared within and across the subjects. Results. No significant change in the global minimum condyle-fossa distance could be achieved by inserting a Michigan splint. However, in most TMJs (18 out of 20) a shift of the <b>main</b> <b>loading</b> area (the area with the smallest joint space) could be observed. This effect could cause an unloading of the otherwise most loaded zone. The intensities of MR images within the discs did not differ significantly intraindividually, thus indicating that all discs were segmented in the same way and were comparable. Most subjects (8 of 10) reached a more anterior condylar position during protrusion with inserted splint compared to the situation without splint. Conclusion. With this method, no increase of the overall minimum TMJ space due to the sole insertion of a Michigan splint could be demonstrated, however a shift of the <b>main</b> <b>loading</b> area could be shown...|$|R
25|$|The advent {{during the}} mid twentieth century of the cavity wall saw the popularisation and {{development}} of another method of strengthening brickwork—the wall tie. A cavity wall comprises two totally discrete walls, separated by an air gap, which serves both as barrier to moisture and heat. Typically the <b>main</b> <b>loads</b> taken by the foundations are carried there by the inner leaf, and the major functions of the external leaf are to protect the whole from weather, {{and to provide a}} fitting aesthetic finish.|$|R

50|$|The {{railways}} {{based on}} the Ewing System are basically monorails using a balancing wheel for balancing the train. The <b>main</b> <b>load</b> (almost 95%) is borne by the single rail while the rest is borne by the balancing wheel which runs on the ground. Further, in normal train systems, the rails {{have to be at}} almost exact level of other rail, failing which the train may go off the tracks. By using Ewing system, this problem is solved as the balancing wheel does not need exact level to maintain the balance of monorail. In addition the cost of laying tracks also goes down considerably since only one rail is used. Another benefit of using Ewing System was that the balancing wheel could run on existing tarred roads as well as the macadam roads thus further reducing cost to lay down tracks.|$|E
5000|$|The LH.70 was {{powered by}} three [...] Lorraine 9Na Algol nine {{cylinder}} radial engines with narrow chord ring cowlings. Two were {{mounted on the}} undersides of the wings with full-chord nacelles behind them. The third engine was on {{the nose of the}} fuselage, which was in three rectangular section parts, built around four longerons and skinned with longitudinally corrugated duralumin. The forward part included the engine mountings and the enclosed cabin just ahead of the wing, seating the pilots side-by-side with dual controls. Behind that was the <b>main</b> <b>load</b> carrying space, up to 2.0 m high, accessed via a port side, obliquely hinged door just aft of the wing trailing edge and lit by a strip of small rectangular windows under the wing. The final part, which had a sloping underside, provided an open dorsal cockpit for an observer and reached back to the tail. There were three fuel tanks, one under the pilots' cabin and two {{in the rear of the}} wings.|$|E
