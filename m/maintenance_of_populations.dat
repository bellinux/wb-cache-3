50|$|Measuring {{ecosystem}} health requires extensive goal-driven environmental sampling. For example, {{a vision for}} {{ecosystem health}} of Lake Superior was developed by a public forum {{and a series of}} objectives were prepared for protection of habitat and <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>populations</b> of some 70 indigenous fish species. A suite of 80 lake health indicators was developed for the Great Lakes Basin including monitoring native fish species, exotic species, water levels, phosphorus levels, toxic chemicals, phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish tissue contaminants, etc. Some authors have attempted broad definitions of ecosystem health, such as benchmarking as healthy the historical ecosystem state “prior to the onset of anthropogenic stress.” A difficulty is that the historical composition of many human-altered ecosystems is unknown or unknowable. Also, fossil and pollen records indicate that the species that occupy an ecosystem reshuffle through time, so it is difficult to identify one snapshot in time as optimum or “healthy.”.|$|E

If we rely entirely on tree-ring and other historical approaches without considering the needs of fire-dependent plants and animals to determine what constitutes a natural fire regime, we run the risk of producing forest conditions that lead to decreases in, rather than the <b>maintenance</b> <b>of,</b> <b>populations</b> of native fire-dependent species.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} salmon to home {{accurately}} to their natal stream to spawn has long intrigued biologists and has important {{consequences for the}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>population</b> structure in these species. It is known that olfaction is crucial to homing, and that {{the transition from the}} freshwater to the marine environment (the parr–smolt transformation; PST) is a period of increased olfactory sensitivity and learning, resulting in a permanent memory of natal site odours that is retained, at least in part, in peripheral sensory neurones. These odours are then used as cues by sexually maturing fish on their homeward migration. We used quantitative polymerase chain reaction techniques to demonstrate transient increases in expression of odorant receptor transcripts (of up to fifty-fold over pre-PST levels) coincident with PST. Both olfactory (SORB) and vomeronasal receptors (SVRA and SVRC) are involved, which suggests that the fish learn both environmental odours and semiochemicals (pheromones). Receptor expression varies between families and changes over time indicating both genetic differences in odour stimuli and multiple periods of olfactory sensitivity. We suggest that changes in OR gene expression may have a role in homing behaviour and thus the <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>population</b> structure in Atlantic salmo...|$|R

We illustrate the case of Gastrodia similis Bosser, a small terrestrial orchid endemic to the lowland rainforest of Reunion island. Despite some very specific ecological requirements (necessary mycorrhizal symbiosis with wood-decay fungi and pollination by specialized drosophilid flies), the populations of this rare species are spreading beneath some secondary forests growing at low altitude, extending northward the species geographical distribution. Other native species might also restore populations in this place. We call for more biodiversity assessments and experimental trials in these hybrid ecosystems. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

Earlier views of bryophytes as being ‘evolutionary failures’ are being questioned since the discovery of high genetic variability in those species and populations which have been studied. At the same time, there is growing evidence that in many taxa the <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>populations</b> is almost completely dependent on asexual propagation; sexual reproduction may result in an enormous spore output, but establishment from spores in the field seems to be very difficult.

40|$|International audienceIn this study, using capture-mark-recapture (CMR), {{a common}} vole {{population}} was monitored {{for one year}} in an experimental study site dominated by meadows, in which field management followed a gradient of intensiveness. The aim was to estimate the demographic response to agricultural practices of the common vole. During the spring, the numbers captured were highest in the most intensively managed plots. After cereal harvesting, they were higher in meadows with the highest nitrogen input. No difference in survival was found among treatments. However, the pattern of transitions suggested that high mobility explained this result. Also, mechanical interventions like ploughing appeared to have powerful consequences for common vole survival.

For both males and females, amylase activity was inhibited by the diet stress, whereas trypsin activity was not influenced. These results underline similar sensitivity of males and females concerning their digestive capacity. Energy reserves decreased with food starvation in females, and remained stable in males. The number of embryos per female decreased with food starvation. Lower digestive activity in males and females therefore appears as an early response.

40|$|The {{relative}} {{contribution of}} sexual and asexual recruitment to the <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>populations</b> of the mushroom coral.

Conversely, asexual recruits (buds) were produced after disturbances, but their rates of recruitment, growth and survival varied dramatically under the different regimes of disturbance. Asexual recruitment was higher under conditions of chronic sedimentation and frequent-acute disturbances, but survival was very low; whereas, asexual recruitment was lowest following an acute bleaching event, but survival was highest during the calm period that followed. Consequently, asexual recruitment made a greater contribution to population maintenance when an acute disturbance was followed by calm conditions, but sexual recruitment made a far greater contribution in the absence of disturbance, or when populations were exposed to severe-chronic or frequent-acute disturbances. The success of asexual recruitment by corals in response to disturbances is discussed in the light of their exposure to a greater variety and combination of disturbances arising from anthropogenic influences...|$|E
