Ad 12 DNA replication and late-gene and virus-associated RNA expression are blocked in hamster cells. Early Ad 12 genes are transcribed, and the viral DNA {{can be integrated}} into the host genome. Ad 12 DNA replication and late-gene transcription can be complemented in hamster cells by E 1 functions of Ad 2 or Ad 5, for which hamster cells are fully permissive (for a review, see W. Doerfler, Adv. Virus Res. 39 : 89 - 128, 1991). We have previously demonstrated that a 33 -nucleotide <b>mitigator</b> sequence, which is located in the downstream region of the major late promoter (MLP) of Ad 12 DNA, is responsible for the inactivity of the Ad 12 MLP in hamster cells (C. Zock and W. Doerfler, EMBO J. 9 : 1615 - 1623, 1990). A similar negative regulator has not been found in the MLP of Ad 2 DNA. We have now studied the mechanism of action of this <b>mitigator</b> element. The results of nuclear run-on experiments document the absence of MLP transcripts in the nuclei of Ad 12 -infected BHK 21 hamster cells. Surprisingly, the <b>mitigator</b> element cannot elicit its function in in vitro transcription experiments with nuclear extracts from both hamster BHK 21 and human HeLa cells. Intact nuclear topology and/or tightly bound nuclear elements that cannot be eluted in nuclear extracts are somehow required for recognition of the Ad 12 <b>mitigator.</b> Electrophoretic mobility shift assays have not revealed significant differences in the binding of proteins from human HeLa or hamster BHK 21 cells to the <b>mitigator</b> sequence in the MLP of Ad 12 DNA or to the corresponding sequence in Ad 2 DNA. We have converted the sequence of the <b>mitigator</b> in the MLP of Ad 12 DNA to the equivalent sequence in the MLP of Ad 2 DNA by site-directed mutagenesis. This construct was not active in hamster cells. When the Ad 12 <b>mitigator,</b> on the other hand, was inserted into the Ad 2 MLP, the latter's function in hamster cells was not compromised. Deletions in the 5 ' upstream region of the Ad 12 MLP have provided evidence for the existence of additional sequences that codetermine the deficiency of the Ad 12 MLP in hamster cells.

40|$|Death {{qualification}} {{is a part}} of {{voir dire}} that is unique to capital trials. Unlike all other litigation, capital jurors must affirm their willingness to impose both legal standards (either life in prison or the death penalty). Jurors who assert they are able to do so are deemed “death-qualified” and are eligible for capital jury service: jurors who assert that they are unable to do so are deemed “excludable” or “scrupled” and are barred from hearing a death penalty case. During the penalty phase in capital trials, death-qualified jurors weigh the aggravators (i. e., arguments for death) against the <b>mitigators</b> (i. e., arguments for life) {{in order to determine the}} sentence. If the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances, then the jury is to recommend death; if the mitigating circumstances outweigh the aggravating circumstances, then the jury is to recommend life. The jury is free to weigh each aggravating and mitigating circumstance in any matter they see fit. Previous research has found that death qualification impacts jurors 2 ̆ 7 receptiveness to aggravating and mitigating circumstances (e. g., Luginbuhl 2 ̆ 6 Middendorf, 1988). However, these studies utilized the now-defunct Witherspoon rule and did not include a case scenario for participants to reference. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether death qualification affects jurors 2 ̆ 7 endorsements of aggravating and mitigating circumstances when Witt, rather than Witherspoon, is the legal standard for death qualification. Four hundred and fifty venirepersons from the 11 th Judicial Circuit in Miami, Florida completed a booklet of stimulus materials that contained the following: two death qualification questions; a case scenario that included a summary of the guilt and penalty phases of a capital case; a 26 -item measure that required participants to endorse aggravators, nonstatutory <b>mitigators,</b> and statutory <b>mitigators</b> on a 6 -point Likert scale; and standard demographic questions. Results indicated that death-qualified venirepersons, when compared to excludables, were more likely to endorse aggravating circumstances. Excludable participants, when compared to death-qualified venirepersons, were more likely to endorse nonstatutory <b>mitigators.</b> There was no significant difference between death-qualified and excludable venirepersons with respect to their endorsement of 6 out of 7 statutory <b>mitigators.</b> It would appear that the Furman v. Georgia (1972) decision to declare the death penalty unconstitutional is frustrated by the Lockhart v. McCree (1986) affirmation of death qualification. ...|$|R

With the use of radiosensitizers and radioprotective agents, the course of radiotherapy has improved the sensitization of tumor cells and protection of normal cells, respectively. The aim of this paper was to critically review and analyze the available compounds used as radiosensitizers, radioprotectors, and radiation <b>mitigators.</b> For reviewing, the author used the electronic search for the keywords ′Radiosensitizers′, ′Radioprotectors′, ′Radiation mitigators′ on PubMed for inclusion of previously published articles and further search of reference papers on individual radiosensitizing and radioprotecting agents was done. Radiosensitizers are agents that sensitize the tumor cells to radiation. These compounds apparently promote fixation of the free radicals produced by radiation damage at the molecular level. The mechanism of action is similar to the oxygen effect, in which biochemical reactions in the damaged molecules prevent repair of the cellular radiation damage. Free radicals such as OH + are captured by the electron affinity of the radiosensitizers, rendering the molecules incapable of repair. Radioprotectors are compounds that are designed to reduce the damage in normal tissues caused by radiation. These compounds are often antioxidants and must be present before or at the time of radiation for effectiveness.

Results: Irradiated mice showed reduced peripheral blood lymphocytes and neutrophils and bone marrow cellularity at day 5.

40|$|Abstract—Influence {{blocking}} {{games have}} been used to model adversarial domains with a social component, such as counterinsurgency. In these games, a <b>mitigator</b> attempts to minimize the efforts of an influencer to spread his agenda across a social network. Previous work has assumed that the influence graph structure is known with certainty by both players. However, in reality, there is often significant information asymmetry between the <b>mitigator</b> and the influencer. We introduce a model of this information asymmetry as a two-player zero-sum Bayesian game. Nearly all past work in influence maximization and social network analysis suggests that graph structure is fundamental in strategy generation, leading to an expectation that solving the Bayesian game exactly is crucial. Surprisingly, we show through extensive experimentation on synthetic and real-world social networks that many common forms of uncertainty can be addressed nearoptimally by ignoring the vast majority of it and simply solving an abstracted game with a few randomly chosen types. This suggests that optimal strategies of games that do not model the full range of uncertainty in influence blocking games are typically robust to uncertainty about the influence graph structure.
