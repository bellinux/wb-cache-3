5|$|By {{utilizing}} a short route and using mounted riders rather than traditional stagecoaches, they proposed {{to establish a}} fast mail service between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California, with letters delivered in 10 days, a duration many said was impossible. The initial price was set at $5 per , then $2.50, and by July 1861 to $1.

5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II, the Ma and Pa {{acquired}} four {{diesel locomotives}} for more economical operations, but traffic declined significantly. When the Ma and Pa's <b>mail</b> <b>contract</b> was cancelled by the U.S. postal service, the railroad discontinued all passenger service on August 31, 1954. One person on the last passenger train recalled that many riders came {{from as far away}} as Boston, Massachusetts, and Washington, D.C., to participate in the historic event, along with members of the National Railway Historical Society. The picturesque line's last steam engine dropped its fire for the final time on November 29, 1956.|$|E
5|$|In 1839 Samuel Cunard, a Prince Edward Island shipowner, {{was awarded}} the first British transatlantic {{steamship}} <b>mail</b> <b>contract,</b> {{and the next year}} formed the British and North American Royal Mail Steam-Packet Company together with Robert Napier, the famous Scottish steamship engine designer and builder, to operate the line's four pioneer paddle steamers on the Liverpool–Halifax–Boston route. For most of the next 30 years, Cunard held the Blue Riband for the fastest Atlantic voyage. However, in the 1870s Cunard fell behind its rivals, the White Star Line and the Inman Line. To meet this competition, in 1879 the firm was reorganised as the Cunard Steamship Company, Ltd, to raise capital.|$|E
50|$|In 1934, {{following}} a Congressional investigation of how air <b>mail</b> <b>contracts</b> had been awarded by the United States Postal Service, President Franklin D. Roosevelt cancelled all existing air <b>mail</b> <b>contracts</b> and assigned {{the duty of}} flying the mail to the Air Corps. The squadron began flying its P-12s on air mail routes, but they proved unsuitable for the work, lacking instruments to fly at night or in adverse weather. Moreover, they could only carry about 50 lbs of mail, and with the mail load, the planes were tail heavy and difficult to fly. The P-12s were withdrawn from the project within a week, although the larger observation aircraft continued to fly mail until May, when new air <b>mail</b> <b>contracts</b> were awarded.|$|R

5|$|Around {{the turn}} of the millennium, the airline renewed its aging fleet, {{retiring}} several of its S-61 and 206 helicopters and replacing them with Bell 212s and Eurocopter AS350s. The company also sacked its CEO Peter Fich, who had proven unable to balance Greenland Home Rule's demands for local Greenlander service with the board's for expanded tourism, lower fares and higher profits. Under his replacement Finn Øelund, Grønlandsfly initially posted a DKK 30 million loss as contractual obligations maintained unprofitable service while a strike ruined the summer tourist season and Post Greenland moved a lucrative <b>mail</b> <b>contract</b> to the Danish-owned Air Alpha Greenland. In response, the company successfully pushed back against Greenland Home Rule's large demands, high fees and low subsidies and rebranded itself, anglicising its name to Air Greenland and adopting a new logo and livery on 18 April 2002.|$|E

25|$|Exactly when mail {{began to}} be carried by the railway is not known, but {{it is known that}} in 1873 the {{postmaster}} terminated a <b>mail</b> <b>contract</b> with the railway because he found the service to be more unreliable than the road service.|$|E

25|$|One {{consequence}} of the Utah War {{was the creation of}} the famous Pony Express. During the war, Lot Smith and the Nauvoo Legion burned roughly 52 wagons belonging to outfitters Russell, Majors and Waddell.

25|$|Pacific Mail's woes were {{exacerbated}} {{after the}} stock speculator Jay Gould, in a clandestine attempt {{to acquire the}} company's stock cheaply, persuaded the U.S. Congress to rescind its $500,000 annual subsidy. Pacific Mail's inability to meet its financial obligations threatened in turn {{the survival of the}} shipbuilder John Roach and Sons, which had already invested {{more than a million dollars}} in constructing the two ships, but Roach was able to hold off his own creditors. Roach eventually renegotiated the Pacific <b>Mail</b> <b>contract,</b> reducing the latter's monthly obligations from $75,000 to $35,000, and the two vessels were launched in 1874.|$|E

25|$|United Aircraft and Transport Corporation (UA) was {{a holding}} company created in 1928 that {{included}} Boeing Aircraft and United Air Lines, itself a holding {{company for a}} collection of small airlines that continued to operate under their own names.

25|$|The {{first two}} of these ships, the passenger-cargo vessels Colon (2,686 tons) and Colima (2,906 tons), were {{delivered}} in November 1872 and April 1873 respectively, but {{in the spring of}} 1873, Pacific Mail informed Roach that it was unable to meet its obligations. Pacific Mail's President and another company director had depleted the company's cash reserves with a stock manipulation scheme, and then absconded with a large sum of money after the scheme fell through. To make matters worse, stock speculator Jay Gould, in an attempt to gain control of the company by driving down its share price, subsequently persuaded the U.S. Congress to rescind Pacific Mail's $500,000 subsidy. Roach was put in a difficult position since he had several Pacific Mail steamships still on the slipways, but he managed to delay his own creditors and renegotiate the Pacific <b>Mail</b> <b>contract,</b> reducing the latter's monthly obligations from $75,000 to $35,000.|$|E
25|$|In 1846 began {{inquiries}} {{regarding the}} building of steamships for regularly scheduled transatlantic service. Edward Mills, a novice in the shipping business, led a syndicate that received the contract for mail delivery to Le Havre and Bremen for five years. With his associates C. H. Sand, Mortimer Livingston and John L. Stephens, he founded the Ocean Steam Navigation Company in May 1846. The company was unable to attract sufficient capital {{to carry out its}} original business plan to build four ships and instead ordered two ships from Westervelt & MacKay, Washington and Hermann (1848). The Westervelt shipyard built the hull, and the engines were made by Stillman, Allen & Co. This was one of the less successful chapters {{in the history of the}} Westervelt shipyard. Both paddle steamers were said to be slow and had insufficient cargo space, and the government soon revoked the Le Havre portion of the <b>mail</b> <b>contract</b> because of the line’s poor performance.|$|E

5000|$|It {{was used}} by many {{shipping}} lines, but is often associated in particular with the White Star Line, Cunard Line, Royal Mail Lines and Union-Castle Line, which held a number of high-profile <b>mail</b> <b>contracts,</b> and traditionally prefixed the names of many of their ships with the initials [...] "RMS".|$|R
50|$|The Britannia-class was the Cunard Lines initial {{fleet of}} wooden paddlers that {{established}} {{the first year}} round scheduled Atlantic steamship service in 1840. By 1845, steamships carried half of the transatlantic saloon passengers and Cunard dominated this trade. While the units of the Britannia class were solid performers, they were not superior {{to many of the}} other steamers being placed on the Atlantic at that time. What made the Britannia’s successful is that they were the first homogeneous class of transatlantic steamships to provide a frequent and uniform service. Britannia, Acadia and Caledonia were commissioned in 1840 and Columbia in 1841 enabling Cunard to provide the dependable schedule of sailings required under his <b>mail</b> <b>contracts</b> with the Admiralty. It was these <b>mail</b> <b>contracts</b> that enabled Cunard to survive when all of his early competitors failed.|$|R
25|$|In 1866, the U.S. {{government}} {{awarded the}} first <b>mail</b> <b>contract</b> of $500,000 per annum between San Francisco and the Far East — namely Hong Kong via Japan and the Sandwich Islands (later {{known as the}} Hawaiian Islands) — to Pacific Mail. The SS Colorado was pulled from the original New York–San Francisco route to be used on the new route from San Francisco to China and Japan. The Colorado was outfitted with a mizzen mast and more coal storage for the voyage, and in 1867, became the first steamship to run a regular service across the Pacific Ocean, running from San Francisco to Yokohama, Japan and onward to Hong Kong. Pacific Mail also ordered four new ships to run on this route: the SS China, SS Japan, SS Great Republic and SS America. These ships were ordered {{at a cost of}} $1 million, and the capital of the company was increased to $20 million to cover this cost.|$|E
25|$|In 1846 the Oregon {{boundary}} dispute was settled with Great Britain and California was under U.S. control in 1847 and annexed {{and paid for}} in 1848. The United States was now a Pacific Ocean power. Starting in 1848 the U.S. Congress, after the annexation of California but before the California Gold Rush was confirmed there, had subsidized the Pacific Mail Steamship Company with $199,999 to set up regular packet ship, mail, passenger and cargo routes in the Pacific Ocean. This {{was to be a}} regular scheduled route from Panama City, Nicaragua and Mexico to and from San Francisco and Oregon. Panama City was the Pacific terminus of the Isthmus of Panama trail across Panama. The Atlantic Ocean <b>mail</b> <b>contract</b> from East Coast cities and New Orleans to and {{from the mouth of the}} Chagres River in Isthmus of Panama was won by the United States Mail Steamship Company whose first paddle wheel steamship, the SS Falcon (1848) was dispatched on 1 December 1848 to the Caribbean (Atlantic) terminus of the Isthmus of Panama trail—the Chagres River.|$|E
500|$|The loss in 1967 of {{mail and}} express contracts, which by then {{accounted}} for almost 70 percent of passenger train {{revenue for the}} B, [...] severely affected the B's passenger service.

500|$|The first {{shipping}} line to begin regular transatlantic steamer services was the British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, {{better known as}} the Cunard Line in recognition of its founder, the Canadian Samuel Cunard. It began its operations on July 4, 1840, when [...] left Liverpool for Boston, via Halifax, Nova Scotia. As the principal transatlantic mail carrier, the Cunard Line received subsidies from the British government and from the United States Post Office Department, the latter a point that rankled with some Americans, who felt that a home-owned line should be the beneficiary. [...] Senator James A. Bayard of Delaware was among those urging Congress to subsidize a US steamship line: [...] "America will soon become tired of being informed of British maritime supremacy... I suggest that Congress grant a carefully selected American shipping expert a completely free hand to proceed with the absolute conquest of this man Cunard". In 1845 the postmaster general invited tenders for a transatlantic <b>mail</b> <b>contract.</b> The successful bidder, announced on March 3, 1847, was New York shipowner Edward Knight Collins.|$|E
500|$|Hudson Heaven died in 1916, and was {{succeeded by}} his nephew, Walter Charles Hudson Heaven. [...] With the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, matters deteriorated seriously, and in 1918 the family sold Lundy to Augustus Langham Christie. In 1924, the Christie family sold the island along with the <b>mail</b> <b>contract</b> and the MV Lerina to Martin Coles Harman, who proclaimed himself a king. Harman issued two coins of Half Puffin and One Puffin denominations in 1929, nominally equivalent to the British halfpenny and penny, resulting in his prosecution under the United Kingdom's Coinage Act of 1870. The House of Lords found him guilty in 1931, and he was fined £5 with fifteen guineas (£5 + £15.75) expenses. The coins were withdrawn and became collectors' items. In 1965 a [...] "fantasy" [...] restrike four-coin set, a few in gold, was issued to commemorate 40 years since Harman purchased the island. Harman's son, John Pennington Harman was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross during the Battle of Kohima, India in 1944. There is a memorial to him at the VC Quarry on Lundy. Martin Coles Harman died in 1954.|$|E
500|$|Owing to {{a decline}} in {{population}} and lack of interest in the <b>mail</b> <b>contract,</b> the GPO ended its presence on Lundy at the end of 1927. For the next two years Harman handled the mail to and from the island without charge. On 1 November 1929, he decided to offset the expense by issuing two postage stamps (½ puffin in pink and 1 puffin in blue). One puffin is equivalent to one English penny. The printing of Puffin stamps continues to this day and they are available at face value from the Lundy Post Office. One used to have to stick Lundy stamps {{on the back of the}} envelope; but Royal Mail now allows their use on the front of the envelope, but placed on the left side, with the right side reserved for the Royal Mail postage stamp or stamps. Lundy stamps are cancelled by a circular Lundy handstamp. The face value of the Lundy Island stamps covers the cost of postage of letters and postcards from the island to the Bideford Post Office on the mainland for onward delivery to their final destination anywhere in the world. The Lundy Post Office gets a bulk rate discount for mailing letters and postcards from Bideford. Lundy stamps are a type of postage stamp known to philatelists as [...] "local carriage labels" [...] or [...] "local stamps". Issues of increasing value were made over the years, including air mail, featuring a variety of people. Many are now highly sought-after by collectors. The market value of the early issues has risen substantially over the years. For the many thousands of annual visitors Lundy stamps have become part of the collection of the many British Local Posts collectors. The first catalogues of these stamps included Gerald Rosen's 1970 Catalogue of British Local Stamps. Later specialist catalogues include Stamps of Lundy Island by Stanley Newman, first published in 1984, Phillips Modern British Locals CD Catalogue, published since 2003, and Labbe's Specialised Guide to Lundy Island Stamps, published since 2005 and now in its 11th Edition. Labbe's Guide is considered the gold standard of Lundy catalogues owing to its extensive approach to varieties, errors, specialised items and [...] "fantasy" [...] issues. There is a comprehensive collection of these stamps in the Chinchen Collection, donated by Barry Chinchen to the British Library Philatelic Collections in 1977 and now held by the British Library. This is also the home of the Landmark Trust Lundy Island Philatelic Archive which includes artwork, texts and essays as well as postmarking devices and issued stamps.|$|E
