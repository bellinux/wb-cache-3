5000|$|Many {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of a <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumor</b> do not distinguish between these two principal classes of <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumor.</b> However, on a radiograph usually the former class will have an irregular shape and the latter class will have a smooth spherical or ovoid shape. A large minority of patients with a mediastinal teratoma (including dermoid cyst) will cough up hair. [...] For a differential diagnosis, the key is to exclude aneurism.|$|E
5000|$|Causes of {{pulmonary}} hypoplasia {{include a}} wide variety of congenital malformations and other conditions in which pulmonary hypoplasia is a complication. [...] These include congenital diaphragmatic hernia, congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, fetal hydronephrosis, caudal regression syndrome, <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumor,</b> and sacrococcygeal teratoma with a large component inside the fetus. [...] Large masses of the neck (such as cervical teratoma) also can cause pulmonary hypoplasia, presumably by interfering with the fetus's ability to fill its lungs. In the presence of pulmonary hypoplasia, the EXIT procedure to rescue a baby with a neck mass is not likely to succeed.|$|E
5000|$|Most common primary {{anterior}} <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumor</b> (20%) {{in adults}} but rarely seen in children. It {{can be classified}} as lymphocytic, epithelial, or spindle cell histologies, but the clinical significance of these classifications is controversial. [...] Tonofibrils seen under electron microscopy can differentiate thymoma from other tumors such as carcinoid, Hodgkin's, and seminoma. Patients are usually asymptomatic but can present with myasthenia gravis-related symptoms, substernal pain, dyspnea, or cough. Invasive tumors can produce compression effects such as superior vena cava syndrome. (3,4) Thymomas are diagnosed with CT or MRI revealing a mass in anterior mediastinum. Therapy in stage I tumors consists of surgical resection with good prognosis. Stage II-III requires maximal resection possible followed by radiation. Stage IV disease requires addition of cisplatin-based chemotherapy {{in addition to those}} in stage II and III. For those with invasive thymoma, treatment is based on induction chemotherapy, surgical resection, and post-surgical radiation. 5-year survival for invasive thymoma is between 12-54% regardless of any myasthenia gravis symptoms (5,6).|$|E
40|$|Background: Many {{successful}} {{attempts at}} removing benign <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumors</b> with the video-assisted thoracoscopic technique have been reported, but no formal report {{has been published}} regarding malignant <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumors</b> treated with this technique. We report our preliminary experience with video-assisted thoracoscopic removal of <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumors,</b> benign or malignant. Methods: Seven patients with <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumors</b> treated with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery were reviewed from January 1999 to April 2000. Their tumor pathologies included benign or malignant thymoma, neurilemmoma, and teratoma. Results: The mean operation time was 240 minutes. The mean blood loss was 173 mL. The mean insertion time of chest tubes was 3 days. The mean admission time was 6 days. No deaths occurred during the study. Morbidity occurred in 2 patients. No tumor recurrence has been seen during the mean follow-up of 7 months. Conclusions: The short-term results support the feasibility of VATS in managing technically resectable <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumors.</b> Yet the long-term prognosis for the malignant lesions is deferred and needs further study.

40|$|The {{posterior}} mediastinum, a term {{synonymous with}} the paravertebral sulci, is the potential space situated along each side of thevertebral column and adjacent proximal portions of the ribs. The most commonly encountered posterior <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumors</b> are the neurogenic tumors accounting for 75 % of them. The posterior <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumors</b> may extend into the spinal canal via the intervertebral foramen(dumbbell tumors). These ones account for 10 % of the posterior <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumors</b> and 10 % of them are malignant. Due to their presence in two distinct anatomic regions, the thorax and spinalcanal, the surgical treatement of dumbbell tumors require a multidisciplinary approach: thoracic surgeon and neurosurgeon. We present {{the experience of the}} Thoracic Surgery Clinic in thesurgery of posterior <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumors</b> with extension into the spinal canal throughout a 9 year period (2001 – 2010). Seven cases admitted and operated in this period are being analysed.

40|$|Background: <b>Mediastinal</b> <b>tumors</b> {{often require}} {{surgical}} biopsy {{to achieve a}} precise and rapid diagnosis. However, subjects with <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumors</b> may be unfit for general anesthesia, particularly when compression of major vessels or airways does occur. We tested the applicability in this setting of a minimalist (M) uniportal, video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) strategy carried out under locoregional anesthesia in awake patients (MVATS). Methods: We analyzed in a comparative fashion including propensity score matching, data from a prospectively collected database of patients who were offered surgical biopsy for <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumors</b> through either MVATS or standard VATS. Tested outcome measures included feasibility, diagnostic yield, and morbidity. Results: A total of 24 procedures were performed through MVATS. Diagnostic yield was 100...|$|R

40|$|Objective(s) : This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the role of pretreatment SUVmax and volumetric FDG positron emission tomography (PET) parameters in the differentiation between benign and malignant <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumors.</b> In addition, we investigated whether pretreatment SUVmax and volumetric FDG-PET parameters could distinguish thymomas from thymic carcinomas, and low-risk from high-risk thymomas. Methods: This study was conducted on 52 patients with <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumors</b> undergoing FDG-PET/CT. Histological examination indicated that 29 <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumors</b> were benign, and 23 cases were malignant. To obtain quantitative PET/CT parameters, we determined the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), volumetric parameters, metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) for primary tumors using SUVmax cut-off value of 2. 5. SUVmax, MTV and TLG of benign and malignant tumors were comparedusing the Mann-Whitney U test. Moreover, receiver-operating curve (ROC) analysis was applied to identify the cut-off values of SUVmax, MTV and TLG for the accurate differentiation of benign and malignant tumors. SUVmax, MTV and TLG were compared between thymomas and thymic carcinomas, as well as low-risk and high-risk thymomas.

30|$|Because primary mediastinal liposarcomas grow {{slowly and}} are {{relatively}} unlikely to invade surrounding organs, many patients remain asymptomatic until their tumors are very large. Therefore, mediastinal liposarcomas can be huge when detected. Various surgical approaches should be considered. Median sternotomy {{is a common}} approach to resecting <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumors.</b> However, it may not afford adequate exposure of <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumors</b> that extend into the thoracic cavity. Clamshell incisions are used to resect bilateral pulmonary metastases and large <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumors,</b> {{as well as for}} bilateral lung transplantation. Because a component of clamshell incisions is a large transverse incision, they provide good access to the intrapleural space bilaterally. In contrast, the median vertical incision for sternotomy provides better exposure of superior and anterior mediastinal lesions. In this case, we selected a clamshell incision because we expected it to provide good visualization of the bilateral extensions of the tumor into the thoracic cavity.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} preoperative characteristics {{associated with}} complete surgical resection of primary malignant <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumors.</b> METHODS: Between 1996 and 2006, 42 patients with primary malignant <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumors</b> were submitted to surgery with curative intent {{at a single}} facility. Patient charts were reviewed in order to collect data related to demographics, clinical manifestation, characteristics of <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumors</b> and imaging aspects of invasiveness. RESULTS: The surgical resection was considered complete in 69. 1 % of the patients. Cases of incomplete resection were attributed to invasion of the following structures: large blood vessels (4 cases); the superior vena cava (3 cases); the heart (2 cases); the lung and chest wall (3 cases); and the trachea (1 case). Overall survival was significantly better among the patients submitted to complete surgical resection than among those submitted to incomplete resection. The frequency of incomplete resection was significantly higher in {{cases in which the}} tumor had invaded organs other than the lung (as identified through imaging studies) than in those in which it was restricted to the lung (47. 6 % vs. 14. 3 %; p = 0. 04). None of the other preoperative characteristics analyzed were found to be associated with complete resection.

30|$|Presuming {{that the}} {{respiratory}} and cardiovascular effects of his <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumor</b> were not {{critical in the}} preoperative state, the reason why he developed SVC syndrome was unclear. It was an incident that would ultimately occur. Obviously, {{the primary cause of}} the rapid development of SVC syndrome was fluid infusion from an upper extremity. The fluid infusion from the upper extremity easily exceeded the drainage capacity of the collateral pathways, which increased venous pressure and promoted upper body edema. Simultaneously, the reduction of preload by mannitol-induced urination and afterload by anesthesia was not corrected by regular fluid infusion protocol using upper extremity fluid lines, which required further fluid infusion and administration of noradrenalin. This vicious circle exacerbated tracheal compression by the <b>mediastinal</b> <b>tumor</b> and brain edema. Therefore, intravenous lines in the upper extremities are contraindicated in cases with presence of SVC obstruction [1, 2] and such a patient can actually develop SVC syndrome with upper extremity fluid lines. We were overly optimistic about this case.|$|E
