Kenseth began stock car racing in 1988 at the age of 16 at Madison International Speedway. [...] "My dad bought a car when I was 13 and raced it at Madison," [...] Kenseth said. [...] "Neither of us knew much and it was a learning experience. He continued to race in 1988 and 1989. My first car– what might be considered a sportsman– was a 1981 Camaro that Todd Kropf had driven to championships at Madison and Columbus 151 Speedway. On the third night out I won a feature. I ran 15 features in 1983 and won two of them." [...] "The first night out in the Kropf car Matt won a heat race," [...] said Kenseth's father Roy. [...] "The third night he won the feature by holding off two of the best drivers at the track, Pete Moore and Dave Phillips, for 20 laps. Matt was smooth. I knew then {{he was going to be}} a racer." [...] He ran for the points title on Saturday nights at Wisconsin Dells in 1989. He finished second in points and won eight features. On Friday nights, he ran about half of the races at Golden Sands Speedway and half at Columbus 151 Speedway. In 1990, he bought a late model from Rich Bickle. In the season-opening race at Slinger Super Speedway, Kenseth inherited the lead and won his only race of the season when track champion Tony Strupp had a flat tire. He finished sixth in season points and won the track's rookie of the year award. Kenseth entered fifteen ARTGO events that season and raced in 40 features that year. After graduating from [...] Cambridge High School that summer, Kenseth worked for four years selling and shipping parts for Left-hander Chassis, a late model racecar chassis manufacturer just south of Wisconsin in Illinois. In 1991 he won the ARTGO race at La Crosse Fairgrounds Speedway to become the youngest winner in the series' history. He passed Joe Shear and Steve Holzhausen, and held off Steve and Tom Carlson for the win. 1992 was a difficult year for Kenseth. He won three races and blew up more engines than he could count. He was ready to quit racing after the season. [...] "I felt we were at a standstill", he said. [...] "I wasn't gaining. <b>My</b> <b>dad</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had some major discussions at the end of the year. We had to find the dollars for a good program or I told him I would rather not race." [...] Kipley Performance loaned a motor to Kenseth for the season-final race at La Crosse and the team ran better. Kenseth built a new car for 1993 using a Kipley engine. He used the car at Madison to win eight features and finished second in the points. Mike Butz offered Kenseth the chance to race his late model, and it took some time for the combination to stop struggling before they started winning features. At the end of the season, they won the final short track series race at Madison, La Crosse, and I-70 Speedway.|$|E

To Jyoti I say a big thank you for answering most of my many questions especially on computational issues and for the time we spent together talking about non-academic things. It was a pleasure sharing the same office with Derek during my stay here and meeting Susana on my return from Houston. I am also very grateful to my former roommates and friends, Tunde, Rotimi and Michael for the times we shared together. To my mother I say a big thank you for all her prayers and encouragement. To my siblings I also say thank you. In conclusion, I would like to acknowledge the Oyelola’s and Sheun for making me feel at home here in Austin. THE TRANSPORT OF SUSPENSIONS IN GEOLOGICAL...|$|R
40|$|To <b>my</b> mom <b>and</b> <b>dad.</b> Acknowledgments <b>I</b> {{am deeply}} in debt to my advisors, Dr. Arun Lakhotia and Dr. Anthony Maida for their {{valuable}} support, patience and guidance throughout my research and dissertation work. Dr. Arun Lakhotia {{has always been}} there supporting me and motivating me in my research and pushing me to new limits. I also want {{to thank him for}} leading the Team CajunBot and providing all the support <b>and</b> resources that <b>I</b> ever required. This support has given me strength to concentrate on my actual research work. I thank Dr. Anthony Maida for being one of the greatest mentors in my life. He has been guiding me with my work since my initial days in this country. His patient listening and calm support has always given me the strength to challenge new research problems. I thank him for all his guidance. I thank Pablo Mejia for his continuous support and for the countless hours he spent discussing different algorithms with me. He has always inspired me with his intelligence and hard work, and most importantly his down to earth attitude despite all his skills. I always try to follow his example and hope to be like him. I consider myself honored to be able to wor...|$|R
40|$|If {{educational}} success {{begins at}} home, then my parents deserve as much {{credit for this}} accomplishment as I do. Two of my favorite childhood photos show my parents reading to me: one of my mother Lynn Stertz reading {{to me in a}} hotel room on a family trip, and the other of <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> Tom Stertz <b>and</b> <b>I</b> reading on the couch at home, his eyes wide with the drama of his storytelling and my face lit up in laughter. For their investment in my early education I am deeply grateful. Both of my parents had high expectations for my academic achievement and never failed to express pride in my meeting (or exceeding) those expectations or to provide assistance if I floundered (which, let’s face it, didn’t happen often). As a Vice President at Thrivent and a Fellow in the Society of Actuaries, my mother also showed me how to be an accomplished, professional woman without putting on airs. <b>My</b> <b>dad</b> has provided a tremendous example of the lifelong pursuit of knowledge and passion for learning in his own career as an educator. It {{should come as no surprise}} that several excellent teachers helped pave the way for this degree. I thank Ms. Marlene Glaus for her energetic commitment to expanding what we third graders at Centennial Elementary in Richfield knew about art, architecture, and travel in 1983. Ms. Glaus provided me with my first publication at nine years old b...|$|R
