It is designed with the incorporation of Howard Gardner’s “Five Minds for the Future” (Disciplined <b>Mind,</b> Synthesizing <b>Mind,</b> Ethical <b>Mind,</b> Creating <b>Mind,</b> Respectful <b>Mind),</b> with an additional sixth <b>mind,</b> the ‘Bi-cultural Mind’.|$|E

5|$|The <b>mind</b> of William Bell (Leonard Nimoy) still {{possesses}} Olivia's (Anna Torv) body {{after several}} failed attempts to extract it to recently deceased corpses. Walter (John Noble) and William {{believe that they}} have less than a day before Olivia's <b>mind</b> will be lost. They realize that Olivia is unaware that she has been possessed by William's <b>mind,</b> and instead has likely locked her ego away, making it difficult to contact her by normal means. Walter comes up with a plan: he and Peter (Joshua Jackson) will enter Olivia's <b>mind</b> with the aid of LSD to locate her ego and help it to regain dominance in her <b>mind,</b> while Walter hopes to download William's <b>mind</b> into a computer.|$|E

This sister-series of videos continued after the release of Odyssey Into The <b>Mind's</b> Eye with the final three titles: The <b>Mind's</b> Eye Presents Luminous Visions (Odyssey Productions, 1998) and The <b>Mind's</b> Eye Presents Ancient Alien (Odyssey Productions, 1998), and The <b>Mind's</b> Eye Presents Little Bytes (Odyssey Productions, 2000).|$|R

5|$|Where is the <b>mind</b> located? If the <b>mind</b> is a {{physical}} phenomenon of some kind, {{it has to be}} located somewhere. According to some, there are two possible options: either the <b>mind</b> is internal to the body (internalism) or the <b>mind</b> is external to it (externalism). More generally, either the <b>mind</b> depends only on events and properties taking place inside the subject's body or it depends also on factors external to it.|$|E

40|$|The {{epistemological}} {{problem of}} other <b>minds</b> "� the hallowed philosophical quandary of justifying {{belief in the}} existence of other <b>minds</b> like one's own "� is a problem about how humans come to know <b>minds.</b> Historically, most philosophers have broached the problem of other <b>minds</b> entirely from their armchairs, without incorporating knowledge from relevant scientific theories. This thesis lays out what the science shows about how humans understand their own <b>minds</b> and other <b>minds,</b> and discusses what the evidence does to vindicate or deny leading philosophical accounts of attributions of mindedness. This evidence, drawn from work in psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and philosophy, strongly suggests that the problem of other <b>minds</b> is misguided and confused from the get-go and that there is no greater problem with belief in other <b>minds</b> than belief in one's own...|$|R

5|$|Additionally, the {{development}} of Theory of <b>Mind</b> {{may play a role}} in emotional development. Theory of <b>Mind</b> is the ability to know that the experience of knowledge and intention lies behind human actions such as facial expressions. Although it is reported that very young infants have different responses to humans than to non-human objects, Theory of <b>Mind</b> develops relatively gradually and possibly results from predictable interactions with adults. However, some ability of this kind must be in place before mutual communication through gaze or other gesture can occur, as it does by seven to nine months. Some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, have been attributed to the absence of the mental functions that underlie Theory of <b>Mind.</b> It is possible that the congenital absence of this ability, or the lack of experiences with caregivers who communicate in a predictable fashion, could underlie {{the development}} of reactive attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|An away team boards the cube, {{discovering}} that either {{an accident or}} another species disabled the vessel. They take a Borg drone back onto Voyager, where the Doctor (Robert Picardo) accidentally revives it. After being told by Frazier to remain where he is, Chakotay breaks {{out of his room}} where he sees that all the people around him on the alien planet possess Borg implant technology in their bodies. Frazier explains that an electro-kinetic storm broke their link with the Borg hive <b>mind.</b> Instead, the separated drones settled on a nearby planet. Chakotay's health gets worse, and the ex-Borg offer to connect him to a joint <b>mind</b> to heal his injuries, and he reluctantly accepts. Once part of the hive <b>mind,</b> he sees a montage of their memories. After Voyager arrives, Frazier and her group want Janeway to re-activate the neuroelectric generator on the damaged cube to extend a new joint <b>mind</b> across the entire planet.|$|E
5|$|An {{exception}} {{to all of}} this would be the Primal Zerg, who inhabit the original Zerg homeworld of Zerus (as seen in Heart of the Swarm). The Zerg Hive <b>Mind</b> was created to control the Zerg, and eventually put them {{under the control of the}} main antagonist of the series, the fallen Xel'Naga Amon. Some Zerg, however, managed to avoid being subsumed. These are the Primal Zerg, who have much the same genetic abilities but are not bound to the Overmind. These creatures are each independently sapient, and if they follow a leader it is because they choose to. Their lack of a Hive <b>Mind</b> also shields them from specific psionic attacks engineered to counter the Zerg Hive <b>Mind.</b>|$|E

40|$|How simple <b>minded</b> can you be? Many {{philosophers}} would answer: no more simple than a language-using human being.

40|$|Evidence that <b>minds</b> are neural {{electromagnetic}} (EM) fields {{comes from}} research into how separate brain activities bind to form unified percepts and unified <b>minds.</b> Explanations of binding using synchrony, attention and convergence are all problematic. But {{the unity of}} EM fields explains binding without these problems. These unified fields neatly explain correlations and divergences between synchrony, attention, convergence, and unified <b>minds.</b> The simplest explanation for the unity of both <b>minds</b> and fields is that <b>minds</b> are fields. Treating <b>minds</b> as the fields’ underlying, intrinsic nature has the further virtue of avoiding mind-body problems. There’s also rising evidence that EM fields interact with brains. McFadden argues here that fields help shift {{the focus of attention}} by initiating synchrony in different neural networks, which boosts their own fields and thereby binds their activity. This evidence that <b>minds</b> are fields that bind and guide brain activities supports free will over epiphenomenalism and supervenience...|$|R
