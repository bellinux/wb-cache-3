5|$|The {{huge number}} of clipped coins in the Hoxne Hoard has <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> archaeologists to observe the process of coin-clipping in detail. The coins were evidently cut face-up to avoid {{damaging}} the portrait. The average level of clipping is roughly the same for coins dating from 350 onwards.|$|E
50|$|In September 1882, a fire {{destroyed}} {{the library and}} a part of the scientific material of the society. The efforts of William Macleay <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> nevertheless <b>for</b> the society to continue its activities.|$|R

50|$|One {{common use}} of AnywhereTS is {{recycling}} old computers into thin clients. The modest hardware requirements (Pentium II with 32 MB RAM) have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> even <b>for</b> many organizations {{in developing countries}} to convert PCs to thin clients.|$|R
5|$|According to biographer M.D. Gopalakrishnan, Periyar and his {{movement}} achieved a better status {{for women in}} Tamil society. Periyar held that in matters of education and employment {{there should be no}} difference between men and women. Gopalakrishnan states that Periyar's influence in the State departments and even the Center <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> women to join police departments and the army. Periyar also spoke out against child marriage.|$|E
5|$|Marseille {{attacked}} {{under conditions}} many considered unfavourable, but his marksmanship {{allowed him to}} make an approach fast enough to escape the return fire of the two aircraft flying on either flank of the target. Marseille's excellent eyesight <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> him to spot the opponent before he was spotted, allowing {{him to take the}} appropriate action and manoeuvre into position for an attack.|$|E
5|$|Nellie learns of Cable's {{death and}} that Emile is missing. She realizes {{that she was}} foolish to reject Emile because of the race of his children's mother. Bloody Mary and Liat come to Nellie asking where Cable is; Mary {{explains}} that Liat refuses to marry anyone but him. Nellie comforts Liat. Cable and Emile's espionage work has <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> a major offensive, Operation Alligator, to begin. The previously idle fighting men, including Billis, go off to battle.|$|E
50|$|In ancient times, one of {{the most}} direct ways to become a Roman or Greek citizen was by means of a self-sale contract. The laws {{surrounding}} Roman and Greek manumission <b>made</b> <b>it</b> quite <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> such erstwhile slaves to then become citizens or near-citizens themselves.|$|R
50|$|The {{student body}} {{organized}} a fund-raising drive that <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to continue <b>for</b> one more year. In May 1977, the Board {{decided that the}} school would have to close {{at the end of}} that summer.|$|R
50|$|In 1994, then {{commissioned}} in the Russian Northern Fleet, Marshal Ustinov {{was laid}} up {{somewhere in the}} Baltic awaiting extensive repairs.

5|$|The Brethren Court and Beckett's fleets emerge for war. On a sandbank, Elizabeth, Jack, Barbossa, Beckett, Jones, and Will parley, trading Will for Jack, and Barbossa steals Jack's {{piece of}} eight, {{all of which}} are owned by the Pirate Lords and {{required}} to free Calypso. Barbossa frees Calypso, but when Will reveals it was Jones who <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> the first Court to imprison her, Calypso vanishes and summons an enormous maelstrom.|$|E
5|$|The capital, Kolkata, was the {{workplace}} of several social reformers, including Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar, and Swami Vivekananda. Their social reforms {{eventually led to}} a cultural atmosphere that <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> practices like sati, dowry, and caste-based discrimination, or untouchability, to be abolished. The region was also home to several religious teachers, such as Chaitanya, Ramakrishna, Prabhupada, and Paramahansa Yogananda.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} Brazilian dreadnought, Minas Geraes, was launched, the Brazilian {{government}} began an extended campaign {{to remove the}} third dreadnought from the contract because of political—backlash from the Revolt of the Lash coupled with warming relations with Argentina—and economic reasons. After much negotiating and attempts from Armstrong to hold the Brazilian government to the contract, the Brazilians relented, {{due in part to}} lower bond rates that <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> the government to borrow the necessary money. Rio de Janeiro was laid down {{for the first time in}} March 1910.|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of the M8 for Windows was enabled by changes to the Windows Phone platform by Microsoft to allow for more flexibility and variance in hardware designs, such as support for on-screen buttons.

HTC Americas president Jason Mackenzie argued that with the M8 for Windows, HTC was the first smartphone maker to [...] " [...] an iconic device on multiple operating systems without making any compromises." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{not until}} they had left the {{mountain}} behind them, crossed the flat, and {{come out on the}} river by the saw-mill, that the bustle and skurry of human life <b>made</b> <b>it</b> seem <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> them to speak. Corliss had walked with his eyes moodily bent to the ground; and Frona, with head erect and looking everywhere, stealing an occasional glance to his face. Where the road rose over the log run-way of the mill the footing was slippery, and catching at her to save her from falling, their eyes met.|$|R
25|$|In 1998 {{the start}} of the Tour of Flanders moved to Bruges, a UNESCO World Heritage Site known for its illustrious history and medieval architecture, as part of the city's promotional campaign. The move from Sint-Niklaas to Bruges brought {{criticism}} unrelated to the route change. Until then it had been a tradition that spectators could mix and meet with riders before the start. Nonetheless, most Flemish fans and traditionalists were enthusiastic of the new starting place, praising Bruges' historic site and its closeness to the coast, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> again <b>for</b> the race to pass by the seashore.|$|R
5|$|German glass {{ornaments}} {{were introduced}} to America by Frank Woolworth in the 1880s but such ornaments were produced under labor-intensive conditions and were expensive, with few Americans being able to afford {{more than one or}} two ornaments per year. On the eve of World War II, however, American companies began manufacturing inexpensive, mass-produced ornaments that <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> almost any American to have an extensive collection of Christmas ornaments for little cost within moments. With a few modifications, Corning Glass's light bulb machine could spit out 2,000 blank glass ornaments a minute that were then bought by ornament companies to be decorated, packaged and sold by the dozen.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Kenneth Lay merged {{the natural}} gas {{pipeline}} companies of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth to form Enron. In the early 1990s, he helped to initiate the selling of electricity at market prices, and soon after, the United States Congress approved legislation deregulating the sale of natural gas. The resulting markets <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> traders such as Enron to sell energy at higher prices, thereby significantly increasing its revenue. After producers and local governments decried the resultant price volatility and asked for increased regulation, strong lobbying {{on the part of}} Enron and others prevented such regulation.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Ullevaal Stadion AS {{bought the}} West Stand, {{including}} the commercial areas. In March 2001, NFF gave Lyn a loan for NOK12.5 million, {{on the condition}} that if it was not paid back within two years, NFF would take over Lyn's ownership in the stadium. This <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> Lyn to pay their investment company back the debt for the loan, which had increased to this amount in five years, and to purchase the stadium and secure NFF the right of pre-emption. On 4 July 2002, Lyn and NFF announced that NFF would make a private placement of NOK27 million in Ullevaal Stadion AS {{and at the same time}} terminate Lyn's debt. In exchange, Lyn's ownership was reduced to 15%.|$|E
50|$|Until {{the end of}} World War II, only a small wealthy Swedish elite {{could afford}} {{vacation}} houses—often both a large seaside house and a hunting cabin up north. During the rapid urbanisation in the 1950s and 1960s, many families were able to retain their old farmhouses, village cottages and fisherman cabins and convert them into vacation houses. In addition, economic growth <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> even <b>for</b> low income-families to buy small lots in the countryside where they could erect simple houses. Former vacation houses near the large cities have gradually been converted into permanent homes {{as a result of}} urban sprawl.|$|R
50|$|In the 19th century, {{few women}} were sole proprietors of {{businesses}} or professional services like law and medicine. However, many did {{work closely with}} their husbands, fathers, brothers and sons in operating shops and stores. The reform of married women's property law in the 19th century <b>made</b> <b>it</b> legally <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> wives to run businesses independently of their husbands. In reality, however, {{the interpretation of the}} courts made the wife a dependent partner in the marriage who owed her labour and services primarily to her husband. Therefore, most of the women running businesses were widows who had inherited their husband's business.|$|R
5000|$|While {{holding the}} office, {{he was often}} {{mentioned}} as a possible successor to Tito. However, during the 1970s in both LCY and federal state institutions a system of rotating collective leadership evolved that <b>made</b> <b>it</b> hardly <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> any single official to become a new leader after Tito. At the eleventh Congress of LCY in 1978 the Executive Bureau was abolished and although Dolanc was appointed secretary of the CC LCY Presidium, he resigned from this office in May 1979. The resignation is sometimes linked {{to the death of}} Edvard Kardelj of February in the same year, who reportedly had been protecting Dolanc.|$|R
5|$|In {{the same}} year, he {{identified}} the hieroglyphic script on the Rosetta stone as being {{written in a}} mixture of ideograms and phonetic signs, just as Young had argued for Demotic. He reasoned that if the script was entirely ideographic the hieroglyphic text would require as many separate signs as there were separate words in the Greek text. But there were in fact fewer, suggesting that the script mixed ideographic and phonetic signs. This realization finally <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> him to detach himself from the idea that the different scripts had to be either fully ideographic or fully phonetic, and he recognized it as being much more complex mixture of sign types. This realization gave him a distinct advantage.|$|E
5|$|The Dominica National Olympic Committee (NOC) {{selected}} one athlete (Durañona) through qualification standards. NOCs {{may enter}} athletes regardless of time (one athlete per sex) {{if they have}} no athletes meeting the entry standard. This <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> Dominica to have two representatives in the sport. The two athletes that were selected {{to compete in the}} Rio Games were Yordanys Durañona in the men's triple jump and Thea LaFond in the women's triple jump. Durañona was selected as the flag bearer for both the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The Supremes were an American female singing {{group and}} the premier act of Motown Records during the 1960s. Founded as The Primettes in Detroit, Michigan, in 1959, the Supremes were the most commercially {{successful}} of Motown's acts and are, to date, America's most successful vocal group with 12 number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. Most of these hits were written and produced by Motown's main songwriting and production team, Holland–Dozier–Holland. At their peak in the mid-1960s, the Supremes rivaled the Beatles in worldwide popularity, and {{it is said that}} their success <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> future African American R and soul musicians to find mainstream success.|$|E
50|$|After {{the end of}} the Thirty Years' War and its ravages in 1648, {{followed}} by the counter-reformation instigated by the Catholic Church, an explosion of building works took place in the region of Upper Swabia. Immigrants to depopulated areas within Upper Swabia contributed to an economic upturn, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> even <b>for</b> the owners of the smallest villages to secure sufficient funds to restore, extend and enhance the already existing buildings in Baroque style. This included monasteries as well as secular buildings such as castles and commercial buildings. The result of this is today called Upper Swabian Baroque. It lasted from ca. 1650 until the French Revolution.|$|R
40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} of a configuration resembling that of a Cassegrain telescope with two nested mirrors in {{the plane of the}} primary and two nested mirrors in the plane of the secondary. The focal plane was located in the plane of the first and the third mirror. The four surfaces available in the device <b>for</b> corrections <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to correct <b>for</b> third-order spherical aberration, coma, astigmatism, and distortion...|$|R
50|$|Such {{constitutional}} changes <b>made</b> <b>it</b> {{not only}} <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> Henry {{to have his}} marriage annulled but also gave him access to the considerable wealth that the Church had amassed. Thomas Cromwell, as Vicar General, launched a commission of enquiry into the nature and value of all ecclesiastical property in 1535, which culminated in the Dissolution of the Monasteries (1536 - 1540).|$|R
5|$|The most {{masculine}} {{women were}} not necessarily common, though they were visible so they tended to attract women interested in finding other lesbians. Women had to broach the subject about their interest in other women carefully, sometimes taking days to develop a common understanding without asking or stating anything outright. Women who did not enter the military were aggressively called upon to take industrial jobs left by men, {{in order to continue}} national productivity. The increased mobility, sophistication, and independence of many women during and after the war <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> women to live without husbands, something {{that would not have been}} feasible under different economic and social circumstances, further shaping lesbian networks and environments.|$|E
5|$|The trial {{opened on}} June 11, 2007 in Washington, DC. The Cedillos' six expert {{witnesses}} argued that thimerosal-containing vaccines degraded Michelle's immune system, {{which in turn}} <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> the weakened measles virus in the MMR vaccine to cause a persistent infection leading to autism. In support of this hypothesis, the Cedillos' witnesses relied on the reported detection of measles virus in Michelle's gastrointestinal tract by John O'Leary's Unigenetics laboratory in Dublin. However, the government's expert witnesses conclusively demonstrated that O'Leary's positive results were caused by contamination in the Unigenetics lab rather than an actual infection.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days after}} taking office, Alfonsín sent {{a bill to}} the Congress to revoke the self-amnesty law {{established}} by the military. This <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> the judiciary to investigate the crimes committed during the Dirty War. During the campaign, Alfonsín had promised {{that he would do}} this while Luder had been non-committal. Alfonsín also ordered the initiation of judicial cases against guerrilla leaders Mario Firmenich, Fernando Vaca Narvaja, Ricardo Obregón Cano, Rodolfo Galimberti, Roberto Perdía, Héctor Pardo and Enrique Gorriarán Merlo; and military leaders Jorge Videla, Emilio Massera, Orlando Agosti, Roberto Viola, Armando Lambruschini, Omar Graffigna, Leopoldo Galtieri, Jorge Anaya and Basilio Dami Dozo. He also requested the extradition of guerrilla leaders who were living abroad.|$|E
50|$|By the 1950s, {{there was}} {{considerable}} competition among numismatists to be appointed an assay commissioner. Appointees received no compensation, but the appointment was prestigious and carried with it a prized assay medal. The procedure was changed so that the Mint Director submitted the names of more individuals than would actually be appointed to the White House, where the final choices were <b>made.</b> <b>It</b> remained <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> the director to ask for special consideration for certain individuals. Later nominations were also screened by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and by the IRS. The Mint Director received nominations for assay commissioner from legislators, political organizations, government officials, and {{from members of the}} public.|$|R
50|$|In 1890, St. Louis {{industrialist}} N.O. Nelson chose a {{tract of}} land just south of Edwardsville to build plumbing factories. He also built a model workers' cooperative village called Leclaire. He offered workers fair wages with reasonable working hours and {{a share of the}} profits. He named the village in honor of the French economist Edme-Jean Leclaire. The village also provided educational and recreational opportunities and <b>made</b> <b>it</b> financially <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> anyone to own his own home. Unlike company towns such as Pullman near Chicago, this was a company town where the welfare and quality of life for the workers and their families was a major concern.|$|R
5000|$|Previous West German governments, {{especially}} those {{led by the}} Christian Democratic Union, had shown more rhetorical support for the territorial claims made on behalf of German refugees and expellees. Although the Social Democrats showed {{strong support for the}} expellees, especially under Kurt Schumacher and Erich Ollenhauer, Social Democrats in more recent decades have generally been less supportive [...] - [...] and it was under Willy Brandt that West Germany recognized the Oder-Neisse line as the eastern German border with Poland under his policy of Ostpolitik. In reality, accepting the internationally recognized boundary <b>made</b> <b>it</b> more <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> eastern Germans to visit their lost homelands.|$|R
