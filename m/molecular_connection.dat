40|$|PURPOSE: TRPV 4 (transient {{receptor}} potential vanilloid 4 channel) is a nonselective cation channel {{involved in}} different sensory functions that was recently implicated in bladder mechanosensation. We investigated the cellular site of TRPV 4 in bladder urothelium and explored a <b>molecular</b> <b>connection</b> between TRPV 4 and urothelial adherence junctions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained healthy tissues sections from cystectomy in humans due to cancer in 3 and noncancerous conditions in 2. Besides human biopsies tissues from 7 normal and 7 TRPV 4 -/-mice, and the urothelial cell line RT 4 were also used. Experiments {{were done with}} polyclonal antibody against TRPV 4 (against the N-terminus of rat TRPV 4). A <b>molecular</b> <b>connection</b> between TRPV 4 and different adherence junction components was investigated using immunofluorescence, Western blot and immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: Results revealed TRPV 4 on urothelial cell membranes near adherence junctions. Results were comparable in the urothelial cell line, human bladders and mouse bladders. Subsequent immunoprecipitation experiments established a <b>molecular</b> <b>connection</b> of TRPV 4 to alpha-catenin, {{an integral part of}} the adherence junction that catenates E-cadherin to the actin-microfilament network. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide evidence for the location of TRPV 4 in human bladder urothelium. TRPV 4 is molecularly connected to adherence junctions on the urothelial cell membrane. TRPV 4 coupling to a rigid intracellular and intercellular structural network would agree with the hypothesis that TRPV 4 can be activated by bladder stretch...|$|E

40|$|Amino acids are {{not only}} {{substrates}} for various metabolic pathways, but can also serve as signaling molecules controlling signal transduction pathways. One of these signaling pathways is mTOR-dependent and is activated by amino acids (leucine in particular) in synergy with insulin. Activation of this pathway inhibits autophagy. Because activation of mTOR-mediated signaling also stimulates protein synthesis, it appears that protein synthesis and autophagic protein degradation are reciprocally controlled by the same signaling pathway. Recent developments indicate that amino acid-stimulated mTOR-dependent signaling is subject to complex regulation.

Increased expression of FimZ in serovar Typhimurium resulted in bacteria which were hyperfimbriated but were nonmotile in soft agar.

OLR 1 is important for maintaining the transformed state in developmentally diverse cancer cell lines and for tumor growth, suggesting a <b>molecular</b> <b>connection</b> between cancer and atherosclerosis.

40|$|Expression of {{connective}} tissue growth factor (CTGF) in endothelial cells is modulated by shear stress affecting {{the organization of}} the cytoskeleton. The <b>molecular</b> <b>connection</b> between alterations of actin and CTGF expression was investigated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and a microvascular endothelial cell line. Overexpression of nonpolymerizable monomeric actin R 62 D inter-fered with stress fiber formation in HUVEC and concomitantly reduced immunoreactive CTGF. In microvascular endothelial cells, flow-dependent upregulation of CTGF was prevented by this actin mutant. In contrast, overexpression of actin S 14 C strengthened fila-mentous actin and increased CTGF expression. These data indicated an inverse relationship between CTGF expression and monomeric actin. Coexpression of the mutant actins and different CTGF promoter constructs revealed an actin-sensitive site between 3 and 4. 5 kb of the CTGF promoter.

40|$|SummaryThe {{circadian}} {{nature of}} mood and its dysfunction in affective disorders is well recognized, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unclear. Here, {{we show that}} the circadian nuclear receptor REV-ERBα, which is associated with bipolar disorder, impacts midbrain dopamine production and mood-related behavior in mice. Genetic deletion of the Rev-erbα gene or pharmacological inhibition of REV-ERBα activity in the ventral midbrain induced mania-like behavior in association with a central hyperdopaminergic state. Also, REV-ERBα repressed tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene transcription via competition with nuclear receptor-related 1 protein (NURR 1), another nuclear receptor crucial for dopaminergic neuronal function, thereby driving circadian TH expression through a target-dependent antagonistic mechanism. In conclusion, we identified a <b>molecular</b> <b>connection</b> between the circadian timing system and mood regulation, suggesting that REV-ERBα could be targeting {{in the treatment of}} circadian rhythm-related affective disorders...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Multiple enzymes {{participate}} in the phosphorylation {{of a group of}} phosphoinositide lipids.

Loss of their function has been demonstrated to occur as an early event a wide variety of carcinogenesis and has therefore been suggested as a biomarker for the premalignant disease. In addition, genetic alterations at multiple nodes in the pathway have been implicated in several other diseases. Accordingly, given this pervasive involvement in many diseases, the development of molecules that modulates this pathway has been initiated in studies.

40|$|Summaryc-Myc {{is known}} to promote {{glutamine}} usage by upregulating glutaminase (GLS), which converts glutamine to glutamate that is catabolized in the TCA cycle. Here we report that {{in a number of}} human and murine cells and cancers, Myc induces elevated expression of glutamate-ammonia ligase (GLUL), also termed glutamine synthetase (GS), which catalyzes the de novo synthesis of glutamine from glutamate and ammonia. This is through upregulation of a Myc transcriptional target thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), which promotes active demethylation of the GS promoter and its increased expression. Elevated expression of GS promotes cell survival under glutamine limitation, while silencing of GS decreases cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth. Upon GS overexpression, increased glutamine enhances nucleotide synthesis and amino acid transport. These results demonstrate an unexpected role of Myc in inducing glutamine synthesis and suggest a <b>molecular</b> <b>connection</b> between DNA demethylation and glutamine metabolism in Myc-driven cancers...|$|E
40|$|SummaryProliferating {{mammalian}} cells use glutamine as {{a source}} of nitrogen and as a key anaplerotic source to provide metabolites to the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) for biosynthesis. Recently, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC 1) activation has been correlated with increased nutrient uptake and metabolism, but no <b>molecular</b> <b>connection</b> to glutaminolysis has been reported. Here, we show that mTORC 1 promotes glutamine anaplerosis by activating glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). This regulation requires transcriptional repression of SIRT 4, the mitochondrial-localized sirtuin that inhibits GDH. Mechanistically, mTORC 1 represses SIRT 4 by promoting the proteasome-mediated destabilization of cAMP-responsive element binding 2 (CREB 2). Thus, a relationship between mTORC 1, SIRT 4, and cancer is suggested by our findings. Indeed, SIRT 4 expression is reduced in human cancer, and its overexpression reduces cell proliferation, transformation, and tumor development. Finally, our data indicate that targeting nutrient metabolism in energy-addicted cancers with high mTORC 1 signaling may be an effective therapeutic approach...|$|E

In fact, deregulation of neuronal metabolism has been postulated to {{play a key role}} leading to the clinical outcomes observed in AD.

Here we review findings supporting this novel paradigm and further discuss how these mechanisms seem to participate in synapse and cognitive impairments that are germane to AD. These deleterious processes resemble pathways that act in peripheral tissues leading to insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, in an intriguing <b>molecular</b> <b>connection</b> linking AD to diabetes.

As our understanding grows, inflammatory mediators will provide opportunities to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

40|$|During {{inflammation}} and infection, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are stimulated to proliferate and differentiate into mature immune cells, {{especially of the}} myeloid lineage. MicroRNA- 146 a (miR- 146 a) is a critical negative regulator of inflammation. Deletion of miR- 146 a produces effects that appear as dysregulated inflammatory hematopoiesis, leading {{to a decline in}} the number and quality of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), excessive myeloproliferation, and, ultimately, to HSC exhaustion and hematopoietic neoplasms. At the cellular level, the defects are attributable to both an intrinsic problem in the miR- 146 a–deficient HSCs and extrinsic effects of lymphocytes and nonhematopoietic cells. At the molecular level, this involves a molecular axis consisting of miR- 146 a, signaling protein TRAF 6, transcriptional factor NF-κB, and cytokine IL- 6.

40|$|SummaryThe {{transcription}} factor ATF 4 enhances bone formation by favoring amino acid import and collagen synthesis in osteoblasts, a function requiring its phosphorylation by RSK 2, the kinase inactivated in Coffin-Lowry Syndrome. Here, {{we show that}} in contrast, RSK 2 activity, ATF 4 -dependent collagen synthesis, and bone formation are increased in mice lacking neurofibromin in osteoblasts (Nf 1 ob−/− mice). Independently of RSK 2, ATF 4 phosphorylation by PKA is enhanced in Nf 1 ob−/− mice, thereby increasing Rankl expression, osteoclast differentiation, and bone resorption. In agreement with ATF 4 function in amino acid transport, a low-protein diet decreased bone protein synthesis and normalized bone formation and bone mass in Nf 1 ob−/− mice without affecting other organ weight, while a high-protein diet overcame Atf 4 −/− and Rsk 2 −/− mice developmental defects, perinatal lethality, and low bone mass.
