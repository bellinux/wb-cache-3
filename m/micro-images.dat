40|$|In {{less than}} three decades since its {{inception}} in the early 19702 ̆ 7 s, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) {{has become one of the}} most powerful tools for diagnostic imaging. Although MRI has been used to visualize virtually all parts of the human body, only recently has it become feasible to obtain <b>micro-images</b> (on the order of 100 m m) of various structures, largely owing to improvements in MR hardware and software. There is also an increasing demand for more quantitative approaches with MRI which, in the past, has been used primarily as a qualitative diagnostic tool. ^ In this dissertation, the present limits of in vivo high-resolution imaging for quantitative analysis of tissue structure are analyzed, and improved methodology is developed, implemented and evaluated. Current limitations of micro-imaging include intrinsically low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and motional blurring. Low SNR limits the maximum attainable resolution, and the presence of motion often makes the acquired images difficult, if not impossible, to analyze and quantify. Means to improve SNR include construction of optimized radiofrequency coils for signal detection and modification of pulse sequences to minimize signal loss due to relaxation effects. Correction of motional blurring can be achieved with motion compensation techniques such as navigator echoes or autofocusing to retrospectively compensate for motion within the imaging plane. ^ The techniques developed in this thesis are applied to visualize connective tissues, specifically the trabecular structure of bone and the layers of the skin. Micro-imaging of trabecular bone permits determination of structural parameters as a means to predict bone competence and strength. Assessment of bone quality is important for subjects at risk of bone loss and ultimately fracture (osteoporosis), and can be used to evaluate the response to treatment. Non-invasive MRI methods are also desirable for high-resolution imaging of the skin, where other methods, such as ultrasound, are inadequate for reliable detection of various skin structures. <b>Micro-images</b> of the skin may be used to detect abnormalities and may in the future provide critical information for preoperative staging and postoperative follow-up of skin tumors. ...|$|E

Images of virtual sections, both longitudinal and transverse, throughout the grain were collected at intervals {{after the start of}} imbibition and used to reconstruct a picture of water location within the different grain tissues and changes over time. The observations were supplemented by the weighing measurements of water content and imbibition of grains in water containing I 2 /KI which stains starch and lipid, thereby acting as a marker for water. In closely related genotypes, with either a dormant or a non-dormant phenotype, neither the rate of increase in water content nor the pattern of water distribution within the grain was significantly different until 18 h, when germination became apparent in the non-dormant genotype.

However, it was not clear that FcRn expression in aggregated lymphoid nodules area (ALNA) in abomasum, a unique and important mucosal immune structure discovered only in Bactrian camels. In the present study, 27 Alashan Bactrian camels were divided into the following five age groups: fetus (10 – 13 months of gestation), young (1 – 2 years), pubertal (3 – 5 years), middle-aged (6 – 16 years) and old (17 – 20 years). The FcRn expressions were observed and analyzed in detail with histology, immunohistochemistry, <b>micro-image</b> analysis and statistical methods. Results The results showed that the FcRn was expressed in mucosal epithelial cells of ALNA from the fetus to the old group, although the expression level rapidly declined in old group; moreover, after the ALNA maturated, the FcRn expression level in the non-follicle-associated epithelium (non-FAE) was significantly higher than that in FAE (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). In addition, the FcRn was also expressed in the vessel endothelium, smooth muscle tissue, and macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) of secondary lymphoid follicles (sLFs).
