40|$|Different {{efficiency}} enhancement {{techniques for}} a 1. 9 GHz DECT power amplifier (PA) have been investigated.

The analog signal to be amplified is converted to a series of pulses by pulse width modulation, pulse density modulation or other methods before being applied to the amplifier. After amplification, the output pulse train can be converted back to an analog signal by passing through a passive low pass filter consisting of inductors and capacitors.|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} {{electronic}} oscillation, motorboating occurs {{when some of}} the output energy from an amplifying device like a transistor or vacuum tube gets coupled back into the input circuit of the device (or possibly into an earlier stage of the amplifier circuit) with the proper phase for positive feedback. This indicates there is an unwanted feedback path through the circuit from output to input of an amplifying stage. The technical conditions for oscillation, given by the Barkhausen stability criterion, are that the total gain around the feedback loop (comprising the amplifying device and the feedback path) at the oscillation frequency must be one (0 dB), and that the phase shift must be a multiple of 360° (2π radians). Since most <b>amplifying</b> devices, <b>transistors</b> and tubes, are inverting, with the output signal 180° opposite in phase from the input, the feedback path must contribute the other 180° of shift.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the bachelor graduation project detailed in this thesis {{is the development of}} a system suited for testing radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers (PAs). This PA test system is in particular set up for testing two-transistor interpolating-supply amplifiers. Interpolating-supply PAs are efficiency-enhanced by employing multiple transistors supplied by different, fixed drain supply voltages, leading to different efficiency characteristics, which are then combined by switching between the transistors, resulting in an enchanced overal efficiciency. Turning on the right <b>amplifying</b> <b>transistor</b> takes place digitally by pre-adjusting the different data inputs or control of gate biases. The PA test system is required to provide support for measurement and signal generation for 40 dBm output power of a 20 dB gain PA. Moreover, it is required to provide remote control access to the measurement equipment and automation of the tests, implemented in MATLAB. The to-be-measured PA performance metrics were constrained to static tests for drain efficiency, power-added efficiency, AM/AM distortion, total harmonic distortion (THD) and intermodulation distortion (IMD). In order to meet the requirements while making use of the available resources, it was recognized that the following subsystems were necessary: • Baseband signal generation using a DAC; • RF signal generation using a to-be-calibrated IQ modulator; • Pre-amplifier, by own design; and • Spectrum analyzer, controlled remotely. The baseband signal generation subsystem was characterized with respect to noise and gain performance, which resulted in the making of noise-reducing LC low-pass filters. The provided IQ modulators were successfully calibrated for device non-idealities in an automated MATLAB GUI, allowing for clean RF signal generation. Three pre-amplifiers with over 27. 5 dB power gain were realized for sufficient PA input power. A set of MATLAB functions and scripts for the spectrum analyzer and top-level control was written, enabling semi-automatic PA testing. At the time of writing this thesis, the PA test system was put in use to characterize and evaluate two interpolating supply PAs. For automation, another GUI was implemented for the PA test system. The system proved to be able to determine PA input, output and DC power to measure the gain, linearity and efficiency in multiple static tests and for different PA bias conditions. Also THD and IMD for single-transistor were measured using the PA test system. The results were to a realistic extent similar to the simulated PA characteristics, aside from some anomalies which could possibly be explained by PA design implementation mistakes or test system nonidealities...|$|R

40|$|CMOS Active Pixel Sensor (APS) {{takes the}} {{advantage}} of the mature CMOS industry to compete with the Charge-Coupled Devices (CCD). The advantage of CMOS APS includes low supply voltage, high integration, and flexible functions. However, the scaling of conventional CMOS Active Pixel Sensors (APS) {{has been shown to be}} difficult. Besides process optimization issues, one of the major barrier in APS scaling is the limit on the available output swing at reduced power supply. Small output swing has an enormous impact on the signal-to-noise ratio and the dynamic range of the CMOS Active pixels, not only because of the lower allowable signal voltages, but also the larger noise voltages due to lower currents. In the thesis, we propose two new architectures, PMOS-reset APS and Complementary Active Pixel Sensor (CAPS) to overcome the limit of VDD scaling. The design methodology and the trade-offs of the CAPS architecture in term of required power supply, available signal swing, power consumption, pixel size and fill factors with respect to a number of deep submicron technology generations are studied. The PMOS-reset APS is implemented in a hybrid bulk/SOI CMOS active pixel image sensor, in which the photo-diode is build on the bottom substrate, while the reset transistor and the in-pixel <b>amplifying</b> <b>transistor</b> are built on the top silicon film. The performance of this APS is expected to be similar to the bulk technology with potentially higher speed due to the lower capacitance that the photodiode has to drive in SOI technology. At the same time, the doping of the SOI substrate can be arbitrarily low without affecting the CMOS circuit performance. The use of low doping can significantly increase the depletion width for the photo-diode beyond that achievable in bulk technology and leading to higher responsivity. The CAPS pixel has been fabricated with a 0. 25 μm CMOS technology from TSMC and demonstrated to be functional at a VDD below 1 V with 0. 55 V output swing. To our knowledge, it is the first APS operating at such a low VDD is reported. The pixel size is 12 x 10 μm with a fill factor of 30 %.

50|$|PN diodes {{also have}} {{transient}} behaviors {{that might be}} of concern with the design. The capacitance of a PN diode between anode and cathode is inversely proportional to the reverse voltage, growing as it approaches zero volts and into forward bias. There is also a recovery concern where the current will not decrease immediately when it is switched from forward bias to reverse bias. In {{the case of the}} diode OR if two or more of the inputs are at the 1 level and one switches to 0 it will cause a glitch or increase in current in the diodes that remain at 1. This can cause a short term dip in the output voltage. In practice if the diode logic gate drives a transistor inverter, as it usually does, and the diode and transistor are of similar construction the transistor will have a similar base collector capacitance that is <b>amplified</b> by the <b>transistor</b> gain so that it will be too slow to pass the glitch. Only when the diode is of a much slower construction will it become any concern at all. In one unusual design small selenium diode discs were used with germanium transistors.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} novel design methodologies for integrated radiators {{and power}} generation at mm-wave frequencies that are enabled by the continued integration of various electronic and electromagnetic (EM) structures onto the same substrate. Beginning with {{the observation that}} transistors and their connections to EM radiating structures on an integrated substrate are essentially free, the concept of multi-port driven (MPD) radiators is introduced, which opens a vast design space that has been generally ignored due to the cost structure associated with discrete components that favors fewer transistors connected to antennas through a single port. From Maxwell's equations, a new antenna architecture, the radial MPD antennas based {{on the concept of}} MPD radiators, is analyzed to gain intuition as to the important design parameters that explain the wide-band nature of the antenna itself. The radiator is then designed and implemented at 160 GHz in a 0. 13 um SiGe BiCMOS process, and the single element design has a measured effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of + 4. 6 dBm with a total radiated power of 0. 63 mW. Next, the radial MPD radiator is adapted to enable dynamic polarization control (DPC). A DPC antenna is capable of controlling its radiated polarization dynamically, and entirely electronically, with no mechanical reconfiguration required. This can be done by having multiple antennas with different polarizations, or within a single antenna that has multiple drive points, {{as in the case of}} the MPD radiator with DPC. This radiator changes its polarization by adjusting the relative phase and amplitude of its multiple ports to produce polarizations with any polarization angle, and a wide range of axial ratios. A 2 x 1 MPD radiator array with DPC at 105 GHz is presented whose measurements show control of the polarization angle throughout the entire 0 degree through 180 degree range while in the linear polarization mode and maintaining axial ratios above 10 dB in all cases. Control of the axial ratio is also demonstrated with a measured range from 2. 4 dB through 14 dB, while maintaining a fixed polarization angle. The radiator itself has a measured maximum EIRP of + 7. 8 dBm, with a total radiated power of 0. 9 mW, and is capable of beam steering. MPD radiators were also applied in the domain of integrated silicon photonics. For these designs, the driver transistor circuitry was replaced with silicon optical waveguides and photodiodes to produce a 350 GHz signal. Three of these optical MPD radiator designs have been implemented as 2 x 2 arrays at 350 GHz. The first is a beam forming array that has a simulated gain of 12. 1 dBi with a simulated EIRP of - 2 dBm. The second has the same simulated performance, but includes optical phase modulators that enable two-dimensional beam steering. Finally, a third design incorporates multi-antenna DPC by combining the outputs of both left and right handed circularly polarized MPD antennas to produce a linear polarization with controllable polarization angle, and has a simulated gain of 11. 9 dBi and EIRP of - 3 dBm. In simulation, it can tune the polarization from 0 degrees through 180 degrees while maintaining a radiated power that has a 0. 35 dB maximum deviation from the mean. The reliability of mm-wave radiators and power amplifiers was also investigated, and two self-healing systems have been proposed. Self-healing is a global feedback method where integrated sensors detect the performance of the circuit after fabrication and report that data to a digital control algorithm. The algorithm then is capable of setting actuators that can control the performance of the mm-wave circuit and counteract any performance degradation that is observed by the sensors. The first system is for a MPD radiator array with a partially integrated self-healing system. The self-healing MPD radiator senses substrate modes through substrate mode pickup sensors and infers the far-field radiated pattern from those sensors. DC current sensors are also included to determine the DC power consumption of the system. Actuators are implemented in the form of phase and amplitude control of the multiple drive points. The second self-healing system is a fully integrated self-healing power amplifier (PA) at 28 GHz. This system measures the output power, gain and efficiency of the PA using radio frequency (RF) power sensors, DC current sensors and junction temperature sensors. The digital block is synthesized from VHDL code on-chip and it can actuate the output power combining matching network using tunable transmission line stubs, as well as the DC operating point of the <b>amplifying</b> <b>transistors</b> through bias control. Measurements of 20 chips confirm self-healing for two different algorithms for process variation and transistor mismatch, while measurements from 10 chips show healing for load impedance mismatch, and linearity healing. Laser induced partial and total transistor failure show the benefit of self-healing in the case of catastrophic failure, with improvements of up to 3. 9 dB over the default case. An exemplary yield specification shows self-healing improving the yield from 0...|$|R
5000|$|RC {{oscillators}} are a type {{of feedback}} oscillator; they consist of an <b>amplifying</b> device, a <b>transistor,</b> vacuum tube, or op-amp, with some of its output energy fed back into its input through a network of resistors and capacitors, an RC network, to achieve positive feedback, causing it to generate an oscillating sinusoidal voltage. [...] They are used to produce lower frequencies, mostly audio frequencies, in such applications as audio signal generators and electronic musical instruments. [...] At radio frequencies, another type of feedback oscillator, the LC oscillator is used, but at frequencies below 100 kHz {{the size of the}} inductors and capacitors needed for the LC oscillator become cumbersome, and RC oscillators are used instead. [...] Their lack of bulky inductors also makes them easier to integrate into microelectronic devices. Since the oscillator's frequency is determined by the value of resistors and capacitors, which vary with temperature, RC oscillators do not have as good frequency stability as crystal oscillators. The frequency of oscillation is determined by the Barkhausen criterion, which says that the circuit will only oscillate at frequencies for which the phase shift around the feedback loop is equal to 360° (2π radians) or a multiple of 360°, and the loop gain (the amplification around the feedback loop) is equal to one. [...] The purpose of the feedback RC network is to provide the correct phase shift at the desired oscillating frequency so the loop has 360° phase shift, so the sine wave, after passing through the loop will be in phase with the sine wave at the beginning and reinforce it, resulting in positive feedback. [...] The amplifier provides gain to compensate for the energy lost as the signal passes through the feedback network, to create sustained oscillations. As long as the gain of the amplifier is high enough that the total gain around the loop is unity or higher, the circuit will generally oscillate.|$|R
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} impact of recent CMOS process {{technology}} shrinks on analogue integrated circuit design. Two LNAs in a wireless communication application serve as an application example for the investigation. Two LNAs have been implemented in a contemporary 65 nm standard CMOS process technology for usage in a low-cost low-power mobile 2. 5 G GSM receiver front-end. The first LNA serves the GSM low bands whereas the second LNA serves the GSM high bands. The underlying LNA architecture, consisting of two cascaded differential stages with capacitive feedback, achieves appropriate gain, noise and linearity performance at moderate current consumption while omitting die area consuming integrated inductors. The LNAs are embedded into the zero-IF receiver front-end of a complete GSM SoC transceiver solution that will enter mass production {{by the beginning of}} 2009. Due to the manifold interdependencies and interactions with other receiver front-end components like the quadrature down-conversion mixer, the LNAs have been designed and evaluated {{in the context of a}} complete analogue receiver front-end in close cooperation with a business partner from the industrial wireless communication background. The performance specifications for the receiver front-end and the individual circuit blocks have been derived directly from the official 3 GPP GSM system specifications. With the specification requirements in mind it has been elaborated on the choice of a direct-conversion receiver as the most reasonable wireless receiver topology for low-cost mass-production in standard CMOS technologies. Design challenges i. e. {{the impact of}} flicker noise on the receiver sensitivity are countered by an innovative mixer architecture with a passive current-commutating stage and a careful design of the receiver baseband circuit blocks. The developed GSM transceiver is a transfer and adaptation of a 130 nm GSM chip to the special environment introduced by a 65 nm low-power CMOS process technology. Consequently the impact of CMOS technology scaling on analogue and RF circuit design in terms of amplifying potential, noise and linearity performance has been analysed in a profound model based comparison of transistor unit cells and passive components in a 130 nm and a 65 nm CMOS process technology. It is illustrated that the <b>amplifying</b> potential of <b>transistors</b> gM/gDS with minimum gate lengths l is severely deteriorated when going from l= 120 nm to l= 60 nm devices. Moreover, an inferior noise performance is observed for minimum channel length transistor devices. It is also shown that for realistic bias conditions the individual transistor device with l= 60 nm exhibits less odd order distortion than with l= 120 nm. The performance of the designed and implemented analogue circuit blocks of the receiver frontend have been evaluated by pre-layout and post-layout circuit simulation results with a special focus on the LNAs. The LNAs achieve satisfactory S 11 18. 3 dB, CP 1 i> 22. 8 dBm and IIP 3 >- 14. 1 dBm in all four GSM frequency bands. The noise figures are an excellent NF 58. 3 dB and NF 54. 0 dB and NF - 16. 3 dBm while IIP 2 > 42. 2 dBm. The good accordance between simulation results and measurement results gives rise to superior product-ready performance expectations for future testchips. The overall transfer of the receiver front-end under investigation from a 130 nm CMOS technology to a 65 nm technology is considered successful. The work is concluded by a summary of prospects of future CMOS process technology nodes with respect to analogue and RF circuit design. After the constraints and limits of conventional deep sub-micron CMOS devices have been pointed out, light is shed on promising approaches to overcome these roadblocks on the ITRS. The ongoing shrink of CMOS process technologies is driven by the semiconductor manufacturers’ desire to integrate given electrical functionality on less die area and consequently reduce the production costs in mass production. Thus the economical benefits of future CMOS process technology shrinks are briefly investigated. It is stressed that significant economical benefits result only for the miniaturisation of systems with a large amount of digital functionality of extended feature sets...|$|R
