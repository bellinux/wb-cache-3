In this paper, we propose a novel authentication scheme for <b>mobile</b> cloud <b>computing,</b> Message Digest-based Authentication (MDA). Technically, MDA is composed of three phases: registration, authentication, and update. With these phases, MDA utilizes hashing, in addition to traditional user id and password based authentication, to ensure confidentiality and integrity during the authentication process.

25|$|The American {{economist}} and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman {{has suggested that}} he fails {{to understand how the}} short term costs of euro membership to the Finnish economy outweigh the large gains caused by greater integration with the European economy. Krugman notes, that Sweden which has yet to join the single currency, had similar rates of growth compared to Finland for the period since the introduction of the euro. Membership of the euro protects Finland from currency fluctuation, which is particularly important for small member states of the European Union like Finland that are highly integrated into the larger European economy. If Finland had retained its own currency, an unpredictable exchange rates would prevent the country from selling its products at competitive prices on the European market. In fact, business leaders in Sweden, which is obliged to join the euro when its economy has converged with the eurozone, are almost universal in their support for joining the euro. Although Sweden's currency is not officially pegged to the euro like Denmark's currency the Swedish government maintains an unofficial peg. This exchange rate policy has in the short term benefited the Swedish economy in two ways; (1) much of Sweden's European trade is already denominated in euros and therefore bypasses any currency fluctuation and exchange rate losses, (2) it allows Sweden's non euro-area exports to remain competitive by dampening any pressure from the financial markets to increase the value of the currency. Maintaining this balance has allowed the Swedish government to borrow on the international financial markets at record low interest rates and allowed the Swedish central bank to quantitatively ease into a fundamentally sound economy. This has led Sweden's economy to prosper at the expense of less sound economies who have been impacted by the 2008 financial crisis. Sweden's economic performance has therefore been slightly better than Finland's since the financial crisis of 2008. Much of this disparity has, however, been due to the economic dominance of Nokia, Finlands largest company and Finland's only major multinational. Nokia supported and greatly benefited from the euro and the European single market, particularly from a common European digital mobile phone standard (GSM), but it failed to adapt when the market shifted to <b>mobile</b> <b>computing.</b> One reason for the popularity of the euro in Finland is the memory of a 'great depression' which began in 1990, with Finland not regaining it competitiveness until approximately a decade later when Finland joined the single currency. Some American economists like Paul Krugman claim not to understand the benefits of a single currency and allege that poor economic performance is the result of membership of the single currency. These economists do not, however, advocate separate currencies for member states within the American union, many of which have quite disparate economies.|$|E

30|$|Handover {{management}} and interference mitigation {{problems for the}} <b>mobile</b> cloud <b>computing</b> environment were examined in [14]. Thus, a low-complexity management approach is introduced to combine the cloud radio access network with small cells. Fast mobility Internet Protocol version- 6 (FMIPv 6) was introduced to handle the handover process in <b>mobile</b> cloud <b>computing</b> [15]. The protocol reduced the handover latency and packet loss using buffering and tunneling procedures. As a result, these mechanisms work well in the ad hoc wireless network but could suffer in the <b>mobile</b> cloud <b>computing</b> environment [16 – 18]. A service-aware location updated paradigm was introduced to identify the frequency and location of mobile devices without using the periodic registration update (PRU) [19]. A service-oriented architecture was introduced for the heterogeneous cloud network to handle the handover management process, which combines the features of cloud computing and the heterogeneous small cell network. However, the architecture particularly focuses on the cloud computing extenuation management process. A robust architecture that can improve the handover process in the <b>mobile</b> cloud <b>computing</b> environment is urgently needed [20]. Furthermore, adversaries attempt to attack sensitive data during the handover process and slow down the services [21, 22]. As a result, the privacy, integrity and authentication of the legitimate users are compromised [23]. Secure packet authentication was introduced to restrict the access of adversaries to <b>mobile</b> cloud <b>computing</b> during the handover process. However, such authentication provides minimal user-privacy support [24]. The architecture attempts to reduce the handover computational cost but not the energy consumption. Existing proposed mechanisms for the handover process in <b>mobile</b> cloud <b>computing</b> focus on reducing the computational cost, flow of the media contents and network connectivity. Hence, the architecture must properly support the energy-efficient handover process while maintaining secure communications and improving the QoS parameters in <b>mobile</b> cloud <b>computing.</b>|$|R
