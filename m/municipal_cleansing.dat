[...] It developed separately as an industrial area and the site of many Brighton Corporation utilities: the Brighton Dust Destructor, an incinerator for rubbish, was built in 1866, followed by another incinerator in 1898; the Municipal Abattoir was established in 1894; and in the early 20th century a meat market and a <b>municipal</b> <b>cleansing</b> station for the fumigation and delousing of people and property were built nearby. Although they occupy land that was part of the hill, these buildings were considered to be part of neighbouring Hollingdean. Residents of Round Hill, especially those who owned laundries, often complained about the smell and soot from the incinerators.|$|E

40|$|The Faculty of Education in Ljubljana is {{the first}} Slovene faculty {{participating}} in the Ecoschools international programme, the goal {{of which is to}} encourage awareness of sustainable development among students and employees. The faculty established a programme board, who examined the environmental conditions of the faculty. Based on this examination, they designed a work programme that includes activities referring to sustainable attitude towards the use of energy and water, waste management, transport, the health and the well-being of students and employees. Their special attention was focused on ensuring biodiversity. Within the programme, the faculty introduced a system of separate waste collection, which resulted in decreased waste quantity and expenses for the <b>municipal</b> <b>cleansing</b> service. The users of the faculty building are encouraged, with various slogans, to reduce the use of electricity, water and paper. Various campaigns of collecting reusable materials (clothes, toys, plastic bottle caps) have been organised. Biodiversity has been ensured by planting new plants around the Faculty and by eradicating invasive plants. The employees can borrow bicycles for short distance travels. Consumption of Slovene and locally grown food is promoted through our participation in the Dan slovenske hrane (The day of Slovene food) and Tradicionalni slovenski zajtrk (Traditional Slovene breakfast) projects. In terms of the mission of the Faculty of Education, the environmental contents are part of some subjects in various study programmes and inter-subject connections are encouraged as well. In 2014, the Faculty received an international award a green – flag that represents institutions actively supporting the environment and fulfilling FEE (the Foundation for Environmental Education) international criteria...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} the second of two parts. In this part, {{the results of the}} {{analysis}} and evaluation of the proposed framework on integrated municipal solid wastem planning and management (IMSWPM) in developing countries in the Municipality of Bandung are presented. Feasibility analysis for IMSWPM in was hindered by difficulties in quantifying benefits and requirements. In general, our analysis indicated that waste reduction initiatives will be feasible if strong political commitment from the government and funds for conducting public education are available. Source separation initiatives will be feasible if PDK-Bandung is willing to adapt its collection and transportation operation system in particular the collection vehicles. The scheme for employing both local community organizations and the <b>municipal</b> <b>cleansing</b> enterprise in service provision is feasible because it has been implemented and enforced by a municipal law. The feasibility of the proposed arrangement for sorting and recycling centres will be determined by the willingness of the municipal government of Kotamadya Bandung and PDK-Bandung to provide land and to acknowledge waste pickers 2 ̆ 7 involvement. The feasibility of composting initiatives at household, community and municipal levels will depend upon the availability of funds to create and develop markets for compost. Sanitary landfill as a safe disposal option is feasible if additional revenue can be provided for PDK-Bandung. The use of incineration, meanwhile, seems currently infeasible. The sustainability of IMSWPM in the City of Bandung will be determined by several critical factors, such as stakeholders 2 ̆ 7 agreement on the common interest(s) such as vision and mission, availability of sufficient resources (experts, money, support) capability of stakeholders in overcoming barriers to the implementation of IMSWPM, availability of enforcement mechanisms, and existing opportunies for the adoption and implementation of IMSWPM...|$|E
