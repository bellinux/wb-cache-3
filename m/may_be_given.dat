5|$|The {{player is}} usually {{accompanied}} {{by up to}} three artificially intelligent squadmates, who <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> tactical orders such as holding a position, taking cover or rushing enemies. Squadmates may be commanded as a group or individually; for example, one half of a squad {{may be used to}} distract enemies while the other half attacks an objective. Each squad member specializes in weapons, reconnaissance, repairs, demolitions or electronics. Those in the latter four categories <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> special commands, such as repairing a teammate's armor or setting explosive charges. During missions, squad members radio in enemy sightings and status assessments.|$|E
5|$|A {{physician}} will initially assess for Parkinson's {{disease with}} a careful medical history and neurological examination. People <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> levodopa, with any resulting improvement in motor impairment helping {{to confirm the}} PD diagnosis. The finding of Lewy bodies in the midbrain on autopsy is usually considered final proof that the person had PD. The clinical course of the illness over time may reveal it is not Parkinson's disease, requiring that the clinical presentation be periodically reviewed to confirm accuracy of the diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|Antiemetic {{medications}} may {{be helpful}} for treating vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting. Metoclopramide might also be helpful. However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children. The intravenous preparation of ondansetron <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> orally if clinical judgment warrants. Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, {{does not appear to}} have a significant clinical benefit.|$|E
5|$|Disruptive {{coloration}} {{is common}} in military usage, for military vehicles, for firing positions and other installations, and for individual soldiers, where uniforms, equipment such as helmets, and face paint {{may be used to}} break up outlines and features. Disruptive coloration, however, does not always achieve crypsis on its own, as an animal or a military target <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> away by other factors including shape, shine, and shadow.|$|E
5|$|If cancer growth blocks a short {{section of}} bronchus, {{brachytherapy}} (localized radiotherapy) <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> directly inside the airway {{to open the}} passage. Compared to external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy allows a reduction in treatment time and reduced radiation exposure to healthcare staff. Evidence for brachytherapy, however, is less than that for external beam radiotherapy.|$|E

5|$|In Iceland, {{assessment}} and evaluation of pupils is conducted internally, and is not standardised between different institutions. Pupils are given regular reports to grade their progress; however {{the way in which}} this is done varies between schools. For example, a numerical grade could be given, or an oral and written assessment <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>given.</b>|$|E
5|$|Terra Nova {{has been}} cited {{as one of the}} first squad-oriented games with {{three-dimensional}} (3D) graphics; the player is often assisted by artificially intelligent teammates who <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> tactical commands. Conceived by Looking Glass after the completion of their first game, , Terra Nova was subject to a long and difficult development process, caused in part by the production of its full motion video cutscenes. The game's TED engine can render 3D outdoor environments and simulate physics; the latter enables such effects as procedural animation.|$|E
5|$|The player competes against {{computer}} rivals {{named after}} famous computers, real and fictional: these include Holly from Red Dwarf and Deep Thought from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The game is timed with {{days of the}} year, {{and at the end}} of each year (game time), players are judged on their performances, and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> trophies, reputation increases, or cash bonuses.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of DKA is with intravenous fluids and insulin. Depending on the severity, insulin <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> intravenously or by injection under the skin. Usually potassium is {{also needed to}} prevent the development of low blood potassium. Throughout treatment blood sugar and potassium levels should be regularly checked. Antibiotics may be required in those with an underlying infection. In those with severely low blood pH, sodium bicarbonate may be given; however, its use is of unclear benefit and typically not recommended.|$|E
5|$|The {{substances}} {{are applied}} to the skin or dripped into the eyes; injected intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously; inhaled either by placing a mask over the animals and restraining them, or by placing them in an inhalation chamber; or administered orally, through a tube into the stomach, or simply in the animal's food. Doses <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> once, repeated regularly for many months, or for the lifespan of the animal.|$|E

5|$|Thyroid cancers {{are treated}} by {{removing}} the whole or part of thyroid gland. Radioactive Iodine 131 <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> to radioablate the thyroid. Thyroxine is given to replace the hormones lost and to suppress TSH production, as TSH may stimulate recurrence. With {{the exception of the}} rare anaplastic thyroid cancer, which carries a very poor prognosis, most thyroid cancers carry an excellent prognosis and can even be considered curable.|$|E
5|$|Disruptive {{patterns}} use strongly contrasting, non-repeating markings such as spots or stripes {{to break}} up the outlines of an animal or military vehicle, or to conceal telltale features, especially the eyes, as in the common frog. Disruptive patterns may use more than one method to defeat visual systems such as edge detection. Predators like the leopard use disruptive camouflage to help them approach prey, while potential prey like the Egyptian nightjar use it to avoid detection by predators. Disruptive patterning is common in military usage, both for uniforms and for military vehicles. Disruptive patterning, however, does not always achieve crypsis on its own, as an animal or a military target <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> away by factors like shape, shine, and shadow.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation of the cervix is {{referred}} to as cervicitis. This inflammation may be of the endocervix or ectocervix. When associated with the endocervix, it is associated with a mucous vaginal discharge and the sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea. As many as half of pregnant women having a gonorrheal infection of the cervix are asymptomatic. Other causes include overgrowth of the commensal flora of the vagina. When associated with the ectocervix, inflammation may be caused by the herpes simplex virus. Inflammation is often investigated through directly visualising the cervix using a speculum, which may appear whiteish due to exudate, and by taking a Pap smear and examining for causal bacteria. Special tests may be used to identify particular bacteria. If the inflammation is due to a bacterium, then antibiotics <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> as treatment.|$|E
50|$|Aid <b>may</b> <b>be</b> bilateral: <b>given</b> {{from one}} country {{directly}} to another; or it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> multilateral: <b>given</b> by the donor country to an international organisation such as the World Bank or the United Nations Agencies (UNDP, UNICEF, UNAIDS, etc.) which then distributes it among the developing countries. The proportion is currently about 70% bilateral 30% multilateral.|$|R

5|$|NSAIDs are {{the usual}} {{first-line}} treatment for gout. No specific agent is significantly {{more or less}} effective than any other. Improvement may be seen within four hours and treatment is recommended for one to two weeks. They are not recommended, however, in those with certain other health problems, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, kidney failure, or heart failure. While indometacin has historically been {{the most commonly used}} NSAID, an alternative, such as ibuprofen, may be preferred due to its better side effect profile in the absence of superior effectiveness. For those at risk of gastric side effects from NSAIDs, an additional proton pump inhibitor <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>given.</b> There is some evidence that COX-2 inhibitors may work as well as nonselective NSAIDs for acute gout attack with fewer side effects.|$|E
5|$|Rodents have {{sensitive}} olfactory abilities, {{which have}} been used by humans to detect odors or chemicals of interest. The Gambian pouched rat is able to detect tuberculosis bacilli with a sensitivity of up to 86.6%, and specificity (detecting the absence of the bacilli) of over 93%; the same species has been trained to detect land mines. Rats have been studied for possible use in hazardous situations such as in disaster zones. They can be trained to respond to commands, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> remotely, and even persuaded to venture into brightly lit areas, which rats usually avoid.|$|E
5|$|Rule 90 is an {{elementary}} cellular automaton. That {{means that it}} consists of a one-dimensional array of cells, each of which holds a single binary value, either 0 or 1. An assignment of values {{to all of the}} cells is called a configuration. The automaton is given an initial configuration, and then progresses through other configurations in a sequence of discrete time steps. At each step, all cells are updated simultaneously. A pre-specified rule determines the new value of each cell as a function of its previous value and of the values in its two neighboring cells. All cells obey the same rule, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> either as a formula or as a rule table that specifies the new value for each possible combination of neighboring values.|$|E
