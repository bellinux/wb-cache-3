No matter in the T-M model, T-M ARMAX-GARCH model, or H-M ARMAX-GARCH model, this study’s results show that most bond funds do not have selective ability and significant systemic risk and timing ability, except for the H-M model.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{analysis}} was to apply financial investment strategies to an investment fund owned by the University of Arizona’s Department of Finance. Strict guidelines were set {{in place by the}} Investment Policy Statement and followed accordingly. The completed activities helped to reinforce the business curriculum taught in the regular courses in a team setting; this allowed for improved leadership, presentation, and decision-making skills. Research groups were formed and given specific industry sectors to follow. Emphasis was placed on historical asset returns as well as the current economic market structure when applying the investment process and asset allocation concepts. The investment process included four major steps: determining investment objectives, developing asset allocation strategies, portfolio construction and implementation, and ongoing portfolio management. Using the steps highlighted in the Portfolio Management Process resulted in a "top down" method for asset and sector selections and a "bottom up” method for individual security selections. Several relative and absolute valuation methods were learned and applied to both the fixed income and equity <b>markets.</b> <b>Integrity</b> and ethics were also a major focus throughout the year, especially given the weakened state of the financial industry due to these principles being previously compromised...|$|R

40|$|Collusive {{transactions}} {{refer to}} the activity whereby traders use carefully-designed trade to illegally ma- nipulate the market. They do this by increasing specific trading volumes, thus creating a false impression that a market is more active than it actually is. The traders involved in the collusive transactions are termed as collusive clique. The collusive clique and its activities can cause substantial damage to the <b>market’s</b> <b>integrity</b> and attract much attention of the regulators {{around the world in}} recent years. Much of the current research focused on the detection based on a number of assumptions of how a normal market behaves. There is, clearly, a lack of effective decision-support tools with which to identify poten- tial collusive clique in a real-life setting. The study in this paper examined the structures of the traders in all transactions, and proposed two approaches to detect potential collusive clique with their activi- ties. The first approach targeted on the overall collusive trend of the traders. This is particularly useful when regulators seek a general overview of how traders gather together for their transactions. The sec- ond approach accurately detected the parcel-passing style collusive transactions on the market through analysing the relations of the traders and transacted volumes. The proposed two approaches, on one hand, provided a complete cover for collusive transaction identifications, which can fulfil the different types of requirements of the regulation, i. e. MiFID II, on the other hand, showed a novel application of well-known computational algorithms on solving real and complex financial problem. The proposed two approaches are evaluated using real financial data drawn from the NYSE and CME group. Experimental results suggested that those approaches successfully identified all primary collusive clique scenarios in all selected datasets and thus showed the effectiveness and stableness of the novel application...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{agriculture}} {{is a method}} of production that answers to calls for “ethical extensionism” which, abandoning the anthropocentric view, recognizes new moral interests, among which the environment occupies a leading position.

The paper addresses these topics, considering the producer’s viewpoint in terms of entrepreneurial objectives while also verifying whether certain characteristics of organic products can satisfy consumer’s expectations. The conclusion is {{that there can be}} no global market for organic products and, consequently, that the preservation and development of local markets is the only strategy entirely compatible with the principles of environmental ethics.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of the European directive for Markets in Financial Instruments (MiFID, Law n. 164 / 2007) introduced {{a break in the}} Italian securities laws. MiFID’s key objectives are <b>market</b> efficiency, <b>integrity</b> and fairness. The directive introduced measures to increase market integration and liquidity of secondary markets to reach efficiency and integrity goals. In turn, banks and financial firms are asked to operate according to a general duty of fairness and honesty, with particular attention paid to the identification, prevention, management and disclosure of conflicts of interest. These rules should improve investor protection in the Italian financial market, historically characterized by a lower degree of market competition and a lower level of investor education. I collected financial information from 1, 283 bank bonds prospectuses issued in the period 2005 – 2010. I found that before MiFID adoption, bank bonds were issued at a negative spread with respect to the comparable risk-free rate, thus violating the diligence and fairness duties of the banks while acting as protective gatekeepers to their customers. After MiFID adoption, the bank bond spread became positive. However, investor protection was enhanced because of the higher competition of the bond market rather than because of the higher public surveillance of the fairness duties of the issuers...|$|R
40|$|The conference {{sought to}} {{facilitate}} {{an examination of}} our discipline, {{a state of the}} nation, providing possible signposts and directions as to the dominant thinking in marketing over the next decade. Marketing as a discipline has undergone many changes and developments to the current state-of-the-art. Indeed many histories of marketing are cited in the literature, one in particular suggesting that the first incarnation of the practice of marketing proper was in 1631 a French newspaper which carried the first classified advertisements 1. The initial disciplinary developments in marketing were mainly descriptive and {{it was not until the}} 1940 s that theoretical attention by researchers was given; especially the questioning of <b>marketing</b> scientific <b>integrity</b> by Alderson and Cox (1948) and Bartels (1951). Marketing was slow to capitalise on initial developments and, in 1964, Halbert (1964) provided a damning criticism of the discipline on the basis that it had no defensible theory. This was promulgated upon the belief that marketing theory exhibited little if any logical consistency, experimental rigour or adequate philosophical grounding. The theoretical foundation of marketing was so scant that Bartels (1974) concluded that there was an “identity crisis ” (p. 73) in marketing. Since this time, the contributions to the field of marketing have proliferated to such a...|$|R
40|$|Book synopsis: The {{financial}} {{system and its}} regulation have undergone exponential growth and dramatic reform over the last thirty years. This period has witnessed major developments in the nature and intensity of financial markets, as well as repeated cycles of regulatory reform and development, often linked to crisis conditions. The recent financial crisis has led to unparalleled interest in financial regulation from policymakers, economists, legal practitioners, and the academic community, and has prompted large-scale regulatory reform. The Oxford Handbook of Financial Regulation is the first comprehensive, authoritative, and state-of-the-art account {{of the nature of}} financial regulation. Written by an international team of leading scholars in the field, it takes a contextual and comparative approach to examine scholarly, policy, and regulatory developments in the past three decades. The first three Parts of the Handbook address the underpinning horizontal themes which arise in financial regulation: {{financial system}}s and regulation; the organization of financial system regulation, including regional examples from the EU and the US; and the delivery of outcomes and regulatory techniques. The final three Parts address the major reoccurring objectives of financial regulation, widely regarded as the anchors of financial regulation internationally: financial stability; <b>market</b> efficiency, <b>integrity,</b> and transparency; and consumer protection. The Oxford Handbook of Financial Regulation will be an invaluable resource for scholars and students of financial regulation, and for economists, policy-makers and regulators...|$|R
