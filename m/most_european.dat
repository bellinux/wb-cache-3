5|$|Gens was a Zionist, {{and was a}} {{follower}} of the Revisionist Zionism school, which called for <b>most</b> <b>European</b> Jews to immediately emigrate to create the State of Israel in what were then the League of Nations mandates of Palestine and Trans-Jordan. He belonged to Brith ha-Hayal, a Jewish organization for military reservists.|$|E

The film topped the Chinese box office in October 2006 and despite not being given a release in <b>most</b> <b>European</b> and North American countries, it grossed over US$20 million worldwide.|$|E
50|$|There {{was minimal}} {{immigration}} to New Zealand directly after 1769 when Captain James Cook discovered New Zealand. Between 1805 and 1835 the European population grew very slowly. <b>Most</b> <b>Europeans</b> were itinerant sailors. The Bay of Islands and the Hokianga in Northland had the <b>most</b> <b>Europeans</b> with about 200 in the 1830s. Because there were almost no European women, European men lived with Maori {{women and the}} population of part Europeans grew faster than the purely European population. Before 1835, most migrants were runaway sailors, escaped convicts, sealers, whalers and missionaries with their families. Initially <b>most</b> part <b>European</b> children grew up mainly as Maori, but able to speak fluent English. Some of these children were sent to Australia by their fathers to receive a formal education.|$|R

The club's record appearance maker is Ian Callaghan, who made 857 appearances between 1958 and 1978. Ian Rush is the club's record goalscorer, scoring 346 goals in total.|$|E
5|$|After a poor {{start to}} the 2004–05 season, Graeme Souness {{replaced}} Sir Bobby Robson as Newcastle manager. Given overtook Alan Shearer as having played in the <b>most</b> <b>European</b> matches for the club on 16 September 2004 {{in a game against}} Bnei Sakhnin, and Given's 12 European and 3 FA Cup appearances helped Newcastle reach the UEFA Cup quarter-final and the FA Cup semi-final. Given missed two Premier League games as the club finished in 14th place.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, the {{geography}} dictated a dispersed economy and population. As a result, the traditional Norwegian farm culture remained strong, and Norway differed from <b>most</b> <b>European</b> countries in never adopting feudalism. This, {{combined with the}} ready availability of wood as a building material, ensured that relatively few examples of the Baroque, Renaissance, and Rococo architecture styles so often built by the ruling classes elsewhere in Europe, were constructed in Norway.|$|E
5000|$|Because South Carolina {{was more}} populous and more commercially important, <b>most</b> <b>Europeans</b> thought {{primarily}} of it, {{and not of}} North Carolina, when they referred to [...] "Carolina".

Though <b>most</b> <b>Europeans</b> would say that Filipinos are music-loving people, traditional music is always {{at risk of being}} left in oblivion.|$|R
5|$|European music between 800 and 1100 {{became more}} sophisticated, more {{frequently}} requiring instruments capable of polyphony. The 9th-century Persian geographer Ibn Khordadbeh mentioned in his lexicographical discussion of music instruments that, in the Byzantine Empire, typical instruments included the urghun (organ), shilyani (probably {{a type of}} harp or lyre), salandj (probably a bagpipe) and the lyra. The Byzantine lyra, a bowed string instrument, is an ancestor of <b>most</b> <b>European</b> bowed instruments, including the violin.|$|E
5|$|Founded on 6 March 1902 as Madrid Football Club, {{the club}} has {{traditionally}} worn a white home kit since inception. The word Real is Spanish for Royal and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. The team has played its home matches in the 81,044-capacity Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike <b>most</b> <b>European</b> sporting entities, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history.|$|E
5|$|Given these risks, as {{smallpox}} became effectively eradicated and {{the number}} of naturally occurring cases fell below the number of vaccine-induced illnesses and deaths, routine childhood vaccination was discontinued in the United States in 1972, and was abandoned in <b>most</b> <b>European</b> countries in the early 1970s. Routine vaccination of health care workers was discontinued in the U.S. in 1976, and among military recruits in 1990 (although military personnel deploying to the Middle East and Korea still receive the vaccination). By 1986, routine vaccination had ceased in all countries. It is now primarily recommended for laboratory workers at risk for occupational exposure.|$|E

5000|$|A common {{measure of}} how close to a [...] "cashless society" [...] a country is {{becoming}} is some measure {{of the number of}} cashless payments or person to person transactions are done in that country. For instance the Nordic countries conduct more cashless transactions than <b>most</b> <b>Europeans.</b>|$|R
5|$|Greenlandic is an ergative language. This means that, {{instead of}} {{treating}} the grammatical relations as in <b>most</b> <b>European</b> languages where grammatical subjects are marked with nominative case and objects with accusative, the grammatical roles are defined differently. In Greenlandic the ergative case {{is used for}} agents of transitive verbs and for possessors. Absolutive case is used for patients of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs. Research into Greenlandic as used by the younger generation {{has shown that the}} use of ergative alignment in Kalaallisut may be becoming obsolete, converting the language into a nominative–accusative language.|$|E
5|$|Historically, <b>most</b> <b>European</b> newts were {{included}} in the genus, but taxonomists have split off the alpine newts (Ichthyosaura), the small-bodied newts (Lissotriton) and the banded newts (Ommatotriton) as separate genera. The closest relatives of Triturus are the European brook newts (Calotriton). Two species of marbled newts and seven species of crested newts are accepted, of which the Anatolian crested newt was only described in 2016. Their ranges are largely contiguous but where they do overlap, hybridisation may take place.|$|E
5|$|Like <b>most</b> <b>European</b> {{restaurant}}s, La Caravelle had a {{menu that}} changed daily. This made the restaurant popular with new customers and also {{brought them back}} regularly. Salvador Dalí, John Lindsay, Leland Hayward and Dorothy Kilgallen often dined at the restaurant in its early years. The journalist and broadcaster Walter Cronkite was a regular visitor to La Caravelle and enjoyed eating pike quenelles in lobster cream sauce. Other frequent visitors included the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and Marlene Dietrich.|$|E

50|$|The Hispanos of New Mexico are the {{descendants}} of the Spanish and Mexican colonists who settled the area of New Mexico and Southern Colorado. From 1598 to 1848, <b>most</b> <b>Europeans</b> who settled in New Mexico in order to colonize areas of it place were Spanish (and later Mexican).|$|R
50|$|This {{was part}} of the large {{territory}} occupied and controlled by the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy as well established before any <b>European</b> colonization. <b>Most</b> <b>Europeans</b> during the colonial period did not penetrate this far west but had relations with the Mohawk nation to the East for trading.|$|R
5|$|Many Portuguese colonials {{were not}} typical {{settlers}} in Mozambique. While <b>most</b> <b>European</b> communities in Africa {{at the time}} - {{with the possible exception}} of Afrikaners - were established from the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries, some white families and institutions in those territories still administered by Portugal had been entrenched for generations. Loss of their privileged status and fears of FRELIMO reprisal resulted in an exodus of up to 200,000 white civilians at independence (in Europe they were popularly known as retornados). Cities, towns and villages saw their Portuguese names changed after independence - Lourenço Marques to Maputo, Vila Pery to Chimoio, Vila Cabral to Lichinga, or Vila Junqueiro to Gurúè.|$|E
5|$|North American red foxes, {{particularly}} those of northern Alaska, are the most valued for their fur, as they have guard hairs of a silky texture, which, after dressing, allow the wearer unrestricted mobility. Red foxes living in southern Alaska's coastal areas and the Aleutian Islands are an exception, as they have extremely coarse pelts that rarely exceed one-third {{of the price of}} their northern Alaskan cousins. <b>Most</b> <b>European</b> peltries have coarse-textured fur compared to North American varieties. The only exceptions are the Nordic and Far Eastern Russian peltries, but they are still inferior to North American peltries in terms of silkiness.|$|E
