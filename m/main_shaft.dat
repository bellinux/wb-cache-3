5|$|According to Admiral Kummetz' report, {{the first}} torpedo hit Kesselraum 2 (boileroom 2, {{just under the}} funnel) and the second hit Turbinenraum 2/3 (the turbine room for the side shafts). Boiler 1 had already been {{destroyed}} by gunfire. Only one boiler remained, but the steam pipes through boiler 1 and 2 and turbine room 2/3 had been damaged and turbine 1 for the <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> lost its power. By 04:34, the ship had been severely damaged, but had successfully passed through the firing zone; the Norwegian guns could no longer bear on her. The 15cm guns in the Kopås battery were all standing in open positions with a wide sector of firing. After the torpedo hits, Blücher was still within range. The battery asked for orders, but Eriksen concluded: The fortress has served its purpose. With all propellers stopped, about 60% of the electric power gone, Blucher quickly lost speed and at about 04:50 dropped anchors at Askoholmene.|$|E

50|$|N'Chwaning is {{considered}} a single vertical hoist shaft. N'Chwaning II is a vertical skip shaft, currently still in production with an underground crushing facility. N'Chwaning III has two <b>main</b> <b>shafts</b> - A vertical personnel shaft and a decline shaft. N'Chwaning III additionally has seven underground silos for storing different grades of ore.|$|R
25|$|While Babbage's {{original}} design placed the crank {{directly on the}} <b>main</b> <b>shaft,</b> it was later realized that the force required to crank the machine {{would have been too}} great for a human to handle comfortably. Therefore, the two models that were built incorporate a 4:1 reduction gear at the crank, and four revolutions of the crank are required to perform one full cycle.|$|E
25|$|By 1875, Charlemont's {{industrial}} base {{was limited to}} several sawmills, two scythe snathes (handles) shops and a chair making operation. With the opening and success of the Davis iron pyrite and talc mine in Rowe in the 1880s, a prospecting craze developed in the area. In 1892 the <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> was 501 feet deep, and production {{was reported to be}} 334,552 tons of pyrite.|$|E
25|$|The <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> is crossed by four arms, {{that are}} sculpted in zoomorphic images, where rings were fixed {{to hold the}} prisoners, still {{preserving}} their holes. Between each arm are zoomorphic or anthropomorphic representations, leading Louis Key to include this example in the pillories featuring mythological scenes or punishment. Although {{the establishment of the}} pillory dated to the 13th century, this representation is actually from the 16th century, when the final charter from D. Manuel as established.|$|E
50|$|In the {{following}} years it was expanded and connected to other mines. Since 1729 it has been connected to the pit Wennsglückt. At this time the 25 mines in Sankt Andreasberg had their highest output. The <b>main</b> <b>shafts</b> of the mines Sankt Andreas and König Ludwig had a depth of 400 m.|$|R
50|$|There were mining {{activities}} {{in the area for}} centuries before the two <b>main</b> <b>shafts,</b> which formed Baddesley Colliery, were sunk in 1850. Although called Baddesley Colliery it was actually just over the border in Baxterley. From then on until 1989 when the pit closed most Baddesley men worked in some capacity at the mine.|$|R
50|$|Kellingley’s two <b>main</b> <b>shafts</b> {{were each}} almost 870 yd deep. One {{was used to}} move men and materials, and the second to move coal from the Beeston seam, {{at a rate of}} up to 900 tonnes an hour. Kellingley {{primarily}} supplied local power stations. It also produced some housecoal-quality coal: larger-sized coals of higher calorific value.|$|R
25|$|On July 17, the <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> {{reached under}} the Confederate position. Rumors of a mine {{construction}} soon reached the Confederates, but Lee {{refused to believe}} or act upon it for two weeks before commencing countermining attempts, which were sluggish and uncoordinated, and were unable to discover the mine. General John Pegram, whose batteries would be above the explosion, did, however, take the threat seriously enough {{to build a new}} line of trenches and artillery points behind his position as a precaution.|$|E
25|$|During its 29-year working life, the Davis Mine pumped {{thousands}} of tax {{dollars into the}} town’s coffers, and became a local tourist attraction as well. Visitors could climb an observation tower above the <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> for {{a panoramic view of}} the bustling operation, which featured on-site blacksmith and butcher shops, a steady traffic of horse-drawn ore and coal wagons and the town’s first electric lighting. The annual payroll amounted to $100,000, and local farmers made extra income supplying the mine with timber and firewood, while selling fruit, vegetables and dairy products to the workers.|$|E
25|$|In 1894 {{the mine}} {{was sold to}} an English company, Croydon Consols Limited (nominal capital of £100,000 in 400,000 shares), for £16,000, to be paid in instalments. The new company managed the mine well, {{straightening}} and timbering the shaft, erecting a headframe and introducing steel buckets in place of greenhide. In 1896 the <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> was sunk to 380 feet (116m), making Golden Gate Consols the deepest mine on the field. In that year the mine produced 22,815 ounces of gold, which enabled the company to declare a dividend of £28,000 - in excess of profits obtained from any mine on the Croydon goldfield to that date. The following year the company undertook further sinking and produced 11,390 ounces of gold from 2,871 tons of quartz.|$|E

25|$|A {{gyratory crusher}} {{is one of}} the main types of primary crushers in a mine or ore {{processing}} plant. Gyratory crushers are designated in size either by the gape and mantle diameter or by the size of the receiving opening. Gyratory crushers can be used for primary or secondary crushing. The crushing action is caused by the closing of the gap between the mantle line (movable) mounted on the central vertical spindle and the concave liners (fixed) mounted on the main frame of the crusher. The gap is opened and closed by an eccentric on the bottom of the spindle that causes the central vertical spindle to gyrate. The vertical spindle is free to rotate around its own axis. The crusher illustrated is a short-shaft suspended spindle type, meaning that the <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> is suspended at the top and that the eccentric is mounted above the gear. The short-shaft design has superseded the long-shaft design in which the eccentric is mounted below the gear.|$|E
25|$|The keel {{consisted}} of wooden beams bound together with iron hoops. In stormy weather, {{holes in the}} prow would partially fill with water when the ship pitched forward, thus lessening the violent turbulence caused by waves. Treasure ships also used floating anchors cast off {{the sides of the}} ship in order to increase stability. The stern had two 2.5 m (8 foot) iron anchors weighing over a thousand pounds each, used for mooring offshore. Like many Chinese anchors, these had four flukes set at a sharp angle against the <b>main</b> <b>shaft.</b> Watertight compartments were also used to add strength to the treasure ships. The ships also had a balanced rudder which could be raised and lowered, creating additional stability like an extra keel. The balanced rudder placed as much of the rudder forward of the stern post as behind it, making such large ships easier to steer. Unlike a typical fuchuan warship, the treasure ships had nine staggered masts and twelve square sails, increasing its speed. Treasure ships also had 24 cast-bronze cannons with a maximum range of 240 to 275 m (800–900feet). However, treasure ships were considered luxury ships rather than warships. As such, they lacked the fuchuan's raised platforms or extended planks used for battle.|$|E
500|$|Since the prison's closure {{the water}} supply system {{including}} the tunnels, were the subject of heritage studies, including a 2004 inspection by the Western Australia Maritime Museum. The tunnels were re-opened in mid-2005, and within one year the <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> had been refurbished, including [...] "installation of audio-visual equipment, railings and lighting {{as well as the}} removal of debris from the access shaft and tunnels, the creation of new steel platforms and ladders and the addition of extra limestone rocks in the tunnels to help lift users out of the water." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{chatter mark}} {{vibration}} {{generated in the}} rolling process of the twenty-high roll mill not only significantly affects the mill performance, but also reduces surface quality of the strip steel. To identify the excitation source, the online monitor for the real time torsional strain of the <b>main</b> drive <b>shaft</b> is performed for a Sendzimir twenty-high roll mill. A corresponding relationship between the torsion variation of the <b>main</b> drive <b>shaft</b> and the period variation of the working roller is observed. The dynamic rolling skid model is further established and the torsion variation of the <b>main</b> drive <b>shaft</b> is simulated. The calculated results are compared with the measured torsion variation signal of the <b>main</b> drive <b>shaft</b> for without chatter mark vibration. The corresponding characteristics between the chatter mark vibration and the rolling skid is obtained. The results not only support the effective of the established model, but also reveal {{the relationship between the}} chatter mark vibration and the rolling skid, which provides for the development of monitoring method for the chatter mark vibration of the twenty-high roll mill...|$|R

50|$|In the 20th {{century the}} mines were {{operated}} by several companies, including the Metalúrgica Mexicana subsidiary of American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO) beginning in 1928. A miners' strike occurred in 1948 for improved conditions and pay, but the miners lost. ASARCO decided to leave, {{but not before}} destructively collapsing the <b>main</b> <b>shafts</b> and tunnels, though the mines were never declared exhausted.

500|$|Francis Taylor is {{the first}} {{recorded}} fatality at the colliery, killed by a roof fall at [...] "Bradford coal pitt" [...] in 1622. Although the mines were relatively gas-free, there were nevertheless some gas-related incidents. One collier, working {{by the light of}} a candle in 1874, died from burns received in an explosion of firedamp. In 1907 a miner died in a shotfiring incident, when gas exploded as a fuse was lit. In 1924 a number of tubs transporting miners being hauled to the surface derailed and dislodged a pit prop, causing a roof collapse, known locally as a crump; three men were killed and nine injured. The heat from a fire in the main winding engine house in 1953 caused the winding cables to snap, sending two coal-carrying cages crashing {{to the bottom of the}} <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> and trapping 350men underground.

500|$|Epidermal growths {{that form}} the {{distinctive}} outer covering, or plumage, on birds. They are considered the most complex integumentary structures found in vertebrates, and, indeed, a premier example of a complex evolutionary novelty. Feathers are among the characteristics that distinguish the extant birds from other living groups. Although feathers cover {{most parts of the}} body of birds, they arise only from certain well-defined [...] on the skin. They aid in flight, thermal insulation and waterproofing, with their colouration helping in communication and protection. Although there are many subdivisions of feathers, at the broadest levels, feathers are either classified as , which cover the exterior of the body and include , and [...] which grow underneath the vaned feathers. A third rarer type of feather, the , is hairlike and (if present in a bird; they are entirely absent in ratites) grows alongside the contour feathers.
