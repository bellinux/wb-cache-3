25|$|Such large platters {{were never}} used with <b>microprocessor-based</b> systems. With {{increasing}} sales of microcomputers having built in floppy-disk drives (FDDs), HDDs {{that would fit}} to the FDD mountings became desirable. Thus HDD Form factors, initially followed those of 8-inch, 5.25-inch, and 3.5-inch floppy disk drives. Because there were no smaller floppy disk drives, smaller HDD form factors developed from product offerings or industry standards.|$|E
25|$|A <b>microprocessor-based</b> digital {{protection}} relay can replace {{the functions of}} many discrete electromechanical instruments. These relays convert voltage and currents to digital form and process the resulting measurements using a microprocessor. The digital relay can emulate functions of many discrete electromechanical relays in one device, simplifying protection design and maintenance. Each digital relay can run self-test routines to confirm its readiness and alarm if a fault is detected. Digital relays can also provide functions such as communications (SCADA) interface, monitoring of contact inputs, metering, waveform analysis, and other useful features. Digital relays can, for example, store multiple sets of protection parameters, which allows {{the behavior of the}} relay to be changed during maintenance of attached equipment. Digital relays also can provide protection strategies impossible to implement with electromechanical relays. This is particularly so in long distance high voltage or multi-terminal circuits or in lines that are series or shunt compensated They also offer benefits in self-testing and communication to supervisory control systems.|$|E

2500|$|The early 1980s saw {{the rise}} of bass synthesizers, the most {{influential}} being the Roland TB-303, a bass synthesizer and sequencer released in late 1981 that later became a fixture in electronic dance music, particularly acid house. One {{of the first to}} use it was Charanjit Singh in 1982, though it wouldn't be popularized until Phuture's [...] "Acid Tracks" [...] in 1987. Music sequencers began being used around the mid 20th century, and Tomita's albums in mid-1970s being later examples. In 1978, Yellow Magic Orchestra were using computer-based technology in conjunction with a synthesiser to produce popular music, making their early use of the <b>microprocessor-based</b> Roland MC-8 Microcomposer sequencer.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Microprocessor-based</b> digital {{protection}} relays now emulate the original devices, {{as well as}} providing types of protection and supervision impractical with electromechanical relays. Electromechanical relays provide only rudimentary indications of involved phase and zone targets.

By combining several functions in one case, numerical relays also save capital cost and maintenance cost over electromechanical relays. However, due to their very long life span, tens of thousands of these [...] "silent sentinels" [...] are still protecting transmission lines and electrical apparatus all over the world. Important transmission lines and generators have cubicles dedicated to protection, with many individual electromechanical devices, or one or two microprocessor relays.|$|E
2500|$|The band often {{utilized}} a {{wide variety}} of state-of-the-art electronic music equipment immediately as they were made available. Yellow Magic Orchestra and Ryuichi Sakamoto's Thousand Knives were one of the earliest popular music albums to utilize the Roland MC-8 Microcomposer, which was programmed by Hideki Matsutake during recording sessions. Roland called the MC-8 a [...] "computer music composer" [...] {{and it was the first}} stand-alone <b>microprocessor-based</b> music sequencer. It also introduced features such as a keypad to enter note information and 16 KB of RAM which allowed a maximum sequence length of 5200 notes, a huge step forward from the 8–16 step sequencers of the era. While it was commercially unsuccessful due to its high price, the band were among the few bands at the time to utilize the MC-8, which they described as, along with its music programmer Hideki Matsutake, an [...] "inevitable factor" [...] in both their music production and live performances.|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of the 16-cylinder EMD 50 and 60 series locomotives in the late 1970s and early 1980s was spurred {{by the introduction of}} [...] 16-cylinder GE B36-7 (B-B) and GE C36-7 (C-C) locomotives by EMD's main competitor General Electric. EMD previously manufactured the [...] 20-cylinder SD45 and SD45-2 locomotives, but they had a reputation for high fuel consumption. [...] In 1980, the SD50 model was added to the EMD Catalog. [...] However, the SD50's electrical reliability was poor and, similarly, the [...] 16-645F engine had poor mechanical reliability, both believed to be largely due to excessive vibration from the 950 maximum rpm of the 645F prime mover. It was time to develop a replacement for the venerable 645 engine which, in its earlier 16-645E form, had proved to be exceptionally reliable. [...] EMD therefore quickly commenced {{development of}} the SD60 series, which would eliminate the weaknesses of the SD50. The lessons learned in developing the 645F crankcase and crankshaft (for the earlier 20-645E, and the then-current 16-645F) were incorporated in the replacement, the 710G, first employed in the SD60. [...] Although the carbody and frame are nearly indistinguishable from the earlier SD50, the SD60 featured the new 16-cylinder EMD 710G3A prime mover, AR-11 traction alternator, D-87 traction motors and a <b>microprocessor-based</b> control system that governed various electrical systems within the locomotive (e.g., wheel slip and transition).|$|E
2500|$|Sakamoto first {{worked with}} Hosono {{as a member}} of his live band in 1976, while Yukihiro Takahashi {{recruited}} Sakamoto to produce his debut solo recording in 1977 following the split of the Sadistic Mika Band. Hosono invited both to work on his exotica-flavoured album Paraiso, which included electronic songs produced using various electronic equipment. The band was named [...] "Harry Hosono and the Yellow Magic Band" [...] as a satire of Japan's obsession with black magic at the time, and in late 1977 they began recording Paraiso, which was released in 1978. The three worked together again for the 1978 album Pacific, which included an early version of the song [...] "Cosmic Surfin". Hosono and Sakamoto also worked together alongside Hideki Matsutake in early 1978 for Hosono's experimental [...] "electro-exotica" [...] fusion album Cochin Moon, which fused electronic music with Indian music, including an early [...] "synth raga" [...] song [...] "Hum Ghar Sajan". The same year, Sakamoto released his own solo album, The Thousand Knives of Ryuichi Sakamoto, experimenting with a similar fusion between electronic music and traditional Japanese music in early 1978. Hosono also contributed to one of Sakamoto's songs, [...] "Thousand Knives", in the album. Thousand Knives was also notable for its early use of the <b>microprocessor-based</b> Roland MC-8 Microcomposer music sequencer, with Matsutake as its music programmer for the album.|$|E
