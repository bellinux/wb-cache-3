The analysis finds evidence that financial variables are more important in predicting credit ratings for firms likely to face financing constraints. We conclude that the financing constraint is an important dimension in the <b>market</b> <b>implied</b> ratings process.

40|$|Ait-Sahalia and Lo (2000) and Panigirtzoglou and Skiadopoulos (2004) {{have argued}} that Economic VaR (E-VaR), {{calculated}} under the option <b>market</b> <b>implied</b> risk neutral density is a more relevant measure of risk than historically based VaR. As industry practice requires VaR at high confidence level of 99 %, we propose Extreme Economic Value at Risk (EE-VaR) as a new risk measure, based on the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. Markose and Alentorn (2005) have developed a GEV option pricing model and shown that the GEV implied RND can accurately capture negative skewness and fat tails, with the latter explicitly determined by the <b>market</b> <b>implied</b> tail index. Here, we estimate the term structure of the GEV based RNDs, which allows us to calibrate an empirical scaling law for EE-VaR, and thus, obtain daily EE-VaR for any time horizon. Backtesting results for the FTSE 100 index from 1997 to 2003, show that EE-VaR has fewer violations than historical VaR. Further...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} a switching autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic {{time series}} model for returns {{on the daily}} German stock market index. Volatility clustering is captured by persistent periods of different volatility levels and by the dependence on past innovations. We introduce a leverage term to model the asymmetric response of volatility to shocks. Model specification and estimation is performed within a Bayesian framework using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation methods. Model diagnostics document a good fit of the switching ARCH model. The persistence of shocks in volatility coming from the autoregressive conditional part of the variance is considerably lower than that obtained using a GARCH(1, 1) model. Our volatility estimate closely follows <b>market</b> <b>implied</b> volatility. When we compare the forecasting performance, switching ARCH {{turns out to be}} an unbiased estimator of realized volatility. Nevertheless, over all forecast horizons, model-based volatility forecasts do not add information about future volatility. Up to a 7 -day horizon, <b>market</b> <b>implied</b> volatility already contains nearly all information. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we apply the multivariate {{construction}} for Lévy processes introduced by Ballotta and Bonfiglioli (2014) to propose an integrated {{model for the}} joint dynamics of FX exchange rates and asset prices. We show that the proposed construction is consistent in terms of symmetries with respect to inversion and triangulation, and provides an insight into the quanto adjustment showing that this is affected by higher order cumulants of the pure jump part of the systematic risk factor. Using the Esscher transform, we relate Quanto options to vanilla call and put options, which allows for a fast calibration method to the vanilla and the Quanto market. As Quanto products offer significant exposure to the correlation between exchange rates and asset prices, they allow access to a <b>market</b> <b>implied</b> measure of this correlation. By means of a joint calibration exercise to the CME USD denominated Quanto futures on the Nikkei 225 index and both the Nikkei 225 and USDJPY <b>market</b> <b>implied</b> volatilities, we illustrate this approach for the {{case in which the}} driving process is assumed to be a Variance Gamma process...|$|E
40|$|We study pricing {{under the}} local volatility. Our {{research}} is mainly intended for pedagogical purposes. In {{the first part}} of our work we study the local volatility modeling. We derive the local volatility formula in terms of the European call prices {{and in terms of the}} <b>market</b> <b>implied</b> volatilities. We propose and calibrate to the DAX option data a functional form for the implied volatility which simplifies pricing under the local volatility. In the second part of our work we analyze pricing of vanilla and double barrier options under the local volatility. To carry out our analysis of the pricing problem, we code three finite-difference solvers to compute vanilla and double barrier option prices using the local volatility function. At first, we verify that the local volatility solver produces vanilla prices which are exactly compatible with the Black-Scholes prices. Then we compare prices of double barrier options which are computed using <b>market</b> <b>implied</b> volatility and the corresponding local volatility. We find that using the local volatility yields prices and deltas of double barriers which are considerably higher than those computed usin...|$|E
