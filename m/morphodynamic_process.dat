When both effects are brought into interaction, they constrain each other into a particular geometric form because that form facilitates minimal interference between the two processes. The orderly hexagonal form is stable as long as the energy differential persists, and yet the orderly form more effectively degrades the energy differential than any other form.

The model predictions suggest that the long-term morphological changes in the Clyde Estuary largely depend on the fluvial flow of the River Clyde.

In the event of increased river flow in the future, a likely situation according to climate change scenarios, saltmarshes will deplete or disappear altogether, irrespective of the sediment influx into the estuary.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to test {{forecasting}} of the sediment transport process, taking into account two main uncertainties involved in sediment transport modeling. These are: the lack of knowledge regarding future flows, and the uncertainty with respect to which sediment transport formula should be chosen for simulations. The river reach chosen for study is the outlet part of the Ner River, located in {{the central part of}} Poland. The main characteristic of the river is the presence of an intensive <b>morphodynamic</b> <b>process,</b> increasing flooding frequency.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of {{laboratory}} experiments carried out in a large experimental apparatus aimed at reproducing a typical lagoonal environment subject to tidal forcings. The experimental apparatus consists of two adjoining basins reproducing {{the sea and the}} lagoon. The tide is generated at the sea by a vertical steel sharp-edge weir, oscillating vertically. The weir is driven by an ad hoc developed software which continuously corrects the weir motion on the basis of water levels measured at the sea, allowing us to generate a sinusoidal tide of fixed amplitude and period, oscillating around mean water level. The bottom of the lagoon is covered by a layer of cohesionless plastic grains, with a density of 1041 kg/m 3. The cohesionless plastic grains are characterized by a nearly uniform grain size distribution, with a median grain size of 0. 8 mm. The lack of external sediment supply, the absence of vegetation, and the prevalence of bedload transport prevent any deposition processes and lateral surface accretion, attributing a purely erosive character to the experimental lagoon. As a consequence, in this experimental lagoon the main <b>morphodynamic</b> <b>process</b> responsible for tidal network initiation and development is the differential erosion between the channels and the adjacent surface. The experiments were designed in order to analyze the effects of mean sea level variations on channel network dynamics, focusing on the changes of the relevant geomorphic characteristics of the experimental networks, such as e. g. drainage density, based on the probability distribution of unchanneled lengths, and flowing tidal prism. Our results suggest that a decrease in the tidal prism leads to network retreat and contraction of channel cross sections. Conversely, an increase in the tidal prism promotes network re-incision and re-expansion of channel cross sections. In general, contractions and expansions tend to occur within the same planar blueprint and the network re-expands cutting over the vestiges of old channels. However, in some cases, network re-extension through headward growth and initiation of new tributaries follows paths which do not overlap the old ones. A tendency to develop a linear relationship between tidal prism and drainage density is observed which suggests a cyclic response of network structure in terms of efficiency in draining the landscape. The described cyclicity in the contraction-expansion process should reasonably be interpreted as a statistical tendency rather than a pointwise equivalence. Our results show that changes in tidal prism rapidly influence network efficiency in draining the landscape and the related transport processes. This highlight the importance of these experiments for quantitative predictions of the long-term ecomorphological changes of the tidal landscape to relative mean sea level variations...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decades {{numerical}} models have become a powerful tool to investigate hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics. However, many key parameters and decisive numerical formulations of <b>morphodynamic</b> <b>processes</b> are bound to assumptions, estimations and uncertainties, which proceed to model results. The study aims to contribute to identify and take uncertainty of results in morphodynamic simulations into account. This is done by means of statistical analysis of key model parameters, and by {{the application of the}} ensemble forecasting method, based on Monte Carlo Simulations. The procedure is developed and applied to simulate the <b>morphodynamic</b> <b>processes</b> in the tidal flats of the Dithmarschen Bight, North Sea, Germany. Focus is placed on the migration of a tidal channel system, a physical process still poorly clarified, over observation periods of two years. Based on available data and extensive measurements of bathymetric evolution, water level, current, wave and sediment concentration, process-based models for flow, waves, sediment transport and morphodynamics are developed. Comparisons of bathymetric data with model results show that the model is capable to meet well the direction of the channel migration while the extent of migration is underestimated. Nevertheless, <b>morphodynamic</b> <b>processes</b> in tidal channels have been better resolved than those on tidal flats. Ranges of uncertainties are revealed. Analysis of model confidence showed that storm events have a significant relevance on morphodynamic results. Overall, the ensemble forecasting method proves to be a useful tool to account for uncertainties in morphodynamic modelling, to provide ranges of probability and, thus, increase the reliability of morphodynamic modelling results...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} results of {{laboratory}} experiments carried out in a large experimental apparatus aimed at reproducing a typical lagoonal environment subject to tidal forcings. The experiments were designed {{in order to improve}} our understanding of the main processes governing tidal network initiation and its progressive morphodynamic evolution. In particular, the experiments summarized herein aimed at understanding the physical processes, as well as boundary and initial conditions, which lead to the initiation and subsequent development of a tidal channel network, starting from a plane horizontal tidal flat located behind a barrier island and connected through the sea by a single inlet. During the experiments we observed the growth and development of tidal networks and analyzed their most relevant geomorphic features, taking into account the role played by the characteristics of the tidal forcing in driving the development of channelled patterns. The experimental evidence suggests that general network evolution is substantially characterized by three processes: (1) channel elongation via headward growth, driven by the exceedance of a critical bottom shear stress; (2) incision and sinuosity gradually increasing with channels age; (3) formation of new lateral creeks and tributaries. The lack of external sediment supply, the absence of vegetation, and the prevalence of bedload transport prevented any deposition processes and lateral surface accretion, attributing a purely erosive character to the experimental lagoon. Nevertheless, the morphodynamic feedbacks occurring in the erosional case are essentially the same that occur under depositional conditions. In fact, in both cases, channel excavation is closely connected to concentration of tidal fluxes within the channel network during maximum ebb phase when maximum velocities and shear stresses are reached. In this experimental lagoon the main <b>morphodynamic</b> <b>process</b> responsible for tidal network initiation and development is the differential erosion between the channels and the adjacent surface. The synthetic networks display geomorphic features which compare favourably with those of actual networks, thus emphasizing that our experimental framework is a useful tool for analyzing the processes governing the formation and evolution of tidal networks. In particular, the synthetic networks display width-to-depth ratios and seaward exponential widening and deepening in accordance with observational evidence. Furthermore they reproduce statistical network characteristics of geomorphic relevance, such as the exponential probability distribution of unchanneled path lengths. Finally, we analyze the effects of mean sea level variations on channel network dynamics, focusing on the changes of the relevant geomorphic characteristics of the experimental networks, such as e. g. probability distributions of unchanneled lengths and flowing tidal prisms...|$|E
40|$|Outburst floods {{are one of}} {{the most}} catastrophic natural hazards for populations and infrastructure. They are usually {{generated}} from storm runoff, rapid melting of glacial ice or man-made and natural dam breaks, such as river dikes, volcanic debris dams and landslide damns etc. Such high-magnitude sudden onset floods generally comprise of an advancing intense kinematic water wave that can induce considerable sediment transport. Therefore, the exploration and investigation of sediment-laden outburst floods cannot be limited solely to water flow but must also include the flood-induced sediment transport. Understanding the complex flow-bed interaction process in large (field) scale outburst floods is still limited, not least due to a lack of well-constrained field data, but also because consensus on appropriate modelling schemes has yet to be decided. In recent years, attention has focussed on the numerical models capable of describing the process of erosion, transport and deposition in such flows and they are now at a point at which they provide useful quantitative data. Although the "exact" measure of bed change is still unattainable the numerical models enhance and improve insights into large outburst flood events. In order to model and better understand heavily sediment-laden flows and resulting geomorphic impacts, this thesis adopts a layer-based conceptual model which separates the system into an active bed layer, a water sediment mixed sheet flow layer and a suspension layer. Correspondingly, a layer-based hydro-morphodynamic model is proposed fully considering both bedload and suspended load based on shallow water theory. The model system is primarily composed of a combination of three modules: (1) a hydrodynamic module; (2) a sediment transport module; and (3) a morphological evolution module. In the thesis, firstly, a robust hydrodynamic model is proposed and tested including addressing the source terms and wetting/drying issues for application to irregular beds. Then based on the robust hydrodynamic model, a layer-based morphodynamic model is developed and solved numerically by an advanced second-order Godunov-type finite volume method. A series of theoretical and experimental tests are applied to validate the model in terms of both hydrodynamic and morphodynamic aspects. The results of these tests show that the developed models can predict the hydrodynamic and <b>morphodynamic</b> <b>process</b> effectively with good agreement with theoretical and experimental results. To demonstrate a real application, a full-scale volcano-induced jökulhlaup or glacial outburst flood (GLOF) at Sólheimajökull, Iceland is reproduced by the proposed model. The simulation of the sediment-laden outburst flood is shown to perform well, with further insights into the flow-bed interaction obtained from the modelling output. These results are beneficial to flood risk management and hazard prevention and mitigation...|$|E
40|$|Mobile bed scaling (for scales {{smaller than}} 1 : 1) {{does not allow}} for ideal {{similarity}} between all nondimensional parameters. This leads to an exaggerated presence of one process over another or the development of scale effects. The complexity of the surf zone makes it especially difficult to separate and quantify the effect of sediment scaling on each individual process. As a result, the impact of sediment scaling on the holistic <b>morphodynamic</b> <b>process</b> is poorly understood. Profiles were obtained at TU Delft (scale 1 : 10) following the testing regime used during the SANDS project. This set made use of density and diameter scaled sediment (?s = 1200 kg/m 3 and d 50 = 0. 52 mm); scaled according to the bed load model of Henriquez, Reniers et al. (2008). The set used for analysis here includes the Hannover (prototype scale 1 : 1) and Deltares (Froude scale 1 : 6) profiles obtained during SANDS. The present work looks to extend what is currently known about the impact of sediment scaling on nearshore transport processes. Three main objectives are identified: 1) Showing profile development and inferred transport rates, compare nondimensional parameters across the nearshore and surf zone; 2) Identify how spatial variance of dominate hydrodynamic and sediment transport regimes across the surf zone are influenced by the subsequent scaling; 3) Explain morphological differences due to scaling by observing the small scale transport process. Analysis of the profiles showed a marked degree of geometrical similarity between all three facilities. More specifically, the development of a bar-trough system and subsequent offshore migration. The transport rates were, however, divergent. Compared to Hannover, the transport rates at Deltares were low where conversely TU Delft was high. Using ideal scaling theories as a basis, the cross shore distribution of the nondimensional parameters at TU Delft suggested that both sediment mobility and near bed suspension were similar with prototype. However, due to a large fall velocity, the Dean number was underestimated. From the use of Froude scaling at Deltares, the nondimensional parameters suggested that neither near bed nor suspended load transport regimes were reproduced correctly. This can mostly be attributed to the rippled bed state and reduced Shields value. A simple depth and time averaged model was also used to decompose the sediment concentrations. These concentrations were used to check consistency of the nondimensional parameter agreement with the manifestation of the physical process. Inconsistent with the nondimensional results, TU Delft showed that near bed sediment mobility and suspension was high. It is believed this led to the exaggerated sediment fluxes. Concentrations at Deltares suggest the rippled bed introduced a thinned boundary layer which caused decreased sediment mobility and the decreased sediment fluxes.

The results indicate that coastal currents could be used for the conversion of electric energy. Mean and maximum values of approximately 3 and 79 MW of electric power, respectively, could be obtained at specific points considering the wind driven circulation as the principal forcing mechanism. Considering a set of 6 turbines (20 m radius), an integrated annual rate of approximately 5 GWyear- 1 is estimated for the conversion of electric power. The presence of energy converters removes part of the kinetic energy from the coastal currents, generating divergence and convergence zones in accordance with the dominant direction of the currents. The major consequence for the natural ecosystem during the period simulated is the decrease of the intensity of currents and the increase of the suspended sediment concentration near the site of the converters...|$|R

In response to this proposition, the ministry started an investigation, but concluded there was no support for seaward development financed through residential housing. Consequently, the initial proposal was adjusted. A feasibility analysis was made for seaward extension together with extensive possibilities for nature and recreation. A follow-up investigation (2005) indicated a large need for nature and recreation in the conurbation of Western Holland. In 2006, commission Tielrooij urged {{the necessity of a}} combined approach of the Delfland coast for sustainable long-term flood protection with expanding spatial qualities. The commission recommended a research into innovative civil methods for sustainable flood protection and expanding spatial qualities, among which mega-nourishment is recommended. In April 2008, an agreement is signed, by all concerning governmental stakeholders, for coastal expansion according to the principle “Building with Nature”. This agreement enables the start of a process to examine and investigate the execution of a so-called “Zandmotor” (hereafter sand-engine) at the Delfland coast. Begin 2009, the Environmental Impact Assessment “pilot project sand-engine” was published, in autumn 2009 the decision was finished regarding the financial costs for the Province and the Department of Waterways and Public Works. In March 2011, the execution of the sand-engine started near the Delfland coast. EIA, based on long-term morphodynamic prediction The Environmental Impact Assessment for the pilot project the sand-engine is based on long-term morphodynamic predictions, made with a single numerical software model called Delft 3 D. This model calculated the morphological development of the sand-engine for 20 years in advance, using average hydrodynamic conditions. After the EIA and during the construction of the sand-engine new problems and questions arose among stakeholders concerning e. g. groundwater flow, swimming safety, impact storm events, aeolian transports, etc. These uncertainties were not modeled and simulated, and are not included in the EIA. Idealized model approach Because {{there was a lack of}} an integrated design approach during the EIA phase of the sand-engine, this thesis includes an idealized design approach for mega-nourishments. Due to this idealized design approach multiple physical processes can be integrated using several numerical models for accurate long-term modeling of mega-nourishments. One integration, in this idealized design approach, concerns the impact of storm events within long-term morphological predictions. The integration of storm events within long-term morphodynamic predictions, is made possible within this thesis, by coupling two numerical software models, Delft 3 D and XBeach. Delft 3 D functions as base core, generating long-term morphodynamic predictions, and via XBeach, storm events are simulated at several points in time. Impact storm events on long-term morphodynamics For the assessment of the impact of storm events on the morphological development of the sand-engine, a reference scenario is made for comparison. The reference case predicts the morphological development of the sand-engine with average hydrodynamics for five years in advance. Compared to the reference case, storm events substantially increase the <b>morphodynamic</b> <b>process</b> of the sand-engine. Multiple milt annual storm events (1 / 1 year) have more impact than a single severe storm event (1 / 100 year). During severe storm events (1 / 100 year and 1 / 1000 year) the pronounced hooked shape of the sand-engine remains intact.

We focus on exploring this interplay in modern soils and paleosols of southeast Sardinia (Italy), integrating two innovative techniques to a traditional pedological study: (i) laser ablation ICP-MS spot analyses applied to detect microscale distribution of trace elements in discrete soil features of organic-mineral (A) and argillic (Bt) horizons in thin section, and (ii) radioactive disequilibria as tracers and chronometers of pedogenetic alteration and geomorphic dynamics. The Pleistocene paleosols developed mainly during interglacial periods, with important clay illuviation and rubification. The other soils are essentially characterized by organic matter incorporation into the profiles. Field discontinuities described within soil profiles, related to phases of sediment aggradation and/or surface erosion, are often supported by laboratory results, mainly micromorphological and geochemical data. LA-ICP-MS data show an overall trend of increase of most trace elements (REEs included) from skeletal rock fragments to both clayey and organic-rich soil matrix to clay coatings. This pathway is clearly controlled by the degree of weathering of primary minerals and by pedogenetic processes, where element adsorption onto reactive sites of organic matter and clay particles and clay illuviation play prominent roles.

For the bio-geomorphological extension, relevant ecological processes are coupled with <b>morphodynamic</b> <b>processes</b> at various scales and are validated against the field data in Lake Veluwe. Capability {{of the model}} has been explored for applications of two salt marsh restoration cases in United States and the large scale morphodynamics of shoreface connected radial sand ridges located in South-east China Sea. Validations and applications show that this modelling platform is capable to be a multidiscipline research tool for morphologists and ecologists / biologists.

30|$|Postglacial {{sea-level rise}} flooded Saliña Tam. The boka is {{separated}} from the open sea by a bar of sand, coral rubble and beachrock reaching a width of up to 70 m and a height of up to 3 m above present sea level (a.s.l) (Figs. 2 and 3). When this bar formed and whether it formed due to long-term <b>morphodynamic</b> <b>processes</b> (e.g. longshore drift) (Zonneveld et al., 1977) or due to extreme wave events (Scheffers, 2005; Morton et al., 2008) is a subject of this paper. Today, salinity of the bokas is high (up to 120 ‰ below the halocline of Goto Meer during summer (Kobluk and Crawford, 1990)) and the water table is low due to low permeability of the seaward barrier, low precipitation most time of the year, {{as well as to}} high evaporation (De Buisonjé, 1974).|$|R
40|$|Coastal {{management}} increasingly {{relies on}} predictions made by numerical models of hydrodynamic and <b>morphodynamic</b> <b>processes.</b> For application of any computational model, a necessary and critical step {{is the model}} testing. This study involves the morphodynamical modelling of the Egmond site, the Netherlands. The general goal is evaluation of Delft 3 D model against the field data taken during the main campaign at the Egmond coast, {{within the framework of}} the COAST 3 D project. The morphodynamic model predictions obtained from depth-averaged (2 DH) and 3 -dimensional (3 D) modes are evaluated against the measurements. Comparisons between computed and measured morphological changes during the pre-storm period show good agreement. The deepening and widening of the rip channel can be predicted accurately. However, deviations in prediction of morphological changes during storm period are observed both in 2 DH and 3 D approaches...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{discusses}} {{the notion of}} a layer of sandy sediments overlying a substratum of cohesive deposits in the coastal zone. This layer of sand is generally more mobile and is therefore conventionally referred to as the dynamic layer. Its parameters are important to coastal lithodynamic and <b>morphodynamic</b> <b>processes</b> caused by waves and currents. On the other hand, the dynamic layer is formed by nearshore hydrodynamic impact. The variability of the features of the dynamic layer on the southern Baltic dune and cliff shores in Poland is analysed on the basis of selected geological data supported by local seismo-acoustic field investigations. It appears that the conventional notion of the dynamic layer makes sense only in specific geomorphologic conditions. In such cases, mostly related to cliff shores, theoretical modelling of sediment transport should take the properties of the dynamic layer into account...|$|R
40|$|A {{field data}} {{set of the}} {{artificial}} breaching of a coastal lagoon berm is presented, and includes {{a detailed analysis of}} the breach evolution in plan and elevation, together with water levels and flow velocities. A semi-coupled two-dimensional (depth averaged) numerical model describing both the shallow water hydrodynamics and morphodynamics is developed and tested against the field data. Key hydrodynamic and <b>morphodynamic</b> <b>processes</b> are discussed, and strategies to model these processes are presented and evaluated, such as accounting for modified roughness under transcritical flows and testing an improved algorithm for widening of the breach channel through side wall erosion. While further research is warranted, the processes relating to the erosion of the breach side walls and sediment transport under transcritical flow regimes were found to be essential to developing a realistic model of the overall breach process. A new channel bank erosion model is developed and implemented, which shows improved performance...|$|R
30|$|Due to {{the heavy}} metal content of the Rur River sediments (see Fig.  13, sample R 1) and {{dilution}} effects in the new Inde River, the Rur sediment samples (see Fig.  13, samples R 2 –R 4) do not show significant increases in lead and copper downstream of {{the mouth of the}} Inde River. Only the differences of the zinc concentrations of samples R 1 –R 4 let assume that the slight increase of zinc near the mouth is connected with the sediment input of the Inde River. The differences between the heavy metal concentrations of samples R 2 –R 4 (see Fig.  13) {{can be explained by the}} <b>morphodynamic</b> <b>processes</b> and complex flow conditions connected with sediment transport and sedimentation in the Rur River at the mouth of the Inde River as well as with the different grain size compositions of the samples.|$|R
