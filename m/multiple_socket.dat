25|$|Multisocket {{adaptors}} {{allow the}} connection {{of two or more}} plugs to a simple socket. They are manufactured in various configurations, depending on the country and the region in which they are used, with various ratings. In Europe for example, they are called double or triple adaptors, and transform a one socket into a <b>multiple</b> <b>socket.</b> This has the advantage of connecting more than one electrical consumer item to one single socket and is mainly used for low power devices (TV sets, table lamps, computers, etc.). They are usually rated at 6A 250V, 10A 250V, or 16A 250V, however this is the general rating of the adaptor (for example, if we have an adaptor for four sockets and it is marked 16A 250V, this means that the adaptor should not be loaded more than 16A, whether one, two, three or all sockets are used. Some people overload them, thus leading to accidents). In some countries these adaptors are banned and are not available in shops, as they may lead to fires due to overloading them. In the past, these adaptors were made from ceramic, Bakelite or other fire resistant plastics, but nowadays they are made from various available plastics that can be safely used in electrical devices (such as PA6, PVC, PP). Some low quality adaptors are made from plastics not approved for electrical use (such as PS or non fire resistant ABS), and these may cause fires in the case of overheating due to overloading or bad contacts.|$|E

Power strips are often used when many electrical devices are in proximity, such as for audio, video, computer systems, appliances, power tools, and lighting. Power strips often include a circuit breaker to interrupt the electric current in case of an overload or a short circuit. Some power strips provide protection against electrical power surges. Typical housing styles may include strip, rack-mount, under-monitor and direct plug-in.|$|E

In this paper we discuss an implementation of Zero Copy support for synchronous send() /recv() socket calls, that uses the remote DMA capability of InfiniBand for SDP data transfers. We added this support to the open-source implementation of SDP over InfiniBand. We evaluate this implementation over a 20 Gb/s InfiniBand link. We demonstrate scalability of Zero Copy and show its benefits for systems that utilize <b>multiple</b> <b>socket</b> connections in parallel. For example, enabling Zero Copy with 8 active connections yields a bandwidth growth from 630 MB/s to 1360 MB/s, at the same time reducing the CPU utilization by a factor of ten. 1...|$|E

Dalziel & Phillips (1948) used unipolar lumbar-anal electrodes on both guinea-pigs and chinchillas, Scott & Dziuk (1959) reported success with bipolar rectal electrodes on rats, mice and guinea-pigs. Hillemann, Gaynor & Dorsch (1963) described an electro-ejaculation method in chinchilla, but gave no details of the electrode or of the voltage used (Table 1).

The experiments indicated that relevancy evaluation was slower, when compared to evaluation of timeliness/popularity (Fig.  13). Word 2 Vec service in the Relevancy node (Fig.  4) read words of a tweet one line at a time from a single TCP socket.

In this context, optimal interpretation of PHM results means translating PHM information into maintenance policies and decisions that minimize life cycle costs, or maximize availability or some other utility function. The electronics PHM problem is characterized by imperfect and partial monitoring, and a random/overstress failure component {{must be considered in}} the decision process. Given that the forecasting ability of PHM is subject to uncertainties in the sensor data collected, the failure and damage accumulation models applied, the material dimensions and properties used in the models, the decision model in this paper addresses how PHM results can best be interpreted to provide value to the system maintainer. The result of this model is a methodology for determining an optimal safety margin and prognostic distance for various PHM approaches in single and <b>multiple</b> <b>socket</b> systems where the LRU’s in the various sockets that make up a system can incorporate different PHM approaches (or have no PHM structures at all). The discrete event simulation model described in this paper provides the information needed to construct a business case showing the application-specific usefulness for various PHM approaches including health monitoring (HM) and life consumption monitoring (LCM) for electronic systems. An example business case analysis for a single-socket system is provided. Index Terms- Prognostic health management (PHM), life cycle cost, cost modeling, discrete event simulation...|$|E

A pair of such wagons could carry a large treetrunk to a sawmill, but they required either the tree to take the full tension of the train or for a suitable number of match wagons to be marshalled between the two bolster wagons.

Our new broadcast algorithm for grid environments harnesses almost all downward and upward bandwidths of multi-lane NICs; A message to be broadcast is split into two pieces, which are broadcast along two independent binary trees in a pipelined fashion, and swapped between both trees. The salient feature of our algorithm is generality; it works effectively on both large clusters and grid environments. It can be also applied to nodes with a single NIC, by making <b>multiple</b> <b>sockets</b> share the NIC.

40|$|Compute nodes with <b>{{multiple}}</b> <b>sockets</b> each {{of which}} has multiple cores are starting to dominate in the area of scientific computing clusters. Performance inconsistencies from one execution to the next makes any performance debugging or tuning difficult. The resulting performance inconsistencies are bigger for memory-bound applications but still noticeable for all but the most compute-intensive applications. Memory and thread placement across sockets has significant impact on performance of these systems. We test overall performance and performance consistency for a number of OpenMP and pthread benchmarks including Stream, pChase, the NAS Parallel Benchmarks and SPEC OMP. The tests are run on a variety of multi-socket quad-core AMD Opteron systems. We examine the benefits of explicitly pinning each thread to a different core before any data initialization, thus improving and reducing the variability of performance due to data-to-thread co-location. Execution time variability falls to less than 2 % and for one memory-bound application peak performance increases over 40 %. For applications running on hundreds or thousands of nodes, reducing variability will improve load balance and total application performance.

40|$|To fuel an {{increasing}} need for parallel performance, system designers have resulted to using <b>multiple</b> <b>sockets</b> {{to provide more}} hardware parallelism. These multisocket systems have limited off-chip bandwidth due to their electrical interconnect which is both power and pin limited. Current systems often use of a Non-Uniform Memory Architecture (NUMA) {{to get the most}} system memory bandwidth from limited off-chip bandwidth. A NUMA system complicates the work of a performance programmer or operating system, because they must maintain data locality to maintain performance. Silicon photonics is an emerging technology that promises great off-chip bandwidth density and energy efficiency when compared to electrical signaling. With this abundance of bandwidth, {{it will be possible to}} build a relatively flat, high bandwidth memory interconnect. Because this interconnect has uniform bandwidth, NUMA optimizations will be unnecessary, which increases performance programmer productivity. If the penalties to making a multi-socket system are negated by the use of silicon photonics, there is less incentive to integrate, and economic incentives to disintegrate.
