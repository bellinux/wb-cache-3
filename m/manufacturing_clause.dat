25|$|A {{group of}} Tin Pan Alley music houses formed the Music Publishers Association of the United States on June 11, 1895, and unsuccessfully lobbied the federal {{government}} in favor of the Treloar Copyright Bill, which would have changed the term of copyright for published music from 24 to 40 years, renewable for an additional 20 instead of 14 years. The bill would also have included music among the subject matter covered by the <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>clause</b> of the International Copyright Act of 1891.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>clause</b> is {{a clause}} {{specifically}} stating that all {{copies of a}} work must be printed or otherwise produced domestically, even if the copyright was held by a foreigner. This was {{a feature of the}} International Copyright Act of 1891, covering books, maps, photographs, and lithographs. Its extension to all other media was proposed in the 1897 Treloar Copyright Bill, which failed in committee. The <b>manufacturing</b> <b>clause</b> did not expire until 1986, keeping the United States out of the Berne Convention until 1989.|$|E
50|$|The {{bill was}} {{extensively}} criticized in the press, especially for extending the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>clause,</b> and was strongly opposed by copyright leagues formed by authors and publishers. The bill {{was the subject}} of extensive lobbying efforts from both supporters and opponents. Although it didn't make it out of the Committee on Patents, some of its provisions did later pass.|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of opening causes in collective wage agreements allowing firms {{to deviate from}} their collective bargaining agreements has become widely accepted for the last fifteen years. With respect to the flexibility agreed through collective bargaining, the distinctions between single collective bargaining areas of the same industry have increased. Hence, the economic idea of uniform industry-wide central collective bargaining agreements is no longer tenable. The data set of the IAW used in this article provides differentiated information about opening clauses in collective wage agreements. By means of correspondence and cluster analysis, seven groups of collective bargaining areas are identified, which differ {{in the type of}} opening clauses introduced. Over the period from 1991 until 2004, the examination of dynamic aspects to these seven groups exhibits typical paths of development towards an improved flexibility agreed through collective bargaining. Furthermore, the conjunction of the data set with the German Structure of Earnings Survey of the years 1995 and 2001 makes it possible to show the relevance of the different types of single collective bargaining areas for employment and industries of the German <b>manufacturing</b> sector.

5000|$|Romanian Army — In November 2016, Romanian Prime Minister Dacian Cioloș {{announced}} {{a deal with}} Rheinmetall to build armored personnel carriers to replace the Soviet-era BTR-70-based TAB vehicles currently in service with the Romanian Armed Forces. The deal includes no direct reference to the Boxer vehicle, but does include a joint venture structure with a local <b>manufacturing</b> <b>clause,</b> meant to generate jobs in Romania. Although not confirmed, {{it is possible that}} the Boxer vehicle could form the basis of this new program.|$|E
5000|$|The bill {{incorporated}} {{two other}} pending bills (which were ultimately passed on their own) {{to create a}} Register of Copyrights (called a [...] "commissioner" [...] in the Treloar Bill), and to expand protections for public performance of copyrighted works, including music, for the first time. The bill would have also extended the term of copyright by 22 years, from 24 years and a 14-year extension (38 years) to 40 years and a 20-year extension (60 years). The law would have extended the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>clause</b> of the 1891 International Copyright Act to include most items excluded in 1891, including music, maps, etc.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Clause</b> {{required}} that all copies of foreign literary works should be printed from type {{set in the}} United States {{if they were to}} have American protection. This was an obvious concession to American printers, since they might otherwise have opposed the Act. When the International Copyright Act of 1891 was finally passed, foreign authors had to have their works in Washington, D.C. “on or before the day of publication in this or any foreign country.” This too would create a problem, but by the early 1900s British authors were granted American Copyright since it was published abroad thirty days from its deposit in Washington, D.C. This would then allow American publishers time to release an authorized edition.|$|E
