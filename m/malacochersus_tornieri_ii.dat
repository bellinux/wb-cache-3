50|$|<b>Malacochersus</b> <b>tornieri</b> is {{the only}} member of the genus Malacochersus.|$|R

5000|$|The pancake {{tortoise}} (<b>Malacochersus</b> <b>tornieri</b> [...] ) is {{a species of}} flat-shelled tortoise in the family Testudinidae. The species is native to Tanzania and Kenya. Its common name refers to the flat shape of its shell.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Large {{numbers of}} pancake {{tortoises}} (<b>Malacochersus</b> <b>tornieri)</b> and Horsfield tortoises (Testudo horsfieldii) in three consignments imported into Japan died soon after arrival. Some tortoises {{in the first}} con-signment were dead on arrival. Postmortem examination {{of two of the}} pancake tortoises and four of the Horsfield tortoises revealed necrotizing lesions of the oral mucosa in both species, primarily in the tongue. Eosinophilic to amphophilic inclusion bodies were visible in the nuclei of mucosal epithelial cells in the lesions. Similar inclusion bodies were observed in the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, stomach, lungs, kidneys, small and large intestines, pancreas, and cerebrum of the pancake tortoises and in the liver, spleen, and pancreas of the Horsfield tortoises. Electron microscopic examination of the cells containing inclusion bodies showed herpesvirus-like particles about 100 nm in diameter in the cytoplasm. Nested polymerase chain reaction analysis using a her-pesvirus consensus primer method confirmed the presence of a characteristic herpesvirus base sequence in tissue from these lesions.

40|$|The {{inner ear}} and brain endocast (Fig. 1) using micro CT scandata {{is part of}} a revised osteological {{analysis}} of the pancake tortoise <b>Malacochersus</b> <b>tornieri</b> (Mautner et al., 201 X). This tortoise has a very flat shell, which allows the animal to hide in cracks and under rocks in its natural habitat, i. e. rocky arid shrub and thorny brush environments in Tanzania and adjacent countries in eastern Africa (e. g., Procter, 1922) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Bacteria of {{the genus}} Helicobacter are {{associated}} with disease in humans and animals. Reports of infection in reptiles are very limited. In the present study, pathological findings and molecular characterization are reported for a Helicobacter species associated with septicemia in a pancake tortoise (<b>Malacochersus</b> <b>tornieri).</b> Disseminated infection resulted in regional cellulitis and edema {{of the head and}} neck, and pericarditis. Spiral bacteria were identified in cytological preparations and Warthin–Starry-stained sections of pathological lesions. Amplification of partial sequence of the 16 S ribosomal gene using polymerase chain reaction identified the organism as Helicobacter and suggest that it is a novel species...|$|R
40|$|Exceptional {{variability}} in the shell of the pancake tortoise <b>Malacochersus</b> <b>tornieri,</b> both in the keratinous surficial scutes and the underlying bones, {{in addition to its}} remarkably fenestrated bony shell are unique among tortoises. Based on 14 individuals of different sizes and ages, the observed variation in M. tornieri was described in detail, with additional notes on the typically testudinid skull, inner ear and brain endocast using microCT-scan data, as well as the limbs. Similar degrees of variation have not yet been described in any other extant turtle species and therefore seem notable in M. tornieri, and might be related to the species’ unique lifestyle. Within the carapace, the peripherals and suprapygals are most variable in number. Furthermore, different combinations of peripherals are participating in the central plastral fontanelle and in some individuals additional bones take part {{in the formation of the}} plastron...|$|R
40|$|In the USA and in Hungary, almost simultaneously, adenoviruses of a {{putative}} novel lineage {{were detected}} by PCR and sequencing in turtles belonging to four different species (including two subspecies) of the superfamily Testudinoidea. In the USA, partial {{sequence of the}} adenoviral DNA-dependent DNA polymerase was obtained from samples of a captive pancake tortoise (<b>Malacochersus</b> <b>tornieri),</b> four eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina) and two red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans). In Hungary, several individuals of the latter subspecies {{as well as some}} yellow-bellied sliders (T. s. scripta) were found to harbor identical, or closely related, putative new adenoviruses. From numerous attempts to amplify any other genomic fragment by PCR, only a nested method was successful, in which a 476 -bp fragment of the hexon gene could be obtained from several samples. In phylogeny reconstructions, based on either DNA polymerase or hexon partial sequences, the putative new adenoviruses formed a clade distinct from the five accepted genera of the family Adenoviridae. Three viral sub-clades corresponding to the three host genera (Malacochersus, Terrapene, Trachemys) were observed. Attempts to isolate the new adenoviruses on turtle heart (TH- 1) cells were unsuccessful. Targeted PCR screening of live and dead specimens revealed a prevalence of approximately 25...|$|R
5000|$|Between 1917 and 1923 she {{conducted}} research {{and wrote a}} series of scientific papers on the anatomy, classification and habits of reptiles and amphibians. Notable [...] amongst these is her study of an East African tortoise, now known as <b>Malacochersus</b> <b>tornieri,</b> which is able to conceal itself in rock crevices because of its flexible carapace. She corresponded widely, establishing her reputation with scientists around the world, and formally described many animals collected by others. In 1923, William Bateson sought her support for his critique of Paul Kammerer’s controversial work on the midwife toad (Alytes). Although Procter was [...] "not averse to war with Kammerer”, she believed there was insufficient material to assist Bateson on this issue. Much of her work at the museum entailed formally describing animals collected by others. She was elected as a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London(FLS), {{in recognition of the}} high quality of this taxonomic work. She also {{became a member of the}} Bombay Natural History Society. Joan Procter was also an accomplished draughtswoman and modeller. At the museum, she made models for display cases and combined her artistic flair with scientific accuracy in a series of paintings of amphibians and reptiles that were reproduced in colour as postcards.|$|R
40|$|Sixteen of the world's 42 {{species of}} land {{tortoises}} occur in Africa, 10 {{of which are}} endemic to southern Africa. South Africa itself, which occupies 0. 8 % of the earth's total land mass, has the highest tortoise biodiversity in the world, with 13 species. This is the first study to use molecular techniques to investigate the evolutionary history of this group, which displays an unusually high level of speciation on the continent. Four hundred and fifty base pairs of mtDNA cytochrome b sequence were obtained, using direct PCR-based sequencing, from 32 individual tortoise blood samples, comprising 13 different species from 6 genera. PAUP 3. 1. 1, and MEGA were used to infer a phylogeny using Chrysemys scripta elegans (an Emydid) an outgroup. Both phenetic and cladistic methods generated similar results. With the exception of Malacochersus, both morphological and molecular work show largely congruent results. When intra-specific relationships, using the molecular results, were compared to the existing morphological data, Psammobates was the only genus with a consistent topology. Proposals for the re-evaluation of Homopus, Kinixys and Geochelone have been made. Suggestions, based on molecular results, include the distinction between Chersobius and Homopus (Hewitt 1937), incorporating <b>Malacochersus</b> <b>tornieri</b> into Kinixys, and the elevation of Geochelone pardalis pardalis and G. p. babcocki to species level. Sequencing a further nine individuals within Homopus areolatus showed a higher than expected sequence variation, suggesting a distinct population structure and possibly cryptic species...|$|R
