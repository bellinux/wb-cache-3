50|$|Upon its {{scientific}} discovery, the Philippine eagle {{was first}} called the <b>monkey-eating</b> <b>eagle</b> because of reports from natives of Bonga, Samar, where the species was first discovered, that it preyed exclusively on monkeys; from these reports it gained its generic name, from the Greek pithecus (πίθηκος) ("ape or monkey") and phagus (-φάγος) ("eater of"). The species name commemorates Jeffery Whitehead, {{the father of}} John Whitehead. Later studies revealed, however, that the alleged <b>monkey-eating</b> <b>eagle</b> also ate other animals, such as colugos, civets, large snakes, monitor lizards, and even large birds, such as hornbills. This, coupled {{with the fact that}} the same name applied to the African crowned eagle and the Central and South American harpy eagle, resulted in a presidential proclamation to change its name to Philippine eagle in 1978, and in 1995 was declared a national emblem. This species has no recognized subspecies.|$|E

5000|$|Caves and the {{rainforest}} of Maitum are the natural habitat {{of a rare}} fruit bat species called giant golden-crowned flying fox (Acedoron jubatus), also known as [...] "silent planter," [...] since it contributes greatly to forest regeneration, because of eating lots of fruits and their seeds. The rare writhed-billed hornbill and Mindanao hornbill are {{also found in the}} surrounding rainforest. The Philippine eagle (a <b>monkey-eating</b> <b>eagle)</b> also thrives in the area.|$|E
50|$|The Philippine eagle {{was known}} {{initially}} as the Philippine <b>monkey-eating</b> <b>eagle</b> {{because it was}} believed to feed on monkeys (the only monkey native to the Philippines is the Philippine long-tailed macaque) almost exclusively; this {{has proven to be}} inaccurate. This may be because the first examined specimen was found to have undigested pieces of a monkey in its stomach. Like most predators, the Philippine eagle is an opportunist that takes prey based on its local level of abundance and ease. It is the apex predator in its range.|$|E

50|$|The Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi), {{also known}} as the <b>monkey-eating</b> <b>eagle</b> or great Philippine eagle, is an eagle of the family Accipitridae endemic to forests in the Philippines. It has brown and white-coloured plumage, and a shaggy crest, and {{generally}} measures 86 to 102 cm in length and weighs 4.7 to 8.0 kg. It is considered the largest of the extant eagles in {{the world in terms of}} length and wing surface, with the Steller's sea eagle and the harpy eagle being larger in terms of weight and bulk. Among the rarest and most powerful birds in the world, it has been declared the Philippine national bird. It is critically endangered, mainly due to massive loss of habitat resulting from deforestation in most of its range. Killing a Philippine eagle is punishable under Philippine law by 12 years in prison and heavy fines.|$|E
50|$|Off {{the coast}} of eastern Mindanao is the Philippine Trench, which descends {{to a depth of}} 10430 m. The Philippines is part of a western Pacific arc system {{characterized}} by active volcanoes. Among the most notable peaks are Mount Mayon near Legazpi City, Taal Volcano south of Manila, and Mount Apo in Mindanao. All of the Philippine islands are prone to earthquakes. The northern Luzon highlands, or Cordillera Central, rise to between 2500 m and 2750 m, and, together with the Sierra Madre in the northeastern portion of Luzon and the mountains of Mindanao, boast rain forests that provide refuge for numerous upland tribal groups. The rain forests also offer prime habitat for more than 500 species of birds, including the Philippine eagle (or <b>monkey-eating</b> <b>eagle),</b> some 1,100 species of orchids, and some 8,500 species of flowering plants.|$|E
50|$|They are {{threatened}} primarily by deforestation through logging and expanding agriculture. Old-growth forest is being lost {{at a high}} rate, {{and most of the}} forest in the lowlands is owned by logging companies. Mining, pollution, exposure to pesticides that affect breeding, and poaching are also major threats. Additionally, they are occasionally caught in traps laid by local people for deer. Though this is no longer a major problem, the eagle's numbers were also reduced by being captured for zoos. The diminishing numbers of the Philippine eagle were first brought to international attention in 1965 by the noted Filipino ornithologist Dioscoro S Rabor, {{and the director of the}} Parks and Wildlife Office, Jesus A Alvarez. Charles Lindbergh, best known for crossing the Atlantic alone and without stopping in 1927, was fascinated by this eagle. As a representative of the World Wildlife Fund, Lindbergh traveled to the Philippines several times between 1969 and 1972, where he helped persuade the government to protect the eagle. In 1969, the <b>Monkey-eating</b> <b>Eagle</b> Conservation Program was started to help preserve this species. In 1992, the first Philippine eagles were hatched in captivity through artificial insemination; however, not until 1999 was the first naturally bred eaglet hatched. The first captive-bred bird to be released in the wild, Kabayan, was released in 2004 on Mindanao; however, he was accidentally electrocuted in January 2005. Another eagle, Kagsabua, was released 6 March 2008, but was shot and eaten by a farmer. In June 2015 an eagle was released after being treated for a gunshot wound, two months later it was shot and killed. Killing this critically endangered species is punishable under Philippine law by twelve years in jail and heavy fines.Its numbers have slowly dwindled over the decades to the current population of 180 to 600 eagles. A series of floods and mud slides, caused by deforestation, further devastated the remaining population. The Philippine eagle may soon no longer be found in the wild, unless direct intervention is taken. The Philippine Eagle Foundation in Davao City, Philippines is one organization dedicated to the protection and conservation of the Philippine eagle and its forest habitat. The Philippine Eagle Foundation has successfully bred Philippine eagles in captivity for over a decade and conducted the first experimental release of a captive-bred eagle to the wild. The foundation has thirty-six eagles at its center, of which nineteen were bred in captivity, including one born in 2015; the first for two years.|$|E
50|$|The {{crowned eagle}} {{occupies}} a unique niche, {{as it is}} the only bird in which primates are the most commonly taken prey at the species level. While at least a dozen other accipitrids opportunistically hunt small or young monkeys, only the harpy eagle and, possibly, crested eagle of the neotropics have diets where primates may locally outnumber other prey. However, New World monkeys are generally smaller and less formidable than Old World monkeys. Also, both other eagles may prefer different prey where available: harpy eagles primarily take sloths, which can be as heavy as a colobus or mangabey but are much slower and less able to defend themselves, while crested eagles take a variety of tropical birds and arboreal mammals. Other large eagles have been confirmed to hunt adult Old World monkeys, including martial eagles, Verreaux's eagles, mountain hawk-eagles and Philippine eagles, whose generic scientific name and old common was even the <b>monkey-eating</b> <b>eagle,</b> but all are believed to rely on non-primate prey for the majority of their diet. The favored group in the crowned eagles diet is certainly the Cercopithecus genus. In Kibale National Park, Uganda, the red-tailed monkey (Cercopithecus ascanius) was the most represented prey species, making up 40% of the remains. Slightly larger monkeys, such as western red colobus (Piliocolobus badius), mantled guereza (Colobus guereza) and grey-cheeked mangabey (Lophocebus albigena) were secondary in the prior study and, altogether, primates made up 82.2% of the remains from two nests there. A total of 88% of the remains found around crowned eagle nests in the Ituri Rainforest in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were from primates: blue monkey (Cercopithecus mitis), red-tailed monkey, Wolf's mona monkey (C. wolfi), western red colobus and a mixture of mangabeys and black-and-white colobus. In 16 nests in the Ivory Coast's Taï Forest, more than 60% of remains around the eyries were monkeys and more than 45% of remains were from Cercopithecus monkeys. About half of the Cercopithecus remains were from Diana monkey (C. diana; 44 items from 28 adults and 16 immatures), with the other half from Campbell's mona monkey (C. campbelli) and lesser spot-nosed monkey (C. petaurista), which were indistinguishable as remains. Other represented monkeys in the Taï Forest included the Western red colobus, the olive colobus (Procolobus verus) and the king colobus (Colobus polykomos). The diet is, by necessity, more diverse in Kiwengwa/Pongwe Forest Reserve in the Matumbi Hills of Tanzania but the blue monkey was still the most represented prey species, making up 20% of the remains. In one nest in the prior study, the Blue monkey made up more than 90% of the remains. Where they overlap in range, the vervet monkey can be quite prominent as prey for crowned eagles, as their relatively small size, diurnal and terrestrial habits may make them more vulnerable.|$|E
