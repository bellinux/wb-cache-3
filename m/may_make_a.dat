5|$|After the rut, females form large {{herds of}} up to 50 individuals. Newborn calves are kept close {{by a series of}} vocalizations; larger {{nurseries}} have an ongoing and constant chatter during the daytime hours. When approached by predators, the largest and most robust females <b>may</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> stand, using their front legs to kick at their attackers. Guttural grunts and posturing effectively deter all but the most determined predators.|$|E
5|$|In addition, if civil {{proceedings}} are taken against the Government, section 27 of the Government Proceedings Act bars the High Court from granting injunctions against it. In place of an injunction, the Court <b>may</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> declaration concerning the parties' rights. The Court also {{may not make}} an injunction against a government officer if the effect of doing so would be to provide relief {{that could not be}} obtained against the Government directly. Section 2(2) of the Act makes it clear that the term {{civil proceedings}} includes proceedings for judicial review.|$|E
5|$|The Government Proceedings Act bars the High Court from {{granting}} injunctions {{against the}} Government {{or one of}} its officers. An injunction is an equitable private law remedy that restrains a public authority from doing an act that is wrongful or ultra vires. In place of an injunction, the Court <b>may</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> declaration concerning the parties' rights. At common law, there is no general right to claim damages – that is, monetary compensation – if rules of public law have been breached by an authority. In order to obtain damages, an aggrieved person {{must be able to}} establish a private law claim in contract or tort law.|$|E

5|$|Small prey {{is usually}} torn into chunks and eaten {{completely}} including bones and fur, while prey {{larger than about}} 100g (4oz), such as baby rabbits, Cryptomys blesmols, or Otomys vlei rats, is usually dismembered and the inedible parts discarded. Contrary to what is sometimes assumed, the barn owl does not eat domestic animals on any sort of regular basis. Regionally, non-rodent foods are used as per availability. On bird-rich islands, a barn owl might include some fifteen to twenty percent of birds in its diet, while in grassland it will gorge itself on swarming termites, or on Orthoptera such as Copiphorinae katydids, Jerusalem crickets (Stenopelmatidae) or true crickets (Gryllidae). Bats and even frogs, lizards and snakes <b>may</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> minor but {{significant contribution to the}} diet; small Soricomorpha like Suncus shrews may be a secondary prey of major importance.|$|E

25|$|In most civil trials, the {{plaintiff}} begins the proceedings {{by making a}} speech opening his or her case.

If he or she elects not to do so, the plaintiff <b>may</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> speech closing his or her case, and the defendant then proceeds to state his or her case. However, if the defendant elects to adduce evidence, he or she proceeds to open his or her case, present the evidence on his or her behalf, and make a speech closing the case. The plaintiff may then make a speech in reply. If any party in his or her final speech raises a fresh point of law or cites any authority not previously cited, the other party <b>may</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> further speech in reply to that point of law or authority.|$|E

25|$|The c-examples {{are cases}} of {{preposition}} stranding, which {{is possible in}} English, but not allowed in many languages {{that are related to}} English.

Prescriptive grammars often claim that preposition stranding should be avoided in English as well; however, in certain contexts pied-piping of prepositions in English <b>may</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> sentence feel artificial or stilted.|$|E
