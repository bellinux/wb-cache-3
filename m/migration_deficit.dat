In 1980 it was censused at 61,901, and has been declining since. Since about 2000, the county's population declines by about 100-300 persons annually, mainly due to a <b>migration</b> <b>deficit</b> of about 300 persons annually.

40|$|In vertebrates, interneurons of the {{olfactory}} bulb (OB) are generated postnatally and throughout {{life at the}} subventricular zone of the forebrain. The neuronal precursors migrate tangentially through the forebrain using a well defined pathway, the rostral migratory stream (RMS), and a particular mode of migration in a chain-like organization. A severe size reduction of the OB represents the most striking morphological phenotype in neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) -deficient mice. This defect has been traced back to a <b>migration</b> <b>deficit</b> of the precursors in the RMS and linked {{to the lack of}} the polysialylated form of NCAM. In this study we investigate the morphological alterations and functional properties of the RMS in mice totally devoid of all isoforms of NCAM and polysialic acid (PSA).

We show that microRNA- 9 (miR- 9) is abundantly expressed in control neural progenitor cells (NPCs) but also significantly downregulated in a subset of SZ NPCs. We observed {{a strong correlation between}} miR- 9 expression and miR- 9 regulatory activity in NPCs as well as between miR- 9 levels/activity, neural migration, and diagnosis. Overexpression of miR- 9 was sufficient to ameliorate a previously reported neural <b>migration</b> <b>deficit</b> in SZ NPCs, whereas knockdown partially phenocopied aberrant migration in control NPCs. Unexpectedly, proteomic- and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) -based analysis revealed that these effects were mediated primarily by small changes in expression of indirect miR- 9 targets rather than large changes in direct miR- 9 targets; these indirect targets are enriched for migration-associated genes. Together, these data indicate that aberrant levels and activity of miR- 9 {{may be one of the}} many factors that contribute to SZ risk, at least in a subset of patients...|$|E

Against this background, the contribution analyses {{the relationship between}} regional migration and regional growth. From a theoretical point of view, one might find reasons in favour and in opposition to a convergence supporting function of migration. If migrants are taken from the upper tail of the human capital distribution of a poor region, divergence is the probable outcome. If {{on the other hand}} people with low human capital endowment move to richer regions, migration might enhance regional convergence. The empirical analysis how regional migration and convergence are interrelated is performed on the basis of German districts within a period from 1995 to 2006. The concept of ß-convergence is applied and a cross-section model controlling for spatial correlation between the error terms is estimated. The results indicate convergence on the regional level; East German regions seem to catch up particularly fast. The effect of migration is twofold. Out-migration from poor region is correlated with strong growth in these regions. However, the corresponding migration towards richer region is accompanied with growth in these regions, too. Therefore, the impact of migration on convergence is uncertain. Nevertheless, the outcome is in favour of an aggregate benefit of migration if people move from poor to rich regions. ...|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Down {{syndrome}} (DS) is {{the result}} of trisomy of human chromosome 21 (Hsa 21) and occurs in approximately 1 / 700 live births. Mouse models of DS have been crucial in understanding the gene-phenotype relationships that underlie many DS anomalies. The Ts 65 Dn mouse model, trisomic for half of the Hsa 21 orthologs replicates many DS phenotypes including craniofacial alterations such as a small, dysmorphic mandible, midface, and maxilla. Other mouse models, such as the Ts 1 Rhr which contains a triplication of 33 Hsa 21 orthologs, have been used to better understand the genes responsible for craniofacial alterations. Our laboratory has demonstrated that the postnatal mandibular phenotype found in Ts 65 Dn mice {{can be traced back to}} an original neural crest cell (NCc) deficit in the developing first pharyngeal arch (PA 1) at embryonic day 9. 5 (E 9. 5). Furthermore, evidence suggested that both a proliferation deficit in the PA 1 and a <b>migration</b> <b>deficit</b> in the NCC from the neural tube (NT) could be the mechanism behind this deficit. However, the molecular mechanisms behind these deficits remain to be elucidated. Due to the involvement of the Hsa 21 genes DYRK 1 A and RCAN 1 in regulation of signaling pathways including NFATc (NFAT 2), a transcription factor known to influence cellular proliferation and, later, bone development, we hypothesized that dysregulation of these genes could underlie the cellular deficit in the PA 1. Furthermore, we hypothesized that targeting Dyrk 1 a by decreasing activity or available protein could ameliorate the established deficits. 	Through the use of RNA isolation techniques and cell culture systems of cell from the PA 1 and NT of E 9. 5 Ts 65 Dn, Ts 1 Rhr, and control embryos, we established that trisomic genes Dyrk 1 a and Rcan 1 ara dysregulated in both structures and that these two genes may interact. Furthermore, we established that a proliferation deficit in the Ts 65 Dn PA 1 and a <b>migration</b> <b>deficit</b> in the Ts 65 Dn PA 1 and NT exists at E 9. 5 and can be rescued to euploid levels in vitro with the addition of the Dyrk 1 a inhibitor, EGCG, a green tea polyphenol. We also confirmed that harmine, a more highly studied and specific Dyrk 1 a inhibitor, is capable of similar effects on proliferation of PA 1 cell from E 9. 5 Ts 65 Dn embryos. Furthermore, when Ts 65 Dn pregnant mothers were treated with EGCG in vivo, the cellular deficit found in the developing E 9. 5 embryonic PA 1 was rescued to near euploid volume and NCC number. Treatment with EGCG did not adversely impact litter size or embryonic development. Interestingly, euploid embryonic volume increased with EGCG treatment. Expression analysis of the E 9. 5 PA 1 of EGCG treated Ts 65 Dn and control embryos revealed dysregulation of several genes involved in craniofacial and developmental pathways including Dyrk 1 a, Rcan 1, Ets 2 and members of the sonic hedgehog pathways. Our novel results provide a foundation for better understanding the molecular mechanisms of craniofacial development and may provide evidence-based therapeutic options to improve the quality of life for individuals with DS...|$|E

Several reports indicate that mutations in NSMF are related to Kallmann syndrome (KS), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) associated with anosmia or hyposmia. It has also been reported that a protein knockdown results in <b>migration</b> <b>deficits</b> of Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) positive neurons from the olfactory bulb to the hypothalamus during early neuronal development. Here we show that mice that are constitutively deficient for the Nsmf gene do not present phenotypic characteristics related to KS. Instead, these mice exhibit hippocampal dysplasia with a reduced number of synapses and simplification of dendrites, reduced hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA 1 synapses and deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) activation of CREB-activated gene expression plays a documented role in hippocampal CA 1 synapse and dendrite formation. We found that BDNF induces the nuclear translocation of Jacob in an NMDAR-dependent manner in early development, which results in increased phosphorylation of CREB and enhanced CREB-dependent Bdnf gene transcription. Nsmf knockout (ko) mice show reduced hippocampal Bdnf mRNA and protein levels as well as reduced pCREB levels during dendritogenesis. Moreover, BDNF application can rescue the morphological deficits in hippocampal pyramidal neurons devoid of Jacob. Taken together, the {{data suggest that the}} absence of Jacob in early development interrupts a positive feedback loop between BDNF signaling, subsequent nuclear import of Jacob, activation of CREB and enhanced Bdnf gene transcription, ultimately leading to hippocampal dysplasia...|$|R
40|$|Neuronal {{lamination}} is {{a characteristic}} cytoarchitectonic {{feature of the}} neocortex and there exists a complex circuitry of connections among neurons found within and between cortical lamina. Interhemispheric cortical connections also exist, made by neurons found in several lamina with axons forming the corpus callosum. An ongoing challenge in understanding normal cortical function, as well as cortical dysfunction due to disease or injury, is the revelation of molecules that regulate lamination in the developing cortex as well as description {{of the rules of}} connectivity among neocortical neurons. ^ The present report details our evaluation of intraventricular injection and in utero electroporation as a tool for labeling newly-generated rat cortical neurons. Electroporation of fluorescent proteins targeting early-born neurons reliably resulted in the labeling of neurons found in deep neocortical lamina. The cellular compartments which could be visualized included dendrites and spines, somata, axons and collaterals, and often axon terminals. Electroporation of fluorescent proteins targeting late-born neurons reliably resulted in the labeling of neurons found in upper neocortical lamina. Interestingly, glia including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and putative microglia were also labeled. Experiments performed in mice revealed similar results. Using this technique, as well as sequential electroporation which targeted both early and late-born neurons, it was possible to describe the pattern of intracortical and callosal connections made by neurons found in different lamina. ^ Combining electroporation and RNAi targeting Doublecortin (Dcx), it was possible to determine how this molecule regulates neocortical lamination and the development of cortical connections. RNAi of Dcx resulted in disruption in neuronal migration with neurons found in inappropriate lamina as well as trapped in the white matter forming a subcortical band heterotopia. Interestingly, similar experiments in mice also resulted in migration disruption, however, heterotopia were not observed. Intracortical and callosal connections were examined in brains with <b>migration</b> <b>deficits</b> due to Dcx RNAi, which revealed only minor changes in the pattern of callosal connections. ^ Results from the present experiments highlight the use of electroporation and RNAi as tools for visualization and molecular perturbation of neurons in the developing neocortex.

Due {{to the high}} phenotypic heterogeneity in ASDs, both the identification of causative factors {{and the development of}} successful therapeutic interventions has been challenging. Thus, understanding convergent pathophysiological mechanisms by which defined etiologies result in ASDs can serve as an invaluable starting point towards the development of successful therapeutic treatments. Here, I investigate how alterations in CNTNAP 2, an autism-susceptibility gene, can lead to ASD-related deficits in neuronal function. Recessive truncating mutations in CNTNAP 2 cause Cortical Dysplasia Focal Epilepsy (CDFE), a syndromic form of ASD in humans. Remarkably, Cntnap 2 knock-out (KO) mice, which have been genetically engineered to lack Cntnap 2 expression, recapitulate the core behavioral deficits of the disorder, including impairments in social interactions and communication, repetitive and restrictive behaviors, seizures, decreased neuronal synchrony, and neuronal <b>migration</b> <b>deficits.</b> Here, I take advantage of this invaluable research tool to dissect the synaptic, cellular, and neuronal microcircuit activity changes associated with loss of Cntnap 2 in the KO mouse. I use electrophysiology and histological studies to assess these alterations within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), an area associated with social behavior. I observe that although there are no significant alterations in the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons or parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the KO, excitatory cells show a significant decrease in both excitatory and inhibitory inputs. These changes are accompanied by a decrease in dendritic spine density, and suggest a reduction in the total number of functional synapses within mPFC. These in vitro findings are concurrent with a notable reduction in local field potential (LFP) power in vivo, and likely reflect an overall decrease in excitatory drive, likely to be underlie some of the behavioral deficits observed in the mouse. Finally, I describe the collaborative development of a novel social interaction task {{that can be used to}} assess changes in neuronal activity in vivo, both at baseline, in a social behavioral context, and in response to potential pharmacological interventions. The findings delineated here serve as a roadmap for neurophysiological characterization of a rodent model of ASD, and provide initial mechanistic insights into how loss of Cntnap 2 alters mPFC microcircuitry. This work therefore serves as a starting point to finding convergent molecular, biological and physiological pathways that can contribute to our understanding and treatment of the ever so complex ASDs...|$|R

40|$|To broaden our {{knowledge}} {{about the role of}} cGKI a in the nervous system, especially in sensory neuron axonal growth, this thesis focussed on the following issues: a) Using an isoform specific antibody the expression of cGKI a was investigated in wholemounts, brain sections, and western blots during embryonic and early postnatal development of the mouse nervous system. The observed spatiotemporal expression pattern of cGKI a suggests a functional role for the kinase in regulating axonal growth, migration, and differentiation of several neuronal populations. b) Cells known to express cGKI a in the wildtype were analysed for potential pathfinding errors or <b>migration</b> <b>deficits</b> in mice deficient for cGKI. For this purpose immunohistochemical studies employing several antibodies and Silver/Nissl-Stainings were carried out. However, none of the structures examined varied from those of wildtype littermates with respect to pathfinding errors or other malformations. c) cGMP-activated cGKI phosphorylates several intracellular target proteins. Three of those proteins (VASP, CRP 2 and myosin phosphatase/myosin IIB) were chosen for further investigations due to their ability to regulate cytoskelatal dynamics. Phosphorylation studies using isolated dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) from cGKI-deficient and wildtyp mice allowed the clear identification of VASP as a phosphorylation target of cGKI in sensory neurons. Furthermore, using a panel of antibodies several developmental stages of the corresponding knockout mice were immunohistochemically tested for pathfinding errors with respect to those found in the cGKI-knockout mouse. However, in none of these knockout mice pathfinding of DRG axons was disturbed, suggesting that - disregard of potential compensatory effects - none of these proteins is involved in the pathfinding errors, detected in cGKI deficient mice. d) Assuming that none of the cGKI targets investigated so far is essential for pathfinding of sensory axons, it was necessary to pursuit alternative approaches to identify potential targets and binding partners of cGKI or cGKI a in the nervous system, possibly playing a role in DRGs too. In an approach to find potential substrates of cGKI, tissue lysates from cGKI deficient or wildtype cerebellum after stimulation by the cGKI activator 8 -pCPT-cGMP were separated by two-dimensional gelelectrophoresis and compared for differences in the pattern of protein expression or phosphorylation, respectively. Comparative studies of changes in protein expression {{due to the lack of}} cGKI revealed both downregulated and upregulated proteins, which were identified by mass spectrometry. Although some differences in the phosphorylaton pattern of wildtype and cGKI-deficient mice were observed also, identification of those proteins requires further investigations due to methodological problems. In a second approach the yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen an E 17 mouse library for intracellular interaction partners of cGKI a. Two potential interaction partners for cGKI a have been found: the DNA-methyltransferase 3 a (Dnmt 3 a) and the hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase 2 b 1 b (Sult 2 b 1 b).

The report lays {{out a series}} of policy responses to spatial unevenness that are intended to mobilize the growth-enhancing advantages of unbalanced development while ensuring inclusive development. However, the report mobilizes a narrow view of economic development that is disconnected from place, politics, and society. In geography, which lends its name to the report, economies are theorized as embedded-as produced in and through space, rather than merely on it. Geography and spatial patterns are constitutive coproducers of political-economic processes, not just outcomes. I elaborate how a critical geographic understanding of an "everywhere embedded economy" (Peck 2005) highlights the inseparability of economic processes from the social, political, historical, and geographic contexts which give them meaning. I connect the idea of embedded economy to a consideration of centrality of care to a humane and inclusive development. I argue that the report's emphasis on labor mobility as a key mechanism for enhancing development ignores the global division of care work that is itself built on the invisibility and undervaluation of care in mainstream versions of economic development. I conclude that "thinning borders" will not resolve questions of inequality but rather will allow those who are more powerful to exploit the resultant power differentials expressed in <b>migration</b> and care <b>deficits</b> across the globe.

40|$|IntroductionIt's in {{the wake}} of Brigitte Schurch's work that the {{indication}} of Botulinum Toxin (BoNT) developed in the treatment of Detrusor Hyperactivity (DH). DH treatment by BoNT injection is considered to be well tolerated. However, in two patients treated with intradetrusor BoNT injections, a motor deficit located at the root of lower limbs was noticed. That observation raises questions about its diffusion beyond the injection site. ObservationsThey are two women with Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS) receiving BoNT as a treatment for DH. On several occasions in post injection, an aggravation of the proximal motor deficit on the hip flexors was observed, which justified the realization of a SOLUMEDROL bolus in the event of relapses. DiscussionRamirez-Castaneda et al. [1] describe three means of dissemination of the BoNT: migration by systemic or neuronal transport, propagation and diffusion. Migration by systemic transport: it has been established by electromyography (EMG) analysis. These subclinical manifestations are not correlated by EMG [2]. This mechanism can’t account for an isolated motor <b>deficit.</b> <b>Migration</b> by axonal transportAnimal experiments confirm the axonal transport of BoNT. On human subjects, Marchand-Pauvert et al. suggest its existence: reduction of the reciprocal inhibition exercised by Renshaw cells after BoNT injections [3]. Local dissemination of BoNT by diffusion and propagationIn the absence of direct connection between the iliopsoas and the bladder, this hypothesis looks compromised. SynthesisA retrograde migration of BoNT via hypogastric nerves seems to prevail. It could be followed by axonal anterograde transport causing a deficit on the hip flexors via the L 2 nerve root...|$|R
40|$|Migration—environment {{linkages}} are at {{the centre}} of media attention because of public concern about climate change and a perceived "flooding" of migrants from less developed countries into more affluent parts of the world. In the past few years, a substantial body of conceptual literature about environmentally induced migration has evolved, {{but there is still}} a paucity of empirical work in this area. Moreover, the environmental causes of migration have been studied largely in isolation of the environmental consequences. In this paper we present an analysis of migration and vegetation dynamics for one country (Ghana) to assess four migration—environment linkages. On the one hand, we look at two environmental drivers of migration: environmental push and pull. On the other hand, we look at the environmental impact of migration on source and destination areas. Census data at the district level (N= 110) are used to map domestic migration flows in Ghana, which are then related to vegetation dynamics retrieved from a remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset (1981 — 2006). The analysis shows that at the national level, there are significant but weak correlations between migration and vegetation cover and trends therein. Districts with a <b>migration</b> <b>deficit</b> (more out-migration than in-migration) tend to be more sparsely vegetated and have experienced a more positive NDVI trend over the past quarter century than districts with a migration surplus. A disaggregation of data in three principle migration systems shows stronger correlations. Namely that north—south migration and cocoa frontier settlement have important environmental dimensions, but environmental factors do not seem {{to play a major role}} in migration to the capital, Accra. An important insight from this paper is that migration flows in Ghana can be explained partly by vegetation dynamics but are also strongly related to rural population densities. This is because access to natural resources is often more important than the scarcity or abundance of natural resources per se. This study further shows that satellite remote sensing can provide valuable input to analyses of migration—environment linkages...|$|E
40|$|Pretzel Syndrome (also Polyhydramnios, Megalencephaly, and Symptomatic Epilepsy syndrome; PMSE) is a {{recently}} described rare neurodevelopmental disorder {{occurring in the}} Old Order Mennonite pediatric population, and characterized by intractable infantile-onset epilepsy, neurocognitive delay, craniofacial dysmorphism, and histopathological evidence of heterotopic neurons in subcortical white matter, suggestive of failed neuronal migration. PMSE {{is caused by a}} homozygous deletion of exons 9 - 13 of LYK 5 /STRADA, which encodes the pseudokinase STRADA, an upstream inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Therefore, we hypothesize that STRADA plays a critical role in neuronal migration through modulating mTOR (specifically mTOR complex 1, mTORC 1) signaling, and that therapeutic mTORC 1 inhibition can ameliorate features of the PMSE disease phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we model PMSE in vitro using stable shRNA knockdown of STRADA (STRADA KD) in mouse neural progenitor cells (mNPCs). In vivo, we use in utero electroporation to create focal STRADA KD in the developing mouse brain. We show that STRADA depletion disrupts pathfinding and polarization in migrating mNPCs in vitro, and this effect can be rescued by inhibition of mTORC 1 with rapamycin or of its downstream effector p 70 S 6 kinase (p 70 S 6 K) with PF- 4708671 (p 70 S 6 Ki), indicating an mTORC 1 -specific dependence. We then define a pathway for this effect downstream of mTORC 1, through insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS 1) signaling to cofilin, and finally modulating actin dynamics. In vivo, we demonstrate that STRADA KD causes a cortical lamination defect in the mouse, which can be rescued with rapamycin treatment, confirming the dependence of STRADA 2 ̆ 7 s effect on mTORC 1 signaling and suggesting an important target for patient therapy. To correlate our mouse model with PMSE, we demonstrate congruent mTORC 1 and downstream signaling and rescue of <b>migration</b> <b>deficit</b> with rapamycin and p 70 S 6 Ki in PMSE patient fibroblasts. Finally, we report reduction of seizure frequency with rapamycin treatment in previously intractable PMSE patients. Our findings define a novel role for STRADA in neuronal migration, demonstrate a mechanistic link between STRADA loss and mTORC 1 hyperactivity in PMSE, and suggest that mTORC 1 inhibition can serve as an effective therapeutic bio-target in PMSE as well as other devastating mTOR-associated neurodevelopmental disorders. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{bioactive}} phospholipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) has {{an impact}} on cell-proliferation, apoptosis, cell-migration and development in the central nervous system, often via increases in intracellular calcium [Ca 2 +] i levels. The majority of the described LPA actions are g-protein mediated and both, receptors and signaling pathways are present in the brain. Thus, LPA mediated actions in the brain came into focus. In this thesis the patch-clamp technique was utilized to investigate neuromodulatory actions of LPA in mouse neurons. During brain development LPA actions are described. A family of LPA degrading enzymes the lipidphosphate phosphatases (LPPs) are present early in development. Reduced levels of LPP 1 / 1 a via shRNA in the embryonic brain resulted in a slowed migration of neocortical neurons. Neurons with changed LPP 1 / 1 a levels were electrophysiological profiled, because the maturation of ionic currents is tightly coupled to the migration of neurons. Neurons reaching their target at embryonic day 18 independent of their LPP 1 / 1 a levels did not differ. However, neurons that migrated slower due to shRNA expression did not generate regenerative potentials. A probable underlying cause was the same ratio of inward and outward rectifying conductances in contrast to a higher inward ratio in controls. On postnatal day 5 these neurons were mostly in layer 5 and no longer electrophysiologically different. In conclusion, the <b>migration</b> <b>deficit</b> lead to a delayed current development and an electrophysiological re-organisation of affected neurons in the neocortex. CA 1 hippocampal neurons in accute brain slices responded to LPA. When LPA was applied extracellularly miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) increased in frequency. However, the inhibtory miniature postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were unchanged. The mEPSC increase was mediated by LPA 2 -receptors as there was no increase in LPA 2 -receptor knock-out mice. Further investigations were carried out in primary cultured hippocampal neurons to pin-point the LPA localisation. Contrary to accute slices the in vitro model responded with a reduction of mEPSCs. Neither mIPSCs of wildtype nor mEPSCs of LPA 2 knock-out neurons were changed. The most probable modulation by calcium was further investigated. Buffering postsynaptic [Ca 2 +] i and applying LPA reduced mEPSCs whereas no reduction was observed after omitting extracellular Ca 2 +. These contrary results between accute slices and cultured neurons point to an involvement of glial factors and/ or artifacts as a result of culturing. Furthermore, the hyperpolarisation activated cyclic nucleotide gated current I h can be modulated by g-protein signaling cascades. Activation of these, therefore, could lead to I h modulation. A putative modulation was investigated in CA 1 neurons, but somatic whole-cell recordings revealed no change of I h. These results show that LPA-receptor activation is either not specific or a modification of I h cannot be measured. Taken together these data show that lysophosphatidic acid has transient and long lasting physiological implications in neurons. Furthermore, the conducted experiments might be the starting point for future studies...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} study {{explores the}} museum as site and resource for language learning by adult migrants, refugees and asylum seekers. English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) provision has emerged {{over the past}} decade in museums across the UK and elsewhere within an increasing emphasis on informal adult learning programs. While there has been extensive research on second language acquisition, museum learning and social inclusion separately, there have been few studies that have investigated language learning in the context of museums, and even fewer studies that have sought to understand the benefits of language learning in museums for this target group of learners and how it might relate to the concept of inclusion. The study is centred around an ethnography that addresses these gaps in the literature and which examined three primary questions: (a) what are the target learners’ experiences of social inclusion and exclusion post-migration, and its interface with their English language abilities? (b) what are learners’ perceptions of the impact of participating in ESOL in museums in terms of exclusion and inclusion?, and (c) what occurs in interaction during ESOL in museums? In collaboration with City of Edinburgh Council Museums and Galleries Service, a cohort of 14 adult ESOL learners were studied over a 5 -month ESOL course held in the City’s Museums and Galleries. In-depth time-series interviews were conducted with participants over the 5 -month period. Narrative analysis (Labov & Waletzky, 1967; Riessman, 1993) of interviews examined narrative trajectories within case and across cases, mapping experiences post migration, in and beyond museums. In order to investigate the affordances of dialogue in museums, conversational interaction was observed and recorded during the 11 weekly museum visits. Conversation analysis (Leinhardt & Knutson, 2004; Markee, 2000) examined what occurred in talk, focusing on interaction between interlocutors, its function and content. Drawing on a social theory that conceptualizes language as symbolic power (Bourdieu, 1977, 1989, 1991) and identities as constructed and reflexive (Block, 2007 b; Giddens, 1991; Norton, 2000), analysis indicates that the experience of <b>migration</b> provoked <b>deficit</b> conceptions of self as participants negotiated their new social milieu through English language. Access to opportunities to engage in English are mediated both by institutional forces, e. g. social space afforded in institutional contexts, and perceptions of self. Analysis of dialogue in museums shows participants positioning themselves and being positioned as ‘knowers’, where primacy was given to collaborative meaning making about museum displays, objects and artefacts in conversational interaction. Analyses of interviews indicate shifts in identity trajectories from deficit to competent views of self through participation in ESOL in museums. These findings suggest a cumulative effect of micro-interactions on identities constructed in dialogue and point to the critical role which learning in museums and other informal environments can have in terms of providing social space within which to engage in positive dialogue that both challenges isolation and exclusion and helps foster increasing confidence and competence in the target language alongside feelings of inclusion for the majority of participants in the research...|$|R
