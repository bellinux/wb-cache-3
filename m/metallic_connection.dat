50|$|A {{transformer}} is {{an electrical}} device that transfers electrical energy between {{two or more}} circuits through electromagnetic induction. A varying current in one coil of the transformer produces a varying magnetic field, which in turn induces a voltage in a second coil.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for cohesively joining two <b>metallic</b> <b>connection</b> structures each having a planar or curved contact area region, which has a contact area with elevated microstructure elements that is assignable to the contact area region, comprises mutually contacting the two connection structures {{in such a way that}} material bonds form between the microstructure elements and the opposite connection structure, providing the microstructure elements on the contact area of the connection structure in the form of crystallites, which are elevated orthogonally with respect to the contact area, are formed like lines of ribs and with steep flanks and have a sharp-edged rib burr, where the arrangement of the contact area and formation in terms of form and size are subjected to stochastic distribution, and joining together the two connection structures in such a way that the microstructure elements of one of the connection structures contacted by their rib burrs with the contact area region of the other connection structure. The crystallites have a triangle-like base form in a cutting plane oriented orthogonal to the contact area, mutually touch or penetrate through along their respective rib lines, and provide by triangularly characterizable burr points locally along their rib burr in each case. The burr points have a point fillet with a radius of smaller than 1 mu m. The microstructure elements provided on the contact area of the connection structure have an average element height of 0. 5 - 10 mu m against the contact area. The crystallites have a rib longitudinal extension of 100 mu m at their basis in the region of the contact area and a rib thickness of up to 25 mu m. A surface portion conditioned by the rib burr at the entire contact area per connection structure is 20 %. The crystallites include a burr angle (alpha) of smaller than 60 degrees, where the burr angle is included by two crystal flanks. The microstructure elements are obtained in a way of direct galvanic deposition directly or indirectly on a substrate surface. The substrate surface consists of an electrically conductive material and/or is coated with an electrically conductive layer. The microstructure elements are deposited on the substrate surface or on the electrically conductive layer. The crystallites consist of metallurgical composition. The joining of the two connection structures takes place in a force-actuated manner, so that parts of the microstructure elements provided on one of the connection structures subject a deformation and/or penetrate with their rib burr into the other connection structure. The microstructure elements partially and mutually penetrate through the connection structures in case of providing the microstructure elements on the both connection structures during joining. The force-actuated joining of both connection structures is supported by ultrasonic introduction and/or thermal energy introduction into the joining area between the connection structures. The connection structures are formed for surface connection between the following components such as electronic components, integrated circuits, rigid or flexible wiring carrier in the form of a ceramic substrate, a printed circuit board or a flexible polymer substrate.

40|$|Recent {{studies showed}} {{the need for}} timber {{connections}} with high fire performance. Connections of members in timber structures commonly comprise steel connectors, such as dowels, screws, nails and toothed plates. However, multiple {{studies have shown that}} the presence of exposed metal in timber connections leads to a poor performance under fire conditions. Replacing metallic fasteners with non-metallic fasteners potentially enhances the fire performance of timber connections. Previous studies showed that Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) dowels can be a viable replacement for steel dowels and that Densified Veneer Wood functions well as a flitch plate material. However, as the resin matrix of GFRP dowels is viscoelastic, connection creep, which is not studied before, can be of concern. Also no research has been carried out on the fire performance of these connections. Therefore, a study of the creep behaviour and the fire performance of non-metallic timber connections comprising GFRP dowels and a Densified Veneer Wood flitch plate was performed, as is discussed in this thesis. Predictive models were proposed to determine the connection slip and load bearing capacity at ambient and elevated temperatures and in a fire. The material properties and heat transfer properties required for these models were determined experimentally and predictions of these models were experimentally validated. Furthermore, an adjustment of the predictive model of connection slip at ambient temperature allowed approximating the creep of the connection. The material properties, required for the creep model, were determined experimentally and predictions of the model were compared to results of longterm connection tests. The study confirmed that timber members jointed with non-metallic connectors have a significantly improved fire performance to timber joints using <b>metallic</b> <b>connections.</b> Models developed and proposed to predict fire performance gave accurate predictions of time to failure. It was concluded that non-metallic connections showed more creep per load per connector, than <b>metallic</b> <b>connections.</b> However, the ratio between initial deflection and creep (relative creep) and the ratio between load level and creep were shown to be similar for <b>metallic</b> and non-metallic <b>connections...</b>|$|R

40|$|We present first {{principles}} calculations of current-voltage characteristics (IVC) and conductance of Au(111) :S 2 -cumulene-S 2 :Au(111) molecular wire junctions with realistic contacts. The transport properties are calculated using full self-consistent ab initio NEGF-DFT methods under external bias. The conductance of the cumulene wires shows oscillatory behavior {{depending on the}} number of carbon atoms (double bonds). Among all conjugated oligomers, we find that cumulene wires with odd number of carbon atoms yield the highest conductance with metallic-like ballistic transport behavior. The reason is the high density of states in broad LUMO levels spanning the Fermi level of the electrodes. The transmission spectrum and the conductance depend only weakly on applied bias, and the IVC is nearly linear over a bias region from + 1 to - 1 V.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, left-handed (LH) meta-materials, {{characterized}} by anti-parallel phase and group velocities, have drawn considerable {{interest in the}} microwave community due to their potential for developing new types of devices and components. In such a movement of this research, we have proposed a super-compact multi-layered (ML) composite-right/left-handed (CRLH) transmission line (TL). This TL consists of U-shaped parallel plate LH unit cells connected to a ground enclosure by meander lines. In this architecture, the coupling between stacked U-shapes provides the LH series capacitance CL, and the meander line provides the LH shunt inductance LL, while the right-handed (RH) series inductance LR and the RH shunt capacitance CR are generated by the <b>metallic</b> <b>connections</b> {{in the direction of}} propagation and by the voltage gradient from the TL to the ground enclosure, respectively. In contrast to previously reported planar CRLH TLs, the multi-layered TL has its direction of propagation along the vertical direction, perpendicular to the plane of the substrates. Therefore, the large electrical length can be achieved over an extremely short TL length and small transverse footprint. In addition, it has a specific feature in the transmission parameter S 21 that the transmission zero can be created just above the LH passband, which characteristic is quite useful for the design of narrow passband response. However, this response could not be explained by the conventional CRLH equivalent circuit model.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel electrochemically assisted wet-etching method for maskless selective removal of metal layers. This method {{has been developed}} as the key process step for enabling the fabrication of low-loss 3 -D micromachined silicon-on-insulator-based radio-frequency microelectromechanical systems transmission line components, consisting of a silicon core in the device layer covered by a gold metallization layer. For this application, the full-wafer sputtered metallization layer must be locally removed on the handle layer to guarantee for a well-defined and low-loss coplanar-waveguide propagation mode in the slots of the transmission line. It {{is not possible to}} use conventional photolithography or shadow masking. Gold areas to be etched are biased by a 1. 2 -V potential difference to a saturated calomel reference electrode in a NaCl(aq) solution. The measured etch rate of the proposed local electrochemically biased etching process is 520 nm/min, and no detectable etching was observed on unbiased areas even after a 1 -h etch. The suitability of different adhesion layers has been investigated, and Ti-based adhesion layers were found to result in the highest yield. The new etching method has been successfully applied for the fabrication of transmission lines with integrated microswitches, lowering the insertion loss of the waveguide at 10 GHz from 1. 3 to 0. 3 dB/mm. The issue of unwanted thin <b>metallic</b> <b>connections</b> caused by secondary deposition during sputtering is discussed but found not to significantly affect the process yield. Finally, local removal of gold on isolated features even within the device layer is presented for locally removing the metallization on stoppers of laterally moving electrostatic actuators, to drastically reduce the mechanical wear on stopper tips. © 2011 IEEE.

40|$|Bolted {{connections}} {{are widely used}} in various industrial sectors. Different loading conditions to which the {{connections are}} subjected can result in looseness of bolts, entailing timely detection to avoid system failure due to this. Linear ultrasonic inspection-based methods are currently the prevailing approaches in non-destructive evaluation (NDE) to serve this purpose. However these methods may lose their effectiveness when used to detect slight looseness of bolts. In this study, two nonlinear NDE approaches for detection of bolt loosening, using second harmonic nonlinearity of Lamb waves and vibro-acoustic modulation (VM), respectively, were developed. An analytical model based on Hertzian contact theory was proposed to establish a correlation between applied torques on a bolted joint and its contact acoustic nonlinear behaviours. These two approaches were validated experimentally by detecting bolt loosening in both <b>metallic</b> and composite <b>connections.</b> In the first approach, Lamb waves were introduced by a low-profile piezoceramic wafer, and an acoustic nonlinear parameter was calculated from the magnitude of extracted second harmonic of the Lamb waves; in the second approach, two harmonic excitations (i. e., a low-frequency vibration and a high-frequency probing wave) were produced by a shaker and a piezoceramic stack actuator, respectively, and the response sidebands were identified in spectra, to ascertain a modulation index. The variation of the nonlinear parameter and the modulation index, subjected to the torque applied on the bolt, {{has been found in}} a good agreement with theoretical prediction using the model.
