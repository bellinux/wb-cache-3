40|$|Septic {{implications}} at patients aren’t a rarity, {{especially in}} surgical, pediatric and obstetric practice now. However not enough attention, despite epidemic {{of this disease}} is paid to implication of a sepsis at patients with HIV infection now. Clinical laboratory implications of a sepsis at 36 patients with HIV infection are analysed. The main group is presented by patients with a lethal outcome (n = 18), control — with a positive outcome of a stationary stage of treatment (n = 18). Work is carried out on materials of the Infectious hospital No. 1 of D. M. Dalmatov of Omsk. At HIV-positive patients the stage of secondary diseases met most more often. Anti-retrovirus therapy was accepted only by 33 % of patients in control group. At the died patients the hyperthermia arose after development of complaints from organs and systems and lasted less than 15 days. Low indicators of the CD 4 + lymphocytes and a high virus load of HIV in a blood of patients with a lethal outcome became perceptible. In the general blood test thrombocytopenias, eosinopenias, <b>monocytopenias,</b> in the biochemical analysis — augmentation of the general bilirubin, thymol turbidity test, prothrombin ratio, urea were more often taped. At a bacteriological blood analysis various microflora with prevalence of S. aureus, sometimes in combination with Gram-negative flora was taped. Symptoms of an infectious endocarditis were taped at every second dead of the HIV-positive patient. Almost at all patients radiological changes in a pulmonary tissue were taped. Thus, clinical implications at patients with HIV infection are few symptoms and not typicalness that demands further studying. </p...|$|R

40|$|The role of granulocytes and monocytes {{during the}} {{induction}} and course of Escherichia coli endocarditis {{was investigated in}} rabbits by selectively depleting monocytes from the circulation with the drug VP 16 - 213 and granulocytes and monocytes with nitrogen mustard. For induction, the number of E. coli needed to infect the vegetations in 50 % of the rabbits was significantly lower in rabbits with combined granulocytopenia and <b>monocytopenia</b> than in those with selective <b>monocytopenia</b> or in control rabbits, whereas the number of E. coli needed to infect 50 % of the rabbits did not differ between the latter two. During {{the course of the}} endocarditis in endocardial vegetations, the numbers of CFU per gram of vegetation were significantly higher in the rabbits with combined granulocytopenia and <b>monocytopenia</b> than in the monocytopenic and control rabbits but did not differ between the latter two. The numbers of granulocytes in the circulation and the numbers of CFU per gram of vegetation showed a significant negative correlation that was not measurably influenced by the duration of the disease but was dependent on the number of E. coli injected for the induction of endocarditis. Granulocytes were found to be most effective at the lowest numbers of bacteria injected. In the circulation, too, the numbers of CFU per milliliter were significantly higher in rabbits with combined granulocytopenia and <b>monocytopenia</b> than in those with selective <b>monocytopenia</b> and control rabbits, and there was a significant negative correlation between the numbers of granulocytes and CFU per milliliter of blood.

40|$|In mice with {{prolonged}} severe <b>monocytopenia</b> {{induced by}} selective irradiation {{of the bone}} marrow with the bone-seeking isotope 89 Sr, the proliferative capacity of Kupffer cells was studied by immunohistochemistry with an anti-mouse macrophage monoclonal antibody, F 4 / 80, ultrastructural peroxidase (P 0) cytochemistry, and tritiated thymidine (3 HTdR) autoradiography. The number and 3 HTdR uptake of Kupffer cells were signifi-cantly increased in the splenectomized mice after severe <b>monocytopenia</b> had continued for more than 4 wk, and almost all the Kupifer cells showed a localization pattern of P 0 activity {{similar to that of}} resident macrophages in the liver of normal mice. In the glucan-induced granuloma formation in similar monocytopenic mice, Kupifer cells proliferated, conglomerated, and transformed into epithelioid cells, which fused together to become multinuclear giant cells.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} and kinetics of the immunosuppressive effects of alternate-day prednisone were investigated {{in a group}} of patients with a variety of inflammatory diseases receiving a range of alternate-day prednisone doses from 5 to 120 mg. Total circulating lymphocyte and monocyte counts, as well as proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations defined both by surface markers and by in vitro functional capacities, were studied. At 8 a. m. of the day on prednisone, just before drug administration, lymphocyte and monocyte counts, proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations, as well as in vitro lymphocyte blastogenic responses to various mitogenic and antigenic stimuli were normal. 4 h after the administration of prednisone, there was a profound lymphocytopenia and <b>monocytopenia,</b> with a differential depletion of thymus-derived lymphocytes as well as various functionally defined lymphocyte subpopulations. Lymphocyte kinetic studies using a radioactive chromium-labeled autologous lymphocytes showed that the lymphocytopenia was due predominantly to a transient depletion of the recirculating portion of the intravascular lymphocytepool. All these parameters returned to normal by 8 a. m. of the following day (off prednisone) and remained normal throughout the day. This very transient lymphocytopenia and <b>monocytopenia</b> after prednisone, with normal cell numbers, proportions, and functions throughout the remainder of the 2 -day cycle, was associated with suppression of disease activity, yet did not affect cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity in these patients nor increase the likelihood of infectious complications.

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of Legionella pneumophila pneumonia occurred in 6 of 49 new renal transplant recipients {{over the course}} of 13 months. We compared infected patients (cases) and uninfected patients (controls) with respect to potential risk factors. Corticosteroid use, need for hemodialysis and number of days of hemodialysis were significantly greater among the cases. Logistic regression analysis identified corticosteroid dosage and number of days of hemodialysis as independent risk factors. Lymphopenia and <b>monocytopenia</b> were correlated with the amount of corticosteroid administered and occurred to a greater degree in the cases. All clinical isolates were of L. pneumophila serogroup 1, subtype Philadelphia 1, which was also cultured from a recovery room sink outside the operating room where the transplants were done.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate whether}} hematologic and immunologic effects observed after bacteremia and endotoxemia in the host could be replicated by administration of recombinant human interleukin- 1 alpha (IL- 1 alpha) in a primate model. Furthermore, to determine whether endogenously produced interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) contributes to the changes observed during endotoxemia or gram-negative septic shock, a specific IL- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 ra) was administered. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria initiates a constellation of metabolic and immunologic host responses. IL- 1, a macrophage-derived cytokine, acts as a key mediator in the host response to infection and inflammation. METHODS: Baboons {{were randomly assigned to}} receive either recombinant human IL- 1 alpha, LPS, or live Escherichia coli both with or without concomitant administration of IL- 1 ra. Blood was collected hourly and analyzed using flow cytometric techniques. RESULTS: Both endotoxemia and live E. coli bacteremia induced an acute granulocytopenia; however, the granulocytopenia gradually resolved in the endotoxemic group, but was sustained in the bacteremic group. An early lymphopenia and <b>monocytopenia</b> was elicited by LPS or E. coli and persisted throughout the experiment. Recombinant human IL- 1 alpha induced the following: (1) an early, transient decline in granulocytes followed by a sustained granulocytosis; (2) a lymphopenia; and (3) a transient <b>monocytopenia</b> followed by a gradual return to baseline. Although IL- 1 ra had no effect on leukocyte kinetics with either live E. coli or LPS, the IL- 1 ra significantly abrogated the <b>monocytopenia</b> seen with recombinant human IL- 1 alpha administration alone. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that administration of recombinant human IL- 1 alpha can replicate some of the characteristic patterns of hematologic change associated with bacteremia and endotoxemia. However, an endogenous IL- 1 response is not required for these changes to occur. Rather, the data suggest that other inflammatory mediators induced by endotoxemia or gram-negative bacteremia, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), may be involved...|$|E

40|$|To {{elucidate}} mechanisms {{underlying the}} prolonged <b>monocytopenia</b> induced in the peripheral blood of mice by injection of a subcutaneous depot of hydrocortisone acetate, {{the effect of}} this compound on the production of monocytes and their release from the bone marrow was studied. Hydrocortisone was found to cause a rapid reduction of the bone marrow promonocytes to about 65 % of their initial number. The number of monocytes in the bone marrow decreased gradually, over a period of 96 h, to 75 % of the initial value. The mitotic activity of the promonocytes was not diminished, as judged from the labeling in vitro with [3 H]thymidine and the DNA-synthesis and cell-cycle times of these cells. The production of monocytes was only moderately diminished, i. e., to about 80 % of the normal amount. The release of monocytes from the bone marrow was found to be influenced by hydrocortisone. After in vivo labeling with [3 H]thymidine the monocyte-labeling indices were initially significantly higher in hydrocortisone-treated than in normal mice. It is concluded that a decreased production of monocytes in the bone marrow cannot account for the prolonged <b>monocytopenia</b> in the peripheral blood after hydrocortisone administration. However, hydrocortisone interferes with the release of newly formed monocytes from the bone marrow, resulting in a prolonged sojourn of these cells in this compartment...|$|E
40|$|The {{administration}} of glucocorticosteroids {{results in a}} wide range of effects on inflammatory and immunologically mediated disease processes. Glucocorticosteroids cause neutrophilic leukocytosis together with eosinopenia, <b>monocytopenia,</b> and lymphocytopenia. A principal mechanism whereby corticosteroids suppress inflammation is their impeding the access of neutrophils and monocytes to an inflammatory site. Granulocyte function is relatively refractory, whereas monocyte-macrophage function seems to be particularly sensitive to corticosteroids. Corticosteroid administration causes a transient lymphocytopenia of all detectable lymphocyte subpopulations, particularly the recirculating thymus-derived lymphocyte. The mechanism of this lymphocytopenia is probably a redistribution of circulating cells to other body compartments. There i...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground & AimsAutoimmune {{hepatitis}} (AIH), an immune-mediated liver disease, originates as {{a consequence}} of interacting genetic and environmental risk factors. Treatment remains non-specific and prone to side effects. Deficiencies in regulatory T cell (Treg) function are hypothesized to contribute to the pathogenesis of AIH. MethodsWe describe an adult patient who presented with AIH in the context of <b>monocytopenia.</b> The patient was characterized by GATA 2 gene sequencing, flow cytometry of peripheral blood for leucocyte subsets, ELISA for serum Flt- 3 ligand, and immunohistochemistry of liver biopsy tissue. ResultsSequencing confirmed a GATA 2 mutation. Peripheral Treg were absent {{in the context of a}} preserved total T cell count. Immunostaining for the Treg transcription factor FOXP 3 was reduced in liver tissue as compared to a control AIH specimen. There were marked deficiencies in multiple antigen-presenting cell subsets and Flt- 3 ligand was elevated. These findings are consistent with previous reports of GATA 2 dysfunction. ConclusionsThe association of a GATA 2 mutation with AIH is previously unrecognized. GATA 2 encodes a hematopoietic cell transcription factor, and mutations may manifest as <b>monocytopenia,</b> dendritic and B cell deficiencies, myelodysplasia, and immunodeficiency. Tregs may be depleted as in this case. Our findings provide support for the role of Tregs in AIH, complement reports of other deficiencies in T cell regulation causing AIH-like syndromes, and support the rationale of attempting to modulate the Treg axis for the therapeutic benefit of AIH patients...|$|E

The study was carried out in malaria holo-endemic settlements in northern Nigeria, among 313 children with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria randomly selected, between July and September, 2012 using therapeutic efficacy protocols on antimalarial drugs. There were no cases of lympopenia, and recoveries were faster in AT+SP than AQ+SP for leucocytosis (37. 5 % vs 17. 39 %), anaemia (82. 23 % vs 78. 03 %), thrombocytopenia (90. 13 % vs 88. 20 %), monocytosis (30. 92 % vs 28. 01 %) and eosinophilia (31. 68 %) than AQ+SP (18. 01 %) in 28 days.

The blood samples were collected from 608 healthy, medically examined athletes (181 females and 427 males) aged 20. 1 ± 5. 1 years, who represented five sport disciplines: canoeing, judo, rowing, swimming and volleyball. All blood samples were taken from the antecubital vein in the morning, after overnight fasting, in a seated position. Haematological analyses were conducted using a haematology analyser (ADVIA 120, Siemens). Neutropenia (defined as neutrophil count < 2. 0 [*]·[*] 10 [sup] 9 [/sup]·L[sup]- 1 [/sup]) was found in athletes of both sexes in each discipline.

In patients with "final common pathway " malignant melanoma, there was a highly significant deficiency in macrophage precursors (MPs). By conventional morphological criteria such patients did not show a significant <b>monocytopenia.</b> Serum factors do not seem to contribute to the MP defect in the patients. We conclude that these patients have an intrinsic functional defect in their peripheral blood monocytes, but the mechanisms responsible for this defect are as yet unknown. CONTEMPORARY studies ofhost responses to malignant cells have concentrated on the mechanics of adaptive or acquired immunity, and have in consequence emphasized the role of highly specific cellmediated or humoral reactions directed against tumour-specific transplantatio...|$|E
40|$|Beige mice, {{which are}} a homolog of the Chediak-Higashi syndrome, and mice treated with 89 Sr to destroy the bone marrow provide animal models of defects in {{mononuclear}} phagocyte and natural killer cell functions. The innate resistance of these mice to viruses such as herpes simplex and encephalomyocarditis viruses, however, is normal. Moreover, treatment of the mice with immunomodulators such as Propionibacterium acnes (formerly designated Corynebacterium parvum) and pyran produced {{a significant increase in}} resistance to encephalomyocarditis virus. The antiviral effect of P. acnes in 89 Sr-treated mice was exhibited during marked <b>monocytopenia</b> and without evidence for an inflammatory influx of macrophages into the peritoneal cavity. Treatment with P. acnes was also effective in increasing the resistance of beige mice to infection with Listeria monocytogenes. Thus, immunomodulators can be effective in mice that exhibit impaired macrophage and natural killer cell functions...|$|E
40|$|Ten {{patients}} with progressive hairy cell leukemia {{were treated with}} 2 ’deoxycoformycin (dCF) by intravenous bolus (4 mg/m 2) given every other week. All ten patients are evaluable for response and nine of the ten patients have achieved a complete remission. In addition to clearing of hairy cells from the bone marrow, eight patients had resolution of their <b>monocytopenia.</b> Seven of the nine patients remain in unmaintained remission with a median duration of 6. 2 months. Two patients have had relapse in the bone marrow alone and continue to have normal H AIRY cell leukemia was first described at the Ohio State University by Bouroncle, Wiseman, and Doan in 1958, as a new hematologic and pathologic entity) It is a chronic form of leukemia usually manifested by splenomega-ly, pancytopenia, and the presence in the blood and bon...|$|E
40|$|Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are {{involved}} in the recognition of bacterial products and thus participate in the induction of the inflammatory cascade. However, much less is known about the evolution of leucocyte TLR expression during human inflammatory stress. We hypothesized that a decrease in leucocyte TLRs could account for the so-called tolerance or hyporesponsiveness state to subsequent stimulation with bacteria-derived products. Because of the profound <b>monocytopenia</b> that ensues after in vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge, we also compared monocyte TLR expression using two different techniques of flow cytometric gating. In a first set of experiments, 17 healthy volunteers underwent LPS challenge. Blood was drawn at different time-points and analysed by flow cytometry using light scatter gating and one-colour analysis to assess the expression of the tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) and TLR 2 and TLR 4 on both monocytes and granulocytes. In a second set of experiments, the assessment of those receptors was made using a more specific gating method that utilized light scatter and CD 14 immunofluorescence in a two-colour analysis. This was performed using whole blood drawn from five healthy volunteers and incubated ex vivo for different time periods with or without LPS and in 12 volunteers who underwent LPS challenge in vivo. The pattern of expression for monocyte TNFR was similar for both types of gating. Using only the light scatter gating, an initial drop of TLR 2 and 4 was observed on monocytes. By contrast, when using light scatter × immunofluorescence gating, an up-regulation of these two receptors following both in vivo and in vitro LPS exposure was observed. LPS up-regulates the expression of TLRs on monocytes and granulocytes. Depending upon the methodology utilized, contrasting results were obtained with respect to TLR 2 and TLR 4 expression. The flow cytometric gating technique used is of importance in determining cellular TLR 2 and TLR 4 expression, especially in blood samples exhibiting significant <b>monocytopenia...</b>|$|E
