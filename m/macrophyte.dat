5|$|The {{ecosystem}} of Dal is ecologically rich in macrophytes, submerged macrophytes, floating macrophytes and phytoplankton. <b>Macrophyte</b> flora {{recorded in}} the lake's aquatic and marshland environment consists of 117 species, belonging to 69 genera and 42 families. The lake is noted in particular for its Nelumbo nucifera (lotus flowers) which bloom in July and August. The prolific growth of Ceratophyllum demersum in the eutrophic zones has been reported, with Myriophyllum spicatum and Potemogetton lucens cited as dominant species. Other macrophytes discerned in different zones of the lake include Typho angustata, Phragmites australis, Myriophyllum, Sparganium evectum and Myriophyllum verticillatum, which contribute {{to the production of}} macrophites. The rooted variety of the floating leaf type consists of Neelambium nucifera, Nymphaea alba, N.Tertagonia, N.Candida, Nymphoides peltatum, Salvinia natans, Hydrocharis dubia, Nymphaea sp. and Potamogeton natans, all of which occupy 29.2% of the lake. Phytoplanktons include Navicula radiosa, Nitzschia accicularis, Fragilaria crotonensis, Diatoma elongatum, Scenedesmus bijuga, Pediastrum duplex, Tetraedron minimum, Microcystis aeruginosa and Merismopedia elegans.|$|E
5|$|A {{scientific}} study of the water quality parameters of physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics and role of phumdis in the Loktak Lake has been conducted by collecting surface water samples on monthly basis from 15 stations, representing 5 zones; northern, western, eastern, middle and southern. The test results indicated that water quality in the phumdi area was poor in {{the northern and southern}} zones of the lake; test results indicated low dissolved oxygen, low pH (normal range for pH in surface water systems is 6.5 to 8.5) high CO2 and high Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) but the water quality was good in the open water area. Assessment of the total nitrogen content of the <b>macrophyte</b> species of phumdis indicated that the following were present in descending order: Salvinia natans (1.8%), Zizania latifolia (1.6%), Capillipedium sp. (1.3%), Brachiaria mutica (1.2%), Cyperus brevifolius (1.2%), Echinochloa stagnina (1.0%), Phragmites karka (1.0%) and Hedychium coranarium (0.94%). The test results confirmed the fact that the phumdis were efficient in absorbing nutrients from the lake water. However, they deteriorated water quality due to reduced light penetration and accumulation of organic matter in the lake ecosystem.|$|E

25|$|Constructed {{wetlands}} {{are designed}} to remove stormwater pollutants associated with fine to colloidal particles and dissolved contaminants. These shallow, extensively vegetated water bodies use enhanced sedimentation, fine filtration and biological uptake to remove these pollutants. They usually comprise three zones: an inlet zone (sedimentation basin) to remove coarse sediments; a <b>macrophyte</b> zone, a heavily vegetated area to remove fine particulates and uptake of soluble pollutants; and a high flow bypass channel to protect the <b>macrophyte</b> zone. The <b>macrophyte</b> zone generally includes a marsh zone {{as well as an}} open water zone and has an extended depth of 0.25 to 0.5m with specialist plant species and a retention time of 48 to 72 hours. Constructed Wetlands can also provide a flow control function by rising during rainfall and then slowly releasing the stored flows. Constructed wetlands will improve the runoff water quality depending on the wetland processes. The key treatment mechanism of wetlands are physical (trapping suspended solids and adsorbed pollutants), biological and chemical uptake (trapping dissolved pollutants, chemical adsorption of pollutants), and pollutant transformation (more stable sediment fixation, microbial processes, UV disinfection).|$|E

In this chapter, we argue that <b>macrophytes</b> occupy the center of trophic interactions in shallow lakes, influ- encing outcomes through structural, behavioral and chemical interactions. We define shallow lakes as permanently flooded wetlands that often contain submerged or floating <b>macrophytes</b> and that may be surrounded by emergent vegetation (i. e. marshy habitat). Shallow remains a relative term in limnology circles, but typically is less than 3 m average depth, such that <b>macrophytes</b> can fill {{a substantial portion of the}} water column and stratification is neither pre- dictable nor long-term.

40|$|Abstract Aim: The goal of {{this study}} was to analyze the effects of {{predation}} by nymphs of Erythemis Hagen, 1861 on Elmidae and Chironomidae and to check if the presence and the architecture of aquatic <b>macrophytes</b> may mediate this interaction. Methods: All prey as well as nymphs were captured near <b>macrophytes</b> in a small lagoon alongside a highway near Humaitá, Amazonas, Brazil. Twelve buckets were used in three different treatments: with Pistia stratiotes Linnaeus, 1753, with Salvinia auriculata Aublet and without <b>macrophytes.</b> Results: We found a mortality rate of 100 % of Chironomidae and Elmidae larvae in the treatment without <b>macrophytes.</b> There was a greater survival of Elmidae compared to Chironomidae in the treatments with P. stratiotes and S. auriculata; however, there was a greater survival of both preys on treatment with P. stratiotes. Conclusions: We conclude that the presence of <b>macrophytes</b> decreased the efficiency of predation of Erythemis nymphs under experimental conditions.

40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>macrophytes</b> in P cycling was studied in Nýrsko Reservoir, an oligotrophic water body in western Bohemia. A {{comparison of the}} external P loading with the P content in <b>macrophytes</b> of Nýrsko Reservoir in 2004 demonstrated that <b>macrophytes</b> can {{play a significant role}} in P-cycling also in deep, pelagial-dominated water bodies on condition that the external P loading is low and <b>macrophytes</b> have appropriate conditions for their growth (mainly small extent of water level fluctuation).

2500|$|Zooplankton {{are tiny}} animals {{suspended}} {{in the water column}}. [...] Like phytoplankton, these species have developed mechanisms that keep them from sinking to deeper waters, including drag-inducing body forms and the active flicking of appendages such as antennae or spines. Remaining in the water column may have its advantages in terms of feeding, but this zone’s lack of refugia leaves zooplankton vulnerable to predation. [...] In response, some species, especially Daphnia sp., make daily vertical migrations in the water column by passively sinking to the darker lower depths during the day and actively moving towards the surface during the night. Also, because conditions in a lentic system can be quite variable across seasons, zooplankton have the ability to switch from laying regular eggs to resting eggs when {{there is a lack of}} food, temperatures fall below 2°C, or if predator abundance is high. [...] These resting eggs have a diapause, or dormancy period that should allow the zooplankton to encounter conditions that are more favorable to survival when they finally hatch. The invertebrates that inhabit the benthic zone are numerically dominated by small species and are species rich compared to the zooplankton of the open water. [...] They include Crustaceans (e.g. crabs, crayfish, and shrimp), molluscs (e.g. clams and snails), and numerous types of insects. These organisms are mostly found in the areas of <b>macrophyte</b> growth, where the richest resources, highly oxygenated water, and warmest portion of the ecosystem are found. [...] The structurally diverse <b>macrophyte</b> beds are important sites for the accumulation of organic matter, and provide an ideal area for colonization. [...] The sediments and plants also offer a great deal of protection from predatory fishes.|$|E
