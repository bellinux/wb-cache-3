5|$|Paleoclimatologists {{measure the}} ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the shells and skeletons of <b>marine</b> <b>organisms</b> to {{determine}} the climate {{millions of years ago}} (see oxygen isotope ratio cycle). Seawater molecules that contain the lighter isotope, oxygen-16, evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the 12% heavier oxygen-18, and this disparity increases at lower temperatures. During periods of lower global temperatures, snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen-16, and the seawater left behind tends to be higher in oxygen-18. <b>Marine</b> <b>organisms</b> then incorporate more oxygen-18 into their skeletons and shells than they would in a warmer climate. Paleoclimatologists also directly measure this ratio in the water molecules of ice core samples as old as hundreds of thousands of years.|$|E
5|$|An {{equivalent}} active camouflage strategy, {{known to}} zoologists as counter-illumination, {{is used by}} many <b>marine</b> <b>organisms,</b> notably cephalopods such as the midwater squid, Abralia veranyi. The underside is covered with small photophores, organs that produce light. The squid varies {{the intensity of the}} light according to the brightness of the sea surface far above, providing effective camouflage by painting out the animal's silhouette with light.|$|E

40|$|Fisherman {{community}} {{people will}} have significant value if they used powder form of <b>marine</b> <b>organism</b> for wound healing caused by MRSA. The bioactivity was more prevalent in sponge, Spirastrella inconstans compared to other <b>marine</b> <b>organism.</b> The protein was fractioned by ammonium sulphate precipitation method and purified using dialysis. About 1000 ?l of dialysate were loaded on Sephadex G- 50 chromatographic column and purified 75 fractions at each percentage of saturation were collected. The fraction no. 3, 4 (40 % saturation) and no. 4 (60 % saturation) bears maximum protein content. Amount of protein content was estimated in UV-Vis Spectrophotometer, preliminary detection of compound {{was carried out by}} TLC. Two fractions were efficient and their R f values were found to be similar to that of glutamic acid. The molecular weight of protein was calculated as 3 000 Da by SDS-PAGE. Marine bacterial cultures were isolated and enzymes (amylase, DNase, esculinase, lipase, gelatinase and alginase) were produced and lipase bearing maximum activity was treated against MRSA.

5|$|Crystal fibres, formed of {{hexagonal}} {{arrays of}} hollow nanofibres, create the bright iridescent colours of the bristles of Aphrodita, the sea mouse, a non-wormlike genus of marine annelids. The colours are aposematic, warning predators not to attack. The chitin {{walls of the}} hollow bristles form a hexagonal honeycomb-shaped photonic crystal; the hexagonal holes are 0.51 μm apart. The structure behaves optically as if it consisted of a stack of 88 diffraction gratings, making Aphrodita {{one of the most}} iridescent of <b>marine</b> <b>organisms.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cultured mysids {{are thought}} to provide an ideal food source for many <b>marine</b> <b>organisms.</b> They are often fed to cephalopods, fish larvae, and {{commercial}} farmed shrimp due to their small size and low cost.

Mixed coal balls are further divided into heterogeneous, where the plant and animal material was distinctly separated; and homogeneous, lacking that separation.|$|E
5|$|Isopods first {{appeared}} in the fossil record during the Carboniferous period of the Paleozoic some 300 million years ago. They were primitive, short-tailed members of the suborder Phreatoicidea. At that time, Phreatoicideans were <b>marine</b> <b>organisms</b> with a cosmopolitan distribution. Nowadays, the members of this formerly widespread suborder form relic populations in freshwater environments in South Africa, India and Oceania, the greatest number of species being in Tasmania. Other primitive, short-tailed suborders include Asellota, Microcerberidea, Calabozoidea and the terrestrial Oniscidea.|$|E

In vertebrates the concentration is slightly lower, and nearly all vertebrate tissue and body fluids contain lithium ranging from 21 to 763 ppb. <b>Marine</b> <b>organisms</b> tend to bioaccumulate lithium more than terrestrial organisms.

5|$|The {{existence}} of aposematism in marine ecosystems is controversial. Many <b>marine</b> <b>organisms,</b> particularly those on coral reefs, are brightly coloured or patterned, including sponges, corals, molluscs and fishes, {{with little or}} no connection to chemical or physical defenses. Caribbean reef sponges are brightly coloured, {{and many of them are}} chemically defended, but there is no relationship between the two factors.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods are shelled <b>marine</b> <b>organisms</b> that superficially resembled {{bivalves}} in {{that they}} are of similar size and have a hinged shell in two parts. However, brachiopods evolved from a very different ancestral line, and the resemblance to bivalves only arose because of a similar lifestyle. The {{differences between the two groups}} are due to their separate ancestral origins. Different initial structures have been adapted to solve the same problems, a case of convergent evolution. In modern times, brachiopods are not as common as bivalves.|$|E
5|$|Counter-illumination means {{producing}} {{light to}} match a background that is brighter than an animal's body or military vehicle; it {{is a form}} of active camouflage. It is notably used by some species of squid, such as the firefly squid and the midwater squid. The latter has light-producing organs (photophores) scattered all over its underside; these create a sparkling glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below. Counterillumination camouflage is the likely function of the bioluminescence of many <b>marine</b> <b>organisms,</b> though light is also produced to attract or to detect prey and for signalling.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge {{proposed}} {{the theory of}} punctuated equilibrium which holds that stasis is the most prominent feature of the fossil record, and that most evolutionary changes occur rapidly over relatively short periods of time. In 1980 Luis Alvarez and Walter Alvarez {{proposed the}} hypothesis that an impact event {{was responsible for the}} Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Also in the early 1980s, statistical analysis of the fossil record of <b>marine</b> <b>organisms</b> published by Jack Sepkoski and David M.

5|$|In the 19th century, Belgian {{physicist}} Joseph Plateau examined soap films, {{leading him}} to formulate {{the concept of}} a minimal surface. German biologist and artist Ernst Haeckel painted hundreds of <b>marine</b> <b>organisms</b> to emphasise their symmetry. Scottish biologist D'Arcy Thompson pioneered the study of growth patterns in both plants and animals, showing that simple equations could explain spiral growth. In the 20th century, British mathematician Alan Turing predicted mechanisms of morphogenesis which give rise to patterns of spots and stripes. Hungarian biologist Aristid Lindenmayer and French American mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot showed how the mathematics of fractals could create plant growth patterns.|$|E

Another project working towards conservation is CenSeam, a Census of Marine Life project formed in 2005. CenSeam is intended to provide the framework needed to prioritise, integrate, expand and facilitate seamount research efforts in order to significantly reduce the unknown and build towards a global understanding of seamount ecosystems, and the roles they have in the biogeography, biodiversity, productivity and evolution of <b>marine</b> <b>organisms.</b>|$|E
