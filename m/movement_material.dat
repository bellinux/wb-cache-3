5000|$|Projected text {{has become}} a {{signature}} mark of Greenberg’s choreography. The first use of it was in [...] "MacGuffin, or How Meanings Get Lost". It wasn’t until [...] "N-A-A-D" [...] that the text became a way to reveal information about the performers. In [...] "Destiny Dance" [...] Greenberg first used video in rehearsal {{as a way to}} cull set <b>movement</b> <b>material</b> from his own improvisation. In [...] "Really Queer Dance with Harps" [...] Greenberg expanded from just using his own improvisations to create material that his dancers learned, to deriving <b>movement</b> <b>material</b> from his dancers' improvisations as well.|$|E

50|$|Kliën {{developed}} {{a series of}} new choreographic methods including non-linear, distributed and dialogical procedures as well as improvisation methodologies for dance. Underlying these is a mapping procedure that allows dancers to embody their streams of consciousness in real {{time as well as}} Kliën’s notion of ‘Sedimenting’, meaning the accumulation of selected <b>movement</b> <b>material</b> through learning in real-time as integral part of the choreography.|$|E
50|$|In 1953, two bibliophiles, Eddie (Edmund) Frow and Ruth Haines, {{met at a}} Communist Party Summer School. In 1956, {{they set}} up home {{together}} and the merger of their book collections {{was the beginning of}} the Working Class Movement Library. They spent their spare time and money travelling around Britain, gathering new items for the collection. By 1960, the collection was being consulted by historians and academics, and they had attracted the support of other collectors of labour <b>movement</b> <b>material.</b> In 1964, they gained charitable trust status.|$|E
50|$|Consistent {{with many}} of Schumann's other works, the concerto {{utilizes}} both fully realized and fragmentary thematic material introduced in the first <b>movement,</b> <b>material</b> which is then quoted and developed throughout. Together with the concerto's relatively short, linked movements, the concerto is thus extremely unified both in material and in character, although the work's emotional scope is very wide. Schumann's use of the same themes but in very different contexts and moods lends the cello concerto {{a strong sense of}} character development and an extended emotional arc, from its opening measures vacillating between deeply meditative and agitated to the brilliant, affirmative conclusion.|$|E
5000|$|Matter: {{a change}} or <b>{{movement}}'s</b> <b>material</b> [...] "cause", is {{the aspect of}} the change or movement which {{is determined by the}} material that composes the moving or changing things. For a table, that might be wood; for a statue, that might be bronze or marble.|$|R

50|$|Initially the {{magazine}} served a dual purpose. It {{was a record}} and site of activity for the mail/correspondence-art <b>movement.</b> <b>Material</b> for {{the magazine}} was sourced from submissions by a network of mail-art correspondents (fostered by General Ideas national and international connections), and can thus {{be said that the}} magazine was the first mail-art project in magazine format. Each issue featured a directory of the members of this network, including their pseudonyms (the adoption of which was a common practice amongst members) and addresses. Via this list, members could publish requests for found images (the list was discontinued from the magazine in 1976).|$|E
50|$|Each {{movement}} {{opens with}} a slow melody marked mesto (sadly). This material is employed for only a relatively short introduction in the first movement, but is longer {{in the second and}} longer again in the third. In the fourth movement, the mesto material, with reminiscences of the first <b>movement</b> <b>material,</b> consumes the entire movement. It can be seen from Bartók's sketches that he had intended the last movement to have a quick, Romanian folk dance-like character with an aksak rhythmic character, but he abandoned this plan, whether motivated by pure compositional logic or despair at the impending death of his mother and the unfolding catastrophe of the war.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the element of projected text, Greenberg delved into the use of video in 2003 with his dance “Two”. A projection on {{the back wall of}} the theatre, behind the stage, shows live feed images being captured on stage, as well as footage of Greenberg doing <b>movement</b> <b>material</b> that is taking place simultaneously on stage, but by other dancers. There is also a video monitor on stage that shows footage of various forms of running; horses, people’s feet, and a Japanese woman in a kimono. Greenberg’s next piece, “Partial View” continued his exploration into media - also using both pre-recorded and live feed video. The prerecorded video was courtesy of theatre artist John Jesurun and was displayed on two screens {{at the back of the}} stage. The live feed switched perspectives, from birds-eye views to closeups.|$|E

5000|$|According to {{his wife}} Candie, one of Guy's most {{important}} roles during the Civil Rights Movement—more so than introducing [...] "We Shall Overcome" [...] as a Freedom Song—was his desire to record and archive {{the evolution of the}} movement through song. Both Guy and Candie believe that the political usage of religious and folk music could shape movements and influence people to take action in social change, and Guy's initiative to record and preserve the already established Freedom Songs within the movement are used to inspire and to educate future leaders and activists.Movement leader Rev. C. T. Vivian, a lieutenant of Martin Luther King reminisced:I don’t think we had ever thought of spirituals as <b>movement</b> <b>material.</b> When the movement came up, we couldn’t apply them. The concept has to be there. It wasn’t just to have the music but to take the music out of our past and apply it to the new situation, to change it so it really fit.... The first time I remember any change in our songs was when Guy came down from Highlander. Here he was with this guitar and tall thin frame, leaning forward and patting that foot. I remember James Bevel and I looked across at each other and smiled. Guy had taken this song, [...] "Follow the Drinking Gourd" [...] - I didn't know the song, but he gave some background on it and boom - that began to make sense. And, little by little, spiritual after spiritual began to appear with new words and changes: “"Keep Your Eyes on the Prize", [...] "Hold On" [...] or [...] "I’m Going to Sit at the Welcome Table". Once we had seen it done, we could begin to do it.|$|E
