The (second) Ericsson cycle is also the limit of an ideal gas-turbine Brayton cycle, operating with multistage intercooled compression, and <b>multistage</b> <b>expansion</b> with reheat and regeneration. Compared to the Brayton cycle which uses adiabatic compression and expansion, the second Ericsson cycle uses isothermal compression and expansion, thus producing more net work per stroke. Also the use of regeneration in the Ericsson cycle increases efficiency by reducing the required heat input. For further comparisons of thermodynamic cycles, see heat engine.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for solving a {{large-scale}} <b>multistage</b> transmission <b>expansion</b> planning problem. The formulated problem is of a large-scale mixed integer linear programming which is difficult to handle by general mathematical optimization techniques. A disjunctive model for a single stage transmission expansion planning is extended for solving the multistage model. In addition, a local branching method is employed with an initial solution obtained from the single stage transmission expansion planning problem. The proposed method has been tested with IEEE 24 -bus and a northeastern Thailand power system to show it is efficient to implement for actual power system planning...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} data on cancer {{incidence}} in the USA, the Netherlands, and in Hong Kong indicate a flattening {{and perhaps a}} turnover at advanced age, but no model {{has been successful in}} fitting this data and thus providing clues to the underlying biology. In this work we assume these data are reliable and free from bias. We find that a Beta distribution fits SEER age-specific cancer incidence data for all adult cancers extremely well, and its interpretation as a model leads to the possibility that there is a beneficial cancer extinction process that becomes important at elevated age. Particularly evident from the data is the apparent remarkable uniformity of adult cancers peaking in incidence at about the same age, including cancers in other countries. Possible biological mechanisms include increasing apoptosis and cell senescence with age. Further, the model suggests that cancer is not inevitable at advanced age, but reaches a maximum cumulative probability of affliction with any cancer of about 70 % for men and 53 % for women in the US, and much smaller values for individual cancers.

40|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{research efforts}} of the past 40 years {{in the area of}} distribution expansion, a clear definition of the problem, and a truly multistage formulation that addresses practical concerns is yet to be developed. In this paper, the problem is clearly defined and analyzed from a practical point of view. A directed graph minimum edge cost network flow modeling of the problem for a truly multistage formulation using mathematical programming that guarantees global optimality and addresses the noted deficiencies is proposed. The proposed formulation is implemented on small case studies under varying assumptions. Comparative analysis indicates the importance of improved expansion planning.

40|$|Many cancers are {{understood}} to be the product of multiple somatic mutations or other rate-limiting events. <b>Multistage</b> clonal <b>expansion</b> (MSCE) models are a class of continuous-time Markov chain models that capture the multi-hit initiation-promotion-malignant-conversion hypothesis of carcinogenesis. These models have been used broadly to investigate the epidemiology of many cancers, {{assess the impact of}} carcinogen exposures on cancer risk, and evaluate the potential impact of cancer prevention and control strategies on cancer rates. Structural identifiability (the analysis of the maximum parametric information available for a model given perfectly measured data) of certain MSCE models has been previously investigated. However, structural identifiability is a theoretical property and does not address the limitations of real data. In this study, we use pancreatic cancer as a case study to examine the practical identifiability of the two-, three-, and four-stage clonal expansion models given age-specific cancer incidence data using a numerical profile-likelihood approach. We demonstrate that, {{in the case of the}} three- and four-stage models, several parameters that are theoretically structurally identifiable, are, in practice, unidentifiable. This result means that key parameters such as the intermediate cell mutation rates are not individually identifiable from the data and that estimation of those parameters, even if structurally identifiable, will not be stable. We also show that products of these practically unidentifiable parameters are practically identifiable, and, based on this, we propose new reparameterizations of the model hazards that resolve the parameter estimation problems. Our results highlight the importance of identifiability to the interpretation of model parameter estimates...|$|R
40|$|Differences in {{prognosis}} in HPV-positive and HPV-negative oral (oropharyngeal and oral cavity) squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) and increasing incidence of HPV-related cancers have spurred interest in demographic and temporal trends in OSCC incidence. We leverage <b>multistage</b> clonal <b>expansion</b> (MSCE) models coupled with age-period-cohort (APC) epidemiological models to analyze OSCC {{data in the}} SEER cancer registry (1973 - 2012). MSCE models {{are based on the}} initiation-promotion-malignant conversion paradigm in carcinogenesis and allow for interpretation of trends in terms of biological mechanisms. APC models seek to differentiate between the temporal effects of age, period, and birth cohort on cancer risk. Previous studies have looked at the effect of period and cohort on tumor initiation, and we extend this to compare model fits of period and cohort effects on each of tumor initiation, promotion, and malignant conversion rates. HPV-related, HPV-unrelated except oral tongue, and HPV-unrelated oral tongue sites are best described by placing period and cohort effects on the initiation rate. HPV-related and non-oral-tongue HPV-unrelated cancers have similar promotion rates, suggesting similar tumorigenesis dynamics once initiated. Estimates of promotion rates at oral tongue sites are lower, corresponding to a longer sojourn time; {{this finding is consistent with}} the hypothesis of an etiology distinct from HPV or alcohol and tobacco use. Finally, for the three subsite groups, men have higher initiation rates than women of the same race, and black people have higher promotion than white people of the same sex. These differences explain part of the racial and sex differences in OSCC incidence...|$|R
40|$|Artículos en revistasThe {{hydroelectric}} power plant HidroItuango represents a major expansion for the Colombian electrical system (with a total capacity of 2400 MW). This paper analyzes the possible interconnections and investments involved in connecting HidroItuango, in order to strengthen the Colombian national transmission system. A Mixed Binary Linear Programming (MBLP) model was used to solve the <b>Multistage</b> Transmission Network <b>Expansion</b> Planning (MTEP) problem of the Colombian electrical system, taking the N- 1 safety criterion into account. The N- 1 safety criterion indicates that the transmission system must be expanded so that the system will continue to operate properly if an outage in a system element (within a pre-defined set of contingencies) occurs. The use of a MBLP model guaranteed the convergence with existing classical optimization methods and the optimal solution for the MTEP using commercial solvers. Multiple scenarios for generation and demand were used to consider uncertainties within these parameters. The model was implemented using the algebraic modeling language AMPL and solved using the commercial solver CPLEX. The proposed model was then applied to the Colombian electrical system using the planning horizon of 2018 - 2025. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: For {{many years}} {{the authors have}} been {{investigating}} the use of twin screw machines to fulfil both the expansion and compression. One of potential advantages of screw machines over other types of positive displacement machine is their ability to perform both the compression and expansion functions simultaneously, using only one pair of rotors. A further feature {{is the use of}} the rotors which seal on both contacting surfaces so that the same profile may be used both for the expander and the compressor sections. By using the same profile for both, the compressor and expander rotors can be machined or ground in a single cutting operation and then separated by machining a parting slot in them on completion of the lobe formation. Moreover, in such a case, by proper location of the machine ports, pressure loads and thereby, mechanical friction losses will be less than if the two functions are performed in separate machines. Fields of application of such machines are replacement of the throttle valve in refrigeration and air conditioning plants, high-pressure application, fuel cells, <b>multistage</b> compression or <b>expansion</b> and, really, any other application where simultaneous compression and expansion are required. One example of such unusual, but convenient application is the compressor capacity control by partial expanding of compressed gas...|$|R
40|$|The airport {{terminal}} capacity planning problem deals with determining the optimal design and expansion capacities for {{different areas of}} the terminal in the presence of uncertainty with regards to future demand levels and expansion costs. Analytical modeling of passenger flow in {{airport terminal}}s under transient demand patterns is especially difficult due to the complex structure of a terminal. Because of this difficulty, the airport terminal capacity planning problem has not been studied in a holistic fashion, such that studies in this area either do not account for expandability or focus only on one particular area of the terminal. In this study, we consider the airport terminal capacity planning problem as a whole. In this regard, we first derive time functions to approximate maximum delays in passageways and processing stations of an airport terminal. We then use these delay functions to develop a multistage stochastic programming model based on a multicommodity flow network representation of the whole airport terminal. The solution of the model, for which we develop an efficient solution algorithm, provides optimal capacity requirements for each area in an airport terminal during the initial building phase, as well as the optimal expansion policy under stochastic future demand. The results of the study are applicable to all similar queuing networks, including other types of passenger terminals.

40|$|The human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) infects multiple {{sites in the}} human epithelium and is the etiological agent for over 90 % of anogenital cancers and an increasing percentage of oropharyngeal cancers. HPV presents an inherently multiscale problem: disease prevalence is known at the population level, infection and disease progression occur within an individual, and cancer incidence is given again for the population. This dissertation uses several mathematical models (of prevalence, transmission, and the progression to oral cancer) to address HPV at different levels. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, I assess trends in prevalence of cervical HPV and seroprevalence of HPV antibodies using age-period-cohort (APC) epidemiological models that seek to differentiate between the temporal effects of age, period, and birth cohort. Additionally, I consider demographic (age, race) variation in concurrence and type-concordance of genital and oral infections and serum antibodies {{and the impact of}} vaccination on seroprevalence and genital prevalence among women. To study the dynamics of HPV transmission and infection, I develop a multisite transmission model that includes consideration of autoinoculation. Assuming homogeneous contacts, I analyze the basic reproductive number R 0, as well as type and target reproduction numbers, for a two-site model. I find R 0 takes the maximum of certain next generation matrix terms or takes their geometric average in certain limiting cases, and heterogeneity in the same-site terms increases R 0 while heterogeneity in the cross-site terms decreases it. I extend this analysis to a heterosexual population, which yields dynamics analogous to those of vector-host models. Finally, I leverage <b>multistage</b> clonal <b>expansion</b> (MSCE) models of cancer biology coupled with APC models to analyze oral squamous cell carcinoma data in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry. MSCE models are based on the initiation-promotion-malignant conversion paradigm in carcinogenesis. I find that HPV-related, HPV-unrelated, and oral tongue sites are best described by placing period and cohort effects on the initiation rate. Racial differences in estimated biological parameters as well as period and cohort trends are considered. To connect HPV prevalence to incidence of oral cancer, I develop MSCE models that use initiation rates dependent on HPV prevalence...|$|R
