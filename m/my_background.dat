During the initial action, 60 AV-8Bs were deployed on ships such as the [...] and , from which over 1,000 sorties were flown throughout the war. When possible, land-based forward arming and refuelling points were set up to enable prompt operations. USMC commander Lieutenant General Earl B. Hailston said that the Harriers were able to provide 24-hour support for ground forces, and noted that [...] "The airplane... became the envy of pilots even from <b>my</b> <b>background...</b> there's {{an awful lot of}} things on the Harrier that I've found the Hornet pilots asking me ...

500|$|Patrick Stewart {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Jean-Luc Picard after Justman saw him perform at the University of California, Los Angeles. Roddenberry insisted that he wanted a French actor in the role, but Justman {{arranged}} a meeting between Stewart and the production team to introduce the actor, and later Berman supported the casting. Fontana thought that American actor Stephen Macht would be better in the role. Justman wanted Stewart in the show in some capacity, and with Roddenberry still opposing him as Picard, Justman suggested that he might be a good fit instead for Data. Because Roddenberry couldn't find an actor he preferred more for Picard, he relented and changed his concept of Picard to better fit Stewart. Although Stewart was willing to put on an American accent to portray the role of Picard, the producers asked him to use his natural accent instead. They also tested him with a hairpiece but thought that it looked [...] "awful". Stewart was pleased to have received the role, saying that his children were impressed with the new part and praised the mythos of the show saying, [...] "The great strength of Star Trek is its epic, classic feel. For an actor of <b>my</b> <b>background,</b> it has more richness and depth than you might expect on television." ...|$|E

500|$|Niffenegger {{began writing}} the novel in 1997; the last scene, {{in which an}} aged Clare is waiting for Henry, was written first, {{because it is the}} story's focal point. The {{narrative}} was originally structured thematically. Responding to comments from readers of early drafts of the manuscript, Niffenegger reorganized the narrative so that it largely followed Clare's timeline. The work was finished in 2001. With no history of commercial publication, Niffenegger had trouble finding interested literary agents—25 rejected the manuscript. In 2002, she sent it unsolicited to the small, San Francisco-based publisher MacAdam/Cage, where it reached Anika Streitfeld. Streitfeld, who became Niffenegger's editor, [...] "thought it was incredible. Right from the very beginning you feel like you are in capable hands, that this is someone who has a story to tell and who knows how to tell it." [...] She gave it to David Poindexter, the founder of the publishing firm, [...] "who read it overnight and decided to buy the book". However, Niffenegger had acquired an agent by this time, and several publishing houses in New York City were interested in the novel. The manuscript was put up for auction and MacAdam/Cage bid US$100,000, by far the largest sum it had ever offered for a book. Although another publisher outbid them, Niffenegger selected MacAdam/Cage because they were so dedicated to her work. Also, Niffenegger explains that her [...] "own natural inclination is to go small. <b>My</b> <b>background</b> is in punk music—I'd always pick the indie company over the giant corporation." ...|$|E

40|$|<b>My</b> {{academic}} <b>background</b> is in {{the field}} of fisheries science with research interests centred on resource management aspects. My doctoral thesis explored the potential use of catch based empirical indicators for monitoring, assessment and management of data poor fish stocks. I developed a novel method for managing data poor fisheries by adapting process control techniques from the discipline of `Quality Control Engineering'. For my Master's thesis, I investigated the stock structure of various marine fish species along the Indian coast, primarily using landmark based morphometric methods. <b>My</b> research <b>background</b> earned me immense field experience and laboratory skills through ship-based sampling, taxonomic identification, fish stock assessments, stock structure analysis, gut content analysis and reproductive biology of fish species. I have excellent skills in handling large data sets, conducting statistical analysis and modelling biological systems. I am proficient in R programming and teach modelling skills to academicians through my blogs and training programs. I also have developed skills on integrating remotely sensed data with Geographical Information Systems (GIS). In short, <b>my</b> research <b>background</b> has earned me the skills of a marine biologist and mathematical modeller.
