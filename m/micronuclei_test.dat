The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the mutagenicity and genotoxicity in electric fishes of species Eingenmannia virescens, under to benzene exposure (50 ppm), utilizing <b>Micronuclei</b> <b>Test</b> (MNs) and Comet Assay techniques. Ten fish blood samples were collected in different times of exposure:- T-o, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h and 360 h (15 days). To determine the frequency of MNs, 1. 000 cells per microscopical slides were counted. For the Comet Assay analysis four damage classes were defined- I-II-III- lV and for the statistic analysis number values (ranks) from 0 to 3 were assigned for each class. The sum of ranks (values) for all times of exposure was compared to To and these differences were statistically analyzed.

The genotoxic effect of the diesel water-soluble fraction (DWSF) on Hippocampus reidi (Ginsburg, 1933) was assessed. Fish were exposed to three different DWSF dilutions for up to 96 hours, and genotoxicity was analyzed using the <b>micronuclei</b> <b>test</b> and the comet assay. The <b>micronuclei</b> <b>test</b> revealed no significant differences between any of the DWSF dilutions and the control in the 24 -hours period; however, micronuclei increased in fish exposed to 1 : 500 and 1 : 100 DWSF dilutions for 96 hours. For all dilutions, there was an increase in micronuclei in fish exposed for 96 hours when compared to those exposed for 24 hours. The tested dilutions increased frequencies of cell classes 2 (medium damage) and 3 (large damage) in the comet assay after 24 and 96 hours. Fish exposed to DWSF 1 : 100 exhibited a higher frequency of class 4 (apoptosis) cells in the 96 -hours period.

30|$|In a field study, {{micronucleus}} assay {{was shown}} to be applicable to micronucleus-inducing agents in frogs ([Saleh and Zeytinoğlu 2001]). The micronucleus test is simple and successful among many mutagenesis assays, which are both dependent on any karyotypic characteristics and less time consuming ([Heddle et al. 1991]). According to ([Hartwell et al. 2000]) and ([Fagr et al. 2008]), the incidence of micronuclei in fish and other aquatic life serves as an index {{of these types of}} damage, and counting of micronuclei is much faster and less technically demanding than scoring of chromosomal aberrations. The comet assay has been considered as a sensitive, rapid, and reliable method of quantitatively measuring DNA damage in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells ([Bajpayee et al. 2005]). It is increasingly being used in testing of substances such as industrial chemicals, biocides, agrochemical, food additives, and pharmaceuticals for genotoxicity testing ([Brendler-Schwaab et al. 2005]). Thus, for these reasons, comet assay and <b>micronuclei</b> <b>test</b> in fish erythrocyte seem to be promising tests in environmental genotoxicity and mutagenesis investigations.

In the assessment using the Ames test, 2 HMC did not increase the number of His+ revertants in Salmonella typhimurium strains, demonstrating lack of mutagenicity. 2 HMC showed no significant increase in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocyte frequency (MNPCE) in the <b>micronucleus</b> <b>test,</b> or in DNA strand breaks using the comet assay, evidencing absence of genotoxicity. Regarding cytotoxicity, 2 HMC exhibited moderate cytotoxicity in mouse bone marrow cells by <b>micronucleus</b> <b>test.</b> 2 HMC showed antimutagenic action in co-administration with the positive controls, sodium azide (SA) and 4 -nitroquinoline- 1 -oxide (4 NQO), in the Ames test.

When CHO-K 1 cells were pretreated by adding 0. 01, 0. 05 or 0. 1 mL of extract per mL of cell culture medium 24 or 48 h before bleomycin or cyclophosphamide there was a protective effect against chromosome breaks and {{a significant decrease in}} the mitotic index (a measure of cytotoxicity) of the CHO-K 1 cells. The extract also had a protective effect against oxidative hydroxyl radical damage to 2 -DR. This study suggests that C. brasiliense pulp aqueous extract has anticlastogenic potential, possibly due to its antioxidative properties...|$|E
40|$|Sea {{cucumber}} (Stichopus horrens) {{protein hydrolysates}} {{were known as}} a potential functional food source with angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory. The genotoxicity properties of S. horrens protein hydrolysates have been investigated through two different in vitro tests: Ames test and in vitro <b>micronucleus</b> <b>test</b> while the cytotoxicity properties of S. horrens protein hydrolysate were assessed using neutral red test. The study was conducted at a concentration up to 8000 μg/ml, 80 μg/ml and 50 μg/ml for Ames <b>test,</b> in vitro <b>micronucleus</b> <b>test</b> and neutral red test respectively with and without metabolic activation. There were no increments {{in the number of}} revertant colonies observed at any concentrations of S. horrens protein hydrolysates with and without metabolic activation in all four strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535 and TA 1537) compared to the solvent control. In in vitro <b>micronucleus</b> <b>test,</b> S. horrens protein hydrolysate did not induce clastogenicity in V 79 cell while in neutral red test, S. horrens protein hydrolysate did not show any cytotoxic effects on NIH/ 3 T 3 mouse fibroblast cell. In conclusion, S. horrens protein hydrolysates are safe in terms of genotoxic and cytotoxic hence have the potential to be used in pharmaceutical and food industries as functional ingredient...|$|R

Includes bibliographical references (page 62 - 71). Chromosomal aberration is an important biomarker for carcinogenesis. The study of DNA damage at the chromosomal level {{is an essential part}} of genetic toxicology. Different Chromium compounds are used in tanneries. Hexavalent chromium, Cr (VI) is considered as a human lung carcinogen with potentially widespread exposure. This study was designed specifically to evaluate cytogenotoxicity of chromium compounds used in leather industries on human peripheral blood lymphocytes by using a series of cytogenotoxic assays such as <b>micronucleus</b> <b>test,</b> chromosome aberration test and alkaline Comet assay. These tests are proved to be extremely useful techniques in cytogenotoxicity measurements. The <b>micronucleus</b> <b>test</b> assesses chromosomal damage by the formation of micronucleus on once-divided binucleatetd cells, whereas various types of structural chromosome aberrations and extent of DNA damage are detected by chromosome aberration and comet assay respectively. Different types of structural damages like Break, Gap and dicentric chromosomes were detected by Chromosome aberration <b>test.</b> <b>Micronucleus</b> <b>test</b> also revealed significant chromosomal damage in chromium exposed human blood cells. In line with results of <b>Micronucleus</b> <b>test</b> and Chromosome aberration test, significant DNA damage was also detected by Comet assay. The results of Comet assay indicate that chromium compounds induced significant increase in the comet tail DNA (%), tail moment and Olive tail moment; the parameters used to determine genotoxicity. These results from all three tests provide evidence that exposure to chromium and chromium compounds in human peripheral lymphocytes results in induction of DNA damage. Therefore the present study gives an indication of an association between chromium induced DNA damage and chromosomal instability. Mohammad Habibur RahmanM. Biotechnolog...|$|R
