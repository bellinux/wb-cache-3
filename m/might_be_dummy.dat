How else do they organize highways, build elaborate nests and stage epic raids? But, as it turns out, "[a]nts aren't smart. Ant colonies are. A colony can solve problems unthinkable for individual ants, such as finding the shortest path to the best food source, allocating workers to different tasks, or defending a territory from neighbors. As individuals, ants <b>might</b> <b>be</b> tiny <b>dummies,</b> but as colonies they respond quickly and effectively to their environment. They do it with something called swarm intelligence. ...|$|R
