50|$|He is {{best known}} his work on <b>magneto</b> <b>generators,</b> {{particularly}} those used for arc lighting and lighthouses. Similar <b>magneto</b> <b>generators</b> had been produced earlier by Nollet; de Méritens' innovation was to replace the rotor coils previously wound on individual bobbins, with a 'ring wound' armature. These windings were wound on a segmented iron core, similar to a Gramme ring, so as to form a single continuous hoop. This gave a more even output current, which was advantageous for use with arc lamps.|$|R
50|$|The de Méritens <b>magneto</b> <b>generator</b> {{illustrated}} {{shows the}} 'ring wound' armature. As {{there is now}} only a single rotor disk, each horseshoe magnet comprises a stack of individual magnets, but acts through a pair of pole pieces.|$|R

50|$|Firing the gap of a spark plug, {{particularly}} in the combustion chamber of a high-compression engine, requires a greater voltage (or higher tension) than {{can be achieved by}} a simple magneto. The high-tension magneto combines an alternating current <b>magneto</b> <b>generator</b> and a transformer. A high current at low voltage is generated by the magneto, then transformed to a high voltage (even though this is now a far smaller current) by the transformer.|$|R
5000|$|... de Méritens is {{best remembered}} today for his {{production}} of <b>magneto</b> <b>generators</b> specifically for lighthouses. These were favoured for their simplicity and reliability, in particular their avoidance of commutators. In the sea {{air of a}} lighthouse, the commutator {{that had been used}} previously with dynamo generators was a continual source of trouble. The lighthouse keepers of the time, usually semi-retired sailors, were not mechanically or electrically skilled to maintain these more complex machines.|$|R

50|$|To {{achieve an}} {{adequate}} output power, <b>magneto</b> <b>generators</b> used many more poles; usually sixteen, from eight horseshoe magnets {{arranged in a}} ring. As the flux available was limited by the magnet metallurgy, the only option was to increase the field by using more magnets. As this was still an inadequate power, extra rotor disks were stacked axially, along the axle. This had the advantage that each rotor disk could at least share the flux of two expensive magnets. The machine illustrated here uses eight disks and nine rows of magnets: 72 magnets in all.|$|R

5000|$|Ringdown {{is used in}} manual operation, as {{distinguished}} from automatic signaling by dialing a number. The signal consists of a continuous or pulsed alternating current (AC) signal transmitted over the line. It may be used {{with or without a}} telephone switchboard. The term originated in magneto telephone signaling in which cranking the <b>magneto</b> <b>generator,</b> either integrated into the telephone set or housed in a connected ringer box, would not only ring its bell but also cause a drop to fall down at the telephone exchange switchboard, marked with the number of the line to which the magneto telephone instrument was connected.|$|R
50|$|Electric bells are {{typically}} designed {{to operate on}} low voltages of from 10 to 24 V AC or DC. Before widespread distribution of electric power, bells were necessarily powered by batteries, either wet-cell or dry-cell type. Bells used in early telephone systems derived current by a <b>magneto</b> <b>generator</b> cranked by the subscriber. In residential applications, a small bell-ringing transformer is usually used to power the doorbell circuit. So that bell circuits {{can be made with}} low-cost wiring methods, bell signal circuits are limited in voltage and power rating. Bells for industrial purposes may operate on other, higher, AC or DC voltages to match plant voltages or available standby battery systems.|$|R

50|$|During {{the early}} days of telephones, in the UK, a variety of {{instruments}} were produced, in low volume, often combining new and emerging technologies with the traditional skills of the wood joiner and cabinetmaker. They were simply known as Type 1, 2, 3 etc. These were often used on simple, internal links, sometimes taking the place of the 'speaking tube' in large houses. These instrument had no dials, and signalling consisted of a hand-cranked <b>magneto</b> <b>generator.</b> Often the bell at the other end would just be 'tinkled' by simply rattling the switch hooks up and down.From these developed the first, serious, GPO instruments, the 100 series. This comprised a wall phone, the Tele. 121 and a desk phone, the Tele 150.|$|R
50|$|An early {{example of}} regular use of human-powered {{electrical}} equipment is in early telephone systems; current {{to ring the}} remote bell was provided by a subscriber cranking {{a handle on the}} telephone, which turned a small <b>magneto</b> <b>generator.</b> Human-powered devices are useful as emergency equipment, when natural disaster, war, or civil disturbance make regular power supplies unavailable. They have also been seen as economical for use in poor countries, where batteries may be expensive and mains power unreliable or unavailable. They are also an environmentally preferable alternative to the use of disposable batteries, which are wasteful source of energy and may introduce heavy metals into the environment. Communications is a common application for the relatively small amount of electric power that can be generated by a human turning a generator.|$|R

Located in the engine-house, each Brown was driving a pair of generators and an air-pump to feed the pressure tank of a foghorn.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method to calculate stray capacitance between conductor wire filaments. The new proposed method is called vespiary regular hexagonal (VRH) model. In this paper conductor of <b>magneto</b> cumulative <b>generator</b> (MCG) coil has a multilayer wire. So the proposed model {{is used to}} calculate stray capacitance between two adjacent wire filaments (WFs) and capacitance between the wire filaments and central cylindrical liner in one turn of coil (OTC). The presented method in this paper is based on an analytical method and geometrical structure. In one turn of coil, the wire filaments in VRH method are separated into many very small similar elementary cells. In this structure, an equilateral lozenge-shape basic cell (ELBC) with two trapezium-shape regions has been considered between two adjacent wire filaments. This method is applied to calculate the total stray capacitance of N-turns of coil (NTC) with multi WFs in round cross-section. Simulation results show that the proposed method is very useful for designing a geometrical structure of the MCG coil...|$|R
50|$|Henry Wilde, an {{electrical}} engineer from Manchester, England, developed a combination of <b>magneto</b> and electro-magnet <b>generator,</b> where the <b>magneto</b> was used only to supply the field to the larger alternator. These are illustrated in Rankin Kennedy's work Electrical Installations Kennedy himself developed a simpler version of this, intended for lighting use on ships, where a dynamo and magneto were assembled on the same shaft. Kennedy's innovation here was to avoid the need for brushgear altogether. The current generated in the magneto is transmitted by wires attached to the rotating shaft to the dynamo's rotating field coil. The output of the dynamo is then taken from the stator coils. This is 'inside-out' compared to the conventional dynamo, but avoids the need for brushgear.|$|R
50|$|In early {{telephone}} systems, connections {{were made}} in the central office by switchboard operators using patch cords to connect one party to another. A telephone call was initiated by operating a <b>magneto</b> hand <b>generator,</b> usually integral to the customer telephone, to alert the central office operator by the ringing of a switchboard bell or the activation of a drop. In response, the operator inserted a patch cord into the corresponding line jack and assisted the customer by voice. The other end of the patch cord connected the caller to the destination telephone line. If the destination party belonged to another exchange, the operator established a connection to that exchange where another operator completed the call setup. As technology advanced, automatic electro-mechanical switches were introduced and telephones were equipped initially with rotary dials for pulse-dialing and then Touch-Tone key pads in the 1960s, which increased the speed of dialing and enabled other vertical telephone features. For telephone subscribers, prior to widespread use of area codes and the 10 digit phone number, the first 3 digits of the 7 digit telephone number were called the exchange, which used the first two letters of the exchange name and one digit, e.g., GLadstone 7 (an exchange in the Chicago area), which was 457 with all numeric representation of telephone numbers. Subscribers needed only 7 digits to make calls within their area.|$|R

Liquid metal heat transfer is of considerable interest because of the high heat transfer rates that can be achieved due to their high thermal conductivity compared to other fluids. Unlike the typical cooling fluids, i. e., water; liquid metals have the advantage of being liquid even at high temperatures without phase transition to gas phase, allowing more compact heat exchanger design. Some of the applications where liquid metals can be used as coolants are liquid-metal-fuel reactors, electromagnetic pumps and flow meters, equipment for the electrolytic removal of gases from liquid metals, and liquid-metal <b>magneto</b> hydrodynamic power <b>generators.</b> Three-dimensional CFD simulations have been carried out to investigate the fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics of various liquid metal coolants in a flow passage. A computational methodology for a circular flow passage but with different flow configurations i. e., (internal and external flows) has been implemented in ANSYS CFX. All the simulations have been performed for the Reynolds numbers ranging from 104 to 105, by assuming flow passage to be at constant wall temperature. Numerical results for the flow velocities, temperatures, heat transfer rates and pressure drops have been presented graphically as functions of significant parameters. The results include the comparison of pressure drop, convective heat transfer characteristics, and thermal and hydrodynamic entry lengths for various liquid metals, which apply both in the entrance as well as fully developed region. Validation of the computational model is achieved via comparison with existing experimental correlations. Reasonable agreement has been found between the simulations and the experimental data...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe co-doped {{lanthanum}} chromite {{system of}} (La 0. 8 Ca 0. 2) (Cr 0. 81 Co 0. 1 Cu 0. 09) O 3 sample has been prepared by high temperature solid state reaction technique. The synthesized sample {{has been characterized}} for structural, optical, morphological and magnetic properties by powder XRD, UV-vis, SEM/EDS and VSM. Structural analysis revealed that the prepared sample has orthorhombic structure with space group of Pnma. The bonding between the atoms has been analyzed using maximum entropy method (MEM). The bond lengths and mid bond electron densities have been estimated from the 1 D electron density profiles. From the optical absorption spectra, the energy band gap of the sample has been calculated as 2. 035 eV. From the SEM image, the average particle size of the synthesized sample is 235 nm. EDS spectrum of the synthesized sample confirms its purity. Room temperature M-H curves obtained from VSM measurements exhibit predominant antiferromagnetic ordering of the prepared sample. The co-doped LaCrO 3 compounds have been primarily used as cathode as well as inter-connector coating materials in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC). Introduction. Lanthanum chromite (LaCrO 3), a perovskite rare-earth oxide material has been investigated {{for the past five}} decades due to their rich and interesting properties and essential technological applications. Since lanthanum chromite has high melting point of 2490 °C with high electronic conductivity, it is often used as electrodes in <b>magneto</b> hydrodynamic (MHD) <b>generators</b> [1] and has also been found for use as oxidation catalyst for soot combustion [2], electric heaters [3] and NOx sensors [4]. Lanthanum chromite is a p-type semiconducting material which exhibits properties like, good physical and chemical stability during the oxidation and reduction process, electro catalytic activity, high thermal expansion coefficient and high mechanical strength [5, 6]. Since the transition metal doped lanthanum chromite has the property of mixed ionic and electronic conductivity, they have been used for electrodes and interconnector materials in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) which is a solid electro chemical device, converts chemical energy into electrical energy [7]. Usually, LaCrO 3 crystallizes in orthorhombic structure with Pnma space group. The transport properties of lanthanum chromites can be studied by the localized behaviour of the d-electrons [8]. Literature showed various preparation techniques to synthesis lanthanum chromites which include sol-gel method, hydrothermal processing, microwave combustion synthesis, pechini method etc. In the present work, (Co, Cu) doped La-Ca based chromites were prepared through solid state reaction method and we report on structural, optical, morphological and magnetic properties of the synthesized co-doped system...|$|R
