5|$|In January 2015, Florida State University's Center for Advanced Power Systems has {{unveiled}} a new 24,000-volt direct current power test system, {{the most powerful}} of its kind available at a university research center throughout the world. The new test facility is the latest piece of the center's PHIL testing program. It has a 24,000-volt direct current with a capacity of 5 megawatts, making it the most powerful PHIL system of its kind at a university research center worldwide. To create the new system, the center put together four individual 6 kilovolt, 1.25 megawatt converters that can be arranged in any combination, in series or parallel connection, to form an extremely flexible test bed for <b>medium</b> <b>voltage</b> direct current (MVDC) system investigations.|$|E

50|$|As {{operating}} voltages increase, greater consideration must {{be given}} to such design principles. At <b>medium</b> <b>voltages,</b> one of the two horns may be omitted as the horn-to-horn gap can otherwise be small enough to be bridged by an alighting bird. Alternatively, duplex gaps consisting of two sections {{on opposite sides of the}} insulator can be fitted. Low voltage distribution systems, in which the risk of arcing is much lower, may not use arcing horns at all.|$|R
50|$|It is {{desirable}} that the reactor {{does not go}} into magnetic saturation during a short-circuit, so generally an air-core coil is used. At low and <b>medium</b> <b>voltages,</b> air-insulated coils are practical; for high transmission voltages, the coils may be immersed in transformer oil. Installation of air-core coils requires consideration of the magnetic field produced by the coils, which may induce current in large nearby metal objects. This may result in objectionable temperature rise and waste of energy.|$|R
25|$|Currently, {{there are}} cross-subsidies in the tariff structure. <b>Medium</b> <b>voltage</b> {{consumers}} pay higher tariffs that serve to subsidize lower tariffs for low voltage consumers. Users that consume less than 150 kWh per month receive transfers {{from the rest}} of the consumers. The lowest-consumption users (0-50kWh/month) benefit from reductions between 45% and 63% in their average tariff. Consumers above the 50kWh limit also benefit from the subsidy scheme to a smaller extent.|$|E
25|$|In general, a {{distance}} of 7D (7 × Rotor Diameter of the Wind Turbine) is set between each turbine in a fully developed wind farm, but micrositing optimizes placement, particularly in hilly areas. Individual turbines are interconnected with a <b>medium</b> <b>voltage</b> (usually 34.5 kV) power collection system and communications network. At a substation, this medium-voltage electric current is increased in voltage with a transformer for connection to the high voltage transmission system. Construction of a land-based wind farm requires installation of the collector system and substation, and possibly access roads to each turbine site.|$|E
