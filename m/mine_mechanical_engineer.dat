50|$|In June 1874 the Duke of Sutherland entertained {{a visiting}} party of <b>mining</b> and <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineers</b> at Dunrobin, and then {{conveyed}} {{them in his}} personal train over the line. They visited the reopened coal mine at Brora and continued to Georgemas. On 9 July 1874 he personally drove his train into Wick station, the rails having just been completed. The Provost and some civic colleagues turned out to meet him, but the encounter was somewhat restrained, Wick’s sceptical attitude to the line being still in evidence. Sutherland went on to Thurso, where a crowd of 3,000 persons, two bands, and a banquet awaited him.|$|R

Nor did it specifically and clearly give the government Mining Engineer powers to introduce a legal colour bar. But under section 4(n) it gave the Governor-General powers to grant, cancel and suspend certificates of competency to mine managers, mine overseers, <b>mine</b> surveyors, <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineers,</b> engine-drivers and miners entitled to blast. It also gave him the power to decide which other occupations should be required to possess certificates of competency.|$|R
5000|$|Alongside {{the opening}} of the College of Physical Science, Boyd’s {{presidency}} was also recognised for his involvement in {{the opening of}} the Nicholas Wood Memorial Hall. The hall was erected in 1870, by public subscription, as a memorial to Nicholas Wood, the first President of the North of England Institute of Mining and <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Engineers,</b> after his death in December 1865. It was opened in July 1872 by the then President of the Mining Institute, Edward Fenwick Boyd, The Very Rev. the Dean of the Durham, the Mayor of Newcastle and numerous members of the town council. [...] It was erected primarily for the accommodation {{of the members of the}} coal trade as well as <b>mining</b> and <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Engineers</b> of the North of England and it has been the home of the Mining Institute ever since. [...] It was designed and built in the height of the Gothic revival by architect A.M. Dunn and it contains a large marble statue of a seated Nicholas Wood, created by Mr Wyon, overlooking the library. Today it continues to be of educational importance. It houses numerous documents, transactions, maps and books stemming from its origins in 1852. The addition of the lecture theatre in 1902 expanded this educational element and is used to host speakers and lectures based on numerous elements related to the mining industry ranging from ‘Migrant Miners’ to ‘Colliers Viewers, Engineers and the Making of the Modern World’.|$|R
50|$|The North of England Institute of Mining and <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Engineers</b> (NEIMME), {{commonly}} known as The Mining Institute, is a British organisation dedicated to the research and preservation of knowledge relating to <b>mining</b> and <b>mechanical</b> engineering. Founded in 1852, the institute, in Newcastle upon Tyne, possesses {{one of the largest}} collections of such mining information in the world. Its library, named after the first President Nicholas Wood contains more than twenty thousand volumes of technical literature, in the fields of <b>mining,</b> geology, <b>mechanical</b> engineering, government blue books, mine rescue, mineralogy, mineral chemistry, mining statistics, mining law, seismology and other related topics.|$|R
