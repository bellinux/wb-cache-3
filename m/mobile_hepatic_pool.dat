40|$|A {{new method}} for the direct {{measurement}} in vivo of the synthetic rate of bilirubin from hepatic hemes is proposed. This method {{depends on the}} application of the labeled precursor-product relationship to the <b>hepatic</b> <b>pool</b> of porphobilinogen, which is a common precursor of both urinary porphobilinogen and hepatic-synthesized bilirubin. The <b>hepatic</b> <b>pool</b> of porphobilinogen is labeled by means of an intravenous injection of δ-aminolevulinic acid- 4 - 14 C. The proportion of total bilirubin production which is derived from hepatic hemes is calculated from the ratio of the mean 14 C specific activities of stercobilin and porphobilinogen estimated in pooled specimens of feces and urine, respectively. The method can be most readily applied to patients with acute intermittent porphyria, as the appreciable quantities of prophobilinogen in the urine of these patients greatly facilitate the measurement of porphobilinogen- 14 C specific activity. In three patients with acute intermittent porphyria, values obtained for the synthetic rate of bilirubin from hepatic hemes were 20. 7, 15. 8, and 13. 3 % of total bilirubin production...|$|R

Ornithine can be (1) utilized as a component of the urea cycle, (2) decarboxylated to form putrescine, a precursor of the polyamines, spermidine and spermine, and (3) converted metabolically to arginine, proline and glutamate. In prior investigations conducted in our laboratories and others, free endogenous <b>hepatic</b> <b>pools</b> of ornithine were found to be elevated following hydrazine administration. Consequently, time-course alterations of arginase, ornithine δ-transaminase, ornithine transcarbamylase, and ornithine decarboxylase activities were investigated regarding the effect of hydrazine treatment on hepatic ornithine metabolism in the rat. As an outgrowth of these investigations, a time-course study of the hepatic concentration of putrescine, spermidine and spermine was warranted. Male albino rats (Holtzman) were injected with neutralized hydrazine (40 mg/kg, body weight, ip) or isotonic saline (1. 0 ml/kg, body weight, ip) and fasted for various times.

By studying bile fistula subjects, using several types of isotopic preparations, simultaneous labeling of separate cholesterol pools and sampling all components of blood and bile at frequent intervals, we developed a comprehensive multicompartmental model for cholesterol within the rapidly miscible pool. Data in six components (bile acids, esterified cholesterol in whole plasma, and free cholesterol in blood cells, bile, alpha lipoproteins, and beta lipoproteins) were modeled simultaneously with the SAAM program. The analysis revealed extensive exchange of free cholesterol between HDL and liver, blood cells, and other tissues. There was net free cholesterol transport from HDL to the liver in most subjects. The major organ that removed esterified cholesterol from blood was the liver. A large portion (4, 211 mumol) of total hepatic cholesterol comprised a pool that turned over rapidly (t 1 / 2 of 72 min) by exchanging mainly with plasma HDL and was {{the major source of}} bile acids and biliary cholesterol. Only 6 % of hepatic newly synthesized cholesterol was used directly for bile acid synthesis: the analysis showed that 94 % of newly synthesized cholesterol was partitioned into the large <b>hepatic</b> <b>pool</b> (putative plasma membrane free cholesterol) which exchanged rapidly with plasma lipoproteins. Bile acid synthetic rate correlated directly with the size of the large <b>hepatic</b> <b>pool.</b> In conclusion, <b>hepatic</b> and blood cholesterol pools and transports have been quantitated.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the acid-soluble carnitine and coenzyme A pools was studied in fed and 24 -h-starved rats after carnitine administration. Carnitine given by intravenous injection at a dose of 60 μmol/ 100 g body wt. was integrated into the animal's endogenous carnitine pool. Large amounts of acylcarnitines appeared in the plasma and liver within 5 min of carnitine injection. Differences in acid-soluble acylcarnitine concentrations were observed between fed and starved rats after injection and reflected the acylcarnitine/carnitine relationship seen in the endogenous carnitine pool of the two metabolic states. Thus, a larger acylcarnitine production was seen in starved animals and indicated a greater source of accessible acyl-CoA molecules. In addition {{to changes in the}} amount of acylcarnitines present, the specific acyl groups present also varied between groups of animals. Acetylcarnitine made up 37 and 53 % of liver acid-soluble acylcarnitines in uninjected fed and starved animals respectively. At 5 min after carnitine injection hepatic acid-soluble acylcarnitines were 41 and 73 % in the form of acetylcarnitine in fed and starved rats respectively. Despite these large changes in carnitine and acylcarnitines, no changes were observed in plasma non-esterified fatty acid or β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations in either fed or starved rats. Additionally, measurement of acetyl-CoA, coenzyme A, total acid-soluble CoA and acid-insoluble CoA demonstrated that the <b>hepatic</b> CoA <b>pool</b> was resistant to carnitine-induced changes. This lack of change in the <b>hepatic</b> CoA <b>pool</b> or ketone-body production while acyl groups are shunted from acyl-CoA molecules to acylcarnitines suggests a low flux through the carnitine pool compared with the CoA pool.

Serine-synthesizing activity was found to be distributed in various rat tissues such as kidney, brain, testis, spleen, pancreas, and fat pad.

In the liver, the three enzymes of the phosphorylated pathway were found to be repressed by high-protein diets or by starvation and induced by low-protein diets.

Apo E-deficient mice were fed an atherogenic diet containing 40 or 400 mg/kg of alpha-tocopherol acetate for 6 weeks. Total cholesterol in serum and liver and 3 -OH-alpha-sterols in feces, and fecal excretion of bile acids were determined and histological analyses of aortic lesion were performed. A vitamin E-rich diet did not affect body weight, food intake or serum cholesterol. Serum and hepatic concentrations of cholesterol as well as sterol concentration in feces were similar in both groups.

40|$|As {{previously}} demonstrated, chronic {{administration of}} phenobarbital (0. 05 % in the drinking water) and of nafenopin (0. 1 % in the diet) increases the incidence and the kinetics of appearance of liver cancers. If bile acids {{play a key}} role in liver carcinogenesis, it might thus be expected that treatments like phenobarbital or nafenopin, which positively modulate that process, also modify their <b>hepatic</b> <b>pool.</b> The aim of the present study was to analyze the modifications of the liver bile acid pool during the modulation of liver carcinogenesis by phenobarbital and nafenopin. The animals were submitted to the hepatocarcinogenic initiation-selection (IS) procedure adapted from Solt and Farber. As compared to basal diet, the chronic feeding of phenobarbital significantly increased the total concentrations of liver bile acids both at weeks 9 and 17. That increase was mainly due to a change in the concentration of beta-muricholic acid and hyodeoxycholic acid and, to a lesser extent, of chenodeoxycholic acid and alpha-muricholic acid. In contrast, feeding a diet containing nafenopin led to a significant decrease in the concentration of liver bile acids, due to a complete disappearance of chenodeoxycholic acid and muricholic acid, and a decrease in the concentration of hyodeoxycholic acid. Carcinomas appearing in IS phenobarbital-treated rats contain fewer bile acids than the surrounding parenchyma (because of the decrease in deoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid) whereas the malignant tumors appearing in IS nafenopin-treated rats have essentially the same pattern of bile acids as the surrounding parenchyma.

40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cholestasis is a liver {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} impaired bile flow, reduction of bile acids (BAs) in the intestine, {{and retention of}} BAs in the liver. The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is the transcriptional regulator of BA homeostasis. Activation of FXR by BAs reduces circulating BA levels in a feedback mechanism, repressing hepatic cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase (Cyp 7 a 1), the rate-limiting enzyme for the conversion of cholesterol to BAs. This mechanism involves the hepatic nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner and the intestinal fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 19 and 15. We investigated the role of activation of intestine-specific FXR in reducing hepatic levels of BAs and protecting the liver from cholestasis in mice. METHODS: We generated transgenic mice that express a constitutively active FXR in the intestine. Using FXR gain- and loss-of-function models, we studied the roles of intestinal FXR in mice with intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholestasis. RESULTS: Selective activation of intestinal FXR induced FGF 15 and repressed hepatic Cyp 7 a 1, reducing the pool size of BAs and changing the BA pool composition. Activation of intestinal FXR protected mice from obstructive extrahepatic cholestasis after bile duct ligation or administration of α-naphthylisothiocyanate. In Mdr 2 (-/-) mice, transgenic expression of activated FXR in the intestine protected against liver damage, whereas absence of FXR promoted progression of liver disease. CONCLUSIONS: Activation of FXR transcription in the intestine protects the liver from cholestasis in mice by inducing FGF 15 expression and reducing the <b>hepatic</b> <b>pool</b> of BA; this approach might be developed to reverse cholestasis in patient...|$|R
40|$|A {{mouse model}} of {{chylomicron}} deficiency was recently developed; these mice express a human apolipoprotein (apo) B transgene {{in the liver}} but do not synthesize any apoB in the intestine. Despite severe intestinal fat malabsorption, the mice maintain normal concentrations of plasma lipids and liver-derived apoB 100 -containing lipoproteins. We investigated the metabolic mechanisms by which plasma lipid levels are kept normal. De novo lipogenesis (DNL) and cholesterogenesis were measured by mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA). Plasma non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) fluxes and hepatic re-esterification of labelled plasma NEFA were also measured. Hepatic and plasma triacylglycerol (TG) concentrations and plasma NEFA fluxes were not different between chylomicron-deficient mice and controls. The contribution from DNL to the <b>hepatic</b> TG <b>pool</b> was only modestly higher in chylomicron-deficient mice [12 +/- 2. 1 % (n= 7) compared with 3. 7 +/- 1. 0 % (n= 9); means+/-S. E.

Accordingly, 73 % of hepatic TG was neither from DNL nor from plasma NEFA in controls, presumably reflecting prior contribution from chylomicron remnants, compared with only 26 % in the chylomicron-deficient group. The long-term contribution from DNL to adipose fat stores reached approximately the same steady-state values (approximately 30 %) in the two groups. Body fat accumulation was much lower in chylomicron-deficient animals; thus, whole-body absolute DNL was significantly lower. We conclude that plasma and <b>hepatic</b> TG <b>pools</b> and <b>hepatic</b> secretion of apoB-containing particles are maintained at normal levels in chylomicron-deficient mice, not by de novo fatty acid synthesis, but by more avid re-esterification of plasma NEFA, replacing the normally predominant contribution from chylomicrons, and that some dietary fat can be absorbed by apoB-independent mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Hepatic microsomal {{cytochrome}} P- 450 {{has previously}} been postulated {{to be an important}} factor in determining the rates of hepatic haem biosynthesis and biodegradation. The basis for this proposal is that the haem moiety of cytochrome P- 450 appears to be in equilibrium between binding to apocytochrome P- 450 and existing in some form in the central <b>hepatic</b> <b>pool</b> of haem concerned with the regulation of the haem metabolic pathways. Consequently, any change in the levels of hepatic cytochrome P- 450 would be anticipated to affect the pathways of hepatic haem biosynthesis and biodegradation. At the onset of this project, relatively few chemical agents were known to destroy cytochrome P- 450 (either by degradation of the haem moiety of, or dissociation of the haem moiety from hepatic microsomal cytochrome P- 450) and to affect hepatic haem biosynthesis and/or haem biodegradation (e. g. AIA, Cs₂ and various metals). We thus attempted to further establish the relationship between the ability of compounds to affect hepatic cytochrome P- 450 and to affect hepatic haem metabolism in vivo, using the three anaesthetic agents, fluroxene, halothane and trichloroethylene. During the preparation of this thesis, several other chemicals have been found which destroy cytochrome P- 450 and affect hepatic haem metabolism (e. g. norethisterone, morphine). In addition to the above, it has been attempted to clarify the roles of the degradation of different forms of cytochrome P- 450 and of the different mechanisms of destruction of cytochrome P- 450 in the control of hepatic haem metabolism. The three anaesthetic agents, fluroxene, halothane and trichloroethylene were chosen for study since they destroy cytochrome P- 450 by apparently different mechanisms. Both fluroxene and trichloroethylene specifically degrade the haem moiety of different forms of cytochrome P- 450, but fluroxene converts the haem moiety of cytochrome P- 450 to an N-substituted porphyrin, while TCE apparently degrades the haem into uncoloured products. In contrast, halothane appears to degrade the haem of cytochrome P- 450 to uncoloured products as well as to facilitate the dissociation of haem from intact cytochrome P- 450...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Propionic acidaemia (PA) {{results from}} {{deficiency}} of Propionyl CoA carboxylase, the commonest form presenting in the neonatal period. Despite best current management, PA {{is associated with}} severe neurological sequelae, in particular movement disorders resulting from basal ganglia infarction, although the pathogenesis remains poorly understood. The role of liver transplantation remains controversial but may confer some neuro-protection. The present study utilises quantitative magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to investigate brain metabolite alterations in propionic acidaemia during metabolic stability and acute encephalopathic episodes. Methods Quantitative MRS {{was used to evaluate}} brain metabolites in eight children with neonatal onset propionic acidaemia, with six elective studies acquired during metabolic stability and five studies during acute encephalopathic episodes. MRS studies were acquired concurrently with clinically indicated MR imaging studies at 1. 5 Tesla. LCModel software was used to provide metabolite quantification. Comparison was made with a dataset of MRS metabolite concentrations from a cohort of children with normal appearing MR imaging. Results MRI findings confirm the vulnerability of basal ganglia to infarction during acute encephalopathy. We identified statistically significant decreases in basal ganglia glutamate+glutamine and N-Acetylaspartate, and increase in lactate, during encephalopathic episodes. In white matter lactate was significantly elevated but other metabolites not significantly altered. Metabolite data from two children who had received liver transplantation were not significantly different from the comparator group. Conclusions The metabolite alterations seen in propionic acidaemia in the basal ganglia during acute encephalopathy reflect loss of viable neurons, and a switch to anaerobic respiration. The decrease in glutamine + glutamate supports the hypothesis that they are consumed to replenish a compromised Krebs cycle and that this is a marker of compromised aerobic respiration within brain tissue. Thus {{there is a need for}} improved brain protective strategies during acute metabolic decompensations. MRS provides a non-invasive tool for which could be employed to evaluate novel treatments aimed at restoring basal ganglia homeostasis. The results from the liver transplantation sub-group supports the hypothesis that liver transplantation provides systemic metabolic stability by providing a <b>hepatic</b> <b>pool</b> of functional propionyl CoA carboxylase, thus preventing further acute decompensations which are associated with the risk of brain infarction. </p...|$|R

This suggests that dietary 18 : 3 n- 3 may regulate GSH metabolism and thus mitigate the deleterious effects of PPAR alpha deficiency on redox status, without direct PPAR alpha activation...|$|R
40|$|Hemangioma is {{the most}} common benign tumor of the liver, with a {{prevalence}} estimated as high as 7 %. Tc- 99 m red blood cell (RBC) <b>hepatic</b> blood <b>pool</b> scan with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging is extremely useful for the confirmation or exclusion of hepatic hemangiomas. The classic finding of absent or decreased perfusion and increased blood pooling ("perfusion/blood pool mismatch") is the key diagnostic element in the diagnosis of hemangiomas. The combination of early arterial flow and delayed blood pooling ("perfusion/blood pool match") is shown uncommonly. In giant hemangioma, filling with radioactivity appears first in the periphery, with progressive central fill-in on sequential RBC blood pool scan. However, the reverse filling pattern, which begins first in the center with progressive peripheral filling, is also rarely seen. Studies with false-positive blood pooling have been reported infrequently in nonhemangiomas, including hemangiosarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic adenoma, and metastatic carcinomas (adenocarcinoma of the colon, small cell carcinoma of the lung, neruroendocrine carcinoma). False-negative results have been also reported rarely excep...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the effects of diets {{supplemented}} with egg yolks of modified composition on the fatty-acid composition and lipid content in rat’s liver. During four weeks of the experiment 64 Wistar rats were divided into four groups of 16 individuals each (eight individuals of both sexes) and fed a commercial feed mixture for rats (group C) or diet containing 70 % commercial mixture for rats and 30 % freshly cooked egg yolks from laying hens fed diets with 3 % fish oil (group F), 3 % palm olein (group P) or 3 % lard (group L). Dietary supplementation with egg yolks significantly increased the <b>hepatic</b> cholesterol <b>pool</b> in rats, regardless of the type of fat in the diet of laying hens from which the eggs originated. The content of α-linolenic acid in the liver of male rats in group P was 4 - 6 times higher compared to males in the other groups. Liver lipids and their fatty-acid composition differ by both, sex and dietary modified egg yolk composition in rats...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model was constructed {{to define the}} dynamics of incorporation of radioactivity into urea carbon and the guanidine carbon of arginine in plasma albumin after the rapid intraportal-venous administration of Na 214 CO 3 in the isolated perfused rat liver. 2. The model was formulated in terms of compartmental analysis and additional experiments were designed to provide further information on subsystem dynamics and to discriminate between alternative model structures. 3. Evidence for the rapid-time-constant of labelling of intracellular arginine was provided by precursor-product analysis of precursor [14 C]carboante and product [14 C]urea in the perfusate. 4. Compartmental analysis {{of the dynamics of}} newly synthesized urea was based on the fate of exogenous [13 C]urea, endogenous [14 C]urea and the accumulation of [12 C]urea in perfusate water, confirming the early completion of urea carbon labelling, the absence of continuing synthesis of labelled urea, and the presence of a small intrahepatic urea-delay pool. 5. Analysis of the perfusate dynamics of endogenously synthesized and exogenously administered [6 - 14 C]arginine indicated that although the capacity for extrahepatic formation of [14 C]-urea exists, little or no arginine formed within the intrahepatic urea cycle was transported out of the liver. However, the presence of a rapidly turning-over intrahepatic arginine pool was confirmed. 6. On the basis of these subsystem analyses it was possible to offer feasible estimations for the parameters of the {{mathematical model}}. However, {{it was not possible to}} stimulate the form and magnitude of the dynamics of newly synthesized labelled urea and albumin which were simultaneously observed after administration of [14 C]carbonate on the basis of a preliminary model which postulated that both products were derived from a single <b>hepatic</b> <b>pool</b> of [16 - 14 C]arginine. On the other hand these observed dynamics could be satisfied to a two-compartment arginine model, which also provided an explanation for discrepancies observed between albumin synthesis measured radioisotopically and immunologically. This was based on a relative overestimation of [14 C]urea specific radioactivity resulting from the rapid dynamics of [14 C]carbonate and the [14 C]urea subsystem relative to the labelled albumin subsystem. The effects of arginine compartmentalization could be minimized in the model by minor slowing of the rate of [14 C]carbonate turnover or by constant infusion of [14 C]carbonate, both of which permitted valid determination of albumin-synthesis rates...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: ACAT 2 is the {{exclusive}} cholesterol-esterifying enzyme in hepatocytes and enterocytes. Hepatic ABCA 1 transfers unesterified cholesterol (UC) to apoAI, thus generating HDL. By changing the <b>hepatic</b> UC <b>pool</b> available for ABCA 1, ACAT 2 may affect HDL metabolism. The {{aim of this}} study was to reveal whether hepatic ACAT 2 influences HDL metabolism. Design: WT and LXRa/b double knockout (DOKO) mice were fed a western-type diet for 8 weeks. Animals were i. p. injected with an antisense oligonucleotide targeted to hepatic ACAT 2 (ASO 6), or with an ASO control. Injections started 4 weeks after, or concomitantly with, the beginning of the diet. Results: ASO 6 reduced liver cholesteryl esters, while not inducing UC accumulation. ASO 6 increased hepatic ABCA 1 protein independently of the diet conditions. ASO 6 affected HDL lipids (increased UC) only in DOKO, while it increased apoE-containing HDL in both genotypes. In WT mice ASO 6 led to the appearance of large HDL enriched in apoAI and apoE. Conclusions: The use of ASO 6 revealed a new pathway by which the liver may contribute to HDL metabolism in mice...|$|R

Glutathione (GSH) derives from cysteine and {{plays a key role}} in redox status. GSH synthesis is determined mainly by cysteine availability and γ-glutamate cysteine ligase (γGCL) activity. Because PPARα activation is known to control the metabolism of certain amino acids, GSH synthesis from cysteine and related metabolisms were explored in wild-type (WT) and PPARα-null (KO) mice, fed diets containing either saturated (COCO diet) or 18 : 3 n- 3, LIN diet. In mice fed the COCO diet, but not in those fed the LIN diet, PPARα deficiency enhanced hepatic GSH content and γGCL activity, superoxide dismutase 2 mRNA levels, and plasma uric acid concentration, suggesting an oxidative stress.

40|$|During the {{analysis}} of liver protein expression in the offspring of male mice irradiated with fission-spectrum neutrons, one offspring displayed a heritable 50 % decrease in the abundance of two proteins. Homozygous mice lacking detectable quantities of these proteins were obtained through breeding. Characterization of this protein deficiency has identified these liver proteins as forms of the enzyme 10 -formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (10 -formyl-THF DH; 10 -formyltetrahydrofolate:NADP+ oxidoreductase, EC 1. 5. 1. 6). NH 2 -terminal sequence analysis demonstrated that both proteins share identical sequences in the first 25 residues, and this sequence matches (96 % identity) that of rat and human 10 -formyl-THF DH. In addition, these proteins showed cross-reactivity to polyclonal antiserum raised against purified rat 10 -formyl-THF DH. Southern (DNA) blot analysis revealed a {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} consistent with a deletion mutation in the 10 -formyl-THF DH structural gene in homozygous mice. Results of Northern (RNA) blot analysis demonstrated the absence of 10 -formyl-THF DH mRNA in mice lacking 10 -formyl-THF DH protein. Furthermore, liver cytosolic 10 -formyl-THF DH enzymatic activity was undetectable in homozygotes. Measurement of <b>hepatic</b> folate <b>pools</b> showed that in homozygotes the total folate pool is decreased and the level of tetrahydrofolate is markedly depleted...|$|R
40|$|We {{tested the}} impact of {{long-term}} near normoglycemia (HbA 1 c 1 year) on glycogen metabolism in seven type 1 diabetic and seven matched nondiabetic subjects after a mixed meal. Glycemic profiles (6. 2 � 0. 10 vs. 5. 9 � 0. 07 mmol/l; P < 0. 05) of diabetic patients were approximated to that of nondiabetic subjects by variable insulin infusion. Rates of hepatic glycogen synthesis and breakdown were calculated from the glycogen concentration time curves between 7 : 30 P. M. and 8 : 00 A. M. using in vivo 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Glucose production was determined with D-[6, 6 - 2 H 2]glucose, and the <b>hepatic</b> uridine-diphosphate glucose <b>pool</b> was sampled with acetaminophen.

30|$|Regarding semi-quantitative {{analysis}} with iPERCIST, we monitored the SULpeak of the lesion with highest uptake at SCAN- 1 and SCAN- 2. The average decrease in SULpeak {{of the highest}} uptake lesion was 75 % for patients with CMR, 53 % for patients with PMR, and 5 % for patients with SMD. Among non-responders, SULpeak increased by 55 %, on average. In 4 / 28 patients, {{we were unable to}} monitor the SULpeak because the difference between pre-treatment and post-treatment <b>hepatic</b> and blood <b>pool</b> SUL was >[*] 20 % (PERCIST recommendation [14]). Among these four patients, two were classified as UPMD due to the appearance of numerous lesions, one was classified as PMR due to the disappearance of all lesions except one, and one was classified as SMD because of the stability of the SULpeak {{as well as in the}} size of the lesions.|$|R
40|$|Hepatic {{glycogen}} concentration {{was measured}} in six subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and nine weight-matched control subjects using 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy during a day in which three isocaloric mixed meals were ingested. The relative fluxes of the direct and indirect (3 carbon units [...] > [...] >glycogen) pathways of hepatic glycogen synthesis were also assessed using [1 - 13 C]glucose in combination with acetaminophen to noninvasively sample the <b>hepatic</b> UDP-glucose <b>pool.</b> Mean fasting <b>hepatic</b> glycogen content was similar in the two groups. After each meal, hepatic glycogen content increased, peaking 4 - 5 h after the meal in both groups. By 11 : 00 p. m. the IDDM subjects had synthesized only 30 % of the glycogen that was synthesized by the control group [IDDM subjects, net increment = 44 +/- 20 (mean +/- SE) mM; control subjects, net increment = 144 +/- 14 mM; P < 0. 05]. After breakfast the flux through the gluconeogenic pathway relative to the direct pathway of hepatic glycogen synthesis was 1. 7 -fold greater in the IDDM subjects (59 +/- 4 %) than in the control subjects (35 +/- 4 %, P < 0. 0003). In conclusion, under mixed meal conditions, subjects with poorly controlled IDDM have a major defect in net hepatic glycogen synthesis and augmented hepatic gluconeogenesis. The former abnormality may result in an impaired glycemic response to counterregulatory hormones, whereas both abnormalities may contribute to postprandial hyperglycemia...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{incidence of}} overweight {{is accompanied by}} a plethora of medical symptoms together called the metabolic syndrome. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, characterized by persistent storage of lipids in the liver, is regarded as the hepatic component of the metabolic syndrome. An imbalance between influx to and efflux from the <b>hepatic</b> triglyceride <b>pool</b> results in <b>hepatic</b> lipid accumulation. How hepatic lipid accumulation or steatosis develops is incompletely understood and the molecular origin may vary between different individuals and different animal models. In this dissertation we examine adaptations in fatty acid and glucose metabolism in two mouse models that develop a fatty liver: pharmacological activation of liver X receptor (LXR) and genetic deletion of hepatic glucose- 6 -phosphatase (L-G 6 pc-/- mice). We show that the origin of hepatic steatosis can adapt to different circumstances in mouse models of fatty liver disease. In the case of LXR activation the origin of a fatty liver alters with treatment time, while in L-G 6 pc-/- mice the origin of hepatic fat accumulation varies between fasting and feeding. In L-G 6 pc-/- mice we furthermore investigate changes in hepatic glucose metabolism. We also describe how we use in vivo physiological data in a mathematical modeling approach to examine LXR-induced time-dependent changes in triglyceride metabolism. We provide data that show that including information about gene expression levels in this mathematical model can improve its predictive value. Next to this, we present a theoretical mechanism that explains the insulin resistance paradox from the viewpoint of zonation of metabolic processes in the liver...|$|R
