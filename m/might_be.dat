5|$|Analysis is the {{activity}} of breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts {{in order to understand}} it. Reductionism can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism is the belief that all fields of study are ultimately amenable to scientific explanation. Perhaps a historical event <b>might</b> <b>be</b> explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn <b>might</b> <b>be</b> described in terms of human physiology, which in turn <b>might</b> <b>be</b> described in terms of chemistry and physics. Daniel Dennett distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls greedy reductionism, which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations.|$|E

5000|$|Another of his targets {{is what he}} terms [...] "moral historicism", {{the attempt}} to infer moral values from the course of history; in Hegel's words, that [...] "history is the world's court of justice". This may {{take the form of}} {{conservatism}} (former <b>might</b> <b>is</b> right), positivism (<b>might</b> <b>is</b> right) or futurism (presumed coming <b>might</b> <b>is</b> right). As against these, Popper says that he does not believe [...] "that success proves anything or that history is our judge". Futurism must be distinguished from prophecies that the right will prevail: these attempt to infer history from ethics, rather than ethics from history, and are therefore historicism in the normal sense rather than moral historicism.|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that effects related to either electrostatic charging or discharging <b>might</b> <b>be</b> able to account for some of the transient lunar phenomena.

If this were to occur at the surface, the subsequent discharge from this gas <b>might</b> <b>be</b> able to give rise to phenomena visible from Earth. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the triboelectric charging of particles within a gas-borne dust cloud could give rise to electrostatic discharges visible from Earth. Finally, electrostatic levitation of dust near the terminator could potentially give rise to some form of phenomenon visible from Earth.|$|E

5|$|The African river martin feeds in flocks over {{river and}} forest, often far from water. It eats insects, mainly taking winged ants. The flight {{is strong and}} fast, {{interspersed}} with glides. Wintering birds regularly perch on treetops, wires and roofs. The white-eyed river martin feeds on insects, including beetles, which are caught on the wing. Given its size and unusual mouth structure, it may take larger insects than other swallows. This species is described as graceful and buoyant in flight, and, like its African relative, appears reluctant to use perches. This behaviour, together with its unusual toe-shape {{and the fact that}} mud was found on the toes of one of the first specimens, suggests that this species may be relatively terrestrial. In winter, it roosts with barn swallows in reedbeds. Pamela C. Rasmussen suggested that, given its unusually large eyes, the species <b>might</b> <b>be</b> nocturnal or crepuscular, a factor that could make it highly cryptic and thus partly explain how such a distinctive species remained undetected for so long. Although the fact that the first specimens were supposedly collected roosting at night in reed-beds <b>might</b> <b>be</b> a contraindication, {{it is possible that the}} birds might not actually have been caught at the roost; or they <b>might</b> <b>be</b> crepuscular, feeding at dawn and dusk; or they <b>might</b> <b>be</b> capable of both diurnal and nocturnal behaviour, depending on the season or local circumstances.|$|E
