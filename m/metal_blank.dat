50|$|Measurement of {{the amount}} of drawing {{performed}} on a sheet <b>metal</b> <b>blank</b> is quantified using drawing ratio. The higher the drawing ratio, the more extreme the amount of deep drawing. Due to the geometry, forces, metal flow and material properties of the work, {{there is a limit to}} the amount of deep drawing that can be performed on a sheet <b>metal</b> <b>blank</b> in a single operation. The drawing ratio is roughly calculated as,DR = Db/Dp.Db is the diameter of the blank and Dp is the diameter of the punch. For shapes that are noncircular the maximum diameter is sometimes used, or occasionally drawing ratio is calculated using surface areas. The limit to the drawing ratio for an operation is usually 2 or under.|$|E

Nonstationary heat transfer {{is characterized by}} the fact that the temperature changes not only from point to point, but also in time. The process of cooling <b>metal</b> <b>blanks</b> must be considered a transient thermal conductivity. When solving the problem of cooling <b>metal</b> <b>blanks</b> we need to find the temperature change in the section. The authors show the complexity of the tasks of nonstationary heat transfer. If we consider the process of cooling metal billets as a complex process, in which the addition of nonstationary heat transfer is presented as a process of heat transfer by radiation, great probability of errors in calculations occurs. There is the feasibility of the use of experimental researches of cooling processes for <b>metal</b> <b>blanks</b> after continuous casting, in order to determine the error in the calculated values...|$|R
40|$|Design and {{realisation}} of a <b>metal</b> <b>blanking</b> {{process in}} current industrial practice are mainly based on empirical knowledge. For more sophisticated applications, involving high accuracy geometry specifications, or non-standard materials and product shapes, this empirical approach often fails. This paper presents {{a set of}} interrelated numerical techniques resulting in a finite element model of the <b>metal</b> <b>blanking</b> process, focusing on the prediction of {{the shape of the}} cut edge of a blanked product. The large, localised deformations are handled by an Operator Split Arbitrary Lagrange Euler (OS-ALE) method supplemented by full remeshing. Transport of the state variables between subsequent meshes for the OS-ALE and remeshing methods is accomplished by the Discontinous Galerkin (DG) method and an interpolation procedure, respectively. Ductile fracture is incorporated using a discrete cracking approach, which is shown to generate mesh independent results...|$|R

5000|$|Deep {{drawing is}} a {{sheet metal forming}} process in which a sheet <b>metal</b> <b>blank</b> is {{radially}} drawn into a forming die by the mechanical action of a punch. It is thus a shape transformation process with material retention. The process is considered [...] "deep" [...] drawing when {{the depth of the}} drawn part exceeds its diameter. This is achieved by redrawing the part through a series of dies. The flange region (sheet metal in the die shoulder area) experiences a radial drawing stress and a tangential compressive stress due to the material retention property. These compressive stresses (hoop stresses) result in flange wrinkles (wrinkles of the first order). Wrinkles can be prevented by using a blank holder, the function of which is to facilitate controlled material flow into the die radius.|$|E

40|$|The work is {{dedicated}} to EMF attraction processes which can deform both ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic sheet metal materials (low carbon steels, stainless steels and aluminum alloys) using low frequency discharges. The analytical models of both tooling configurations are based upon the solution of Maxwell equations in axially symmetrical formulation. For ferromagnetic materials, the attraction effect is based upon magnetic forces prevailing over the Lorentz forces for low frequency discharges. For nonferromagnetic materials, the attraction forces are created by employing the auxiliary screen which attracts the sheet <b>metal</b> <b>blank.</b> The concept of attraction in this inductor system is based upon inducing currents flowing in the same directions in the screen and in the sheet <b>metal</b> <b>blank.</b> In addition to the analytical models, the described concepts are illustrated by the experimental results on attraction of sheet metal blanks employing a single turn inductor...|$|E

In addition, it is demonstrated how the signature of the force-displacement relation changes significantly with increasing tool wear in a typical configuration of sheet steel blanking. An analysis follows as to how such behaviour could be used in CBM. A practical implementation of CBM in sheet <b>metal</b> <b>blanking</b> is proposed based on a hybrid solution.
