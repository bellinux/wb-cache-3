Abe began his studies at Tokyo Imperial University in 1943 to study medicine, partially {{out of respect for}} his father, but also because [...] "hose students who specialized in medicine were exempted from becoming soldiers. <b>My</b> <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> chose the humanities were killed in the war." [...] He {{returned to}} Manchuria around the end of World War II. Specifically, Abe left the Tokyo University Medical School in October 1944, returning to his father's clinic in Mukden. That winter, his father died of eruptive typhus. Returning to Tokyo with his father's ashes, Abe reentered the medical school. Abe started writing novellas and short stories during his last year in university. He graduated in 1948 with a medical degree, joking once that he was allowed to graduate only on the condition that he would not practice.|$|E

Mohandas Gandhi first read Walden in 1906 while working as a civil rights activist in Johannesburg, South Africa. He first read Civil Disobedience [...] "while he sat in a South African prison for the crime of nonviolently protesting discrimination against the Indian population in the Transvaal. The essay galvanized Gandhi, who wrote and published a synopsis of Thoreau's argument, calling its 'incisive logic [...] unanswerable' and referring to Thoreau as 'one of the greatest and most moral men America has produced'." [...] He told American reporter Webb Miller, [...] " [...] ideas influenced me greatly. I adopted some of them and recommended the study of Thoreau to all of <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> were helping me in the cause of Indian Independence.
