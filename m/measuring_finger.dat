40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{address the}} {{disability}} impact on fine hand motor functions {{in patients with}} Multiple Sclerosis (MS) by quantitatively <b>measuring</b> <b>finger</b> opposition movements, {{with the aim of}} providing a new "score" integrating current methods for disability assessment. METHODS: 40 MS patients (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) : 0 - 7) and 80 healthy controls (HC) performed a repetitive finger-to-thumb opposition sequence with their dominant hand at spontaneous and maximal velocity, and uni- and bi-manually metronome-paced. A sensor-engineered glove was used to measure finger motor performance. Twenty-seven HC were tested twice, one month apart, to assess test-retest reliability. RESULTS: The motor parameters showed a good reproducibility in HC and demonstrated significantly worse performance in MS patients with respect to HC. A multivariate model revealed that rate of movement in the spontaneous velocity condition and inter-hand interval (IHI), indicating bimanual coordination, contributed independently to differentiate the two groups. A finger motor impairment score based on these two parameters was able to discriminate HC from MS patients with very low EDSS scores (p< 0. 001) : a significant difference was already evident for patients with EDSS =  0. Further, in the MS group, some motor performance parameters correlated with the clinical scores. In particular, significant correlations were found between IHI and EDSS (r =  0. 56; p< 0. 0001), MS Functional Composite (r = - 0. 40; p =  0. 01), Paced Auditory Serial Addition (r = - 0. 38; p =  0. 02). No motor performance parameter correlated with Timed 25 -Foot Walk. CONCLUSIONS: A simple, quantitative, objective method <b>measuring</b> <b>finger</b> motor performance could be used to define a score discriminating healthy controls and MS patients, even with very low disability. This sensitivity might be of crucial importance for monitoring the disease course and the treatment effects in early MS patients, when changes in the EDSS are small or absent...|$|E

Traditional temperature biofeedback uses the contact sensor of a thermistor to measure one’s finger surface temperature. The goal {{of this study is to}} discover new valid sensors for temperature biofeedback. Sixteen healthy young adult volunteers (23. 1 ± 2. 0 years old) practiced cognitive imagery muscle relaxation with three kinds of temperature sensors (thermography imaging, thermistor, and infrared thermopile) to measure their finger surfaces simultaneously. The temperature readings from different sensors were synchronically videotaped and converged to video files for analyses. The data were selected every half a minute from a fixed section of the muscle relaxation procedure to show the outline of the temperature variation. Twenty-eight means of skin temperature measurements from each sensor resulted in overall correlation coefficients of R= 0. 98 (p< 0. 001) between the thermistor and thermography imaging sensors, R= 0. 95 (p< 0. 001) between thermography imaging and infrared thermopile sensors, and R= 0. 96 (p< 0. 001) between thermistor and infrared thermopile sensors. These results suggest that contact and non-contact temperature sensors could demonstrate good synchronous temperature covariance in <b>measuring</b> <b>finger</b> surface temperature.

40|$|Dynamic {{movements}} of the hand, fingers and thumb are difficult to measure due to the versatility and complexity of movement inherent in function. An innovative approach to measuring hand kinematics is proposed and validated. The proposed system utilises the Microsoft KinectTM and goes beyond gesture recognition, to develop a validated measurement technique of finger kinematics. The proposed system adopted landmark definition (validated through ground truth estimation against assessors) and grip classification algorithms, including kinematic definitions (validated against a laboratory-based motion capture system). The results of the validation show 78 % accuracy when identifying specific markerless landmarks. In addition, comparative data with a previously validated kinematic measurement technique show accuracy of MCP± 10 ° (average absolute error (AAE) = 2. 4 °), PIP± 12 ° (AAE = 4. 8 °) and DIP± 11 ° (AAE = 4. 8 °). These results are notably better than clinically based alternative manual measurement techniques. The ability to measure hand movements, and therefore functional dexterity, without interfering with underlying composite movements, is the paramount objective to any bespoke measurement system.

40|$|The {{study of}} finger {{kinematics}} has developed into an important research area. Various hand tracking systems are currently available; however, {{they all have}} limited functionality. Generally, the most commonly adopted sensors are limited to measurements with one degree of freedom, i. e., flexion/extension of fingers. More advanced measurements including finger abduction, adduction, and circumduction are {{much more difficult to}} achieve. To overcome these limitations, we propose a two-axis 3 D printed optical sensor with a compact configuration for tracking finger motion. Based on Malus’ law, this sensor detects the angular changes by analyzing the attenuation of light transmitted through polarizing film. The sensor consists of two orthogonal axes each containing two pathways. The two readings from each axis are fused using a weighted average approach, enabling a measurement range up to 180 ∘ and an improvement in sensitivity. The sensor demonstrates high accuracy (± 0. 3 ∘), high repeatability, and low hysteresis error. Attaching the sensor to the index finger’s metacarpophalangeal joint, real-time movements consisting of flexion/extension, abduction/adduction and circumduction have been successfully recorded.

To evaluate {{the accuracy of}} FAP in measuring ABPNI and CONI {{as well as the}} adequacy of detecting changes in ABP and CO, we compared FAP to intra-arterially measured blood pressure (ABPIA) and transpulmonary thermodilution (COTD) in postcardiac surgery patients during a fluid challenge (FC). Methods Twenty sedated patients post cardiac surgery were included, and 28 FCs were performed. Measurements of ABP and CO were simultaneously collected before and after an FC, and we compared CO and blood pressure. Results Finger arterial pressure was obtainable in all patients. When comparing ABPNI with ABPIA, bias was 2. 7 mm Hg (limits of agreement [LOA], ± 22. 2), 4. 9 mm Hg (LOA, ± 13. 6), and 4. 2 mm Hg (LOA, ± 13. 7) for systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure, respectively. Concordance between changes in ABPNI and ABPIA was 100 %. Mean bias between CONI and COTD was − 0. 26 (LOA, ± 2. 2), with a percentage error of 38. 9 %.

40|$|International audienceAfter limb amputation, {{patients}} often {{wake up with}} a vivid {{perception of}} the presence of the missing limb, called "phantom limb". Phantom limbs have mostly been studied with respect to pain sensation. But patients can experience many other phantom sensations, including voluntary movements. The goal {{of the present study was}} to quantify phantom movement kinematics and relate these to intact limb kinematics and to the time elapsed since amputation. Six upper arm and two forearm amputees with various delays since amputation (6 months to 32 years) performed phantom finger, hand and wrist movements at self-chosen comfortable velocities. The kinematics of the phantom movements was indirectly obtained via the intact limb that synchronously mimicked the phantom limb movements, using a Cyberglove® for <b>measuring</b> <b>finger</b> movements and an inertial measurement unit for wrist movements. Results show that the execution of phantom movements is perceived as "natural" but effortful. The types of phantom movements that can be performed are variable between the patients but they could all perform thumb flexion/extension and global hand opening/closure. Finger extension movements appeared to be 24 % faster than finger flexion movements. Neither the number of types of phantom movements that can be executed nor the kinematic characteristics were related to the elapsed time since amputation, highlighting the persistence of post-amputation neural adaptation. We hypothesize that the perceived slowness of phantom movements is related to altered proprioceptive feedback that cannot be recalibrated by lack of visual feedback during phantom movement execution...|$|E

40|$|Renal hypoxia {{is thought}} to be an {{important}} pathophysiological factor in the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the associated hypertension. In a previous study among CKD patients, supplementation with 100 % oxygen reduced sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and lowered blood pressure (BP). We aimed to assess the underlying haemodynamic modulation and hypothesized a decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR). To that end, 19 CKD patients were studied during 15 -min intervals of increasing partial oxygen pressure (ppO 2) from room air (0. 21 ATA) to 1. 0 ATA and further up to 2. 4 ATA, while continuously <b>measuring</b> <b>finger</b> arterial blood pressure (Finapres). Off-line, we derived indexes of SVR, cardiac output (CO) and baroreflex sensitivity from the continuous BP recordings (Modelflow). During oxygen supplementation, systolic, and diastolic BP both increased dose-dependently from 128 ± 24 and 72 ± 19 mmHg respectively at baseline to 141 ± 23 (p < 0. 001) and 80 ± 21 mmHg (p < 0. 001) at 1. 0 ATA oxygen. Comparing baseline and 1. 0 ATA oxygen, SVR increased from 1440 ± 546 to 1745 ± 710 dyn·s/cm(5) (p = 0. 009), heart rate decreased from 60 ± 8 to 58 ± 6 bpm (p < 0. 001) and CO from 5. 0 ± 1. 3 to 4. 6 ± 1. 1 L/min (p = 0. 02).

The test did result in a small difference between the two sessions which pointed at the calming measures giving a slight improvement for the pilots. However, when ANOVA was applied it showed that the difference between the two sessions was not a significant one. This could be due to several reasons; the pilots were not used to the calming measures and because of this felt more stressed when trying to use the calming measures as well. There might have been a difference if calming measures were included into pilot training already from the beginning.

The primary aim of this work is {{to gain a better understanding}} of the effects of different aspects of exposure to finger transmitted vibration (FTV) related to operators using hand-held vibrating tools. To achieve this, firstly, a new method for <b>measuring</b> <b>finger</b> transmitted vibration was developed and assessed, including a tool vibration test rig and measurement protocol. The effect on FTV measurement of using a small accelerometer attached to the back of the finger was investigated using 2 D finite element modelling. Comparisons were also made using a laser vibrometer. Analysis showed that the new test rig is capable of measuring FTV at frequencies ranging from 10 to 400 Hz, under different grip force levels, and that adding a small accelerometer mass (0. 3 grams) did not significantly affect measurements. A human participant study then carried out using the new rig. Various characteristic measurements were collected in tandem, including anthropometry, skin characterisation and behaviour under loading to investigate the effect of different factors on FTV. The results showed that FTV varied among individuals and the key finding was that exposure to vibration has a significant effect on finger temperature even for a short period of testing. Anti-vibration (AV) glove materials were investigated using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and tested using human participants. The results showed that the mechanical properties of AV materials change under real world industrial conditions such as excitation frequencies and temperature. Finally, a new artificial test-bed was developed to replicate the transmitted vibration of the index finger. Studies were conducted on a range of 5 test-beds, to allow comparison with the human measurements, including indentation, vibration transmissibility and FE modelling. FE modelling showed that the distribution of dynamic strain was found to be highest in the vasculature region of the finger, indicating that this could be one of the contributing factors of VWF. One of the finger test-bed was selected as best replicating the mechanical properties of the real finger. The artificial test-bed provided better consistency than human participants, for testing parameters, such as grip force, and can be used in future for testing AV gloves with no need for human subjects. ii Further investigations are suggested to be made to enhance the limitations of this project, including material analysis, testing protocol and finite element modelling.

The goal of the practical part {{is to find out}} fingers pinch in hand grasp in normal healthy preschool children using a specialy developed handwriting tool and to recommend another possibilites of using this new tool in handwriting training...|$|R
40|$|The study aims to {{integrate}} the image sensor for a three-axial pneumatic parallel manipulator which can pick and place objects automatically by the feature information of the image processed through the SURF algorithm. The SURF algorithm is adopted for defining and matching the features of a target object and an object database. In order to accurately mark the center of target and strengthen the feature matching results, the random sample and consensus method (RANSAC) is utilized. The ASUS Xtion Pro Live depth camera which can directly estimate the 3 -D location of the target point is used in this study. A set of coordinate estimation calibrations is developed for enhancing the accuracy of target location estimation. This study also presents hand gesture recognition exploiting skin detection and noise elimination to determine the active finger count for input signals of the parallel manipulator. The end-effector of the parallel manipulator can be manipulated to the desired poses according to the <b>measured</b> <b>finger</b> count. Finally, the proposed methods are successfully to achieve the feature recognition and pick and place of the target object...|$|R
50|$|The Power Glove was {{originally}} released in 1989. Though {{it was an}} officially licensed product, Nintendo {{was not involved in}} the design or release of this accessory. Rather, it was designed by Grant Goddard and Samuel Cooper Davis for Abrams/Gentile Entertainment (AGE), made by Mattel in the United States and PAX in Japan. Additional development was accomplished through the efforts of Thomas G. Zimmerman and Jaron Lanier, a virtual reality pioneer responsible for codeveloping and commercializing the DataGlove, who had made a failed attempt at a similar design for Nintendo earlier.Mattel brought in Image Design and Marketing's Hal Berger and Gary Yamron to develop the raw technology into a functional product. They designed Power Glove over the course of eight weeks. The Power Glove and DataGlove were based on Zimmerman's instrumented glove. Zimmerman built the first prototype that demonstrated finger flex measurement and hand position tracking using a pair of ultrasonic transmitters. His original prototype used optical flex sensors to <b>measure</b> <b>finger</b> bending which were replaced with less expensive carbon-based flex sensors by the AGE team.|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} for {{measuring}} both the posture of human fingers and shear force at human fingertips is presented. Instead {{of using a}} traditional electronic glove with bending sensors embedded along the finger and shear sensors embedded beneath the fingertip, a wearable fingernail sensor is used to measure resulting changes in coloration of the fingernail. Since the sensor is mounted on the fingernail, finger posture can be measured without wearing a glove that hampers {{the motion of the}} fingers. Similarly, shear forces can be measured without covering the finger pad and obstructing the human’s natural haptic sense. In the past, fingernail sensors with a one-dimensional array of photodetectors have been used to measure normal touching forces at the fingertip. A new fingernail sensor with a two-dimensional spatial array of photodetectors is constructed in order to <b>measure</b> <b>finger</b> posture and shear forces. Experiments are performed in order to measure the outputs of the photodetectors in response to changes in finger posture and applied normal and shear forces. Analysis is then performed to correlate the outputs to the inputs and provide a means of estimating normal forces, shear forces, and changes in finger posture. 1...|$|R
