500|$|In 2007, Beckinsale starred {{opposite}} Sam Rockwell in {{the independent}} drama Snow Angels, {{based on the novel}} by Stewart O'Nan. The harrowing film, in which she played an overwhelmed single mother, put Beckinsale [...] "in kind of a tough place." [...] "I did have <b>my</b> <b>kid,</b> my husband and, in fact, my ex was around a lot, so it was very nice to come home to my people whom I love." [...] Puig felt [...] "Beckinsale gives her best performance in years" [...] while Richard Corliss of Time described it as [...] "her sharpest work yet." [...] However, Scott felt that [...] "her skill and discipline cannot overcome the sense that she is an exotic species transplanted into this grim ecosystem. Hard as she works to convince us otherwise, it’s a stretch to believe that a woman with the kind of poised confidence in her own beauty she manifests would wind up with an underachieving mouth breather like Glenn." [...] The film grossed just $414,404 worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Giles' truth, {{according}} to Whedon, {{is that he}} realizes he must not [...] "fight my kid's battles or <b>my</b> <b>kid</b> will never grow up", which he sings in [...] "Standing" [...] while he throws knives at Buffy {{as part of her}} training. Whedon remarked that this touch [...] "is the kind of complete turnaround that is a staple of the Buffy universe". Tara's heartfelt love song also has an ironic subtext; although she appears to mean that she is fulfilled by her relationship with Willow, the lyrics include multiple allusions to Willow working her manipulative will over Tara, overlaid with Tara's euphoric singing about her pleasure in their union. In , Lorna Jowett calls the song between Willow and Tara the transformational event in their relationship, from Tara's subservient bearing towards Willow, into a relationship of equals. Two Buffy essayists note that Willow and Giles sing together {{at the start of the}} episode, but later Tara and Giles share a duet to express the diminished part each plays in their respective relationships.|$|E

It has been described by Crow as a return to the sound of her nineties work, and intentionally eschews the country-influenced sound of her previous album. She has said that she did not enjoy the political promotion system utilized by country radio, saying: [...] "You do lots of free [...] for radio stations in trade for getting played between three and four in the morning.

[...] This was later recreated during Ronnie's 2017 wedding to Jack where Roxy and Ronnie danced to The Girls once again spraying guests with soda syphon's.
