In this study, the authors investigate employment growth of firms in Turkey with an emphasis on small and <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> <b>enterprises.</b> In Turkey, small and <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> <b>enterprises</b> account for almost 77 percent of employment and {{play a crucial role in}} the economy. However, the analysis of firm dynamics in Turkey shows that medium-size firms (51 - 250 workers) are theslowest growing group in the economy. Moreover, small and <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> <b>enterprises</b> grow at a slower rate in Turkey than in several comparator countries in the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region. After determining this irregularity, the paper analyzes how the investment climate affects firm growth and finds that improved access to finance is the most important factor that significantly increases firm growth rates.
