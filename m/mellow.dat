He was asked to play the music faster for more comedic effect but eventually his original slower version was accepted.|$|E

5|$|Aging / Curing: While {{not always}} {{required}}, some teas required additional aging, secondary fermentation, or baking {{to reach their}} drinking potential. For instance, a green tea puerh, prior to curing into a post-fermented tea, is often bitter and harsh in taste, but becomes sweet and <b>mellow</b> through fermentation by age or dampness. Additionally, oolong can benefit from aging if fired over charcoal. Flavoured teas are manufactured in this stage by spraying the tea with aromas and flavours or by storing them with their flavorants.|$|E
50|$|Members {{who reached}} {{seventeen}} {{years of age}} were recruited into the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), and in 1912 Hobson started an IRB circle within the Fianna, named the John Mitchel Literary and Debating Society, whose members included Colbert, Ó Riain, Heuston, Garry Holohan, Desmond Ryan, Liam <b>Mellows</b> and Barney <b>Mellows.</b>|$|R

5|$|Developments in the New York {{new school}} {{continuum}} {{in this climate}} were represented by the Native Tongues groups—The Jungle Brothers, De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, Queen Latifah and Monie Love—along with fellow travellers like Leaders of the New School, KMD and Brand Nubian. They moved away from aggressive, macho posturing, towards ambiguity, fun and Afrocentricity. Their music was sample-crowded, more open and accessible than their new school predecessors. De La Soul's debut sampled everyone from The Turtles to Steely Dan, while A Tribe Called Quest matched tough beats to <b>mellow</b> jazz samples and playful, thoughtful raps.|$|E
5|$|Farmer {{moved from}} trumpet to playing mostly flugelhorn {{from the early}} 1960s, utilising the latter instrument's more <b>mellow</b> sound and Farmer's ability {{to get what he}} wanted from it without having to use a mute. In 1989, he played a major part in {{creating}} a trumpet–flugelhorn hybrid, the flumpet, which was constructed for him by instrument maker David Monette. This instrument allowed him to play with more expression in a range of settings, from small groups to big bands. In 1997, Monette presented him with a personalized flumpet, with decorations symbolising important people and places in Farmer's life.|$|E

5|$|Sweltering / Yellowing: Unique {{to yellow}} teas, warm and damp tea leaves from after kill-green {{are allowed to}} be lightly heated in a closed container, which causes the {{previously}} green leaves to turn yellow. The resulting leaves produce a beverage that has a distinctive yellowish-green hue due to transformations of the leaf chlorophyll. Through being sweltered for 6–8 hours at close to human body temperatures, the amino acids and polyphenols in the processed tea leaves undergo chemical changes to give this tea its distinct briskness and <b>mellow</b> taste.|$|E
5|$|The A and B {{clarinets}} {{have nearly}} the same bore and use the same mouthpiece. Orchestral clarinetists using the A and B instruments in a concert could use the same mouthpiece (and often the same barrel) (see 'usage' below). The A and B have nearly identical tonal quality, although the A typically has a slightly warmer sound. The tone of the E clarinet is brighter and can be heard even through loud orchestral or concert band textures. The bass clarinet has a characteristically deep, <b>mellow</b> sound, while the alto clarinet is similar in tone to the bass (though not as dark).|$|E
5|$|The Astonishing {{is set in}} a dystopian future United States {{and follows}} the Ravenskill Rebel Militia in their efforts to defy the Great Northern Empire of the Americas using the magical power of music. It was {{inspired}} by contemporary fantasy and science fiction franchises such as Game of Thrones and Star Wars, as well as Petrucci's observations on the ubiquity of technological automation in modern-day society. In their effort to match the album's narrative, Dream Theater wrote songs {{in a wide variety of}} styles ranging from <b>mellow</b> ballads to their more conventional progressive metal sound.|$|E
