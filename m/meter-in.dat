50|$|Complicating matters was that, in August 1879, after P. Jurgenson {{had already}} started {{engraving}} the printing plates for the suite, Tchaikovsky realized all the movements were in duple <b>meter—in</b> other words, two beats per measure. He quickly penned a Divertimento in triple meter, which he called a minuet but is actually a waltz, to break up this potential metric monotony. Tchaikovsky suggested replacing the March with the Divertimento. Jurgenson liked the March and suggested letting the suite expand to six movements. Six, to Tchaikovsky, was one movement too many. He suggested that Sergei Taneyev be asked his opinion of the March. If Taneyev thought it worthwhile, then Tchaikovsky wanted to drop the Andante and reorder the movements as Introduction and Fugue, Divertimento, Scherzo, March, Gavotte. The Andante's case was then pleaded to the composer. By the time Rubinstein conducted the premiere, {{the order of the}} six movements was the one finally established.|$|E

First of all, the energy consumption of a traditional load sensing architecture, which uses a single electronically controlled spool valve, is analyzed. For this kind of circuit, {{the position of the}} spool generally determines, at the same time, pressure drops both at the inlet and at the outlet section. The consequence is that in the majority of the situations both the <b>meter-in</b> and the meter-out configuration is not optimized in terms of energy consumption.

In this paper, an adaptive robust pressure controller is used to keep the pressure level in chamber of cylinder {{on an even keel}} when the pneumatic cylinder is moving, which will result in small variation of cylinder’s friction force and facilitate the precise modeling of friction force, and an adaptive robust motion controller is designed to improve the motion tracking accuracy of pneumatic cylinder, and on-line parameter estimation of the flow coefficient is utilized to have improved model compensation, and moreover a synchronization controller is added to further reduce the synchronization error. Experimental results demonstrate that this synchronization strategy could not only make two cylinders synchronized moving accurately, but also obtain very smooth control inputs which indicate the effectiveness of model compensation.

40|$|To {{decrease}} throttling {{losses in}} mobile hydraulic systems {{a number of}} new system architectures have been introduced in recent years. The concept of independent metering (IM), developed in the seventies, shows a lot of promise [1]. By allowing the <b>meter-in</b> as well as meter-out edges to be controlled separately, additional operating modes are created allowing a more efficient adaptation of system pressure to load pressure [2, 3]. Despite these advantages IM circuits have yet to find their way into industrial applications. This is mainly due to the related increase in component costs and more demanding control strategies. Additionally, the effect of mode switching on actuator motion and operator comfort is still unclear and considered to be a challenge. The STEAM mobile hydraulic system currently being developed in Aachen, Germany uses {{a number of new}} features to improve total machine efficiency [4]. Among others is the use of a new independent metering circuit called single edge meter-out control. Unlike other IM configurations, only one proportional valve is used to control cylinder motion. This paper introduces the new concept and discusses its advantages...|$|E
40|$|When the {{difference}} of pressures between inlet cylinder chamber and exhaust one is small and also the sliding velocity of piston becomes considerably small, the stick-slip motion is generated. Under some assumptions, the approximated practical equations of motion of pneumatic cylinder is obtained. The period of stick-slip motion and the displacement of piston during one period of stick-slip motion are also obtained by approximated equations. Analytical {{results show that the}} period of stick-slip motion and the displacement of piston are affected by the position of piston, orifice area of speed controller, pressure of air supply and so on. For example, in the case of meter-out circuit, the period of stick-slip motion and the displacement of stick-slip motion increase as the volume of exhaust cylinder increases. On the contrary, in <b>meter-in</b> circuit, both period and displacement decrease as the volume of exhaust cylinder increases. In either case, the period and the displacement decrease as the pressure of air supply increases. But the influences of load on the period and the displacement are quite small. These results are shown in various diagrams. The theoretical results agree well with the experimental studies...|$|E
40|$|The two {{position}} {{solenoid operated}} cartridge valve {{is widely used}} in the applications, such as process control systems, pavers, agricultural machinery, where response and installed costs {{are more important than}} precise control through electronic position feedback. In recent years, the combination of multiple cartridge valves, so called 'smart valve ' or 'programmable valve', which is able to break the mechanical linkage between the <b>meter-in</b> and meter-out orifices and enables high precision control as well as optimal usage of energy, is gaining engineering interests. But the control of such combination is far from trivial. It demands good knowledge of the valve dynamics and nonlinear flow properties.

40|$|Abstract. Conventional {{electro-hydraulic}} precision {{motion control}} systems {{are controlled by}} either servo valves or proportional directional control valves. Neither of the valves are {{able to control the}} pressures at the two cylinder chambers independently or to use the regeneration flow. The result is that while precision motion control is possible, significant energy saving is not. In order to save energy while maintaining excellent motion performance, the independent control of the pressures at the two cylinder chambers and the accurate use of the regeneration flow are two key factors. The programmable valves, a combination of five independently controlled poppet-type cartridge valves, break the mechanical linkage between the <b>meter-in</b> and meter-out orifices, maintain the full functionality of conventional four-way valves and enable the accurate control of the regeneration flow via the true cross port valve. Therefore, the programmable valves are capable of both precision motion control and significant energy saving.

40|$|The {{energy-saving}} programmable valve, {{a unique}} combination of five independent cartridge valves, not only decouples {{the control of}} <b>meter-in</b> and meter-out flows but also provides the ability of precisely controlling cross-port flows for energysaving purpose. Our previous works have already shown that the tremendous control flexibility gained by the proposed hardware re-configuration enables one not only to achieve precision control of the cylinder motion but also to decrease the energy usage significantly through actively utilizing the potential and kinetic energy of the load in accomplishing certain tasks such as smooth stopping. However, the control of such an essentially multi-input valve system to achieve the above objectives is far from trivial. In our previous works, a constant off-side pressure was assumed in the controller design for simplicity. This assumption may not be realistic in certain circumstances where the off-side pressure may vary from the assumed constant pressure significantly, especially right after the change of working mode. As a result, though the controller design is simplified, larger tracking error results during the transients. This paper presents an improved way to coordinately control the five independent valves by incorporating the off-side pressure dynamics into the controller design. The Adaptive Robust Control technique is applied to guarantee the stability and tracking performance {{in the presence of}} large system parameter variations and disturbances.

40|$|The lack of {{position}} or velocity feedback {{is a very}} common problem particularly on construction equipment such as excavators and backhoes.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{innovative}} energy efficient fluid power systems for mobile applications. The subjects taken up concern {{to what extent}} and how energy losses can be reduced in mobile working hydraulics systems. Various measures are available for increasing energy efficiency {{in these kinds of}} systems. Examples include: Flow controlled systems The pump controller is switched from a load sensing toa displacement controlled one. The displacement is controlled in an open loopfashion directly from the operator’s demand signals. This reduces energy consumptionat the same time as dynamic issues that are attached to LS systemscan be avoided. Individual metering valve systems Flexibility is increased by removing the mechanicalcoupling between the <b>meter-in</b> and meter-out orifices in directionalvalves. An overview of this kind of system is given in the thesis. A designproposal that has been implemented is also presented. Initial test results areshown. Patents for this particular system have been applied for. Displacement control Metering losses are reduced by removing the directional valves. One pump is used for each load in such systems. This hardware layout involvesconsiderable changes compared to conventional systems. Displacementcontrolled systems are not studied in this work. In mobile applications, overall efficiency is often poor and losses are substantial. The measures listed above can help improve this significantly in such applications. A flow dividing system can decrease energy consumption by about 10 % and an individual metering system by about 20 %. Losses in pump controlled systems are difficult to give a figure for; the losses are rather attached to the pumps and motors and not to the system layout. However, the losses for these systems are presumably even lower than for individual metering systems. The main focus in this work is on individual metering systems but questions about which components and so on are also treated. For example, the Valvistor valve concept has been studied as part of this work. ...|$|E
40|$|As the {{applications}} of electro-hydraulic systems become increasingly widespread, {{the demand for}} low cost, high-level control performance and significant energy saving schemes gets stronger and stronger. The thesis proposes an intelligent mechatronics approach [...] -the integration of advanced control techniques with novel hardware reconfiguration and/or re-design [...] -to meet these industrial needs. The Purdue programmable valves; a unique configuration of five independently controlled poppet type cartridge valves, enable not only the decoupled <b>meter-in</b> and meter-out flow controls but also the precise control of the cross-port regeneration flow. When properly controlled, the increased hardware flexibility and controllability lead to significant energy-saving, due to the reduced working pressures and the full use of free regeneration flows. ^ However, the increased hardware flexibility also results in increased complexity in controlling such a multi-input-dual-objective system. A two-level coordinated control scheme is proposed in the thesis: the task-level configures the valve usage for maximal energy saving, and the valve-level utilizes Adaptive Robust Control (ARC) technique to guarantee the closed-loop system stability and performance under various model uncertainties and disturbances. Comparative experimental results were obtained to show the high-level control performance and significant energy saving achieved with the proposed low cost programmable valves. Relevant control issues, such as using the manufacturer supplied flow mappings and the deadband problem of electro-hydraulic systems, are discussed in detail in the thesis as well. ^ Lack of suitable mathematical model has limited the cartridge valve to low cost applications where precision motion control was not of major concern. The thesis proposes an on-board modeling approach to decompose and approximate the unknown valve flow mapping with some localized orthogonal basis functions. The weighting parameters of the basis functions {{as well as the}} unknown system parameters were then estimated simultaneously based on the pressure dynamics of the cylinder for regions where sufficient on-board measurement data were available. Experimental studies have been obtained to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method and the improvement of control performance with the estimated flow mappings. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a solution enabling lower losses in hydraulic actuator systems. A mobile fluid power system often contains several different actuators supplied {{with a single}} load sensing pump. One of the main advantages is the need of only one system pump. This makes the fluid power system compact and cost-effective. A hydraulic load often consists of two ports, e. g. motors and cylinders. Such loads have traditionally been controlled by a valve that controls these ports by one single control signal, namely {{the position of the}} spool in a control valve. In this kind of valve, the inlet (<b>meter-in)</b> and outlet (meter-out) orifices are mechanically connected. The mechanical connection makes the system robust and easy to control, {{at the same time as}} the system lacks flexibility. Some of the main drawbacks are The fixed relation between the inlet and outlet orifices in most applications produce too much throttling at the outlet orifice under most operating conditions. This makes the system inefficient. The flow directions are fixed for a given spool position; therefore, no energy recuperation and/or regeneration ability is available. In this thesis a novel system idea enabling, for example, recuperation and regeneration is presented. Recuperation is when flow is taken from a tank, pressurized by external loads, and then fed back into the pump line. Regeneration is when either cylinder chambers (or motor ports) are connected to the pump line. Only one system pump is needed. Pressure compensated (load independent), bidirectional, poppet valves are proposed and utilized. The novel system presented in this thesis needs only a position sensor on each compensator spool. This simple sensor is also suitable for identification of mode switches, e. g. between normal, differential and regenerative modes. Patent pending. The balance of where to put the functionality (hardware and/or software) makes it possible to manoeuvre the system with maintained speed control in the case of sensor failure. The main reason is that the novel system does not need pressure transducers for flow determination. Some features of the novel system: Mode switches The mode switches are accomplished without knowledge about the pressures in the system Throttle losses With the new system approach, choice of control and measure signals, the throttle losses at the control valves are reduced Smooth mode switches The system will switch to regenerative mode automatically in a smooth manner when possible Use energy stored in the loads The load, e. g. a cylinder, is able to be used as a motor when possible, enabling the system to recuperate overrun loads The system and its components are described together with the control algorithms that enable energy efficient operation. Measurements from a real application are also presented in the thesis...|$|E
