5|$|One {{mechanism}} {{involved in}} recovery is nerve terminal sprouting, in which remaining brainstem and spinal cord motor neurons develop new branches, or axonal sprouts. These sprouts can reinnervate orphaned <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers</b> {{that have been}} denervated by acute polio infection, restoring the fibers' capacity to contract and improving strength. Terminal sprouting may generate a few significantly enlarged motor neurons doing work previously performed {{by as many as}} four or five units: a single motor neuron that once controlled 200 muscle cells might control 800 to 1000 cells. Other mechanisms that occur during the rehabilitation phase, and contribute to muscle strength restoration, include myofiber hypertrophy—enlargement of <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers</b> through exercise and activity—and transformation of type II <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers</b> to type I <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{influence}} of the interposition of pink <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> into the dorsal ordinary muscle on the post-mortem temporal change of K-value, using carp (cultured) Cyprinus carpio, the dorsal muscle was divided into five muscle parts toward depth with the naked eye, as follows: the dark muscle part (P- 1), the intermediate muscle part (P- 2), and three ordinary muscle parts (P- 3, P- 4, P- 5). The <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> types in these parts were discriminated by the inactivation of actomyosin ATPase activity for both acid and alkaline preincubations, and the temporal changes of ATP related compounds in these parts were then measured at a kept temperature of 32 ℃. Five muscle parts were organized from the <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> types as follows: P- 1 was organized from only red <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> type, P- 2 from only pink <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> type in a thin layer and from two <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> types of not only pink <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber,</b> but also white <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> of the Ⅱa or Ⅱb subtype in a region of mosaic pattern, and all of P- 3, P- 4, and P- 5 were from two <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> types of white <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> (Ⅱa or Ⅱb subtype) and pink <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber,</b> respectively.

When ARIA isolated from chick embryo brain was applied to chicken myotubes, which are developing chicken <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers,</b> it was shown to increase the rate of insertion of acetylcholine receptors into chicken myotube membranes. This indicated ARIA could play a role in acetylcholine receptor insertion in neuromuscular junctions. Additionally, it was demonstrated that ARIA stimulated the transcription of α acetylcholine receptor subunits leading to an increase in α subunit messenger RNA (mRNA) and precursors, but had no effect on the mRNA levels of the γ or δ acetylcholine receptor subunits. This indicated that the amount α acetylcholine receptor subunit limits the synthesis and subsequent insertion of acetylcholine receptors into chicken myotube membranes.|$|E

40|$|The {{dependence}} of local left ventricular (LV) mechanics on myocardial <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> orientation was investigated using a finite element model. In the model we have considered anisotropy {{of the active}} and passive components of myocardial tissue, {{dependence of}} active stress on time, strain and strain rate, activation sequence of the LV wall and aortic afterload. <b>Muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> orientation in the LV wall is quantified by the helix fiber angle, defined as the angle between the <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> direction and the local circumferential direction. In a first simulation, a transmural variation of the helix fiber angle from + 60 degrees at the endocardium through 0 degrees in the midwall layers to - 60 degrees at the epicardium was assumed. In this simulation, at the equatorial level maximum active <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> stress was found to vary from about 110 kPa in the subendocardial layers through about 30 kPa in the midwall layers to about 40 kPa in the subepicardial layers. Next, {{in a series of}} simulations, <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> orientation was iteratively adapted until the spatial distribution of active <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> stress was fairly homogeneous. Using a transmural course of the helix fiber angle of + 60 degrees at the endocardium, + 15 degrees in the midwall layers and - 60 degrees at the epicardium, at the equatorial level maximum active <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> stress varied from 52 kPa to 55 kPa, indicating a remarkable reduction of the stress range. Moreover, the change of <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> strain with time was more similar {{in different parts of the}} LV wall than in the first simulation. It is concluded that (1) the distribution of active <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> stress and <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> strain across the LV wall is very sensitive to the transmural distribution of the helix fiber angle and (2) a physiological transmural distribution of the helix fiber angle can be found, at which active <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> stress and <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> strain are distributed approximately homogeneously across the LV wall...|$|R
40|$|With {{or without}} load, the {{properties}} of glycerinated <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> were observed in relation to varied concentrations of KCl or pyrophosphate. Under same experimental conditions, the effect of ATP on {{the properties of}} glycerinated <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> was studied. And relationship between relaxation of glycerinated <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> by high concentration of KC 1 and "derigor", and relationship between "derigor" and so-called "freeze up" phenomenon in glycerinated <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> were studied. The results are as follows : 1) Without load, glycerinated <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> shows two phases in optical and elastic properties in relation to KCl concentration. And under load, it shows 3 phases, i. e. inextensible, slight-extensible and strong-extensible. 2) Pyrophosphate has {{the same effect on}} glycerinated <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> as obtained by KC 1 in relation to its concentration. 3) The effect of ATP depends on the concentration of KC 1 or pyrophosphate. Without load, the property of glycerinated <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> is distinguished in 2 phases, i. e. contraction and inhibited contraction. And under the load, it is distinguished in 3 phases, i. e. contraction, contration followed relaxation and relaxation. 4) The influence of ATP concentration on the glycerinated <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> was also studied. 5) The influence of Mg annexation on ATP effect was studied. And the important significance of Mg ion on the actomyosin system was suggested. 6) Under load, the glycerinated <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> contracted by ATP solution can be relaxed by high concentration of KCl, while uncontracted glycerinated <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> can also be elongated by the same agent. These facts may be concidered as adequate experimental proof of the idea that boths state of the relaxation of contracted glycerinated <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> and of derigor belong to an equal molecular process, 7) Glycerinated <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> in rigor state can be brought into derigor state by many plasticizing agents, i. e.
