50|$|Destroying angels can {{be mistaken}} for edible fungi such as the button mushroom, <b>meadow</b> <b>mushroom,</b> or the horse mushroom. Young {{destroying}} angels that are still enclosed in their universal veil can {{be mistaken for}} puffballs, but slicing them in half longitudinally will reveal internal mushroom structures. This {{is the basis for}} the common recommendation to slice in half all puffball-like mushrooms picked when mushroom hunting. Mushroom hunters recommend that people know how to recognize both the death cap and the destroying angel in all of their forms before collecting any white gilled mushroom for consumption.|$|E
50|$|It {{is widely}} {{collected}} and eaten, even {{by those who}} would not normally eat wild mushrooms. This mushroom is not commercially cultivated on account of its fast maturing and short shelf-life.Culinary uses of the <b>meadow</b> <b>mushroom</b> include eating it sauteed or fried, in sauces, or even sliced raw and included in salads. In flavor and texture, this mushroom is almost identical to the white button mushroom available in grocery stores in the United States. Be sure to rinse well to dislodge any sand, and also watch out for small, white larvae which tunnel through the stems and caps. Among the similar species mentioned above, there have been cases (in fact {{the most common cause}} of fatal fungus poisoning in France) where the deadly toxic destroying angel (Amanita bisporigera) has been consumed by individuals who mistook it for this species. The edibility of specimens collected from lawns is uncertain because of possible contamination with pesticides or other chemicals.|$|E

50|$|During {{the late}} 1920s a company {{was formed to}} develop the flax {{industry}} on the extensive low-lying areas west of Morrinsville. Several thousand acres were acquired for the planting and milling of New Zealand flax (Phormium tenax), but prevailing economic conditions forced the early abandonment of the project. Most of this land has reverted to dairy farming or fat-lamb production, and the original English grasses used by earlier settlers have been replaced with higher producing Italian ryegrass and nitrogen-fixing white clover. During the town's formative years the area also contained a number of commercial sawmills, most of which closed by the 1930s as land was cleared for farming. <b>Meadow</b> <b>Mushrooms,</b> one of Morrinsville's biggest employers, ceased its local operations and relocated to Canterbury in 2010, with the subsequent loss of around 160 jobs.|$|R
