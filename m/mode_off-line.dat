40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the architecture of}} the Fault Analysis Software Tool (FAST). The tool identifies analytical redundancies from a reduced process description and use them to provide fault detection and isolation (FDI). In this form, the automated supervision of industrial processes is simplified. FAST can operate either stand alone in simulation <b>mode</b> (<b>off-line)</b> by reading the measured values from data files, or on-line connected to the process plant through an OPC interface. The OPC interface allows the tool to be connected to almost any process which features a SCADA system for supervisory control. When running in on-line mode, each process is monitored by a software agent. In case of a fault, FAST will detect it and will indicate the faulty device to the SCADA. The SCADA can display and record the fault allowing the implementation of early countermeasures. For some faults, FAST can also automatically reconfigure the process to temporarily avoid an emergency stop. This functionality is specially useful in systems with high level of autonomy, difficult access or for which maintenance operations cannot be immediately implemented. The objective of FAST is to provide to the industry a tool which can be used with a moderate level of complexity to apply FDI on top of the traditional process supervision.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} application of a system identification tech nique called pseudo-linear identification (PLID). PLID is a discrete-time, multi-input, multi-output (MEMO), state space, simultaneous parameter estimator and one step ahead state predictor of linear time invariant systems. No measurements are assumed perfect under PLED; that is the inputs and outputs are allowed to have zero mean white gaussian (ZMWG) additive noise. Furthermore, the states are also assumed to have additive ZMWG noise. Like most system identification techniques, PLED requires the system to be completely controllable and observable under the given actuator and sensor suite. The only firm assumption made on model structure is that the transfer function be strictly proper; that is, the frequency response is bounded and tends towards zero as frequency is in creased to infinity. Pole and zero locations are not confined; indeed, unstable systems can be identified, and furthermore, they can be controlled because PLED provides simultaneous one step ahead state predictions. Developed by Hopkins et. al. in 1988 [1], this method has seen little application (due in part to its youth); however, it {{is shown in the}} following pages to be a powerful technique for performing state space system identification, as well as on-line model order reduction. The experiment involves applying PLED to a 3 -Dimensional (3 -D) kinematic truss structure (referred to here forward as the 2 ̆ 2 testbed 2 ̆ 2) in a batch <b>mode</b> (<b>off-line).</b> Batch mode identification, by definition, implies that the testbed does not change appreciably between the time it was identified and the time it will be controlled. For most kinematic structures, this is true. PLED can be used for real-time (on-line) system identification. However, due to the complexity of typical structures (e. g., flexible mechanical systems), and the high bandwidth of control (hundreds of hertz), this is not possible with current personal computer (PC) based controllers. Ultimately, the state space model generated by PLED will be used to design a closed loop controller for the testbed that will increase its damping twenty fold, from approximately 0. 25...|$|E

AGCM predictions of overall soil moisture change are in broad agreement but disagree sharply in some regions. Intercomparison projects have sought to evaluate the LSSs used by AGCMs for both accuracy and consistency. These {{studies have found that}} different LSSs can produce very different simulations even when supplied with identical atmospheric forcing. As well, LSSs that produce similar surface results from present-day or control climates often diverge when forced with climatic change data. Furthermore, no single LSS has been identified that produces an adequate simulation of all of temperature, moisture, evapotranspiration and runoff. AGCM LSSs must resolve the surface energy balance (SEB) in order to compute realistic heat fluxes between with the atmospheric model.

40|$|Abstract. The Monadic Constraint Programming {{framework}} leverages Haskell’s rich static type {{system and}} powerful abstraction mechanisms to implement an embedded domain specific language (EDSL) for constraint programming. In this paper we {{show how the}} same constraint model expressed in the EDSL can be processed in various modes by external constraint solvers. We distinguish between on-line and off-line use of solvers. In <b>off-line</b> <b>mode,</b> the model is not solved; instead it is compiled to lower-level code that will search for solutions when compiled and run. For on-line use, the search can be handled by either the framework or in the external solver. <b>Off-line</b> <b>mode</b> requires recompilation after each change to the model. To avoid repeated recompilation, we separate model from data by means of parameters that need not be known at compile time. Parametrization poses several challenges, which we resolve by embedding the EDSL more deeply. ...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{adaptive control}} algorithms for conventional {{modes of operation}} of MEMS z-axis gyroscopes. In an open-loop <b>mode,</b> an <b>off-line</b> self-calibration scheme is proposed for estimating fabrication imperfections and enhancing {{the performance of a}} gyroscope operating in open-loop mode. This scheme can be implemented during the initial calibration stage when the gyroscope is turned on, or at regular calibration sessions, which may be performed periodically. An adaptive add-on control scheme is also proposed for a closed-loop mode of operation. This scheme is realized by adding an outer loop to a conventional force-balancing scheme that includes a parameter estimation algorithm. This parameter adaptation algorithm estimates the angular rate, identifies and compensates the quadrature error, and may permit on-line automatic mode tuning. The convergence and resolution analysis show that the proposed adaptive add-on control scheme prevents the angular rate estimate from being contaminated by the quadrature error, while keeping ideal resolution performance of a conventional force-balancing scheme. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} a new version of Fuzzy ARTMAP neural network named ordered fuzzy artmap for evaluating on-line short term load forecasting. Fuzzy ARTMAP can operate in <b>off-line</b> or on-line <b>modes.</b> In the on-line mode, the network must process the data as it becomes available, without storing or reusing it. In the <b>off-line</b> <b>mode,</b> the data can be stored and repeatedly presented to the network. In this paper, we consider the off-line operation of fuzzy ARTMAP in classification inputs and then used this classified input to forecast daily load of power network. In particular, we consider one of the major limitations of fuzzy ARTMAP, its dependence on tuning parameters. The performance of fuzzy ARTMAP depends on the values of two parameters called the choice and vigilance parameters, and also on the order of pattern presentation for the <b>off-line</b> <b>mode</b> of training. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed neural network, short term load forecasting is performed on the IRAN power system. Test results indicate that the special neural network is very effective in improving the accuracy of the forecast hourly loads.

The mass-flux or top-hat characteristics of the reactive flow are determined. Also, several mass-flux schemes are run in an <b>off-line</b> <b>mode,</b> that is, with prescribed profiles of the mass flux and the updraft area fraction, and are compared to the LES. Top-hat approximations are found to capture about 25 % of the covariance between two arbitrary (nonreacting or reacting) scalars and about 65 % of the flux. Subplume fluxes are located either in the updraft for bottom-up diffusing scalars or in the downdraft for top-down diffusing scalars. The mass-flux scheme that is nearly identical to the exact plume-budget equations gives the best performance. For the parameterization of lateral exchange this mass-flux scheme includes gross exchange across the interface between updrafts and downdrafts, that is, includes also subinterface-scale exchange processes (like the other dynamical quantities also prescribed in an <b>off-line</b> <b>mode</b> using LES data). A simpler mass-flux scheme, which {{does not include the}} more sophisticated parame-terizations of subplume fluxes and subinterface-scale lateral exchange, is found to perform only slightly worse.
