Established acquired causes include serious brain trauma, stroke, tumours and problems in the brain {{as a result of}} a previous infection. In about 60% of cases the cause is unknown. Epilepsies caused by genetic, congenital, or developmental conditions are <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>among</b> younger people, while brain tumors and strokes are more likely in older people.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 9 to 12% {{of people}} (632million) have LBP {{at any given}} point in time, and nearly 25% report having it at some point over any one-month period. About 40% of people have LBP {{at some point in}} their lives, with {{estimates}} as high as 80% among people in the developed world. Difficulty most often begins between 20 and 40years of age. Men and women are equally affected. Low back pain is <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>among</b> people aged 4080years, with the overall number of individuals affected expected to increase as the population ages.|$|E
5|$|Genetics {{play a role}} in the {{development}} of COPD. It is <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>among</b> relatives of those with COPD who smoke than unrelated smokers. Currently, the only clearly inherited risk factor is alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (AAT). This risk is particularly high if someone deficient in alpha 1-antitrypsin also smokes. It is responsible for about 1–5% of cases and the condition is present in about 3–4 in 10,000 people. Other genetic factors are being investigated, of which there are likely to be many.|$|E

5|$|The gesture {{dates back}} to Ancient Greece {{and it was also}} used in Ancient Rome. Historically, it {{represented}} the phallus. In some modern cultures, it has gained increasing recognition as a sign of disrespect, and has been used by music artists (notably <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>among</b> hardcore punk bands and rappers), actors, celebrities, athletes, and politicians. Most still view the gesture as obscene. The index finger and ring finger besides the middle finger in more contemporary periods has been likened to represent the testicles.|$|E
5|$|The various nicknames {{associated}} with prepatellar bursitis {{arise from the}} fact that it commonly occurs among those individuals whose professions require frequent kneeling, such as carpenters, carpet layers, gardeners, housemaids, mechanics, miners, plumbers, and roofers. The exact incidence of the condition is not known; it is difficult to estimate because only severe septic cases require hospital admission, and mild non-septic cases generally go unreported. Prepatellar bursitis is <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>among</b> males than females. It affects all age groups, but is more likely to be septic when it occurs in children.|$|E

India had the largest total incidence, with an estimated 2.0 million new cases. In developed countries, tuberculosis is less common and is found mainly in urban areas. Rates per 100,000 people in different areas of the world were: globally 178, Africa 332, the Americas 36, Eastern Mediterranean 173, Europe 63, Southeast Asia 278, and Western Pacific 139 in 2010. In Canada and Australia, tuberculosis is many times <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>among</b> the aboriginal peoples, especially in remote areas.

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} which comorbidities are <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in patients with urinary incontinence compared with patients without this diagnosis. DESIGN OF STUDY: Case-control study. SETTING/METHODS: The data for this study were obtained from the Second Dutch National Survey of General Practice (DNSGP- 2) performed in 2001 and were extracted from the electronic medical records of all patients registered in the participating practices in the year of study (2001). Conditional logistic regression was performed using the PHREG (proportional hazards regression) procedure. RESULTS: Urinary tract infections, constipation, and depression were more prevalent in both men and women with urinary incontinence than in controls. In men, heart failure is <b>more</b> <b>common</b> than <b>among</b> controls, and in women, diabetes mellitus, genitourinary prolapse, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) /asthma are <b>more</b> <b>common</b> than <b>among</b> controls. CONCLUSION: General practitioners could ask for the presence of urinary incontinence in patients with the above described comorbidities. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
5|$|Low {{back pain}} that lasts {{at least one}} day and limits {{activity}} is a common complaint. Globally, about 40% of people have LBP {{at some point in their}} lives, with estimates as high as 80% of people in the developed world. Approximately 9 to 12% of people (632million) have LBP at any given point in time, and nearly one quarter (23.2%) report having it at some point over any one-month period.

5|$|OCD is a {{relatively}} rare disorder, with an estimated incidence of 15 to 30 cases per 100,000 persons per year. Widuchowski W et al. found OCD to {{be the cause of}} articular cartilage defects in 2% of cases in a study of 25,124 knee arthroscopies. Although rare, OCD is noted as an important cause of joint pain in active adolescents. The juvenile form of the disease occurs in children with open growth plates, usually between the ages 5 and 15 years and occurs more commonly in males than females, with a ratio between 2:1 and 3:1. However, OCD has become <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>among</b> adolescent females as they become more active in sports. The adult form, which occurs in those who have reached skeletal maturity, is most commonly found in people 16 to 50 years old.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1927 season, Yorkshire secretary Frederick Toone approached Wilfred Rhodes to suggest that he should resign from his position as senior professional. Rhodes declined, prompted by his wife's suspicion of a plot against him. This may have been an attempt by Yorkshire to clear the way for a new captain. Lord Hawke was in favour of appointing Herbert Sutcliffe, a professional who had opened the batting for Yorkshire since 1919. In addition to Rhodes, other professionals on the side had debuted for Yorkshire earlier than Sutcliffe. However, Sutcliffe was unusual among professionals: he had received a commission in the British Army in the First World War, his appearance was always immaculate and when speaking he altered his accent to fit what he considered a better class of society. Such characteristics were <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>among</b> amateur cricketers, and Sutcliffe in many ways behaved like one. While not particularly popular with his teammates, he was respected.|$|E

5|$|Brood parasitism, {{in which}} an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual's brood, is <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>among</b> birds than {{any other type of}} organism. After a {{parasitic}} bird lays her eggs in another bird's nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host {{at the expense of the}} host's own brood. Brood parasites may be either obligate brood parasites, which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or non-obligate brood parasites, which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young. One hundred bird species, including honeyguides, icterids, and ducks, are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the cuckoos. Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host's young, which allows them to destroy the host's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host's chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.|$|E
5|$|Teleosts {{have four}} major life stages: the egg, the larva, the {{juvenile}} and the adult. Species may begin {{life in a}} pelagic environment or a demersal environment (near the seabed). Most marine teleosts have pelagic eggs, which are light, transparent and buoyant with thin envelopes. Pelagic eggs rely on the ocean currents to disperse and receive no parental care. When they hatch, the larvae are planktonic and unable to swim. They have a yolk sac attached to them which provides nutrients. Most freshwater species produce demersal eggs which are thick, pigmented, relatively heavy and able to stick to substrates. Parental care is much <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>among</b> freshwater fish. Unlike their pelagic counterparts, demersal larvae are able to swim and feed {{as soon as they}} hatch. Larval teleosts often look very different from adults, particularly in marine species. Some larvae were even considered different species from the adults. Larvae have high mortality rates, most die from starvation or predation within their first week. As they grow, survival rates increase and there is greater physiological tolerance and sensitivity, ecological and behavioural competence.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Iodine is an {{essential}} nutrient needed for the synthesis of hormone thyroxin. Hormone thyroxin {{is involved in the}} metabolism of several nutrients, the regulation of enzymes and differentiation of cells, tissues and organs. Iodine deficiency (ID) impairs the development of the brain and nervous system. It affects cognitive capacity, educability, productivity and child mortality. ID hinders physical strength and causes reproductive failure. The objective {{of this paper is to}} explore if the health impacts of ID are <b>more</b> <b>common</b> and severe <b>among</b> women. Design: Using primary data (notes from a visit) and secondary data, this paper examines if the effects of ID are <b>more</b> <b>common</b> and severe <b>among</b> Oromo women inEthiopia. Findings: The health im pacts of ID are <b>more</b> <b>common</b> and severe <b>among</b> women. Conclusions: ID is an easily preventable nutritional problem. In Oromia, the persistence of ID is explained by the Ethiopian gov ernment’s colonial social policies. Preventing ID should be seen as part of the efforts we make to enhance capacity building, promote health, gender equity and social justice. Implications: I odine deficiency has a wide range of biological, social, economic and cultural im pacts. Preventing ID can be instrumental in bringing about gender equity and building the capacity of people. </p...|$|R
