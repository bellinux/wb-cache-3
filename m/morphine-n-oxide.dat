50|$|<b>Morphine-N-oxide</b> (genomorphine) is {{an active}} opioid {{metabolite}} of morphine. Morphine itself, in trials with rats, acts 11-22 times more potent than <b>morphine-N-oxide</b> subcutaneously and 39-89 times more potent intraperitoneally. However, pretreatment with amiphenazole or tacrine increases the potency of <b>morphine-N-oxide</b> in relation to morphine (intraperitoneally {{more so than in}} subcutaneous administration). A possible explanation is that <b>morphine-N-oxide</b> is rapidly inactivated in the liver and impairment of inactivation processes or enzymes increases functionality.|$|E
50|$|<b>Morphine-N-Oxide</b> has a DEA ACSCN of 9307 {{and annual}} {{production}} quota of 655 grammes in 2013. It is a Schedule I controlled substance in the US.|$|E

50|$|Closely {{related to}} {{morphine}} are the opioids <b>morphine-N-oxide</b> (genomorphine), {{which is a}} pharmaceutical {{that is no longer}} in common use; and pseudomorphine, an alkaloid that exists in opium, form as degradation products of morphine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Morphine-N-oxide</b> {{can also}} form as a {{decomposition}} product of morphine outside {{the body and}} may show up in assays of opium and poppy straw concentrate. Codeine and the semi-synthetics such as heroin, dihydrocodeine, dihydromorphine, hydromorphone, and hydrocodone also have equivalent amine oxide derivatives.|$|E
50|$|Like <b>morphine-N-oxide,</b> it was {{studied as}} a {{potential}} pharmaceutical drug and is considerably weaker than codeine. The amine oxides of this type form as oxidation products of the parent chemical; virtually every morphine/codeine class opioid has an equivalent nitrogen derivative such as hydromorphone-N-oxide.|$|E
40|$|International audienceMorphine {{and several}} other opioids are {{important}} drugs {{for the treatment of}} acute and chronic pain. Opioid-induced analgesia is predominantly mediated by the μ-opioid receptor (MOR). When administered to humans, complex metabolic pathways lead to generation of many metabolites, nine of which may be considered major metabolites. While the properties of the two main compounds, morphine- 6 -glucuronide and morphine- 3 -glucuronide, are well described, the activity of other morphine metabolites is largely unknown. Here we performed an extensive pharmacological characterization by comparing efficacies and potencies of morphine and its nine major metabolites for the two main signaling pathways engaged by the human MOR, which occur via G-protein activation and β-arrestins, respectively. We used radioligand binding studies and FRET-based methods to monitor MOR-mediated G-protein activation and β-arrestin recruitment in single intact 293 T cells. This approach identified two major groups of morphine metabolites, which we classified into "strong" and "weak" receptor ligands. Strong partial agonists morphine, morphine- 6 -glucuronide, normorphine, morphine- 6 -sulfate, 6 -acetylmorphine and 3 -acetylmorphine showed efficacies in the nanomolar range, while the weak metabolites <b>morphine-N-oxide,</b> morphine- 3 -sulfate, morphine- 3 -glucuronide and pseudomorphine activated MOR pathways only in the micromolar range. Interestingly, three metabolites, normorphine, 6 -acetylmorphine and morphine- 6 -glucuronide, had lower potencies for Gi-protein activation but higher potencies and efficacies for β-arrestin recruitment than morphine itself, suggesting that they are biased towards β-arrestin pathways...|$|E
