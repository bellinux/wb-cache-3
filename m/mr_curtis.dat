Lewis and moved to Denver the following year, where she would concentrate on painting and where she remained until her death in 1929. In her absence, the pottery fell under financial hardships and was sold at sheriff's auction; later it was re-sold, once more becoming the property of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Curtis.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Grace was [...] "notoriously unscholarly". His first {{schooling}} {{was with}} a Miss Trotman in Downend village {{and then with a}} <b>Mr</b> <b>Curtis</b> of Winterbourne. He subsequently attended a day school called Ridgway House, run by a Mr Malpas, until he was fourteen. One of his schoolmasters, David Barnard, later married Grace's sister Alice. In 1863, Grace was taken seriously ill with pneumonia and his father removed him from Ridgway House. After this illness, Grace grew rapidly to his full height of 6ft 2 in (1.88 m). He continued his education at home where one of his tutors was the Reverend John Dann, who was the Downend parish church curate; like Mr Barnard before him, Mr Dann became Grace's brother-in-law, marrying Blanche Grace in 1869.|$|E

60|$|To {{support the}} slow sale of ‘The Flora Londinensis,’ <b>Mr.</b> <b>Curtis,</b> about 1787, started ‘The Botanical Magazine,’ which {{became one of}} the popular {{periodicals}} of the day, and Dr. Smith’s and Mr. Sowerby’s ‘English Botany’ was modelled after it.|$|E
60|$|Nearly {{opposite}} to Pelham Crescent is POND PLACE, where <b>Mr.</b> <b>Curtis,</b> the eminent botanist, of whom more hereafter, {{died on the}} 7th July, 1799; and a little further on, {{on the same side}} of the way, appears Chelsea New Church, dedicated to St. Luke.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, my dear," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Curtis,</b> evidently distressed, [...] "I {{think the}} {{exertion}} {{would be good}} for you, if you could only think so." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Curtis</b> was {{infinitely}} rejoiced to {{find her}} entrance thus inopportune. [...] "I only wished {{just to be sure}} it was not too much," [...] she said.|$|R

6000|$|... "I cannot {{tell you}} exactly, sir. There were twenty-five killed {{on board the}} Cerf, in {{addition}} to Mr. Playford and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Curtis.</b> The two officers and about half the men were, Mr. Glover reported, killed by the explosion, which, as you see, dismasted her." ...|$|E

60|$|Gowanbrae had two drawing-rooms with folding doors between, quite {{practicable}} for dancing, and {{the further}} one {{ending in a}} conservatory, that likewise extended along {{the end of the}} entrance hall and dining-room. The small library, where Colonel Keith usually sat, became the cloak-room, and contained, when <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Curtis</b> and her daughters arrived, so large a number of bright cashmere cloaklets, scarlet, white, and blue, that they began to sigh prospectively at the crowd which, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Curtis</b> would have encountered with such joyful valour save for that confidence {{on the way home from}} the book club.|$|R
60|$|Miss Wellwood {{intended}} {{going out}} to join her old friend; but, on {{going to put on}} her bonnet, she saw from the window <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Curtis,</b> leaning on the intruder's arm, conversing so confidentially that the Dean's sister flushed with amazement, and only hoped she had mentioned him with due respect. And under that southern cathedral wall good <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Curtis</b> took the longest walk she had indulged in for the last twenty years, so that Grace, and even Rachel, beholding from the window, began to fear that the mother would be walked to death.|$|R
6000|$|... "So do I indeed, sir. Mr. Playford was an {{excellent}} officer, and as good a fellow as ever walked. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Curtis</b> would have made, I am sure, a good officer in time. I hardly thought he would when he first joined, but he was improving greatly, and he showed great courage in working to remove the boom under a very heavy fire from the pirates, which sunk his boat under him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is {{some work}} for you, Dr. Bemish," [...] the captain said. [...] "Mr. Playford reports that {{ten of the}} cases are serious. I am going ashore in my gig at once, and will take you with me. You had better send the cutter at once, Mr. Hill, to bring off the wounded.

6000|$|The {{botanical garden}} of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Curtis,</b> {{as a public}} resort for study, was {{continued}} at Brompton until 1808, when the lease of the land being nearly expired, Mr. Salisbury, who in 1792 became his pupil, and in 1798 his partner in this horticultural speculation, removed the establishment to the vacant space of ground now inclosed between Sloane Street and Cadogan Place, where Mr. Salisbury’s undertaking failed.

6000|$|... "I {{hope she}} was not knocked up by the long night journey all at one stretch. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Curtis</b> was very uneasy about it, but nothing would move her; she owned that Alick did not expect her, for she had taken care he should not object, by saying nothing of her intention, but she was sure he would be ill on Wednesday morning, and then <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Curtis</b> not only gave in directly, but all we married women turned upon poor Grace for hinting that Alick might prefer a day's solitary illness to her being over-tired." ...|$|R

60|$|Opposite to York Place was a fine, open, airy {{piece of}} ground to which <b>Mr.</b> <b>Curtis,</b> the eminent naturalist, removed his botanical garden from Lambeth Marsh, {{as a more}} {{desirable}} locality. Upon the south-east portion of this nursery-ground the first stone was laid by H.R.H. Prince Albert, on the 11th July, 1844, of an hospital for consumption and diseases of the chest, and which was speedily surrounded by houses on all sides; probably a circumstance not contemplated {{at the time the}} ground was secured.|$|E
6000|$|... [*--This single-barrelled percussion-cap rifle {{described}} by [...] Allan Quatermain, which figures so {{prominently in the}} [...] history of this epoch of his life, has been sent to me by [...] <b>Mr.</b> <b>Curtis,</b> and is before me as I write. It {{was made in the}} [...] year 1835 by J. Purdey, of 314 1/2, Oxford Street, London, [...] and is a beautiful piece of workmanship of its kind. Without [...] the ramrod, which is now missing, it weighs only 5 lbs. 3 [...] 3/4 oz. The barrel is octagonal, and the rifled bore, [...] designed to take a spherical bullet, is 1/2 in. in diameter. [...] The hammer can be set to safety on the half-cock by means of [...] a catch behind it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perky don't {{practise}} as she preaches," [...] whispered Belle to Polly, as Miss P. became {{absorbed in}} the chat of her other neighbors. [...] "She pays her chamber girl with old finery; and the other day, when Betsey was out parading in her missis's cast-off purple plush suit, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Curtis</b> thought she was mademoiselle, and bowed to her. He is as blind as a bat, but recognized the dress, and pulled off his hat {{to it in the}} most elegant style. Perky adores him, and was mad enough to beat Betsey when she told the story and giggled over it. Betsey is quite as stylish and ever so much prettier than Perky, and she knows it, which is an aggravation." ...|$|E
