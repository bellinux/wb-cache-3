5|$|Neither the mutiny nor {{the popular}} {{uprising}} came entirely {{as a surprise}} to the French authorities. The colonial government's first large scale crackdown on the VNQDD in 1929 had substantially damaged the party, which had modelled itself on the Chinese Kuomintang of Chiang Kai-shek. The crackdown also had the effect of increasing the violent tendencies within what remained of the VNQDĐ. Its remaining leadership was now willing to intensify preparations for a violent overthrow of colonial rule to create an independent Vietnamese republic. Most of the party's leadership ranks, but not its lower-ranking members and affiliates, seem to have concluded that they were too weak and too closely spied on by the Sûreté to have a meaningful chance of success. At the <b>most</b> <b>optimistic,</b> they could hope to trigger a spontaneous uprising; at the worst, the subsequent French reprisals would transform them into anti-colonial martyrs. Finally, there was disagreement or a communication problem over the timing of the insurrection: after Hoc had ordered the postponement of the mutiny, Nhu still proceeded.|$|E
5|$|Since it {{can take}} decades of {{studying}} climate change and tracking bee colonies to find correlations between them, many researchers have turned to ecological modeling. In a Brazilian study, researchers investigated the impact that climate change will have on ten endemic bee species in various future climatic scenarios. It is known that moderate temperatures and high relative humidity impacts flight activity and foraging behavior in bee species such as Melipona and Centris. As a result, the scientists predict that in scenarios where temperatures continue to increase and humidity continues to decrease the only suitable climates for bees in Brazil {{will be in the}} more mountainous environments. The <b>most</b> <b>optimistic</b> scenario estimated climate change would still lead to a five percent reduction in these species’ populations. While this may not seem like a large change, bees are very sensitive to the effects of small population size; small populations can lead to reduced genetic variability and decreased fitness. As a result of this sensitivity, fragmented habitat are less likely to support a viable population and may lead to additional colony collapse.|$|E

25|$|The {{importance}} {{of how a}} woman perceives her behavior should not be underestimated. Many women perceived sex as a chore {{as opposed to a}} pleasurable experience, and they tend to consider themselves sexually inadequate, which in turn does not motivate them to engage in sexual activity. Several factors influence a women's perception of her sexual life. These can include: race, her gender, ethnicity, educational background, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, financial resources, culture, and religion. Cultural differences are also present in how women view menopause and its impact on health, self-image, and sexuality. A study has found that African American women are the <b>most</b> <b>optimistic</b> about menopausal life; Caucasian women are the most anxious, Asian women are the most inhibited about their symptoms, and Hispanic women are the most stoic.|$|E

25|$|The RER plan {{initially}} {{included one}} east-west line and two north-south lines.

The new line created by this merger became lineA. The Ligne de Sceaux, which served the southern suburbs and was bought by the CMP in the 1930s, would be extended north to merge with a line of the SNCF and reach the new Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport in Roissy. This became lineB. These new lines were inaugurated in 1977 and their wild success outperformed all the <b>most</b> <b>optimistic</b> forecasts to the extent that line A is the most used urban rail line in the world with nearly 300million journeys a year.|$|E
