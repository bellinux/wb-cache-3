25|$|Upon heating orthophosphoric acid, {{condensation}} of the phosphoric units can {{be induced}} by driving {{off the water}} formed from condensation. When one molecule of water has been removed for each two molecules of phosphoric acid, the result is pyrophosphoric acid (H4P2O7). When an average of one molecule of water per phosphoric unit has been driven off, the resulting substance is a glassy solid having an empirical formula of HPO3 and is called <b>metaphosphoric</b> <b>acid.</b> <b>Metaphosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> is a singly anhydrous version of orthophosphoic acid and is sometimes used as a water- or moisture-absorbing reagent. Further dehydrating is very difficult and can be accomplished only {{by means of an}} extremely strong desiccant (and not by heating alone). It produces phosphoric anhydride (phosphorus pentoxide), which has an empirical formula P2O5, although an actual molecule has a chemical formula of P4O10. Phosphoric anhydride is a solid, which is very strongly moisture-absorbing and is used as a desiccant.|$|E
50|$|In a few cases, the prefixes ortho- and para- {{occur in}} names of some oxoacids and their {{derivative}} anions. In such cases, the para- acid is {{what can be}} thought as remaining of the ortho- acid if a water molecule is separated from the ortho- acid molecule. For example, phosphoric acid, H3PO4, has sometimes been called orthophosphoric acid, in order to distinguish it from <b>metaphosphoric</b> <b>acid,</b> HPO3. However, according to IUPAC's current rules, the prefix ortho- should only be used in names of orthotelluric acid and orthoperiodic acid, and their corresponding anions and salts.|$|E
50|$|The {{phosphoric acid}} units can be bonded {{together}} in rings (cyclic structures) forming <b>metaphosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> molecules. The simplest such compound is trimetaphosphoric acid or cyclo-triphosphoric acid having the formula H3P3O9. Its structure {{is shown in}} the illustration. Since the ends are condensed, its formula has one less H2O (water) than tripolyphosphoric acid. What are commonly called trimetaphosphates actually have a mixture of ring sizes. A general formula for such cyclic compounds is (HPO3)x where x = number of phosphoric units in the molecule. The hypothetical monomer monometaphosphoric acid (HPO3), which would be valence isoelectronic with nitric acid, is not known to exist.|$|E
50|$|Metaphosphates can be {{considered}} as salts of the corresponding <b>metaphosphoric</b> <b>acids</b> (HnPnO3n) although none of these acids has been isolated.

40|$|Evaluation of an acidic deproteinization for the {{measurement}} of ascorbate and dehydroascorbate in plasma samples Ichiro Koshiishi, Yoshie Mamura, Ji Liu, and Toshio Imanari* The most popular pretreatment method of plasma samples for {{the measurement}} of ascorbate (AsA) and dehydroascorbate (DHA) has been an acidic deproteinization via <b>metaphosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> or trichloroacetic acid. In general, DHA is absent in plasma samples prepared from human blood in a conventional manner. However, when these plasma samples were subjected to acidic deproteinization, DHA was detected in the acidified sample solutions. In the present study, we demonstrate that the oxidation of AsA to DHA in the solutions was promoted by at least two mechanisms, one involving catalysis by ferric ion released from transferrin, and the other involving catalysis by plasma hemoglobin. In the acidified transferrin solution by trichloroacetic acid, an oxidation of AsA to DHA proceeded with standing time, whereas the oxidation was not observed in that by <b>metaphosphoric</b> <b>acid.</b> This oxidation appeared to be catalyzed by ferric ion released from transferrin. In contrast, plasma hemoglobin functioned {{as a catalyst for}} AsA oxidation in both <b>metaphosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> and trichloroacetic acid solutions. Therefore, DHA content in the trichloroacetic acid-treated plasma sample was markedly higher than that in the metaphosphoric acid-treated one. These results suggest that DHA detected in acidified plasma samples is an artifact resulting from AsA oxidation...|$|E

Stability of MPA, MPAG and AcMPAG in acidified and non-acidified plasma stored at room temperature, 4 degrees C, - 20 degrees C and - 80 degrees C was assessed over short and long time intervals using HPLC-UV methodology. RESULTS: The area ratio of AcMPAG/IS on spiked plasma at pH 2. 5 with method A was 63 % of the respective ratio in water, in contrast to 102 % with method B, suggesting partial deconjugation and/or incomplete release of AcMPAG from proteins with method A. At room temperature, AcMPAG concentrations in both whole blood and non-acidified plasma decreased significantly after 2 - 5 h. MPA, MPAG and AcMPAG concentrations remained stable in acidified plasma stored at - 20 degrees C and - 80 degrees C, but not longer than 5 months after collection.

The LC-extraction method using 3 % metaphosphoric acid- 8 % acetic acid shows high mean recoveries (99 ± 6 %) for all matrices assayed, while the LC-extraction method with 0. 1 % oxalic acid proved to be unacceptable in some cases (unripe, half ripe and ripe banana and ripe mango) obtaining mean recoveries of 39. 9 ± 9. 1 % and 72 ± 13 % for banana and mango, respectively. The detection limit achieved with the metaphosphoric acid-acetic acid LC-extraction method for ascorbic acid (0. 1 mg/l) allowed the determination of this vitamin in fruits analysed with good precision (5. 94 - 12. 8 %), making its use as a routine analysis method perfectly valid. Recommendations about storage temperature, methods of thawing L-ascorbic acid extracts and the addition of antioxidants to extracts were made.

40|$|Summary: Iron {{is a vital}} element {{for almost}} all living organisms. In mammals iron is taken by the {{intestinal}} epithelium, primarily in the duodenum. The initial step of absorption involves the reduction of ferric to ferrous iron both in gastric lumen and at the brush-border apical membrane. Reductase activity is increased by factors physiologically stimulating iron absorption, such as iron deficiency and chronic hypoxia. Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) {{has long been known}} to enhance absorption of dietary iron in humans as shown by several nutritional/dietetic studies. This effect has been ascribed to lumenal reduction and solubilization of iron. Recent molecular cloning of the mammalian duodenal brush-border reductase activity has provided evidence that ascorbate may play an intracellular role in determining iron absorption rates. Previously, ascorbate concentrations have been determined in duodenum, but only in normal subjects and there is no evidence on how duodenal ascorbate alters in relation to intestinal iron absorption. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine mucosal and plasma levels of ascorbate and dehydroascorbate in normal subjects and patients with iron deficiency that is known to be a stimulator for iron absorption. Duodenal biopsies were homogenized in 5 % <b>metaphosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> using single burst homogeniser. Tissue and plasma ascorbate levels were assayed by ferrozine spectrophotometric method. Blood was taken from each subject to assess the iron status. The analyses of human samples revealed increased duodenal (p < 0. 001, n = 20) and plasma (p < 0. 001, n = 6) ascorbate levels in patients with iron deficiency. These findings suppor...|$|E
30|$|Thiobarbituric acid-reactive {{substances}} (TBARS) were assayed in {{the plasma}} and the tissue extracts at 532  nm {{by using a}} 2 -thiobarbituric acid (2, 6 -dihydroxypyrimidine- 2 -thiol, TBA). An extinction coefficient of 156, 000  M−[*] 1  cm−[*] 1 was used for calculation (Esterbauer and Cheeseman, 1990). Reduced glutathione content was assayed by the method of Beutler, Duron, and Kelly (1963). The method utilized <b>metaphosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> for protein precipitation and 5, 5 -dithiobis (2 -nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) for color development and its density was measured at 412  nm. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST; EC 2.5. 1.18) catalyzes the conjugation reaction with glutathione in {{the first step of}} mercapturic acid synthesis. The activity of GST was measured according to the method of Habig, Pabst, and Jakoby (1974). P-nitrobenzylchloride was used as substrate. The absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 310  nm using UV-Double Beam Spectrophotometer (Model: Evolution 300 UV-Vis, USA). The catalase enzyme (CAT; EC 1.11. 1.6) converts H 2 O 2 into water. The CAT activity in plasma and tissue extracts was measured spectrophotometrically at 240  nm by calculating the rate of degradation of H 2 O 2, the substrate of the enzyme (Xu, Yuan, & Lang, 1997). Superoxide dismutase (SOD; EC 1.15. 1.1) was assayed according to Misra and Fridovich (1972). The assay procedure involves the inhibition of epinephrine autooxidation in an alkaline medium (pH 10.2) to adrenochrome, which is markedly inhibited by the presence of SOD. Epinephrine was added to the assay mixture, containing tissue supernatant and the change in extinction coefficient was followed at 480  nm in a spectrophotometer. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx; EC 1.1. 1.9) activity was assayed using the method of Chiu, Stults, and Tappel (1976).|$|E
