40|$|Abstract: The paper {{stems from}} an {{assessment}} of the suitability of bond graphs for modelling mechanical systems. Although mathematically rigorous, difficulties arise with intuitive interpretation of bond graphs. The source of the difficulty is the semantics commonly adopted and the way that they relate to traditional interpretations of mechanical system dynamics. Bond graphs represent dynamic systems as energy manipulators with the flow of energy given by the product of two power variables, commonly described as the flow and effort variables. In the mechanical domain, velocity is commonly described as the flow variable, and force as the effort variable. The physical interpretation of mechanical systems and the analogies across systems domains are much improved if force is adopted as the flow variable and the second power variable (i. e. velocity) is called the potential variable. Force can be represented as the flow of a <b>mechanical</b> <b>charge,</b> where the total charge stored in a mass is equal to its momentum. It displays all the properties of a flow variable. Mass is then analogous to electrical capacitance, and mechanical compliance is analogous to electrical inductance...|$|R

This results in an analytical estimation of the potential solutions to excessive gate leakage current. The energy quantization analysis involves the derivation of a quantum <b>mechanical</b> <b>charge</b> distribution model by solving the coupled Poisson and Schroinger equations.

All compounds were parameterized {{within the framework of the}} OPLS-AA force field, using an established protocol to compute the absolute hydration free energy via a windowed free energy perturbation approach and thermodynamic integration. Three different approaches to deriving partial charge parameters were pursued: (1) using existing OPLS-AA atom types and charges with minor adjustments of partial charges on equivalent connecting atoms; (2) calculation of quantum <b>mechanical</b> <b>charges</b> via geometry optimization, followed by electrostatic potential (ESP) fitting, using Jaguar at the LMP 2 /cc-pVTZ(-F) level; and (3) via geometry optimization and CHelpG charges (Gaussian 03 at the HF/ 6 - 31 G* level), followed by two-stage RESP fitting. Protocol 3 generated the most accurate predictions with a root mean square (RMS) error of 1. 2 kcal mol(- 1) for the entire data set. It was found that the deficiency of the standard OPLS-AA parameters, protocol 1 (RMS error 2. 4 kcal mol(- 1) overall), was mostly due to compounds with more than three chlorine substituents on an aromatic ring. For this latter subset, the RMS errors were 1. 4 kcal mol(- 1) (protocol 3) and 4. 3 kcal mol(- 1) (protocol 1), respectively.

Their over expression is associated with many disease states and hence the interest in MMPs as drug targets. Almost all MMP inhibitors {{have been reported to}} fail in clinical trials due to lack of specificity. Zinc in the binding site of metalloproteinases performs essential biological functions and contributes to the binding affinity of inhibitors. The multiple possibilities for coordination geometry and the consequent charge on the zinc atom indicate that parameters developed are not directly transferable across different families of zinc metalloproteinases with different zinc coordination geometries, active sites and ligand architectures which makes it difficult to evaluate metal–ligand interactions. In order to assist in drug design endeavors for MMP targets, a computationally tractable pathway is presented, comprising docking of small molecule inhibitors against the target MMPs, derivation of quantum <b>mechanical</b> <b>charges</b> on the zinc ion in the active site and the amino acids coordinating with zinc including the inhibitor molecule, molecular dynamics simulations on the docked ligand–MMP complexes and evaluation of binding affinities of the ligand–MMP complexes via an accurate scoring function for zinc containing metalloprotein–ligand complexes.

By construction, the proposed optimal point charge approximation (OPCA) retains many of the useful properties of point multipole expansion, including the same far-field asymptotic behavior of the approximate potential. A general framework for numerically computing OPCA, for any given number of approximating charges, is described. We then derive a 2 -charge practical point charge approximation, PPCA, which approximates the 2 -charge OPCA via closed form analytical expressions, and test the PPCA on a set of charge distributions relevant to biomolecular modeling. We measure the accuracy of the new approximations as the RMS error in the electrostatic potential relative to that produced by the original charge distribution, at a distance 2 x the extent of the charge distribution [...] the mid-field. The error for the 2 -charge PPCA is found to be on average 23 % smaller than that of optimally placed point dipole approximation, and comparable to that of the point quadrupole approximation. The standard deviation in RMS error for the 2 -charge PPCA is 53 % lower than that of the optimal point dipole approximation, and comparable to that of the point quadrupole approximation.
