5|$|Ballistic {{annihilation}} {{describes a}} {{process by which}} moving particles and antiparticles annihilate each other when they collide. In the simplest version of this process, the system consists of a single type of particle and antiparticle, <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> equal speeds in opposite directions in a one-dimensional medium.|$|E
5|$|Cluster {{diffusion}} involves {{motion of}} atomic clusters {{ranging in size}} from dimers to islands containing hundreds of atoms. Motion of the cluster may occur via the displacement of individual atoms, sections of the cluster, or the entire cluster <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> once. All of these processes involve a change in the cluster’s center of mass.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{observations}} {{were taken by}} the team on October 21, 2003, using the 1.2m Samuel Oschin Schmidt telescope at Palomar Observatory, California, but the image of Eris was not discovered at that point due to its very slow motion across the sky: The team's automatic image-searching software excluded all objects <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> less than 1.5arcseconds per hour {{to reduce the number}} of false positives returned. When Sedna was discovered, it was <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> 1.75arcsec/h, and in light of that the team reanalyzed their old data with a lower limit on the angular motion, sorting through the previously excluded images by eye. In January 2005, the re-analysis revealed Eris's slow motion against the background stars.|$|E

5|$|A few {{deductions}} {{can also}} be made from the satellite communications. The first deduction {{that can be made}} from the satellite communications is that the aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19—seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control over the South China Sea. The varying BFO values indicate the aircraft was <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> speed. The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards the satellite, so it {{can also be}} deduced that the aircraft's navigation system was operational.|$|E

5|$|At 01:00 on 25 April the British ships {{stopped at}} sea, and thirty-six rowing boats towed by twelve steamers {{embarked}} {{the first six}} companies, two each from the 9th, 10th and 11th Battalions.

At 02:53 the ships headed towards the peninsula, continuing until 03:30 when the larger ships stopped. With 50 yards (46m) to go, the rowing boats continued using only their oars.|$|E

When the van breaks down early on, the family learns that they must push the van until it is <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> about 20mph before it is put into gear, at which point they have to run up to the side door and jump in. Later on, the van's horn starts honking unceasingly by itself.|$|E
5|$|For {{a sample}} {{motorcycle}} <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> 22m/s (50mph) {{that has a}} front wheel with a moment of inertia of 0.6kg·m2, turning the front wheel one degree in half a second generates a roll moment of 3.5N·m. In comparison, the lateral force on the front tire as it tracks {{out from under the}} motorcycle reaches a maximum of 50N. This, acting on the 0.6m (2ft) height of the center of mass, generates a roll moment of 30N·m.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{put forward}} the basic {{principle}} of relativity, {{that the laws}} of physics are the same in any system that is <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> a constant speed in a straight line, regardless of its particular speed or direction. Hence, there is no absolute motion or absolute rest. This principle provided the basic framework for Newton's laws of motion and is central to Einstein's special theory of relativity.|$|E

5|$|Haynes asked Fitch {{to observe}} the ailerons through the {{passenger}} cabin windows to see if control inputs were having any effect. Fitch reported back that the ailerons were not <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> all. Nonetheless, the crew continued to manipulate their control columns {{for the remainder of}} the flight, hoping for at least some effect. Haynes then asked Fitch to take over control of the throttles so that Haynes could concentrate on his control column. With one throttle in each hand, Fitch was able to mitigate the phugoid cycle and make rough steering adjustments.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, the French Academy of Sciences made {{understanding}} bicycle dynamics {{the goal}} of its Prix Fourneyron competition. Thus, {{by the end of}} the 19th century, , Emmanuel Carvallo, and Francis Whipple had showed with rigid-body dynamics that some safety bicycles could actually balance themselves if <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> the right speed. Bourlet won the Prix Fourneyron, and Whipple won the Cambridge University Smith Prize. It is not clear to whom should go the credit for tilting the steering axis from the vertical which helps make this possible.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Vesto Slipher made spectrographic {{studies of}} the {{brightest}} spiral nebulae to determine their composition.

5|$|In the 1950s, the {{development}} of improved particle accelerators and particle detectors allowed scientists to study the impacts of atoms <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> high energies. Neutrons and protons {{were found to be}} hadrons, or composites of smaller particles called quarks. The standard model of particle physics was developed that so far has successfully explained the properties of the nucleus in terms of these sub-atomic particles and the forces that govern their interactions.|$|E
5|$|Infrared {{emission}} {{also reveals}} {{the presence of}} un-ionised material such as molecular hydrogen (H2) and argon. In many planetary nebulae, molecular emission is greatest at larger distances from the star, where more material is un-ionised, but molecular hydrogen emission in NGC 6543 seems to be bright at the inner edge of its outer halo. This {{may be due to}} shock waves exciting the H2 as ejecta <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> different speeds collide. The overall appearance of the Cat's Eye Nebula in infrared (wavelengths 2–8μm) is similar in visible light.|$|E
5|$|On June 27, 1997, the NEAR Shoemaker {{spacecraft}} passed within 1,212km of Mathilde while <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> a {{velocity of}} 9.93km/s. This close approach allowed the spacecraft to capture over 500 {{images of the}} surface, and provided data for more accurate determinations of the asteroid's dimensions and mass (based on gravitational perturbation of the spacecraft). However, only one hemisphere of Mathilde was imaged during the fly-by. This was only the third asteroid to be imaged from a nearby distance, following 951 Gaspra and 243 Ida.|$|E

5|$|September 12, 1960– Hurricane Donna, {{the only}} {{tropical}} cyclone to bring hurricane-force winds to every {{state on the}} East Coast of the United States, passes New Jersey as a Category2 hurricane while <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> a high speed. Damage is significant along the coastline, but is less than in other states struck directly by Donna. The hurricane causes winds gusts of up to 105mph (169km/h), heavy rainfall, and a storm surge of 6feet (2m). Well–executed warnings result in no direct deaths, though one indirect death occurs from a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|Since then, many {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} measuring such dragging coefficients, often {{in combination with the}} Sagnac effect. For instance, in experiments using ring lasers together with rotating disks, or in neutron interferometric experiments. Also a transverse dragging effect was observed, i.e. when the medium is <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> right angles to the direction of the incident light.|$|E
5|$|So-called superluminal {{motion is}} seen in certain astronomical objects, such as the {{relativistic}} jets of radio galaxies and quasars. However, these jets are not <b>moving</b> <b>at</b> speeds {{in excess of the}} speed of light: the apparent superluminal motion is a projection effect caused by objects moving near the speed of light and approaching Earth at a small angle to the line of sight: since the light which was emitted when the jet was farther away took longer to reach the Earth, the time between two successive observations corresponds to a longer time between the instants at which the light rays were emitted.|$|E
