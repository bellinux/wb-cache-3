5|$|According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Penda became king in 626, ruled for 30 years, and was 50 {{years old}} at the time of his accession. That he ruled for 30 years should not be taken as an exact figure, since the same source says he died in 655, which would not {{correspond}} to the year given for the beginning of his reign unless he died in the thirtieth year of his reign. Furthermore, that Penda was truly 50 {{years old at}} the beginning of his reign is generally doubted by historians, mainly because of the ages of his children. The idea that Penda, at about 80 years of age, would have left behind children who were still young (his son Wulfhere was still just a youth three years after Penda's death, according to Bede) has been widely considered implausible. The possibility has been suggested that the Chronicle actually <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Penda was 50 {{years old at the}} time of his death, and therefore about 20 in 626.|$|E

In an interview with BBC Radio, Eminem clarified that although contained a [...] "harsh" [...] line, he meant well: [...] "There's a line on there that was a little harsh. It's a harsh line. But it's like this, the way I look at it, I had no idea he was gonna take it like he took it. I had no idea Nick Cannon was gonna start wildin' out on me. No pun intended." [...] He later commented that he respected Cannon for his comment, and that he expected him to stand up for his wife: [...] "I didn't read his blog or anything. But it is what it is. He's supposed to defend his wife, and I expected him to do that. But {{at the end of the}} day, it's a line I said – it's a song.

500|$|... "Irresistible" [...] is a groove-laden song, {{following}} a musical setting that is beat-oriented. In {{an interview with}} Associated Press, Simpson said that [...] "Irresistible" [...] is [...] "very sexy, more grown-up. I think you're {{going to see a}} new side of Jessica Simpson." [...] Lyrically, according to Birgisson, the song carries some feminine viewpoints that Sheyne had managed to incorporate through her contribution. Ben Graham, the author of Maximum Jessica Simpson, noted that the lyrics suggest that Simpson finds it hard to keep her famous virginity image intact. This can be inferred from the lines [...] "I know that I'm supposed to make him wait / Let him think I like the chase / But I can't stop fanning the fire / I know I <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> no." [...] Bob Waliszewski of Plugged In pointed out that the verses [...] "I can't stop fanning the fire [...] Now inescapable" [...] refer to an [...] "imminent sexual compromise". [...] "She knows she shouldn't give in, but seems past the point of no return," [...] he explained. However, Taylor stated that lyrically, the song demands for [...] "total fulfillment". The version featured on Lizzie McGuire soundtrack replaces the lyric [...] "When he makes me weak with desire" [...] with [...] "When he makes me want to move closer" [...] and [...] "But I can't stop fanning the fire / I know I <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> no" [...] with [...] "But it's time to stop this emotion / Right now I'm gonna say no." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Peterotica" [...] {{was written}} by Patrick Meighan and {{directed}} by Kurt Dumas. The episode ran into multiple objections from broadcasting standards and the show's producers. For instance, the original title of the episode was [...] "A Connecticut Yankee and King Arthur's Butt", but broadcasting standards objected. A sequence showing all of the different erotic novels written by Peter was edited for the television version; one entitled Catcher in the Eye {{was removed from the}} television version as broadcasting standards disliked the cover, which implied her eye was a target for semen during ejaculation. The scene of Peter reading his new erotic novel to Lois was never cut from airing, although the producers of Family Guy had some trouble with it, as it is the second semen joke of the episode. When Lois' father, Carter, sits down at the breakfast table, Lois states: [...] "Daddy, did you remember to clean up?" [...] Originally, she was <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "Daddy, did you remember to wipe yourself?", but broadcasting standards objected, so it was modified to [...] "Daddy, did you remember to clean yourself?" [...] However, standards still objected, so it was changed to its current version.|$|E
500|$|Mateiu Caragiale's {{personal}} life has for long attracted {{interest for the}} traces it left in his literary work. This is enhanced by his reputation for being a secretive man. In a late interview, Cella Delavrancea described him as [...] "made up of [...] small patches, so well sewn together that one never knew what he had said, what he had <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> what he is thinking." [...] While Ionel Gherea suspected that Caragiale was merely acting, Eugen Lovinescu, who described Caragiale's personality as [...] "bizarre", also referred to him as [...] "colorful and sterile." [...] Despite his hectic lifestyle, Caragiale feared poverty and lashed out at Bohemianism, stressing that [...] "it kills, and many times not just figuratively". In tandem, fragments of his writings and private records are thought by cultural historian Andrei Oișteanu to show intimate familiarity with substance abuse and the drug subculture of his age, {{in addition to his}} self admitted binge drinking. During his final years of life, he was harvesting an unspecified wild herb from the hills of Cotroceni neighborhood, and using it as a sedative. By then, essayist Ion Vartic notes, Caragiale's obsession with death had developed into [...] "neurosis".|$|E

[...] Chuck Campbell of Daily News viewed the song as [...] "gurgling" [...] and noted that Simpson was singing it breathlessly. An editor of The Advocate remarked that the track sounded more manufactured than composed. Craig Seymour of The Buffalo News wrote that he felt [...] "Irresistible" [...] was a [...] "limp seduction tune". Similarly, David Browne of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the single could have been easily reprocessed for a [...] "new virginity ad campaign." [...] The Northern Echos Hayley Gyllenspetz dismissed the song, elaborating that it sounded similar to the works of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. She added, [...] "If only this 21-year-old songbird had done something original she may indeed have been irresistible." [...] An editor of The Malay Mail echoed Gyllenspetz's comment, writing that the track sounded like a typical Aguilera pop-Latino piece.

500|$|The [...] "Pony" [...] Johnson {{murder trial}} {{is based on}} a real-life trial {{featured}} in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction book about a Baltimore Police Department, which was adapted into the Homicide series. In that real-life trial, a Baltimore detective misspeaks during his testimony and nearly jeopardizes the outcome of the case. This is mirrored by the actions of Kay Howard, who accidentally says the victim was dead at least 24 hours when she <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> 12 hours, leaving an opening for defense attorney Darin Russom to question her recollection and expertise. The defense attorney in the real-life trial lost the case for himself with a procedural misstep similar to the one portrayed in [...] "And the Rockets Dead Glare". In the episode, Russom asks Howard whether she had ever seen a murder victim killed by both a knife and a gun. This allows Howard to mention a second victim police suspect [...] "Pony" [...] Johnson murdered, which she would not have been allowed to mention had Russom not asked her. Homicide filmmakers sought to portray the trial scenes in a far more realistic light than most police drama shows, particularly with the inclusion of less dramatic courtroom elements such as Howard's waiting anxiously to testify and the awkward pauses during her testimony.|$|E

2500|$|Healey was Shadow Foreign Secretary {{during most}} of the 1980s, a job he coveted.

2500|$|Ælfgifu's fame at Shaftesbury {{seems to}} have eclipsed that of its first abbess, King Alfred's {{daughter}} Æthelgifu, so much so perhaps that William of Malmesbury wrote contradictory reports on the abbey's early history. In the Gesta regum, he correctly identifies the first abbess as Alfred's daughter, following Asser, although he gives her the name of Ælfgifu (Elfgiva), while in his Gesta pontificum, he credits Edmund's wife Ælfgifu with the foundation. Either William encountered conflicting information, or he <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Ælfgifu refounded the nunnery.

She then went on to compare questioning of Obama's birth certificate to questions that were raised during the 2008 presidential elections about her maternity to her son, Trig. This analogy was criticized by Mark Milian of the Los Angeles Times, who commented that [...] "It's not like Barack Obama hosted a radio show and called her a baby faker." [...] In addition, Andrew Sullivan, an established skeptic of Palin's relationship with Trig, wrote in response to her comments: [...] "Palin has never produced Trig's birth certificate or a single piece of objective medical evidence that proves he is indeed her biological son." ...|$|E

Bohlen's response: [...] "I <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the music of Modern Talking will live forever". Anders has kept the Modern Talking songs in his repertoire and produced songs {{in a similar vein}} for his solo records ("Independent Girl"). In 2006, he produced an album Songs Forever of swing and jazz versions of popular songs (including Modern Talking's first hit). Bohlen has written two autobiographical books about Modern Talking's history from his perspective. The first book sold a million copies in Germany. The sequel was heavily criticised for his unfairness towards the people he worked with. As a result of that, Bohlen withdrew from the public for a year until 2006, when he said he regretted putting out the second book. Anders had not been the only one pressing charges against Bohlen and demanding that sections of the book be modified. Frank Farian was also angered by Bohlen's literary output and released a book in which he tried to expose Bohlen as a fraud.

2500|$|The Gemara {{interpreted}} the words [...] "knowing {{the mind of}} the most High" [...] in [...] to mean that Balaam knew how to tell the exact moment when God was angry. [...] The Gemara taught that this was related to what Micah meant (in [...] in the haftarah for the parashah) when he told the Israelites (quoting God): [...] "O My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; [...] [...] [...] that you may know the righteous acts of the Lord." [...] The Gemara taught that by the words [...] "that you may know the righteous acts of the Lord," [...] God <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to the Israelites, [...] "You should know how many acts of charity I performed for you, in that I did not become angry all that time, in the days of wicked Balaam; for had I become angry at that time, no Israelite would have remained alive or been spared." [...] And the Gemara indicated that this is why Balaam told Balak in [...] "How can I curse whom God has not cursed? or how shall I become angry, when the Lord has not become angry?" [...] For Balaam knew that God was not angry at the Israelites. [...] The Gemara thus concluded that for all of the time of the Balaam story, God had not been angry.|$|E

By the way, the ape is 45, which is half the age of Anthony Kiedis. Red Hot Chili Peppers, poor man's Faith No More, don't ever forget it." [...] After receiving major backlash from fans, Gutfeld decided to take further shots by saying [...] "Two days ago I said that Red Hot Chili Peppers were the worst band on the planet.

[...] Flea responded to Gutfeld's comments a few days later saying [...] "I remember seeing a poll recently that said people who watch Fox News knew less about world affairs than people who watch no news at all.
