50|$|Loom is a {{frame-based}} {{language in}} the tradition of KL-ONE. As with KL-ONE, Loom has a formal semantics that maps declarations in Loom to statements in set theory and First Order Logic. This formal semantics enables a type of theorem prover engine called a classifier. The classifier can analyze Loom models (known as ontologies) and deduce various things about the model. For example, the classifier can discover new classes or change the subclass/superclass relations in the model. The classifier can also detect inconsistencies in the <b>model</b> <b>declaration.</b> This is a very powerful and fairly unusual capability in that it is capable of doing analysis at the ontology level, the level of declarations rather than at the implementation level as most inference engines do.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} G, a new language specifically created for generic programming. We review and identify important language features of C ++ and Haskell {{in light of the}} past decade of generic library research and development. Based on this analysis we propose and evaluate relevant language design decisions for G. Generic programming is concerned with the construction of libraries of reusable software components and is inherently about programming “in the large. ” Thus, the design of G places its greatest emphasis on modularity and safety, while also providing runtime efficiency and programmer convenience. This paper focuses on name scoping and type checking for generic functions, support for dispatching to algorithm specializations, support for type associations among abstractions, and separate compilation. The resulting design for G includes three novel aspects: scoped <b>models</b> <b>declarations,</b> nested types in concepts, and optional type constraints on generic functions...|$|R

EMF Objects can be queried and retrieved by means of the language LINQ, these queries are in turn translated into the native query language of the database engine of choice e. g., LINQ to XQuery translation. For querying and managing EMF Objects in DBMS, one possibility is to use a language that can be processed on the database without a need of further translation. Such a query language is XQuery, which can be processed by the XML database management system eXist db.

40|$|The biphasic {{effect of}} soy isoflavones (genistein and daidzein) on {{oestrogen}} receptor (ER) α+ breast cancer cell proliferation is well documented, with concentrations of ≤ 10 µM promoting proliferation, and growth inhibitory and apoptotic effects seen at concentrations ≥ 10 µM. However genistein concentrations {{as low as}} 1 nM may inhibit the proliferation of some ERα-/β+ cells. This {{is at odds with}} epidemiological evidence which suggests that high serum levels of soy isoflavones (around 1 µM) are associated with reduced breast cancer risk, particularly for ERα+ and premenopausal cancers. It is possible that interactions with endogenous oestrogens may be behind this discrepancy. The object here was to investigate combinations of genistein and daidzein at levels achievable in the serum through diet alone, at pre- and postmenopausal oestrogen levels, on breast cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis. ERα+ MCF 7 and ERα-/β+ MDA-MB- 231 cells were treated with genistein, daidzein and 17 β-oestradiol at physiologically relevant levels. Physiological levels of soy isoflavones promoted but not inhibit the proliferation of MCF 7 cells, whilst simultaneously inducing low level apoptosis. E 2 acted synergistically on proliferation with the isoflavones, increasing proliferation further, but did not impact upon their apoptotic capacity. All concentrations of genistein and daidzein resulted in a slight reduction in MDA-MB- 231 proliferation, with this dropping dramatically at the highest dose of 31. 6 µM. Overall this suggests that physiological levels of isoflavones may be of benefit as chemotherapeutic agents against ERα-/β+ breast cancer. However they are not capable of reducing the proliferation of ERα+ MCF 7 cells, or inhibiting oestrogenic promotion of growth. Other factors must be involved, not reflected by this <b>model.</b> <b>Declaration</b> of interest: There is no conflict of interest that could be perceived as prejudicing the impartiality of the research reported.

Their proposals, termed the Heads of Proposals, included provisions for social justice, but the monarchy and House of Lords would have retained a power of veto over the House of Commons. A further feature of the Heads of Proposals was that the king would be restored before the issues of the soldiers' indemnity and arrears were entrenched in law.

40|$|Model {{management}} research {{seeks to}} improve decision making by creating tools that facilitate {{the use of}} models, data, and other knowledge. Earlier modeling systems incorporated procedures for model solution, but did little to support many other phases in the modeling life cycle. General agreement obtains that these other phases must be supported {{for the use of}} mathematical models to become more widespread and effective. Many recent approaches to model management use an executable modeling language (EML) to represent mathematical models declaratively, and to manipulate this representation to perform functions such as model translation. ^ This thesis extends the EML approach, arguing that existing modeling systems lack adequate means for representing, and usefully extracting, much information about models and modeling elements other than that required to just solve models. It aims to provide a formal, general means to represent and usefully extract such information, by developing the embedded languages technique and applying it to model management. ^ In the embedded languages technique (as applied to model management) an EML, which partially formalizes the target language that we use to represent, describe, and reason about models, is embedded within a formal embedding language for model management. The technique creates dual interpretation for the symbols and expressions in the embedded language, through rules of formation such that terms and formulas in the embedded language can be treated as terms in the embedding language. This strategy enables the embedded language to (1) represent rigorously, flexibly and with generality, a rich variety of qualitative knowledge about models that could normally not be stated in the modeling language itself, (2) use this knowledge in defining inferences that are useful in the modeling process, (3) represent rules of formation for expressions in the modeling language, and use them to examine validity of <b>model</b> <b>declarations,</b> and (4) embed and integrate multiple languages. This technique was applied to develop a prototype modeling system, now in use at the U. S. Coast Guard, for the rapid development, documentation, and use of a wide class of models. ...|$|R

40|$|The Swedish {{economic}} policy to combine full employment and equity with price stability {{and economic growth}} was developed by two trade union economists shortly after World War II. Through the use of extensive employment policy measures, a tight fiscal policy and a wage policy of solidarity, the Rehn-Meidner model represents a unique third way between Keynesianism and monetarism. This essay analyses the application and performance of the Rehn-Meidner model in Sweden. Although never consistently applied, {{it is possible to}} distinguish a golden age for the model from the late 1950 s to the early 1970 s. In the 1970 s and the 1980 s, governments abandoned the restrictive macroeconomic means of the model and were thus unable to combine low rates of unemployment with low inflation and high economic growth.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we look at}} {{the application}} of two dimensional conservation laws with source terms to two specific physical examples, the shallow water equations and crowd flow. There are a number of techniques {{that can be used to}} numerically approximate such systems. We discuss the Q scheme method of Bermúdez & Vázquez, focusing on an extension to Roe’s Q scheme. The technique of dimensional splitting is used to decompose the systems into two one-dimensional problems that are solved alternately in the x and y directions. For the shallow water equations we examine two different test problems. We begin by considering a non-rotating frame of reference, before extending the equations to include the effects of the Earth’s rotation. The β-plane approximation is used to avoid the complications of spherical geometry whilst retaining the leading order effect of the Earth’s curvature. We then move on to develop a two dimensional macroscopic model of crowd flow based on a one-dimensional continuum model proposed by Payne and Whitham. The equations are transformed into a system of conservation laws, with source term in the form of a relaxation term. A series of numerical experiments are used to evaluate the accuracy of the <b>model.</b> i <b>Declaration</b> I confirm that this is my own work and the use of all materials from other sources has been properly and fully acknowledged...|$|R

It assumes that the reader is familiar with Fortran 90, especially with its array features and other new facilities, such as procedure interfaces, on which the auto-parallelisation is based. If not, an overview of these features can be found in [2, 3]. These references also provide an overview of the execution model for the transformed output program, while this report describes the execution model in more detail. The layout of the report is as follows. Section 2 describes the data distribution <b>model</b> and <b>declarations</b> of Distributed Fortran 90, and the restrictions it imposes on the use of distributed data and of some old Fortran features. Sections 3 and 4 describe in detail the auto-parallelisation techniques employed by ADAPT, and comprise the main body of the report. Section 3 introduces the basic principles and techniques, such as array partitioning, subscript transformation, attribute vectors, regular section parameterisation, and dynamic storage allocation. Section 4 describes the transformation of array expressions and assignments, which is the core of the auto-parallelisation process. Section 5 suggests two further language extensions to Distributed Fortran 90 (or perhaps Fortran generally) that would assist distributed memory auto-parallelisation while not impairing language portability.
