Several years later at the National Cancer Institute, Roy Hertz and Min Chiu Li then demonstrated complete remission in women with choriocarcinoma and chorioadenoma in 1956, discovering that methotrexate alone could cure choriocarcinoma (1958), a germ-cell malignancy that originates in trophoblastic cells of the placenta.

2500|$|The {{cancer is}} {{classified}} into {{low and high}} grade types. [...] Classification is also based on location. [...] The four location types are multicentric, mediastinal, gastrointestinal, and extranodal (involving the kidney, central nervous system, skin, heart, or eye). [...] Multicentric lymphoma, {{the most common type}} (by greater than 80 percent), is found in the lymph nodes, with or without involvement in the liver, spleen, or bone marrow. [...] Mediastinal lymphoma occurs in the lymph nodes in the thorax and possibly the thymus. [...] Gastrointestinal lymphoma occurs as either a solitary tumor or diffuse invasion of the stomach or intestines, with or without involvement in the surrounding lymph nodes, liver or spleen. [...] Classification is further based on involvement of B-lymphocytes or T-lymphocytes. [...] Approximately 70 percent are B-cell lymphoma. [...] Cutaneous lymphoma can be classified as epitheliotropic (closely conforming to the epidermis) or non-epitheliotropic. [...] The epitheliotropic form is typically of T-cell origin and is also called <b>mycosis</b> <b>fungoides.</b> [...] The non-epitheliotropic form is typically of B-cell origin.|$|E
