50|$|A {{primary focus}} of the {{research}} in the Bryant laboratory is of information obtainable from the <b>magnetic</b> <b>relaxation</b> dispersions (MRD) or from the magnetic field dependence of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate {{as a function of}} the magnetic field strength. The unique instrumentation, constructed in the Bryant Lab, permits acquisition of MRD profiles for a variety of nuclear resonances in high resolution. The collected MRD profiles report relative inter and intramolecular motions over the time range from about ten microseconds to one picosecond. The measurements are sensitive to relatively weak intermolecular interactions and permit definition of highly localized intermolecular free energy differences in solutions. Multinuclear studies of proteins in a number of dynamical environments provide a fundamental characterization of how the protein structure fluctuates in time and how energy is redistributed in the folded structure. The practical implications range from understanding protein catalytic function to developing new techniques for diagnostic medicine in the context of magnetic resonance imaging or MRI.|$|E

50|$|Korringa’s work {{is outside}} the usual {{measures}} {{for the evaluation of}} scientific success in that his theories are referred to much more often than they are referenced. For example, the acronyms KKR and MST are used all the time without referencing the original 1947 paper. Another example is the Korringa relation, quoted without attribution in many papers on nuclear magnetic resonance and many-body theory. In 1950, Korringa showed that the spin relaxation rate divided by the square of the magnetic resonance field shift (the Knight shift) obtained from an NMR experiment is equal to a constant, κ, times the temperature T. The magnitude of the Korringa constant κ and its possible deviation from a constant value is the signature of the effects of strong correlations in the electron gas. Those considerations have proved valuable in recent studies of strongly correlated electron materials and high-temperature superconductors.

50|$|The {{wettability}} {{conditions in}} a porous media containing {{two or more}} immiscible fluid phases determine the microscopic fluid distribution in the pore network. Nuclear magnetic resonance measurements are sensitive to wettability because of the strong effect that the solid surface has on promoting <b>magnetic</b> <b>relaxation</b> of the saturating fluid. The idea of using NMR {{as a tool to}} measure wettability was presented by Brown and Fatt in 1956. The magnitude of this effect depends upon the wettability characteristics of the solid with respect to the liquid in contact with the surface. Their theory is based on the hypothesis that molecular movements are slower in the bulk liquid than at the solid-liquid interface. In this solid-liquid interface the diffusion coefficient is reduced, which correspond to a zone of higher viscosity. In this higher viscosity zone, the magnetically aligned protons can more easily transfer their energy to their surroundings. The magnitude of this effect depends upon the wettability characteristics of the solid with respect to the liquid in contact with the surface.|$|E
5000|$|NMR {{techniques}} are typically {{used to predict}} permeability for ﬂuid typing and to obtain formation porosity, which is independent of mineralogy. The former application uses a surface-relaxation mechanism to relatemeasured relaxation spectra with surface-to-volume ratios of pores, and the latter is used to estimate permeability. The common approach {{is based on the}} model proposed by Brownstein and Tarr. They have shown that, in the fast diffusion limit, given by the expression:where [...] is the surface relaxivity of pore wall material, [...] is the radius of the spherical pore and [...] is the bulk diffusivity. The connection between NMR relaxation measurements and petrophysical parameters such as permeability stems from the strong effect that the rock surface has on promoting <b>magnetic</b> <b>relaxation.</b> For a single pore, the magnetic decay as a function of time is described by a single exponential:where [...] is the initial magnetization and the transverse relaxation time [...] is given by: is the surface-to-volume ratio of the pore, [...] is bulk relaxation time of the fluid that fills the pore space, and [...] is the surface relaxation strength. For small pores or large , the bulk relaxation time is small and the equation can be approximated by: Real rocks contain an assembly of interconnected pores of different sizes. The pores are connected through small and narrow pore throats (i.e. links) that restrict interpore diffusion. If interpore diffusion is negligible, each pore can be considered to be distinct and the magnetization within individual pores decays independently of the magnetization in neighbouring pores. The decay can thus be described as: ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} results of research {{into some of the}} subtle and not-so-subtle factors that govern slow <b>magnetic</b> <b>relaxation</b> in lanthanide and actinide complexes. Single-molecule magnetism is only now entering its third decade, while the lanthanides and actinides in particular have only {{been a part of the}} field for about the last decade and half a decade, respectively. Within this time, the study of slow <b>magnetic</b> <b>relaxation</b> in f-element systems has proven to be a rich and complex area of research. Chapter 1 sets out to provide some historical context for the state of the f-elements in the field today as well as to highlight some of the most impressive systems in the literature. Some of the themes introduced in Chapter 1 will be relevant to the research discussed in subsequent chapters. Chapter 2 describes the detailed magnetic characterization of U(H 2 BPz 2) 3, only the second actinide molecule found to exhibit slow <b>magnetic</b> <b>relaxation,</b> in magnetically dilute form. The results of variable-temperature and variable-field ac susceptibility measurements reveal that dipolar interactions are implicit in speeding up molecular slow relaxation and also facilitate very slow intermolecular relaxation that leads to magnetic hysteresis at low temperatures. When placed in the context of some relevant literature, {{the results of}} this study suggest that the intermolecular relaxation and observed hysteresis may be unrecognized, though common, phenomena among low-nuclearity U(III) molecules exhibiting slow <b>magnetic</b> <b>relaxation.</b> Chapter 3 describes a detailed study of the role of donor atom influence and dipolar interactions on slow <b>magnetic</b> <b>relaxation</b> in two series of uranium and lanthanide compounds with nitrogen and carbon donor atoms, respectively. Through a combination of magnetic susceptibility characterization and lanthanide M 5, 4 -edge XANES, EPR, and 1 H NMR spectroscopies, it is found that the carbon donor facilitates slower <b>magnetic</b> <b>relaxation</b> for all metal ions in the investigated temperature and frequency range. Thus, in addition to symmetry, the identity of the donor atom is revealed to be another tunable parameter in the design of f-element complexes exhibiting slow <b>magnetic</b> <b>relaxation.</b> Chapter 4 describes full magnetic characterization of concentrated and magnetically dilute samples of the bis(cyclooctatetraenide) complex [Er(COT) 2]−. The high symmetry ligand field afforded by the two (COT) 2 − groups leads to exceptionally slow <b>magnetic</b> <b>relaxation</b> for Er(III), with magnetic blocking at 9. 25 K and magnetic hysteresis as high as 10 K. Magnetic dilution also leads to an unprecedented opening of the hysteresis loop for this molecule at low temperatures, demonstrating that dipolar or intermolecular interactions can affect slow <b>magnetic</b> <b>relaxation</b> in some anomalous ways, by analogy with Chapter 2. Finally, Chapter 5 changes gears slightly and investigates slow <b>magnetic</b> <b>relaxation</b> in the series of (N 2) 3 − radical-bridged complexes {[(Me 3 Si) 2 N) 2 Ln(THF) ] 2 (μ-N 2) K} (for Ln = Gd(III), Tb(III), Dy(III)). Inner-sphere coordination of the K+ counter-ion in these complexes leads to bending of the Ln-radical-Ln unit, which is planar in the previously reported parent complexes {[(Me 3 Si) 2 N) 2 Ln(THF) ] 2 (μ-N 2) }− exhibiting an outer-sphere potassium ion. While the parent complexes hold records for both blocking temperature and magnetic coupling strength, bending of the core in {[(Me 3 Si) 2 N) 2 Ln(THF) ] 2 (μ-N 2) K} introduces non-negligible intramolecular lanthanide-lanthanide coupling that competes with the lanthanide-radical interaction. This competition results in depressed magnetic moments and faster <b>magnetic</b> <b>relaxation</b> for the anisotropic lanthanides, revealing that even a seemingly simple counter-ion can be used to tune slow <b>magnetic</b> <b>relaxation...</b>|$|E
