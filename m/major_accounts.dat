40|$|This study {{extends the}} {{literature}} that uses the theory of planned behaviour in examining the factors that impact on students' intentions to <b>major</b> in <b>accounting</b> and non-accounting disciplines. A survey of a sample of business students enrolled in an introductory accounting course in a New Zealand University was conducted to gather data about their intended academic majors, and their beliefs and attitudes towards <b>majoring</b> in <b>accounting</b> and non-accounting. The results show that three factors (personal, referents, and control) are determinants of students' intention to <b>major</b> in <b>accounting</b> or other business disciplines. Further analysis revealed that the students' major intentions are influenced by important referents' perceptions. In particular, parents {{appear to have a}} stronger influence on students' intentions to <b>major</b> in <b>accounting.</b> Comparisons of differential personal perceptions by <b>accounting</b> and non-accounting <b>majors</b> revealed that <b>accounting</b> <b>majors</b> hold positive perceptions of some of the qualities of the study of accounting and the accounting profession. Significant differences were also found in the control perception between <b>accounting</b> and non-accounting <b>major</b> students. <b>Accounting</b> <b>major,</b> <b>accounting</b> education, accounting career, accounting profession,...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} fees paid to {{auditors}} during a <b>major</b> <b>accounting</b> change associated with extra audit risk and work. Specifically, we analyse how a <b>major</b> <b>accounting</b> change from local GAAP to IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) affects the audit and non-audit fees paid to auditors. Prior research had evidenced that several auditee-specific properties {{are associated with}} audit fees. However, there is lack of specific knowledge on how a <b>major</b> <b>accounting</b> change affects audit and, especially, non-audit fees. Our sample comprises Finnish listed firms that adopted IFRS for the first-time. The Finnish data are employed since prior research findings {{suggest that there are}} large differences between Finnish accounting standards (FAS) and IFRS anticipating extra audit risk and work at the accounting move. Therefore, it is highly likely that extensive supply for audit and non-audit services during the transition from FAS to IFRS would occur. When taking into account several control variables, in line with prior research, our analyses based on unique, hand-collected data provide evidence that a company with a high FAS-IFRS disparity is associated with more costly non-audit services during the transition phase than one with low disparity. Furthermore, the results reveal that audit fees, where audit markets are more competitive, are not significantly related to the magnitude of IFRS adjustments. Overall, the research findings inform, among other things, audit firms and their clients about the type and the level of costs incurred during a <b>major</b> <b>accounting</b> change. ...|$|R

Using the theory of planned behaviour, the objectives are to compare intentions with behaviour in relation to <b>majoring</b> in <b>accounting</b> and other business disciplines and to examine changes in attitudes and beliefs between the beginning and end of university study. The results indicate many students choose majors that are consistent with their intentions at the beginning of their university study but some students also change their intentions and major in other areas. Some attitudes and beliefs change over time but the major choice tends to remain relatively stable. The results suggest that a higher proportion of accounting students than other business students decide on their major prior to university study. This may suggest that promoting accounting as a career may need to focus on pre-university students. <b>Accounting</b> <b>major,</b> <b>accounting</b> education, accounting career, theory of planned behaviour,...|$|R
