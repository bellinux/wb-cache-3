40|$|Patent Blue V (E 131) is {{intended}} to add colour to feedingstuffs. It is applied for use in non food-producing animals only. The assessment is therefore limited to its safety for the target animals and the users and its efficacy. As no tolerance data were available, the <b>safe</b> feed <b>concentration</b> for target animals was derived from a NOAEL (no observable adverse effect level) from a chronic toxicity study in mice. The <b>maximum</b> <b>safe</b> feed <b>concentration</b> of Patent Blue V is 250 mg/kg complete feed for non food-producing animals. Patent Blue V is not genotoxic. This conclusion is limited to Patent Blue V having a minimum purity of 90 % and containing not more than 1 % of leuco base. Patent Blue V is poorly absorbed and has low systemic toxicity. In the absence of data on irritancy, sensitisation and inhalation toxicity, it would be prudent to treat Patent Blue V as an irritant and a skin sensitiser and as toxic by inhalation. Although a demonstration of efficacy is not required for additives that are used for the same function in food, an assessment of efficacy with respect to different doses {{and the nature of}} the feedingstuffs and their processing was not possible. The safety assessment is based on a Patent Blue V with a specification different from that currently used for the food additive. It is strongly recommended that the specification should be adjusted to match that of the product used in the critical genotoxicity study (in vivo comet assay).

The FEEDAP Panel is not in the position to derive a <b>maximum</b> <b>safe</b> iron <b>concentration</b> in feed for horses or fish. Consumption surveys include iron-containing foodstuffs of animal origin. Since the supplementation of animal feed with iron-containing compounds has not essentially changed during the last decades, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the iron levels in food of animal origin used in exposure scenarios originated from animals fed iron-supplemented diets. Since iron chelate of amino acids, hydrate, will be used as a substitute for other iron compounds, its use in animal nutrition would not modify consumer exposure to iron. The additive should be considered as a skin, eye and respiratory irritant and, owing to its residual peptide component, as a skin/respiratory sensitiser. Considering the high background concentration of iron in soil and water, the supplementation of feed with iron chelate of amino acids, hydrate, is not expected to pose an environmental risk. Iron chelate of amino acids, hydrate, is an effective source of iron for all animal species and categories.

In order to reveal the Cd {{contamination in}} rice and paddy soils and the health risks to the population consuming the local rice grain, field surveys were conducted in eight towns in Youxian, China. The Cd contents of paddy soils averaged 0. 228 - 1. 91 mg kg(- 1), 90 % exceeding the allowable limit of 0. 3 mg kg(- 1) stipulated by the China Soil Environmental Quality Standards. Low average pH values (for air dried oxidized soils) ranging from 4. 98 to 6. 02 in paddy soil were also found. More than seventy percent (39 of 53) of the grain samples exceeded the <b>maximum</b> <b>safe</b> <b>concentration</b> of Cd, 0. 2 mg kg(- 1) on a dry weight basis. Considering the high consumption of local rice (339 g capita(- 1) DW d(- 1)) and Cd levels measured, dietary ingestion of 78 % of the sampled rice grains would have adverse health risks because the intake exposure of Cd was greater than the JECFA recommended exposures, 0. 8 mu g Cd BW kg 1 day(- 1) or 25 mu g Cd BW kg(- 1) month(- 1).

The elevated contents of Pb, Cd and As detected in soils around the factories, indicated that their spatial distribution was influenced by anthropogenic activity, while greater concentrations of Cd in rice appeared in the northwest region of the factories, indicating that the spatial distribution of heavy metals was also affected by natural factors. As human exposure around {{mining district}}s is mainly through oral intake of food and dermal contact, the effects of these metals on the viability and MT protein of HepG 2 and KERTr cells were investigated. The cell viability decreased with increasing metal concentrations. Co-exposure to heavy metals (Pb+Cd) increased the metals (Pb or Cd) -mediated MT protein induction in both human HepG 2 and KERTr cells. Increased levels of MT protein will lead to greater risk of carcinogenic manifestations, and it is likely that chronic exposure to metals may increase the risk to human health. Nevertheless, when co-exposure to two or more metals occur (such as As+Pb), they may have an antagonistic effect thus reducing the toxic effects of each other...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: p. [i-iii]. The {{service life}} of {{concrete}} in particularly extreme bacteriological environments {{has long been}} a problem that has been facing engineers and concrete materials experts. This is particularly relevant for the case of concrete sewer pipes, the useful life of which is critically limited by corrosion due primarily, and ultimately, to sulphide attack. Sulphides are formed from the sewage sulphates, by bacteria in the slime layers {{on the walls of the}} pipe. These diffuse, firstly into the liquid, and then into the sewer atmosphere as hydrogen sulphide, which is then in turn oxidised to sulphuric acid. Hydrogen sulphide gas is well known for its characteristic "rotten eggs" odour, but more important although less known, for its extreme toxicity. The <b>maximum</b> <b>safe</b> <b>concentration</b> in air is only twice that of hydrogen cyanide. It also has the dangerous side effect that the ability to sense it by smell is quickly lost after first encountering the gas, and deaths have occurred in sewers that can be both directly and indirectly attributed to hydrogen sulphide poisoning. The corrosion discussed in this thesis refers primarily to that caused by this bacteriologically created sulphuric acid attack in the space above the liquid, as opposed to sub-liquid level corrosion due to aggressive chemicals, more commonly associated with industrial effluents. This is all discussed more fully in later sections...|$|E

No safety concern would arise for the consumer from the use of compounds belonging to CG 6 up to the highest safe level in feedingstuffs for all animal species.

Because of insufficient data, the FEEDAP Panel {{is not in a}} position to derive a <b>maximum</b> <b>safe</b> iron <b>concentration</b> in feed for horses or fish; as a provisional measure, the current value (750 mg/kg) could be maintained. The values for total dietary iron for pigs, ovines, horses, fish and other species/categories (except poultry, bovines and pets) are in line with those currently authorised. Iron from ferrous sulphate heptahydrate is unlikely to modify the iron concentration in edible tissues and products of animal origin. Consumer exposure in the EU is not associated with a risk of excess iron intake to the general population. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel does not foresee any concern for consumer safety resulting from the use of ferrous sulphate heptahydrate in animal nutrition, provided that the maximum iron content in complete feedingstuffs is respected. Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate is an irritant and corrosive to the skin, eyes and respiratory tract; thus, handling of the additive poses a hazard to the user/worker. Considering the high background concentration of iron and sulphur in soil and water, the supplementation of feed with ferrous sulphate heptahydrate is not expected to pose an environmental risk.
