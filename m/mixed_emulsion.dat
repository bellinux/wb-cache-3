40|$|Medium-chain {{triglycerides}} {{are generally}} {{assumed to be}} metabolized independently of carnitine. The effects of infusing medium-chain triglycerides on plasma concentrations of carnitine derivatives and β-hydroxybutyrate were studied in four healthy male adults. Glucose and amino acids were infused alone for three hours, then continued for another 5. 5 hours together with a lipid emulsion containing only long-chain triglycerides or a mixture of medium-chain and long-chain triglycerides (50 : 50; w/w). During the fat-free infusion, the concentration of free carnitine rose, while the level of acylcarnitines decreased. Infusion of the <b>mixed</b> <b>emulsion</b> over 5. 5 hours reduced free carnitine to lower values (32. 4 ± 4. 7 μmol/L) than long-chain triglycerides infusion (44. 4 ± 2. 7 μmol/L). By contrast, the plasma concentrations of short-chain acylcarnitines (12. 1 ± 3. 3 vs. 5. 4 ± 1. 9 μmol/L: p< 0. 01) and of (5 -hydroxybutyrate (93 ± 32 vs. 47 ± 14 μmol/L: p< 0. 01) became significantly higher with the <b>mixed</b> <b>emulsion</b> than with long-chain triglycerides. These findings suggest that oxidation of medium-chain fatty acids is to some extent carnitine-dependent, whether or not transport into mitochondria is carnitine-mediated. © 1991 S.

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{describes the}} formation, stability, and properties of colloidal dispersions formed by hetero-aggregation of oppositely charged lipid droplets. Micro-clusters were formed by <b>mixing</b> an oil-in-water <b>emulsion</b> containing β-lactoglobulin-coated lipid droplets (d 32 ∼ 0. 14 μm) with another oil-in-water emulsion containing lactoferrin-coated lipid droplets (d 32 ∼ 0. 14 μm). These two proteins have different electrical charge versus pH characteristics {{because of their}} different isoelectric points: β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg), pI ≈ 5; lactoferrin (LF) pI ≈ 8. The ζ-potential, mean particle diameter, microstructure, creaming stability, and perceived texture of the resulting <b>mixed</b> <b>emulsions</b> were measured. Aggregates of positively and negatively charged droplets could be formed at pH values where the two proteins had opposite charges, i. e., pIβ-Lg 3 ̆c pH 3 ̆c pILF. The characteristics of the aggregates formed depended on pH and the ratio of positive-to-negative droplets. Micro-cluster formation altered the creaming stability and textural properties of the <b>mixed</b> <b>emulsions.</b> Micro-clusters may be useful functional ingredients to modulate the physicochemical properties of food systems, such as release characteristics, mouth feel, stability, or texture...|$|R

40|$|Proteins and polysaccharides {{are widely}} used as food {{ingredients}} because {{of their ability to}} improve the shelf-life stability and texture of food products. Under conditions where positively charged residues are present on the protein molecules, negatively charged polysaccharides can interact with the protein to fonn electrostatic complexes. This study reports on the effect of the use of a highly sulfated polysaccharide, dextran sulfate or t-carrageenan, on model oil-in-water emulsions containing sodium caseinate, with respect to the stability of the emulsions towards two environmental stresses to which foods are exposed during digestion: acidification and trypsin hydrolysis. Two routes were investigated for preparation of the emulsions. Bilayer emulsions were prepared by a layer-by-Iayer deposition technique, in which the polysaccharide was added to a protein-stabilized <b>emulsion.</b> <b>Mixed</b> <b>emulsions</b> were prepared by a one-step method, in which soluble complexes were present during homogenization of the emulsions. In bilayer emulsions at pH = 6, bridging flocculation was observed at low polysaccharide concentration, and polymeric restabilization at high concentration. No flocculation was observed in the <b>mixed</b> <b>emulsions</b> at any polysaccharide concentration. The presence of 1 wt% dextran sulfate in the <b>mixed</b> or bilayer <b>emulsion</b> was found to protect the emulsion against acid-induced precipitation and enhance its shelf-life stability. The presence of ~ 0. 1 wt% polysaccharide in both types of emulsions was found to reduce significantly the extent of trypsinolysis, as detennined by chromatogniphy. A different set of peptide fragments was produced {{in the presence of the}} polysaccharide (hydrophilic ~-casein peptIde), as compared in the absence of polysaccharide (hydrophobic ~-casein peptide). Surface dilatational and shear rheology at the oil-water interface revealed that the bilayer system had weaker viscoelastic properties than the mixed system. The different physical and enzymatic properties of the bilayer and <b>mixed</b> <b>emulsions</b> can be explained in tenns ofthe interfacial structures ofthe systems.

40|$|Sample {{preparation}} for Roche/ 454, ABI/SOLiD and Life Technologies/Ion Torrent sequencing {{are based on}} amplification of library fragments {{on the surface of}} beads prior to sequencing. Commonly, libraries are barcoded and pooled, to maximise the sequence output of each sequence run. Here, we describe a novel approach for normalization of multiplex next generation sequencing libraries after emulsion PCR. Briefly, amplified libraries carrying unique barcodes are prepared by fluorescent tagging of complementary sequences and then resolved by high-speed flow cytometric sorting of labeled emulsion PCR beads. The protocol is simple and provides an even sequence distribution of multiplex libraries when sequencing the flow-sorted beads. Moreover, since many empty and <b>mixed</b> <b>emulsion</b> PCR beads are removed, the approach gives rise to a substantial increase in sequence quality and mean read length, as compared to that obtained by standard enrichment protocols...|$|E

Therefore, β-cell {{function}} and lipid metabolism were compared in these populations during a mixed meal. Research Methods and Procedures Blood concentrations of glucose, {{free fatty acids}} (FFAs), insulin, lipograms, and in vivo FFA oxidation were determined at fasting and for 7 hours after oral administration of a <b>mixed</b> <b>emulsion</b> containing glucose-casein-sucrose-lipid and [1 - 13 C] palmitic acid in 8 lean black women (LBW), 10 obese black women (OBW), 9 lean white women (LWW), and 10 obese white women (OWW). Subcutaneous and visceral fat mass was assessed by computerized tomography. Results Visceral fat area was higher in OWW (152. 7 ± 17. 0 cm 2) than OBW (80. 0 ± 6. 7 cm 2; p < 0. 01). In OBW, 30 -minute insulin levels were higher (604. 3 ± 117. 6 pM) than OWW (311. 0 ± 42. 9 pM; p < 0. 05). Total triglyceride was higher in OWW (706. 7 ± 96. 0 mM × 7 hours) than OBW (465. 7 ± 48. 2 mM × 7 hours; p < 0. 05) and correlated with visceral fat area (β = 0. 38, p = 0. 05). Palmitate oxidation was higher in lean than obese women in both ethnic groups and correlated negatively with fat mass (β = − 0. 58, p < 0. 005). Discussion The higher 30 -minute insulin response in OBW may reflect a higher insulinotropic effect of FFAs or glucose. The elevated triglyceride level of OWW {{may be due to}} their higher visceral fat mass and possibly reduced clearance by adipose tissue...|$|E
40|$|The phase {{separation}} {{of a model}} system consisting of sodium caseinate + xanthan ± a low fraction (up to 3 wt %) of an oil-in-water emulsion was studied at room temperature (20 - 25 C). The composition of the oil phase was either 100 wt % n-tetradecane (TD); 50 % TD + 50 % eicosane (EC) or 100 % EC. The droplets in these three "emulsions" were therefore totally liquid, partially solid, and totally solid, respectively. In the presence of 22 mM CaCl 2, the mixed TD+EC droplets were most effective at inhibiting {{phase separation}}, while the EC emulsions could not prevent phase separation at all. At 32 mM CaCl 2 the emulsions tended to promote phase separation, possibly due to enhanced calcium ion-induced droplet aggregation. The apparent interfacial viscosity (ηi) between two macroscopically separated phases was also measured. In {{the presence of the}} semisolid mixed droplets ηi = 25 mN s m- 1, significantly higher than ηi with the pure (liquid) TD droplets (15 mN s m- 1) or with the pure solid EC droplets (12 mN s m- 1) or in the absence of droplets (< 3 mN s m- 1). Confocal microscopy showed that the microstructure of the phase separating regions also depended upon the composition of the oil droplets, and it is tentatively suggested that the more marked effects of the <b>mixed</b> <b>emulsion</b> droplets were due to them forming a stronger network at the interface via partial coalescence. Control of the extent of interfacial aggregation of droplets is therefore possibly one way to influence the course of phase separation in biopolymer mixtures...|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} in obesity and overweight {{in many countries}} {{has led to an}} upsurge of interest in the development of reduced fat food products. However, the development of these products is challenging because of the many roles that fat droplets normally plays in these food products, including contributing to flavor, texture, appearance, and bioactivity. The goal of this research was to develop novel reduced-fat emulsions based on hetero-aggregation of oppositely charged food−grade colloidal particles or polymers. Initially, lactoferrin (LF) and β-lactoglobulin (β−Lg) were selected as emulsifiers to form protein-coated fat droplets (d 43 ∼ 0. 38 μm) with opposite charges at neutral pH: pKaβ−Lg ∼ 5 3 ̆c pH 7 3 ̆c pKaLF ∼ 8. 5. Droplet aggregation occurred when these two <b>emulsions</b> were <b>mixed</b> together due to electrostatic attraction. The structural organization of the droplets in these <b>mixed</b> <b>emulsions</b> depended on the positive-to-negative particle ratio, particle concentration, pH, ionic strength, and temperature. The nature of the structures formed influenced the rheology, stability, and appearance of the <b>mixed</b> <b>emulsions,</b> which enabled some control over emulsion functionality.

30|$|In summary, {{existing}} oil–water separation {{porous metal filter}} membranes can utilise {{the special}} wettability of the membrane surface to separate an oil–water mixture and has advantages such as high efficiency, portability, high plasticity, high thermal stability, good mechanical property and low cost. However, there are some aspects where these filter membranes need improvement for effective treatments of industrial wastewater and offshore crude oil spills. First, the environmental adaptability of the filter membranes needs to be enhanced and its working stability in extreme conditions, such as strong acid and alkali, high-concentration salt solution and corrosive liquid, needs to be strengthened, and its mechanical strength should be improved {{to adapt to the}} real environment. In addition, the material and modification reagents for fabricating the filter membrane need to be eco-friendly during fabrication and application processes. Furthermore, the fabricating process should be simple, and the manufacturing cost should be reasonable {{to meet the needs of}} large-scale production. 3 D printing technology has shown outstanding advantages, such as waste minimization, freedom of design, mass customization and the ability to manufacture complex structures [85]. Biomimetic super-hydrophobic structure [86] and superhydrophobic PLA membrane [87] have been printed for oil-water separation. Those results show that 3 D printing technology made fabrication process of complex micro-nano structure become easier. Based on this technology, oil-water separation membrane with higher efficient can be gotten in the future. Finally, when the oil–water mixture is in an emulsion state, the filter membrane needs to maintain the oil–water separation capability. An oil–water <b>mixed</b> <b>emulsion</b> is generally defined as oil–water dispersion [88] with a droplet diameter of less than 20  μm, and existing studies of oil–water separation by porous metal filter membranes rarely report the separating conditions for a mixed liquid in an emulsion state. Jiang et al. [52] prepared a superhydrophilic–underwater superoleophobic stainless steel mesh that can preliminarily separate oil–water mixed emulsions using a one-step solution coating method with methyltrimethoxysilane, but this filter membrane cannot completely separate oil–water mixture emulsions, since the apertures of many existing oil–water separation porous metal filter membranes are too large. This remains an urgent challenge in the field of oil–water separation by porous metal filter membranes that need to be solved.|$|E

40|$|The {{emulsification}} performance, {{stability and}} competitive adsorption of two natural food emulsifiers, sugar beet pectin (SBP) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) have been investigated. Both {{can reduce the}} surface tension and emulsify oil in water. However, due to their different structure and conformation they operate via different mechanisms. Using 15 % middle chain triglycerides (MCTs) oil, the amounts of SBP and HPMC adsorbed in emulsions made with these individually and in mixtures were determined. The interfacial concentration (Γ) for SBP stabilized emulsion was ∼ 1. 25 mg/m 2 and for HPMC 3. 5 mg/m 2. The higher adsorption of HPMC was due to multilayer adsorption, whereas SBP adsorbed as a monolayer. Competitive adsorption between SBP and HPMC was also investigated. When the HPMC concentration approached that of adsorbed SBP, the effect of HPMC became dominant and at 1. 5 wt. % controlled the behaviour of the <b>mixed</b> <b>emulsions,</b> which were then almost independent of SBP. The minor role of SBP was mainly to decrease the proportion of large droplets in the emulsion. A model to describe the competitive adsorption between SBP and HPMC is propose...|$|R

40|$|Emulsifiers {{are used}} in ice cream to produce a dry, smooth {{textured}} product with desireable melting properties. They function by promoting a partial destabilization of the fat emulsion. Polyoxythylene sorbitan monooleate is used very commonly in the ice cream industry for this purpose. The objective {{of this research was}} to examine by transmission electron microscopy the differences in the fat globules in typical ice cream <b>mix</b> <b>emulsions</b> prepared with and without 0. 08 % polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. Ice cream mix was combined 3 : 1 with a 2 % solultion of ultralow gelling temperature agarose at 20 degrees C, fixed with 4 % glutaraldehyde, postfixed with 1 % OsO 4 in imidazole/phosphate buffer, embedded in Spurr resin and thin-sectioned for viewing. The emulsifier reduced the number of casein micelles adsorbed to the fat globules as determined by both TEM and quantification of membrane protein with Kjeldahl analyses. The fat/Serum interfacial tension was also significantly reduced by the presence of emulsifier in the mix. The data suggest that emulsifiers promote fat destabilization through reduction of membrane protein, based on their ability to reduce the fat serum interfacial tension. In the presence of crystallized fat, the emulsion then becomes less stable to shear forces during the whipping and freezing of ice cream...|$|R

40|$|This paper describes, {{more fully}} than our {{preliminary}} communication (1), a filterable agent resembling the viruses which produces extensive necrosis and suppuration in certain tissues {{of the white}} rat. One of us (2) has been carrying on for some years a search for antibodies against sarcoma 39 in rats which had cured themselves of this neoplasm, <b>mixing</b> <b>emulsions</b> of the tumor before inoculation with various organs of the rat or with adsorbents employed to remove an antibody from tissue extracts, or incubating them in such extracts or in Locke-Ringer solution. Though all materials had been proved sterile before use by ordinary bacteriological methods, large abscesses sometimes developed {{within a few days}} at the site where these tumor emulsions had been injected. This complication, which arose about twenty times in some 100 instances at irregular intervals throughout the course of five or six years, was at first ascribed to bacterial contamination, for which the requisite manipulations gave abundant opportunity. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures of the pus, however, were repeatedly negative in plain broth, dextrose broth, streptococcus broth, Rosenow's brain broth, Loeflier's blood serum, Huntoon's hormone medium, plain agar, blood agar, dextrose agar slants, Petroff's egg medium, blood plates in 10 per cent carbon dioxide, and the Bordet-Gengou medium.

RESULTS: The mean cholesterol in the 10 % group was significantly higher within the first seven days of the study compared with the 20 % group (3. 5 vs 2. 87 mmol/l), and continued to rise over the study period in contrast to the 20 % group. A similar pattern was observed with the triglyceride concentrations. There {{was no significant difference in}} non-esterified fatty acids, beta hydroxy butyrate, or growth between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Sick neonates show better biochemical tolerance to 20 % MCT/LCT emulsion than to 10 % emulsion...|$|R

The effect of oil-volume fraction (2. 5 % w/w to 10 % w/w), salivary protein concentration (0. 1 to 0. 8 mg ml(- 1)), {{and the use of}} both stimulated and unstimulated saliva was investigated. Viscosity and storage modulus were measured before (eta(emul) and G'(emul), respectively) and after addition of saliva (eta(mix) and G'(mix)). To better estimate the changes due to saliva-induced flocculation of the emulsions, the ratios eta(mix) /eta(emul), G'(mix) /G'(emul) were calculated. In addition, tan delta (=the ratio of the loss and storage moduli) was investigated to evaluate the viscoelastic behavior of the emulsion/saliva mixtures. Increasing the oil-volume fraction and salivary protein concentration resulted in an increase in eta(mix) /eta(emul) and G'(mix) /G'(emul), while a decrease in tan delta of the emulsion/saliva mixtures is occurring. When compared with unstimulated saliva, <b>mixing</b> beta-lactoglobulin-stabilized <b>emulsions</b> with stimulated saliva led to a reduction in eta(mix) /eta(emul) and G'(mix) /G'(emul), and an augment of tan delta at all measured deformations. In case of lysozyme-stabilized emulsions, the use of stimulated saliva increased G'(mix) /G'(emul) for gamm...|$|R
