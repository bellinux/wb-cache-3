500|$|Several writers {{felt that}} the novel left much to be desired {{following}} Fitzgerald's previous works and promptly criticized him. Harvey Eagleton of The Dallas Morning News believed the novel signaled the end of Fitzgerald's success: [...] "One finishes Great Gatsby {{with a feeling of}} regret, not for the fate {{of the people in the}} book, but for Mr. Fitzgerald." [...] John McClure of The Times-Picayune said that the book was unconvincing, writing, [...] "Even in conception and construction, The Great Gatsby seems a little raw." [...] Ralph Coghlan of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch felt the book lacked what made Fitzgerald's earlier novels endearing and called the book [...] "a minor performance... At the moment, its author seems a bit bored and tired and cynical." [...] Ruth Snyder of New York Evening World called the book's style [...] "painfully forced", noting that the editors of the paper were [...] "quite convinced after reading The Great Gatsby that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Fitzgerald</b> is not one of the great American writers of to-day." [...] The reviews struck Fitzgerald as completely missing the point: [...] "All the reviews, even the most enthusiastic, not one had the slightest idea what the book was about." ...|$|E

2500|$|The electors are now {{asked to}} return a gentleman to Parliament who is rightly {{considered}} unfit for the public service, who was, in fact, if not in name, dismissed for conduct {{for which there is}} no excuse. He is quite competent to be a member of the House, but incompetent to sit on the Magistrate's Bench! Is Parliament become a refuge for the destitute? Is the Insolvency Court a half-way house to the Legislature? Does a long experience of questionable company tend to qualify a man to represent a large constituency in Parliament? <b>Mr</b> <b>Fitzgerald</b> is well known to every one in Hokitika and on the Coast. Why should he show his contempt for this constituency by offering them his services? ...|$|E

2500|$|After hearing {{testimony}} from the repair shop employee that [...] "the repair shop had {{no record of}} Berardelli picking up the gun, the gun {{was not in the}} shop nor had it been sold", the defense put Vanzetti on the stand where he testified that [...] "he had actually bought the gun several months earlier from fellow anarchist Luigi Falzini for five dollars" [...] – in contradiction to what he had told police upon his arrest. This was corroborated by Luigi Falzini (Falsini), a friend of Vanzetti's and a fellow Galleanist, who stated that, after buying the [...]38 revolver from one Riccardo Orciani, he sold it to Vanzetti. The defense also called two expert witnesses, a Mr. Burns and a <b>Mr.</b> <b>Fitzgerald,</b> who each testified that no new spring and hammer had ever been installed in the revolver found in Vanzetti's possession.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2007, Fitzgerald [...] "was {{ranked among}} {{prosecutors}} who had 'not distinguished themselves' {{as opposed to}} [...] "'strong U.S. Attorneys [...] [...] [...] who exhibited loyalty' to the administration" [...] on a Justice Department chart sent to the White House in March 2005..." [...] This was revealed in light of {{an investigation of the}} December 2006 firings of several U.S. Attorneys by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, perceived as being politically motivated and despite his previous Attorney General's Award for Distinguished Service in 2002. Two other prosecutors so ranked were dismissed. On July 2, 2007, President Bush provided a statement on his decision to commute Mr. Libby's prison sentence and noted:"After the investigation was under way, the Justice Department appointed United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois Patrick Fitzgerald as a Special Counsel in charge of the case. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Fitzgerald</b> is a highly qualified, professional prosecutor who carried out his responsibilities as charged." ...|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Rove {{failed to}} tell the grand jury about his conversations with Cooper. According to Rove, he only remembered he had spoken to Cooper after {{discovering}} a July 11, 2003, White House e-mail that Rove had written to then-deputy National Security advisor Stephen J. Hadley in which Rove said he had spoken to Cooper about the Niger controversy. Luskin also testified before the grand jury. He told prosecutors that Time reporter Viveca Novak had told him prior to Rove's first grand jury appearance that she had heard from colleagues at Time that Rove {{was one of the}} sources for Cooper's story about Plame. Luskin in turn said that he told Rove about this, though Rove still did not disclose to the grand jury that he had ever spoken to Cooper about Plame. Viveca Novak testified she couldn't recall when she spoke to Luskin. Rove testified a total of five times before the federal grand jury investigating the leak. After Rove's last appearance, Luskin released a statement that read in part: [...] "In connection with this appearance, the special counsel has advised Mr. Rove that he is not a target of the investigation. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Fitzgerald</b> has affirmed that he has made no decision concerning charges." ...|$|E

60|$|Not so {{with her}} sister. The sufferings of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Fitzgerald</b> {{had taken a}} strong hold on her {{youthful}} feelings, and a similarity of opinions and practices on the great object of their lives, had brought them together in a manner no misconduct in a third person could weaken. It is true, the recollection of Denbigh was intimately blended with the fate of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Fitzgerald.</b> But Emily sought support against her feeling from a quarter that rather required an investigation of them than a desire to drown care with thought.|$|R

6000|$|The text of {{this edition}} of Swift's notes on Clarendon has been founded on the careful {{transcript}} made by Mr. Percy Fitzgerald. This transcript is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, South Kensington. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Fitzgerald</b> refers to Dr. Rowan's collation, but I have been unable to find the original of this. Rowan's additions, however, were noted by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Fitzgerald,</b> and they have been included here. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Fitzgerald</b> says: [...] "Scott's notes, subject to the corrections just given [by himself], are correct, and would serve as the base of the new edition. The additions I have given and the few given by Dr. Rowan (which are given here a little further on) will have to be inserted in their proper places and will make the whole complete." [...] This has been done, and the present reprint is a very careful following out of this suggestion.|$|E

60|$|The {{visit to}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Fitzgerald</b> had been {{postponed}} in consequence of Jane's indisposition; but {{a week after}} the colonel's departure, Mrs. Wilson thought, as Jane had consented to leave her room, and Emily really began to look pale from her confinement by the side of a sick bed, she would redeem the pledge she had given the recluse on the following morning. They found the ladies at the cottage happy to see them, and anxious to hear of the health of Jane, of whose illness they had been informed by note.
