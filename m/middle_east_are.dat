Models sold in Australia, Europe and South Africa use the more sophisticated New MC underpinnings, and are thus designated as E150.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the first Middle Eastern farmers had North African influences mainly from The Capsian culture. There have been suggestions that some genetic lineages found in the Middle East arrived there during this period.

500|$|OPEC {{often has}} {{difficulty}} agreeing on policy decisions because its member countries differ widely in their oil export capacities, production costs, reserves, geological features, population, economic development, budgetary situations, and political circumstances. Indeed, {{over the course}} of market cycles, oil reserves can themselves become a source of serious conflict, instability and imbalances, in what economists call the [...] "natural resource curse". A further complication is that religion-linked conflicts in the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>are</b> recurring features of the geopolitical landscape for this oil-rich region. Internationally important conflicts in OPEC's history have included the Six-Day War (1967), Yom Kippur War (1973), a hostage siege directed by Palestinian militants (1975), the Iranian Revolution (1979), Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988), Iraqi occupation of Kuwait (1990–1991), September 11 attacks by mostly Saudi hijackers (2001), American occupation of Iraq (2003–2011), Conflict in the Niger Delta (2004–present), Arab Spring (2010–2012), Libyan Crisis (2011–present), and international Embargo against Iran (2012–2016). Although events such as these can temporarily disrupt oil supplies and elevate prices, the frequent disputes and instabilities tend to limit OPEC's long-term cohesion and effectiveness.|$|E
