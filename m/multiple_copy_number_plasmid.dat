40|$|Colicin N was {{identified}} as the 39, 000 -molecular-weight protein encoded by the 4, 900 -base-pair, <b>multiple</b> <b>copy</b> <b>number,</b> amplifiable <b>plasmid</b> ColN - 284. Its production was controlled by the SOS regulatory circuit and by catabolite repression. Colicin accumulated intracellularly to ca. 10 (6) molecules per cell after growth for 2 to 3 h in medium containing 0. 5 microgram of mitomycin C per ml and was then released as the cells underwent partial lysis. Strains carrying pColN - 284 and its derivatives exhibited low-level immunity to colicin N and were fully sensitive to all other colicins tested. Regions of the plasmid responsible for colicin N activity (cna), for mitomycin-induced lysis (cnl), and for colicin N immunity (cni) were localized and characterized by cloning, transposon Tn 5 and hydroxylamine mutagenesis, and restriction endonuclease deletion and mapping analysis. The results are {{discussed in terms of}} both the organization of the cna, cnl, and cni genes and the respective role of cnl expression and colicin N production in mitomycin sensitivity, colicin export, and induced partial lysis of ColN + cells...|$|R
40|$|Results {{presented}} here and by others {{indicate that the}} release of colicins from producing cells can be uncoupled from the decline in culture turbidity which usually occurs within 2 - 3 h after the induction of colicin synthesis. This excludes lysis as a necessary event in colicin release. Conversely, the failure to dissociate colicin release from the normally simultaneous release of a specific subset of soluble proteins argues against {{the idea of a}} specific colicin secretion system sensu-stricto. Rather, colicin release appears to be a consequence of semi-specific leakage resulting from an alteration of the permeability properties of the cell envelope. This alteration is caused by the 'lysis protein' known to be encoded by most <b>multiple</b> <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> Col <b>plasmids.</b> The finding that the expression of the lysis gene of plasmid ColE 2 renders the cells exquisitely sensitive to lysozyme demonstrates that the permeability of the outer membrane must indeed be altered. Evidence is presented that this alteration could be due at least in part to the activation of the detergent-resistant phospholipase A (pldA product). Lysophosphatidylethanolamine, a product of the action of phospholipase on phosphatidylethanolamine, is a membrane perturbant which could alter the permeability properties of the envelope and allow some proteins such as colicin to leak out of the cell...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to examine if the extent of {{resistance}} in E. coli MG 1655 is depending on which kind of plasmid the resistance gene is placed on, a high <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> <b>plasmid</b> or a low <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> <b>plasmid.</b> We wish {{to see if the}} <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> makes a difference, as it so far never has been examined whether the amount of antibiotics needed to prevent the bacteria from growing is determined by the <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> of the <b>plasmids</b> or not. Furthermore, we wish to see if the specific target of the different antibiotics has an effect on the extent of resistance. We have chosen to work with three different antibiotics; tetracycline, ampicillin and chloramphenicol. The reason for selecting these antibiotics is that they each have different targets, and therefore uses different mechanisms to inhibit the bacteria's growth. This means that the bacteria have to use different methods to inactivate each of the antibiotics. Our method is to insert resistance genes towards the three antibiotics to both a high copy plasmid and a low copy plasmid. These plasmids are then transformed into MG 1655. Finally we use MIC measurements to compare the extent of resistance. To make an MIC measurement means to measure the lowest amount of antibiotics needed to inhibit the bacteria's growth. We started by assuming that the resistance of tetracycline would depend of the <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> of the used plasmid and the resistance of ampicillin and chloramphenicol would not. We based this theory on our knowledge about their mechanisms, respectively. Unfortunately we only succeeded in getting clear results from the experiment with ampicillin. These results showed that the extent of resistance in the case of ampicillin and its corresponding resistance gene ampR is depending on, whether ampR is placed on a high <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> <b>plasmid</b> or a low <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> <b>plasmid.</b> In the case with chloramphenicol and cat, our results indicate that the resistance is not depending on the <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> of the <b>plasmid.</b> However, one of our plasmids did not have a completely correct insert, so the experiment will have to be repeated before anything can be concluded.

40|$|All genes {{critical}} for plasmid replication regulation {{are located on}} the plasmid {{rather than on the}} host chromosome. It is possible therefore that there can be copy-up "cheater" mutants. In spite of this possibility, low <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> <b>plasmids</b> appear to exist stably in host populations. We examined this paradox using a multilevel selection model. Simulations showed that, a slightly higher <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> mutant could out-compete the wild type. Consequently, another mutant with still higher <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> could invade the first invader. However, the realized benefit of increasing intra-host fitness was saturating whereas that of inter-host fitness was exponential. As a result, above a threshold, intra-host selection was overcompensated by inter-host selection and the low <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> wild type <b>plasmid</b> could back invade a very high <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> <b>plasmid.</b> This led to a rock-paper-scissor (RPS) like situation that allowed the coexistence of <b>plasmids</b> with varied <b>copy</b> <b>numbers.</b> Furthermore, another type of cheater that had lost the genes required for conjugation but could hitchhike on a conjugal plasmid, could further reduce the advantage of copy-up mutants.

40|$|Uropathogenic Escherichia coli are a {{significant}} cause of urinary tract infections because {{of their ability to}} bind to uroepithelial cells. Long, thin appendages called type 1 pili mediate this adherence. The structural gene coding for the pilin monomer units is fimA.

When the invertible element is in the “ON ” position, transcription of fimA occurs, whereas being in the “OFF ” position results in a lack of transcription and a nonpiliated phenotype. Two plasmids containing a fimA-lacZ fusion were tested to try to ascertain how the fimA gene is regulated when E. coli cells are grown under different osmotic conditions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{understanding}} of physiological interactions between plasmid DNA and its host {{is important for}} vector design and host optimization in many biotechnological applications, to our knowledge, global studies on plasmid-host interactions have not been performed to date even for well-characterized plasmids. RESULTS: Escherichia coli cells, either devoid of plasmid DNA or bearing plasmid pOri 1 (with a single ColE 1 replication origin) or plasmid pOri 2 (with double ColE 1 replication origins), were cultured in a chemostat. We used a combination of metabolic flux analysis, DNA microarray and enzyme activity analysis methods to explore differences in the metabolism between these strains. We found {{that the presence of}} plasmids significantly influenced various metabolic pathways in the host cells, e. g. glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway. Expression of rpiA, a gene coding for ribose- 5 -phosphate isomerase A, was considerably decreased in E. coli carrying a high <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> <b>plasmid</b> relative to E. coli carrying a low <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> <b>plasmid</b> and plasmid-free E. coli.

The presence of WSMV in systemically infected wheat plants inoculated with in vitro transcripts was confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction of the WSMV P 3 gene and by accumulation of WSMV coat protein as detected by immunoblotting. Maintenance of the full-length WSMV cDNA in the high <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> <b>plasmid</b> pUC 18 was problematic because of spontaneous rearrangement of WSMV sequences during growth in liquid media for more than ~ 8 h or if the clone was subcultured.

40|$|For {{applications}} from biosensor generation to synthetic biology, {{the ability to}} accurately and quantitatively generate input-output data from biological systems over a wide dynamic range is becoming increasingly important. This study has demonstrated that a simple approach utilising multiple promoters, recognising the same transcriptional activator but with differing affinities, linked to compatible reporter genes can achieve this goal. This simple system highlights that even for complex promoters with multiple binding sites {{we can use the}} ratio of two reporters to obtain accurate and reproducible input-output data for reporters contained on a high <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> <b>plasmid</b> without the need for any background subtraction or accurate determination of cell number. It has also demonstrated that the precise promoter strengths are not too crucial to the design, provided they are significantly different, as taking the ratio of either the high affinity/low affinity or medium affinity/low affinity channels give similar improvements over any single channel alone. The modularity of this system means that {{it should be possible to}} exchange the IPTG inducible promoter and hence place the ntr C* gene under the regulation of any environmentally important promoter. It should also be possible to simply construct different strength promoters for the same transcriptional activator by standard DNA synthesis techniques, therefore allowing direct ratiometric detection of specific active transcription factors. Finally, there is considerable interest in the biosensor field in the use of immobilised cells for field based applications. In these cases, determining the exact number of viable cells present at the time of use may be problematic and obtaining high signal levels may also be essential.

40|$|Here I {{describe}} how cycles of mathematical modelling and experimenting have advanced our quantitative understanding {{of two different}} processes: transcriptional regulation of the floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) in Arabidopsis thaliana and spatial positioning of low <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> <b>plasmids</b> in Escherichia coli. Despite the diversity in biological subjects, my spatiotemporal modelling approach provides a common ground. FLC regulation involves an antisense-mediated chromatin silencing mechanism, where alternative polyadenylation of antisense transcripts is linked to changed histone modifications at the locus and altered expression. Mathematical model predictions of FLC transcriptional dynamics are validated by measurements of total and chromatinbound FLC intronic RNA. This demonstrates that FLC regulation involves a quantitative coordination between transcription initiation and elongation, potentially a general feature of gene regulation in a chromatin context. A quantitative analysis of cellular RNA levels indicates that FLC processing and degradation are well described by Poisson processes. FLC transcription correlates with cell volume, which underlies the large cellular variation in transcript levels. Low <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> <b>plasmids</b> in bacteria require segregation for stable inheritance through cell division. This is often achieved by a parABC locus, comprising an ATPase ParA, DNA-binding protein ParB and a parC region, encoding ParB-binding sites. These components space plasmids equally over the nucleoid, yet the underlying mechanism has not been understood. Here I show mathematically that differences between competing ParA concentrations {{on either side of}} a plasmid can specify regular plasmid positioning. This can be achieved regardless of the exact mechanism of plasmid movement. Experimentally, parABC from E. coli plasmid pB 171 increases plasmid mobility, inconsistent with models based on plasmid diffusion and immobilization. Instead this observation favours a directed motion model.
