50|$|The United States has {{elections}} {{on the state}} and local levels. The <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> is the constitutional body that elects the president, and voters actually vote for the <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> at the state level. In the U.S., the presidential elections at the state-level decide which people shall become <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> for each state, and those <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> in turn cast their votes for the presidential candidates. The first recorded <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> presidential election in the United States was in 1788âˆ’1789, in which George Washington won.|$|R
50|$|The Chamber of Deputies was elected, {{but with}} a high tax qualification. The {{election}} took place in two stages, with voters choosing <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Electoral</b> <b>Colleges,</b> who in turn elected Deputies. <b>Members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Electoral</b> <b>Colleges</b> had to pay 300 Francs a year in direct taxes (Article 40), while Deputies themselves had to pay a direct tax of 1000 Francs a year. As taxes were mainly levied on landed wealth, this restricted the Chamber of Deputies to {{a very small percentage}} of the richest landowners. The representative basis of the French parliament under the Charter was thus much narrower than that which had been used to elect the Estates-General under the ancient regime. Moreover, the Presidents <b>of</b> the <b>Electoral</b> <b>Colleges</b> were appointed by the King, giving the government the ability to influence the outcome of elections.|$|R
