Therefore, {{they have become}} the foundation not only for flexible data center infrastructure but also for commercial Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solutions. However, current providers of virtual infrastructure offer simple mechanisms through which users can ask for immediate allocation of VMs. More sophisticated economic and allocation mechanisms are required so that users can plan ahead and IaaS providers can improve their revenue. This paper introduces OpenPEX, a system that allows users to provision resources ahead of time through advance reservations.

40|$|Abstract: Negotiation {{is a form}} of {{interaction}} in which agents with conflicting preferences try to reach an agreement on an issue <b>by</b> <b>exchanging</b> <b>offers.</b> Since early nineties, the benefits of exchanging arguments, in addition to offers, has been advo-cated in the literature. The idea is that an offer supported by an argument has a better chance to be accepted by another agent. Unfortunately, a little has been done on showing how a new argument may change the status of an offer for an agent. In other words, how an acceptable (resp. rejected) offer becomes rejected (resp. accept-able) for an agent when he receives a new argument from another agent. In this paper, we assume that each negotiating agent is equipped with a particular argument-based decision system. This system assigns a status to each offer {{on the basis of the}} acceptability of their supporting arguments. We will study under which conditions an offer may change its status when a new argument is received and under which conditions this new argument is useless. This amounts to study how the accept-ability of arguments evolves when the decision system is extended by new arguments. Contents...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{financial}} woes of Greece, Ireland, Portugal, {{and other}} nations have reinvigorated {{the debate over whether}} to bail out defaulting countries or, instead, restructure their debt. Bailouts are expensive, both for residents of the nation being bailed out and for parties providing the bailout funds. Because the IMF, which is subsidized by most nations (including the United States), is almost always involved in country debt bailouts, we all share the burden. Yet bailouts are virtually inevitable under the existing international framework; defaults are likely to have systemic consequences, whereas an orderly debt restructuring is currently impractical. This article analyzes and compares debt restructuring alternatives to bailouts. Under a free-market option, sovereign debtors and their creditors attempt to consensually negotiate a debt restructuring, aided by collective-action clauses and <b>by</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>offers</b> with exit consents. Under a statutory option, sovereign debtors and their creditors would be bound by an international convention that sets forth a process to facilitate debt restructuring. The absence of any systematic comparison of these options has made it difficult to facilitate country debt restructurings. This article attempts to provide that comparison...|$|R
40|$|Many {{companies}} {{in recent years}} are seeking new ways to manage their debt liabilities. Companies with outstanding debt securities can engage {{in a variety of}} transactions with bond holders. Choices will depend to some extent on whether or not the company has access to cash and is able to purchase in the open market or through cash tender offer, or if without cash, <b>by</b> making an <b>exchange</b> <b>offer</b> of new securities for existing securities. Often in either case, there is a bond indenture consent solicitation needed to waive or amend existing bond terms, the announcement of which signals management’s intent to the market. Given the increasing prevalence of this practice as a debt management tool, this study seeks to determine whether it is truly perceived to be value enhancing by stockholders. Using an event study of 50 companies announcing bond indenture consent solicitations, we find that shareholders do benefit, and companies appear well served by this practice...|$|R
40|$|Leverage-reducing <b>exchange</b> <b>offers</b> are {{consistently}} {{associated with a}} reduction in shareholder wealth. This study examines the motivations behind these <b>exchange</b> <b>offers</b> {{in light of their}} negative impact on shareholders 2 ̆ 7 wealth by characterizing a sample of 151 firms conducting leverage-decreasing <b>exchange</b> <b>offers</b> between 1980 and 1993 and comparing them with a sample of similar firms that do not undertake such offers. ^ In line with prior findings, I document significantly negative abnormal returns associated with the offer announcements in my sample. I find {{that a majority of the}} firms are financially distressed, as evidenced by low Altman 2 ̆ 7 s Z-scores, and develop a matching sample of firms which are similar to the <b>exchange</b> <b>offer</b> firms in terms of financial distress levels, firm size, and industry classification, and which did not undertake a leverage-reducing <b>exchange</b> <b>offer.</b> ^ The <b>exchange</b> <b>offer</b> firms have significantly lower insider stock ownership than the matching sample, suggesting that managers of the <b>exchange</b> <b>offer</b> firms could have relatively stronger incentives to place their own interests before those of shareholders. The <b>exchange</b> <b>offer</b> firms also generally have larger boards of directors, which are potentially less effective monitors of managerial behavior. Furthermore, logit regression analysis suggests insider ownership plays a significant role in determining whether an <b>exchange</b> <b>offer</b> is conducted <b>by</b> a distressed firm, even when controlling for firm size, capital structure, and the relative amount of public debt outstanding. ^ I find that the prompt liquidation of most of the <b>exchange</b> <b>offer</b> firms would result in a zero payoff to shareholders, indicating that shareholders would generally prefer an <b>exchange</b> <b>offer</b> to liquidation. However, most of the matching firms attempt to weather their financial difficulties without a debt restructuring, and are more successful in avoiding bankruptcy than the <b>exchange</b> <b>offer</b> firms. Thus, a policy of riding out the financial distress might be preferable to an <b>exchange</b> <b>offer.</b> Collectively, the negative shareholder reaction to the offers, lower insider stock ownership, and higher frequency of bankruptcy associated with the <b>exchange</b> <b>offer</b> firms suggest that shareholders of financially distressed firms might favor avoiding leverage-reducing <b>exchange</b> <b>offers.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{described}} in this thesis was to study the removal of ammonium ions from water <b>by</b> ion <b>exchange.</b> The classical technique is to use biological nitrification and denitrification to convert ammonia into nitrogen gas. Removal <b>by</b> ion <b>exchange</b> <b>offers</b> a number of advantages, {{such as the ability}} to handle shock loadings and to polish water to a very high specification. The ion exchanger used in this project was clinoptilolite, a naturally occurring zeolite. Previous research has included characterisation of clinoptilolite, the effect of other common cations on uptake, biological regeneration, and a few other studies. A comparison with other exchangers was also conducted. Much of the available literature is concerned with clinoptilolite and occasionally with mordenite, however modern ion exchangers are polymer based. Two polymeric ion exchangers (Dowex 50 w-x 8, and Purolite MN 500) were evaluated in this project. The main scope of this thesis was to look at the effect that organic pollutants has on ammonium ion removal during ion exchange. The results of batch equilibrations of NH 4 + and the three exchanger resins can be seen in chapter 4. 0. They show that the presence of an organic compound enhanced the uptake of NH 4 + in most cases onto clinoptilolite and Purolite MN 500. There was no apparent uptake onto Dowex 50 w-x 8. Further experiments with a sample of real industrial wastewater (woolscour wastewater) showed varied results, showing that each site should carry out its own pilot scale testing during plant design. Other experimental work showed that the exchanger resins adsorb little or none of the organic compounds in solution. These results can be seen in chapter 5. 0. ii Removal of ammonia from wastewater <b>by</b> ion <b>exchange</b> in the presence of organics. Studies in a packed column showed that the presence of organic compounds had little or no effect on NH 4 + removal. There was however an increase in capacity after each regeneration of the bed and continued removal after breakthrough. The same results were achieved in the control experiment with no organic compounds present, hence these results are not related to the presence of an organic compound. The presence of NH 4 + and various compounds did however provide micro-organisms with substrates from which to grow causing hydraulic difficulties in the column. See chapter 6. 0 for these results. The final section of experimental work studied whether the presence of organic compounds changed the rate of uptake of NH 4 +. The results in chapter 7. 0 show that there was no effect on the rate of NH 4 + uptake...|$|R
