[...] This reaction is relevant to the utility of ZnCl2 solution as a flux for soldering — it dissolves oxide coatings, exposing the clean metal surface. Fluxes with ZnCl2 as an active ingredient are sometimes called [...] "tinner's fluid". Typically this flux was prepared by dissolving zinc foil in dilute hydrochloric acid until the liquid ceased to evolve hydrogen; for this reason, such flux was once known as [...] "killed spirits". Because of its corrosive nature, this flux is not suitable for situations where any residue cannot be cleaned away, such as electronic work.

This study proposed an innovative and low-carbon technology by using <b>magnesia</b> <b>cement</b> and CO 2 curing to transform contaminated wood waste into eco-friendly cement-bonded particleboards, which demonstrated excellent compatibility and value-added properties. The microstructure characteristics and cement hydration chemistry were revealed by mercury intrusion porosimetry and X-ray diffraction analyses. At the optimal water to cement ratio of 0. 3, the particleboards contained the lowest total pore area (10. 2 m(2) g(- 1)) and porosity (26. 1 %), thereby successfully {{complying with the}} International Standards of mechanical strength (> 9 MPa) and dimensional stability (< 2 % swelling after 24 -h water immersion). An integration of 2 -h CO 2 curing facilitated carbonation at early stage and reduced the volume of mesopores and air pores, which contributed to strength development and carbon sequestration in the particleboards (8. 78 % by weight) helping to combat global warming. A subsequent 7 -d air curing further enhanced the strength to outcompete those of 28 -d air curing only, because rehydrated formation filled in capillary pores (reduced from 0. 11 mL g(- 1) to 0. 03 mL g(- 1)).

40|$|Magnesium {{phosphosilicate}} cement (MPSC) {{is a novel}} phosphate bonded cement, {{which consists}} mainly of magnesia, phosphate and silicate minerals. The traditional magnesium phosphate cements (MPCs) usually composed by ammonium phosphate, and gaseous ammonia will emit during mixing and in service. There is no noxious ammonia released from MPSC, furthermore, it can recycle a large volume of the non-hazardous waste. The goal {{of this research is}} to investigate the composition, reaction products, reaction mechanism, microstructure, properties, durability and applications of the MPSC. MPSC sets rapidly and has high early strength. It reacts better with solid industrial waste when compared to Portland cement. Many solid industrial wastes, such as fly ash, steel slag, coal gangue, red coal gangue, red mud, barium-bearing slag, copper slag, silica fume, and ground granulated blast furnace slag, have been used as the main component (40 % by weight) in MPSC. The research has found that these aluminosilicate (or ironsilicate, or calciumsilicate) minerals with an amorphous or glass structure can enhance the performance of MPSC. The disorganized internal structure of amorphous materials may make it possess higher reactivity compared to the crystalline phases. Chemical reaction between phosphate and these minerals may form an amorphous gel, which is favorable to the cementing. Borax, boric acid and sodium tripolyphosphate have been used as retardants in the MPSC system. It is found that boric acid has a higher retarding effect on the setting of cement, than borax does. However, sodium polyphosphate accelerates the reaction of MPSC. The hydration of MPSC is exothermic reaction. The heat evolution may prompt hydrates formation, and shorten the setting process. Modern materials characterization techniques, XRD, DSC, TG-DTA FTIR, XPS, MAS-NMR, SEM, TEM, MIP, etc. were used to analyze the phase composition, micro morphology, and microstructure of hardened MPSC. The main hydration product in MPSC is MgKPO 4 ⋅ 6 H 2 O (MKP), which has both crystalline and amorphous phases. There are many unreacted magnesia grains in the hardened MPSC paste. They act as nucleus of the hardened framework. The hydrates grow around the magnesia grains rims, fill in the voids among the magnesia grains and bond unreacted magnesia part into a solid continuum. The reaction mechanism, such as setting, exothermic reaction and bonding are explained according to the crystallization chemistry, formation thermochernistry, reaction kinetics of MgKPO 4 ⋅ 6 H 2 O, and solid chemistry. The structure of MgKPO 4 ⋅ 6 H 20 consists of PO 43 + tetrahedra, Mg(H 2 O) 62 + octahedra, and K+ groups, held together by hydrogen bonds. Research shows that the formation of MgKPO 4 ⋅ 6 H 20 is especially sensitive to pH value, and the induction and nucleation period seemed very short in MKP formation. During hardening of the cementitous materials, the electrical conductivity of the paste will change with the microstructure formation. In the hydration of MPSC, the conductivity change was monitored by an electrodeless resistivity meter recently developed in HKUST. The results show that the conductivity of MPSC decreases quickly during hydration, which is caused by the rapid setting and hardening process. The smaller the conductivity of the cement paste, the denser is the microstructure, and the higher is the strength development. A micro structural model of the hardened MPSC paste was put forward, according the comprehensive analysis. MPSC has a very low open porosity and low water saturation, but many discrete and closed pores. The special microstructure makes the mechanical properties and durability of MPSC better. Comparing to Portland cement, MPSC has superior deicer freezing-thawing scaling resistance, excellent resistance to high temperature and abrasion, slight expansive in volume instead of shrinkage, rapid strength development under negative temperature, very good chemical corrosion resistance in sulfate solutions and in sea water. Therefore, it is a high performance cementitious material for the sustainable development. MPSC has the similar elastic modulus with Portland cement, very suitable for rapid repair of damaged Portland cement concrete structures. It is also very suitable for shotcrete applications with dry mix process. MPSC can be expediently utilized in civil engineering, military affairs, and environmental protection, etc. Key words: <b>magnesia</b> phosphosiclicate <b>cement,</b> reaction mechanism, microstructure, exothermic reaction, hydration, industrial waste, fly ash, mechanical property, durability, struvite, rapid repair of concrete, sustainable developmen...|$|R

In {{activating}} MgO by electrolyte salts, as {{a result}} of formation of non water-resist magnesium silicate hydrate are obtained the durable cement stone having the low water-resist. I. P. Vyrodov considers [9; 5], that <b>magnesia</b> <b>cement</b> curing in mixing with sufficiently concentrated (C > 20 %) solutions MgCl 2 is caused with the crystallization of oxyhydrochloride composition: 3 MgO∙MgCl 2 ∙ 11 Н 2 О, 5 MgO∙MgCl 2 ∙ 13 Н 2 О and 7 MgO∙MgCl 2 ∙ 15 Н 2 О. In the lower concentration parts of MgCl 2 solution is formed a transitional compound of Mg[(OH) nCl 2 -n] with isomorphous Mg(OH) 2 structure. At very low Cl concentration only Mg(OH) 2 is practically formed. Purpose. The Formation of water-resist magnesium silicate hydrates for obtaining of fast curing and solid structure of the magnesia stone. Conclusion. The dependence of the formation of the magnesia stone from the ratio (MgO/MgCl 2) of the <b>magnesia</b> <b>cement</b> (MgO) and the magnesium chloride solution (MgCl 2) of different density has been identified in order to obtain the best content for oxyhydrochloride 3 MgO•MgCl 2 • 11 Н 2 О, 5 MgO•MgCl 2 • 13 Н 2 О and magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH) 2). In putting into the system MgO∙–∙H 2 О of the silicic acid or fine ground quartz grains with size of less than 20 – 30 microns, over 1 month for the magnesium silicate hydrates formation is needed, where from 2 to 5 % {{of the total number of}} newgrowths are created. The study is proved by the expert opinion, that magnesium silicate hydrates do not have binding properties, unlike calcium silicate hydrates, and the main role in the system curing is played with the Mg(OH) 2 gel recrystallization, which provides the acceptable stone strength (R ≈ 30 MPa) in a few years. It has been also established, that in mixing of cement with low concentration MgO solutions of less than 1, 5 mol/l (or 13 % 1, 1 g/sm 3), the final product in the stone structure is Mg(OH) 2. With increasing the sealer (MgCl 2 solution) there is formed by turn in structure 3 MgO•MgCl 2 • 11 Н 2 О and 5 MgО•MgCl 2 • 13 H 2 О. The increase of the sealer concentration to more than 2, 5 mol/l (C = 21 % or 1, 18 g/sm 3) leads to the formation of system MgО∙–∙MgCl 2 ∙–∙H 2 О consisting of a three phase of pentoxyhydrochloride (5 MgО•MgCl 2 • 13 H 2 О), trioxyhydrochloride (3 MgO•MgCl 2 • 11 Н 2 О), and remains of non-reacted Mg(OH) 2. It has shown in the result of testing that the samples produced from the mixture of cement and bishofit with ρ = 1, 28 g/sm 3 have the bigges strength...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{assesses the}} problem of adverse {{environmental}} impacts due {{to the use of}} Portland cement and structural steel in the construction industry. The thesis outlines three technology and policy strategies to mitigate these impacts: 1. Reduce consumption; 2. Select materials to minimize impacts; and 3. Explore alternative new materials that have lesser impacts. The main findings and recommendations in each of these areas are as follows: Reduce Consumption: While absolute consumption of materials will grow with a growing population, recycling and reuse of structural members can reduce use of virgin material. Since recycling is already widely practiced, reuse of structural members is the primary means of further reducing consumption. Barriers to reuse can be eliminated by establishing design standards and regulations for reuse of structural sections, and creating functioning markets for re-useable sections. Select materials to minimize impacts: While designers are keen to select materials with minimum impacts, they do not have appropriate education or tools for the purpose. Standardization and simplification of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tools, and education of designers are identified as the main areas for improvement. The main recommendations are: i) standardize LCA tools; reduce the number of impact categories, make the categories understandable and incorporate uncertainty data and ii) establish programs for educating designers about materials selection tools. Alternative new materials: New materials with lesser impacts need to be explored. The main recommendations in this area are: i) conduct life cycle assessments of new materials to determine environmental credentials over their lifetime and(cont.) ii) establish appropriate policies enabling market adoption of alternative new technologies. The life cycle assessment of <b>magnesia</b> <b>cement</b> (a mix of cement containing reactive magnesium oxide) is carried out. The assessment concludes that magnesia cements could be a more environmentally friendly alternative than ordinary Portland cement. In summary, this thesis shows that the current consumption trends are not sustainable.

Alternatives to current practices urgently need to be found. by Swati Chaturvedi. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The cement {{industry}} contributes around 5 - 7 % of man-made CO 2 emissions globally {{because of the}} Portland Cement (PC) production. Therefore, innovative reactive <b>magnesia</b> <b>cement,</b> with significant sustainable and technical advantages, has been proposed by blending reactive MgO and hydraulic binders in various proportions. MgO is currently produced from the calcination of magnesite (MgCO 3), emitting more CO 2 than the production of PC, or from seawater/brine which is also extremely energy intensive. Hence this research aims to investigate an innovative method to produce MgO from reject brine, a waste Mg source, through carbon sequestration, by its reaction with CO 2, to provide a comparable low carbon manufacturing process due to the recycling of CO 2. The produced deposits are then calcined to oxides with potential usage in construction industry. The entire system is a closed loop to achieve both environmental optimisation and good productivity. This research focuses on the chemical manufacturing process, integrated with material science knowledge and advancements, instead of concentrating purely on chemistry evaluations. Six series of studies were conducted, utilising MgCl 2, CaCl 2, MgCl 2 -CaCl 2, MgCl 2 -CaCl 2 -NaCl, and MgCl 2 -CaCl 2 -NaCl-KCl to react with CO 2 under alkaline conditions. The precipitates include hydrated magnesium carbonates, calcium carbonates and magnesian calcite. Generated carbonates were then calcined in a furnace to obtain MgO, CaO or dolime (CaO•MgO). All six series of carbonation processes were carried out under a controlled pH level, to study the constant pH’s effect on the process and resulting precipitates. Other controllable factors include pH, temperature, initial concentration, stirring speed, and CO 2 flux rate. In conclusion, the optimum parameters {{for the production of}} the carbonated precipitates are: 0. 25 MgCl 2 + 0. 05 CaCl 2 + 2. 35 NaCl + 0. 05 KCl, 700 rpm stirring speed, 25 oC room temperature, pH= 10. 5, and 500 cm 3 /min CO 2 infusion rate.

40|$|Soil {{contaminated}} with cadmium (Cd) {{is a heavy}} problem {{all over the world}} and especially in Japan, where many crop fields are contaminated. Applicative techniques are required for remediation such soils and reduction of Cd uptake in crops. To evaluate the Cd uptake of taro (Colocasia esculenta Schott cv. Dodare), Japanese radish (Raphanus sativus L. cv. Harunomegumi) and potato (Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Dansyaku) a cultivation experiment was conducted in high Ca-contaminated field. The Ca concentration of the whole plants showed in the order of taro > potato > Japanese radish. In addition, the Cd concentration of the edible parts (daughter corm of taro, Japanese radish root and peeled potato) in each plant was the lowest in those of the other parts. The shoots of Japanese radish and potato accumulated Cd largely as compared with roots during the cultivation. It is concluded that the edible part of Japanese radish root is a safer food material with low cadmium content as compared with the other root crops. The experiment of pot culture was conducted to investigate the Cd, zinc, manganese and copper concentrations of Japanese radishes (Raphanus sativus L. cv. Harunomegumi, and Raphanus sativus L. cv. Akibutai) for 9 weeks with soil, whose cadmium and Zinc concentrations were 3. 26 and 67. 9 mg/kg (in dried soil), respectively. The Japanese radish plants grew normally through the growth period, and the weight of the shoots was 2. 8 times of the roots. The Cd concentrations of shoots increased for 6 weeks after sowing and the increase slowed down after 6 weeks from sowing. After 9 weeks, the cadmium concentrations of the shoots were "Harunomegumi" and “Akibutai”, respectively, 2. 37 and 1. 45 mg/kg. The cadmium concentrations of the shoot “Harunomegumu” were higher 0. 8 kg kg- 1 than those of "Akibutai". It seemed that the Cd concentrations of the shoots depended on the cultivars. The Cd concentrations of the roots were a quarter of those of the shoots. The zinc concentrations of the shoots were same as those of the roots through the growth period. The manganese concentrations of the shoots increased, however, those of the roots were constant values. The copper concentrations of the shoots were higher 1. 4 times than those of the roots. To evaluate the suppressive effect of five additives on cadmium (Cd) uptake by komatsuna (Brassica rapa L. var. perviridis cv. Early komatsuna), a pot experiment with Cd-contaminated acidic soil was conducted in a greenhouse. Autoclaved lightweight aerated concrete (ALC), lherzolite (Lherzo), gypsum made from waste plasterboard (Gyp-w), <b>magnesia</b> <b>cement</b> (Magwhite) and calcium carbonate containing less than 10 % pure gypsum (Cacar-G) were added to the soil (1 %, w/v). The shoot Cd concentrations of the plants were suppressed in the order; Magwhite ≧ Cacar-G > ALC > Lherzo. The order was in agreement with that of the soil pH increased by the application of the additives. The application of Gyp-w suppressed the shoot Cd concentration of the plants similar to Lherzo, however, it reduced the plant growth. It is concluded that Magwhite and Cacar-G are considerably effective soil amendments in the suppression of Cd uptake by the plants, and ALC and Lherzo are moderately effective, whereas Gyp-w is scarcely effective. The development of soil amendments, the improvement of cultivation techniques on the reduction of plant Cd uptake, and the phytoremediation on Cd contaminated soil will propose the avoidance of Cd crisis. 博士 (農学) 農学Iwate University 2010 - 3 - 23 乙　 140...|$|E
