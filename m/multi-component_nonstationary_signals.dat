40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 12 Improving the {{modeling}} and processing of <b>nonstationary</b> <b>signals</b> remains an important yet challenging problem. In the past, {{the most effective}} approach for processing these signals has been statistical modeling. Statistical models can effectively encode domain knowledge and lead to principled algorithms for the fundamental tasks of enhancement, detection, and classification. However, the performance of statistical models can be limited because they inherently make assumptions about {{the distribution of the}} data. Deep neural networks, in contrast, have recently outperformed state-of-the-art statistical models of <b>nonstationary</b> <b>signals.</b> Deep neural networks are completely data-driven, and learn to set their parameters by training on large datasets that are assumed to match the distribution of the data. This dissertation follows two approaches for improving modeling and processing of <b>nonstationary</b> <b>signals.</b> The first approach examines conventional model assumptions and suggests improvements that lead to improved performance for processing <b>nonstationary</b> <b>signals.</b> Specifically, noncircular distributions of the complex-valued short-time Fourier transform are shown to improve detection of realistic <b>nonstationary</b> <b>signals.</b> Then the parameterization of a recently-proposed recurrent neural network for processing <b>nonstationary</b> <b>signals</b> is reexamined. By using an optimization method that preserves the capacity of the recurrence matrix, superior performance is achieved on a battery of benchmarks that test the ability of recurrent neural networks to process <b>nonstationary</b> <b>signals.</b> The second approach uses the recently-proposed framework of deep unfolding, which provides a principled means of transforming statistical model inference algorithms into deep networks. This dissertation expands the deep unfolding framework specifically for <b>nonstationary</b> <b>signals.</b> Using this framework, a model-based explanation is provided for state-of-the-art recurrent neural architectures, including gated recurrent unit and unitary recurrent neural networks. Additionally, deep unfolding results in deep network architectures that arise in principled ways from statistical model assumptions. This statistical model foundation provides initializations for the unfolded networks, which lead to better generalization, faster training, and competitive or superior performance on a variety of tasks, including single- and multichannel acoustic source separation and classification of acoustic signals...|$|R

30|$|Signals can be {{classified}} into different classes based on their characteristics. One such classification is deterministic and random signals. Deterministic signals are those, which can be represented mathematically or in other words all information about the signals are known a priori. Random signals take random values and cannot be expressed in a simple mathematical form like deterministic signals, instead they are represented using their probabilistic statistics. When the statistics of such signals vary over time, they qualify to form another subdivision called <b>nonstationary</b> <b>signals.</b> <b>Nonstationary</b> <b>signals</b> are associated with time-varying spectral content {{and most of the}} real world (including audio) signals fall into this category. Due to the time-varying behavior, it is challenging to analyze <b>nonstationary</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R

This tutorial paper presents an overview of some time-frequency methods for the analysis and processing of <b>nonstationary</b> random <b>signals,</b> with emphasis placed on time-varying power spectra and techniques for signal estimation and detection. We discuss two major definitions of time-dependent power spectra— the generalized Wigner-Ville spectrum and the generalized evolutionary spectrum—and show their approximate equivalence for underspread random processes. Time-dependent power spectra are then applied to <b>nonstationary</b> <b>signal</b> estimation and detection. Specifically, simple expressions and designs of signal estimators (Wiener filters) and signal detectors in the stationary case are extended to underspread nonstationary processes. This results in time-frequency techniques for <b>nonstationary</b> <b>signal</b> estimation and detection which are intuitively meaningful as well as efficient and stable. I...|$|R

The study of the varying spectral content of such signals is possible through two-dimensional functions of TFDs that depict the temporal and spectral contents simultaneously [1]. Different types of TFDs are limited in scope due to multiple reasons, for example, low concentration along the individual components, blurring of autocomponents, cross terms (CTs) appearance in between autocomponents, and poor resolution. These shortcomings result into inaccurate analysis of <b>nonstationary</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{conventional}} time–frequency analysis (TFA) methods, including continuous wavelet transform, short-time Fourier transform, and Wigner–Ville distribution, {{have played}} {{important roles in}} analyzing <b>nonstationary</b> <b>signals.</b> However, they often show less capability in dealing with <b>nonstationary</b> <b>signals</b> with time-varying frequency due to the bad energy concentration in the time–frequency plane. On the other hand, by introducing an extra transform kernel that matches the instantaneous frequency of the signal, parameterized TFA methods show powerful ability in characterizing time–frequency patterns of <b>nonstationary</b> <b>signals</b> with time-varying frequency. In this paper, a novel time–frequency transform, called spline-kernelled chirplet transform (SCT), is proposed. By introducing a frequency-rotate operator and a frequency-shift operator constructed with spline kernel func-tion, the SCT is particularly powerful for the strongly nonlinear frequency-modulated signals. In addition, an effective algorithm is developed to estimate the parameters of transform kernel in the SCT. The capabilities of the SCT and parameter estimation algorithm are validated by their applications for numerical signals {{and a set of}} vibration signal collected from a rotor test rig.
