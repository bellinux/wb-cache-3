40|$|<b>Root</b> <b>rots</b> {{are one of}} {{the main}} biotic {{constraints}} to common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) production, causing losses estimated at 221 000 metric tons a year in sub-Saharan Africa. Until recently, <b>root</b> <b>rots</b> in Ugandan common bean agroecologies were mostly caused by Pythium and Fusarium spp., especially in high altitude areas. But now, severe <b>root</b> <b>rots</b> are observed in low and medium altitude agroecologies characterized by dry and warm conditions. The objective of our study was therefore to ascertain the current prevalence and incidence of common bean <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> diseases in Ugandan common bean agroecologies. Our results show that <b>root</b> <b>rots</b> were present in all seven agroecologies surveyed. Overall, the most rampant <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> was southern blight caused by Sclerotium rolfsii Sacc., followed by <b>root</b> <b>rots</b> caused by Fusarium spp., Pythium spp. and Rhizoctonia solani, respectively.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 <b>Root</b> <b>rot</b> {{diseases}} of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) {{are a problem}} wherever they are grown, and are a major constraint to dry edible and snap bean production. <b>Root</b> <b>rot</b> is a primary yield limitation of snap bean production in the US, especially within the top three snap bean producing states of Wisconsin, Oregon and New York. Bean <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> pathogens will be present {{by the end of}} the first season even when starting with clean ground. The decline in yield can be relatively slow, so growers might not notice or appreciate the hidden yield cost associated with <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> disease. Traditional methods for disease control such as fungicides, crop rotations, cover crops, seedbed preparations have been proven ineffective (either physically ineffective or economically unviable) against <b>root</b> <b>rot.</b> Therefore, genetic resistance is needed. In order to address the need for genetic resistance to <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> in snap beans, the highly <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> resistant line RR 6950, a small seeded black indeterminate type IIIA accession of unknown origin, was crossed with OSU 5446, a highly <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> susceptible determinate type I blue lake four-sieve breeding line to produce the RR 138 recombinant inbred mapping population. In this study we evaluated the RR 138 RI population in the Fâ‚† generation for resistance to Fusarium solani <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> in Oregon and Aphanomyces euteiches <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> in Wisconsin. We also evaluated this population for morphological traits and root structural traits including pod height, pod width, pod length, pod wall thickness, strings, seed color, flower color, tap and basal root diameter, and root angle measurements.

Soil-borne inoculum of both F. culmorum did not affect seedling emergence but did cause <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> and reduced grain yield.

Both snap beans and dry beans are affected. <b>Root</b> <b>rot</b> diseases {{can be caused by}} a variety of pathogens; however, Fusarium solani is a common causal agent. Fusarium <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> is a primary yield limitation of snap bean production in Oregon. Cultural control methods are ineffective and the pathogen will be present {{at the end of one}} season of production on previously clean land, indicating the need for genetic resistance. In order to address this need, a diversity panel of 148 snap bean varieties (the BeanCAP Snap Bean Diversity Panel) was evaluated for resistance to Fusarium <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> in Oregon. Morphological traits potentially involved in <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> resistance were also evaluated. Genome-wide association studies were conducted to locate SNPs associated with Fusarium <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> resistance, aboveground biomass, adventitious roots, taproot diameter, basal root diameter, deepest root angle, shallowest root angle, root angle average, root angle difference, and root angle geometric mean. Significant associations were located for all traits evaluated, including associations with <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> resistance on Pv 02, Pv 08, Pv 09, and Pv 10. Genomic estimated breeding values based on BLUPs and BLUEs were generated for each variety and trait. In order to investigate the genetic architecture of the diversity panel principal component analysis, a kinship heat map, and a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree were generated. The first principal component axis separated varieties by center of domestication, while the second principal component axis separated European extra-fine beans from other Mesoamerican varieties. Kinship analysis demonstrated an average similarity coefficient between varieties of 0. 67. The phylogenetic tree indicated two separate derivations of snap beans with extensive subsequent recombination.

40|$|Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} economic crop which is attacked by serious diseases such as Fusarium <b>root</b> <b>rot.</b> In this study, the efficacy of Trichoderma viride and T. koningii were evaluated for the suppression of Fusarium oxysporum causing <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> of beans in vitro and disease control under greenhouse condition. Three food carriers - broken dehulled rice grain, sorghum seeds, and vermiculite were also evaluated for suitability as growth and delivery media for Trichoderma isolates as determined by the sporulation ability and <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> control respectively. In vitro studies resulted in effective suppression of F. oxysporum by the two Trichoderma isolates. Saprophytic growth on rice and sorghum was good at two weeks but poor on vermiculite. T. viride in half broken dehulled rice produced excellent bean <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> control as measured by disease severity at 7 th week and was significantly (Pâ‰¤ 0. 05) better than standard seed dresser Murtano (20 % Thiram and 20 % Lindane); T. koningii and T. viride in sorghum, and T. koningii in rice had moderate disease control whilst the two Trichoderma isolates in vermiculite had poor disease control. There was some positive correlation between saprophytic growth of Trichoderma isolates in different carriers in the laboratory and their suppression of Fusarium <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> in the greenhouse. The results of this study indicates that potential exist for management of Fusarium <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> in beans by antagonistic Trichoderma isolates in their respective carriers and may form part of IPM for bean <b>root</b> <b>rot...</b>|$|R
40|$|Damping off {{and chronic}} <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> of sugar beet caused by Aphanomyces cochlioides {{is a major}} {{constraint}} in cultivation of sugar beet, with occurrence of the disease in Sweden being concentrated to specific areas. This study examined soil factors {{that can be used}} for risk assessment of Aphanomyces <b>root</b> <b>rot.</b> Soils from 134 field plots were assessed over three years for Aphanomyces <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> potential in bioassays and analysed for easily measured soil factors such as soluble nutrients, pH and soil electrical conductivity (EC). Classification of the field plots into four groups with increasing disease severity index (DSI) according to the bioassay revealed that the group with the lowest DSI (40. From these results, we concluded that soil Ca concentration is an easily measured factor that can be used to identify soils with an increased risk of Aphanomyces <b>root</b> <b>rot.</b> We suggest that the Ca content should be above 250 mg Ca/ 100 g soil to avoid problems with Aphanomyces <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> in sugar beet. To gain a more thorough understanding of the geographical variation in Aphanomyces <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> and its connection to the geological origin of the soils, a number of other soil factors were analysed in the field plots, including clay mineralogy, CEC, and particle size distribution. Aphanomyces <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> was very rare in soils with a high proportion of smectite and vermiculite relative to illite and kaolin minerals, here predominantly calcareous soils developed on clay till in south-western Scania.
