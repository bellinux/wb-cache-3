2500|$|... "Satchel Ass" [...] or [...] "Bucket Butt" [...] or [...] "My Fat-assed Kid". That's how he {{introduced}} me to his cronies when he dragged me along to the studio or racetrack... By the time I was ten or eleven he had stepped up his campaign by adding lickings to the regimen. Each Tuesday afternoon he weighed me in, and if the scale read more than it should have, he ordered <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> office and had me drop my trousers... I dropped my pants, pulled down my undershorts and bent over. Then he went at it with the belt dotted with metal studs he kept reserved for the occasion. Quite dispassionately, without the least display of emotion or loss of self-control, he whacked away until he drew the first drop of blood, and then he stopped. It normally took between twelve and fifteen strokes. As they came down I counted them off {{one by one and}} hoped I would bleed early...|$|E
2500|$|June Juanico [...] "recalls a {{time when}} she stood up to Elvis in front of his band of hangers-on, who even then were {{beginning}} to accompany him everywhere. He grabbed her arm, took her into the bathroom and declared: 'Look, you are so right, I am really sorry.' He kept her there for five minutes, then swaggered out, his image intact." [...] Julie Parrish, Presley's co-star in Paradise Hawaiian Style, relates, [...] "One time on set I had a real pain in my side – a side-effect, I think – and Elvis scooped me up, carried <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> trailer and shut the door. Outside the crew was waiting and wondering, but Elvis was oblivious to the innuendo. He placed his hand over my side and tried to do some healing on me." [...] Playboy star and actress June Wilkinson remembered that she [...] "met Elvis on the set of King Creole. He invited me to dinner at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. ... Then Elvis gave me a tour of his suite, sat me on the bed in his bedroom and sang to me for two hours. That was it. The next day ... we had dinner again. He was very sweet, and he was friendly. He had more than sex on his mind. He got me to the airport on time, and our paths never crossed again." ...|$|E
60|$|He seemed dubious, for a moment, {{whether to}} take <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> confidence.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But {{he knows}} me very well,' replied Neangir, 'for he has {{recognised}} me as his son. Come with <b>me</b> now, <b>into</b> <b>his</b> presence.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a bit, not a bit," [...] he cried, as {{he pulled}} off the chauffeur's coat and shoved <b>me</b> <b>into</b> it. <b>His</b> face beamed with true German generosity.|$|R
60|$|And my Uncle Felix motioned <b>me</b> majestically <b>into</b> <b>his</b> {{office with}} one hand, while {{with the other}} he pointed in bitter scorn at the floor.|$|R
60|$|When I {{reached the}} foot of the stairs, my father called <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> study.|$|E
60|$|The {{second mate}} {{put his hand}} upon my sleeve and drew <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> cabin.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Harrison and {{the little}} girl had {{disappeared}} up the stairs. Mr. Harrison ushered <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> library and motioned me to a seat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, yes. He took <b>me</b> partly <b>into</b> <b>his</b> confidence. I congratulate you, Laura, {{with all}} my heart, for {{you will be a}} very wealthy woman." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 2 Timothy 4:18 - The Lord will {{rescue me}} from every evil deed and bring <b>me</b> safely <b>into</b> <b>his</b> heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen. (ESV) ...|$|R
60|$|He took <b>me</b> {{out again}} <b>into</b> <b>his</b> garden after supper, {{and we walked}} beneath the trees.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} heard it in {{connection}} with my husband," [...] she declared, frowning slightly. [...] "Henry does not always take <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> confidence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} Geoffrey and I have quarreled {{since he took}} <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> {{confidence}}. I am doubly bound to respect his confidence after that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is quite}} another thing," [...] said Isa, laughing. [...] "But if so, he has not taken <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> confidence. Perhaps he has you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After Mother Hubbard {{had given}} me a good dinner, and I had eaten some of the most delicious clover I have ever tasted, Santa took <b>me</b> up <b>into</b> <b>his</b> work-room and sat me upon the table.|$|R
60|$|The philosopher {{looked a}} little {{astonished}} at my request, as if the washing of hands at irregular times and seasons offered a comparatively new subject of contemplation to him; but he rang a hand-bell on his table immediately, and told the old servant to take <b>me</b> up <b>into</b> <b>his</b> bedroom.|$|R
5000|$|John Bush of AllMusic {{gave the}} album 4 stars out of 5 and called Mark Bell [...] "the most imaginative {{producer}} in British techno." [...] Dominique Leone of Pitchfork gave the album a 7.3 out of 10, writing, [...] "Bell's strength seems {{to reside in}} his softer sides that fools <b>me</b> <b>into</b> thinking <b>his</b> more extroverted outings are lacking." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Oliver smiled. [...] "You needn't hesitate. My brother {{generally}} takes <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> confidence, and I don't {{think either}} of us is very easily startled." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you wouldn't mind {{getting into}} my buggy, and letting <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> lordship's gig, {{you could be}} {{following}} us on, Mr Armstrong," [...] suggested Colligan.|$|E
60|$|As I {{was head}} clerk, I had {{occasion}} to be frequently in Brough's room, and he now seemed once more disposed to take <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> confidence.|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{the more}} need of my helping {{him to do}} both. He cannot shun me long with no hiding-place to fly to but the sea, and I will so gently {{constrain}} him by the old-time love we bore each other, that he must relent and take <b>me</b> back <b>into</b> <b>his</b> heart again." ...|$|R
60|$|But his words, {{despite the}} unsavoury thing {{of which they}} seemed to hold a promise, fell sweetly on my ear, inasmuch as for the time they {{relieved}} my fears touching Madonna. It was not to advise me of her capture {{that he had had}} <b>me</b> haled <b>into</b> <b>his</b> odious presence. I gathered courage.|$|R
60|$|I seized it. He {{instantly}} stooped down, grasped Okandaga {{round the}} waist, and without stopping, swung her, with an exertion of strength {{that seemed to}} <b>me</b> incredible, <b>into</b> <b>his</b> arms. We gained {{the mouth of the}} cavern; Jack dropped Okandaga, who immediately ran in, {{while the rest of us}} stopped abruptly and faced about.|$|R
6000|$|... "My husband's {{friends are}} not my friends," [...] she rejoined, a little bitterly, [...] "nor does he take <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> {{confidence}} as regards his business exploits." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come up {{and have}} some breakfast with me," [...] said Mortimer, and he took <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> own chambers.--"Now, what DO you think of this, Jackson?" [...] he asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "Margharita!" [...] he cried, taking <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> arms, [...] "there {{is death}} before us, {{and it is}} I who have brought it upon you. Oh, my love, my love!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Elizabeth," [...] he said, [...] "I do {{not think}} that he means it kindly. Mathers took <b>me</b> up <b>into</b> <b>his</b> room. He has made {{something}} there which looks like a scaffold. The doll was hanging by a piece of string from the gallows. Elizabeth!--my God, but it was like you!" [...] he cried, suddenly dropping his head upon his arms.|$|R
60|$|After {{the boy was}} {{despatched}} for {{the things}} and my horse taken care of, we sat {{for half an hour}} in the kitchen sipping maté and conversing very agreeably. Then my host took <b>me</b> out <b>into</b> <b>his</b> garden behind the house to be out of his wife's way while she was engaged cooking breakfast, and there he began talking in English.|$|R
6000|$|... "He said {{enough to}} lay bare his whole character. Our subject was anti-rent, which he {{commenced}} {{with a view}} to explain it to a foreigner; but I managed to lead him on, step by step, until he let <b>me</b> <b>into</b> all <b>his</b> notions and expectations on the subject. Why, Hugh, the villain actually proposed that you and I should enlist, and turn ourselves into two of the rascally mock redskins." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My lord, {{you must}} have been misinformed. I know nothing of any such {{correspondence}} and, if it really went on, I think the Peishwa would have taken <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> confidence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not she! She held off, {{and thanked}} her preserver; {{but she would}} be true, she said, to her lover in cocky. But before that Mr. Jephson had taken <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> confidence.' ...|$|E
6000|$|That made me thrill with pleasure. That he, Margaret's father, would so take <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> {{confidence}} made it possible.... The business-like, every-day alertness of {{his voice}} as he spoke next quite recalled me: ...|$|E
60|$|He {{caught me}} by the wrist, and forced <b>me</b> to look <b>into</b> <b>his</b> face. It was unwise of him to touch me against my will, for the fire flashed into my eyes, and my anger gave me strength.|$|R
5000|$|Mark Latham {{wrote of}} Ross Cameron in 1997: [...] "Ross Cameron, the {{brilliant}} but creepy Liberal member for Parramatta, has talked <b>me</b> <b>into</b> participating in <b>his</b> youth leadership forum in Canberra. I rather suspect it's a front for mobilising Christian soldiers, plus some quality box for Ross".|$|R
6000|$|... 'The idea!' said Mrs Chick, 'of your having basked at my brother's fireside, like a serpent, {{and wound}} yourself, through <b>me,</b> almost <b>into</b> <b>his</b> confidence, Lucretia, that you might, in secret, {{entertain}} designs upon him, and dare {{to aspire to}} contemplate the possibility of his uniting himself to you! Why, it is an idea,' said Mrs Chick, with sarcastic dignity, 'the absurdity of which almost relieves its treachery.' ...|$|R
