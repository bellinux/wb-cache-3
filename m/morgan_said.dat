In a 2008 {{interview with the}} Star Tribune, CEO John <b>Morgan</b> <b>said</b> Winmark plowed the $9 million to $10 million in profit from its franchisees into Wirth Business Credit because they believed leasing supplies will become a profitable business even though the current growth had been slow.

5|$|A 2001 {{article in}} the Star Tribune noted that Plato's Closet in 2001 stocked up on brand names like Abercrombie & Fitch, Gap Inc., Silver Jeans Co., Sean John, Express, Inc., and Dr. Martens that they sold at a {{markdown}} of between 50% and 75%. Unlike consignment shops, Plato's Closet pays sellers on the spot. Used clothes are purchased at between 30% and 40% of what Plato's Closet intends to sell them at. According to a 2002 article in Winston-Salem Journal, Winmark spent around $67,000 for each television advertisement for Plato's Closet. In a 2009 interview with Star Tribune, CEO John <b>Morgan</b> <b>said</b> Plato's Closet did the best during the Great Recession among Winmark's franchises because people {{were more likely to}} sell used clothing to make money and to buy used clothing to save money.|$|E
25|$|In January 2011, Debbi <b>Morgan</b> <b>said</b> {{that she}} would take {{a leave of absence}} from the show. She said it was for {{personal}} reasons and on January 14, 2011, she released to the public that she has been diagnosed with Lyme Disease.

500|$|... "One of {{the most}} {{important}} things we were looking for in casting was the actors' ability to play the subtleties â€“ the little things that a character doesn't say or do that create the edge, the things that get under your skin and spook you," [...] <b>Morgan</b> <b>said</b> about the auditions.|$|E
500|$|Some of the {{dialogue}} Blair uses to describe {{his first meeting with}} ElizabethII led to accusations of plagiarism from Peter Morgan, who wrote The Queen, set during {{the first few months of}} Blair's premiership. Blair recalls his first meeting with ElizabethII in which she tells him, [...] "You are my 10th prime minister. The first was Winston. That was before you were born." [...] In the film, Helen Mirren's fictionalised ElizabethII says almost exactly the same thing. <b>Morgan</b> <b>said</b> it had been purely his own imagination.|$|E
500|$|After the WPS later {{suspended}} {{operations in}} early 2012 due to legal and financial difficulties, Morgan joined her national teammates Hope Solo, Sydney Leroux, Megan Rapinoe and Stephanie Cox on the Seattle Sounders Women for the 2012 season. Of her signing, <b>Morgan</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I am excited {{to play in}} a city that is so passionate about soccer. The Sounders have been one of, if not the best fan support in MLS. I can only imagine how Seattle fans would respond to having a full professional women's team in the future." ...|$|E

500|$|Writer Glen <b>Morgan</b> <b>said</b> of the episode, [...] "Duchovny {{challenged}} {{us to do}} a [...] "Beyond the Sea" [...] for him. The {{show had}} been so dark and bleak, and Jim and I {{feel that there is}} a side to the paranormal that's very hopeful. We wanted to do that side of it. I {{thought it would be a}} great opportunity for Duchovny, but then the situation came up with Gillian's pregnancy. We needed to get her off her feet anyway." [...] Consequently, Gillian Anderson, who had just given birth to her daughter Piper days before this episode spent the majority of the episode in a hospital bed.|$|E
500|$|Morgan met {{his first}} wife in Kent in the early 1980s. They married in 1982, but he left her when she became {{pregnant}} with twins. He met another woman after moving to Dorset. She also became pregnant, giving birth to a son, and they married in 1994, after living together for several years. Morgan {{had a reputation as}} a womaniser, seducing customers while working as an engineer. He continued this activity after becoming a lorry driver. Following Morgan's conviction, brother Ray <b>Morgan</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "He has had so many affairs over the years I have lost count." [...] He also had a violent temper. One friend, Dave Moemken, described him as being [...] "on a short fuse".|$|E
500|$|<b>Morgan</b> <b>said</b> {{his main}} {{hope for the}} film {{was that it would}} spark a debate on the topic and make people [...] "more mindful and choose things that support life and not take it away." [...] Morgan thought he had {{included}} a good number of counter-examples of how people can make a difference, so the film does not simply show [...] "the destructive ways this industry operates but also the opportunity to reinvent it" [...] through [...] "small choices [...] actually impact those [...]" [...] Ultimately, he considered his film an introduction to the topic that was able to connect several elements, any one of which would be worth being covered in a film.|$|E
5000|$|Food critic <b>Morgan</b> Murphy <b>said</b> [...] "The Black Label {{smells of}} deep vanilla and cherry {{and is a}} bit {{smoother}} than the green label." ...|$|R

500|$|In 2012, Morgan {{signed with}} Simon & Schuster to pen The Kicks, a four-book series for middle schoolers.

500|$|Morgan {{was born}} in the {{north-western}} New South Wales city of Tamworth, before growing up in Punchbowl, a suburb in South-western Sydney. Morgan was the oldest of four children, with two sisters and a brother. Her father Barrington, a plumber, had success as a swimmer in his childhood, but a lack of facilities in rural Australia curtailed his career. As a result, he vowed that his daughter would become a national champion. <b>Morgan</b> <b>said</b> her father [...] "became my driving and inspirational force. I not only fulfilled his ambition, but surpassed it by becoming an Olympic champion!" [...] Morgan also cited her meetings with Frederick Laneâ€”Australia's first Olympic gold medallist in swimmingâ€”and the Olympic athletics champion Marjorie Jackson-Nelson as key inspirational moments in her career.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{ultimate}} objectives behind {{the making of}} the film, <b>Morgan</b> <b>said</b> he was not trying to blame just a single company nor the fast fashion industry as [...] "it did not invent a very irresponsible way of manufacturing, it did not invent overmarketing the consumption of things." [...] The director said the film was intended to be a caution on the [...] "incessant consumption of mediocre stuff" [...] and an incentive to view shopping as something more than a hobby, adding that buying is [...] "a moral act and there is a chain reaction of consequences". He commented he was not trying to be [...] "anti-business or anti-market" [...] but was just reaffirming basic human rights and showing the limits of natural resources.|$|E
5000|$|Food critic <b>Morgan</b> Murphy <b>said</b> [...] "The {{sweet corn}} of this whiskey is {{hot on the}} lips but has a mild finish of vanilla and baking spices." ...|$|R
5000|$|Food critic <b>Morgan</b> Murphy <b>said</b> [...] "This amber beauty, {{with its}} notes of spice, rye, and cedar, packs a {{stronger}} bite than its sweet aroma would imply." ...|$|R
5000|$|Food critic <b>Morgan</b> Murphy <b>said</b> [...] "This {{very old}} brand of rye whiskey needles the drinker with zings of fruit flavors, grain bite, and sweet cereal notes." ...|$|R
500|$|Carter said of {{the casting}} of Nick Chinlund as Pfaster, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} wonderfully creepy villain. The casting of that show was very difficult. We saw many actors, but there was a quality I was looking for and I couldn't put a name on that quality. I finally figured out what it was when Nick came in and he had a kind of {{androgynous}} quality that worked. I thought he looked like Joe College, but he could scare the hell out of you." [...] Producer Glen <b>Morgan</b> <b>said</b> Chinlund's performance was outstanding. Nutter stated [...] "Nick Chinlund was wonderful to work with. The guy was like putty in my hands. He was great. If you're looking for someone to underline the weirdness and strangeness of the character, he did that." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode faced {{criticism}} from the crew over its ending using a deus ex machina {{to indicate that the}} Kindred may have been aliens. Producer James Wong felt that the episode's ending seemed overly abrupt and unexpected, describing it as appearing [...] "like we tried to play a trick on the audience to make them say 'Ooh, what the heck was that?. He added that the lack of a real connection to the episode's plot meant that the revelation lost any sense of catharsis for the viewer. <b>Morgan</b> <b>said</b> that the episode [...] "went too far. At what point do we become unbelievable?" [...] When asked about the similarity between the Kindred and the Amish, series creator Chris Carter noted that [...] "they [...] don't watch TV, so I wasn't worried about it".|$|E
500|$|The {{city was}} unable {{to raise money to}} build the museum, and the stones were damaged in five fires. The first came soon after the crates were set down in Golden Gate Park. <b>Morgan</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "piles of burning boxes were pulled over and down by the Fire Department, many hurled over a hundred and fifty feet." [...] Hearst died in 1951, and Morgan died in 1957; neither of them saw {{anything}} built with the stones. Two fires in 1959 appeared to be arson, and many of the fire-heated stones were weakened or cracked from sudden cooling by water. In 1960, Steilberg was hired to inspect the stones once again; he used a ball-peen hammer to lightly strike each stone and listen for a solid ringing tone, or a dull thud which indicated cracking. He found that a little more than half the stones were sound.|$|E
5000|$|Food critic <b>Morgan</b> Murphy <b>said</b> [...] "The dark amber of this bourbon {{makes it}} look like woodpile water, but the sweet caramel taste has a very {{restrained}} oak flavor." ...|$|R
