5|$|Sierra {{wanted the}} game to have Hollywood-quality film sequences, so they sought a {{director}} with experience in the film industry. They hired Peter <b>Maris,</b> whose previous experience was mainly of action and drama films, although some of his earlier films were graphic horror movies. <b>Maris</b> and Roberta Williams collaborated {{a great deal from}} the beginning of the process, with <b>Maris</b> explaining what he wanted in each scene from a filmmaker's perspective, and Williams explaining her desires from a game designer's perspective. <b>Maris</b> set up the camera angles and worked with the actors, using three motion-controlled cameras during the shooting. All filming was done entirely in front of a blue screen, and the digitized information was later loaded into the Silicon Graphics computers, which synchronized the relative motion of computer-generated, three-dimensional background art. Next, the live action and the backgrounds were composited using advanced techniques controlled by Petro VLahos's UltiMatte system. The computer imaging components made Phantasmagoria a very different experience for <b>Maris</b> than his usual film industry work. Crow served as a production coordinator during filming, helping facilitate what happened on stage. He also directed the scenes that involved stunts or other special effects that required the coordination of animated sequences with live action. Cindy Jordan worked as the makeup artist.|$|E
5|$|The 1961 season saw {{the chase}} of Babe Ruth's 1927 single season home run record by Roger <b>Maris</b> and Mickey Mantle. Both <b>Maris</b> and Mantle would {{continue}} to reach the home run record until Mantle got injured late in the season, leaving <b>Maris</b> to reach the record. On {{the last day of}} the season, <b>Maris</b> broke the record with his 61st home run of the year off Red Sox pitcher Tracy Stallard at Yankee Stadium. Former Hall of Fame shortstop for the Yankees, Phil Rizzuto, called the shot in what was one of his first games as an announcer. The Yankees won the game 1–0 to win their 26th American League pennant and then to win their 19th World Series title.|$|E
5|$|Adrienne Wilkinson as <b>Maris</b> Brood— A Zabrak {{survivor}} of the Jedi Purge and Shaak Ti's apprentice. The character was originally conceived to become a pirate captain, and Christianson's early art included Brood's lightsaber tonfas. Wilkinson brought strength to her performance, leading to {{an expansion of the}} role with more dialogue.|$|E

50|$|Several {{players had}} {{come close to}} {{breaking}} <b>Maris's</b> record {{in the years before}} 1998. Before the 1994 season was cut short by a labor dispute, Matt Williams of the San Francisco Giants and Ken Griffey, Jr. of the Seattle Mariners were both on a pace which threatened <b>Maris's</b> record: they hit 43 and 40 home runs respectively in a season which was shortened by approximately 50 of the scheduled 162 games.|$|R
50|$|The 1998 Major League Baseball {{home run}} chase in Major League Baseball was the race between first baseman Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals and right fielder Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs that {{resulted}} in both players breaking Roger <b>Maris's</b> long-standing and highly coveted record of 61 home runs. McGwire broke <b>Maris's</b> record on September 8 against the Cubs and finished with 70 home runs. Sosa finished with 66.|$|R

5|$|Imo {{was granted}} {{clearance}} to leave Bedford Basin by {{signals from the}} guard ship HMCS Acadia at approximately 7:30 {{on the morning of}} 6 December, with Pilot William Hayes on board. The ship entered the Narrows well above the harbour's speed limit in an attempt {{to make up for the}} delay experienced in loading her cargo. Imo met American tramp steamer SS Clara being piloted up the wrong (western) side of the harbour. The pilots agreed to pass starboard-to-starboard. Soon afterwards though, Imo was forced to head even further towards the Dartmouth shore after passing the tugboat Stella <b>Maris,</b> which was travelling up the harbour to Bedford Basin near mid-channel. Horatio Brannen, the captain of Stella <b>Maris,</b> saw Imo approaching at excessive speed and ordered his ship closer to the western shore to avoid an accident.|$|E
5|$|Ralph Houk {{was chosen}} to replace Stengel. During the 1961 season, both Mantle and <b>Maris</b> chased Ruth's single-season home run record of 60, and the pair {{attracted}} much press attention as the year progressed. Ultimately, an infection forced Mantle to leave the lineup and bow {{out of the race}} in mid-September with 54 home runs. <b>Maris</b> continued, though, and on October 1, {{the final day of the}} season, he homered against Red Sox pitcher Tracy Stallard into the right field stands of Yankee Stadium, breaking the record with 61. Commissioner Ford Frick decreed that two separate records be kept, as the Yankees played a 154-game schedule in 1927 (beginning in 1961, AL teams played 162 games to accommodate the league's expansion to 10 teams). MLB did away with the dual records 30 years later, giving <b>Maris</b> sole possession of the single-season home run record before it was broken in 1998 by Mark McGwire. The Yankees won the pennant with 109 regular season wins, at the time the club's second-highest single-season total, and defeated the Cincinnati Reds in five games to win the franchise's 19th World Series. The team hit 240 home runs to break the MLB single-season record. <b>Maris</b> won another AL MVP Award, while Whitey Ford captured the Cy Young Award, having posted a 25–4 record. The team gained a reputation as one of the strongest the Yankees had fielded, along with the 1927 and 1939 Yankees. New York returned to the World Series in 1962, facing the San Francisco Giants. After exchanging victories in the first six games of the Series, the Yankees won the decisive seventh game 1–0 to clinch the title.|$|E
25|$|He {{directed}} the made-for-television movie 61* (2001) based on Roger <b>Maris's</b> and Mickey Mantle's race to break Babe Ruth's single-season home run record in 1961. This earned Crystal an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special.|$|R
50|$|With two homers on the second-to-last day of {{the season}} and one more in the season finale. McGwire ended with 24 homers in the Cardinals uniform and 58 overall for the season. That was a single-season for a {{right-handed}} batter and fueled a winter of speculation that he might be the chosen one to break Roger <b>Maris's</b> hallowed record.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, {{only three}} years after McGwire and Sosa finally toppled <b>Maris's</b> record, the mark fell again, this time to San Francisco Giants left fielder Barry Bonds. Bonds broke the record on October 5 against Chan Ho Park of the Los Angeles Dodgers and, two days later, hit his 73rd home run of the season off the Dodgers pitcher Dennis Springer.|$|R
5|$|The Castrum <b>Maris</b> {{was built}} {{sometime}} in the Middle Ages. The castle definitely existed by the 13th century, and it {{was involved in the}} Battle of Malta of 1283. By the early 16th century, it belonged to the de Nava family.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{the forces}} of the Swedish Empire {{dominated}} Northern Germany, and along with her ally France, Sweden became guarantee power of the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. The Swedish aim of controlling the Baltic Sea by establishing dominions on the coastline ("dominium <b>maris</b> baltici") thwarted Frederick William's ambitions to gain control over the Oder estuary with Stettin (now Szczecin) in Pomerania.|$|E
50|$|The 1961 Chicago White Sox {{season was}} the team's 61st {{season in the}} major leagues, and its 62nd season overall. They {{finished}} with a record 86-76, good enough for fourth place in the American League, 23 games behind the first-place New York Yankees. Their pitching staff surrendered 13 of Roger <b>Maris's</b> 61 home runs that year, {{the most of any}} team.|$|R
50|$|Fisher {{was used}} {{primarily}} as a starting pitcher during his 11-year MLB career. He is known for giving up a few historic home runs. One was Ted Williams's 521st in his final major league at bat (September 28, 1960). Another was Roger <b>Maris's</b> 60th home run of the 1961 season (September 26, 1961). Also, he gave up the first home run in Shea Stadium history, to Willie Stargell (April 17, 1964).|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} known fortifications in Malta are defensive walls {{built around}} Bronze Age settlements. The Phoenicians, Romans and Byzantines built {{a number of}} defensive walls around important settlements, but very little remains of these survive today. By the late medieval period, the main fortifications on Malta were the capital Mdina, the Cittadella on Gozo, the Castrum <b>Maris</b> and a few coastal towers or lookout posts.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of the village on Via <b>Maris</b> enhanced the city's importance during the Ottoman rule. In 1596 CE, administrated by nahiya ("subdistrict") of Gaza under the liwa' ("district") of Gaza, the population of Ashdod numbered about 413. The villagers paid taxes on wheat, barley, sesame and fruit crops, as well as goats and beehives.|$|E
25|$|In the 1991 movie City Slickers {{starring}} Billy Crystal, Crystal's {{character is}} seen wearing a Mets hat. Crystal himself in reality {{is an avid}} and outspoken Yankee fan, {{so much that he}} had a personal friendship with his boyhood idol Mickey Mantle in as much he produced the movie 61* about Mantle and Roger <b>Maris's</b> chase for Babe Ruth's all-time record for home runs hit in a season. Crystal also celebrated his 60th birthday by signing a one-day contract with the Yankees in the 2008 Spring training.|$|R

25|$|In 1998, St. Louis Cardinals {{first baseman}} Mark McGwire and Chicago Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa {{engaged in a}} home run race for the ages. With both rapidly {{approaching}} Roger <b>Maris's</b> record of 61 home runs (set in 1961), seemingly the entire nation watched as the two power hitters raced {{to be the first}} to break the record. McGwire reached 62 first on September 8, 1998, with Sosa also eclipsing it later. Sosa finished with 66 home runs, just behind McGwire's unheard-of 70. However, recent steroid allegations have marred the season in the minds of many fans.|$|R
5|$|Directed by Peter <b>Maris,</b> {{the game}} {{features}} {{a cast of}} 25 actors, all performing {{in front of a}} blue screen. While most games at the time featured 80 to 100 backgrounds, Phantasmagoria includes more than 1,000. A professional Hollywood special effects house worked on the game, and the musical score includes a neo-Gregorian chant performed by a 135-voice choir. Sierra stressed it was intended for adult audiences. The company willingly submitted it to a ratings system, and included a password-protected censoring option within the game to tone down the graphic content.|$|E
5|$|In the 12th century {{religious}} hermits started inhabiting {{the caves}} on Mount Carmel, {{and in the}} 13th century they formed a new Catholic monastic order, the Carmelites.

In the 19th century, it was restored as a Carmelite monastery, the Stella <b>Maris</b> Monastery. The altar of the church as we see it today, stands over a cave associated with Prophet Elijah.|$|E
5|$|Several of Josquin's masses {{feature the}} {{paraphrase}} technique, and they {{include some of}} his most famous work including the great Missa Gaudeamus. The relatively early Missa Ave <b>maris</b> stella, which probably dates from his years in the Sistine Chapel choir, paraphrases the Marian antiphon of the same name; {{it is also one of}} his shortest masses. The late Missa de Beata Virgine paraphrases plainchants in praise of the Virgin Mary; it is a Lady Mass, a votive mass for Saturday performance, and was his most popular mass in the 16th century.|$|E
50|$|The 1994 San Francisco Giants {{season was}} the Giants' 112th season in Major League Baseball, their 37th season in San Francisco since their move from New York {{following}} the 1957 season, and their 35th at Candlestick Park. After winning 103 games in 1993, the Giants record dropped to 55-60 in a strike-shortened season. This {{was also the}} season in which Matt Williams hit a career high 43 home runs through 115 games {{by the time the}} strike hit, on pace to finish with 61; had the season continued, Williams may {{have had a chance to}} break Roger <b>Maris's</b> then-single season record of 61 home runs set in 1961.|$|R
5000|$|On September 21, 1998, Davidson {{controversially}} {{ruled that}} a ball hit by St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire in Milwaukee County Stadium was an automatic double instead of a home run. Davidson said that a fan reached over the outfield fence to catch the ball, interfering with a ball in play. The home run {{would have been the}} 66th of the season for McGwire, who had broken Roger <b>Maris's</b> single-season home run record earlier that month. McGwire and Cardinals president Bill DeWitt said after watching replays that they thought it should have been ruled a home run, and DeWitt attempted to appeal the ruling to Major League Baseball.|$|R
50|$|George Hendrik Breitner {{was born}} in Rotterdam, Netherlands. From 1876-1880 he {{attended}} the Art Academy in The Hague where his extraordinary talent was rewarded on various occasions. From October 1878 till April 1879 he worked as an art teacher at the Leiden academy Ars Aemula Naturae. In 1880 he was expelled from the Art Academy of The Hague for misconduct, because he had destroyed the regulations-board.

50|$|Initial {{development}} {{took place}} in Humphrey <b>Maris’s</b> group at Brown University {{and elsewhere in the}} late 1980s.In the early 1990s the method was extended in scope at Nippon Steel Corp. by direct sensing of the picosecond surface vibrations of the film caused by the returning strain pulses, resulting in improved detection sensitivity in many cases. Advances after the year 2000 include the generation of picosecond acoustic solitons by the use of millimeter propagation distances and the generation of picosecond shear waves by the use of anisotropic materials or small (~1 μm) optical spot sizes. Acoustic frequencies up to the terahertz range in solids and up to ~ 10 GHz in liquids have been reported.|$|R

500|$|Davis {{received}} a tweet on June 30 from Michael Tran in Michigan asking {{him if he}} had ever used steroids. He responded [...] "No", that same day. Davis said later in an interview, [...] "I have not ever taken any PEDs. I'm not sure fans realize, we have the strictest drug testing in all of sports, even more than the Olympics. If anybody {{was going to try to}} cheat in our game, they couldn't. It's impossible to try to beat the system. Anyway, I've never taken PEDs, no. I wouldn't. Half the stuff on the list I can't even pronounce." [...] Later, Davis would say that he believed Roger <b>Maris's</b> 61 home run season was the true single-season home run record, due to the steroid scandal surrounding Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, and Mark McGwire.|$|R
