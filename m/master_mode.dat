50|$|In a single-player game, {{the player}} takes control of Gojiro the samurai and {{utilizes}} {{various types of}} swords to defeat enemies. There are dozens of swords available in the game, which allow you to fight with five different sword styles. The basic maneuvers of each sword are similar, consisting of a quick combo, powerful charge move and aerial attack. However, each sword style offers unique abilities. In addition to the abilities given by each style, Gojiro also has the innate ability to dodge bullets, and even uses his sword to deflect them. By defeating enemies Gojiro can fill a meter which, when full, allows him to enter <b>Master</b> <b>Mode.</b> Once activated, <b>Master</b> <b>Mode</b> greatly increases Gojiro's abilities, allowing him to dispatch enemies in a single blow.|$|E

40|$|The substructuring {{technology}} possesses much merit {{when it is}} {{utilized in}} model updating or damage identification of large-scale structures. However, the conventional substructuring technologies require the complete eigensolutions of all substructures available to obtain the eigensolutions of the global structure, even if only a few eigensolutions of the global structure are needed. This paper proposes a modal truncation approximation in substructuring method, in which only the lowest eigensolutions of the substructures need to be calculated. Consequently, the computation efficiency is improved. The discarded higher eigensolutions are compensated by the residual flexibility. The division of substructures and the selection of <b>master</b> <b>modes</b> in each substructure are also studied. The proposed substructuring method is illustrated by a frame structure and a practical bridge. The two case studies verify that the proposed method can improve the original substructuring method significantly.

40|$|This {{is a work}} in {{two parts}} in which we show how to solve a large class of Lindblad master {{equations}} for non-interacting particles on L sites. In part I we concentrate on bosonic particles. We show how to reduce the problem to diagonalizing an L × L non-Hermitian matrix. In particular, for boundary dissipative driving of a uniform chain, the matrix is a tridiagonal bordered Toeplitz matrix which can be solved analytically for the normal <b>master</b> <b>modes</b> and their relaxation rates (rapidities). In the regimes in which an analytical solution cannot be found, our approach can still provide a speed-up in the numerical evaluation. We use this numerical method to study the relaxation gap at non-equilibrium phase transitions in a boundary driven bosonic ladder with synthetic gauge fields. We conclude by showing how to construct the non-equilibrium steady state. Comment: 10 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
5000|$|Game {{reviews for}} the North American PS2 game were mixed. IGN gave the PS2 version of Dance Dance Revolution X a 5.4/10 ("mediocre"), noting that Street <b>Master</b> <b>Mode</b> was neither [...] "good or bad", noting the {{dropping}} of online multiplayer {{and the previous}} mission mode and shop system from the previous version. The new announcer was also criticized, stating that it has the [...] "most annoying lines, voices, and attitude ever". The visuals were also criticized as being blocky, with the UI being described as [...] "ugly and unpolished". 1UP's Torrey Walker gave the game a C-, describing Street <b>Master</b> <b>Mode</b> as [...] "painfully dull and repetitive". The soundtrack was described as [...] "a clutter of uninspiring off-brand dance tracks, with captivating licensed songs few and far between" [...] (citing a poor stepchart for U Can't Touch This), and the announcer was dubbed [...] "unintentionally hysterical". However, {{the wide variety of}} game modes (including workout mode) was mentioned as a plus, and suggested the game as an alternative to Nintendo's Wii Fit.|$|E
5000|$|During the E3 gaming {{convention}} on July 15, 2008, additional information was revealed about the North American PlayStation 2 game, announcing that Dance Dance Revolution X would feature classic gameplay {{as well as}} new gameplay. The difficulty rating scale was extended resulting in existing songs in the series being re-rated to compensate. The Shock Arrow feature was also playable. Previously licensed music from earlier DDR series has returned including Me & My's [...] "Dub-I-Dub" [...] and Smile.dk's [...] "Butterfly". GameSpot's reporters announced that the game was expected to be released sometime during Fall 2008. Additionally, new gameplay screenshots were revealed at the same time showcasing new features like new and returning dancing characters, a new Workout Mode, LAN network gameplay and returning modes such as Battle, Edit, Training and Street <b>Master</b> <b>Mode.</b> A successor to the previous Master Modes, Street <b>Master</b> <b>Mode</b> is akin to Quest Mode from Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 3.
