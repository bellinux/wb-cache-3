5|$|A {{major theme}} {{of the game is}} heroism, where being a hero may bring more harm than help. During development, there was a point at the {{beginning}} of the game where players could choose to leave Dubai. This was cut from the game, as the team found it not effective enough, and it broke a player's immersion in the game. According to Williams, the choice system was originally designed to be similar to Fable II, where after a player makes a decision, they cannot reload the game and choose differently unless they start a new game. This was later removed due to the game's structure as a shooter, as the team feared that it <b>might</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> game unwinnable and cause players to feel frustrated. Williams later added that adding achievements to the game was a mistake, as it disrupts the game's narrative.|$|E

25|$|A {{shift in}} {{preferences}} at the microeconomic level, {{caused by an}} income effect can change the make-up of {{the consumer price index}} to include proportionately more expenditure on services. This alone may shift the consumer price index, and <b>might</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> non-trade sector look relatively less productive than it had been when demand was lower; if service quality (rather than quantity) follows diminishing returns to labour input, a general demand for a higher service quality automatically produces a reduction in per-capita productivity.|$|E
25|$|The baking of matzo is labor-intensive, as only 18–22 {{minutes is}} {{permitted}} between {{the mixing of}} flour and water to the conclusion of baking and removal from the oven. Consequently, {{only a small number}} of matzos can be baked at one time, and the chabura members are enjoined to work the dough constantly so that it is not allowed to ferment and rise. A special cutting tool is run over the dough just before baking to prick any bubbles which <b>might</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> matza puff up; this creates the familiar dotted holes in the matzo.|$|E

25|$|Issues {{surrounding}} {{global trade}} regulations and LDCs have gained {{a lot of}} media and policy attention thanks to the recently collapsed Doha Round of World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations being termed a development round. During the WTO's Hong Kong Ministerial, it was agreed that LDCs could see 100 percent duty-free, quota-free access to U.S. markets if the round were completed. But analysis of the deal by NGOs found that the text of the proposed LDC deal had substantial loopholes that <b>might</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> offer less than the full 100 percent access, and could even erase some current duty-free access of LDCs to rich country markets. Dissatisfaction with these loopholes led some economists to call for a reworking of the Hong Kong deal.|$|E

Byrnes, who a {{year earlier}} had told {{physicist}} Leo Szilard that a public demonstration of the bomb <b>might</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union [...] "more manageable" [...] in Europe, now argued the opposite: that further display of U.S. nuclear power could harden the Soviet Union's position against acceptance of the Acheson–Lilienthal Plan, which discussed possible methods for the international control {{of nuclear weapons and}} the avoidance of future nuclear warfare. At a March 22 cabinet meeting he said, [...] "from the standpoint of international relations it would be very helpful if the test could be postponed or never held at all." [...] He prevailed on Truman to postpone the first test for six weeks, from May 15 to July 1. For public consumption, the postponement was explained as an opportunity for more Congressional observers to attend during their summer recess.|$|E
500|$|In July 1932, Patton was {{executive}} officer of the 3rd Cavalry, which was ordered to Washington by Army Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur. Patton took command of the 600 troops of the 3rd Cavalry, and on July 28, MacArthur ordered Patton's troops to advance on protesting veterans known as the [...] "Bonus Army" [...] with tear gas and bayonets. Patton was dissatisfied with MacArthur's conduct, as he recognized the legitimacy of the veterans' complaints and had himself earlier refused to issue the order to employ armed force to disperse the veterans. Patton later stated that, though he found the duty [...] "most distasteful", he also felt that putting the marchers down prevented an insurrection and saved lives and property. He personally led the 3rd Cavalry down Pennsylvania Avenue, dispersing the protesters. Patton also encountered his former orderly as one of the marchers and forcibly ordered him away, fearing such a meeting <b>might</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> headlines.|$|E
500|$|The Astonishing has {{received}} generally favorable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album holds an average score of 80, based on six reviews. Critics were especially complimentary of the band's willingness {{to write a}} long, unconventional album, with AllMusic commenting, [...] "Dream Theater have invested in the 'album' concept (and in listeners' attention spans) even as the music biz doubles down {{on the notion that}} long-players are merely envelopes to hold singles." [...] Rolling Stone echoed these sentiments, concluding, [...] "The results won't please every Dream Theater partisan, nor will they convert the skeptical. But it would take a hard heart to deny Petrucci, co-composer and keyboardist Jordan Rudess and their mates credit for the boldness of their aspirations and the assurance with which they achieve them." [...] Loudwire was also supportive of the band's unique approach, but warned that it <b>might</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> album polarizing for fans.|$|E

500|$|In 1982 El Salvador took a 20-man squad (two players {{short of}} the normal 22, as a {{controversial}} cost–saving measure), coached by the aforementioned Mauricio [...] "Pipo" [...] Rodríguez, to Spain. The team's experience was an unhappy one. In their first match on June 15 in Elche, they were defeated 10–1 by Hungary, a scoreline that stands as a World Cup record to this day. A silver lining was that Luis Baltazar Ramírez Zapata scored the country's first World Cup goal during the game, albeit at a point when the Salvadorans were already down 5–0. It was cold comfort however. When Zapata scored against Hungary, some Salvadorans cried out to Zapata not to celebrate the goal effusively because it <b>might</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> Hungarians angry {{and encourage them to}} score more. El Salvador managed to regain some pride in their subsequent games. Displaying much-improved levels of organisation and commitment, they lost 1–0 to Belgium on June 19 in Elche and 2–0 to the then-reigning world champions, Argentina, in Alicante on June 23.|$|E
500|$|Rhodes began {{advocating the}} {{annexation}} by Britain of Matabeleland and Mashonaland in 1887 by applying pressure {{to a number}} of senior colonial officials, most prominently the High Commissioner for Southern Africa, Sir Hercules Robinson, and Sidney Shippard, Britain's administrator in the Bechuanaland Crown colony (comprising that country's southern part). Shippard, an old friend of Rhodes, was soon won over to the idea, and in May 1887 the administrator wrote to Robinson strongly endorsing annexation of the territories, particularly Mashonaland, which he described as [...] "beyond comparison the most valuable country south of the Zambezi". It was the Boers, however, who were first to achieve diplomatic successes with Lobengula. Pieter Grobler secured a treaty of [...] "renewal of friendship" [...] between Matabeleland and the South African Republic in July 1887. The same month, Robinson organised the appointment of John Smith Moffat, a locally born missionary, as assistant commissioner in Bechuanaland. Moffat, well-known to Lobengula, was given this position in the hope that he <b>might</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> king less cordial with the Boers and more pro-British.|$|E

[...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote: [...] "Though her Cowgirl image is easily her least significant incarnation to date, Drowned World proves that Madonna is still unmatched in her ability to lift cultural iconography into the mainstream. [...] Those who thought Madonna hung up her handcuffs along with the notorious Sex book should look again closely. With its themes of chaos, dominance, and, ultimately, celebration, Madonna's Drowned World explores her ever-fervid intrigue with both imposed and pious restraint." ...|$|E
