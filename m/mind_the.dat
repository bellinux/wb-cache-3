5|$|After his {{accession}} {{to the throne}} in 1820, King GeorgeIV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace {{with the help of}} his architect John Nash. The external façade was designed keeping in <b>mind</b> <b>the</b> French neo-classical influence preferred by GeorgeIV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of GeorgeIV in 1830, his younger brother King WilliamIV hired Edward Blore to finish the work. After the destruction of the Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834, William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament.|$|E

As Bounty sailed slowly towards Tubuai, Bligh's launch, overcoming many dangers and hardships, made its way steadily towards civilisation and reached Coupang (now Kupang), on Timor, on 14 June 1789. Here Bligh gave his first report of the mutiny, while awaiting a ship to take him back to England.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{starts with}} some criticisms of {{so-called}} standard realism. This view is characterized, according to Fodor, by two distinct assertions. One of these regards the internal structure of mental states and asserts that such states are non-relational. The other concerns the semantic theory of mental content and asserts {{that there is}} an isomorphism between the causal roles of such contents and the inferential web of beliefs. Among modern philosophers of <b>mind,</b> <b>the</b> majority view seems to be that the first of these two assertions is false, but that the second is true. Fodor departs from this view in accepting the truth of the first thesis but rejecting strongly the truth of the second.|$|E

50|$|In one sense, all terma may be {{considered}} mind-termas, since the teaching associated is always inserted in the essence of <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> of <b>the</b> practitioner; in other words the terma is always a direct transmission from the essence of <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> of <b>the</b> vidyadhara towards the essence of <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> of <b>the</b> tertön.
