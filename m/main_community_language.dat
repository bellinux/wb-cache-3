40|$|The <b>Community</b> <b>Languages</b> in Higher Education report, {{funded by}} 'Routes Into Languages', mapped {{provision}} and investigated {{the needs and}} aspirations of <b>community</b> <b>language</b> learners in higher education in England using a multi-methodological approach. The main findings suggested that though there is currently provision for 81 languages, most of this is organised for foreign <b>language</b> learners, and <b>community</b> <b>language</b> learners are often discouraged or barred from joining courses {{on the basis that}} provision is not suitable for them. There are no degree courses in the <b>main</b> <b>community</b> <b>languages</b> in use in England, though there are some professional and post-graduate courses which require advanced levels of competence in some <b>community</b> <b>languages.</b> These findings are critically discussed with specific recommendations in terms of (i) meeting needs and aspirations of stakeholders; (ii) teaching and learning needs and challenges; (iii) professional education provision; and (iv) policies and strategies concerning languages in higher education. We propose a broader vision of languages encompassing the interests of <b>community</b> and foreign <b>language</b> learners amongst national policy-making bodies, decision-makers and communities, and breaking down artificial distinctions between the two areas, thus benefiting all learners. Our recommendations also involve improving provision and initiating awareness raising activities about benefits accruing from investment in <b>community</b> <b>languages...</b>|$|R
40|$|Language {{barriers}} {{present a}} major obstacle to minority ethnic communities accessing primary healthcare. Whereas it is recognised that interpreting services are generally inadequate and inappropriate reliance is placed on family members to interpret, {{little is known about}} how nurses working in primary care utilise interpreters to overcome language barriers. The present paper reports on a study examining the utilisation of interpreting services by a range of primary care nurses from the perspectives of the nurses, interpreters and minority ethnic communities. Focus groups were undertaken with five separate groups of district nurses, health visitors, practice nurses, community midwives and specialist nurses, three groups of interpreters from different interpreting services, and five groups of participants from the <b>main</b> <b>community</b> <b>languages</b> in the locality where the study was undertaken (i. e. Arabic, Bengali, Cantonese, Somali and Urdu). Focus group discussions were tape-recorded and subsequently transcribed. Data analysis drew upon the principles of 'framework' analysis. The use of interpreters by primary care nurses varied considerably. Nurses who had received training in using interpreters and who had most control over the timing of patient visits were more likely to use interpreting services. Inadequate training of both nurses and interpreters adversely affected the quality of interaction where interpreters were used. Primary care nurses acted as gatekeepers to interpreting services. Whereas interpreting services were generally perceived to be inadequate, many nurses were accepting of the status quo and prepared to rely on family members to interpret rather than champion the need to improve services. </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{tensions}} between the communities of Belgium arose around a struggle between the two <b>main</b> <b>language</b> <b>communities</b> of the country, Dutch and French. This resulted in extensive language legislation, but which did not solve the conflicts between Flanders and Wallonia, the two main regions of the country. Due to the then widespread discrimination against Flemings, symbolized by the bad treatment of Flemish soldiers during World War I, the Flemish organized themselves against the mostly French-speaking government.

As a consequence of socialist colonization during the Soviet regime a quarter of Estonian population today is Russian-speaking. The two <b>main</b> <b>language</b> <b>communities</b> have different informational spaces separated by a language barrier. Integration can only be successful if there is unhampered communication between minority and majority groups, and equal opportunities for individuals and groups to participate in the public sphere. First, we discuss the concept of minority language media and the position of Russian-language media in the context of societal integration in Estonia. Using a quantitative survey we depict the current professional status of Estonian Russian-speaking journalists, and display their perceptions about their role in integration. We conclude that Russian-speaking journalists perceive themselves as mediators between Estonian and Russian communities, but are not positive about the possibilities of Russian-language media to fulfil their task as representatives of the minority...|$|R

40|$|This article {{takes the}} TV-hoax ‘Bye bye Belgium’ as a {{starting}} point to deal with the special linguistic and cultural sensitivities in bilingual Belgium. In the intricate bi- or multilingual context of Belgian politics, ideologically inspired topics are {{not just a matter of}} political conviction. They are also very much a matter of linguistic affiliation and of the way the topics are presented and translated for the audience. Developments in Belgian politics over the last decades have been characterised by the existence of large-scale political agreements and compromises between the members of the two <b>main</b> <b>language</b> <b>communities.</b> These agreements seem to be the only way to solve nationalistically based differences of opinion and to bridge the cultural and political gap between the two communities. Sometimes, compromises can only be reached through an extremely well-balanced formulation containing varying points of emphasis in each language. Thus, the framework of the discussion is very different in the northern and the southern parts of the country, as the TV-programme illustrates. Modern media coverage stimulates the use of conflict frames and as such works counterproductive to the fragile political compromise model in Belgium. status: publishe...|$|R
