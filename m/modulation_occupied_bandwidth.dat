The signals considered here employ either a squarewave of sinewave subcarrier.

30|$|The same {{analysis}} {{has been carried}} out taking into account the <b>bandwidth</b> <b>occupied</b> by the nodes instead of the received power. In this case, the results are not good enough. The reason for the poor results is the behavior of the secondary users. As we have explained before, the secondary nodes only send packets when the channel is free, so the <b>occupied</b> <b>bandwidth</b> has a greater variance than that obtained in the power detection-based scenarios. The PUE attack has been impossible to detect with good precision using the <b>occupied</b> <b>bandwidth.</b> This only means that the presented algorithm does not work with our definition of the SUs.|$|R

50|$|In addition, after {{separation}} {{of data and}} metadata, data and metadata can be processed independently in different hosts without <b>occupying</b> <b>bandwidth</b> of data channel, which can improve the concurrency of data and metadata to further enhance file system performance.|$|R
50|$|Intermodulation is also rarely {{desirable}} in radio, as {{it creates}} unwanted spurious emissions, {{often in the}} form of sidebands. For radio transmissions this increases the <b>occupied</b> <b>bandwidth,</b> leading to adjacent channel interference, which can reduce audio clarity or increase spectrum usage.|$|R
50|$|Signals {{that are}} below {{the noise floor}} can be {{detected}} by using different techniques of spread spectrum communications, where signal of a particular information bandwidth is deliberately spread in the frequency domain resulting in a signal with a wider <b>occupied</b> <b>bandwidth.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{general theory}} for non-baseband and {{nonuniform}} samples {{was developed in}} 1967 by Henry Landau.

30|$|In {{order to}} infer {{influence}} of intentional interference on the communication, a vector signal generator {{is used as}} a jammer emulator.

30|$|The FBMC {{waveform}} {{does not}} require any external transmit filter to meet the spectral constraints imposed on the adjacent channel spectrum leakage, while as already underlined earlier CP-OFDM requires a transmit lowpass filter of around 52 taps applied on both real and imaginary parts of the signal assuming an <b>occupied</b> <b>bandwidth</b> of 7.2 MHz.|$|R

Mach Zehnder Modulator (MZM) was utilized as the optical modulator. The simulations {{were carried out}} using Optisystem software. The simulation results prove that the PSD of DCO WOFDM signal is more compatible with the channel frequency response compared to the PSD of DCO OFDM signal. This consequently results in considerable improvement in BER performance of DCO WOFDM system compared to the BER performance of DCO OFDM system as well as slight improvement in OSNR performance of DCO WOFDM signal {{in comparison with the}} OSNR performance of DCO OFDM signal.

40|$|Recent {{experimental}} {{advances have}} allowed electronic band structures {{to be investigated}} by angle resolved photoemission in considerably more detail. A recent study of ferromagnetic iron finds the <b>occupied</b> <b>bandwidth,</b> for the two shallow bands observed, reduced by similar to 30 {{as compared to the}} calculated ground state, rendering bcc iron comparable with the strongly correlated transition metal Ni. Fermi velocities were reported to deviate from the ground state and these deviations have been assigned entirely to electron correlation. We show that spin orbit splitting, final state transitions and final state broadening significantly change the band dispersion as measured by a modern energy analyzer, and a simple model that accounts for their effects is introduced. Applying our model, we find for the <b>occupied</b> <b>bandwidth</b> a narrowing of the order of only 10 in agreement with the literature. Substantial renormalization of the Fermi velocities is confirmed but a significantly smaller fraction of it is attributed to correlation effects, namely many electron interaction...|$|R

30|$|To recap, the Radon-like CS data {{gathering}} procedure lets the fusion center collect all the needed measurements {{in a highly}} parallelized fashion. Far from being optimal, the {{data gathering}} scheme introduced herein allows {{a significant reduction in}} both the <b>occupied</b> <b>bandwidth</b> and the consumed energy w.r.t. state-of-the-art data gathering scheme such as the RS introduced in [10]. Further developments of globally optimized Radon-like CS data gathering algorithms are still under investigation.|$|R
30|$|The energy/bandwidth pairs draw {{different}} trajectories {{while the}} number of nodes N increases. We clearly recognize a systematic energy and bandwidth saving of the RL scheme w.r.t. the competitors. Moreover, both the consumed energy and the <b>occupied</b> <b>bandwidth</b> exhibit far smaller variations with the number of network nodes than what happens with the RD and RR schemes, making the RL approach fully scalable in terms of network nodes.|$|R
30|$|As FBMC {{does not}} require any {{transmit}} filter, as its in-built filter matches adjacent channel requirement; its complexity does not change with the <b>occupied</b> <b>bandwidth.</b> For CP-OFDM, complexities of modulation and demodulation are heavily dependent {{on the length of}} the transmit filter. Values in Table 4 do not take complexity of the equalizer into account. When considered, complexity figures are mitigated, and CP-OFDM and FBMC are expected to be comparable.|$|R
