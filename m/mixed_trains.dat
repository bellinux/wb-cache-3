5|$|The {{timetable}} for January 1883 shows {{a variety of}} passenger, goods and <b>mixed</b> <b>trains,</b> giving five passenger services down to Amlwch, and six up. The first train of the morning, departing Bangor at 04:20, and the 19:35 from Amlwch also carried mail {{to and from the}} island. The majority of trains still terminated at Gaerwen. As Llangefni held a livestock market on a Thursday, an extra service from Bangor to Llangefni on Thursdays was introduced by the 1896 timetable.|$|E
25|$|In 1930 a Royal Commission on New Zealand's {{railways}} suggested all {{passenger services}} {{on the southern}} and northern sections be replaced by <b>mixed</b> <b>trains,</b> {{but this was not}} positively received by the public. However, on 29 January 1939 the passenger services on the Waiau line were cancelled.|$|E

In this paper, {{we study}} {{mechanical}} automation with analysis of <b>mixed</b> <b>train</b> scheduling {{problem on the}} high-speed rail line and present a new simulation approach for solving the <b>mixed</b> <b>train</b> scheduling problem on a high-speed double-track rail line. Based on the discrete-time movement model, we propose control strategies for <b>mixed</b> <b>train</b> movement on a high-speed double-track rail line. Using our proposed method, we can effectively simulate the <b>mixed</b> <b>train</b> schedule on a rail line. The numerical results demonstrate that a proper decrease of the departure intervals can enhance the capacity...|$|R

25|$|Before the Wairarapa Connection, 88 seater railcars {{were used}} between Masterton and Wellington. They had {{replaced}} the steam-hauled <b>mixed</b> <b>trains</b> and Wairarapa class railcars in 1955, when the Rimutaka Tunnel opened and the line became the first fully dieselised line in New Zealand. The Wairarapa Mail carriage train ran between Wellington and Woodville until 1948.|$|E
25|$|Scrapping of DD class {{locomotives}} commenced {{as early}} as 1929, with newer K and N class locomotives taking over branch line goods services and Petrol Electric Rail Motors (and later Diesel Electric Rail Motors) starting to replace <b>mixed</b> <b>trains</b> and locomotive-hauled branch line passenger services. The unrebuilt saturated steam D1 class locomotives {{were the first to}} go, and by 1951 no fewer than 120 had been scrapped.|$|E
25|$|Traffic on {{the line}} was never heavy until the 1960s; for many years, two <b>mixed</b> <b>trains</b> ran a week from Lumsden. These trains carried both {{passengers}} and goods, with the usual inbound cargo consisting of agricultural lime and fertiliser, and wool and livestock outbound. Passengers were no longer carried after 4 October 1937, and the low freight figures implied that the line was set for a slow descent into oblivion.|$|E

25|$|In November 1956, the Northland Express {{carriage}} {{train was}} replaced by a railcar service utilising 88 seaters. These popular services barely lasted longer than a decade, being withdrawn in July 1967 as the railcars proved mechanically unreliable. The Auckland Harbour Bridge had opened in 1959 and drastically cut road transport times north, and in the face of heightened competition, the railway could not compete and no dedicated passenger service replaced the railcars. Passenger carriages were now attached to some freight trains to create mixed services that ran between Whangarei and Auckland and from Whangarei to Okaihau and Opua; as they adhered to the freight schedules, the <b>mixed</b> <b>trains</b> ran much slower than the previous dedicated passenger services. This slow pace made them unpopular and the last <b>mixed</b> <b>trains</b> ran in 1976. Since this time, no passenger trains have run beyond the northern extremity of Auckland's suburban network with the exception of excursion trains a few times per year and a brief trial in 2008-09 as far as Helensville.|$|E
25|$|For {{a number}} of decades before the {{connection}} of {{the northern and southern}} ends, the Canterbury section was operated with its terminus in Culverden, even when the coastal route reached Parnassus. The most important passenger train was the Culverden Express, with carriages for Parnassus detached at Waipara. The express was supplemented by slower <b>mixed</b> <b>trains.</b> When the Waiau Branch reached Waiau in 1919 one goods train per day between Christchurch and Culverden was added to the schedule and the passenger train operated twice daily; these services continued to Waiau thrice weekly. The section of the Main North Line between Christchurch and Rangiora also saw commuter services and trains from the Oxford Branch and Eyreton Branch.|$|E
25|$|In Southland, the Model T Ford railcars were {{assigned}} to the Waikaia and the Wyndham (Glenham) branches and began operating in late May 1926. These two lines were similar in some ways to the Greytown Branch; although they did not have multiple shuttle services to connect with mainline trains, they served small towns with insufficient demand for locomotive-hauled carriage passenger trains. Previously, the two lines had been served by <b>mixed</b> <b>trains</b> that carried both passengers and freight, and as they had to load and unload freight along the way, trip times were slow and thus unpopular. It was hoped the Model T Ford railcars would rejuvenate traffic and provide some measure of profitability, especially on the section of the Wyndham Branch from Wyndham to Glenham, which was so underutilised that it was facing closure.|$|E

25|$|The line to Hayling Island {{remained}} profitable, however, {{primarily due to}} {{the heavy}} traffic in summer. The condition of the bridge over Langstone Harbour was, however, deteriorating, and the Southern Region designated the bridge as being beyond economic repair. The final scheduled services over the line were run on 3 November 1963, and a special 'topped and tailed' by 32636 and 32670 the following day. The final scheduled train was notable for {{being one of the}} last steam hauled <b>mixed</b> <b>trains.</b> With the closure of this line, BR decided to withdraw the last remaining members of the class from traffic. At the time of her withdrawal following the closure of the line, No.32636 (formerly 72 Fenchurch) was the oldest working steam engine in British Railways ownership. The final operational A1X with BR was No.32678, which remained in service from Brighton shed until 10 August 1963.|$|E
25|$|When {{the full}} line opened in 1897, {{passenger}} services from the Hutt Valley to Wellington were augmented by NZR's first express from Wellington, the Napier Express (the WMR had operated the Wellington-Longburn {{portion of the}} New Plymouth Express). After the acquisition of the WMR, the Napier Express was re-routed to the quicker west coast route in early 1909 and the Wairarapa Mail was introduced to provide a regular service through the Wairarapa to Woodville. In 1936, RM class Wairarapa railcars were introduced; these were designed to operate at speed over the Rimutaka Incline and provided a much quicker service to Wellington and local Wairarapa services. They originally augmented the Wairarapa Mail but replaced it in 1948. Carriage trains operated only at peak {{times of the year}} when the railcar capacity was exceeded; in 1955, the Incline's closure meant the Wairarapa railcars were withdrawn and 88 seater railcars were introduced, boosting capacity at off-peak times. One Wairarapa railcar has survived and is currently under restoration by the Pahiatua Railcar Society. <b>Mixed</b> <b>trains</b> also operated until the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Before the Main North Line was completed, {{the open}} {{sections}} were served by <b>mixed</b> <b>trains</b> and the Culverden Express. On 15 December 1945 {{the line was}} completed and the Picton Express began operating, providing a daily service between Picton and Christchurch. In January 1946 the express was cut to thrice weekly, and its popularity and profitability declined. In February 1956 it {{was replaced by a}} more frequent railcar service, using RM class 88-seaters. Falling patronage led to smaller Vulcan railcars being used from 1968 to 1975 with small trains, in summer, sometimes known as the Picton Express. In 1976 at the suggestion of Rangiora MP Derek Quigley, the old former first class cars previously used on the overnight Picton–Christchurch 'Cabbage Train' were transferred to the day express to provide train heating, and several other 56ft carriages were fitted with heaters to make an economical train. Progressively the old carriages were updated and a buffet carriage was eventually added to replace the Kaikoura pie and tea stop, at the last traditional NZR-style refreshment stop.|$|E

500|$|Jones {{increased}} scheduled passenger journeys {{from two}} to three each day in each direction. With locomotives generally occupied with goods, many passenger services were drawn by horse. While the increased passenger journeys boosted revenues, the Tramway no longer owned enough horses and had to hire them. By 1881 the passenger service was losing £11(about £ in [...] ) a month, although reduced use of locomotives lowered maintenance costs. Although reliability had improved, services were still slow. Horse-drawn passenger services took 60–70 minutes to travel [...] between Quainton Road and Brill. The locomotive-hauled <b>mixed</b> <b>trains,</b> with frequent stops to load and unload, were timetabled at 1 to 2 hours {{to make the same}} journey, slower than walking.|$|E
500|$|Residents of {{the nearby}} town of Brill lobbied the Duke for the {{introduction}} of passenger services on the line. This led to an upgrading and extension of the line from Wotton, via the original terminus of the tramway system at Wood Siding, to a new terminus at the foot of Brill Hill, north of the hilltop town of Brill itself. The new Brill railway station opened in March 1872. In addition to freight trains which ran as and when required, two <b>mixed</b> <b>trains</b> per day ran in each direction. The Duke bought two Aveling and Porter traction engines modified to work as locomotives, each with a top speed of , although a speed limit of [...] was enforced. With the extension to Brill opened, the line began to be referred to as the Brill Tramway.|$|E
