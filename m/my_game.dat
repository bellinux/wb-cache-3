500|$|The nightly in-character guest {{interviews}} were initially {{of concern to}} Colbert, who worried his character's belligerent nature would be off-putting to guests. However, since the show's debut, {{he says he has}} found he is able to [...] "slide the intensity" [...] of his behavior depending on his interviewee's ability to respond to his aggressive approach. Colbert now often cites the interview segment as his favorite part of the show, because it allows him to improvise. Colbert advises his guests to disabuse the character of his ignorance. [...] "Don't let me get away with anything. Don't try to play <b>my</b> <b>game.</b> Be real. Be passionate. Hold your ideas. Give me resistance. Give me traction I can work against." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} 2004, Hunt {{signed a}} {{contract}} with the Broncos for an additional two years, with the intention of staying at the club {{for the rest of his}} career. On re-signing, Hunt stated, [...] "I look around and see guys like Webbie and Locky who have been here for their entire careers, and it's something I would like to do. If I can, I want to be a one-club player too. Playing footy is not just about 80 minutes out on the field every week. For me it is a career and I want to be happy where I am, satisfied that <b>my</b> <b>game</b> is progressing and that I am learning all the time to be a better player." ...|$|E

500|$|Munnerlyn {{was drafted}} by the Carolina Panthers in the seventh round (216th overall) of the 2009 NFL Draft. Munnerlyn called being drafted by the Panthers, [...] "{{exciting}}, because I played college ball at South Carolina, and that's only like an hour away. It was exciting to hear my name get called. I'm ready for it, ready to take <b>my</b> <b>game</b> to the next level." [...] Munnerlyn holds the Panthers career interception return touchdown record with 5 touchdowns and is tied for the club's single-season record with 2, a feat he achieved in both 2012 and 2013 seasons, the only Panthers player to have multiple [...] interception return scores in a season twice. The 5 interception touchdowns ranked second in the NFL from 2010-2014.|$|E
500|$|Robertson {{is the son}} of Mazell and Bailey Robertson. He has two brothers, Bailey Jr. and Henry. He {{remembers a}} tough childhood, plagued by poverty and racism. When a {{biography}} was going to be written about him in the 1990s, Robertson joked that his life had been [...] "dull", and that he had been [...] "married to the same woman for a long time". In 1997, Robertson donated one of his kidneys to his daughter Tia, who suffered lupus-related kidney failure. [...] He has been an honorary spokesman for the National Kidney Foundation ever since. In 2003, he published his own autobiography, The Big O: My Life, My Times, <b>My</b> <b>Game.</b> Robertson also owns the chemical company Orchem, based in Cincinnati, Ohio.|$|E
500|$|Brodie plays as a striker and was {{described}} by the Times & Star as a [...] "prolific" [...] goalscorer. After making his debut for York in February 2007, Dave Flett of The Press said Brodie [...] "looks a potent package of pace and power with a competitive streak that should strike fear into countless Conference defenders". Foyle's guidance while manager at York was credited as benefiting Brodie. He stated [...] "I've worked hard trying to improve <b>my</b> <b>game</b> and I'm starting to score different types of goals" [...] in December 2009. He {{was described}} by the Huddersfield Daily Examiner as [...] "one of non-league football's hottest properties" [...] in January 2010. After signing for Crawley in August 2010, manager Evans said [...] "The lad is a terrific player, he works very hard for the team and gets a goal".|$|E
5000|$|In many ways, I'll {{agree with}} it. That's {{another way of}} saying, [...] "Crawford's games aren't that much fun." [...] And there is some merit in that. I don't strive so much for simple-minded fun ... {{do you want a}} game that will punch you in the stomach or really affect you? ... None of <b>my</b> <b>games</b> are great, none of <b>my</b> <b>games</b> have touched people deeply, but that is what I am {{learning}} how to do ... none of <b>my</b> <b>games</b> can hold a candle to any of Charlie Chaplin's works. I don't even think I've reached D. W. Griffith's level yet. I hope that someday I will ... If I didn't think that possible, I would get out of the business.|$|R

500|$|The 2003–04 season {{had been}} capped by {{victory in the}} Pura Cup {{following}} a 321 victory over Queensland in the final, in which White made a half-century and claimed five of the oppositions wickets. [...] Victoria captain Berry retired from professional cricket after the triumph, and White was named as his replacement for 2004–05. [...] White {{was pleased with the}} appointment, saying that the captaincy [...] "brings out the best in <b>my</b> <b>game</b> and the extra responsibility is good for me". In December 2004, White made his maiden first-class century, making 119 after Victoria were forced to follow-on against Queensland. [...] His partnership of 205 with Ian Harvey, a record seventh-wicket partnership for Victoria, and 152 from opener Jason Arnberger helped Victoria recover to a second-innings total of 508/8 declared. [...] A fine bowling performance then saw Queensland bowled out for just 169, capping a [...] "remarkable fightback" [...] by Victoria.|$|E
500|$|If one is {{interested}} in making something {{for the public to}} view—be it a painting, a book, an album, a film, or a video game, should the POSSIBLE harm that may come out of this work be grounds for its suppression from society? This is, in a sense, pre-crime. If you believe in what you're doing and you want to express yourself, the expression should be primary and any interpretations that come after must always remain of secondary importance {{to the creation of the}} work itself. On another level, the entire correlation between the Dawson College shooting and <b>my</b> <b>game</b> is unfounded. [...] What else did Kimveer like? Black clothes? Goth music? Pizza? [...] If anything, the Dawson College shooting is proof positive that games like [...] should be made; until video games are no longer among the [...] "usual suspects" [...] for homicidal rampages, the public needs to more carefully consider why interactive electronic media is somehow the manufacturer of Manchurian Candidates.|$|E
500|$|Although {{he was a}} striker, Dickov {{was better}} known for his {{tenacity}} than his goal-scoring exploits. In a 2003 interview with the Independent on Sunday he provided a summary of his playing style: [...] "The ability to battle {{is one of the}} main parts of <b>my</b> <b>game.</b> I know my limits. I am not the sort who gets the ball and is then going to beat five or six players and stick it in the top corner from God knows where. But, whether I'm playing well or not, the one thing you will get from me is 110 per cent, upsetting defenders and basically giving them pain." [...] Rio Ferdinand was mentioning his name as the biggest headache to deal with on the pitch. His combative approach resulted in Manchester City manager Joe Royle naming him [...] "The Wasp", and during his time at Leicester he was known as [...] "The Pest".|$|E

500|$|After redshirting his {{freshman}} year in 1980–81 {{because he could not}} yet get clearance from the NCAA to play, Olajuwon played sparingly as a redshirt freshman in 1981–82, and the Cougars were eliminated in the Final Four by the eventual NCAA champion, North Carolina Tar Heels. Olajuwon sought advice from the coaching staff about how to increase his playing time, and they advised him to work out with local Houston resident and multiple NBA MVP winner, Moses Malone. Malone, who was then a center on the NBA's Houston Rockets, played games every off season with several NBA players at the Fonde Recreation Center. Olajuwon joined the workouts and went head to head with Malone in several games throughout the summer. Olajuwon credited this experience with rapidly improving his game: [...] "The way Moses helped me is by being out there playing and allowing me to go against that level of competition. He was the best center in the NBA at the time, so I was trying to improve <b>my</b> <b>game</b> against the best." ...|$|E
500|$|In August, del Potro won {{his third}} {{consecutive}} title at the Countrywide Classic in Los Angeles, beating Andy Roddick in straight sets in the final. After the match, Roddick praised his opponent. [...] " [...] hits {{this way and}} this way kind of equally and he can hit it from inside out and running to it, {{which is a good}} thing for him, bad for the rest of us". A fourth consecutive title followed a week later in the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C., where he recorded a victory over Viktor Troicki, becoming the first player in ATP history to win his first four career titles in as many tournaments. [...] "I don't really understand what I did. It is difficult to believe that I have won four consecutive titles", del Potro said, crediting coach Franco Davín for his impressive run. [...] "He changed <b>my</b> <b>game.</b> He changed my mind. He changed everything. When I play and I see him in the stands, it gives me confidence. I can play relaxed." ...|$|E
500|$|Lin {{sent his}} résumé and a DVD of {{highlights}} {{of his high}} school basketball career to all of the Ivy League schools; the University of California, Berkeley; and his dream schools, Stanford University and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The Pac-10 schools wanted him to walk-on, rather than be actively recruited or offered a sports scholarship. Harvard and Brown were the only teams that guaranteed him a spot on their basketball teams, but Ivy League schools do not offer athletic scholarships. Rex Walters, University of San Francisco men's basketball coach and retired NBA player, said NCAA limits on coaches' recruiting visits had reduced Lin's chances. [...] "Most colleges start recruiting a guy in the first five minutes they see him because he runs really fast, jumps really high, does the quick, easy thing to evaluate," [...] Walters said. Lin added, [...] "I just think in order for someone to understand <b>my</b> <b>game,</b> they have to watch me more than once, because I'm {{not going to do anything}} that's extra flashy or freakishly athletic." ...|$|E
5000|$|Shaw {{replied to}} criticism, [...] "Yes, I know I am nutty, but I am {{getting away with}} <b>my</b> <b>games.</b> I was bitten by a fox once."

500|$|Many rappers {{have taken}} note of Illmatics {{influence}} on their lyricism. Ghostface Killah recounted, “When I used to listen to Nas back in the days, it was like, ‘Oh shit! He murdered that.’ That forced me to get my pen game up... The whole Illmatic album forced you {{to go ahead and}} do shit... It was inspiration." [...] Detroit rapper Elzhi states, [...] "round the time Nas did Illmatic, it made me wanna step <b>my</b> <b>game</b> up... He's one of the reasons I did go off into storytelling because his pictures were so vivid. When he displayed his rhyme schemes and his word play and his songs, it made me wanna create visual pictures as well." [...] Casey Veggies also recounts the impact Nas' lyricism had on his own work as an underground rapper in the 2000s: “I [...] Illmatic when I was 14, 15. I didn’t get onto to it till late, but when I did, that's probably the only thing I listened to for six months to a year... After I got heavy on Illmatic, I put out Sleeping In Class (2010). That's when I really tried to sharpen my skills and get better.” ...|$|E

James Ernest says, in the game rules, [...] "I’ve decided to try a different gamble. I’m giving <b>my</b> <b>games</b> away for free. This way, {{you can read the}} rules, make a copy, and even play the thing, before you decide what it’s worth. If you do like <b>my</b> <b>games,</b> I hope you will send me some money.
