5|$|Evergreen Terrace {{is holding}} a street-wide rummage sale in Springfield. As Homer dances on tables selling items, there is a diversion: the empty {{house across the street}} is being moved into. It is {{occupied}} by former President George H. W. Bush and his wife Barbara. Bart decides to visit, and Barbara takes a liking to him, but his overall rebellious attitude annoys George. Eventually, after he accidentally shreds George's memoirs, the former President spanks Bart. An outraged Homer confronts George and both men vow to <b>make</b> <b>trouble</b> for each other.|$|E
5|$|An early {{concept for}} The Rite of Spring was {{to extend the}} story {{to the age of}} mammals and the first humans and the {{discovery}} of fire and man's triumph. John Hubley, the segment's art director, explained that it was later curtailed by Disney to avoid controversy from creationists, who promised to <b>make</b> <b>trouble</b> should he connect evolution with humans. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the history of the planet the studio received guidance from Roy Chapman Andrews, the director of the American Museum of Natural History, English biologist Julian Huxley, paleontologist Barnum Brown, and astronomer Edwin Hubble. Animators studied comets and nebulae at the Mount Wilson Observatory, and observed a herd of iguanas and a baby alligator that were brought into the studio. The camera was kept at a low position throughout the segment to heighten the immensity of the dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Parkman also {{believed}} that Pontiac's War had been secretly instigated by French colonists who were stirring up the Native Americans in order to <b>make</b> <b>trouble</b> for the British. This belief was widely held by British officials at the time, but subsequent historians have {{found no evidence of}} official French involvement in the uprising. (The rumor of French instigation arose in part because French war belts from the Seven Years' War were still in circulation in some Native villages.) Rather than the French stirring up the Native Americans, some historians now argue that the Native Americans were trying to stir up the French. Pontiac and other native leaders frequently spoke of the imminent return of French power and the revival of the Franco-Native alliance; Pontiac even flew a French flag in his village. All of this was apparently intended to inspire the French to rejoin the struggle against the British. Although some French colonists and traders supported the uprising, the war was initiated and conducted by Native Americans who had Native—not French—objectives.|$|E

The definitive test of strength came in 1950 during a nationwide general strike and mounting street clashes. On one day in March 1950, hundreds were wounded, including many policemen, and 7,000 people were arrested.|$|E
25|$|Along with {{fighting}} off efforts to overthrow him, President Dávila made some attempts to modernize Honduras. He invited a Chilean officer {{to establish a}} regular military academy, which failed to survive beyond his time in office. Like his predecessor, Dávila encouraged {{the activities of the}} banana companies. The companies, however, were less than totally happy with him, viewing his administration as ineffective. In addition, rivalry among the companies became a factor in Honduran politics. In 1910 Dávila's administration granted the Vaccaro brothers a generous rail concession that included a provision prohibiting any rival line within twenty kilometers. This concession angered Samuel Zemurray of the newly formed Cuyamel Fruit Company. Zemurray had encouraged and even helped finance the 1908 invasion and was to continue to <b>make</b> <b>trouble</b> for the Dávila administration.|$|E

25|$|At 8:30 AM on July 24, Stokes {{met with}} 100 African American civic leaders at City Hall to discuss {{ways to prevent}} the {{violence}} from flaring up again. Although no consensus for action emerged, most of the attendees felt that continued police presence would merely inflame tensions, and a few felt that a curfew would do little except build resentment while not preventing outsiders from coming into the area to <b>make</b> <b>trouble.</b> Early in the afternoon, {{a group of about}} 20 African American civic leaders (most, but not all, militants) suggested to Stokes that the black community be allowed to try to quell the violence on their own. A similar strategy had been proposed by a handful of black leaders during the night and at the 8:30 AM morning. At a meeting with Councilman Forbes and others held about 3:00 PM, Stokes discussed this plan. There was general agreement to try it, although General Del Corso was skeptical that it would succeed.|$|E
25|$|Andromeda is {{put to work}} {{developing}} a program to enable Britain to intercept orbital missiles which a foreign power is firing over British airspace as a demonstration of power. Using the missiles designed by Andromeda, they are successful in destroying one of the missiles. The Government is now determined to make full use of Andromeda, not just for defence but also to aid industry. Fleming continues to <b>make</b> <b>trouble</b> and has his access to the computer revoked. He is horrified {{to discover that the}} Government has made a trade deal with Kaufmann and Intel for the rights to a new enzyme that Andromeda has developed that heals injured cells. By this stage, Dawnay is also beginning to have doubts about Andromeda – she agrees to aid Fleming by entering a program into the computer to convince it Andromeda is dead. The program is quickly discovered and reversed by Andromeda. However, the computer soon exacts its revenge – it corrupts the formula for the enzyme, making Dawnay and her assistants sick.|$|E
500|$|Although Hesse was {{confident}} {{that he would be}} able to hold Gibraltar against the numerically superior Franco-Spanish force, he was undermined by political disputes between the Habsburg and English commanders. There was widespread resentment among the English marines that they had not been allowed to return with Rooke's fleet. There was a particularly poisonous relationship between the English Colonel of Marines Edward Fox and the Irish Colonel Henry Nugent, whom Hesse had appointed as Governor of Gibraltar. The two men had fought on opposite sides during the Irish campaign of William III; the Protestant Fox had gone on to serve Queen Anne, while the Catholic Nugent had joined the service of Charles of Austria. Hesse wrote that Fox was [...] "furious at being under my orders and at not being allowed to leave for England. His respect for the Governor I have appointed is even less. There is confusion everywhere. Orders are not carried out, and the officers are the first to <b>make</b> <b>trouble</b> [...] [...] [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|The Fremantle Jetty {{fell into}} disuse {{in the late}} 1890s due to the {{creation}} of the new Fremantle Harbour. Other factors also played a role in the demise of the Fremantle Long Jetty including the weather, geographical issues, and problems with how the port operated. All of these factors and more made the jetty a failure. It is also apparent that the users of this jetty found it and the port of Fremantle to be unsatisfactory.
