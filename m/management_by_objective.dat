40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to obtain, report and compare the {{judgments}} of selected public school administrators regarding <b>Management</b> <b>By</b> <b>Objectives</b> programs. The participating administrators were asked to make judgments related to expected benefits in the following management areas: (1) work expectations, (2) communication, (3) decision-making, (4) problem-solving, and (5) evaluation. Judgments were compared on the basis of management level of the administrators and size of the school district. The review of research and literature was conducted to determine the developmental evolution of the <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>objectives</b> movement in both the private and educational sectors. The research and literature review was reported in the following categories: (1) the historical development, (2) rationales for formulating and developing <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>objectives</b> programs, (3) expected benefits and liabilities of <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>objectives</b> programs, and (4) findings from research studies that have been conducted regarding <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>objectives</b> programs. Two specific research questions were developed regarding the judgments of administrators in relationship to <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>objectives.</b> Five null hypotheses were developed to examine each of the research questions. The statistical comparisons were made by using the chi square test of independence, with. 05 determined as the level of significance. The population selected to be included in the study consisted of one hundred fifty-three administrators from eleven school districts in the State of Pennsylvania. A <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>objectives</b> program had been developed and implemented in each school district included in the study. One hundred and two, or 67 %, of the selected administrators choose to participate in the study. The School Management Questionnaire was developed to collect the judgments of administrators regarding <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>objectives</b> programs. The School Management Questionnaire was developed from the review of related literature and from the materials used in a <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>objectives</b> workshop that had been conducted in each of the eleven school districts prior to the implementation of the <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>objectives</b> workshop. Significant findings developed from the study included the following: 1. There was a significant difference between the combined judgments of superintendents vs. central office administrators vs. principals vs. other administrators concerning the following management areas: (1) work expectations, (2) communications, (3) decision-making, (4) problem-solving, and (5) evaluation. 2. There was a significant difference between the combined judgments of administrators from small school districts (8, 249 or less students) and the combined judgments of administrators from large school districts (8, 250 or more students) in the management areas of work expectations and evaluation. 3. There was not a significant difference between the combined judgments of administrators from small school districts (8, 249 or less students) and the combined judgments of administrators from large school districts (8, 250 or more students) in the management areas of communication, decision-making and problem-solving. The following conclusions were developed from the findings: 1. The findings suggest that the implementation of a <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>objectives</b> program does not insure that the problem of evaluating administrative performance will be solved. 2. The findings indicate that central office administrators were more supportive of <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>objectives</b> programs than were principals, assistant principals and other non-central office administrators. 3. The findings suggest that the overall expected benefits of a <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>objectives</b> program, when measured by the responses to the School Management Questionnaire, did exist in the eleven school districts included in the study.

Employees&# 13; are appraised for several reasons, {{the most important of}} which is to realize the best use of human&# 13; resources and to plan for future needs; reward and punishment are secondary. Assessment Centre&# 13; evaluation or appraisal is valuable because it allows a candidate to concentrate on the task at hand. &# 13; Approach: The literature review and arguments were conducted to provide a systematic discussion of&# 13; the study. Results: In <b>Management</b> <b>by</b> <b>Objective</b> performance appraisal, employees are obliged to deal&# 13; with overcoming empirical challenges. In Assessment Centre Appraisal, the different outcomes for&# 13; particular tasks can be evaluated and management can assess employees relative proficiencies in terms&# 13; of these tasks. In both forms, consistency in criteria is crucial, for purposes of comparison and&# 13; standardization. Where comparisons are made with other employees, the criteria need to be parallel for&# 13; employees at similar levels of responsibility. Conclusion: Differences between organizational cultures&# 13; will impact on the way that assessment results are received under MBO performance appraisal as well. &# 13; The outcomes that employees achieve in the tasks provided for appraisal purposes may involve different&# 13; levels of risk, even within firm guidelines.

There have been times when teachers had to stage open protests to register their displeasure about head teachers ‟ management styles which they often described as administrative and managerial incompetency.

The study also attempts to look at and explain how head teachers ‟ informal relationship with teachers serves as a motivation for teachers to work to achieve institutional goals. The study sampled 100 senior high school teachers and 10 head teachers in the Sunyani Metropolis. These were sampled using the quota and simple random sampling procedures.

The rate of change experienced in the modern world is very fast and Church leadership is constantly challenged to change and adapt. Often the Church has turned to the business world for answers, solutions and guidance to remain relevant in terms of its leadership output.
