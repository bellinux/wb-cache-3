5|$|Increase {{the supply}} of labor and {{aggregate}} compensation by about 0.8 and 0.9 percent over the 2021-2025 period. CBO cited the ACA's expanded eligibility for <b>Medicaid</b> <b>and</b> subsidies and tax credits that rise with income as disincentives to work, so repealing the ACA would remove those disincentives, encouraging workers to supply more hours of labor.|$|E
5|$|The ACA {{includes}} {{provisions to}} take effect between 2010 and 2020, although most took effect on January 1, 2014. Few areas of the US health care system were left untouched, making it the most sweeping health care reform since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. However, some areas were more affected than others. The individual insurance market was radically overhauled, {{and many of the}} law's regulations applied specifically to this market, while the structure of Medicare, <b>Medicaid,</b> <b>and</b> the employer market were largely retained. Most of the coverage gains were made through the expansion of <b>Medicaid,</b> <b>and</b> the biggest cost savings were made in Medicare. Some regulations applied to the employer market, and the law also made delivery system changes that affected most of the health care system. Not all provisions took full effect. Some were made discretionary, some were deferred, and others were repealed before implementation.|$|E

5|$|The {{mayor and}} council set local taxes and a budget, {{which must be}} {{approved}} by Congress. The Government Accountability Office and other analysts have estimated that the city's high percentage of tax-exempt property and the Congressional prohibition of commuter taxes create a structural deficit in the District's local budget of anywhere between $470million and over $1billion per year. Congress typically provides additional grants for federal programs such as <b>Medicaid</b> <b>and</b> the operation of the local justice system; however, analysts claim that the payments do not fully resolve the imbalance.|$|E

5|$|States that {{rejected}} the Medicaid expansion could maintain their Medicaid eligibility thresholds, which {{in many states}} were significantly below 133% of the poverty line. Many states did not make Medicaid available to childless adults at any income level. Because subsidies on exchange insurance plans were not available to those below the poverty line, such individuals had no new options. For example, in Kansas, where only able-bodied adults with children and with an income below 32% of the poverty line were eligible for Medicaid, those with incomes from 32% to 100% of the poverty level ($6,250 to $19,530 {{for a family of}} three) were ineligible for both <b>Medicaid</b> <b>and</b> federal subsidies to buy insurance. Absent children, able-bodied adults were not eligible for Medicaid in Kansas.|$|E

5|$|Ryan's budget plans {{proposed}} privatizing Medicare {{for those}} {{under the age}} of 55, and funding <b>Medicaid</b> <b>and</b> the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program through block grants to the states. In 2012 Ryan proposed that Medicaid be converted into block grants, but with the federal government's share of the cost cut by some $800 billion over the next decade. Currently, Medicaid is administered by the states, subject to federal rules concerning eligibility, and the amount paid by the federal government depends on {{the number of people who}} qualify. His plan would have undone a Reagan-era reform by which the federal government prohibited the states from requiring that a patient's spouse, as well as the patient, deplete all of his or her assets before Medicaid would cover long-term care. Ryan’s budget plan proposed raising the Medicare eligibility age, beginning in 2023, by two months a year, until it reached 67 in 2034. A 2011 analysis, conducted by the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research group, for the Kaiser Family Foundation, estimated that Ryan's 2011 plan would have resulted in 14 million to 27 million fewer people receiving Medicaid coverage by 2021.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this work was to, among frail dually {{eligible}} older adults, determine risk factors for the likelihood of using Medicare home health <b>and</b> <b>Medicaid</b> home health services and to, among service users, determine correlates of Medicare home health, <b>Medicaid</b> home health, <b>and</b> <b>Medicaid</b> waiver service expenditures. Design and Methods: Dually eligible individuals enrolled in Connecticut’s Medicaid home-and community-based services (HCBS) waiver pro-gram for the aged (N = 5, 232) were identified from a statewide database containing person-level linked data from Medicare claims, <b>Medicaid</b> claims, <b>and</b> uniform clinical assessment forms. Expenditures, based on claims data, were observed from the month following clinical assessment over the period August 1995 to December 1997. Results: In multivariate models controlling for medical conditions and socio-demographic variables, similar functional disability measures were strongly associated with the prob-ability of the use of, and expenditures for, Medi-care home health <b>and</b> <b>Medicaid</b> home health services; severe cognitive impairment was strongly associated with greater Medicaid waiver service expenditures. Implications: Given the similarity of factors associated with Medicare <b>and</b> <b>Medicaid</b> home health service use and expenditures, greater integration of Medicare <b>and</b> <b>Medicaid</b> financing, reimbursement, <b>and</b> delivery strategies for home health services may be feasible and warranted for dually eligible older adults enrolled in state Medicaid HCBS waiver programs...|$|R
40|$|An {{estimated}} 3 - 10 % of the $ 2 trillion spent {{annually on}} {{health care in the}} United States is lost to fraud. Improper payments undermine the integrity and financial sustainability of the <b>Medicaid</b> program <b>and</b> affect the ability of federal and state governments to provide health care services for individuals and families living at or below the poverty level. This study explored how health care leaders in the state of Arizona described factors contributing to the invisible nature of <b>Medicaid</b> fraud <b>and</b> abuse and necessary strategies for counteracting the business opportunities of <b>Medicaid</b> fraud <b>and</b> abuse. The institutional choice analytic framework grounded the study. Data were gathered from the review of documents and information received from 10 interviews with health care leaders responsible for the administration, delivery, <b>and</b> regulation of <b>Medicaid</b> services in Arizona. Collected data were coded to identify underlying themes. Key themes that emerged from the study included the need for health care leaders to use modern technologies to combat <b>Medicaid</b> fraud <b>and</b> abuse and concentrate <b>and</b> strengthen <b>Medicaid</b> fraud <b>and</b> abuse mitigation efforts at the state level. Study data might contribute to social change by identifying <b>Medicaid</b> fraud <b>and</b> abuse mitigation strategies that will protect the financial and structural integrity of the Medicaid program, ensuring Americans living at or below the poverty level have access to quality health care services...|$|R
