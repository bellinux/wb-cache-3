40|$|For decades, general {{international}} law has recognized that international obligations {{can be divided into}} two types, i. e. bilateral obligations and <b>multilateral</b> <b>obligations,</b> according to their own legal nature. Today, <b>multilateral</b> <b>obligations</b> are furthermore divided into erga omnes obligations and erga omnes partes obligations. The former is the obligations owed to the international community as a whole and the latter is the obligations owed to a group of States for the protection of a collective interest of the group. Contrary to general {{international law}}, for a long time, WTO law has been silent regarding the legal nature of obligations imposed on their Member States. It would be easy to consider GATT obligations as bilateral, because trade is a transaction between two states; that is to say, trade is bilateral behavior. However, WTO law is not as simple as GATT. WTO law treats not only goods but also services, intellectual property rights and other technical or sanitary matters, so that it would covers a wide range of rights and obligations. This article clarifies the legal nature of obligations accruing to Member States under the actual WTO law on the basis of {{general international law}}...|$|E
40|$|An important, though oft neglected, {{distinction}} between multilateral treaty obligations separates obligations of the bilateral nature {{from those of}} the collective or erga omnes partes type. <b>Multilateral</b> <b>obligations</b> of the bilateral type can be reduced to a compilation of bilateral, state-to-state relations. They can be compared to contracts. Collective obligations, in contrast, cannot be divided into bilateral components. They are concluded in pursuit of a collective interest that transcends the individual interests of the contracting parties. The standard example of such obligations are those arising under a human rights treaty. In domestic law, collective obligations can be compared to criminal law statutes or even domestic constitutions. This essay examines the origins of the {{distinction between}} bilateral and collective obligations, as well as its major consequences, both in law of treaties and the law on state responsibility. On that basis, a wider typology of multilateral treaty obligations is suggested. In the exercise, obligations arising under the World Trade Organization are used as a case study. The argument is made that WTO obligations remain essentially of the bilateral type; they are not collective in nature...|$|E
40|$|The end of {{the twentieth}} century was marked by a sea change in global {{governance}} in the realm of intellectual property rights (IPRs). Whereas countries historically retained substantial autonomy with regard to what they defined as intellectual "property" and the rights granted to the owners of intellectual property, the 1990 s witnessed the establishment of new global obligations regarding national practices. This paper focuses on the case of software "piracy" to assess the mechanisms by which the new global obligations for the treatment of IPRs are transmitted from the international to the national levels. We first consider a set of national-level factors that many scholars have shown to be important determinants of IPR policy. We then supplement the standard emphasis on domestic factors with an analysis of new transnational factors: countries' <b>multilateral</b> <b>obligations</b> under the World Trade Organization's (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and bilateral pressures from the United States to increase the protection of IPRs. Population-averaged panel data models are used to assess the effects of these national and transnational determinants on levels of software piracy in 80 countries from 1994 to 2002. Our results indicate that membership in the WTO and bilateral pressures from the United States—particularly pressures that offer reciprocal concessions—lead to substantial increases in levels of protection in rich and poor countries. There is, in short, a new international political economy of intellectual property...|$|E

40|$|In this Article I {{examine the}} concept of {{necessity}} as an excuse or justification for a State 2 ̆ 7 s breach of an international legal obligation from a practical and theoretical perspective. I will show that while {{the concept of}} a state of necessity as understood by the International Law Commission (ILC) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ) may be applicable in respect of non-fulfilment by States of human rights obligations, the balancing test in the provisionally-adopted text of article 33 of the ILC 2 ̆ 7 s Draft Articles on State Responsibility 6 is designed to weigh inconsistent interests of two States rather than interests of a State against interests of a community of States and is thus ill-suited for the context of erga omnes and <b>multilateral</b> <b>obligations</b> that human rights norms entail. As a consequence, necessity, as expressed in the current text of article 33, could too easily allow a State to excuse its non-compliance with international human rights obligations in situations of threat to an essential interest of the State. That is to say, by way of a practical example, that a State could close its borders to a large-scale influx of asylum-seekers and excuse its non-compliance with its international duty not to expose asylum-seekers to the risk of persecution by asserting that the influx would threaten an essential State interest, such as the preservation of internal order and security...|$|E
40|$|The law of treaty {{reservations}} - {{which enables}} states {{to ask that}} their <b>multilateral</b> <b>obligations</b> be tailored to their individual preferences - has been controversial for over fifty years, and is at present subject to pitched battles within (and between) the International Law Commission and numerous other international institutions. There is broad agreement that existing scheme under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties involves a sharp tradeoff between honoring the unalloyed consent of non-reserving states (that is, those agreeing to the treaty as originally negotiated, which may object to proposed reservations) and respecting the conditioned consent of reserving states; moreover, it is thought to decisively favor the latter, leading to a surplus of treaty reservations and a paucity of objections to them. The ambiguities that pervade the Convention are said to play a supporting role. Whatever their cause, it is thought, such ambiguities tend to disadvantage non-reserving states; the straightforward solution is to resolve those ambiguities, preferably by making reservations harder to pull off. This approach is seriously flawed. In fact, the law of treaty reservations - understood as reflecting, rather than surmounting, its frustrating ambiguities - plausibly serves the interests of its supposed victims, the non-reserving states, perhaps even {{to a greater degree}} than for inveterate reservers. Treaty reservations not only increase the breadth of treaty participation, but permit agreement on broader commitments than would otherwise be possible. These effects inure to the benefit of reserving and non-reserving states alike. But deeper commitments, coupled with reservations, also establish a reliable, low-cost mechanism for providing information on reserving states, something facilitated by the existing scheme 2 ̆ 7 s eccentricities. Those same eccentricities also enable non-reserving states to reserve their own judgment regarding the acceptability of reservations, and thus shift risk control back (somewhat) in their favor...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand of}} industrialized {{countries}} for a multilateral agreement on investment {{to be negotiated}} under {{the roof of the}} WTO is meeting with considerable resistance on the part of developing countries. The proponents of such a multilateral agreement argue that binding disciplines of capital-importing countries would help reduce uncertainty and, hence, result in more foreign direct investment (FDI) in developing countries. By contrast, the opponents consider such an agreement to be biased in favor of business interests and against the development objectives of Third World economies. It is for various reasons that the case for a multilateral agreement on investment is not compelling: Investment regulations have been liberalized progressively by unilateral measures without <b>multilateral</b> <b>obligations</b> to do so. Moreover, the protection of foreign investors against political risk is fairly advanced given the large number of bilateral and plurilateral investment treaties. A multilateral agreement could reduce FDI-related transaction costs significantly only in the unlikely event that the complex net of existing arrangements would be replaced. A “WTO plus”-type framework appears to be the more realistic outcome of negotiations, with a multilateral agreement defining the smallest common denominator of WTO members and more substantive agreements with limited membership remaining in place. Empirical evidence suggests that WTO negotiations on investment are neither sufficient nor necessary to induce higher FDI flows to developing countries. Transaction-cost-related impediments to FDI have played a minor role in driving FDI, and the absence of a multilateral agreement has not prevented the recent boom of FDI in developing countries. Wishful thinking prevails on the part of developing countries, which insist on preferential treatment with regard to their own obligations as host countries and on binding obligations for foreign investors and their home countries. It is highly questionable whether developing countries could derive more benefits from FDI if a multilateral agreement were to include “development clauses” allowing for flexible and selective approval procedures and performance requirements such as local-content rules. The call for binding rules on the behavior of foreign investors may discourage multinational enterprises from investing in developing countries altogether, instead of fostering transfers of technology and improving the quality of FDI. By insisting on preferential treatment with regard to FDI incentives, developing countries tend to ignore that incentives- based competition for FDI is mainly between themselves. Unless developing countries are prepared to tie their own hands, they cannot reasonably expect significant concessions from industrialized countries. Developing countries will become relevant negotiation partners in the WTO only by offering something on their own. Rather than engaging in a futile attempt to block multilateral negotiations on investment altogether, developing countries should commit themselves to rulebased FDI policies as a negotiating chip. The pressure on industrialized countries to engage in negotiations on labor mobility would mount if developing countries refrained from performance requirements and granted national treatment to foreign investors.

Evidence on the variety of discrimination implemented by governments, characteristics of the recent systemic crisis, {{as well as on}} certain, often overlooked features of WTO obligations are used to support a conclusion that the WTO rules altered at most the composition of crisis-era protectionism.

Pessimistic implications are drawn concerning the future restraining role that <b>multilateral</b> trade <b>obligations</b> could ever play during systemic economic crises.

Commentators have especially focused on the potential conflict with the WTO agreements arising from restrictions on trade in genetically modified organisms as well as from the CBD provisions on access to genetic resources and sharing of benefits resulting from their utilization. Following the Nagoya Protocol, both issues are now regulated under protocols to the CBD. As the purpose of these protocols is to operationalize the programmatic and frequently vague provisions of the CBD, it is foreseeable that, as already occurred with the Cartagena Protocol, the adoption and implementation of the Nagoya Protocol will generate a new wave of enhanced policy and scholarly discussions on its compatibility with the world trade system. After a preliminary consideration of the scope of the NP and the nature of its obligations, this chapter will present an overview of the main substantive trade issues arising from the Protocol.
