40|$|Land {{transmission}} pipelines {{are one of}} the common ways, in Europe as {{in other parts of the}} world, to carry large amounts of hazardous goods through great distances. In Western Europe, the length of transmission networks is estimated to be about 180 000 km for gas (natural gas), 31 000 km for oil products and 10 000 km for other chemical substances. Although most of these hazardous goods are in the scope of the Seveso II Directive, this Directive does not apply to land {{transmission pipelines}} [...] . According to several accidents analysis, pipelines accidents may have a gravity equivalent to major accidents from fixed installations. This statement motivates EC members to have safety directive as Seveso II directive. In this context, the French Ministry of Economy, Finance and Industry (MinEFI), which is the national authority in charge of land transmission pipelines safety, mandated INERIS to perform a study about control of <b>major-accident</b> <b>hazards</b> involving these pipelines. The paper will give some preliminary results based mostly on a state of the art study of risk assessment on transmission pipeline.

The performance indicators are linked to a reference values or policy targets, illustrating how far the SMS is from the desired level. We developed a system of performance indicators for SMS in chemical industry by using the concept of environmental performance indicators defined in standard ISO 14031. A set of three types of safety system performance indicators was proposed: management performance indicators, operational performance indicators and safety status indicators. These indicators represent the most important factors in the linkage between a possible cause of an accident and its effects...|$|R

40|$|The Council Directive 96 / 82 /EC of 9 December 1996 {{concerns}} {{the control of}} <b>major-accident</b> <b>hazards</b> involving dangerous substances. It is known as SEVESO II Directive. It aims at the prevention of major accidents and the limitation of their consequences for men and environment. It applies to industries that use {{a significant amount of}} hazardous materials. Operators of such industries must demonstrate that they have assessed the risks and manage it. They must define a major accident prevention policy (MAPP), a safety management system (SMS) and finally an adequate response plan in case of emergency. As the documents produced by the operators have to be demonstrative, it would be useful that the analysis led by the operators follows a methodology recognised by the Competent Authorities and the decision-makers in charge of risk control. The approach described in this paper is being elaborated for that purpose. It derives from the French deterministic approach and will include a formalised analysis of the safety measures taken by operators to prevent major accidents...|$|R
40|$|No single {{property}} can be {{used for}} assessing the fire hazards of chemical substances and materials; different methods use different fire hazard properties in their assessment. On the other hand, current methodologies and classification systems usually use linguistic variables corresponding to specific range of values, for the classification of different hazards. Moreover, many uncertainties are present in the assessment of industrial hazards or industrial accidents consequences. In this paper, a new approach for the rapid assessment and relative ranking of the hazards of chemical substances, as well as units and installations, is presented. This approach is based on employing a multi-criteria decision-making technique (the Analytic Hierarchy Process) for the hazard assessment of substances and installations. The multi-criteria approach aims in the better incorporation of the different properties or parameters in hazard assessment. This approach is also based on fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic is considered better for dealing both with linguistic variables and uncertainties. A number of Indices have been developed, based on the proposed methodology and are presented: the 'Substance Fire Hazard Index', (SFHI), which is focused on the <b>major-accident</b> <b>hazards</b> of the substances, and the 'Consequences Index', (CI), for the assessment of the consequences potential of an accident at the facility. The challenges and limitations of using the multi-criteria approach for the development of such indices are also discussed. © 2005 Institution of Chemical Engineers...|$|R
40|$|Safety Management Systems (SMS) are now {{required}} {{in a lot}} of establishments handling hazardous substances in Europe in application of the council directive 96 / 82 /EC of 9 th December 1996 on the control of <b>major-accident</b> <b>hazards</b> involving dangerous substances, known as SEVESO 2 Directive. The Human Factors play obviously an important part in the effectiveness of those safety management systems. Indeed the system depends on the involvement of the people in charge of applying it. Considering the Human Factors from this angle leads the risk analyst to look at the organisation also through its social aspect. The question raised becomes therefore how the relationships, the power plays between workers, the cultural influences can interact with the intended prevention goals of the SMS. The idea would be to allow the risk analyst to foresee the creation mechanisms of the organisational shortcomings at the origin of the major accident. In this paper the author describes the development of a risk analysis approach that creates a focus on the link between the major accident hazards and the activities of the SMS, taking into account the real activities operated for the prevention process. This is a new approach where the individual is not the focus point, like traditionally in the formal Human Error or Human Factor approaches. The individual is considered {{in the context of the}} organisation, in its relation with others, in its relation with the processes of the organisation...|$|R

Due to the complexity of the industrial systems and their own dynamic in time and space, these risk assessment methods need to be supported by a systemic vision of their processes. Based on the systemic theory introduced by Forrester, this paper aims to propose a methodology to modeling and simulate the functioning of a chlorine storage and distribution unit, in order to promote a better risk prevention. This methodology include four complementary steps: i) the modeling of the system using the systemic theory principles and terms; ii) the implementation of this model into a Dynamic System platform for its simulation; iii) the simulation of the system using normal and abnormal scenarios in order to identify and to estimate the consequences of these deviations; iv) the assessment of the proposed barriers efficiency. After the application of this systemic methodology, these results are introduced into a HAZOP analyze to support the experts' risk assessment.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{analyses}} cur-rent {{trends in}} the development and use of acute exposure levels in Europe for the implementation of the Seveso II Directive [Council Directive 96 / 82 /EC of December 9, 1996 on the control of <b>major-accident</b> <b>hazards</b> involving dangerous substances. Official Journal of the European Communities, vol. L 10, January 14, 1997, Luxembourg, pp. 13 - 33]. It also describes a new initiative to develop a European methodology for deriving acute exposure threshold levels that responds to emerging needs in this area. The need for acute exposure values to predict human health effects of potential accidents on exposed populations has burgeoned in recent years. As the driving legislation for managing industrial hazards in Europe, the Seveso II Directive has particularly influenced this trend. Yet at this time it is questionable whether the availability and range of acute exposure values for toxic substances has kept apace with the growing need. Results of a survey of Seveso II competent authorities in the EU- 15 revealed that a variety of different types of acute exposure values (AEGLs, EPRGs, etc.) are used for Seveso II applications. Moreover, a comparison of these values indicates gaps in coverage of substances as well as inconsistencies in terms of how health effects and exposure periods are defined for each type. These findings highlight an opportunity for greater collaboration on scientific inputs to application of the Directive in Europe. The ACUTEX project is an EU-funded research project aimed at furthering scientific exchange and collaboration in support of the development of acute exposure levels for toxic substances in Europe. Its goal is to develop a European methodology for deriving acute exposure threshold levels (AETLs). In particular, it provides the possibility for a common European platform for developing additional acute exposure values to meet emerging needs and cover more chemical substances. To maximise success, the work plan is designed to meet two very important challenges, the need to complement and add value to the existing array of acute exposure methodologies and the necessity of meeting requirements of a diverse range of European stakeholders. As such the project will draw on collaboration among European scientists and process of deliberation among stakeholders to deliver the following key results: (1) to facilitate wide acceptance of the methodology in Europe by both the scientific community and communities of different end-users; (2) to provide greater equivalence and transparency in implementation of the Seveso II Directive across the Member States, specifically through the development of common scientific bases for assessing risks and making risk management decisions related to toxic releases; (3) to produce a methodology that remains open to future collaboration on derivation of acute exposure levels on a European and a global basis...|$|R
