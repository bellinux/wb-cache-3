This movement, although not authorized by <b>me,</b> <b>has</b> assumed such an aspect that it becomes my duty, as the executive of this Sate, to interpose my official authority to prevent a collision between the people of the State and the Federal troops under your command. I therefore demand in the name of the State the delivery of the possession of the Arsenal and munitions of war under your charge to the State authorities, to be held subject to the action of the convention to be held on the 4th of March next.|$|E

500|$|The Spy Who Loved Me {{was written}} in Jamaica at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in January and February 1961, and was the {{shortest}} manuscript Fleming had produced for a novel, being only 113 pages long. Fleming found the book the easiest for him to write, and apologised to his editor at Jonathan Cape for the ease. The Spy Who Loved <b>Me</b> <b>has</b> been described by Fleming biographer Andrew Lycett as Fleming's [...] "most sleazy and violent story ever", {{which may have been}} indicative of his state of mind at the time.|$|E
500|$|Ramanujan {{has been}} {{described}} as a person of a somewhat shy and quiet disposition, a dignified man with pleasant manners. He lived a rather Spartan life at Cambridge. Ramanujan's first Indian biographers describe him as a rigorously orthodox Hindu. He credited his acumen to his family goddess, Mahalakshmi of Namakkal. He looked to her for inspiration in his work and said he dreamed of blood drops that symbolised her male consort, Narasimha. Afterward he would receive visions of scrolls of complex mathematical content unfolding before his eyes. He often said, [...] "An equation for <b>me</b> <b>has</b> no meaning unless it represents a thought of God." ...|$|E
500|$|Newton likely {{introduced}} her to the writings of William Wordsworth, and his gift to her of Ralph Waldo Emerson's first book of collected poems had a liberating effect. She wrote later that he, [...] "whose name my Father's Law Student taught <b>me,</b> <b>has</b> touched the secret Spring". Newton held her in high regard, believing in and recognizing her as a poet. When he was dying of tuberculosis, he wrote to her, saying {{that he would like}} to live until she achieved the greatness he foresaw. Biographers believe that Dickinson's statement of 1862—"When a little Girl, I had a friend, who taught me Immortality– but venturing too near, himself– he never returned"—refers to Newton.|$|E

The Jets defeated the Raiders, 27–23. Two weeks later, the Jets defeated the Colts in the Super Bowl. According to sportswriter Doyle Dietz, in the Jets' upset victory (the Colts were favored by as many as 19½ points), [...] "the American Football League came of age".

500|$|The {{author was}} well aware that his was the first {{cookbook}} in the Polish vernacular, which he made clear in the dedication. [...] "As no one before <b>me</b> <b>has</b> yet wished {{to present to the}} world such useful knowledge in our Polish language," [...] he wrote in his opening line, [...] "I have dared, ... despite my ineptitude, to offer the Polish world my compendium ferculorum, or collection of dishes." [...] Polish bibliographer [...] maintained that Compendium ferculorum was preceded by Kuchmistrzostwo (Cooking Mastery), a 16th-century Polish translation of the Czech cookbook [...] (Cookery) written by [...] in 1535. However, no copies of this supposed translation have survived, except for facsimiles of two folios, published in 1891, of uncertain authenticity. Whatever the case, Czerniecki's work is without a doubt the oldest known cookbook published originally in Polish.|$|E

This poor touring form {{may have been the}} start of the troubles that would rule him out of international cricket in the future.

500|$|All That Is Within Me {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics, {{some of which}} considered it MercyMe's best record to that point. However, some critics felt the album was too similar to the band's previous works. The album sold 84,000 copies in its first week, debuting at {{number one on the}} Billboard Christian Albums chart and number 15 on the Billboard 200. Three singles were released to radio: [...] "God with Us", which spent eight weeks at number one on the Billboard Christian Songs chart, [...] "You Reign", which peaked at number two on the Christian Songs chart and spent four weeks atop the Billboard Christian AC Songs chart, and [...] "Finally Home", which peaked at number three on the Christian Songs chart and number 16 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart.

500|$|During {{the early}} part of the fighting, Colonel Powell was accidentally shot in the back from {{friendly}} fire. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry, without its two highest-ranking officers (Powell and Hoffman), became disorganized. A portion of the cavalry was trapped in the open against shooters protected by buildings, and many dismounted either for their own safety or because their horse had been shot. At that time, Colonel Toland hurried forward to run the leaderless dismounted cavalry. [...] Freeman and the infantry were already further south in town. The cavalry believed their behavior was appropriate for the situation, and advised Colonel Toland to act in a similar manner. Toland, still on his horse, became an easy target for shooters from a nearby two-story brick house. Despite warnings from the cavalry's Company H that he should take cover, Toland refused to dismount—saying [...] "the bullet that can kill <b>me</b> <b>has</b> not been made". He was shot through the heart immediately after his exclamation. This happened early in the fighting, and men from the 2nd West Virginia's Company H were close enough to hear the bullet strike him. Thus, both colonels were eliminated from the fighting during the first 10 minutes.|$|E
