40|$|AbstractThis paper {{concerns}} a determination procedure for conformal mapping of a wing through a finite element computation of potential function {{associated with the}} flow of 2 -dimensional perfect fluid around the given <b>wing</b> <b>section.</b> Through our numerical procedure a family of mappings is obtained in the forms of finite Laurent series for an initial <b>wing</b> <b>section</b> input. Each {{member of the family}} describes a <b>wing</b> <b>section</b> located in a neighboring domain of the input one. Some of them could be expected as modified versions of the original <b>wing</b> <b>section</b> input, although they could not recover completely it. Inputting the shape of <b>wing</b> <b>section</b> has ambiguity in practical cases of <b>wing</b> <b>sections</b> such as the NACA 23012 <b>wing</b> <b>section.</b> We would like to postulate that our identification procedure should be employed in the determination process of numerical profiles of the <b>wing</b> <b>section</b> considered, since identified ones are significantly easier in numerical processing than the original input shape...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new geometric analysis procedure for <b>wing</b> <b>sections.</b> This procedure {{is based on}} the normal mode analysis for continuous functions. A set of special shape functions is introduced to represent the geometry of the <b>wing</b> <b>section.</b> The generators of the NACA 4 -digit airfoils were included in this set of shape functions. It is found that the supercritical <b>wing</b> <b>section,</b> Korn airfoil, could be well represented by a set of ten shape functions. Preliminary results showed that the number of parameters to define a <b>wing</b> <b>section</b> could be greatly reduced to about ten. Hence, the present research clearly advances the airfoil design technology by reducing the number of design variables. STATEMENT OF PROBLE...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} {{nonlinear}} aeroelastic response of a <b>wing</b> <b>section</b> with a continuous stiffening-type structural nonlinearity is examined through analytical and experimental studies. Motivated by the limited effectiveness {{of using a}} single, trailing-edge control surface for the suppression of limit-cycle oscillations of a typical <b>wing</b> <b>section,</b> improvements in the control of limit-cycle oscillations are investigated {{through the use of}} multiple control surfaces, namely, an additional leading-edge control surface. The control methodology consists of a feedback linearization approach that transforms the system equations of motion via Lie algebraic methods and a model reference adaptive control strategy that augments the closed-loop system to account for inexact cancellation of nonlinear terms due to modeling uncertainty. Specifically, uncertainty in the nonlinear pitch stiffness is examined. It is shown through simulations and experiments that globally stabilizing control may be achieved by using two control surfaces.

40|$|This report gives {{a simple}} and exact method of calculating the lift {{distribution}} on thin <b>wing</b> <b>sections.</b> The most essential feature of the new theory is the introduction of an "ideal angle of attack," this angle being defined as that at which the flow enters the leading edge smoothly or, more precisely, as the angle of attack at which the lift {{at the leading edge}} equals zero. The lift distribution at this particular angle is shown to be a characteristic property of the section and has been termed the "basic distribution. " it is shown that the lift of a <b>wing</b> <b>section</b> may always be considered to consist of (a) the basic distribution and (b) the additional distribution, where the latter is independent of the mean camber line and thus identical for all thin sections. The specific reason for the poor aerodynamic qualities of thin <b>wing</b> <b>sections</b> is pointed out as being {{due to the fact that}} the additional lift in potential flow becomes infinite at the leading edge. It is established that the essential parameter occurring in this analysis is the radius of curvature at the leading edge. It is further established that the actual slope of the lift curve is dependent on this parameter. The theoretical lift distribution is compared with the distribution obtained by direct measurement on a number of the more conventional <b>wing</b> <b>sections.</b> The new theory is of value in calculating the strength of <b>wing</b> <b>sections...</b>|$|R
