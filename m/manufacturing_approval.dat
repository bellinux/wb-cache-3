[...] Interneuron {{changed its name}} to Indevus in 2002 Indevus entered into a partnership with Odyssey Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Pliva, to market the drug in April 2004, and won FDA approval for the drug, which it branded as Sanctura, in May 2004. [...] The approval earned Indevus a milestone payment of $120M from Pliva, which had already paid Indevus $30 million at signing; the market for overactive bladder therapies was estimated to be worth $1.1 billion in 2004. [...] In 2005 Pliva exited the relationship, selling its rights to Esprit Pharma, and in September 2007 Allergan acquired Esprit, and negotiated a new agreement with Indevus under which Allergan would completely take over the US <b>manufacturing,</b> regulatory <b>approvals,</b> and marketing.

The BLRO approach is then used to value a parts <b>manufacturing</b> <b>approval</b> (PMA) license for an aerospace firm in the maintenance, repair, and overhaul industry. The model combines statistical decision theory with options pricing to evaluate strategic capital expenditures assuming a decision time horizon and posturing costs. Real option attributes are discussed in a decision analytic context and thresholds are identified for improved decision-making. In contrast to other models in the real options literature in which new information is passively introduced during the delay period, our approach encourages active information acquisition and quantifies {{its impact on the}} decision.

40|$|Cell-based therapies {{have been}} in use in {{veterinary}} medicine for years. However, the legal requirement of manufacturing, {{placing on the market}} and use of cell-based veterinary pharmaceuticals are not as well developed as the respective requirements of chemical pharmaceuticals. Cell-based veterinary pharmaceuticals are medicinal products {{in the sense of the}} pharmaceutical law of the European Union (EU). For that reason, such medicinal products principally require official approval for their manufacture and an official marketing authorisation for their placement on the market before being used by the veterinarian. The manufacture, placing on the market and use of cell-based veterinary pharmaceuticals without <b>manufacturing</b> <b>approval</b> and marketing authorisation is permitted only in certain exceptional cases determined by EU and individual Member State law. Violations of this requirement may have consequences for the respective veterinarian under criminal law and under the code of professional conduct in the respective Member State. The regular use of cell-based veterinary pharmaceuticals within the scope of a therapeutic emergency as well as the import of such veterinary pharmaceuticals from non-European countries for use in the EU are currently out of the question in the EU because of a lack of legal bases. Here, we review the general legal requirement of manufacturing, placing on the market and use of cell-based veterinary pharmaceuticals within the EU and point out different implementations of EU law within the different Member States...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSelective {{internal}} radiation therapy {{has emerged as}} a well-accepted therapeutic for primary and metastatic hepatic malignancies. This therapeutic modality requires the combined efforts of multiple medical disciplines to ensure the safe delivery of yttrium- 90 (90 Y) -labeled microspheres. The development of this therapy followed decades of clinical research involving tumor vascularity and microsphere development. Today, it is essential that treating physicians have a thorough understanding of hepatic tumor vascularity and 90 Y microsphere characteristics before undertaking this complex intervention. This review explores the contributions of early investigators of this therapy, as well as the development, US Food and Drug Administration <b>approval,</b> <b>manufacturing</b> process, and attributes of the 2 commercially available 90 Y radiolabeled microsphere device to clarify the key physical differences between the products...|$|R
30|$|In {{cases of}} chronic liver disease, {{multiple}} invasive procedures are often necessary, including endoscopic treatment for esophageal or gastric varices or hepatic cancer treatment with radiofrequency ablation. Although platelet transfusion is considered in many cases, complications such as inefficacy of transfusion, onset of unknown infection, or development of fever/allergic symptoms present clinical obstacles [1, 2]. The thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist lusutrombopag, which is administered prior to invasive procedures, {{was developed to}} improve platelet count and avoid the need for transfusions in patients with chronic liver disease complicated by thrombocytopenia. In September 2015, lusutrombopag obtained <b>manufacturing</b> and marketing <b>approval</b> in Japan and became the worldâ€™s first therapeutic agent of its kind [3, 4]. In the present report, we discuss {{a case in which}} pain management was performed during left renal artery embolization via continuous epidural anesthesia following oral administration of lusutrombopag. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first to discuss the use of lusutrombopag prior to epidural anesthesia.|$|R
2500|$|The wreck was {{examined}} and videotaped by remotely operated underwater vehicles and by divers from a Norwegian company, Rockwater A/S, contracted {{for the investigation}} work. The official report indicated that the locks on the bow door had failed from the strain of the waves and the door had separated {{from the rest of}} the vessel, pulling the ramp behind it ajar. The bow visor and ramp had been torn off at points that would not trigger an [...] "open" [...] or [...] "unlatched" [...] warning on the bridge, as is the case in normal operation or failure of the latches. The bridge was also situated too far back on the ferry for the visor to be seen from there. While there was video monitoring of the inner ramp, the monitor on the bridge was not visible from the conning station. The bow visor was under-designed, as <b>manufacturing</b> and <b>approval</b> process did not consider the visor and its attachments as critical items regarding ship safety. The first metallic bang was believed to have been the sound of the visor's lower locking mechanism failing, and subsequent noises were the visor 'flapping' against the hull as the other locks failed, before tearing free and exposing the bow ramp. The subsequent failure of the bow ramp allowed water into the vehicle deck, which was identified as the main cause of the capsizing and sinking: RORO ferries with their wide vehicle decks are particularly vulnerable to capsizing if the car deck is even slightly flooded because of free surface effect: the fluid's swirling motion across such a large area hampers the boat's ability to right itself after rolling with a wave.|$|R
40|$|The {{translation}} of dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) transplantation into clinic practice is hindered by the Good <b>Manufacturing</b> Practice (GMP) <b>approval</b> for in vitro autologous DPSC expansion. In order {{to circumvent the}} laboratory procedure, we proposed an unprecedented approach for regenerative endodontics â€“ direct dental pulp tissue grafting. This study has demonstrated that cells directly migrating out from dental pulp tissue explantation (DPTE), functioning as the putative cell source in our approach for tissue regeneration, exhibits stem cell properties such as elongated lifespan as well as multi-potent differentiation in vitro as equivalent to DPSC. Additionally, our data from ex vivo tissue engineering with either porous biodegradable scaffold (poly-L-Lactic acid) or injectable self-assembly scaffold (PuraMatrix Hydrogel) suggests that dental pulp tissue fragments are survivable and proliferative in three-dimensional culture, generating stem cell population with odontogenic differentiation potential as well as mineralization capacity. Consequently, this preliminary investigation has established the fundamental rationale for the utilization of direct pulp tissue grafting in pulp-dentin complex engineering, charting out a blueprint for subsequent studies of a brand-new technique for regenerative endodontics...|$|R

40|$|Tumor-related {{cerebral}} edema is {{a debilitating}} medical condition that afflicts {{tens of thousands}} of newly diagnosed brain cancer patients in the U. S. each year, where the standard care of treatment indicates the systemic administration of dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DXM) and surgery. The former is associated with toxic side effects, and the latter is an ineffective option. Local drug delivery to the desired site of therapy helps to circumvent the side effects of DXM. In this paper, the design of a novel, local drug delivery device was explored as a means to treat tumor-related cerebral edema. The novel device was then evaluated based on an analysis of the market environment in which it will be sold. This included discussion of the supply chain infrastructure and the challenges associated with the medical industry, an estimate of the addressable market size, growth and valuation, and an estimate of the novel product's cost compared to current edema treatment and the device's potential competitors. The methods by which the device could be commercialized were also discussed, specifically, strategies for obtaining FDA <b>approval,</b> <b>manufacturing</b> the device on a medium scale, protecting intellectual property, integrating the device into the supply chain, and an estimation of the financial investment needed to form a startup company. Finally, the technology that enables its desired application was evaluated, which included an assessment of the barriers to drug delivery, ideal characteristics of a successful drug delivery device, possible routes and means of administration, as well as other considerations pertinent to a successful drug delivery device. After completing the first iteration of the innovation cycle, it was concluded that the device deserves further investigation and investment, as it progresses from the lab bench to the marketplace. by Kamal A.

50|$|Prefabricated housing {{was popular}} during the Second World War {{due to the}} need for mass {{accommodation}} for military personnel. The United States used Quonset huts as military buildings, and in the United Kingdom prefabricated buildings used included Nissen huts and Bellman Hangars. 'Prefabs' were built after the war as a means of quickly and cheaply providing quality housing as a replacement for the housing destroyed during the Blitz. The proliferation of prefabricated housing across the country was a result of the Burt Committee and the Housing (Temporary Accommodation) Act 1944. Under the Ministry of Works Emergency Factory Made housing programme, a specification was drawn up and bid on by various private construction and <b>manufacturing</b> companies. After <b>approval</b> by the MoW, companies could bid on Council led development schemes, resulting in whole estates of prefabs constructed to provide accommodation for those made homeless by the War and ongoing slum clearance. Almost 160,000 had been built in the UK by 1948 at a cost of close to Â£216 million. The largest single prefab estate in Britain was at Belle Vale (South Liverpool), where more than 1,100 were built after World War 2. The estate was demolished in the 1960s amid much controversy as the prefabs were very popular with residents at the time.Prefabs were aimed at families, and typically had an entrance hall, two bedrooms (parents and children), a bathroom (a room with a bath) â€” which was a novel innovation for many Britons at that time, a separate toilet, a living room and an equipped (not fitted in the modern sense) kitchen. Construction materials included steel, aluminium, timber or asbestos, {{depending on the type of}} dwelling. The aluminium Type B2 prefab was produced as four pre-assembled sections which could be transported by lorry anywhere in the country.The Universal House (pictured left & lounge diner right) was given to the Chiltern Open Air Museum after 40 years temporary use. The Mark 3 was manufactured by the Universal Housing Company Ltd, Rickmansworth.|$|R
