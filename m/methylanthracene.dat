40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs), {{many of which}} are known carcinogens, are derived from the pyrolysis of organic ma-terials. A rich source of PAHs is cigarette smoke, which contains methylated anthracenes and phenanthrenes as the predominant PAHs. The tumor-promoting activity of cigarette smoke has been well documented. The down-regulation of gap junction intercellu-lar communication (GJIC) by nongenotoxic chemicals and several oncogenes has been implicated in tumor promotion. Therefore, we determined the effects of the three isomers of <b>methylanthracene</b> on GJIC in WB-F 344 rat liver epithelial cells. Anthracene and 2 -methylanthracene did not significantly inhibit GJIC, whereas anthracene methylated in the 1 or 9 position reversibly inhibited GJIC with /so values of 22 and 36 fiM, respectively. Inhibition occurred within 15 min. In conclusion, the biological effect of <b>methylanthracene</b> depends on the ring position of the methyl group, and these inhibitory isomers could play a potential role in tumor promotion of methylated PAH-rich mixtures such as ciga-rette Smoke and Crude Oil products. © 1996 Society of Toxicology. Polycyclic {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) are ubiquitous pollutants, some of which have been listed as priority pollut-ants by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (Shut-tleworth and Cerniglia, 1995). The primary sources of envi-ronmental contamination by PAHs are from human activities such as fossil fuel combustion and industrial processing and, to a lesser, extent from natural phenomena such as fores...|$|E
40|$|Thirteen Liassic {{sedimentary}} rocks of increasing depth and three petroleums from the Paris Basin were studied for 13 C/ 12 C isotopic compositions and biological markers, including steranes, sterenes, methylphenanthrenes, <b>methylanthracene</b> and triaromatic steroids. The isotopic compositions of n-alkanes from mature {{sedimentary rocks}} and petroleums fall {{in a narrow}} range (2 ‰) except for the deepest Hettangian rock and the Trias petroleum for which the short-chain n-alkanes are enriched and depleted in 13 C, respectively. Most of the molecular parameters increase over the 2000 - 2500 m depth range, reflecting {{the transformation of the}} organic matter at the onset of petroleum generation. In this zone, carbonate content and carbon isotopic composition of carbonates as well as molecular parameters are distinct for the Toarcian and Hettangian source rocks and suggest a migration of organic matter from these two formations. Two novel molecular parameters were defined for this task, one using methyltriaromatic steroids from organic extracts and the other using 1 -methylphenanthrene and 2 -methylanthracene from kerogen pyrolysates.

40|$|A new gravel-contact assay using rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, embryos was {{developed}} to assess the toxicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other hydrophobic compounds. Environmentally realistic exposure conditions were mimicked with a direct exposure of eyed rainbow trout embryos incubated onto chemical-spiked gravels until hatching at 10 °C. Several endpoints were recorded including survival, hatching delay, hatching success, biometry, developmental abnormalities, and DNA damage (comet and micronucleus assays). This bioassay was firstly tested with two model PAHs, fluoranthene and benzo[a]pyrene. Then, the method was applied to compare the toxicity of three PAH complex mixtures characterized by different PAH compositions: a pyrolytic extract from a PAH-contaminated sediment (Seine estuary, France) and two petrogenic extracts from Arabian Light and Erika oils, at two environmental concentrations, 3 and 10 μg g− 1 sum of PAHs. The degree and spectrum of toxicity were different according to the extract considered. Acute effects including embryo mortality and decreased hatching success were observed only for Erika oil extract. Arabian Light and pyrolytic extracts induced mainly sublethal effects including reduced larvae size and hemorrhages. Arabian Light and Erika extracts both induced repairable DNA damage as revealed by the comet assay versus the micronucleus assay. The concentration and proportion of methylphenanthrenes and <b>methylanthracenes</b> appeared to drive the toxicity of the three PAH fractions tested, featuring a toxic gradient as follows: pyrolytic[*]<[*]Arabian Light[*]<[*]Erika. The minimal concentration causing developmental defects was as low as 0. 7 μg g− 1 sum of PAHs, indicating the high sensitivity of the assay and validating its use for toxicity assessment of particle-bound pollutants...|$|R

Elemental analysis {{along with the}} molecular ion peak at m/z 270.05 [M]+· [...] agreed with the molecular formula C 15 H 10 O 5. The compound responded positively to the ferric chloride test indicating the presence of phenolic –OH group, which further confirmed with the broad peak at 3510  cm− 1 in the IR spectrum. The IR spectrum also displayed peak at 3056 and 2918  cm− 1 corresponded to aromatic and aliphatic C–H stretching vibrations. However, peaks at 1676 and 1625  cm− 1 corresponded to C=O and C=C bonds of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl functionality. The 1 H NMR spectrum of compound showed four meta-coupled doublets at δ 7.81, 7.65, 7.30 and 7.09 corresponded to aromatic protons H- 2, H- 4, H- 7 and H- 5, respectively. Singlet at δ 12.13 and 12.02 integrating for two and one protons, respectively, corresponded to hydroxyl protons. Moreover, sharp singlet at δ 2.46 integrating for three protons was assigned to methyl protons. The 13 C NMR spectrum exhibited peak for carbonyl carbons at δ 182.0 (C- 9) and 192.5 (C- 10), methyl carbon at δ 22.2, methyl substituted carbons at δ 149.3 (C- 3) and for hydroxyl substituted carbons at δ 162.4 (C- 1), 160.3 (C- 6) and 162.6 (C- 8). The spectrum also showed eight more peaks for aromatic carbons at δ 113.7 (C- 8 a), 121.3 (C- 7), 119.9 (C- 5), 133.8 (C- 5 a), 124.5 (C- 4), 134.0 (C- 4 a), 136.9 (C- 2) and 111.8 (C- 1 a). In the light of above data it was significantly concluded that compound 3 is 1, 3, 8 - trihydroxy - 6 - <b>methylanthracene</b> - 9, 10 - dione (Emodin) [19].|$|E
40|$|Opaque, viscous tars {{derived from}} the {{carbonization}} of fossile carbon feedstocks, such coal tars and creosote, are long-term sources of groundwater contamination, predominantly with poly- and heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). The dissolution, ageing and migratory behavior of dense, non aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) coal tar blobs and pools forming at the aquitard is not sufficiently understood to estimate the risk and adequately design groundwater treatment measures at a contaminated site. In this study, we investigate the composition and dissolution of a migrated, aged creosote DNAPL and corresponding experimental and groundwater profiles using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC-MS). GC-FID unresolved compounds were attributed to methylated homocyclic species using GCxGC-MS in the <b>Methylanthracene</b> weight range. Equilibrium concentrations were estimated using Raoult’s law, assuming non-ideal behavior. Low molecular weight compounds {{were found to be}} prevalent even after decades of weathering, with Naphthalene (8 % by mass) representing the most abundant identified compound, contrary to the expected preferential depletion of hydrophilic compounds. Morevoer, dimethylnaphthalenes were relatively more abundant in the aqueous boundary layer than in the DNAPL. DNAPL migration over 400 m with the groundwater flow effected lower viscosity and specific gravity of the migrated phase body in a superposition of weathering, transport and aquifer chromatography effects. Based on a decomposition of analysed and estimated constituents using the group contribution approach, reference DNAPL values for activity coefficients γi were used to model aqueous solubilities for selected compounds. Anthracene was close to its theoretical precipitation limit in the bulk DNAPL. While laboratory and modelled DNAPL dissolution behavior agree well, field data imply the presence of specific interfacial in situ processes significantly impacting dissolution processes. Based on aqueous GCxGC-MS profiles over the DNAPL, a hypothetical interfacial in situ film was calculated to be composed primarily of Phenanthrene, with minor contribution by Naphthalene, possibly forming a viscous barrier for the dissolution of lower molecular weight PAH. The main advances and gaps in electron donor DNAPL understanding are discussed regarding our conception of weathered, migrating hydrophobic DNAPL bodies in the aquifer of historic contaminated sites for the adequate treatment of contaminated water...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{reaction}} of various weak bases with 1, 3 -dimethyl- 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzene (DMTNB) in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) {{has been carried out}}. Conductance results indicated formation of a benzyl-type anionic species by abstraction of a methyl hydrogen from DMTNB. This was confirmed by spectroscopic techniques. Proton NMR studies of the reaction of base with 1, 3 -dimethyl- 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzene (DMTNB) 2, 2 ', 4, 4 ', 6 -pentanitro- 3, 5 '-dimethylbiphenyl (PNDMBP) and 2, 2 ', 4, 4 ', 6, 6 '-hexanitro- 3, 3 ' -dimethylbiphenyl (HNDMBP) showed the formation of mono-anionic species at low mole ratios of base and dianionic species at higher mole ratios of base to polynitroaromatic compound. The kinetics of the reaction of diethylenetriamine with DMTNB in DMSO and in DMSO/methanol have been studied and the values for the activation energy, enthalpy of reaction and entropy of reaction have been determined. A parametric study has been carried out on the reaction of base with DMTNB in the presence of cupric chloride, and the separation and identification of products from the reaction has been. attempted. Although none of the products could be characterised unambiguously, structures for the products, which could be polymeric in nature, have been tenatively suggested. Attempts have also been made to separate and characterise the products from the reaction of base with PNDMBP and HNDMBP in the presence of cupric chloride, but again the structures of the products could not be assigned unambiguously. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has been used to study the thermal decomposition ofDMTNB, 1, 3 -dicarboxy- 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzene (DCTNB), 1, 3 -bis-(2 - hydroxyethyl) - 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzene (DHTNB), PNDMBP and HNDMBP, and of mixtures of these compounds with weak bases in various mole ratios. The exothermic decomposition temperature, the enthalpy of decomposition and the activation energy of decomposition of the compounds have been determined, as well as the exothermic decomposition temperature of mixtures of these compounds with base. It has been oufnd that the presence of base lowers the exothermic decomposition temperature of the polynitroaromatic compound ie. the base sensitizes the decomposition of the compounds studied. The thermal decomposition of some solid state charge-transfer complexes formed between tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and 9 - <b>methylanthracene</b> (9 -MA) as eletron donors and DMTNB, DCTNB, PNDMBP, HNDMBP and 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) as eletron acceptors has been investigated by differential scanning calorimetry. The effect of complexation on the thermal behaviour of the donor and acceptor molecules has been noted, and the enthalpy of decomposition and activation energy for decomposition of selected complexes has been determined. A range of charge transfer complexes have been prepared using using various donors and acceptors and their composition characterised as 1 : 1 donor to acceptor. The eletrical conductivity of the complexes have been measured and iy has been found out that, although some had conductivity in the semiconductor range, the majority were insulators. The oxidation potential of the donors and the reductionpotentials of the acceptors have been determined using cylic voltammetry. The relative eletron acceptor abilities of DCTNB, PNDMBP and HNDMBP have been evaluated for their reduction potential values. The effect of interaction in solution between donor and acceptor species on the oxidation/ reduction potentials of the species has been investigated. The values for the eletron affinity of DMTNB, DCTNB and PNDMBP have been obtained from measurements on the visible absorption spectra of the complexes formed between these compounds and a number of anthracene derivatives...|$|E
