5|$|In 2014, total Scottish exports (excluding intra-UK trade) were {{estimated}} to be £27.5billion. Scotland's primary exports include whisky, electronics and financial services. The United States, Netherlands, Germany, France and Norway constitute the country's major export markets. Scotland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), including oil and gas produced in Scottish waters, was estimated at £150 billion for the calendar year 2012. If Scotland became independent, it would hold 95% of the UK's current oil and gas reserves if they were split geographically using a <b>median</b> <b>line</b> from the English-Scottish border. If the reserves were split by population, that figure would be reduced to 9%.|$|E

25|$|The Persian Gulf and its {{coastal areas}} are the world's largest single source of crude oil, and related {{industries}} dominate the region. Safaniya Oil Field, the world's largest offshore oilfield, {{is located in}} the Persian Gulf. Large gas finds have also been made, with Qatar and Iran sharing a giant field across the territorial <b>median</b> <b>line</b> (North Field in the Qatari sector; South Pars Field in the Iranian sector). Using this gas, Qatar has built up a substantial liquefied natural gas (LNG) and petrochemical industry.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} {{specimen}} contracted in alcohol is 20mm, the height and breadth are 9mm. Behind the shell, which is situated upon the hinder {{half of the}} body, the tail projects slightly. The end of the tail is flat, has no caudal mucous pit, and is bluntly pointed. The margin of the foot is produced into a slight flange. A pair of grooves running along the <b>median</b> <b>line</b> from the mantle to the muzzle define a row of small tubercles. Right and left, between this <b>median</b> <b>line</b> and the foot-edge, 2 indistinct grooves can be traced from the mantle to the lips. Posterior to these, the surface is divided into tubercles by small irregular grooves meandering outwards and downwards. The mantle has an even margin, with 2 small lappets on the under-side; the right proceeds forward from a little behind the respiratory pore (pneumostome), extends to almost one-third {{of the length of}} the mantle-margin, and forms a narrow fold; the left is minute, simply a rudiment, and in some specimens it is difficult to detect. The sole of the foot is without a defined median area. Two small labial tentacles are present. The color is reddish-brown, splashed with black, and darkest above. The mantle and sole are ashy-yellow.|$|E
25|$|Female {{is similar}} to the male. Upperside: ground colour with a slight greenish tinge. The orange patch on the forewing is more restricted, it {{consists}} of a series of brood streaks in interspaces 3 to 6 and 10, the outer apices of which are deeply incised by black and with a row of hastate orange spots beyond in interspaces 2 to 6. Hindwing: similar to the hindwing in the male, but with a postdiscal series of large triangular black spots and a terminal connected series of still larger triangular black spots at the apices of veins 2 to 7. Underside: similar to that in the male, the brown transverse strigae and spots are more numerous, the costa of the fore and the <b>median</b> <b>line</b> on the hindwing are very prominently brown. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in the male.|$|E

The antemedial, <b>median,</b> and postmedial <b>lines</b> are dark yellow {{and there is}} a dark discal dot between the antemedial and <b>median</b> <b>lines.</b> The hindwings are similar in colour and markings but lack an antemedial line. There is a dark dashed terminal line on both wings. Adults are on wing from December to September.|$|R
50|$|Russia, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan have {{bilateral}} agreements {{with each other}} based on <b>median</b> <b>lines.</b> Because of their use by the three nations, <b>median</b> <b>lines</b> {{seem to be the}} most likely method of delineating territory in future agreements. However, Iran insists on a single, multilateral agreement between the five nations (as {{this is the only way}} for it to achieve a one-fifth share of the sea). Azerbaijan is at odds with Iran over some oil fields that both states claim. Occasionally, Iranian patrol boats have fired at vessels sent by Azerbaijan for exploration into the disputed region. There are similar tensions between Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan (the latter claims that the former has pumped more oil than agreed from a field, recognized by both parties as shared).|$|R
50|$|According to Slovenia, Savudrija was {{associated}} with Piran (which had an Italian majority at that time) for centuries, and claims that Slovenian police controlled the entire gulf between 1954 and 1991. If this claim prevails, Slovenia could request certain bay parts on the <b>median</b> <b>line's</b> Croatian side. Croatia disputes historical Slovenian control.|$|R
500|$|The mesosoma is [...] {{wide and}} covered in erect setae (on the dorsal surfaces). On the propodeum, the setae are {{slightly}} recurved. The neck is long and one-quarter {{the length of the}} thorax (when excluding the propodeum). V-shaped sulci are present on the dorsomedial portion of the pronotum. The promesonotal suture (a rigid joint between two or more hard elements of an organism) is also well developed and complete. The sulcus is known to demarcate the entirety of the ants' mesoscutum and mesoscutellum. When measured, the scutellum is approximately half the length of the scutum, and the scutellums dorsal surface has a pair of deep, rectangular-shaped foveae that is located nearby the <b>median</b> <b>line.</b> The dorsellum is well developed and has a pair of shallow foveae. The pronotum contains little to no foveae or setae, but it is fully developed. The mesopleuron is separated from the mesosoma by complete sulci, and when viewed dorsally, it bears a series of C-shaped grooves and foveae. The propodeum measures [...] long and sports a slit-like spiracle which faces to the rear; the posterior margin of the propodeum is shelf-like and medically emarginates. The metapleural gland has a large, crescent shaped opening and well developed metapleural bulla. Trochantellus is found on all legs, and they are very well separated from the trochanter (leg part attached rigidly to the femur) and femur on both the meso- and metathoracic legs (the middle and hindmost pair of legs). On the ventral margin, a subapical tooth can be seen on the large claws. The metasoma is mostly obscured by a large bubble. A large stinger appears to be present.|$|E

2500|$|In September 1940 Maffey {{approached}} the Irish External Affairs Secretary, Joseph Walshe, to inform him ‘of the intended increase of light naval craft’ in Lough Foyle. The Royal Navy increased {{its use of}} Lough Foyle {{in the early months}} of 1941. The Royal Navy remained concerned {{that there might be a}} challenge to its use of the Foyle on the grounds that ships navigating the river to Lisahally and Londonderry might be infringing Irish neutrality. If the border followed the <b>median</b> <b>line</b> of Lough Foyle then the channel might be in Irish waters as it [...] "lies near to the Eire shore". In mid-November 1941, legal opinions of solicitors to The Honourable The Irish Society were presented to the Royal Navy. The Hon. The Irish Society's view was that the whole of Lough Foyle was part of County Londonderry and accordingly the border could not be that of the <b>median</b> <b>line</b> of Lough Foyle. The Royal Navy continued to use its new base on the Foyle until 1970.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 70 - 80 mm. Adults {{are similar}} to Xylophanes monzoni but generally paler, with a less diffuse pattern and more falcate forewings. The abdomen has long, pale hair-like scales. The forewing upperside is pale brown-beige from the base to the apex with scattered black scales restricted to the leading edge anterior to the discal spot. The base of the wing has a pale purple suffusion and traces of two <b>median</b> <b>lines</b> running from the inner margin. There is {{a full complement of}} five dark brown postmedian and two submarginal lines, all sharply defined and converging to the apex. It is less contrastingly patterned than Xylophanes monzoni. The hindwing upperside ground colour is pale brown and the median band consists of two thin, straight, dark brown lines. The submarginal band is present and of similar colour and width to the two <b>median</b> <b>lines,</b> but it is distinctly darker than the grey marginal band.|$|R

2500|$|Juvenile onset {{dystonia}} {{is a rare}} {{degenerative disease}} that affects the central nervous system; in particular, it affects areas of the neocortex and thalamus, where rod-like eosinophilic inclusions are formed. The affected individuals represent a phenotype with deformities on the <b>median</b> <b>line,</b> sensory hearing loss and dystonia. It {{is caused by a}} point mutation in which the amino acid tryptophan replaces arginine in position 183.

2500|$|From behind, the {{vertebral}} column presents in the <b>median</b> <b>line</b> the spinous processes. In the cervical region (with {{the exception of}} the second and seventh vertebrae) these are short, horizontal and bifid. In {{the upper part of the}} thoracic region they are directed obliquely downward; in the middle they are almost vertical, and in the lower part they are nearly horizontal. In the lumbar region they are nearly horizontal. The spinous processes are separated by considerable intervals in the lumbar region, by narrower intervals in the neck, and are closely approximated in the middle of the thoracic region. Occasionally one of these processes deviates a little from the <b>median</b> <b>line</b> [...] which can sometimes be indicative of a fracture or a displacement of the spine. On either side of the spinous processes is the vertebral groove formed by the laminae in the cervical and lumbar regions, where it is shallow, and by the laminae and transverse processes in the thoracic region, where it is deep and broad; these grooves lodge the deep muscles of the back. Lateral to the spinous processes are the articular processes, and still more laterally the transverse processes. In the thoracic region, the transverse processes stand backward, on a plane considerably behind that of the same processes in the cervical and lumbar regions. In the cervical region, the transverse processes are placed in front of the articular processes, lateral to the pedicles and between the intervertebral foramina. In the thoracic region they are posterior to the pedicles, intervertebral foramina, and articular processes. In the lumbar region they are in front of the articular processes, but behind the intervertebral foramina.|$|E
