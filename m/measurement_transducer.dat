Pressure distortion caused by frictional attenuation and pneumatic resonance within the sensing system makes obtaining unsteady pressure measurements by conventional sensors difficult.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of zinc-oxide material in 1968 much research has been directed towards the characterisation of the electrical behaviour of the material under various stress conditions. An aim {{of some of these}} investigations is to achieve an equivalent circuit representation, which adequately simulates the observed test results. An adequate equivalent circuit representation will aid the reliable and efficient design of the overvoltage protection and help to improve the optimisation of the protective devices. A significant impediment to the accurate characterisation of zinc oxide has been the lack of reliable test data especially for fast-rate-of-rise impulses in the microsecond and sub-microsecond range.

40|$|Most of {{the current}} Head-Up Display {{solutions}} in the automotive domains can not handle user input. Nevertheless, many automotive manufacturers develop and/or implement gesture interaction systems, controlled by the user's hand, into their head-down infotainment displays. The gesture recognition, precisely the hand tracking, is mostly facilitated with camera systems that monitor the driver or with infrared sensors. These systems require a line of sight between the driver's hands and the <b>measurement</b> <b>transducer.</b> Therefore, they require interior design integration and are visible to the user. Moreover, the permanent camera monitoring of the driver, in combination with an internet connected vehicle, can cause privacy issues and increase the driver's feeling of observation.

40|$|The same {{practical}} precautions {{that apply}} to thermocouples also apply to RTD’s, i. e., use shields and twisted-pair wire, use proper sheathing, avoid stress and steep gradients, use large extension wire, keep good documentation and use a guarded integrating dvm. In addition, the following precautions should be observed. Construction- Due to its construction, the RTD is somewhat more fragile than the thermocouple, and precautions {{must be taken to}} protect it. Self-Heating- Unlike the thermocouple, the RTD is not self-powered. A current must be passed through the device to provide a voltage that can be measured. The current causes Joule (I 2 R) heating within the RTD, changing its temperature. This self-heating appears as a measurement error. Consequently, attention must be paid to the magnitude of the measurement current supplied by the ohmmeter. A typical value for selfheating error is 1 2 ºC per milliwatt in free air. Obviously, an RTD immersed in a thermally conductive medium will distribute its Joule heat to the medium, and the error due to self-heating will be smaller. The same RTD that rises 1 ºC per milliwatt in free air will rise only 1 10 ºC per milliwatt in air which is flowing at the rate of one meter per second. 10 Figure 46 To reduce self-heating errors, use the minimum ohms measurement current that will still give the resolution you require, and use the largest RTD you can that will still give good response time. Obviously, there are compromises to be considered.
