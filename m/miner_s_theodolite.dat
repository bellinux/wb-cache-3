40|$|The simple {{addition}} of a charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera to a theodolite makes it safe to measure the pointing direction of a laser beam. The present {{state of the art}} requires this to be a custom addition because theodolites are manufactured without CCD cameras as standard or even optional equipment. A theodolite is an alignment telescope equipped with mechanisms to measure the azimuth and elevation angles to the sub-arcsecond level. When measuring the angular pointing direction of a Class ll laser with a theodolite, one could place a calculated amount of neutral density (ND) filters in front of the <b>theodolite</b> <b>s</b> telescope. One could then safely view and measure the laser s boresight looking through the <b>theodolite</b> <b>s</b> telescope without great risk to one s eyes. This method for a Class ll visible wavelength laser is not acceptable to even consider tempting for a Class IV laser and not applicable for an infrared (IR) laser. If one chooses insufficient attenuation or forgets to use the filters, then looking at the laser beam through the theodolite could cause instant blindness. The CCD camera is already commercially available. It is a small, inexpensive, blackand- white CCD circuit-board-level camera. An interface adaptor was designed and fabricated to mount the camera onto the eyepiece of the specific <b>theodolite</b> <b>s</b> viewing telescope. Other equipment needed for operation of the camera are power supplies, cables, and a black-and-white television monitor. The picture displayed on the monitor is equivalent to what one would see when looking directly through the theodolite. Again, the additional advantage afforded by a cheap black-and-white CCD camera is that it is sensitive to infrared as well as to visible light. Hence, one can use the camera coupled to a theodolite to measure the pointing of an infrared as well as a visible laser...|$|R

The applied fatigue model is based on established methods and is incorporated in an iterative numerical design tool for realistic wind turbine blades. All aerodynamic and structural design properties are available in literature. The software tool FAST is used for advanced aero-servo-elastic load calculations and stress-histories are calculated with elementary beam theory. According to wind energy design standards, a turbulent wind load case is implemented. Fatigue loads are estimated based on 100 % availability and a site-specific annual wind distribution. Rainflow cycle counting and <b>Miner</b> <b>s</b> sum for cumulative damage prediction is used together with constant life diagrams tailored to actual material S-N data. Material properties are based on 95 % survival probability, 95 % confidence level, and additional material safety factors to maintain conservative results. Fatigue performance is first evaluated for the baseline blade design of the 10 MW NOWITECH reference wind turbine. Results show that blade damage is dominated by tensile stresses due to poorer tensile fatigue characteristics of the shell glass fiber material. The interaction between turbulent wind and gravitational fluctuations is demonstrated to greatly influence the damage. The need for relevant S-N data to closely predict such blade stress cycle events is investigated to avoid non-conservative conclusions. State-of-art wind turbine blade trends are discussed and different designs of the NOWITECH baseline blade are analyzed in a parametric study focusing on fatigue performance and material costs...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} occurrence, behaviour, spatial distribution, and {{temporal}} distribution of cetaceans in the Greater Dyer Island area, Western Cape, South Africa. Three main methods were used in the study: Analysis of data from a local whale-watching vessel (WWV) (2000 2012), visual land-based theodolite tracking (during four southern right whale seasons (August December) from 2011 2014 and one summer/autumn season in 2013), and passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) using a single bottom moored hydrophone (DSG-Ocean Loggerhead) in the months of January/February, September, and October, 2014). Methods were chosen, due to suitability, cost efficiency, and because they complement each other. Data from the WWV covered more than a ten-year period and provided indications of temporal and spatial distribution trends, but data were limited with respect to survey effort and behavioural data. Shore-based observations provided spatial, temporal, and behaviour patterns of the cetacean species in the area, but the method is labour intensive, requires daylight and is restricted by weather conditions. PAM could be conducted 24 hours a day and in poor weather conditions and enabled a temporal extension of the monitoring of cetaceans in the area, but individual hydrophones, are expensive and can break down or be lost. Simultaneous visual observations and PAM were used to investigate the vocalisation patterns of southern right whales and the possibility of using PAM to monitor presence of southern right whales. An analysis of the consistency and validity of the opportunistic data from the WWV was conducted before the data was used in a spatial and temporal analysis. The Consistency Index (CI) was defined as the proportion of times a data field was recorded per total number of trips during all years. The validity of the data were assessed to determine accuracy of the data. The validity and consistency analysis of the sighting records revealed that the dataset was useful but data fields varied considerably in their consistency of collection. The trip duration and route was recorded in less than 5 % of cases, making analysis of temporal and spatial patterns difficult. The validity of species identification was excellent with 100 % agreement between observer records and photographic documentation in 152 encounters of seven cetacean species. Behavioural data were described in overly subjective terms, thus not allowing for any analysis of patterns. The analysis also resulted in a list of suggestions for the design of future observation sheets, and data collection methods and {{the development and implementation of}} worldwide standards are encouraged (guidelines and protocols), which should address different levels and scenarios of data collection from WWV. This work has made a novel contribution to the global research field by submission of a paper and direct communication with the whale watching subcommittee at the International Whaling Commission (IWC) concerning content in the International guidelines for platform of opportunity guiding principles on data collection. An analysis of opportunistic cetacean sightings from the local WWV consisted of more than 5500 cetacean encounters during more than 2500 trips from 2003 to 2012. Results were twofold; 1) discovering that there are five main cetacean species using the area: Southern right whales (Eubalaena australis), humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), Bryde s whales (Balaenoptera brydeii), Indian Ocean humpback dolphins (Sousa plumbea), and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) and providing spatial and temporal distribution patterns for these species as well as the first long-term, year round dataset for this area. Three other species of incidental visitors were: Common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), killer whales (Orcinus orca) and Heaviside s dolphins (Cephalorhynchus heavisidii). 2) Showing that opportunistic data of cetacean encounters collected regularly from a WWV constitute an important source of baseline information of the wildlife abundance and distribution. Caveats and limitations of data from the WWV are discussed and advice regarding data collection from platforms of opportunities are provided. Particularly, the lack of basic data on search effort and of clearly defined behavioural categories is emphasised and standardisation of guidelines for data-collection methods worldwide is suggested. Southern right whales were by far the most frequently occurring cetaceans with a marked seasonal presence from August to December. Numbers peaked consistently between June and January each year and only a single encounter was recorded between 31 January and 26 May in the entire dataset. They appeared either as unaccompanied adults (UAs), as part of surface active groups (SAGs) or as cows accompanied by their calves (cc-pairs). Single right whales were more commonly encountered at the beginning of high season (June September) while groups of two or more were most commonly encountered in the middle of the season (July September) and the modal group size was two. Cow-calf pairs were encountered most frequently late in the season with highest encounters in October December. All right whales were predominantly located close to shore, as were the two main dolphin species. Bryde s whales and humpback whales were located farther from shore. Bryde s whales were observed in all years, except 2006. The highest encounter of Bryde s whales were between March and May. Bryde s whale calves were encountered year round. The highest number of encounters occurred during 2003 (n= 25), dropping to 0 in 2006 and then slowly increased at 1 % per annum after 2006. Humpback whales showed two peaks in seasonality: the majority of animals were encountered in June (last month of low season), July and August, with a much smaller peak in late November and December. Most encounters with humpback whale cow-calf pairs occurred during October December. Humpback whale encounters varied considerably from year to year, with most encounters in 2008 (n= 28), 2011 (n= 15), and 2012 (n= 12), but showed a slow average increase at 0. 4 % per annum. Encounters of Indian Ocean humpback dolphins were more frequent during summer months, and most encounters occurred in 2003 - 2007 and in 2011, a slightly negative annual trend existed (0. 9 %). Calves were mainly encountered occurring in December (n = 25) and January (n = 12). Indo- Pacific bottlenose dolphins showed a clear seasonal peak occurred from December to April and most encounters occurred in 2004 - 2006 and in 2009 with a slightly negative annual trend over time (0. 2 %). Seasonality of calves followed the same pattern of as adults. This study was the first to reveal that there are five cetacean species using the area and provide temporal and spatial patterns based on long term data. Shore-based observations, using a surveyor <b>s</b> <b>theodolite,</b> enabled an analysis of behaviour in addition to confirming the spatial and temporal distributions of cetacean species obtained from the WWV-data. Hourly scans were conducted to provide information on species presence, location, group size, group composition, and surface behaviour. In addition, focal groups that were tracked provided and detailed information on movements and behaviours. Effort totalled 1558 hours and 26 minutes (1204 scans) over 270 days between 24 August 2011 and 11 December 2014. All sighting data were filtered to remove periods of poor weather conditions, only observations collected at sea state ? 2 for dolphin species, and ? 5 for baleen whales were analysed. The area is an important location for nursing and socialising southern right whales and it might be a summer feeding area for Bryde s whales. The primarily observed behaviour of humpback whales was travelling and 80 % of the tracked animals were travelling south-east towards Cape Agulhas. Finally, it was found that the area serves as a year round socialising and resting area for the two dolphin species. Swimming speed was calculated, using the longest focal follow from each day for southern right whales and all focal follow tracks of dolphin species. All southern right whales were found to be swimming at a speed less than 5. 1 km/h. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016. tm 2016 Zoology and EntomologyPhDUnrestricte...|$|R
40|$|A Paradigm Shift As market economists, mine {{managers}} {{are interested in}} "staying in business" and even "prospering. " Bottom-line results are the "order of the day. " Concern for bottom-line results invokes questions such as: How much was produced? At what cost? And, was anyone injured? While these questions will always carry everyday emphasis at the mine, they are fundamentally lacking in that they often appear, especially to lower levels of management and to the production worker, as preeminent concerns. Driven by market economics, many organizations have decentralized, outsourced, downsized, restructured, and formed new coalitions. Investments in new technology and concentration on productivity have been part and parcel with these changes, contributing to improvements in both safety and efficiency. A reason for (and, perhaps a result of) these improvements has been {{the development of a}} highly experienced and flexible work force.

More than 1000 U. <b>S.</b> <b>miners</b> die of lung disease each year (NIOSH, 1999). Mine safety and health professionals have long recognized training as a critical element of an effective safety and health program. Federal regulations (30 CFR, Parts 46 and 48) require mine operators to provide initial safety and health training to all new miners, as well as a minimum of 8 hours of refresher training each year. The time and money being spent to train U. <b>S.</b> <b>miners</b> is substantial, and so there is a strong and steady demand for new and better mine training materials and methods. A growing concern among mine safety professionals regards the training of new workers. A major change in the mining workforce is anticipated within the next decade. In major segments of mining, especially coal, relatively few workers have been hired since the 1970 's. Thus, as an entire cohort of miners in the current workforce nears retirement, the replacement of these employees will require an influx of new workers. New miners may be young people who lack the ability to recognize and respond to mining hazards in an appropriate manner. They may also have had different educational experiences than their older counterparts. Many safety professionals believe that these two cohorts require different approaches to training. The papers in this report should help prepare mine trainers for the changes about to occur in the workforce and acquaint them with strategies they can use to enhance the effectiveness of their training. The first three papers present basic principles for teaching adults. The five remaining papers are intended to illustrate how these principles {{can be applied to the}} development and imple 2 of effective training for miners. Below is an overview of these papers. 1.

Basic aspects of curriculum development are briefly reviewed. For further information about adult learning, see Camm and Cullen's paper. 2.

40|$|Longwall mining {{has gained}} the {{reputation}} {{as being the}} safest extraction method in underground coal mines. However, {{one of the most}} difficult tasks associated with longwall mining is moving the face once a panel is completed. Based on Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) fatality reports since 1996, longwall face recovery operations have claimed the lives of 5 U. <b>S.</b> <b>miners</b> and have resulted in numerous injuries. Recovery operations can be hazardous because they involve moving large pieces of equipment in very confined spaces. They are also conducted in highly stressed ground conditions due to front abutment loads generated by panel extraction. Shield removal is the most hazardous operation during face recovery because miners are constantly exposed to the unpredictable gob edge. To protect the miners, one or more walking shields, cribbing and/or other supplemental roof and standing supports are typically employed as breaker line supports as each shield is removed. At the Harris No. 1 Mine in southern WV, mobile roof supports (MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s) have been used in lieu of traditional walking shields on 17 face moves since 1997. MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s are shield-like support units mounted on crawler tracks and are commonly used during room-and-pillar retreat mining operations. For longwall recovery, the two biggest advantages that MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s have over traditional walking shields are that they are remotely controlled and are highly maneuverable. MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s have contributed to safer shield recovery and shorter move times at the Harris No. 1 Mine. This paper will address both the safety and the operational issues associated with MRS usage during shield recovery. It will also discuss new developments, including the use of the inherently safer battery powered MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s, which have been recently certified by the Mine Safety and Health Administration...|$|R

40|$|This {{publication}} {{provides an}} historical overview of research {{undertaken by the}} U. S. federal government over the last 100 years to improve {{the health and safety}} of our nation 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 <b>s</b> <b>miners.</b> Federal research efforts began with the establishment of the U. S. Bureau of Mines (USBM, or the Bureau) in 1910. They have continued over the past century, even after the Bureau 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s closure in 1996. It is hoped that this publication will give the reader an appreciation for the work of mining health and safety researchers over the past century, and of the miners served by this research. Although not a comprehensive history, this report highlights the key organizational changes made within the Bureau and the federal government that affected mining safety and health research. Some mention is also made of Bureau research not directly related to mining health and safety. Note that the work classified as safety and health research has varied over the last century. For example, before 1970 the Bureau separated mining research and safety and health research. At that time, mining research included ground control and methane drainage because they had direct implications for mine safety. Explosives research was also reported separately from health and safety, even though permissible explosives research was obviously related to safety. Therefore, where budget figures from the Bureau are mentioned in this report, it is often not possible to separate safety and health research from other types of research. This history is generally chronological, with a few exceptions. Because of their prominence and direct links to Bureau research, most of the Public Health Service mining studies completed before 1970, when NIOSH was established, will be discussed in a single section, even though the work spanned many decades. Likewise, for convenience, the brief histories of the Bureau 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s mining research centers are located in one section...|$|R
