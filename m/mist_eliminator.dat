40|$|<b>Mist</b> <b>eliminators</b> (also called droplet eliminators, droplet {{separators}} or demisters) are {{devices that}} can remove liquid droplets from a gas flow. The gas flow laden with droplets {{is forced to}} pass through different channels, changing direction in a repetitive manner. Wave-plate (or vane type) eliminator are widely employed in chemical and industrial processes involving gas and vapour flows where mist removal is necessary for several reasons. For instance, {{one of the most}} important objectives is to restrict pollutant emission into the environment, as in cooling towers applications. Wave-plate <b>mist</b> <b>eliminators</b> can operate in vertical and horizontal situations, but in both cases, the removal of liquid droplets occurs mainly by inertial impaction. In cooling towers, spraying water is distributed over a heat transfer surface across or through which a stream of air is passing. Thus, water droplets can be captured by the stream of air and they will be carried out of the system. This phenomenon is known as drift. In countries with warm climate, inside the cooling towers the conditions of high temperature and humidity can strongly induce the spreading of pathogens agents, especially the Legionella pneumophila. The main disadvantage of installing mist (i. e., drift) eliminators is an increased pressure loss of the airflow. High-pressure loss contributes to lower flow rate of air or higher engine power of the ventilators. This fact leads to obtain lower overall efficiency values for the air-conditioning systems. Since a lack of systematic studies on comparative evaluation of morphologically similar separators has been detected, the behaviour of four wave-type eliminators having a similar geometry is studied. Both droplet collection efficiency and the pressure drop coefficient are calculated. Special emphasis is made on the validation of the numerical model with results taken from the literature, the study of the effects of relevant parameters, and the achievement of a procedure to evaluate the overall efficiency of each regarded type of eliminator. The obtained results may contribute to improve the passive droplets restraint systems in mechanical cooling towers, increasing the overall operation of the cooling tower on one side, and lowering their environmental impact on the other...|$|R

For the range of droplets sizes of interest for demisting operation, the turbulent dispersion model is found to play {{a fundamental role in}} determining the droplet motion. However, classical dispersion models, as the eddy interaction model, often available in commercial CFD codes are unsuited, resulting in errors on the removal efficiency larger than 100 % for the investigated cases. Therefore, a simple procedure for the modification of the code in order to replace the dispersion model with alternative models by using the existing Lagrangian algorithm is proposed. Predictions with a varied eddy interaction model are observed to match closely experimental data on removal efficiencies. An analysis of the turbulence models is also carried out, those for low Re resulting in a better description of the gas flow field and droplet motion. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Among the {{separation}} devices used to remove minute droplets of liquid from a gas stream, wave plate mist eliminators, which {{separate the two}} phases by inertial impaction, are usually adopted in many applications. Re-entrainment limits the gas-liquid separator performance because it causes a sharp decrease in separation efficiency and therefore gas velocity cannot exceed a certain value. This work presents new experimental data for the critical gas velocity at which re-entrainment occurs in industrial wave plate mist eliminators operated at atmospheric conditions with horizontal flow. The results show how the critical gas velocity is influenced by physical properties and flow rate of the liquid and by separator geometry. This paper also presents a new model for predicting re-entrainment based on the calculation of the liquid load on each plate between two consecutive bends of the separator. To this scope, an efficiency model {{was used to evaluate}} liquid flow over each plate and a mechanistic model was developed to compute the re-entrainment from the trickles which are formed on the plates by the coalescence of liquid droplets that impinge on the blades of the wave plate <b>mist</b> <b>eliminator.</b> The model developed takes into account the parameters which influence re-entrainment according to experimental data, it could be used to predict the critical velocity for different wave plate mist eliminators and therefore it is useful to design new ones...|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{issued the}} second phase of the organic air {{emission}} standards for hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs) and hazardous waste generators in December 1994. These standards (referred to as the Subpart CC standards) are designed to further reduce organic air emissions from hazardous waste management activities. To comply with these new air standards, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) is designing a volatile organic removal and destruction treatment train to modify its existing Waste Water Treatment Tank Farm (hereafter called Tank Farm). LLNL`s Tank Farm consists of six, 7, 000 -L open-top tanks used to store and treat aqueous low-level radioactive, mixed, and hazardous waste before discharging it to the local publicly owned treatment works. The waste stored and treated in the tanks have elevated volatile organic constituent (VOC) concentrations. According to the Subpart CC standards, tanks handling waste with similar VOC concentrations must be retrofitted with a cover and an emission control device for cover openings that achieves at least a 95 % reduction in the total organic content of the vented gas stream.

Some adaptations to the alternatives described may be required, depending {{on the extent of}} contact maintenance that can be achieved. This evaluation identified key issues for the off-gas system design. To provide background information, technology reviews were assembled for various classifications of off-gas treatment equipment, including off-gas cooling, particulate control, acid gas control, mist elimination, NO{sub x} reduction, and SO{sub 2 } removal. An order-of-magnitude cost estimate for one of the off-gas systems considered is provided using both the off-gas characteristics associated with the Joule-heated and combustion-fired melters. The key issues identified and a description of the preferred off-gas system options are provided below. Five candidate treatment systems were evaluated.

40|$|In the {{petroleum}} industry, cyclonic separators are acceptable as hydrocyclone, <b>mist</b> <b>eliminators,</b> separator internal device and compact metering package. Weight and small footprint requirements for {{applications such as}} subsea separation, downhole separation, and compact gas monetization systems is driving interest in using cyclonic separator for bulk gas-liquid separation. Unfortunately, the challenge of coping with the effect of unsteady inlet flow behaviour on the separator performance limit it acceptance for bulk gas-liquid separation. Fundamental understanding of the flow behaviour inside the separator under various inlet flow conditions is required {{to deal with the}} challenge. While most published work have addressed flow behaviour in the lower half of cyclonic separator, this thesis concentrated on the upper half. A gas-liquid pipe cyclonic separator was setup at Cranfield University for bulk gas-liquid separation. Large amount of data at the inlet and upper part of the separator were acquired using electrical resistance tomography (ERT), wire meshes sensor (WMS), conductivity hold up probe and pressure transducers. The acquired data were used in analysing flow regimes, upward swirling liquid film (USLF), zero-net liquid flow (ZNLF), liquid holdup and, general separator performance. It was found from analysis of USLF data that a maximum USLF height exists for every constant superficial liquid velocity. A correlation based on dimensionless numbers was proposed for predicting this height. Experimental results on ZNLF showed that a critical ZNLF also exist above which liquid carryover can take place. The liquid holdup for this critical ZNLF was measured under separator operating condition using ERT and a correlation for predicting the liquid holdup was proposed. Four flow regimes were identified as swirling annular, light-mist heavy-mist and churn using visual observations, ERT, WMS and pressure transducer. A flow regime map was proposed based on gas and liquid Froude number. The performance based on the operating envelope for liquid carryover and pressure drop for horizontal and 270 downward inclined tangential inlet was compared. It was concluded that the separation performance was marginally improved by using an inclined tangential inlet. The pressure drop for the inclined inlet was far greater than that of horizontal inlet. Two inlet nozzles with D–shape were used for separation enhancement. The nozzle that reduces the diameter of full pipe bore by 25 % gave slight improvement but also gave the greatest pressure drop.

40|$|The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) {{recently}} received a deposit sample from the Melter Primary Off Gas System (POG) of the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). This sample {{was composed of}} material that had been collected while the quencher was in operation January 27, 2011 through March 31, 2011. DWPF requested, through a technical assistance request, characterization of the melter off-gas deposits by x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and chemical analysis. The purpose of the Melter Off-Gas System {{is to reduce the}} amount of radioactive particles and mercury in the gases vented to the atmosphere. Gases emitted from the melter pass through the primary film cooler, quencher, Off-Gas Condensate Tank (OGCT), Steam Atomized Scrubbers (SAS), a condenser, a high efficiency <b>mist</b> <b>eliminator,</b> and a high efficiency particulate air filter, before being vented to the Process Vessel Vent System. The film coolers cool the gases leaving the melter vapor space from {approx} 750 C to {approx} 375 C, by introducing air and steam to the flow. In the next step, the quencher cools the gas to about 60 C by bringing the condensate from the OGCT in contact with the effluent (Figure 1). Most of the steam in the effluent is then condensed and the melter vapor space pressure is reduced. The purpose of the OGCT is to collect and store the condensate formed during the melter operation. Condensate from the OGCT is circulated to the SAS and atomized with steam. This atomized condensate is mixed with the off-gas to wet and join the particulate which is then removed in the cyclone. The next stage incorporates a chilled water condenser which separates the vapors and elemental mercury from the off-gas steam. Primary off-gas deposit samples from the DWPF melter have previously been analyzed. In 2003, samples from just past the film cooler, from the inlet of the quencher and inside the quencher were analyzed at SRNL. It was determined that the samples were a mixture of sludge and glass frit. The major component was Si along with Fe, Al, and other elements in the radioactive waste being processed. The deposits analyzed also contained U- 235 fission products and actinide elements. Prior to that, deposits in the off-gas system in the DWPF nonradioactive half scale melter and the one-tenth scale integrated DWPF melter system were analyzed and determined to be mixtures of alkali rich chlorides, sulfates, borates, and fluorides entrained with iron oxides, spinels and frit particles formed by vapor-phase transport and condensation. Additional work was performed in 2007 in which researchers similarly found the deposits to be a combination of sludge and frit particles...|$|E
40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) {{converts}} {{the high}} level waste slurries stored at the Savannah River Site into borosilicate glass for long-term storage. The vitrification process results in the generation of approximately five gallons of dilute recycle streams for each gallon of waste slurry vitrified. This dilute recycle stream is currently transferred to the H-area Tank Farm and amounts to approximately 1, 400, 000 gallons of effluent per year. Process changes to incorporate salt waste could {{increase the amount of}} effluent to approximately 2, 900, 000 gallons per year. The recycle consists of two major streams and four smaller streams. The first major recycle stream is condensate from the Chemical Process Cell (CPC), and is collected in the Slurry Mix Evaporator Condensate Tank (SMECT). The second major recycle stream is the melter offgas which is collected in the Off Gas Condensate Tank (OGCT). The four smaller streams are the sample flushes, sump flushes, decon solution, and High Efficiency <b>Mist</b> <b>Eliminator</b> (HEME) dissolution solution. These streams are collected in the Decontamination Waste Treatment Tank (DWTT) or the Recycle Collection Tank (RCT). All recycle streams are currently combined in the RCT and treated with sodium nitrite and sodium hydroxide prior to transfer to the tank farm. Tank Farm space limitations and previous outages in the 2 H Evaporator system due to deposition of sodium alumino-silicates have led to evaluation of alternative methods of dealing with the DWPF recycle. One option identified for processing the recycle was a dedicated evaporator to concentrate the recycle stream to allow the solids to be recycled to the DWPF Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) and the condensate from this evaporation process to be sent and treated in the Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP). In order to meet process objectives, the recycle stream must be concentrated to 1 / 30 th of the feed volume during the evaporation process. The concentrated stream must be pumpable to the DWPF SRAT vessel and should not precipitate solids to avoid fouling the evaporator vessel and heat transfer coils. The evaporation process must not generate excessive foam and must have a high Decontamination Factor (DF) for many species in the evaporator feed to allow the condensate to be transferred to the ETP. An initial scoping study was completed in 2001 to evaluate the feasibility of the evaporator which concluded that the concentration objectives could be met. This initial study was based on initial estimates of recycle concentration and was based solely on OLI modeling of the evaporation process. The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) has completed additional studies using simulated recycle streams and OLI{reg_sign} simulations. Based on this work, the proposed flowsheet for the recycle evaporator was evaluated for feasibility, evaporator design considerations, and impact on the DWPF process. This work was in accordance with guidance from DWPF-E and was performed in accordance with the Technical Task and Quality Assurance Plan...|$|E
