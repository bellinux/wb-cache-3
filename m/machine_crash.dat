50|$|If the stored parity is {{different}} from the parity computed from the stored data, at least one bit must have been changed due to data corruption. Undetected memory errors can have results ranging from undetectable and without consequence, to permanent corruption of stored data or <b>machine</b> <b>crash.</b> In the case of the home PC where data integrity is often perceived to be of little importance—certainly true for, say games and web browsing, less so for Internet banking and home finances—non-parity memory is an affordable option. However, if data integrity is required, parity memory will halt the computer and prevent the corrupt data from affecting results or stored data, although losing intermediate unstored data and preventing use until any faulty RAM is replaced. For the expense of some computational overhead, of negligible impact with modern fast computers, detected errors can be corrected—this is increasingly important on networked machines serving many users.|$|E

40|$|High {{availability}} (HA) {{is critical}} for many stream processing applications such as financial data analysis and disaster response. Existing HA schemes use either active standby or passive standby to guard the system against unexpected failures such as <b>machine</b> <b>crash.</b> Despite previous efforts of simulation-based studies that report active standby is superior, {{there is a lack}} of in-depth understanding of the tradeoff between different HA approaches under practical settings. In this paper, we propose a novel sweeping checkpointing method that can reduce the overhead by one order of magnitude. Whereas most previous work addresses single failures, we prove that the sweeping checkpointing method ensures no loss of data even against multiple concurrent failures. We then implement and compare the resulting passive standby variant against active standby using a real stream processing system. We find that passive standby presents a different tradeoff from active standby: longer recovery time, but 90 % less overhead. Thus each approach has its suitable scenarios...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this {{research}} work, a fault tolerant {{extension of the}} de facto message passing system parallel virtual machine, TS- parallel virtual machine, is introduced. This extension enables real time applications over parallel virtual machine. In PVM and similar message passing systems, if the message receiver is not available, due to network failure or <b>machine</b> <b>crash,</b> a failure is reported and data must be resent. If the transferred data is persistent, i. e. should not be lost, then {{it is important to}} provide the system with failure recovery mechanisms. The idea behind the proposed extension, TS- parallel virtual machine, is to integrate a fault tolerant distributed shared memory layer, in parallel virtual machine. Such layer has been inherited from the TRIPS system that supports fault tolerance over a DSM. The challenge of {{this research}} work is the integration of a DSM layer in a message passing system. The proposed parallel virtual machine extension would have bad performance if compared to the pure message passing one. On the other hand, the real time application can be completed in spite of failures occurrence...|$|E
40|$|Sensors for {{coordinate}} measuring machines (CMM) are nowadays assessed {{within a}} measurement system, i. e. while mounted onto a CMM. This {{means that the}} accuracy or uncertainty of the sensor or probe is not really identified on its own, but {{may be influenced by}} the accuracy or uncertainty of the CMM on which the accuracy testing is done. Determining the accuracy and repeatability of a sensor, apart from the machines uncertainty, could yield useful information in several cases. For instance sensor damage can be ruled out after a <b>machine</b> <b>crash</b> if the sensor could be tested apart from the machines uncertainty. Also testing a new sensor on an older machine sometimes poses a problem, as the sensors inaccuracy can vanish in the total uncertainty of the measuring system due to a high CMM uncertainty. This paper describes the current standardised and accepted methods for evaluating the integration of a CMM sensor in the environment of the machine. Furthermore tests are described to exclude the CMM uncertainty as best as possible to come to an assessment that characterises the sole sensor uncertainty. This is done through smart positioning of the reference tool, using another reference tool in combination with another measurement strategy or using extra equipment to exclude CMM errors. Preliminary results are presented and discussed. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} our ongoing work on efficient recovery of distributed software transactional memory (DSTM) after machine crashes. We {{focus on a}} system model in which transaction objects are replicated on servers, and normally stored in a volatile memory only. On every server, an atomic transaction can locally read and write a set of objects atomically. DSTM systems maintain consistency of object replicas by coordinating object accesses, so that one-copy serializability is guaranteed despite failures such as server crashes. After crash, a server can rejoin the system and {{catch up on the}} current state. Our work is aimed at DSTM systems in which object replication is based on deferred update relying on atomic broadcast. We develop an analytical model of such class of DSTM systems with support of crash recovery using various recovery schemes. The model takes into account multicore concurrency, transaction conflicts, catching up on the current state using object snapshots and a log of transaction operations, and optimizations such as multiversioning. The model formalizes the upper and lower bounds on DSTM operations, and on replica recovery after a <b>machine</b> <b>crash.</b> We used the model to propose various strategies for obtaining object snapshots and catching up on the current state, taking into account transaction processing operations, the length of transactions, the size of objects, and the type of workload. In this paper, we discuss our motivations, goals, and summarize ongoing work. ...|$|E
