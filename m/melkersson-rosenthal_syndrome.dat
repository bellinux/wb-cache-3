We also present a technique for the macrocheilia treatment of lower lip caused by M-R syndrome in a patient with Down syndrome. This patient during pediatric age had many events of facial nerve paralysis and edematous episodes of lower lip with unknown etiology. This technique {{is based on a}} wedge full thickness central excision of the lower lip and on a transversal lozenge excision in the vermilion portion with orbicular muscle to reverse the chin-labial corner. The results are an agreeable aspect of the lip and physiological digestive and phonetic processes. The technique is safe and simple and the aesthetic functional result is very good. In our case, the postoperative complication is caused by an insufficient collaboration of the patient and it is solved in three weeks...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case of}} a 60 -year-old patient with an oligosymptomatic form of <b>Melkersson-Rosenthal</b> syn-drome. This <b>syndrome</b> is characterized by three symptoms: swelling of the lips and face, unilateral facial palsy, and lin-gua plicata. The literature often includes information on monosymptomatic forms of the syndrome and granuloma-tous cheilitis or the existence of only two symptoms of the classic triad. The anamnesis, clinical and histopathological findings in this case confirmed the existence of chronic gran-ulomatous inflammation confined to the lower lip, indicat-ing an oligosymptomatic form of Melkersson-Rosenthal syn-drome. The treatment included prednisone application at a dose of 25 mg daily, histamine H 1 and H 2 antagonists, and the antibiotic ofloxacin for urinary tract infection...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Melkersson-Rosenthal</b> <b>syndrome</b> (also termed [...] "Miescher-Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome"), {{is a rare}} {{neurological}} disorder characterized by recurring facial paralysis, swelling of the face and lips (usually the upper lip - cheilitis granulomatosis) {{and the development of}} folds and furrows in the tongue (fissured tongue). Onset is in childhood or early adolescence. After recurrent attacks (ranging from days to years in between), swelling may persist and increase, eventually becoming permanent. The lip may become hard, cracked, and fissured with a reddish-brown discoloration. The cause of <b>Melkersson-Rosenthal</b> <b>syndrome</b> is unknown, but there may be a genetic predisposition. It has been noted to be especially prevalent among certain ethnic groups in Bolivia. It can be symptomatic of Crohn's disease or sarcoidosis. Approximately 400 cases have been reported worldwide.|$|E
50|$|Fissured {{tongue is}} seen in <b>Melkersson-Rosenthal</b> <b>syndrome</b> (along with facial nerve {{paralysis}} and granulomatous cheilitis). It is also seen in most patients with Down syndrome, in association with geographic tongue, in patients with oral manifestations of psoriasis, and in healthy individuals. Fissured tongue is also sometimes a feature of Cowden's syndrome.|$|E
50|$|There are no {{specific}} laboratory findings {{associated with this}} condition, and the histology tends {{to be similar to}} that seen in rosacea. The differential diagnosis includes acne vulgaris, streptococcal cellulitis, and <b>Melkersson-Rosenthal</b> <b>syndrome,</b> as these conditions can also rarely manifest with a similar edema, as well as other forms of rosacea, lupus erythematosus, and sarcoidosis.|$|E
50|$|The {{enlargement}} of the tissues of the mouth, lips and face seen in OFG is painless. <b>Melkersson-Rosenthal</b> <b>syndrome</b> is where OFG occurs with fissured tongue and paralysis of the facial nerve. The cause of the facial paralysis {{is thought to be}} caused by the formation of granulomas in the facial nerve, which supplies the muscles of facial expression.|$|E
50|$|In {{patients}} {{that have already}} been diagnosed with sarcoidosis, Heerfordt syndrome can be inferred from the major symptoms of the syndrome, which include parotitis, fever, and facial nerve palsy. In cases of parotitis, ultrasound-guided biopsy is used to exclude the possibility of lymphoma. There are many possible causes of facial nerve palsy, including Lyme disease, HIV, <b>Melkersson-Rosenthal</b> <b>syndrome,</b> schwannoma, and Bell's palsy. Heerfordt syndrome exhibits spontaneous remission. Treatments for sarcoidosis include corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs.|$|E
50|$|The middle cranial fossa {{route is}} the only method that can be use to expose the entire I.A.C. and labyrinthine segment with {{preservation}} of hearing. This is combination with the retrolabyrinthine and transmastoid approaches, enables visualization of the entire course {{of the facial nerve}} and still preserves function of the inner ear. The middle cranial foassa technique is most commonly used for the decompression of the facial nerve in Bell's palsy and longitudinal temporal bone fracture. This approach may be useful in the management of patient with schwannomas of cranial nerve 7 and 8, as well as with patient with <b>melkersson-rosenthal</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Some {{systemic}} {{disorders are}} involved in angular cheilitis {{by virtue of their}} association with malabsorption and the creation of nutritional deficiencies described above. Such examples include people with anorexia nervosa. [...] Other disorders may cause lip enlargement (e.g. orofacial granulomatosis), which alters the local anatomy and extenuates the skin folds at the corners of the mouth. More still may be involved because they affect the immune system, allowing normally harmless organisms like Candida to become pathogenic and cause an infection. Xerostomia (dry mouth) is thought to account for about 5% of cases of AC. Xerostomia itself has many possible causes, but commonly the cause may be side effects of medications, or conditions such as Sjögren's syndrome. Conversely, conditions which cause drooling or sialorrhoea (excessive salivation) can cause angular cheilitis by creating a constant wet environment in the corners of the mouth. About 25% of people with Down syndrome appear to have AC. This is due to relative macroglossia, an apparently large tongue in a small mouth, which may constantly stick out of the mouth causing maceration of the corners of the mouth with saliva. Inflammatory bowel diseases (such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) can be associated with angular cheilitis. In Crohn's, it is likely the result of malabsorption and immunosuppressive therapy which gives rise to the sores {{at the corner of the}} mouth. Glucagonomas are rare pancreatic endocrine tumors which secrete glucagon, and cause a syndrome of dermatitis, glucose intolerance, weight loss and anemia. AC is a common feature of glucagonoma syndrome. Infrequently, angular cheilitis may be one of the manifestations of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, and sometimes cases of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis may accompany angular cheilitis. Angular cheilitis may be present in human immunodeficiency virus infection, neutropenia, or diabetes. Angular cheilitis is more common in people with eczema because their skin is more sensitive to irritants. Other conditions possibly associated include plasma cell gingivitis, <b>Melkersson-Rosenthal</b> <b>syndrome,</b> or sideropenic dysphagia (also called Plummer-Vinson syndrome or Paterson-Brown-Kelly syndrome).|$|E
40|$|<b>Melkersson-Rosenthal</b> <b>{{syndrome}}</b> (MRS) {{is a rare}} neuromucocutaneous syndrome {{characterized by}} recurrent facial paralysis, orofacial edema and fissured tongue.

40|$|<b>Melkersson–Rosenthal</b> <b>syndrome</b> as an early manifestation of mixed {{connective}} tissue disease Dorota Jasinska * and Jerzy Boczon Purpose of review: We aim {{to illustrate the}} potential viability of MCTD as an underlying aetiology of Melkersson– Rosenthal syndrome. The case is probably the first description available {{in the literature of}} the Melkersson–Rosenthal as an early manifestation of mixed {{connective tissue}} disease. Recent findings: The <b>Melkersson–Rosenthal</b> <b>syndrome</b> consists of a triad of recurrent lip and/or face swelling, fis-sured tongue, and intermittent facial palsy. Mixed connective tissue disease is a multisystemic disorder with overlap-ping features of systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and polymyositis, and is differentiated from them by a high titer of antibodies to ribonucleoprotein. The paper presents a case report of <b>Melkersson–Rosenthal</b> <b>syndrome</b> with an onset in childhood that derived from vasculitis {{that turned out to be}} an early manifestation of mixed connec-tive tissue disease. We used MRI to evaluate patient’s brain structure and Immunoblot Ena Profil 1 test to test serum autoantibodies level. The patient has a typical for <b>Melkersson–Rosenthal</b> <b>syndrome</b> triad of symptoms: bilateral facial nerve palsy, lingua plicata and facial oedema. Both TC and MRI of the head show no changes as well as laboratory tests except Anti-SS-A (Anti-Ro) and Anti-RNP autoantibody serum level that was highly positive. Summary: Neurological involvement of the MCTD usually includes, according to the frequency of the occurrence, trigeminal neuralgia, headaches, sensorineural hearing, cerebral haemorrhage, transverse myelitis, cauda equina syn-drome, retinal vasculitis, progressive multifocal encephalopathy, and demyelinating neuropathy. For clinical practice it is important to remember that <b>Melkersson–Rosenthal</b> <b>syndrome</b> can also be the neurological manifestation of MCTD, especially when accompanied by other systemic symptoms...|$|E

The patient reported to suffer of hypothyroidism and laboratory findings disclosed free triiodothyronine (FT(3)), free thyroxine (FT(4)), and thyrotropin (TSH) altered. Endocrinological consult led to the diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Antithyroper-oxidase antibodies (anti-TPO) were highly elevated and thyroid function tests had evidenced a clinically significant hypothyroidism.
