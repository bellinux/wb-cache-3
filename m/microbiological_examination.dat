40|$|Maintenance {{of proper}} oral hygiene by dental plaque {{elimination}} {{is one of}} the most important factors affecting the healing process in postoperative oral wounds. Propolis is a substance produced by bees. Ethanolic extract of propolis has bactericidal, fungicidal, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative properties. Moreover, it can scavenge free radicals. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the efficacy of a gel containing 3 % of ethanolic extract of Brazilian green propolis (EEP-B) when used for maintaining oral hygiene in patients with postoperative oral mucosal wounds. The hygiene was assessed using API, OHI, and SBI followed by <b>microbiological</b> <b>examinations.</b> The patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of those who used a gel containing EEP-B for oral hygiene, and group 2 consisted of those who used a gel without EEP-B.

40|$|Introduction : An acute {{infection}} of the nail fold, called paronychia, is a common clinical problem. The basis {{for the implementation of}} the treatment is the result of <b>microbiological</b> <b>examination.</b> Due to the rapid and painful course of infection, usually an empirical antimicrobial treatment prior to obtaining microbiological test results is introduced. Aim: The microbial analysis of acute infections of the nail fold. Material and methods: The study included 32 tests conducted on 31 patients of the Department of Dermatology. Microbiological analysis was performed {{with the use of the}} so-called bait thread test. Results : In 73 % of analyzed cases <b>microbiological</b> <b>examination</b> revealed mixed microbiological flora. Most cultured microorganisms were: Enterococcus faecalis (14 %), Staphylococcus aureus (12 %), Candida albicans (9 %), Enterobacter cloacae (8 %), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7 %). Most cultured bacteria belonged to the families or genera of Enterobacteriaceae (36 %), other cultured bacteria were staphylococci (26 %), enterococci (16 %), Candida species (14 %), and Gram-negative non-fermenting bacilli (8 %). Conclusions : The acute {{infection of}} the nail fold in the vast majority of cases is caused by mixed bacterial flora. A profile of isolated microorganisms suggests that the cause of the infection can be associated with neglect of hygiene. Fluoroquinolone and fusidic acid are recommended as the empirical therapy. <b>Microbiological</b> <b>examination</b> is the basis for the appropriate final treatment...|$|E

Each participant underwent clinical and <b>microbiological</b> <b>examinations</b> for the diagnosis of vaginal infections such as bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and trichomoniasis. In addition, Gram's stained high-vaginal smears were evaluated for the presence of partial BV and vaginitis. Diagnostic accuracies of clinical diagnosis for the aforementioned infections was determined in comparison with gold standard microbiological diagnosis. Proportion of women with vulvovaginal infections were estimated using descriptive statistics and incidence risk ratio for preterm delivery with each form of the infection was estimated using univariate analysis. A total of 790 pregnant women were recruited in the study. Positive predictive values of clinical diagnosis for BV, VVC and Trichomoniasis in comparison with reference method were 72. 7, 33. 5 and 37. 6 % respectively. Partial BV (3. 2 %) and vaginitis due to mixed bacterial etiology (9. 4 %) were per exclusionem diagnosed using the <b>microbiological</b> smear <b>examination.</b> <b>Microbiological</b> diagnosis of BV and vaginitis were found to have a statistically significant association with preterm delivery.

40|$|Background: Bile {{analysis}} yields {{important information}} such as "biliary microlithiasis" and biliary tract colonization by microorganisms like Salmonella typhi or paratyphi, Escherichia coli, etc., which may progresses to cholelithiasis and {{have been found to}} have a {{role in the development of}} gallbladder cancer in India. Aim: To perform microscopic, cytomorphological and <b>microbiological</b> <b>examination</b> of bile collected during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in patients with benign and malignant lesions of the gallbladder. Materials and Methods: Bile was collected from 48 patients by a catheter inserted through the cystic duct during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Direct microscopy and grading of crystals was performed. Smears prepared from centrifuged deposits were stained with Giemsa, Papanicolaou stain and Gram&#x 2032;s stain for cytological and <b>microbiological</b> <b>examination.</b> Special staining for Helicobacter pylori was performed using Loeffler&#x 2032;s Methylene blue and Warthin Starry stain. The rest of the sample was used for culture and complete <b>microbiological</b> <b>examination.</b> Results: Thirty-six patients had inflammatory lesions while 12 had malignant lesions. Crystals were observed in 93 &#x 0025; of the cases, 13 (28. 8 &#x 0025;) had only cholesterol crystals, three (6. 6 &#x 0025;) had bilirubinate and 29 (64. 4 &#x 0025;) had both cholesterol and bilirubinate crystals. Smears from the centrifuged deposit mainly showed coccoid or cocobacillary bacteria on Gram&#x 2032;s staining (81. 3 &#x 0025;). Five of 12 (41. 6 &#x 0025;) malignant cases showed epithelial atypia while none of the benign or inflammatory lesions showed such a change in hematoxylin and eosin and Pap-stained smears. Microbiologic analysis showed Staphylococcus aureus (14 &#x 0025;), S. saprophyticus (5. 5 &#x 0025;), Peptococcus (5. 5 &#x 0025;), Peptostreptococcus (5. 5 &#x 0025;), Proteus mirabilis (5. 5 &#x 0025;), E. coli (17 &#x 0025;), Enteorbacter cloacae (5. 5 &#x 0025;) and H. pylori (2. 8 &#x 0025;).

These samples included 18 surface-water samples, 37 well-water samples, and 8 drinking-water samples, which were examined for microbiology and physical-chemical properties. The <b>microbiological</b> <b>examinations</b> focused on enteric bacteria, which were isolated by culture method, while physical-chemical properties comprised on-site testing for pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), conductivity and total dissolved solids (TDS) by portable electrochemical meter (Sens Ion 156).
