40|$|Despite {{governmental}} {{constraints and}} legislation, the fuel consumption in traffic and transporta-tion increases persistently. To help solving this severe problem, TUE, Van Doorne’s Transmissie (VDT) and TNO started the EcoDrive project to develope a hybrid driveline {{by using a}} high or medium speed flywheel, engine, continuously variable transmission and control strategy. This hybrid driveline and the control strategy decreases the fuel consumption (0 - 20 %) without detori-ating the driveability. To realise a good control strategy, the produced engine output torque (A&) has to be estimated on-line. To estimate this torque the Mean Value Engine Model is applied. This model describes the transfers between input (e. g. the crankshaft angular speed (w,) and throttlevalve angle (4) and the output (e. g. Md and fuel <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>Q</b> f c). It is derived from basic physical and thermodynamic principles and seeks to predict the mean values of engine variables (qv (volumetric effinciency), p, (exhaust manifold pressure) or A&). The structure of the model is modular and can easily be adapted to other engines. In the past, mean value models were used to generate engine maps, {{but most of the}} time the maps are already provided by the manufacturer. The object of this research will be to start from the engine map and go in the opposite direction, trying to estimate the unknown model parameters and engine variables. And if it’s possible, to reduce the number of experiments. For estimating the model parameters and engine variables only the engine output torque Md, engine speed wc, fuel consumtion Qfc, the position 4 of the throttle valve and intake manifold pressure p, have to be known. Under the assumption that the combustion proces is stoichiomet-ric and that the intake manifoId temperature T, is constant, the estimate problem is well defined. ...|$|E
40|$|While {{operating}} at low airspeeds with nominal static margins, the controls on a blended-wing-body aircraft begin to saturate, and the dynamic performance gets sluggish. Augmentation of aerodynamic controls with the propulsion system is therefore considered in this research. Two aspects were of interest: namely, thrust vectoring and flap blowing. An aerodynamic {{model for a}} large blended-wing-body transport aircraft with blown flap effects was formulated using empirical and vortex lattice methods and then integrated with a Trent 500 turbofan engine model. To enhance control effectiveness, both internally and externally blown flaps were simulated. For a full-span internally blown flap arrangement using intermediate compressor flow, the amount of engine bleed and the resulting blowing coefficients were limited. However, even with a reduced bleed mass flow, the pitch control effectiveness increases by 15. 9 % at 85 % fan revolutions per minute. For an externally blown flap arrangement using bypass air, much higher blowing coefficients can be achieved. For instance, at 100 % fan revolutions per minute, there is a 44 % increase in pitch control authority at low dynamic pressures. The main benefit occurs during takeoff, where both thrust vectoring and flap blowing help in achieving early pitch rotation, reducing takeoff field length and liftoff speed considerably. With central flap blowing and a limited thrust vectoring of 10, the liftoff range reduces by 48 %, and liftoff speed reduces by almost 26 %.

40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} {{increasing}} the elevation of an IHX (intermediate heat exchanger) on the transient performance of the KALIMER- 600 reactor pool during the early phase of a loss of normal heat sink accident was investigated. Three reactors equipped with IHXs that were elevated to different heights were designed, and the thermal-hydraulic analyses were carried out for the steady and transient state by using the COMMIX- 1 AR/P code. In order to analyze {{the effects of the}} elevation of an IHX between reactors, various thermal-hydraulic properties such as <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rate, core peak temperature, RmfQ (ratio of <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> over <b>Q)</b> and initiation time of decay heat removal via DHX (decay heat exchanger) were evaluated.

30|$|In contrast, the {{porosity}} in the subsurface {{region is}} sensitive to θ (Fig. 2 (b)). This indicates {{that the increase in}} the <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rate {{plays a major role in}} explaining the high porosity in the subsurface region estimated for SHV (0.5 ∓ 0.7). Considering again the permeability-porosity relationship, the increase in <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rate results in a decrease in θ (see Eq. (12)), which in turn leads to an increase in subsurface porosity (see Fig. 2 (b)). For the possible ranges of ε and θ in Fig. 2 (b), the porosity Φ is larger than 0.5 when θ is smaller than about 1. In the case of k ∼ 10 - 12 m 2 (the value for SHV when Φ = 0.5 – 0.7; Melnik and Sparks, 2002), the <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rate <b>q</b> must exceed 5 kg m- 2 s- 1 for θ< 1. (e.g., compare Fig. 3 (a–c) with Fig. 3 (d–f)). This estimation is consistent with the observation that q at the pre-explosion state of the 1997 events in SHV reached about 28 kg m- 2 s- 1 (Sparks et al., 1998). We suggest that the high flow rate immediately prior to the explosive activity induced the increase in the subsurface porosity.|$|R

The variations of physical quantities such as Φ, ul, ug and P with depth throughout the conduit and the value of the <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rate <b>q</b> are obtained such that {{the boundary}} conditions are satisfied. On the other hand, Eq. (10) provides an algebraic expression of Φ for a given ε, θ, and P. This formula cannot determine the value of q as DE- 2 BV does, but determines the relationships among Φ, µ, and k at a given pressure when the value of q is somehow known. Because Eq. (10) is valid for general forms of µ and k, it is useful for studying how Φ varies as µ and k change with depth in a complex way. In this section, we demonstrate that Eq.

40|$|The {{refrigeration}} of beef carcasses is {{an important}} user of energy. Due to the carcass's complicated shape and composition, {{it is difficult to}} calculate the rate of heat release as it evolves with time during the cooling process. A method has therefore been devised to measure the latent, sensible and radiative heat loads from beef sides. The latent heat load is measured within 3 % error by suspending the beef side on a load cell measuring to ± 0. 15 ppm. The sensible and radiative heat load is measured within 5 % error using a flow-calorimeter type movable wind tunnel constructed to hold one beef side. Due to the small magnitudes of the weight losses, relatively large fluctuations in the weight loss curve occurred and it was necessary to smooth the curve by curve-fitting a three-parameter equation, using an evolutionary algorithm. Typical results are shown. These results are much more precise than results obtained earlier with compensatory heating methods.

The <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensors used in mineral processing plants are designed to monitor the production volumes of the end products. Belt scale {{is the most common}} online bulk material <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensor used in the mineral processing. The belt scale provides an accurate online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> measurement from the process. However, the high unit price of the sensor prevents the installation of multiple belt scales in a single mineral processing plant. In addition to the online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> measurements of the belt scales, offline <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> measurements might be also carried out at the plants. Offline <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensors include wheel loader scales and truck scales. The high unit price, low measurement frequency and variable measurement delays prevent the offline <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensors to be used in automated process control. The main goals of this work are determined by the three research questions formulated for this work. The first goal is to analyse the correlations of four measurement signals of the online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensors against the reference <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> measurement of the belt scale. The fitting of the measurement signals is performed by linear regression method. The analysis of the signals is performed by measures of fit methods, the root mean square RMSE and correlation analysis method R-squared. The second goal is to analyse the accuracies of three <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> estimation models. The third goal is to perform comprehensive analysis of the features, benefits and restrictions of each online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensor. This analysis can be utilized, if the presented online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensors are implemented in a mineral processing plant. The online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensors used in this work are a power transducer, laser profilometer, ultrasonic sensor and strain gauge. In order to answer the research questions, an experimental measurement setup was designed and installed at the test plant. An aggregate production plant is used as an example of mineral processing application in this work. The presented online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensors can also be applied to other mineral processing applications handling solid materials on belt conveyors.
