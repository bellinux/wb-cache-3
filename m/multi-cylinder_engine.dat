5000|$|While many {{items on}} the above {{category}} list are not inherent to a configuration of a <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engine,</b> it is safe for a meaningful discussion of inherent balance on <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> configurations to include at least the balances on: ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Multi-cylinder</b> <b>engine,</b> with {{individual}} coils for each cylinder ...|$|E
5000|$|In a <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engine,</b> a {{crankpin}} {{can serve}} one or many cylinders, for example: ...|$|E

50|$|The {{low tension}} coil system {{was also used}} for <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engines,</b> {{although}} rarely, as it required a separate coil for each cylinder.|$|R
50|$|Engine {{configuration}}: Engine configuration can {{be influenced}} by port design. This is primarily a factor in <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engines.</b> Engine width can be excessive for even two cylinder engines of certain designs. Rotary disk valve engines with wide sweeping transfers can be so wide as to be impractical as a parallel twin. The V-twin and fore-and-aft engine designs are used to control overall width.|$|R
5000|$|In a <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engine,</b> pistons {{may reach}} {{top dead centre}} {{simultaneously}} or at different times depending on the engine configuration. For example: ...|$|E
50|$|Components {{such as the}} {{crankshaft}} of a single-cylinder engine have to {{be nearly}} as strong as that in a <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> of the same capacity per cylinder, meaning that some parts are effectively four times heavier than {{they need to be}} for the total displacement of the engine. The single-cylinder engine will almost inevitably develop a lower power-to-weight ratio than a <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> of similar technology. This can be a disadvantage in mobile operations, although it is of little significance in others and in most stationary applications.|$|E
5000|$|... 17. Phase balance - e.g. If {{only one}} {{cylinder}} of a <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> has a restrictive exhaust port, this condition results in increased resistance every 720 degrees on crank rotation on a 4 cycle engine.|$|E
50|$|At the 1900 'Salon de l'Auto' in Paris Aster {{exhibited}} a motor quadricycle equipped {{with their own}} 3.5 HP, single cylinder engine. <b>Engine</b> sizes and <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engines</b> were progressively developed.|$|R
5000|$|... 14. Plane balance - Torque {{is applied}} to the {{crankshaft}} on the crank rotational plane where the connecting rod is located, which are at different distances to the power take off (clutch surface) plane on non-radial <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The B190, which {{replaced}} the highly successful B189, utilized the Ford HBA4 V8 engine. As Ford's official team in F1, Benetton {{were given the}} latest engine while customer teams had {{to make do with}} the older Ford DFR which Benetton had first used in [...] Through the season, Piquet and Alessandro Nannini successfully kept the B190 apace with other front runners including the V10 McLaren-Honda's and Williams-Renault's, and Ferrari's V12 with its Semi-automatic transmission, despite the power advantage the <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engines</b> had over the Ford V8. Indeed, at some races the Ford powered Benetton's were as fast in a straight line as the more powerful <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engines,</b> the lower weight of the V8 allowing the team to use less downforce which also reduced tyre wear.|$|R
5000|$|... 11. Amount {{of torque}} - Normally, {{the amount of}} torque {{generated}} by each cylinder {{is supposed to be}} uniform within a <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engine.</b> Often, however, there are small but measurable differences. This irregularity creates torque imbalance in phase and plane.|$|E
50|$|The Field-Marshall and its Track Marshall tracked stable-mate (Marshall-engined Fowler VF and VFA), were {{distinctive}} {{because of}} the use of a single-cylinder two-stroke diesel engine (of about 6-litre capacity) coupled to a very large flywheel, whereas tractors such as the Fordson N used a <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engine.</b> This single-cylinder design was quite common in Europe at the time, the Lanz Bulldog being another example. The Lanz, though, used a hot bulb engine.|$|E
5000|$|The {{son of a}} Strasbourg hotelier, Matthis {{was born}} in Strasbourg, {{which at the time}} was in Germany. Between 1902 and 1904, he worked for the car firm Lorraine-Dietrich, with Ettore Bugatti. In 1904, Mathis and Bugatti {{designed}} the Hermes car, which for some reason was known as the [...] "Burlington" [...] when sold in England. Mathis founded his own car company in 1910 and the following year was a protagonist of the small, <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engine,</b> probably inspired by Bugatti.|$|E
50|$|Single-cylinder engines {{require more}} {{flywheel}} than <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engines,</b> and the rotating mass is relatively large, restricting acceleration and sharp changes of speed. In the basic arrangement they {{are prone to}} vibration - though {{in some cases it}} may be possible to control this with balance shafts.|$|R
50|$|Variable {{displacement}} is {{an automobile}} engine technology {{that allows the}} engine displacement to change, usually by deactivating cylinders, for improved fuel economy. The technology is primarily used in large, <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engines.</b> Many automobile manufacturers have adopted this technology as of 2005, although the concept has existed for some time prior to this.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:This article {{introduces}} {{the development of}} domestic and foreign small power <b>multi-cylinder</b> diesel <b>engines</b> which are below 37 kW. It analyzes the structural characteristics of foreign products and clarifies the status of domestic small power <b>multi-cylinder</b> diesel <b>engines</b> {{as well as the}} causes which limit their development. It also points out that with the tightening of the emission regulations of non-road diesel engines, We need to develop high-performance small power <b>multi-cylinder</b> diesel <b>engines</b> which are compact, energy saving and environmental friendly to meet market demands at home and abroad. Based on the status quo of the domestic industry, it illustrates the development problems of small power <b>multi-cylinder</b> diesel <b>engines</b> that deserve our attention and the corresponding technical countermeasures, and provides recommendations {{on the development of the}} domestic industry. The small power <b>multi-cylinder</b> diesel <b>engine</b> is supporting power for mobile and fixed devices such as low-speed car, small and medium-sized tractors, small and medium-sized combine harvester, small and medium-sized engineering machinery, power generation and water pumps. The 4 -cylinder engines in China,which have bores larger than 85 mm are the basic model that enjoy faste...|$|R
50|$|The Shay, Climax and Heisler locomotives, all {{introduced}} in the late 19th century, used quill drives to couple power from a centrally mounted <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> {{to each of the}} trucks supporting the engine. On each of these geared steam locomotives, one end of each drive shaft was coupled to the driven truck through a universal joint while the other end was powered by the crankshaft, transmission or another truck through a second universal joint. A quill drive also has the ability to slide lengthways, effectively varying its length. This is required to allow the bogies to rotate when passing a curve.|$|E
50|$|Under part {{throttle}} conditions (i.e. when the throttle {{is less than}} fully open), the effective compression ratio is less than when the engine is operating at full throttle, due to {{the simple fact that}} the incoming fuel-air mixture is being restricted and cannot fill the chamber to full atmospheric pressure. The engine efficiency is less than when the engine is operating at full throttle. One solution to this fact is to shift the load in a <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> from some of the cylinders (by deactivating them) to the remaining cylinders so that they may operate under higher individual loads and with correspondingly higher effective compression ratios. This technique is known as variable displacement.|$|E
50|$|Peak {{power of}} a {{traction}} engine occurs at a rotational speed higher than the speed when torque is maximised and at or below the maximum rated rotational speed - Max RPM. A rapidly falling torque curve would correspond with sharp torque and power curve peaks around their maxima at similar rotational speed, for example a small, lightweight engine with a large turbocharger. A slowly falling or near flat torque curve would correspond with a slowly rising power curve up to a maximum at a rotational speed close to Max RPM, for example a large, heavy <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> suitable for cargo/hauling. A falling torque curve could correspond with a near flat power curve across rotational speeds for smooth handling at different vehicle speeds.|$|E
50|$|V engines (V6, V8, etc.) {{usually have}} two rocker covers, {{one for each}} bank of cylinders, while {{straight}} engines (I4, I6, etc.) and single-cylinder engines usually have one rocker cover. Very large <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engines,</b> such as those used in a ship or in aviation, may have one rocker cover for each cylinder, to make removal and installation more manageable.|$|R

This {{compared to}} [...] for the Honda V10, [...] for the Ferrari V12 and [...] for the Renault V10 (the old Ford DFR engine was rated at only [...] ). What the HBA4 lacked in {{power to the}} <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engines</b> was generally made up by being smaller and lighter than its main competitors.|$|R
40|$|A balanced-diaphragm {{device for}} {{measuring}} dynamometer torque of single-cylinder or <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engines</b> is described. This device, which {{was developed for}} laboratory use, {{has proved to be}} accurate, reliable, and adaptable.

50|$|A {{big bang}} engine is an {{unconventional}} motorcycle engine {{designed so that}} most of the power strokes occur simultaneously or in close succession. This is achieved by changing the ignition timing, changing or re-timing the camshaft, and sometimes in combination with a change in crankpin angle. The goal is to change the power delivery characteristics of the engine. A regular firing <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> fires at approximately even intervals, giving a smooth-running engine. Because of a big bang engine's power delivery imbalance, there exists more vibration and stress in the engine. Thus, the power peaks are very strong and can overwhelm the rear tire (if used in a motorcycle), but when the rear tire does slide, the temporary lull in power between power strokes generally makes the slide easier to catch.|$|E
50|$|For multiple-cylinder {{steam engine}}s, see Compound steam engine and Triple-expansion steam engineA <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> is a {{reciprocating}} {{internal combustion engine}} with multiple cylinders. It can be either a 2-stroke or 4-stroke engine, and can be either Diesel or spark-ignition. The cylinders and the crankshaft which is driven by and co-ordinates {{the motion of the}} pistons can be configured {{in a wide variety of}} ways. Multi-cylinder engines offer a number of advantages over single-cylinder engines, chiefly with their ability to neutralize imbalances by having corresponding mechanisms moving in opposing directions during the operation of the engine. A multiple-cylinder engine is also capable of delivering higher revolutions per minute (RPM) than a single-cylinder engine of equal displacement, because the stroke of the pistons is reduced, decreasing the distance necessary for a piston to travel back and forth per each rotation of the crankshaft, and thus limiting the piston speed for a given RPM. Typically, the more cylinders an engine has, the higher the RPM's it can attain for a given displacement and technology level, at a cost of increased friction losses and complexity. Peak torque is also reduced, but the total horsepower is increased due to the higher RPM's attained.|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of automotive exhaust muffler systems {{has been studied}} using an acoustical model based on electrical analogue. The various types of performance descriptions studied are transmission loss, noise reduction, insertion loss and radiated sound pressure level for both without and with a mean flow. The prediction schemes developed are verified on both a model exhaust system and a <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> exhaust system. ^ Among the studies conducted on the model exhaust system, transmission loss and noise reduction are predicted and measured using both the standing wave technique and the random excitation technique. The source impedance of an electro-acoustic driver was measured using the two microphone random excitation technique. Insertion loss and radiated sound pressure level were predicted by using the (measured) source impedance and compared with experimental results for various model exhaust system configurations. It was observed that provided the measured source impedance is used, the performance can be predicted quite well. ^ The investigations on the <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> exhaust system included measurement of source impedance, prediction of insertion loss and radiated sound pressure level. The engine impedance was measured using a transfer function (random excitation) technique. It was observed that speed and load {{did not have any}} significant effect on the impedance measured. Insertion loss and radiated sound pressure level were predicted and measured for various operating conditions of the engine. Both mean flow and temperature gradient effects were included in the development of prediction schemes. Also, four-pole parameters for a straight pipe element {{in the presence of a}} mean flow and a linear temperature gradient have been evaluated. ^ The main observations from the studies on the <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> tested are that the measured engine impedance tends towards the characteristic impedance of the fluid medium for all the operating conditions considered. However, the assumption that the engine impedance is zero or infinity gives poor predictions. The argument between predicted and measured acoustic performance is good, provided that both mean flow and temperature gradient effects are included in analysis. ...|$|E
50|$|Another type of octane rating, called Observed Road Octane Number (RdON), {{is derived}} from testing gasolines in real world <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engines,</b> {{normally}} at wide open throttle. It {{was developed in the}} 1920s and is still reliable today. The original testing was done in cars on the road but as technology developed the testing was moved to chassis dynamometers with environmental controls to improve consistency.|$|R
50|$|The {{firing order}} is the {{sequence}} of power delivery of each cylinder in a <b>multi-cylinder</b> reciprocating <b>engine.</b>|$|R
50|$|Passengers were {{therefore}} in almost {{direct contact with}} the firmly mounted engine. Where the market permitted some isolation was provided by luxuriously sprung passenger-seating often topped with inflated pneumatic cushions. For the luxury market it further encouraged the development of inherently smoother <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engines</b> in place of sixes and eights and, too late for Weymann, the introduction of flexible engine mounts and better chassis suspension systems in place of primitive leaf springs.|$|R
40|$|A {{unit pump}} system was {{installed}} on the single cylinder engine. The performance entitlement of the high-pressure common rail system at notch 4 and notch 8 was determined, and data was also compared with a production design <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engine.</b> Vibration testing of a hybrid-bus-design battery revealed extensive insulation wear. The vendor initiated design activities to address vibration. A cell-level test program was initiated to study battery current flow at room temperature and develop limits. The robustness and sub-optimal simplified implementation of fuel optimization algorithms was studied...|$|E
40|$|A {{homogeneous}} charge {{compression ignition}} (HCCI) engine requires closed-loop control of combustion phasing for reliable operation. Variable valve actuation (VVA) {{has previously been}} shown to enable cycle-to-cycle, cylinder-individual control with high precision, but suffers from a narrow operating range. Adding variable exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) to the closed-loop control structure can extend the operating range. A mid-ranging control structure is presented here for combined VVA and EGR actuations in a <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engine.</b> The control structure is simple to implement and preserves the fast, cylinderindividual, and precise actuation of the VVA system while extending the operating range. Experimental results verify {{the performance of the}} control structure...|$|E
40|$|ME 450 Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Winter 2007 U of M is spearheading {{research}} in Low Temperature Combustion (LTC) /Premixed Compression Ignition (PCI), {{a form of}} diesel combustion that achieves high fuel efficiency with decreased NOx and soot emission but increased hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. A Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) is therefore required. This project involves adding a test rig to the current single cylinder engine to allow researchers to quickly test catalyst bricks suitable for LTC/PCI. The rig should be capable of controlling the exhaust gas temperature entering the catalyst so as to simulate the temperature profile from a <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> for useful results. This rig will be vital for future testing involving biofuels...|$|E
50|$|Experimental engines {{have been}} made and tested that have no camshaft, but have full {{electronic}} control of the intake and exhaust valve opening, valve closing and area of the valve opening. Such engines can be started and run without a starter motor for certain <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engines</b> equipped with precision timed electronic ignition and fuel injection. Such a static-start engine would provide the efficiency and pollution-reduction improvements of a mild hybrid-electric drive, but without the expense and complexity of an oversized starter motor.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of highly {{supercharged}} or high compression <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engines,</b> particularly ones that use methanol (or other fuels prone to pre-ignition), pre-ignition can quickly melt or burn pistons since the power generated by other still functioning pistons will force the overheated ones along no matter how early the mix pre-ignites. Many engines have suffered such failure where improper fuel delivery is present. Often one injector may clog while the others carry on normally allowing mild detonation in one cylinder that leads to serious detonation, then pre-ignition.|$|R
50|$|Earlier diesel pumps used an in-line layout with {{a series}} of {{cam-operated}} injection cylinders in a line, rather like a miniature inline engine. The pistons have a constant stroke volume, and injection volume (i.e., throttling) is controlled by rotating the cylinders against a cut-off port that aligns with a helical slot in the cylinder. When all the cylinders are rotated at once, they simultaneously vary their injection volume to produce more or less power from the engine. Inline pumps still find favour on large <b>multi-cylinder</b> <b>engines</b> such as those on trucks, construction plant, static engines and agricultural vehicles.|$|R
