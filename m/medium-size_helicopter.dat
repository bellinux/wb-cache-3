50|$|The ship is 90 m {{long with}} a {{displacement}} of 1,300 tonnes. She carries twin diesel engines with a distance adjustable tail rotor which can provide enough power for her {{top speed of}} more than 25 kn. She has two power stations, forward and rear, and electricity supply works {{with one of the}} power station sunk. Compared to the traditional round bilge boat, the ship is designed with V type, having angle bending line at the bottom so that she can sail with high speed in rough sea states. However, the ship does not carry any type of sonar so she has no anti-submarine warfare capability. As a result, she will act as a surface warfare corvette only. BNS Shadhinota has a helicopter deck aft which can support a <b>medium-size</b> <b>helicopter,</b> but she has no hangar.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on an {{assessment}} of the state-of-the-art of operational modal analysis (OMA) methodologies in estimating modal parameters from output responses on helicopter structures. For this purpose, a ground vibration test was performed on a real helicopter airframe. In the following stages, several OMA techniques were applied to the measured data and compared with the results from typical input-output approach. The results presented are part of a more general research activity carried out in the Group of Aeronautical Research and Technology in Europe (GARTEUR) Action Group 19, helicopter technical activity, whose overall objective is the improvement of the structural dynamic finite element models using in-flight test data. The structure considered is a <b>medium-size</b> <b>helicopter,</b> a time-expired Lynx Mk 7 (XZ 649) airframe. In order to have a comprehensive analysis, the behaviour of both frequency- and time-domain-based OMA techniques are considered for the modal parameter estimates. An accuracy index and the reliability of the OMA methods with respect to the standard EMA procedures, together with the evaluation of the influence of the experimental setup on the estimate of the modal parameters, will be presented in the paper.

40|$|Research {{activity}} and results obtained within the European project ARISTOTEL (2010 - 2013) are presented. It deals with anatomy, modelling and prediction of Rotorcraft Pilot Coupling (RPC) phenomena, {{which are a}} really broad and wide category of events, ranging from discomfort to catastrophic crash. The main top- ics concerning piloted helicopter simulation that are of interest for designers are examined. These include comprehensive rotorcraft modelling suited for Pilot Assisted Oscillations (PAO) prediction, modelling of pilot biodynamics behaviour in the PAO frequency range of interest, definition and application of criteria for detec- tion of RPC instabilities of aeroservoelastic nature. The numerical investigation considers Bo 105 and IAR 330 Puma helicopter models, as representatives of two different rotorcraft categories (small-size and <b>medium-size</b> <b>helicopters,</b> respectively). Factors affecting aeroservoelastic RPC prediction are investigated (like, for instance, pilot modelling, system modelling, number of controls on which the pilot exerts forces, control chain gearing ratios), {{with the aim of}} defining design guidelines for prevention of adverse RPCs occurrence...|$|R

25|$|The Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma (now Airbus Helicopters H215) is a four-bladed, twin-engine, <b>medium-size</b> utility <b>helicopter</b> {{developed}} and marketed originally by Aérospatiale, later by Eurocopter and currently by Airbus Helicopters. It is an enlarged and re-engined {{version of the}} original Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma. First flying in 1978, the Super Puma succeeded the SA 330 Puma as the main production model of the type in 1980. Since 1990, Super Pumas in military service have been marketed under the AS532 Cougar designation. In civilian service, a next generation successor to the AS 332 was introduced in 2004, the further-enlarged Eurocopter EC225 Super Puma.|$|R
40|$|Flight {{tests have}} been {{conducted}} with a <b>medium-size</b> single-rotor <b>helicopter,</b> one blade of which was equipped with strain gages, to deter-mine the effects of retreating-blade stall on the rotor blade bending and torsional moments during high-speed flight and pull-up maneuvers. The results indicate that retreating-blade stall has a substantial effect on the periodic rotor blade moments. In the stalled condition, the higher harmonics can become almost as large numerically and as impor-tant from a fatigue standpoint as the lower harmonics. Since these increased moments, particularly the torsional moments, cause increased periodic control loads and increased vibration in the helicopter control system, they may tend to restrict the normal operating l&nits of futnre high-performance helicopters unless an adequate combination of means to reduce these moments and means to design for their fatigue effects is devised...|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the European project FRIENDCOPTER, the Department of Aerospace Engineering of Politecnico di Milano is involved in developing active control systems aimed at reducing the vibration transmission from the gearbox to the cabin in <b>medium-size</b> civil <b>helicopters.</b> An AgustaWestland A 109 MKII mock-up to perform vibroacoustic measurements and control tests. The selected active configuration consists of two smart rear struts with 4 piezoceramic actuators pairs each and a smart anti-torque plate with 6 piezo pacthes on each side. Four independent narrowband FXLMS vibration controllers are designed and implemented to control each beam and {{the two sides of the}} plate. From open-loop vibration and acoustic analysis, a set of annoying tones in a frequency band up to 4 kHz are targeted to be reduced. A movable rack of microphones is placed inside the cabin to monitor the acoustic field over a grid spreading the whole cabin width in an area close to the passenger back seats. Vibration reductions up to 20 dB of the target tones are obtained on the accelerometer error sensors. Acceptable noise reductions of a few tones are achieved over certain zones, but the result cannot be extended to the whole cabin. An optimization algorithm to find the best positioning of the error sensors has been also tested to improve acoustic closed-loop performances...|$|R
