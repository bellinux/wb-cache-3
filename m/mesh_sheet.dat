5000|$|Traditional {{masks are}} most {{commonly}} carved from wood, with various types used. The harvesting of this wood often falls under certain customs related to {{when and how}} the trees may be cut. The most common traditional wood is “zompantle” also called “palo bofo” or “colorín” (Erythrina coralloides) a plant of the legume family which yields a soft white wood often use for more artistic objects and {{has been associated with}} ritual since pre Hispanic times. It is never used to utilitarian items. Other common woods include red cedar and “ayacahuite” (Pinus ayacahuite), both favored for their ability to resist insect infestation. Red cedar masks are most commonly found in the Sierra de Puebla, Papantla area, Chiapa de Corzo and among the Zoques in Chiapas. Poplar wood is commonly used because it can be worked thin and does not splinter. Masks of this wood are most commonly found for the pascola dances of the Mayos and Yaquis. The hardest woods used for masks are mesquite and avocado. Mezquite masks are found in Hidalgo, Zacatecas and the northwest of the country, with avocado wood ones found in the State of Mexico. Copal wood in used mostly in Michoacán and Oaxaca but can be found in Sonora and other states.Other materials used for masks include wax, fired clay, leather, cloth, wire <b>mesh,</b> <b>sheet</b> metal, rubber tires, cardboard and paper mache.

40|$|Abstract—Robotic {{end-effectors}} in automated {{production lines}} are specially {{designed and built}} for a unique task and for a particular part. An end-effector capable of grasping different parts with different geometries will expand its benefit and reduce costs. This work focuses on the grasp of sheet metal parts for the automotive industry. In order to maximize {{the use of a}} single end-effector, this paper proposes a search algorithm for a simple common grasp configuration. Such configuration imply for an end-effector design capable of grasping a set of sheet metal parts. The algorithm maps possible grasps which are candidate to be common. We define a novel quality measure estimating the distribution of the contacts across the sheet metal part. Candidate grasps which have a sufficient quality are mapped into high-dimensional feature vectors. These feature vectors parameterize the geometry of the polyhedron formed by the contacts locations and the direction of the surface normals relative to the polyhedron. Thereby, they describe the design of the end-effector compatible to the grasp. A database is generated for all possible grasps for each part in the feature vector space. A similarity join based on nearest-neighbor search and classification algorithm are used for intersecting all possible feature vectors over all sheet metal parts and finding common ones. Simulations of a 3 -finger grasp on four <b>meshed</b> <b>sheet</b> metal parts resulted in a common grasp. Results of the simulations validate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. I...|$|R
30|$|In this case, we {{consider}} the following two factors {{to be responsible for}} wound dehiscence: one was fragility of the abdominal wall that resulted from a surgical site infection following a previous operation, and the other was the high abdominal pressure when straining to pass stool. A simple primary closure, therefore, seemed insufficient for surgical treatment. Moreover, the hernial orifice in this case was huge, and the abdominal wall around the orifice was weak; therefore, we decided to repair the hernia using a mesh prosthesis. In such a case of incisional hernia, with the pulled-up jejunum passing through the hernial orifice, a mesh prosthesis is required not only to reinforce the abdominal wall but also to allow the pulled-up jejunum to pass through the mesh without disturbing food passage. Therefore, we decided on a parastomal hernia repair technique using a <b>mesh</b> <b>sheet,</b> particularly the keyhole repairing technique [8 – 10], for this case. This surgical technique using mesh, frequently reported to be effective since Rosin and Bonardi developed it [8], is superior to the suture repairing technique with regard to recurrence [rate (range) 17.2 % (11.9 – 23.4 %) vs 69.4 % (59.7 – 78.3 %)] and wound infection [rate (range) 1.9 % (0.4 – 5.5 %) vs 11.8 % (6.1 – 20.2 %)] [12].|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: {{to present}} our {{experience}} with scheduled reoperations in 15 patients with intra-abdominal sepsis. METHODS: we have applied {{a more effective}} technique consisting of temporary abdominal closure with a nylon <b>mesh</b> <b>sheet</b> containing a zipper. We performed reoperations {{in the operating room}} under general anesthesia at an average interval of 84 hours. The revision consisted of debridement of necrotic material and vigorous lavage of the involved peritoneal area. The mean age of patients was 38. 7 years (range, 15 to 72 years); 11 patients were male, and four were female. RESULTS: forty percent of infections were due to necrotizing pancreatitis. Sixty percent were due to perforation of the intestinal viscus secondary to inflammation, vascular occlusion or trauma. We performed a total of 48 reoperations, an average of 3. 2 surgeries per patient. The mesh-zipper device was left in place for an average of 13 days. An intestinal ostomy was present adjacent to the zipper in four patients and did not present a problem for patient management. Mortality was 26. 6 %. No fistulas resulted from this technique. When intra-abdominal disease was under control, the mesh-zipper device was removed, and the fascia was closed in all patients. In three patients, the wound was closed primarily, and in 12 it was allowed to close by secondary intent. Two patients developed hernia; one was incisional and one was in the drain incision. CONCLUSION: the planned reoperation for manual lavage and debridement of the abdomen through a nylon mesh-zipper combination was rapid, simple, and well-tolerated. It permitted effective management of severe septic peritonitis, easy wound care and primary closure of the abdominal wall...|$|E
40|$|The Western Australian School of Mines (WASM) {{developed}} {{a large area}} static test facility to enable the evaluation of three forms of surface support; namely, mesh, shotcrete and membranes. The purpose of this thesis is to document the test conditions and procedures under which these tests were conducted and to document the outcomes from testing. A review of previous mesh testing established that the most common method used {{for the evaluation of}} mesh types was two-dimensional linear elastic analyses, often using catenary principles. These analysis techniques have been used to estimate the tension in the wires of mesh and the strength characteristics of the mesh. These methods assume that forces are only transferred along directly loaded wires and that failure of the mesh is only related to the tensile strength of the wire. The force – displacement response from fully restrained mesh tests conducted at the WASM test facility have been characterised into distinct phases, clearly demonstrating the non-linear behaviour of mesh. The initial force response to displacement is slow; however the force response increases dramatically with further displacement. This behaviour has been shown to follow a cubic relationship. The force – displacement results have also been used to develop load transfer concepts for both weld mesh and chain link mesh. These concepts suggest that forces are transferred away from the directly loaded wires through adjoining wires, distributing forces over a greater area of the mesh. The force capacity of the weld mesh is not only dependent on the tensile strength of the wire but also the quality of the welding process. Likewise, the force capacity of chain link mesh is not only dependent on the tensile strength of the wire but also diamond configuration which allows load to be shared across a greater area of mesh. Several other test conditions were evaluated as part of the test program, including <b>mesh</b> <b>sheet</b> overlaps and wire orientation. The results have demonstrated that the boundary conditions and mesh orientation alters the force – displacement response of mesh. Most current shotcrete testing techniques focus on quality assurance and quality control. Shotcrete support mechanism and failure mechanisms are complex and not well understood. The WASM punch test method was developed to evaluate shotcrete using realistic shotcrete failure mechanisms such as shear and flexural failure and adhesion loss. The behaviour of shotcrete is characterised by an initial stiff reaction followed by rupture of the cement matrix. Rupture generally occurs at displacements of less than 5 mm. The rupture force of fibre reinforced shotcrete is dependent only on the cement content of the shotcrete mix and the thickness of the layer, and not on the fibre type. The post rupture reaction of shotcrete is dependent on the reinforcing material; namely fibres or mesh. Mesh reinforced shotcrete had much greater force and displacement capacity compared with fibre reinforced shotcrete. Membranes have two theoretical support models (Norcroft, 2006); namely, the membrane support model and the beam support model. A total of 6 tests were undertaken to investigate the behaviour of a particular membrane product under the two theoretical support models. These tests were aimed at determining a suitable test method that could determine the capacity of the membrane and the behaviour of the membrane under realistic loading conditions. The results from both test programs demonstrated that the membrane has limited force and displacement capacity and cannot be compared with conventional mesh and shotcrete as suggested in the product data sheet. The failure mechanism was shear failure with minimal adhesion loss observed. The development of the WASM test facility has enabled the evaluation and comparison of various surface support elements. The results of this testing have provide a valuable insight into the performance of each of the individual products...|$|E

Recuperated micro-gas-turbine systems offer the possibility of high efficiency power generation for low output power systems. To this end, increasing the performance while decreasing the cost, the weight and the volume of heat exchangers such as recuperators {{has become a}} critical research focus. Recent work done by Brayton Energy Canada (BEC) has renewed interest in Wire Mesh Heat Exchangers (WMHE) by introducing a new production method that uses cells of stacked wire <b>mesh</b> <b>sheets</b> that have a thick external shell deposited by cold spray. Fins are then machined in this external shell, creating a heat exchanger. Net shaped pin fins were successfully deposited using Cold Gas Dynamic Spraying (CGDS or simply cold spray) as an additive manufacturing technique to replace the plate fin arrays currently used.

The product used for this was Cegrass Erosion Control System by Cebo UK Ltd, in Aberdeen, UK. Cegrass is made of closed cell foamed polypropylene strips, 1.6 centimetres wide, with 24 strips on a plastic clip forming an element. The elements used measured 90, 120 and 150 centimetres long. These elements were attached to steel <b>mesh</b> <b>sheets</b> 600 x 240 centimetres with a grid space of 20 centimetres. The purpose of this artificial sea-grass was to trap sediments that were in the water, causing them to build up {{around the base of the}} mats. They also slowed the force of the current, reducing its damaging effects upon the hull and the contents of the wreck. 43 mats were used and the process took about two weeks. The project cost A$100,000 altogether, and was funded from a special allocation made by the Victorian Government. Evidence of this method’s effectiveness was almost immediate. Within one week 10 to 15 centimeters of sediment had been deposited on all of the mats, and this rate continued until all the scour holes were filled. Within 2 to 3 months sediment was also gradually deposited on the inside area of the wreck, despite continued disturbances of barrels and other artefacts. Light <b>sheets</b> of steel <b>mesh</b> were placed over the exposed areas of the wreck that contained artefacts to prevent their movement off the site.

40|$|At present, {{composite}} materials are mostly used in aircraft structural components, {{because of their}} excellent properties like lightweight, high strength to weight ratio, high stiffness, and corrosion resistance and less expensive. In this experimental work, the mechanical properties of laminate, this is reinforced with stainless steel wire <b>mesh,</b> aluminum <b>sheet</b> metal, perforated aluminum sheet metal and glass fibers to be laminate and investigated. The stainless steel wire mesh and perforated aluminum metal were sequentially stacked to fabricate, hybrid composites. The aluminum metal sheet is also employed with that sequence to get maximum strength and less weight. The tensile, compressive and flexure tests carried out on the hybrid composite. To investigate the mechanical properties and elastic properties of the metal matrix composite laminate of a material we are using experimental test and theoretical calculation. The experimental work consists of Tensile, compressive and flexural test. The expectation of this project results in the tensile and compressive properties of this hybrid composite it is slightly lesser than carbon fibers but it could facilitate a weight reduction compared with CFRP panels. So this hybrid laminates composite material offering significant weight savings and maximum strength over some other GFRP conventional panels...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{interaction}} between the climate system and the large polar ice sheet regions is a key process in global environmental change. We carried out dynamic ice simula-tions {{of one of the}} largest drainage systems in East Antarc-tica: the Lambert Glacier–Amery Ice Shelf system, with an adaptive <b>mesh</b> ice <b>sheet</b> model. The ice sheet model is driven by surface accumulation and basal melt rates com-puted by the FESOM (Finite-Element Sea-Ice Ocean Model) ocean model and the RACMO 2 (Regional Atmospheric Cli-mate Model) and LMDZ 4 (Laboratoire de Météorologie Dy-namique Zoom) atmosphere models. The change of ice thick-ness and velocity in the ice shelf is mainly influenced by the basal melt distribution, but, although the ice shelf thins in most of the simulations, there is little grounding line retreat. We find that the Lambert Glacier grounding line can retreat as much as 40 km if there is sufficient thinning of the ice shelf south of Clemence Massif, but the ocean model does not pro-vide sufficiently high melt rates in that region. Overall, the increased accumulation computed by the atmosphere models outweighs ice stream acceleration so that the net contribution to sea level rise is negative. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{current work}} {{presents}} a finite element approach for numerical simulation of the incremental {{sheet metal forming}} (ISF) process, called here ‘‘ISF-SAM’’ (for ISF-Simplified Analysis Modelling). The main goal {{of the study is}} to develop a simplified FE model sufficiently accurate to simulate the ISF process and quite efficient in terms of CPU time. Some assumptions have been adopted regarding the constitutive strains/stresses equations and the tool/sheet contact conditions. A simplified contact procedure was proposed to predict nodes in contact with the tool and to estimate their imposed displacements.
