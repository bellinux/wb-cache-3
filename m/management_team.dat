The study makes two important findings. First, there is no one path for top <b>management</b> <b>teams</b> to achieve a high-performance council. Second, the capacity of top <b>management</b> <b>teams</b> to work effectively with the elected members is the only factor that distinguishes high-performing from low-performing councils. The only features all high-performing and all low-performing councils do well in are financial monitoring and nurturing teamwork within business/operating units.

40|$|Thesis (M. Edu Management) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2013 The {{quality of}} {{teaching}} and learning is the first priority of the Department of Education and Training.

For them to improve the quality {{of teaching and learning}} effectively and efficiently, they should he able to manage their roles and functioning successfully. School <b>Management</b> <b>Teams</b> need to assist the educators in imparting the knowledge they have to the learners. This will happen only if School <b>Management</b> <b>Teams</b> are trained and inducted in their roles and functioning. They are responsible for daily management of activities in the school. They should understand departmental policies and Acts to enable them to perform their duties well with confidence. A literature study and empirical research were undertaken and the role and functioning of School Management in School-Based Management were explored. A number of their roles were explored. Qualitative in-depth interviews formed the basis of the empirical research. Finally a consent analysis was used to categorize and evaluate data. The findings revealed that SBM is widely followed throughout the world especially in developed countries including South Africa. The role and functioning of School <b>Management</b> <b>Teams</b> under school based- management has become more important in providing the professional leadership required to provide positive learning environment.

This included an investigation into the relationship between size and rent value besides the comparison of the profitability of different retail formats.
