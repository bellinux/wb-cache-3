5|$|Both McLuhan and Innis {{assume the}} {{centrality}} of communication technology; where they differ is in the principal kinds of effects they see deriving from this technology. Whereas Innis sees communication technology principally affecting social organization and culture, McLuhan sees its principal effect on sensory organization and thought. McLuhan has {{much to say about}} perception and thought but little to say about institutions; Innis says <b>much</b> <b>about</b> institutions and little about perception and thought.|$|E

Marlon Brando (Mark Antony) was in awe of him, and James Mason (Brutus) was disheartened at Gielgud's seemingly effortless skill. Gielgud, for his part, felt he learned <b>much</b> <b>about</b> film technique from Mason. Gielgud enjoyed his four-month stay in California, not least, as Morley comments, for the relaxed attitude there to homosexuality.|$|E

5|$|The form of {{this ancient}} Greek poetry is an elegiac couplet, {{commonly}} used for epitaphs. Some English renderings are given in the table below.

Ioannis Ziogas points out that the usual English translations are far from the only interpretation possible, and indicate <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the romantic tendencies of the translators.|$|E

5|$|The missionaries {{were forced}} to proceed slowly, and could not do <b>much</b> <b>about</b> {{eliminating}} pagan practices, or destroying temples or other sacred sites, unlike the missionary efforts {{that had taken place}} in Gaul under St Martin. There was little fighting or bloodshed during the mission. Paganism was still practised in Kent until the 630s, and it was not declared illegal until 640. Although Honorius sent Felix to the East Angles, it appears that most of the impetus for conversion came from the East Anglian king.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} {{constructed}} sometime between the Dissolution and the Union of the Crowns but the exact date is not known. It was probably constructed {{as a strong}} room to store munitions or provide a secure location if the city walls were breached.

5|$|Altar Q is {{the most}} famous {{monument}} at Copán. It was dedicated by king Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat in AD776 and has {{each of the first}} 16 kings of the Copán dynasty carved around its side. Each figure is depicted seated on his name glyph. A hieroglyphic text is inscribed on the upper surface, relating the founding of the dynasty in AD426427. On one side, it shows the dynastic founder K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' transferring power to Yax Pasaj. Interestingly, Tatiana Proskouriakoff first discovered the inscription on the West Side of Altar Q that tells us the date of the inauguration of Yax Pasaj. This portrayal of political succession tells us <b>much</b> <b>about</b> Early Classic Maya culture.|$|E
5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E
