25|$|In July 1974, Flynt first {{published}} Hustler {{as a step}} forward from the Hustler Newsletter, which was advertising for his businesses. The magazine struggled for the first year, partly because many distributors and wholesalers refused to handle it as its nude photos became increasingly graphic. It targeted working-class men and grew from a shaky start to a peak circulation of around three million. The publication of nude paparazzi pictures of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in August 1975 was a major coup. Hustler has often featured more explicit photographs than comparable magazines and has contained depictions of women that some find demeaning, such as a naked woman in a <b>meat</b> <b>grinder</b> or presented as a dog on a leash– though Flynt later said that the <b>meat</b> <b>grinder</b> image was a criticism of the pornography industry itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{industrial}} use of mechanical meat shredding was the technical advance that helped popularize the Hamburg steak. The first <b>meat</b> <b>grinder</b> {{was invented in}} the early 19th century by the German engineer Karl Drais. The machine {{made it possible for}} minced meat to be sold at market in large quantities at reasonable prices. By 1845, numerous patents existed for improved meat grinders in the United States. These machines could all shred meat to sizes before unimaginable. Before this, minced meat was prepared by hand at home using specialized chisels, intensive manual labor that severely limited the amount that could be produced. It is very likely that the invention of the <b>meat</b> <b>grinder</b> contributed directly to the popularization of Hamburg steak, while the steak gradually became distant from its German roots {{in the minds of many}} Americans. Minced meat also came to be used in other popular American foods, including hot dogs and meatloaf.|$|E

[...] Patton then argued that his Third Army should attack toward Koblenz, cutting off the bulge at the base and trap the entirety of the German armies involved in the offensive. After briefly considering this, Bradley vetoed this proposal, as he was less concerned about killing large numbers of Germans than he was in arranging for the relief of Bastogne before it was overrun. Desiring good weather for his advance, which would permit close ground support by U.S. Army Air Forces tactical aircraft, Patton ordered the Third Army chaplain, Colonel James Hugh O'Neill, to compose a suitable prayer: ...|$|E

[...] After the war, internal reviews by the CIA corroborated Hart's findings. [...] The CIA's Seoul station had 200 officers, but not a single speaker of Korean.

In the portion used on the back of the LP, Taylor is seen flying an [...] "angry kite", which represents the aggravation that was pervasive at Apple in 1969, hence the [...] "Grapple with it" [...] message. The faces on Taylor's large wicker chair are Mal Evans and Neil Aspinall, the Beatles' longtime assistants and former road managers. Both men were frequently torn in their loyalties towards the individual Beatles, due to the dysfunction within the band during the Apple era; the cover shows Evans smiling and Aspinall wearing a frown with, in Miles' words, [...] "all the cares of Apple on his shoulders". Harrison's friend Eric Clapton is pictured with a Hendrix-style afro and in psychedelic attire, and holding a guitar. As further examples of the inharmonious atmosphere at Apple, Miles notes that, unlike the four portraits of the Beatles hanging on the office wall, a picture of an Indian yogi with the Om symbol above him is upside down, and so too is the view through the office window in the top right corner of the image.|$|E

50|$|Blade {{grinders}} also resemble industrial blade (propeller) mixers, which like <b>meat</b> <b>grinders</b> rotate at {{much slower}} speeds. Unlike blade grinders, these mixers do not alter (break, cut, shred, macerate, pulverize) the material being mixed. The high {{speed of rotation}} of blade grinders is necessary to achieve their cutting action. In a blender application, the high speed of rotation contributes to shearing, which in turn contributes to aeration {{and the formation of}} emulsions. These are desirable qualities in many food preparations. A blade grinder can run on batteries or more commonly on electricity.|$|R

50|$|Danish {{cooking is}} rooted in the peasant dishes served across the country before the Industrial Revolution in 1860. It was based on the need to make use of natural {{products}} available on or near the family farm. As a result, a variety of brassicas, bread, fish, pork and later potatoes, were eaten everywhere. Families had their own storage of long-lasting dry products, rye for making bread, barley for beer, dried peas for soup and smoked or salted pork. While industrialization brought increases in the consumption of fresh meat and green vegetables, rye bread and potatoes continued to be staples. With the arrival of dairy cooperatives {{in the second half of}} the 19th century, milk also gained favor. Wood-fired ovens and <b>meat</b> <b>grinders</b> contributed to a range of new dishes including frikadeller (meat balls), roast pork, poached cod and steaks of ground beef. Desserts of stewed fruits or berries such as rødgrød date from the same period.|$|R

His illustrations were presented in the time of socialist realist aesthetics announce a reintegration of Slovenian art into the global (Western) context. Among the illustrations is the figure of Cyclops devouring Odysseus' comrades. The image of the one-eyed giant Polyphemus is one which concerned Pregelj all his life: the painter, whose vocation is most dependent on the gaze, can show one eye in profile. And the profiles of others' faces and of his own face interested Pregelj his whole life through. Not only people but also objects were one-eyed: the rosette of a cathedral, which changes into a human figure, a washing machine door, a <b>meat</b> <b>grinder's</b> orifice, a blind “windeye” or window, and so on. The themes of his final two paintings, which he, already more than a year before his boding senseless death at the age of 54, executed but did not complete, are Polyphemus and the Portrait of His Son Vasko.
