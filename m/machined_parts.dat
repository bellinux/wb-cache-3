Jack Brabham and Ron Tauranac called the company they set up in 1961 to design and build formula racing cars to {{customer}} teams Motor Racing Developments (MRD), and this company had a large portfolio of other activities. Initially, Brabham and Tauranac each held 50percent of the shares. Tauranac was responsible for design and running the business, while Brabham was the test driver and arranged corporate deals like the Repco engine supply {{and the use of the}} MIRA wind tunnel. He also contributed ideas to the design process and often <b>machined</b> <b>parts</b> and helped build the cars.|$|E
5|$|The Maschinenpistole 40 ("Machine pistol 40") {{descended from}} its {{predecessor}} the MP 38, {{which was in}} turn based on the MP 36, a prototype made of machined steel. The MP 36 was developed independently by Erma Werke's Berthold Geipel with funding from the German Army. It took design elements from Heinrich Vollmer's VPM 1930 and EMP. Vollmer then worked on Berthold Geipel's MP 36 and in 1938 submitted a prototype to answer a request from the Heereswaffenamt (Army Weapons Office) for a new submachine gun, which was adopted as MP 38. The MP 38 was a simplification of the MP 36, and the MP 40 was a further simplification of the MP 38, with certain cost-saving alterations, most notably in the more extensive use of stamped steel rather than <b>machined</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|E

40|$|Monthly {{counts of}} {{industrial}} <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> errors are modeled using a two-state Hidden Markov Model (HMM) {{in order to}} describe the effect of <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> error correction {{and the amount of}} time spent on the error correction on the likelihood of the <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> to be in a “defective ” or “non-defective” state. The number of <b>machine</b> <b>parts</b> errors were collected from a thermo plastic injection molding machine in a car bumper auto parts manufacturer in Liberec city, Czech Republic from January 2012 to November 2012. A Bayesian method is used for parameter estimation. The results of this study indicate that the <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> error correction and {{the amount of time spent}} on the error correction do not improve the <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> status of the individual part, but there is a very strong month-to-month dependence of the <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> states. Using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) criterion, the performance of the proposed model (MAE = 1. 62) and the HMM including <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> error correction only (MAE = 1. 68), from our previous study, is not significantly different. However, the proposed model has more advantage in the fact that the <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> state can be explained by both the <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> error correction and the amount of time spent on the error correction...|$|R

25|$|Closed-die forging {{has a high}} {{initial cost}} due to the {{creation}} of dies and required design work to make working die cavities. However, it has low recurring costs for each part, thus forgings become more economical with more volume. This {{is one of the major}} reasons closed-die forgings are often used in the automotive and tool industries. Another reason forgings are common in these industrial sectors is that forgings generally have about a 20 percent higher strength-to-weight ratio compared to cast or <b>machined</b> <b>parts</b> of the same material.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s, the {{international}} nuclear sales market was extremely competitive, with many national nuclear companies being supported by their governments' foreign embassies.

25|$|Sweden {{remained}} officially neutral during World War I and World War II, {{although its}} neutrality during World War II has been disputed. Sweden was under German influence {{for much of}} the war, as ties {{to the rest of the}} world were cut off through blockades. The Swedish government felt that it was in no position to openly contest Germany, and therefore made some concessions. Sweden also supplied steel and <b>machined</b> <b>parts</b> to Germany throughout the war. However, Sweden supported Norwegian resistance, and in 1943 helped rescue Danish Jews from deportation to Nazi concentration camps. Sweden also supported Finland in the Winter War and the Continuation War with volunteers and materiel.|$|E
25|$|The {{experience}} of the War of 1812 led the War Department to issue a request for contract proposals for firearms with interchangeable parts. Previously, parts from each firearm had to be carefully custom fitted; almost all infantry regiments necessarily included an artificer or armorer who could perform this intricate gunsmithing. The requirement for interchangeable parts forced forward the development of modern metal-working machine tools, including milling machines, grinders, shapers and planers. The Federal Armories perfected the use of machine tools by developing fixtures to correctly position the parts being machined and jigs to guide the cutting tools over the proper path. Systems of blocks and gauges were also developed to check the accuracy and precision of the <b>machined</b> <b>parts.</b> Developing the manufacturing techniques for making interchangeable parts by the Federal Armories took over two decades; however, the first interchangeable small arms parts were not made to {{a high degree of}} precision. It wasn't until mid century or later that parts for U.S. rifles and handguns could be considered truly interchangeable with a degree of precision. In 1853 when the British Parliamentary Committee on Small Arms questioned gun maker Samuel Colt, and machine tool makers James Nasmyth and Joseph Whitworth, there was still some question about what constituted interchangeability and whether it could be achieved at a reasonable cost.|$|E
2500|$|The Model 1921 (M1921) was {{the first}} major {{production}} model. Fifteen thousand were produced by Colt for Auto-Ordnance. In its original design, it was finished more like a sporting weapon, with an adjustable rear sight, a blued, finned barrel and vertical foregrip (or pistol grip) and the Blish lock. The M1921 was quite expensive to manufacture, with the original retail price around $200, because of its high-quality wood furniture and finely <b>machined</b> <b>parts.</b> The M1921 was famous throughout its career with police and criminals and in motion pictures. This model gained fame from its use by criminals during Prohibition, and was nicknamed [...] "tommy gun" [...] by the media.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{considerable}} {{planning and}} expenditure in 1930 {{was going into}} improving the passenger operation, it was hoped to increase revenue from the IR's freight business. Less-than-carload (LCL) overnight deliveries [...] between the various IR-linked towns (and to or from Ohio) was not available from the competing railroads; the latter typically required {{two to three days}} to complete a shipment. An example is delivering <b>machined</b> <b>parts</b> made in Terre Haute overnight to Fort Wayne auto manufacturer Auburn. Prior to 1930, cartage business already existed due to the interurban's ties to local power companies. At night the IR's arch windowed wood bodied box motors would rumble down the quiet brick streets of an Indiana town towing one or two gondolas loaded with coal for the local power plant. In some cases, freight trains operating on city streets became an objection of town councils, particularly if those trains operated during the day. Many merchants, newspapers, and small manufacturing companies used the frequent interurban scheduling provided. Had this freight business increased with an improving economy along with the greater sales generated by a motivated sales force, the IR would have had a promising future. The idea was a good one, but the national economy didn't improve. Instead, it collapsed further. When the Indiana Railroad lost its important freight interchange connection with neighboring interurban Dayton and Western (which connected at Dayton with the busy Cincinnati and Lake Erie interurban to the Ohio towns of Toledo, Cincinnati, Springfield, and Columbus) prospects for the line's survival were poor. The C abandoned operations in early 1938 when it lost its interurban connection to Cleveland. The IR continued to barely survive with just Indiana freight business, but its lines were abandoned one by one. Today, one operation on IR track survives as the Southern Indiana Railroad between Speed and Watson Jct handling concrete from Essroc Cement for interchange with the CSX/B at Watson trains using diesel locomotives.|$|E
