5|$|<b>Magmatism</b> {{continued}} in the Gangdese arc until as late as 40 Ma.|$|E
5|$|The South Lhasa terrane {{experienced}} metamorphism and <b>magmatism</b> in the Early Cenozoic (55–45 Ma) and metamorphism in the Late Eocene (40–30 Ma), presumably due to {{the collision}} between the continents of India and Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|Various {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} {{to account for the}} volume and diversity of Siletzian <b>magmatism,</b> as well as the approximately 75° of rotation, but the evidence is insufficient to determine Siletzia's origin; the question remains open.|$|E
5|$|Large {{deposits}} {{of fossil fuels}} are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting of coal, petroleum, and natural gas. These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production. Mineral ore bodies have also been formed within the crust {{through a process of}} ore genesis, resulting from actions of <b>magmatism,</b> erosion, and plate tectonics. These bodies form concentrated sources for many metals and other useful elements.|$|E
5|$|As Siletzia accreted it also {{jammed the}} {{existing}} subduction zone, halting subduction of the Farallon plate. This terminated the Laramide orogeny {{that had been}} uplifting the Rocky Mountains, and triggered the ignimbrite sweep, a wave of large-volume silicic <b>magmatism</b> that swept over much of western North America between 50 and 20 Ma. This undoubtedly affected the enigmatic and controversial Challis Arc (stretching from southeastern British Columbia to the Idaho Batholith, roughly parallel with the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament), but {{the details of this}} are unknown.|$|E
5|$|This {{study has}} been criticized on {{multiple}} grounds, particularly regarding the ages. Duncan himself noted that measurement of the northern ages may {{have been affected by}} loss of argon due to low-grade metamorphism, and that there might be bias in respect of stratigraphic position. The latter was demonstrated by a recent study that showed, on the basis of geochemistry, that the Grays River volcanics followed the Siletzia eruptions, and thus are not representative of the initial phase of Siletz <b>magmatism.</b> Recent dating also shows a more monotonic trend of south to north age progression ("younging").|$|E
5|$|<b>Magmatism</b> in the Anahim Volcanic Belt can {{be traced}} {{as far back as}} 10–14million years ago with the {{emplacement}} of dike swarms and plutons as well as the eruption of rhyolite flows and breccias on the British Columbia Coast. The slow continuous westward motion of the North American Plate during the late Neogene positioned the Anahim hotspot further east at the Chilcotin Plateau where volcanic activity built the Rainbow Range shield volcano 8.7to 6.7million years ago. Volcanism then shifted eastwards, in displacement contrary with the North American Plate's movement, 6.1million years ago to construct the Ilgachuz Range shield volcano, which became extinct 2.1million years later. Renewed volcanic activity southeast of the Ilgachuz Range starting 3.5million years ago {{led to the creation of}} the Itcha Range, the youngest of the three Anahim shield volcanoes. The Itcha Range continued to be an area of Anahim hotspot volcanism well into the Quaternary period (2.58million years ago to present).|$|E
25|$|Boninite <b>magmatism</b> {{is similar}} to komatiite <b>magmatism</b> but is {{produced}} by fluid-fluxed melting above a subduction zone. Boninites with 10–18% MgO tend to have higher large-ion lithophile elements (LILE: Ba, Rb, Sr) than komatiites.|$|E
25|$|Intruding these {{rocks in}} central Palawan (Cleopatra's Needle area) and {{northern}} Palawan (Mount Capoas or Kapoas area) are young granite bodies (true granite to granodiorite). The Kapoas intrusion is of Miocene age (13-15 {{million years old}} based on zircon and monazite U-Pb dating). In the Taytay area of northern Palawan, a young basaltic cinder cone is another manifestation of young magmatic activity. The granitic <b>magmatism</b> and basaltic <b>magmatism</b> are both expressions {{of what has been}} identified as a widespread post-South China Sea spreading <b>magmatism</b> that has affected many areas around the South China Sea.|$|E
25|$|Plume <b>magmatism</b> is an {{effective}} mechanism for explaining the large volumes of <b>magmatism</b> required to inflate an intrusion to several kilometres thickness (up to and greater than 13 kilometres). Plumes also tend to create warping of the crust, weaken it thermally {{so that it is}} easier to intrude magma and create space to host the intrusions.|$|E
25|$|Geochemical {{evidence}} supports {{the hypothesis that}} some intrusions result from plume <b>magmatism.</b> In particular, the Noril'sk-Talnakh intrusions {{are considered to be}} created by plume <b>magmatism,</b> and other large intrusions have been suggested as created by mantle plumes. However, the story is not so simple, because most ultramafic-mafic layered intrusions also correlate with craton margins, perhaps because they are exhumed more efficiently in cratonic margins because of faulting and subsequent orogeny.|$|E
25|$|The plume <b>magmatism</b> {{theory is}} based on {{observations}} that most large igneous provinces include both hypabyssal and surficial manifestations of voluminous mafic <b>magmatism</b> within the same temporal period. For instance, in most Archaean cratons, greenstone belts correlate with voluminous dike injections as well as usually some form of larger intrusive episodes into the crust. This is particularly true {{of a series of}} ultramafic-mafic layered intrusions in the Yilgarn Craton of ~2.8 Ga and associated komatiite volcanism and widespread tholeiitic volcanism.|$|E
25|$|Because {{most of the}} Circum-Superior Belt {{was formed}} by {{widespread}} mafic-ultramafic <b>magmatism</b> 1,884to 1,864million years ago along the Superior craton margin during these orogenies, {{a number of different}} suggestions have been made to explain the questionable origins of this large igneous province. It is also not clear if the Circum-Superior Belt has a single origin or it has several origins. Suggestions include back-arc rifting, foredeep flexure, mantle plumes and the breakup of a microcontinent. The geochemical indication of the Circum-Superior Belt is also poorly known; either it contains major regional differences or it is the same throughout the magmatic zone. With the discovery of the Pickle Crow dike swarm throughout the western Superior craton, the likelihood of other 1,880million year old dike groups throughout the Superior craton remains. This is partly because several dike zones in the Superior craton remain undated. The relationship of the Circum-Superior Belt with similar age <b>magmatism</b> throughout the nearby Trans-Hudson belt and elsewhere on Earth is also unknown. This includes the 1,860million year old <b>magmatism</b> of the East Kimberly event in Australia and 1,860million year old <b>magmatism</b> of the Mashonaland event in Africa. The other questionable suggestion related to the Circum-Superior Belt is the existence of a suggested 1,900million year old global superplume event.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to precisely determine what causes large ultramafic – mafic intrusives to be emplaced within the crust, {{but there are two}} main hypotheses: plume <b>magmatism</b> and rift upwelling.|$|E
25|$|<b>Magmatism</b> in island arc regions (i.e., active oceanic margins) {{comes from}} the interplay of the subducting plate and the mantle wedge, the {{wedge-shaped}} region between the subducting and overriding plates.|$|E
25|$|Volcanic {{activity}} at Maitland Volcano {{was consistent with}} extensional stresses across the northern Canadian Cordillera that began around 10million {{years ago as a}} result of new plate motions between the Pacific and North American plates. This contributed to lithospheric thinning and decompression melting of OIB-like mantle to produce alkaline Neogene <b>magmatism.</b> The time span of 600,000years for <b>magmatism</b> at Maitland Volcano is relatively small compared to other large NCVP shield volcanoes. This supports field evidence for rapid, relatively uninterrupted growth of the volcanic edifice. The suspension of Maitland volcanism corresponds with changes in regional tectonics about four million years ago.|$|E
25|$|The {{channel and}} sheeted flows are then covered by high-magnesian basalts and tholeiitic basalts as the {{volcanic}} event evolves to less magnesian compositions. The subsequent <b>magmatism,</b> being higher silica melts, tends {{to form a}} more typical shield volcano architecture.|$|E
25|$|Maitland's {{volcanic}} {{history is}} poorly known since only isolated {{remnants of the}} volcano remain. What is known, however, is that it formed during a pulse of NCVP <b>magmatism</b> {{that began with the}} eruption of Edziza about seven million years ago. The eruption rate of this period was much greater than what is observed for the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province today. Following the onset of activity at Edziza, Maitland volcanism commenced 5.2million years ago with the outpouring of alkali basalt and hawaiite lava on a broad, late Tertiary, low-relief surface. This resulted {{in the creation of a}} broad shield volcano. Subsequent volcanic activity created a complex edifice of trachyte and trachybasalt that formerly overlain the central part of the basaltic shield. <b>Magmatism</b> at Maitland continued until about 4.6million years ago when the volcano went extinct.|$|E
25|$|Intrusive komatiites (ultramafic {{volcanic}} rocks) occur {{along the}} Norseman-Wiluna Greenstone Belt. A change from volcanic-dominated to plutonic-dominated <b>magmatism</b> {{occurred in the}} Norseman-Wiluna Greenstone Belt approximately 2685–2675 Ma. Voluminous high-Ca granite intrusions occurred 2670–2655 Ma. Much of the gold was deposited between 2650–2630 Ma, with much of this associated with strike-slip reactivation of earlier faults (normal and reverse).|$|E
25|$|Sediments {{from the}} Late Permian to Triassic periods are absent in the Cesar-Ranchería Basin, but {{evidenced}} {{in the surrounding}} orogens. Intense <b>magmatism</b> and metamorphism affected the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Central Ranges of the Colombian Andes. The compressive phase {{is associated with the}} Hercynian orogeny, leading to the formation of Pangea.|$|E
25|$|Abraham Gottlob Werner and {{the proponents}} of neptunism in the 18th century {{regarded}} basaltic sills as solidified oils or bitumen. While these notions proved unfounded, the basic idea of an association between petroleum and <b>magmatism</b> persisted. Alexander von Humboldt proposed an inorganic abiogenic hypothesis for petroleum formation after he observed petroleum springs in the Bay of Cumaux (Cumaná) on the northeast coast of Venezuela.|$|E
25|$|In the Cape Smith Belt of {{northern}} Quebec, the Raglan Mine lies in copper-nickel deposits of the ultramafic Katiniq Suite sills. The Katiniq Suite sills are also within {{an area that}} is presently explored for nickel, copper and platinum group element deposits. Copper, nickel and platinum group elements are associated with mafic-ultramafic rocks in the Labrador Trough that were formed during a period of <b>magmatism</b> 1,883to 1,870million years ago.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{foundation}} of the Pampas, the Sierras has been involved in a series of extensional events in the Late Paleozoic (Gondwanan cycle), the latter accompanied by a large <b>magmatism,</b> volcanism, and finally the Cenozoic Andean orongenic cycle, which produced the present morphology. The brittle tectonic Andica is represented by reverse faults among which stand out in the hills of Cordoba those high peaks, the Giants, Copina and Cumbrecita.|$|E
25|$|Other mechanisms, such as melting from a {{meteorite}} impact, are less important today, but impacts during the accretion of the Earth led to extensive melting, {{and the outer}} several hundred kilometers of our early Earth was probably an ocean of magma. Impacts of large meteorites {{in the last few}} hundred million years have been proposed as one mechanism responsible for the extensive basalt <b>magmatism</b> of several large igneous provinces.|$|E
25|$|The 1,850-year-old Penokean <b>magmatism</b> in Wisconsin {{represents}} margin-type igneous activity terminated by collision. Some of the Penokean granites show {{iron enrichment}} {{similar to the}} magnetite series, rather than the low-oxygen concentration of the magnetic titanium oxides. Penokean-age rocks in the northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan contain areas of low-pressure, low- to high-temperature metamorphism. The folding and metamorphism increased in intensity {{to the south and}} southeast, and produced the isolated gneissic 1,755-million-year-old Watersmeet Domes which straddle the border of Michigan and northeastern Wisconsin.|$|E
25|$|During the Cretaceous, the basins of {{northern}} South America were connected in a back-arc basin setting. The {{first phase of}} the Andean orogeny uplifted the Western Ranges and was characterised by <b>magmatism</b> in the Sierra de San Lucas in the northern Central Ranges, dated to the Albian to Cenomanian epochs. Sedimentation on the northern South American platform was of siliciclastic and carbonate character, the latter more dominant in the northern areas. In the Cesar-Ranchería Basin, this led to the deposition of the main source rock formations of the basin, most notably La Luna.|$|E
25|$|In the Potrillo {{volcanic}} field, {{there are}} 10 to 15foot thick layers of basalt {{spread across the}} volcanic field, from lava breaching {{the walls of the}} cinder cone and shield volcanoes, spilling down the flanks and spreading across the surrounding surface. The Potrillo area is generally classified as part of the southern Rio Grande rift and shows the Cenozoic tectonic evolution of that structure. Extension took place in an intense 30–20 Ma phase, involving low-angle normal faults, and a less intense <10 Ma phase, involving high-angle normal. Mack & Seager (1995) argued that the Quaternary <b>magmatism</b> reached the surface via a transfer zone linking two adjacent N–S-trending, long-lived, extensional structures—the West Robledo and Camel Mountain faults.|$|E
25|$|The Potrillo {{volcanic}} {{field has}} two important xenolith localities that are Kilbourne Hole and Potrillo maar where mantle peridotites, feldspathic granulites and kaersutite occur. Alkali feldspar, olivine and basalt were erupted {{during the middle}} and late quaternary. Rock samples collected {{in the northern part}} of the pyroclastic deposit of the Potrillo maar, and lava associated with a cinder cone yielded potassium–argon ages, approximately 1.29 and 1.18million years. The <b>magmatism</b> is entirely basaltic forming scattered scoria cones. Several short lava flows were originated from each cone. There is a diverse rock types beneath the Potrillo volcanics, the range is from Proterozoic granites through a Phanerozoic sedimentary succession to basalt-andesite volcanics of the southern fringes of the Sierra de las Uvas volcanic field. The Potrillo area is generally classified as part of the southern Rio Grande rift and shows the Cenozoic tectonic evolution of that structure.|$|E
25|$|The islands {{form the}} Macaronesia {{ecoregion}} with the Azores, Cape Verde, Madeira, and the Savage Isles. The Canary Islands {{is the largest}} and most populated archipelago of the Macaronesia region. The archipelago consists of seven large and several smaller islands, all of which are volcanic in origin. The Teide volcano on Tenerife is the highest mountain in Spain, and the third tallest volcano on Earth on a volcanic ocean island. All the islands except La Gomera have been active in the last million years; four of them (Lanzarote, Tenerife, La Palma and El Hierro) have historical records of eruptions since European discovery. The islands rise from Jurassic oceanic crust associated {{with the opening of the}} Atlantic. Underwater <b>magmatism</b> commenced during the Cretaceous, and reached the ocean's surface during the Miocene. The islands are considered as a distinct physiographic section of the Atlas Mountains province, which in turn is part of the larger African Alpine System division.|$|E
25|$|As the {{northern}} Atlantic {{opened to the}} east of Greenland during the Eocene, North America and Eurasia drifted apart; the Mid-Atlantic Ridge formed as an oceanic spreading center and a part of the submarine volcanic system of mid-oceanic ridges. The initial plume head may have been several thousand kilometers in diameter, and it erupted volcanic rocks {{on both sides of the}} present ocean basin to produce the North Atlantic Igneous Province. Upon further opening of the ocean and plate drift, the plume and the mid-Atlantic Ridge are postulated to have approached one another, and finally met. The excess <b>magmatism</b> that accompanied the transition from flood volcanism on Greenland, Ireland and Norway to present-day Icelandic activity was the result of ascent of the hot mantle source beneath progressively thinning lithosphere, according to the plume model, or a postulated unusually productive part of the mid-ocean ridge system. Some geologist have suggested that the Iceland plume could have been responsible for the Paleogene uplift of the Scandinavian Mountains by producing changes in the density of the lithosphere and asthenosphere during the opening of the North Atlantic.|$|E
25|$|The Mackenzie dike swarm is {{the largest}} dike swarm known on Earth {{and is one of}} the several dike swarms found {{throughout}} the Canadian Shield. Mafic dikes cut Archean and Proterozoic rocks of the Canadian Shield, including those in the Athabasca Basin in Saskatchewan, the Thelon Basin in Nunavut and the Baker Lake Basin in the Northwest Territories. The mafic dikes display evidence that the unmetamorphosed basin-fill sequence was deposited before the Mackenzie dikes were intruded into the associated basins. When the giant Mackenzie dike swarm intruded into the Canadian Shield, it partly uplifted and intruded the Slave craton in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. This was the last major event to affect the core of the Slave craton, although later on some younger mafic <b>magmatism</b> registered along its boundaries. This includes the magmatic events that formed the 723million year old Franklin Large Igneous Province and the 780million year old Hottah gabbro sheets. Since the Mackenzie dike swarm intruded the Slave craton, the craton has been repeatedly submerged under seas.|$|E
500|$|... {{showed that}} most of the Eocene and {{subsequent}} <b>magmatism</b> from Alaska to Oregon [...] "is explainable in terms of ridge subduction and slab window tectonics." [...] That is, a slab window — and a single subducted ridge can give rise to multiple slab windows — can provide adequate <b>magmatism</b> without having to invoke a hotspot (mantle plume). (So much so that {{it has been suggested that}} the Yellowstone hotspot may have been initiated by a slab window.) Mantle plumes and slab windows both feature voluminous magmatism; the main difference is that slab windows would form only where the spreading ridge is subducted. This implies formation at the continental margin, and then rifting, in the manner of the second class of models.|$|E

2500|$|Before 2003, all <b>magmatism</b> of the Circum-Superior Belt {{was thought}} to only occur along the outer margin of the Superior craton. However, the Pickle Crow dike was {{discovered}} in 2003 {{in the interior of}} the Superior craton and it has since been recognized as a magmatic event related to the Circum-Superior Belt. The dike is dated to 1,880million years old and associated dikes are traced for at least [...] These dikes likely extend over [...] across the western portion of the Superior craton from near the Fox River Belt in the north to near Lake Superior in the south. This magmatic crossing creates a relationship with the 1,880million-year-old <b>magmatism</b> in the northwestern portion of the Circum-Superior Belt and <b>magmatism</b> in the Marguette Range Supergroup on the southern portion of the Circum-Superior Belt. In addition, the north-northwest trend of the Pickle Crow dikes and the absolute north-northeastern trend of the Molson dike swarm combine to an area north of the northwestern portion of the Circum-Superior Belt. This might determine the zone of a mantle plume that was the source for the 1,880million-year-old <b>magmatism</b> in the Circum-Superior Belt.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] long Labrador Trough, {{extending}} from Ungava Bay through Quebec and Labrador, includes two volcano-sedimentary series, the first ranging from 2,170to 2,140million {{years old and}} second ranging from 1,883to 1,870million years old. This <b>magmatism</b> is considered to have formed {{as a result of}} back-arc volcanism.
