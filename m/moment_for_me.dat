500|$|This {{episode was}} the most-watched Fox program on its airdate among adults 18 to 49; 5.75 million viewers watched. In {{his review of}} the Family Guy volume 3 DVD, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk wrote [...] "But if any moment stands out among this run, it's the {{supermarket}} scene in [...] "Breaking Out is Hard to Do." [...] When Chris is pulled into the [...] "Take On Me" [...] video by a-ha, it's a perfect blend of what this show does best, combining nonsense, the '80s and some neat animation. The lead-in, the punchline and {{the execution of the}} whole scene is handled so well that it might be one of the show's most memorable ever." [...] In her review of the episode, Kim Voynar of TV Squad wrote [...] "This was, overall, a very funny episode. Lots of funny references—the Trix Rabbit, Karl Malden, MASH, Star Wars, [...] "Three's Company" [...] The funniest <b>moment</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> was the bit with Stewie walking in on Brian cross-dressing. That alone was worth the price of admission." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "The Boys of Bummer" [...] {{originally}} {{aired on}} the Fox {{network in the}} United States on April 29, 2007. Since then, it has received generally mixed reviews from critics. However, Adam Finley of TV Squad commented that [...] "In general, I liked this episode. At least, {{it had a lot}} more laugh-out-loud <b>moments</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> than last week's episode. I don't think the town has turned on Bart so savagely since that time he cut the head off the Jebediah Springfield statue. I thought the absurdity of everyone getting upset over children's sport made it even funnier." [...] He concluded that [...] "I thought perhaps the scene where Bart paints 'I Hate Bart Simpson' all over town might have had more of an emotional weight to it, giving the episode that nice funny/emotional balance that is the stuff of all the best Simpsons episodes, but clearly this episode was meant to be played mostly for laughs." ...|$|R

2500|$|On 29 July the Gold Coast Football Club {{announced}} {{the signing of}} professional Rugby League player Karmichael Hunt. The three-year contract would begin in May 2010 when Hunt completed his prior commitments to play Rugby Union in France. The local media was quick to label the signing a publicity stunt with most media outlets tipping Hunt {{to return to the}} NRL before his contract expired. Hunt completed his last game for the Broncos in a preliminary final loss to the Melbourne Storm at Etihad Stadium. [...] "It's a bit of a sad <b>moment</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> but I will still be playing football in the future, it will just be a different code." [...] Hunt said after the game.

2500|$|In 1995, {{following}} a spell {{in a drug}} rehab clinic, which first alerted the public to her drug problem, Westbrook was reintroduced into EastEnders by executive producer Corinne Hollingworth. She has commented, [...] "the call from the producers couldn't {{have come at a}} more opportune <b>moment</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> The soap was suffering from poor ratings and so they decided, as they normally do, to bring some familiar faces back onto the Square. The producers were aware of my addiction by now [...] but they had also read that I was now clean [...] once I assured them that I was well [...] they invited me back for another year." [...] The character's [...] "dramatic" [...] return to EastEnders aired on 25 July 1995 and began when her screen brothers traced Sam to Spain and she ended up in bed with [...] "bad boy" [...] David Wicks (Michael French). Several cast changes had occurred since Westbrook had last been in the soap, including a recast of her screen mother Peggy, who was now played by Barbara Windsor. As well as her former friends, Westbrook has revealed that she became particularly close to Windsor, who she says [...] "instantly took me under her wing", and Martine McCutcheon, who played Tiffany Raymond.|$|E

I don't see how I can go on with life. This summer has been so full. I never was lonely <b>for</b> a <b>moment.</b> Before Owen came {{there used to be}} horrible moments--when I had been with you and Gilbert--and then had to leave you.

5000|$|On {{being asked}} {{about what was}} her {{takeaway}} from the journey by the The Hollywood Reporter Oh replied, [...] " [...] It's Ellen's (Pompeo) line where she says, [...] "I am not finished."

2500|$|Evert {{went into}} the 1982 Australian Open, having never won the tournament down under, which she wanted to rectify that fact and the gap on her grand slam resume. [...] Evert's {{opponent}} in the final was Navratilova, who was the defending champion. [...] The final was tied as one set apeice, and {{went into the}} pivotal and crucial third set, which in the second game Evert broke Navratilova to go up two games to none. [...] But in the third game, Evert failed to hold serve and lost the game. Subsequently, Evert quickly took the break advantage back in the fourth game to lead three games to one, and held serve to go up four games to one, which Evert said [...] "I thought...this is it." [...] Evert would quickly come back to reality, when feisty Navratilova, held serve in the sixth game of the set, then broke Evert in the seventh game of the set to narrow the gap to four games to three. [...] All this time, Evert was thinking about last years final, which eluded her grasp. [...] This one would be different however because in the eight game would break Navratilova, and the ninth would go to 30-love on a splendid crosscourt forehand, which at match point she hit a blazing winner {{to the other side of}} the court. [...] This was Evert's first Australian Open, which completed her career grand slam, and her fourteenth slam title for her career just ten days before her twenty-eighth birthday. [...] Later, Evert told reporters [...] "I have wanted this tournament so badly. [...] Then it was over and I had won it...it was a very emotional <b>moment</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> because this title meant so much...the Australian title has been the missing link in my career. [...] I am not thinking about retiring, but I would have hated to look back in 10 years and see something missing from my career." ...|$|E

40|$|Taking as {{its point}} of {{departure}} Walter Benjamin’s repeatedly unsuccessful attempt to give spatial form to his past, this paper {{suggests that it is}} perhaps the contemporary French anthropologist, Marc Augé, who provides the most appropriate envisioning of a ‘map of memories’ in his brief writings on the Parisian métro system. For Augé, the labyrinthine subway network constitutes nothing less than a ‘memory machine’ in which lines and station names serve as mnemonics, recalling long-forgotten childhood encounters and experiences. Mirroring the cityscape above, places themselves unexplored, unknown, the serried toponyms of the métro become an incantation summoning forth the shades of the past. As Augé points out, those stations that provide opportunities to change lines are felicitously termed ‘correspondences’, a Baudelairean term that fascinated Benjamin and informed his key historiographical notion of the ‘dialectical image,’ the intersection and mutual illumination of past and present <b>moments.</b> <b>For</b> <b>me,</b> Augé’s highly suggestive reflections bring to mind my own memories of a London childhood around 1970. Looking at the London underground map today, I cannot but see the sites of many past meetings and partings, dots connected by lines forming complex figures, constellations of memory...|$|R

Ah! when imagination once runs riot where do we stop?

5000|$|I am very {{strategic}} {{about getting}} coverage (the amount of shots {{it takes to}} tell the story within a scene). Some directors believe in shooting everything from every conceivable angle, and then working the material in the cutting room.
