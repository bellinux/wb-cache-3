She said that [...] "Because I was the only woman, they were curious whether I could do it or not". As an assistant driver, she drove shunters. She was promoted as motor-woman in 2000.

Please click on the hyperlink in Additional Links fieldOBJECTIVES: To estimate medical risk factors amongst drivers in single-car accidents with special reference to sleepiness and alcohol abuse. DESIGN: An epidemiological survey by means of multiple-choice questionnaires that were <b>mailed</b> to <b>drivers</b> and a random control group. SETTING: Iceland. SUBJECTS: All drivers in single-car accidents (n = 471) during 1989 - 91 and a control group {{from the general population}} (n = 1000). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Medical health profile and answers to questions concerning sleep disorders and alcohol abuse. RESULTS: Compared to the controls the drivers were younger and there were three times more males. The drivers abused alcohol more often. Chronic disorders such as epilepsy, diabetes mellitus, and cardiac disorders were not over-represented. Altogether, 15. 4 % claimed that sleepiness had caused their traffic accident, logistic regression analyses revealed that these 'sleepy' drivers more often had alcohol abuse and a history of 'almost falling a sleep whilst driving'. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to controls, drivers in single-car accidents {{are more likely to be}} young, male, have a history of sleepiness whilst driving, and also have a history suggestive of alcoholism. Chronic disorders like epilepsy and diabetes mellitus were not over-represented amongst the single-car accidents drivers. These results raise the question of how drivers with a high probability of causing an accident (sleepiness and alcoholism) can be identified in time and proper measures taken to prevent 'accidents waiting to happen'...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{long-term}} health effect of whole-body vibration, a questionnaire on symptoms of ill health was <b>mailed</b> to 242 <b>drivers</b> and a reference group of 210 workers from six harbor companies (response 81 %).

Vibration level during a representative working period (vector {{sum of the}} frequency weighted acceleration in the x-, y-, and z-directions) was 0. 8 m/sec 2 for the fork-lift trucks and 1. 0 m/sec 2 for the freight-container tractors.

The authors investigated this association in a population-based case-control study of Hispanic and non-Hispanic White women living in the southwestern United States. Breast cancer cases diagnosed in 1999 – 2004 were identified through state cancer registries (1, 526 non-Hispanic Whites, 798 Hispanics). Age- and ethnicity-matched controls (1, 599 non-Hispanic Whites, 924 Hispanics) were selected from commercial <b>mailing</b> lists and <b>driver’s</b> license and Social Security records. Diabetes history was assessed through interviewer-administered questionnaires. Odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated using logistic regression, adjusting for age, body mass index at age 15 years, and parity. Having any type of diabetes was not associated with breast cancer overall (odds ratio 0. 94, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 78, 1. 12). Type 2 diabetes was observed among 19 % of Hispanics and 9 % of non-Hispanic Whites but was not associated with breast cancer in either group. Gestational diabetes was inversely associated with breast cancer in both ethnic groups, especially when first diagnosed at age 35 years (odds ratio 0. 54, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 37, 0. 79).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine factors which affect driving {{behaviour}} and accident rates in women in Australia. Two groups of women (aged 18 - 23 and 45 - 50 years) participating in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women 2 ̆ 7 s Health, completed a <b>mailed</b> questionnaire on <b>driver</b> behaviour and road accidents. Self reported accident rates in the last 3 years were 1. 87 per 100 000 km for the young drivers (n = 1199) and 0. 59 per 100 000 km for the mid-age drivers (n = 1564); most accidents involved damage only, not injury. Mean scores for lapses obtained using the Driver Behaviour Questionnaire, were similar in the two age groups and similar to those found in other studies. In contrast, scores for errors and violations for the young women were higher than for the mid-age group and previous reports using the same instruments. Riskier driving behaviour among young women was associated with stress and habitual alcohol consumption. In the mid-age group, poorer driver behaviour scores were related to higher levels of education, feeling rushed, higher habitual alcohol consumption and lower life satisfaction scores. Accident rates in both groups were significantly related to lapses. Women born in non-English speaking countries had significantly higher risk of accidents compared to Australian-born women: relative risk = 3. 40, 95...|$|R
40|$|Statistical {{accident}} data {{plays an important}} role for traffic safety development involving the road system, vehicle design, and driver education. Vehicle manufacturers use data from accident mail surveys {{as an integral part of}} the product development process. Low response rates has, however, lead to concerns on whether estimates from a mail survey can be trusted as a source for making strategic decisions. The main objective of this paper was to investigate nonresponse bias in a <b>mail</b> survey addressing <b>driver</b> behaviour in accident situations. Insurance data, available for both respondents and nonrespondents were used to analyze, as well as adjust for nonresponse. Response propensity was investigated by using descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses. The survey data was then weighted by using inverse propensity weights. Two specific examples of survey estimates are addressed, namely driver vigilance and driver's distraction just before the accident. The results from this paper reveal that driver age and accident type were the most influential variables for nonresponse weighting. Driver gender and size of town where the driver resides also had some influence, but not for all survey variables investigated. The main conclusion of this paper is that nonresponse weighting can increase confidence in {{accident data}} collected by a mail survey, especially when response rates are low. Weighting has a moderate influence on this survey, but a larger influence may be expected if applied on a more diverse driver population. The development of auxiliary data collection can further improve accident mail survey methodology in future...|$|R
