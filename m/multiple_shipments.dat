Similar patterns of production can also be observed in many petrochemical industries where items are produced through refining processes of crude oil.

Today, all the above industries are rework those imperfect products into perfect ones due to limited availability of natural resources. However, all industries have {{a lot of pressure to}} sell those reworked products to downstream channel members due to the lack of proper knowledge about inventory system.

A farmer would adjust his herd milking schedule to have the milk cans filled shortly before scheduled arrival of the train. When <b>multiple</b> farmers required <b>shipment,</b> a separate car might be carried by the train specifically for milk cans; and that car could be delivered directly to the creamery to minimize time required for intermediate handling of the milk cans with other baggage.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses problems arising in freight routing {{and scheduling}} where full truckload (FTL) and less-than-truckload (LTL) carriers {{are used to}} serve transportation needs. Each of the problems investigated in this dissertation tries to optimize/maximize consolidation to decrease system transportation costs by (1) carefully choosing the timing and path of freight and/or (2) introducing consolidation points. Approaches are proposed that enable effective planning and operation of freight routing and scheduling for large-scale transportation networks. Chapter 2 presents solution approaches for a shipper pickup and delivery planning problem faced by many large retailers to move freight from suppliers to distribution centers. Each shipment is moved either direct via a LTL carrier or possibly consolidated with other shipments and moved by one or two FTL routes. When using a FTL carrier, the shipper takes advantage of contracted lane rates that establish prices per mile for a truck operated between two locations that are significantly less than the comparable LTL price for shipping a full truckload. Consolidated FTL routes may each visit <b>multiple</b> <b>shipment</b> origins (supplier locations) and/or destinations (distribution center locations). Additionally, FTL routes may move shipments through a single crossdock facility en route. The challenge in this planning problem is to exploit {{as much as possible}} negotiated truckload lane rates and to judiciously make use of routes through crossdock facilities to consolidate shipments. The primary contributions of this section are that (1) an interesting new problem variant is introduced to the field of transportation and logistics that is important in practice and (2) the solution approach demonstrates that exploiting knowledge of the problem and solution structure to cleverly select subsets of path variables for evaluation during each iteration of an integer programming based local search heuristic is effective on path-based routing models. Chapter 3 evaluates how to route each customer shipment through a sequence of transfer terminals in a LTL carrier network. At each terminal stop, a shipment is unloaded from an inbound trailer and reloaded onto an outbound trailer. A load plan determines the specific sequence of terminal transfers to be used for freight moving between each origin and destination. The design of the load plan determines the linehaul transportation and handling costs required to serve customers. We develop an improved very large-scale neighborhood search heuristic for solving an integer programming model for load plan design. The main contributions of this section include (1) the investigation of {{the pros and cons of}} optimizing system-wide into a single destination versus optimizing freight for all destinations in a small region, and (2) a solution approach that can find load plans with costs 6 to 7 % lower than those used in practice, and can find 2. 5 to 5 % additional cost savings using the same time budget when compared to an approach optimizing system-wide into a single destination. Chapter 4 addresses a strategic planning problem that extends the load plan design problem to consider terminal roles. We investigate two-stage approaches that first identify the set of transfer terminals and then develop the corresponding load plan. Computational results compare the terminals chosen as transfer facilities from the proposed integer programming based local search method with a traditional hub location formulation and a simple facility location formulation to depict the benefits gained from modeling additional information. The key contributions of this section are (1) the introduction of a new hub location problem variant incorporating freight dispatch timing and trailer transportation cost characteristics found in the LTL trucking industry and (2) a solution approach utilizing IP-based local search that demonstrates the importance of incorporating freight dispatch timing. Finally, Chapter 5 summarizes the main conclusions from this dissertation and discusses directions for further research.

40|$|This {{report is}} the final project of a student in ISR's 2008 Research Experiences for Undergraduates program. In {{a case of a}} bioterrorism attack, public health {{officials}} need to be prepared so the country, state, and counties are able to respond to any threat. The medication distribution problem specifically focuses on the state and local government levels of medication distribution to the points of dispensing (PODs). If health officials decide that mass dispensing of medication is needed, the PODs will be prepared as locations to administer the medication to the public. The state will then request medication from the federal government to be delivered to a state depot, where the medications will be stored until it is delivered to the PODs. The federal government will make <b>multiple</b> <b>shipments,</b> or waves, of medication to the depot. Likewise <b>multiple</b> <b>shipments</b> of medication will be made from the depot to the PODs. The health officials have two strategic alternatives in order to ensure timely deliveries are made to the PODs. 1. 	Using an LDC. A county may choose to operate a local distribution center (LDC) which receives medications from the depot. The LDC then distributes the materials to the PODs within the LDC’s jurisdiction. 2. 	Not using an LDC. The second strategic alternative for the counties is to forgo having an LDC so that the medication will be delivered from the depot directly to the PODs. Variable aspects of the problem include the routes used by the trucks to deliver the medication, the travel time of the trucks (travel time to the PODs and time to finish a route), time to load and unload the trucks, and the demand of medication per each POD. The best solution is determined by maximizing the probability that the PODs open on-time and do not run out of medication during operation. Assuming truck routes have already been determined, this paper addresses the scheduling aspect of mass medication distribution. The focus will be optimizing the schedules—deciding when a POD will receive a delivery and the amount of medication sent to the PODs during each delivery.

This unirradiated material consists primarily of ceramic pellets of thorium oxide in stainless steel cladding, but it also contains 300 kilograms of uranium that is 98 wt% U- 233.

40|$|The Internet has {{transformed}} {{the way in which}} we conduct business and perform economic and financial transactions. One key challenge of the Internet is the inefficiency of the mechanisms by which technology is deployed and the business and economic models surrounding these processes (Wolf et al. (2014)). Equilibrium models for the Internet generally assume basic economic relationships. However, in new paradigms for the Internet and in supply chain networks, price is not the only factor; quality of service (QoS) is also of increasing importance. Supply chains networks, which give us the means to manufacture products and deliver them to points of demand across the globe, are also under many pressures to offer differentiated products and services (Nagurney (2014)). It is well-known today that success is determined by how well the entire supply chain performs, rather than the performance of its individual entities. This dissertation contributes to the analysis, design, and management of the future Internet and supply chain networks with a focus on price and quality competition in service-oriented networks. Specifically, I focus on economic models for the Internet of the future by developing both a basic and a general network economic game theory model of a quality-based service-oriented Internet to study competition among service providers. To study and analyze the underlying dynamics of the various economic decision-makers, subsequently, I develop a dynamic network economic model of a service-oriented Internet with price and quality competition using projected dynamical systems theory. Then, to assess the prices for various contract durations at the demand markets, I consider a game theory model of a service-oriented Internet in which the network providers compete in usage service rates, quality levels, and duration-based contracts. Finally, I construct a model that captures the competition among manufacturers and freight service providers in a supply chain network. This model is the first one in the literature that handles both price and quality competition with <b>multiple</b> modes of <b>shipment</b> from both equilibrium and dynamic perspectives. For each model, I derive the governing equilibrium conditions and provide the equivalent variational inequality formulations. In order to illustrate the modeling framework and the algorithm, I present computed solutions to several numerical examples for each model as well as sensitivity analysis results. This dissertation is heavily based on the following papers: Saberi, Nagurney, and Wolf (2014), Nagurney et al. (2014 a), Nagurney et al. (2015 b), and Nagurney et al. (2015 a) as well as additional results and conclusions...|$|R
