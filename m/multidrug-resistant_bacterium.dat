30|$|Infections {{remain a}} major cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality worldwide despite the presence of a significant number of antibiotics and antiseptics. In moderate and severe infections, antibiotic therapy is usually initiated empirically before obtaining results of bacteriological examination. Constant use of antibiotics created favorable conditions for the selection and multiplication of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms [22]. High prevalence of multidrug resistance to agents of all infectious processes is documented nowadays [6]. The most notorious <b>multidrug-resistant</b> <b>bacterium</b> is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [9]. The pathogen is responsible for a broad spectrum of human and animal diseases ranging from the skin infections to such severe disorders as pneumonia, endocarditis, and septicemia, and these infections may impact human health [32]. Analysis of etiological causes of infections in patients with inadequate therapy revealed that therapy was inadequate in 32.6 % cases of MRSA-based infections [12] and associated with 3 – 4 billion US dollars in annual health care costs [32].|$|E
40|$|RecA is {{the major}} enzyme {{involved}} in homologous recombination and plays {{a central role in}} SOS mutagenesis. In Acinetobacter spp., including Acinetobacter baumannii, a <b>multidrug-resistant</b> <b>bacterium</b> responsible for nosocomial infections worldwide, DNA repair responses differ in many ways from those of other bacterial species. In this work, the function of A. baumannii RecA was examined by constructing a recA mutant. Alteration of this single gene had a pleiotropic effect, showing the involvement of RecA in DNA damage repair and consequently in cellular protection against stresses induced by DNA damaging agents, several classes of antibiotics, and oxidative agents. In addition, the absence of RecA decreased survival in response to both heat shock and desiccation. Virulence assays in vitro (with macrophages) and in vivo (using a mouse model) similarly implicated RecA in the pathogenicity of A. baumannii. Thus, the data strongly suggest a protective role for RecA in the bacterium and indicate that inactivation of the protein can contribute to a combined therapeutic approach to controlling A. baumannii infections...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increase}} of infections caused by <b>multidrug-resistant</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Paediatric data are scarce, particularly at national level. AIMS: To analyse trends of health-care associated <b>multidrug-resistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> infections in a paediatric hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective incidence study was conducted in medical, surgical and intensive care wards in a level III paediatric hospital, from January 2005 to December 2009. The studied <b>multidrug-resistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), ESBL-producing bacilli, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp, multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA-MDR) and Acinetobacter baumannii resistant to carbapenems. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data, treatment and presence of risk factors for these infections were analysed. RESULTS: During the study period 106 <b>multidrug-resistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> were identified, related to 72 children, predominantly male (65. 3 %). The most frequently identified <b>multidrug-resistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> were MRSA (35. 8 %), PA-MDR (29. 2 %) and ESBL-producing bacilli (17. 9 %). Of the 106 <b>multidrug-resistant</b> <b>bacteria,</b> 45 (42. 5 %) were causing infection. During the study period the annual proportion of infections caused by <b>multidrug-resistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> went up from 32. 0 % in 2006 to 55. 6 % in 2009 (p = 0. 376). The overall incidence rate of infection was 0. 400 per 1 000 hospitalization-days, corresponding to 0. 274 infections per 100 admissions, remaining stable over the five years. The most frequent infections were bloodstream (31. 1 %), intra-abdominal (20. 0 %), catheter-related (17. 8 %) and skin and soft tissue (11. 1 %). All children had risk factors and the most frequently identified were previous antibiotic therapy and underlying chronic disease (> 90 %). Six children (13. 3 %) died during hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: During the study period, there was an increase in the proportion of <b>multidrug-resistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> but with no statistical significance. The overall incidence rate of <b>multidrug-resistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> infection remained stable. MRSA were the most frequently identified bacteria, followed by PA-MDR and ESBL-producing bacilli. Bloodstream infections were the most frequent infections, followed by intra-abdominal and catheter-related.

The methodologies developed to inactivate A. baumannii genes are complicated and time-consuming; sometimes result in unstable mutants, {{and do not}} enable construction of double (or more) gene knockout mutant strains of A. baumannii. Results: We describe here a rapid and simple method of obtaining A. baumannii mutants by gene replacement via double crossover recombination, by use of a PCR product that carries an antibiotic resistance cassette flanked by regions homologous to the target locus. To demonstrate the reproducibility of the approach, we produced mutants of three different chromosomal genes (omp 33, oxyR, and soxR) by this method.

40|$|Abstract Background Knowledge of {{the burden}} of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) and {{antibiotic}} resistance is important for resource allocation in infection control. Although national surveillance networks do not routinely cover all HAIs due to <b>multidrug-resistant</b> <b>bacteria,</b> estimates are nevertheless possible: in the EU, 25, 000 patients die from such infections annually. We assessed the burden of HAIs due to <b>multidrug-resistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> in Finland in 2010. Methods By combining data from the National Infectious Disease Registry on the numbers of bacteremias caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., and susceptibility data from the National Antimicrobial Resistance Network and the Finnish Hospital Infection Program, we assessed the numbers of healthcare-associated bacteremias due to selected <b>multidrug-resistant</b> <b>bacteria.</b> We estimated the number of pneumonias, surgical site and urinary tract infections by applying the ratio of these infections in the first national prevalence survey for HAI in 2005. Attributable HAI mortality (3. 2 %) was also derived from the prevalence survey. Results The estimated annual number of the most common HAIs due to the selected <b>multidrug-resistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> was 2804 (530 HAIs per million), 6 % of all HAIs in Finnish acute care hospitals. The number of attributable deaths was 89 (18 per million).

40|$|Myroides odoratimimus is an aerobic, non-fermenting Gram-negative <b>multidrug-resistant</b> <b>bacterium</b> widely {{distributed}} in nature that rarely causes infections in immunocompromised patients. We recently {{described in a}} diabetic patient a case of recurrent calcaneal ulcer infection caused by a M. odoratimimus strain showing potential for biofilm formation. For the first time, we therefore evaluated the ability of M. odoratimimus to form biofilm under different pH values and glucose concentrations using an in vitro “skin-like” model, and its susceptibility to levofloxacin, meropenem, and tigecycline. The expression of some antibiotic-resistance related genes was also monitored by RT-PCR during planktonic-to-biofilm transition. Our results indicated that M. odoratimimus can produce relevant amounts of biofilm biomass, in a time-dependent manner, especially at acidic pH and regardless of glucose concentration tested. The comparative analysis of MIC and MBC values between planktonic and sessile cells showed that resistance to antibiotics increased during the planktonic-to-biofilm transition. Viable cell count indicated {{that none of the}} tested antibiotics were able to completely eradicate preformed biofilms, although meropenem and levofloxacin were the most active causing a significant, dose-independent, reduction of biofilm's viability, as also confirmed by microscopic analysis. RT-PCR showed that antibiotic-resistance related gyrA and acrB genes are over-expressed during the transition from planktonic to sessile (biofilm) lifestyle. Overall, our findings showed that M. odoratimimus can form relevant amounts of inherently antibiotic-resistant biofilm under conditions relevant to wound site, therefore suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of chronic ulcer infections...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objective: Klebsiella pneumoniae {{known as}} one of the most common causes of hospital-acquired infections and <b>multidrug-resistant</b> <b>bacterium.</b> The aim of this study was to {{determine}} the prevalence of antibiotic resistance among K. pneumoniae isolates from Kermanshah medical centers. Methods: A total of 165 clinical samples were studied and among them, 100 isolates of K. pneumoniae was confirmed by API- 20 E Kit. Antibiotic susceptibility was performed by disk diffusion method for ampicillin, cefazoline, gentamicin, tobramycin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefpodoxime, aztreonam, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Co-trimoxzazole). Multidrug resistance (MDR) was determined based on the resistance to three or more classes of antibiotics. The data were statistically analyzed. Results: The majority of isolates was from urinary tract infection (60 %). Isolates were resistant to ampicillin (98 %), cefazoline (59 %), Co-trimoxazole (58 %), ceftazidime (51 %), cefpodoxime (50 %), ceftriaxone (47 %), aztreonam 46 %, tobramycin (44 %), cefotaxime (41 %), ciprofloxacin (28 %), gentamicin (25 %), piperacillin-tazobactam (9 %), ertapenem 3 %, imipenem and meropenem (3 %). Fifty-six of the isolates were MDR. Conclusion: High prevalence of multidrug resistance in the region of Kermanshah represents the spread of resistance genes. Based on the results, one approach to prevent this trend is the treatment of K. pneumoniae infections according to the antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Our results suggest carbapenems are effective against resistant isolates. The rate of antibiotic resistance in K. pneumoniae isolates from hospitalized patients in Kermanshah is alarming...|$|E

40|$|Background: Pneumonia {{frequently}} affects solid {{organ transplant}} (SOT) recipients, with high morbidity and mortality. However, the few studies on pneumonia {{in this population}} are mainly retrospective, single-center, and long-term studies, or include patients with only one type of SOT or a specific etiology. We performed a point prevalence study to investigate epidemiology, diagnosis, therapy, and outcome of pneumonia in an unselected SOT population. Methods: Italian and Spanish transplant centers were invited to report on all SOT recipients with pneumonia treated during 2 separate weeks (1 each in February and June 2012). Results: In total, 35 centers (18 in Italy, 17 in Spain) agreed to participate and collected 54 cases. The incidence of pneumonia was 10. 1 episodes/ 1000 recipients/year. Pneumonia was classified as late (> 6 months) in 70. 4 % of cases. Pneumonia was also classified as community-acquired (CAP), healthcare-associated (HCAP), and hospital-acquired (HAP) pneumonia in 40. 7 %, 38. 9 %, and 20. 4 % of cases, respectively. An attempt to microbiological diagnosis (≥ 1 sample) was made in 94. 4 % of patients, with a diagnostic yield of 60. 7 %. Causative agents included bacteria (87. 1 %), virus (29 %), and fungi (6. 4 %). A <b>multidrug-resistant</b> <b>bacterium</b> was isolated in 18. 2 %, 40 %, and 100 % of patients with CAP, HCAP, and HAP (P = 0. 007), respectively.

40|$|During {{the past}} decade, {{the authors have}} {{collected}} a few X-ray diffraction data sets from protein crystals {{that appeared to be}} easy cases of molecular replacement but failed to yield structures even after extensive trials. Here, the use of a large-scale molecular replacement method that explores all structurally characterized domains as phasing models to determine the structure corresponding to two data sets collected at 1. 9 and 2. 3 angstrom resolution is reported. These two structures were of the same protein independently crystallized in 2007 and 2011. The structures derived are virtually identical and were found to consist of two compact globular domains connected by a hinge. The high resolution of one of these data sets enabled inference of the amino-acid sequence from the electron-density map. The deduced sequence is nearly identical to that of a protein from the <b>multidrug-resistant</b> <b>bacterium</b> Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Although the structure of this protein has not been determined previously, it is homologous to the well studied DING proteins which mediate the cellular uptake of phosphate ions. The final electron-density maps from both of the data sets revealed a large density at the interface of the two globular domains that is likely to represent a phosphate ion. Thus, the structure is likely to be that of a phosphate-binding protein encoded by the S. maltophilia genome (SmPBP; PDB entry 5 j 1 d). The nature of the phosphate-binding site of SmPBP closely resembles that of Pseudomonas fluorescens DING (PfluDING), which displays remarkable discrimination between the closely similar phosphate and arsenate ions.
