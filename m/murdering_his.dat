From Wooldridge's hanging, Wilde later wrote The Ballad of Reading Gaol.|$|E
5|$|Dungeons & Dragons {{has been}} the subject of rumors {{regarding}} players having difficulty separating fantasy from reality, even leading to psychotic episodes. The most notable of these was the saga of James Dallas Egbert III, the facts of which were fictionalized in the novel Mazes and Monsters and later made into a TV movie. The game was blamed for some of the actions of Chris Pritchard, who was convicted in 1990 of <b>murdering</b> <b>his</b> stepfather. Research by various psychologists, the first being that of Armando Simon, has concluded that no harmful effects are related to the playing of D.|$|E
50|$|Another tragedy he {{experienced}} {{was that in}} addition to <b>his</b> brother's <b>murder,</b> <b>his</b> father <b>murdered</b> <b>his</b> mother.

5|$|Hermes– The former God of Speed and Commerce, the Messenger of the Gods, and {{the father}} of Ceryx.

In God of War III, Hermes taunted Kratos about <b>murdering</b> <b>his</b> family during Kratos' assault on Mount Olympus, leading to a chase through the city of Olympia.

The character was voiced by Greg Ellis in God of War III.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, Crease {{presided over}} the trial of John Hall, who owned {{most of the land}} on Burrard Inlet that now makes up the {{community}} of Belcarra, British Columbia, and who was accused of <b>murdering</b> <b>his</b> mother in law. Hall and Crease had known each other for years, and Crease had once employed him as his agent in a dispute with trespassers who illegally logged on land he and his friend Robert Burnaby owned near Hall's ranch. Hall was found guilty of manslaughter, and his land signed over to his attorney to pay for his defence.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, Thompson brought another $600 million {{lawsuit against}} Cody Posey, Rockstar Games, Take-Two Interactive, and Sony Computer Entertainment. The lawsuit claimed that 14-year-old Posey {{played the game}} obsessively before <b>murdering</b> <b>his</b> father, stepmother, and stepsister on a ranch in Hondo, New Mexico. Posey's defense team argued that he was abused by his father and was taking Zoloft {{at the time of}} the killings. The suit alleged that the murders would not have taken place if Posey had not obsessively played Vice City. The case was {{dismissed}} in December 2007, as New Mexico held no jurisdiction over Sony or Take-Two.|$|E

Also, Susan (Teri Hatcher) meets a new man, Ian Hainsworth (Dougray Scott), while waiting for Mike (James Denton) to awaken from his coma.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} section of Eusebius' Historia on Philip's religious beliefs describes the emperor's {{visit to a}} church on Easter Eve when he was denied entry by the presiding bishop until he confessed his sins. The account is paralleled by Chrysostom's homily, which celebrates Saint Babylas, Bishop of Antioch, for denying a sinful emperor entry to his church; and quotations of Leontius in the Chronicon Paschale which describe Philip seeking penitence from Babylas for the sin of <b>murdering</b> <b>his</b> predecessor. Given the parallels between the accounts, most scholars believe that Eusebius, Chrysostom, and Leontius are referring to the same event (or legend).|$|E
5|$|Cleveland's {{service as}} sheriff was unremarkable; biographer Rexford Tugwell {{described}} {{the time in}} office as a waste for Cleveland politically. Cleveland was aware of graft in the sheriff's office during his tenure and chose not to confront it. A notable incident of his term took place on September 6, 1872, when Patrick Morrissey was executed, who {{had been convicted of}} <b>murdering</b> <b>his</b> mother. As sheriff, Cleveland was responsible for either personally carrying out the execution or paying a deputy $10 to perform the task. In spite of reservations about the hanging, Cleveland executed Morrissey himself; he hanged another murderer, John Gaffney, on February 14, 1873.|$|E

5|$|Hrithik Roshan {{plays the}} lead role of Vijay Deenanath Chauhan and Sanjay Dutt {{plays the role of}} the {{antagonist}} Kancha, originally played by Amitabh Bachchan and Danny Denzongpa respectively, with Rishi Kapoor portraying the newly introduced character of Rauf Lala. The supporting cast include Om Puri as Commissioner Gaitonde, Priyanka Chopra as Kaali Gawde and Zarina Wahab as Suhasini Chauhan, with Katrina Kaif featuring in an item number. The film follows the struggle of a common man, Vijay Chauhan, as he seeks revenge from Kancha, for wrongly framing and <b>murdering</b> <b>his</b> father in the island village of Mandwa. In the process he befriends an underworld drug lord Rauf Lala and {{falls in love with a}} loquacious girl, Kaali Gawde.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{because of}} her {{traumatic}} childhood, Sidle has demonstrated compassion and empathy for victims of domestic violence, and fury against their abusers. She also has {{a soft spot for}} animals, and became a vegetarian after she saw Grissom conduct an experiment on a dead pig. She has also shown a tendency to become very aggressive when under pressure or annoyed, especially in cases involving abused women - such as her arguments with Catherine and Ecklie, and engaging in a heated argument with a man suspected of <b>murdering</b> <b>his</b> wife. In recent years, perhaps {{because of her}} mother's schizophrenia, she has been seen to work several cases with a mental health aspect.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} motive is also explored. When confronting Padgett, Mulder asks {{him why he}} is <b>murdering</b> <b>his</b> victims. Padgett, in turn, admits that he cannot answer the question. Kaner {{suggests}} that Padgett is representative of a version of Mulder, {{and that there is}} a direct parallel between being a criminal profiler—who must think like the criminal—and a writer—who must think like his characters. In the end, however, Padgett sacrifices his personal quest—his manuscript—in order to be free. This presents a distinct contrast to Mulder, who will never truly give up his obsession. Michelle Bush, in her book Myth-X, also notes that the episode sheds light on Scully's motive throughout the series: she wants to gain Mulder's attention, something she feels she does not have. Padgett eventually realizes this, and sacrifices himself for her love.|$|E

Gyges was given the choice of killing Candaules for his instigation of the plot, or of his own suicide; he reluctantly chose to save his own life by <b>murdering</b> <b>his</b> master. The next night, Gyges hid behind the same door from which he had watched the naked Nyssia, and stabbed Candaules while he slept, taking Nyssia as his own wife and declaring himself King of Lydia. The Delphic Oracle confirmed Gyges as king, as {{the first of the}} Mermnad dynasty, and he reigned for 38 years.|$|E
5|$|While {{practicing}} law at Lafayette he represented Adam Wimple of neighboring Polk County after Wimple {{had been charged}} for <b>murdering</b> <b>his</b> wife. Deady represented him at trial and was to receive as payment Wimple’s land claim via his will. Wimple was convicted of the murder and sentenced to death, but was only hung after being recaptured from a jail break. In 1852, Deady was among many legal minds and politicians in the territory such as Joseph C. Avery and Robert Moore that signed a petition asking Governor John P. Gaines to pardon Nimrod O'Kelly after O'Kelly's controversial conviction for murder. O'Kelly was eventually spared from the gallows.|$|E
5|$|Bojić devoted {{most of his}} {{creative}} energy to the completion of an epic poem titled Cain, which was published just before the combined Austro-Hungarian, Bulgarian and German invasion of Serbia in October 1915. A deeply patriotic work, Cain compares Bulgaria's impending attack on Serbia to the Biblical story of Cain jealously <b>murdering</b> <b>his</b> brother Abel. Upon capturing Niš, the Bulgarians burned every copy of the poem, {{and the only one}} that survived was the one that Bojić carried with him out of the city. Upon leaving Niš, Bojić and his brother Radivoje joined the Serbian Army in its retreat to the Adriatic coast. Their sisters and infant brother went to live with a cousin in occupied Kraljevo. The Bojić brothers' journey took them through Kuršumlija, Mitrovica, Pristina, Prizren, Đakovica, Dečani and Peć, from where they continued to Andrijevica and Podgorica. The two intended to join retreating Montenegrin Army columns and head on to Scutari, where they hoped that Allied ships would evacuate them and other Serbian troops to Italy.|$|E
