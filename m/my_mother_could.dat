6000|$|... "As well, please your Highness, as <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> take up {{a stitch}} in the nets she wove. The Milaner shall not know my work from his own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had to be}} born somewhere. It was a great ranch, <b>my</b> <b>mother's.</b> You <b>could</b> put all Oakland {{in one of its}} {{smallest}} pastures." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say {{no more of}} this, Eve; it is {{unpleasant}} to me. I {{hate the}} name of Assheton, though it was <b>my</b> <b>mother's,</b> and <b>could</b> wish never to hear it again." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "My genesis famous land of Sinlung, Land of <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and father; <b>Could</b> it {{be called}} back like Chongzil, Land of <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} {{be seen in the}} street with that scarecrow," [...] murmured Giles. [...] "If <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> have guessed that he was to be set over me, I had never come here." ...|$|E
60|$|They disputed and disputed, and I was {{the very}} center of subject of it all, and I wished <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> know that this grand honor had come to me; it would have made her proud.|$|E
6000|$|... "Him! Well, did you {{see what}} he did, mum? Walked {{straight}} into my clean kitchen, without even wiping his boots, the--" [...] And before <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> stop her, Janet had relieved her feelings by calling him it--or rather them--again, without any idea that she had done aught else than express in fitting phraseology a natural human emotion.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Otherwise,' said <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> 'I <b>could</b> {{bring about}} the {{marriage}} with the little Chevalier. Annora has renounced her disobedient folly, and would make no more resistance; but M. de Poligny, of course, cannot proceed further till your brother is in condition to settle the property on her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A sound I heard {{once before}} in my life--at the deathbed of <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> I <b>could</b> not {{identify}} it--though I recognized it. Then the dog howled: you remarked it. I {{did not think it}} worth while to tell you what I had heard a little earlier.' She looked agonized.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it--I know--I know!" [...] {{she gasped}} through her sobs. [...] "But, O <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> I <b>could</b> not help it! He was so good--and I felt the wickedness {{of trying to}} blind him as to what had happened! If--if--it were to be done again--I should do the same. I could not--I dared not--so sin--against him!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear lady," [...] he said, [...] "she's {{a person}} you never {{ought to have}} had inside your house. She's promised me to be gone in half an hour, and I'm coming back to see she keeps her word. Give her a month's wages, and have a clear fire ready for me." [...] And before <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> reply, he had slammed the front door.|$|E
60|$|On {{returning}} to the yacht, we found poor Nicholas in deep distress. He had received a letter announcing {{the death of his}} father, and requiring his immediate return to Russia. As the circumstances admitted of no delay, and as <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> not be prevailed on to go farther in the yacht, it was hastily arranged that she and Bella should return through France to England, and that Nicholas should take charge of them.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are right, D'Arnot," [...] replied Tarzan, [...] "for if Kerchak {{had come}} to Tublat's aid {{that night at the}} Dum-Dum, there would have been an end of me. But Kerchak could never think far enough ahead to take {{advantage}} of any such opportunity. Even Kala, <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>could</b> never plan ahead. She simply ate what she needed when she needed it, and if the supply was very scarce, even though she found plenty for several meals, she would never gather any ahead.|$|E
6000|$|LESLIE. What is my honour {{but your}} happiness? In what else does it consist? Is it in denying me my heart? {{is it in}} visiting another's sin upon the innocent? Could I do that, and be <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> son? <b>Could</b> I do that, and bear my father's name? Could I do that, and have ever been found worthy of you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Besides all, {{he had an}} overseer,--great, tall, slab-sided, two-fisted renegade son of Vermont--(begging your pardon),--who {{had gone}} through a regular {{apprenticeship}} in hardness and brutality and taken his degree {{to be admitted to}} practice. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> never <b>could</b> endure him, nor I; but he obtained an entire ascendency over my father; and this man was the absolute despot of the estate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then if {{the other}} things they told me are true, Chebron, {{it may be true}} too that the letter they showed me {{ordering}} me to consent to marry Plexo was from <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> How <b>could</b> she tell me that when she knew that I hated him, and she has over and over again spoken scornfully of his family before me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> hardly endure {{to receive}} any one, {{but she seemed}} glad to see my father become {{animated}} and like himself while Roman Catholic Emancipation was vehemently discussed, and the ruin of England hotly predicted. Clarence moped about silently as usual, and tried to avoid notice, {{and it was not}} till the next morning-- after breakfast, when the two gentlemen were in the dining-room, nearly ready to go their several ways, and I was in the window awaiting my classical tutor--that Mr. Castleford said, ...|$|E
60|$|My {{father had}} been a man past forty when he married my mother. She about fifteen years younger--a slim, nimble, and lovely being, who could slip round and {{encircle}} him in person or mind while he was pondering whether or not to say Bo to a goose. Seven years afterwards came I. Friends, as friends will, professed to see a likeness between us. And if <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> have been dwindled down to be of my height and figure, perhaps they would have been justified.|$|E
60|$|Ah, if I {{could tell}} you the glow of pride which it gave me {{to be taken into}} the great man's {{confidence}} in this way. As he handed our letters to us I clicked my spurs and threw out my chest, smiling and nodding to let him know that I saw what he would be after. He smiled also, and rested his hand for a moment upon the cape of my dolman. I would have given half my arrears of pay if <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> have seen me at that instant.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know why}} I left you, father; and I {{had reason to}} {{distrust}} you, because I felt sure that you had deceived <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> If I <b>could</b> have trusted you, I would have stayed with you and worked for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|He hesitated again. Miss Minerva understood. [...] "Yes," [...] she answered; [...] "I {{spoke to}} Ovid of his mother. In mercy {{to himself and}} to me, he would hear no details. 'I know enough,' he said, 'if I know {{that she is the}} person to blame. I was {{prepared}} to hear it. <b>My</b> <b>mother's</b> silence <b>could</b> only be accounted for in one way, when I had read Zo's letter.'--Don't you know, Mr. Gallilee, that the child wrote to Ovid?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> poor <b>mother</b> never <b>could</b> {{endure the}} name of M. Darpent, {{because she did not}} like my brother's {{friendship}} with any one not noble, but she was as glad to see him then {{as if he had been}} a Montmorency or a Coucy.|$|R
60|$|Sir Francis {{told us that}} Madame Darpent was, 'after your French fashion,' as he said, {{receiving}} visits of condolence in her bed, and, {{considering how}} good and obliging {{the young man had}} been, he supposed we should pay one. Annora's eyes shone, but to my surprise she said nothing, and I was quite ready to consent, since I too felt under such obligations to the younger Darpent that I could let no scruple about condescension stand in my way, and I was glad that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> not hear of it until after it was done.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not that. I don't think {{anything}} but fuss and worry {{would have come}} of it then. I was only fifteen, and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> never have let it go on, and even if-â€”; but what I am so grieved and ashamed at is my fancying him not enough of a man for such a self-sufficient ape as I was. And now I have seen more of the world, and know what men are, I see his generosity, and that his patient fight with ill-health to do his best and his duty, is really very great and good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, if we could!' said Annaple. 'Ronald {{is doing}} so well in New Zealand, but I don't think <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> spare me. She could not come out, and she must be with me, {{wherever}} I am. You know--don't you--that I am seven years younger than Alick. I was a regular surprise, and the old nurse at Ronnisglen said 'Depend upon it, my Leddy, she is given to be the comfort of your old age.' And I have always {{made up my mind}} never to leave her. I don't think she would get on with Janet or any of them without me, so you'll have to take her too, Mark.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{ran away}} from school,' replied Arthur, colouring. 'I was a mere boy, and I never was attainted,' {{explained}} Arthur, blushing. 'I have been with my Lord Nithsdale, and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> thought I <b>could</b> safely come home, and that if I came from Sweden my brother could not think I compromised him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't invite her, {{and when}} we came back from London I didn't know she was here. No one invited her. She's a friend of <b>my</b> <b>mother's,</b> and just after you and I went to town <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> got a note from her. She had arrived in England (she usually lives abroad, though she has first and last {{spent a good deal of}} time here), and asked leave to come down for a few days. She's a woman who can make such {{proposals}} with perfect confidence; she's so welcome wherever she goes. And with <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> there <b>could</b> be no question of hesitating; she's the one person in the world whom <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> very much admires. If she were not herself (which she after all much prefers), she would like to be Madame Merle. It would indeed be a great change." ...|$|R
5000|$|... singing {{has become}} {{the love of my}} life - I don't have deep regrets about not marrying or having children, but I do regret that I never trained as an opera singer like <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> If I <b>could</b> trade my title for the chance to work as a {{professional}} opera singer I'd do it like a shot.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> {{speak to}} me,' said Louis, with {{trembling}} lips, 'she would surely bid {{me to try}} my utmost, as far as in me lies, to bring peace and happiness to my father. I cannot tell where the errors may have been, and I will never ask. If she was as like to me as they say, I could understand some of them! At least, I know that I am doubly bound to give as little vexation to him as possible, and I trust {{that you will not}} make it harder to me. You lost your father so early, that you can hardly estimate--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{stared at}} the {{watercresses}} doubtfully for a while, and at last seized a handful and crammed them into his mouth, crying out as he did so, 'Oh, why was I born that I should live to feed on green weeds like an ox? Surely if <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> have known it she would have killed me when I was born!' and so he went on lamenting between each fistful of watercresses till all were finished, when he declared that he was full indeed of stuff, but it lay very cold on his stomach, 'like snow upon a mountain.' At any other time I should have laughed, for it must be admitted he had a ludicrous way of putting things. Zulus do not like green food.|$|E
60|$|My height {{was a great}} {{trouble to}} me in those unformed days. I had so much more length to dispose of than my neighbours, and I knew they remarked me the more for it; and then my hair never would remain in curl {{for half an hour}} together. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> put it up safely, but since I had left her it was always coming down, like flax from a distaff; and though I had in general a tolerably fresh and rosy complexion, heat outside and {{agitation}} within made my whole face, nose and all, instantly become the colour of a clove gillyflower. It had so become every afternoon on the journey, and I knew I was growing redder and redder every moment, and that I should put him, my own dear Viscount, to shame before his aunt.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{why is it}} necessary," [...] said Edmund, [...] "that Crawford's carriage, or his only, {{should be}} employed? Why is no use {{to be made of}} <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> chaise? I <b>could</b> not, when the scheme was first {{mentioned}} the other day, understand why a visit from the family were not {{to be made in the}} carriage of the family." ...|$|R
60|$|VIVIE. Yes. Fifty pounds. Perhaps {{you don't}} {{know how it}} was. Mrs Latham, my tutor at Newnham, told <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> that I <b>could</b> {{distinguish}} myself in the mathematical tripos if I went in for it in earnest. The papers were full just then of Phillipa Summers beating the senior wrangler. You remember about it, of course.|$|R
60|$|I could {{repeat this}} in my mind too, but I had not the least idea what it meant. I saw before me, lying on the step, {{the mother of the}} dead child. She lay there with one arm {{creeping}} round a bar of the iron gate and seeming to embrace it. She lay there, who had so lately spoken to <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> She lay there, a distressed, unsheltered, senseless creature. She who had brought <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> letter, who <b>could</b> give me the only clue to where <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was; she, who was to guide us to rescue and save her whom we had sought so far, who had come to this condition by some means connected with <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> that I <b>could</b> not follow, and might be passing beyond our reach and help at that moment; she lay there, and they stopped me! I saw but did not comprehend the solemn and compassionate look in Mr. Woodcourt's face. I saw but did not comprehend his touching the other on the breast to keep him back. I saw him stand uncovered in the bitter air, with a reverence for something. But my understanding for all this was gone.|$|R
