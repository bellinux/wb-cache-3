40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{application}} of optimization techniques to the determination of aircraft light test input maneuvers for aircraft model identification and aerodynamic parameter estimation. The optimum flight test maneuvers are necessary {{to increase the efficiency}} of aircraft identification and parameter estimation algorithms, respecting operational restrictions related to flight safety and limits of the assumed mathematical models. In this work we compare the effectiveness of identification processes obtained with conventional aircraft maneuvers and maneuvers defined by a special optimization procedure. In both cases, the increase of the efficiency of the estimation algorithms uses the maximization of sensitivity of output equations to the parameters of the model. For the conventional <b>maneuver</b> <b>signals,</b> however, this is made in an indirect form, by shaping the input signals in a way to increase the power spectral density of the signals in the range of the natural frequencies of the dynamic system of interest. The optimization technique, on the other hand is based on the concept of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) where the sensitivity matrix and Cramer-Rao lower bounds are used to compose the optimization criteria and to generate an optimal signal that minimizes the uncertainties related with the estimation of the aerodynamic parameters. One case study is discussed with the use of lateraldirectional dynamic models of a jet aircraft. The advantages and disadvantages of the proposed maneuvers are presented, stressing the easiness of implementation of the signals and the strong improvement made possible with the application of the optimized <b>maneuver</b> <b>signals.</b> Considerations and recommendations are regarding the importance of parameter estimation flight test maneuver...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{optimization}} of flight-test maneuvers for aerodynamic parameter estimation considering that the measurements are contaminated with colored residuals. The colored residuals consideration is important to give a direct and realistic assessment of the parameter estimation uncertainty levels before flight testing. The design technique {{is based on the}} optimization of the flight-test data information content and the Cramer–Rao lower bound. The discrete autocorrelation matrix of the measurement residuals is also used to compose the optimization criterion, thereby explicitly considering colored residuals. To validate the proposed technique, a flight-test campaign of the CEA- 205 CB- 9 Curumim was performed and its results discussed. The advantages of the proposed maneuver optimization technique are presented, stressing the ease of implementation of the signals and the strong improvement in the estimation procedures made possible with the application of the optimized <b>maneuver</b> <b>signals...</b>|$|R

40|$|Particle approximations {{are used}} to track a <b>maneuvering</b> <b>signal</b> given only a noisy, {{corrupted}} sequence of observations, as are encountered in target tracking and surveillance. The signal exhibits nonlinearities that preclude the optimal use of a Kalman filter. It obeys a stochastic differential equation (SDE) in a seven-dimensional state space, one dimension {{of which is a}} discrete maneuver type. The maneuver type switches as a Markov chain and each maneuver identifies a unique SDE for the propagation of the remaining six state parameters. Observations are constructed at discrete time intervals by projecting a polygon corresponding to the target state onto two dimensions and incorporating the noise. A new branching particle filter is introduced and compared with two existing particle filters. The filters simulate a large number of independent particles, each of which moves with the stochastic law of the target. Particles are weighted, redistributed, or branched, depending on the method of lte [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Link layer {{controllers}} for the AVHS architecture {{proposed in}} PATH are derived using vehicle conservation flow models. Control laws are developed for three highway topologies: a single lane highway, a highway with multiple discrete lanes and a highway with an arbitrary 2 dimensional flow pattern. The control laws obtained {{for each of}} the topologies is distributed and is very suited for implementation at the lower levels of the AVHS control hierarchy. Simulation results are described. 1. Introduction The current Automated Vehicle and Highway System (AVHS) architecture proposed in the California PATH project [10] consists of five hierarchical layers: (Fig. 1) : the network layer, the link layer, the coordination (planning) layer, the regulation layer and the physical layer.

40|$|The reduced-gravity {{environment}} in space {{is known to}} cause an upward shift in body fluids and thus require cardiovascular adaptations in astronauts. In this study, we recorded in rats the neuronal activity in the subthalamic cerebrovasodilator area (SVA), a key area that controls cerebral blood flow (CBF), in response to partial gravity. “Partial gravity” is the term that defines the reduced-gravity levels between 1 g (the unit gravity acceleration on Earth) and 0 g (complete weightlessness in space). Neuronal activity was recorded telemetrically through chronically implanted microelectrodes in freely moving rats. Graded levels of partial gravity from 0. 4 g to 0. 01 g were generated by customized parabolic-flight <b>maneuvers.</b> Electrophysiological <b>signals</b> in each partial-gravity phase were compared {{to those of the}} preceding 1 g level-flight. As a result, SVA neuronal activity was significantly inhibited by the partial-gravity levels of 0. 15 g and lower, but not by 0. 2 g and higher. Gravity levels between 0. 2 – 0. 15 g could represent a critical threshold for the inhibition of neurons in the rat SVA. The lunar gravity (0. 16 g) might thus trigger neurogenic mechanisms of CBF control. This is the first study to examine brain electrophysiology with partial gravity as an experimental parameter...|$|R
5000|$|The last stunt {{scheduled}} for filming was a nighttime spin, initially {{to take place}} in daylight with cameras fitted with red filters to simulate darkness. Locklear, under a lot of pressure, with not only his family life being in upheaval but also learning that studio head William Fox was not going to extend his contract beyond one film, demanded that he be allowed to fly at night. The studio relented, and on August 2, 1920, publicity surrounding the stunt led to a large crowd gathering to witness the filming of the unusual stunt. Large studio arc lights were set up on DeMille Field 2 to illuminate the Curtiss [...] "Jenny", to be doused as the aircraft entered its final spin. The dive towards some oil derricks was to make it appear that the airplane crashed beside the oil well. As arranged, Locklear had forewarned the lighting crew to douse their lights when he got near the derricks so that he could see {{to pull out of the}} dive, saying that [...] "When you take the lights off, I'll know where I am and I can come out of it." [...] After completing a series of aerial <b>maneuvers,</b> Locklear <b>signaled</b> that he would descend.|$|R
40|$|The present review {{summarizes}} the experimental and clinical {{evidence for the}} anti-ischemic action of the selective bradycardic agent ivabradine. Improvements in myocardial blood flow and contractile function during experimental myocardial ischemia and the clinical anti-anginal effect are largely mediated by heart rate reduction. However, {{a significant reduction in}} infarct size by ivabradine persists in the absence of heart rate reduction, and such protection can also be recruited when ivabradine is given only during early reperfusion. The mechanisms for such pleiotropic action of ivabradine remain to be resolved.

50|$|Although {{impact with}} the Moon {{was no longer}} possible, Ranger 3 could still be used for deep-space studies. Commands were issued to unfurl the camera boom and on the 28th, a fixed-up {{computer}} program was uploaded. But midway through this <b>maneuver,</b> the probe's <b>signal</b> strength began to weaken and the computer system completely failed. The TV camera transmitted images, but as the antenna was now pointed away from Earth, they were extremely weak and noisy. It was possible to see the reference crosses on the camera lens, illuminated by reflected sunlight from the probe's chassis, but the Moon was not visible. With the computer dead, Ranger 3 became completely unresponsive to any ground commands and the earth and sun sensors were rendered useless. The gyroscopes continued to maneuver the probe and ground controllers momentarily reacquired a lock on the antenna, but without stable attitude control, they could not hold it steady. As they were unaware of the computer failure, they continued sending commands to Ranger 3 in vain. Sporadic tracking of the probe continued until January 31 when the attitude control thrusters exhausted their propellant supply, {{at which point the}} mission was officially terminated.|$|R
40|$|On October 5 and 6, 1991, three dual-frequency ingress radio {{occultation}} experiments were conducted at Venus during consecutive orbits of the Magellan spacecraft. The radio signals probed {{a region of}} the atmosphere near 65 deg N, with a solar zenith angle of 108 deg, reaching below 35 km at 3. 6 cm, and below 34 km at 13 cm (above a mean radius of 6052 km). The high effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of the Magellan spacecraft and highly successful attitude <b>maneuvers</b> allowed these <b>signals</b> to probe deeper than any previous {{radio occultation}} experiment and also resulted in the most accurate thermal and sulfuric acid vapor abundance profiles ever obtained at Venus through radio occultation techniques. The performance of the spacecraft and the experiment design are discussed in an accompanying paper. Average electron density profiles retrieved from the data possess peaks between 2600 and 6000 /cu cm, well below typical values of 10, 000 /cu cm retrieved in 1979 by Pioneer Venus at similar solar zenith angles. Other basic results include vertical profiles of temperature, pressure, and density in the neutral atmosphere, 13 - and 3. 6 -cm absorpttivity, and H 2 SO 4 (g) abundance below the main cloud layer. H 2 SO 4 (g) becomes significant below 50 km, reaching peaks between 18 and 24 ppm near 39 km before dropping precipitously below 38 km. These sharp decreases confirm the thermal decomposition of sulfuric acid vapor below 39 km. Since the Venus atmosphere rotated approximately 10 deg between experiments, the data contain information about the horizontal variability of the atmosphere. All derived profiles exhibit significant variations from orbit to orbit, indicating the presence of dynamical processes between 33 and 200 km. In particular, the orbit-to-orbit variations in temperature and in H 2 SO 4 (g) abundance appear to be correlated, suggesting that a common mechanism {{may be responsible for}} the observed spatial variations...|$|R
