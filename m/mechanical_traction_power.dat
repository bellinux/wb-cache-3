30|$|Unlike the {{traditional}} <b>traction</b> <b>power</b> supply system which enables the electrified railway traction substation {{to be connected}} to power grid in a way of phase rotation, a new generation <b>traction</b> <b>power</b> supply system without phase splits is proposed in this paper. Three key techniques used in this system have been discussed. First, a combined co-phase <b>traction</b> <b>power</b> supply system is applied at traction substations for compensating negative sequence current and eliminating phase splits at exits of substations; design method and procedure for this system are presented. Second, a new bilateral <b>traction</b> <b>power</b> supply technology is proposed to eliminate the phase split at section post and reduce the influence of equalizing current on the power grid. Meanwhile, power factor should be adjusted to ensure a proper voltage level of the traction network. Third, a segmental power supply technology of traction network is used to divide the power supply arms into several segments, and the synchronous measurement and control technology is applied to diagnose faults and their locations quickly and accurately. Thus, the fault impact can be limited to a minimum degree. In addition, the economy and reliability of the new generation <b>traction</b> <b>power</b> supply system are analyzed.|$|R
40|$|Background Carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} (CTS) {{is a common}} condition (prevalence of 4 %) where the median nerve is compressed within the carpal tunnel resulting in numbness, tingling, and pain in the hand. Current non-surgical treatment options (oral medication, corticosteroid injections, splinting, exercise, and mobilization) show limited effects, especially in the long-term. Carpal tunnel release (CTR) surgery is effective in 70 to 75 % of patients, but is relatively invasive and can be accompanied by complications. In an observational study, <b>mechanical</b> <b>traction</b> proved {{to be effective in}} up to 70 % of patients directly after treatment and in 60 % after two years follow-up. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will examine the effectiveness of <b>mechanical</b> <b>traction</b> compared to care as usual in CTS. Methods/Design Patients diagnosed with CTS will be recruited from an outpatient neurology clinic and randomly assigned to the intervention group (<b>mechanical</b> <b>traction)</b> or the control group (care as usual). Participants in the intervention group will receive 12 treatments with <b>mechanical</b> <b>traction</b> during six consecutive weeks. Primary outcome is symptom severity and functional status, which are measured with the Boston Carpel Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ). Secondary outcomes are quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF), health related resource utilization, and absenteeism from work. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, and at 3, 6, and 12 months after inclusion. Linear mixed effect models will be used to determine the change from baseline at 12 months on the BCTQ, WHOQOL-BREF, absenteeism from work and health related resource utilization. The baseline measurement, change from baseline at three and six months, as well as duration of symptoms until inclusion, age, gender, and co-morbidity will be included as covariates The Pearson’s correlation coefficient will be generated to assess the correlation between depression and anxiety and treatment outcome. Discussion Since current non-surgical treatment options are not effective long-term and CTR is relatively invasive, {{there is a need for}} an effective and non-invasive treatment option. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>traction</b> is a safe treatment option that may provide a good alternative for the usual care. Considering the prevalence of CTS, the study is of great clinical value to a large patient population.

40|$|The Norwegian <b>traction</b> <b>power</b> {{system is}} a 15 kV {{single-phase}} 16 2 / 3 Hz <b>power</b> system. The <b>traction</b> <b>power</b> system is mainly supplied by rotary frequency converters that convert three-phase 50 Hz power from the utility grid to single-phase 16 2 / 3 Hz power. In recent times, static frequency converters (power electronic converters) have also been introduced. Parts of the <b>traction</b> <b>power</b> system are quite weak; consisting of long, radial lines with high impedance. Since the 1990 s, the introduction of advanced rail vehicles has revealed a poorly damped eigenmode around 1. 6 Hz in the rotary converters used to supply power to the system. In weak parts of the <b>traction</b> <b>power</b> system, the advanced rail vehicles can excite this eigenmode with their fast control systems, creating low frequency voltage oscillations in the <b>traction</b> <b>power</b> system. This thesis presents the work in investigating whether the static converters in the <b>traction</b> <b>power</b> system {{could be used to}} dampen low frequency oscillations and stabilise the <b>traction</b> <b>power</b> system. A central part of the work is the developing a model of a static converter in the PSCAD/EMTDC software, including a control system. For the purpose of recreating the low frequency oscillation problem, a rotary converter is also modelled, modifying synchronous machine models in the PSCAD model library. The <b>traction</b> <b>power</b> system is synchronised with the 50 Hz utility grid, so a control algorithm governing the frequency and phase angle of the static converter is implemented in the static converter control system, to allow both the static converter and rotary converter model to maintain synchronism and operate in parallel. An existing advanced rail vehicle model developed in [4] and implemented in PSCAD in [8] is also added, forming a small model of a <b>traction</b> <b>power</b> system. The model of a static converter, rotary converter and advanced rail vehicle are combined to form a test-bench to study the how the static converter control system can be used to mitigate the low frequency oscillation problem. A Power Oscillation Damping (POD) controller is implemented in the static converter's control system and tested. The static converter is found to provide extra stability to the <b>traction</b> <b>power</b> system when interconnected with a rotary converter, compared to situations were only rotary converters are present in the system, or worse, when a rotary converter operates in stand-alone mode. Implementation of a POD controller was also found to be effective in adding additional damping to the low frequency oscillations, but also revealed potential negative interaction issues with advanced rail vehicles. </p...|$|R
