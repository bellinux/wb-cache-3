The basic requirement is that no single failure can result in dangerous voltage becoming exposed so that it might cause an electric shock and that if a fault occurs the supply will be removed automatically (this is {{sometimes referred to as}} ADS = Automatic Disconnection of Supply).|$|E
50|$|A power cord, line cord, or <b>mains</b> <b>cable</b> is an {{electrical}} cable that temporarily connects an appliance to the mains electricity supply via a wall socket or extension cord. The terms are generally used for cables using a power plug to connect to a single-phase alternating current power source at the local line voltage - (generally 100 to 240 volts, depending on the location). The terms power cable, mains lead, flex or kettle lead are also used. A lamp cord (also known as a zip cord) is a light-weight, ungrounded, single-insulated two-wire cord used for small loads such as a table or floor lamp.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the needed {{analysis for the}} use of Aluminium conductors {{as an alternative to the}} use of copper in 1 -kV armoured and non-armoured cable network applications in Nigeria. The study revealed that over the years, copper cables have dominated the Nigeria cable market, except for bare Aluminium conductors (AOHL) and service cables (NAY and NAYY). The use of Aluminium as a conductor material has reached a great development due to its mechanical and electrical characteristics, in addition to the economic advantage over other metals used as conductors. The specification of its properties is expressed in the same units employed for other materials in order to appreciate its application as compared to other conductors.

50|$|The vast {{majority}} of bass amps in the 2010s can be powered solely by AC mains power, obtained by plugging the amp into a wall socket. Inexpensive practice amps may have the AC mains plug hardwired into the unit. Middle-priced to high-priced amplifiers typically have a removable cable and plug, as used with PC computer towers. The benefits of having a removable cable and plug {{is that if the}} cable becomes worn or damaged, a new cable can easily be replaced by a layperson. If a hardwired AC <b>mains</b> <b>cable</b> and plug becomes worn or damaged, a qualified technician or electrician will typically be required to replace the cable and plug. Most amps are designed to work for a single voltage. A small number of expensive bass amps designed for touring professionals have user-selectable voltage, which enables a bassist to play with same amp in North America and Europe. A small number of small combo amps can run on both AC mains power and battery power. This enables bassists to play outside where there is no access to power (e.g., for busking on the street). Amps that are battery powered may have a 12 volt input, enabling the unit to be connected to a car battery with alligator clips.|$|E
