40|$|This thesis explores whether {{corporate}} insiders exhibit trading {{patterns that}} would suggest that they exploit any potential information advantages they may have over other market participants. Furthermore, we consider information asymmetries between different types of insiders by comparing abnormal net sales between <b>managers</b> <b>and</b> non-managing insiders, between top-level <b>managers</b> <b>and</b> low-level <b>managers,</b> <b>and</b> between financial <b>managers</b> <b>and</b> non-financial <b>managers.</b> We show that managers have higher abnormal net sales than non-managing insiders, <b>and</b> that top-level <b>managers</b> have higher abnormal net sales than low-level managers prior to lawsuit announcements. We find a significant negative correlation between abnormal stock returns and abnormal net sales by <b>managers</b> <b>and</b> by top-level <b>managers.</b> Our evidence suggests that managers may engage in net selling {{in anticipation of the}} negative stock returns that are typically associated with securities class action announcements. In particular, high-rank insiders appear to place more profitable trades than low-rank insiders prior to lawsuit announcements...|$|R

Results also show that the quality of fund stewardship, as reflected by fund board quality, corporate culture, manager compensation, regulatory history, and fees are effective in ensuring that fund <b>managers</b> <b>and</b> boards perform their fiduciary obligation by increasing monitoring of the fund investment style...|$|R

40|$|Gender-centred {{perspectives}} of women <b>managers</b> <b>and</b> {{women in general}} characterise them as being more intuitive than male <b>managers</b> <b>and</b> men in general. Evidence for gender differences in cognitive style was sought by administering the Cognitive Style Index, a measure of intuition analysis, to three UK samples of <b>managers</b> <b>and</b> three UK samples of non-managers. Results indicate {{that there is no}} difference between female <b>and</b> male <b>managers</b> in terms of intuitive orientation, that female non-managers are more analytical (less intuitive) than male non-managers and more analytical than female managers. This lack of support for stereotypic characterisation of women <b>managers</b> <b>and</b> women in general as being more intuitive than their male equivalents is discussed within the context of structural and gendered cultural perspectives on behaviour in organisation...|$|R

5|$|As part of baseball's {{expansion}} in the early 1960s, a franchise was awarded to New York, {{to play in the}} National League beginning in 1962, and {{to be known as the}} New York Mets. It was hoped that the new team would be supported by the many former Giant and Dodger fans left without a team when the franchises moved to California after the 1957 season. There were rumors through the 1961 season that Stengel would be the manager, but he initially showed no interest in managing a team that, given the rules for the expansion draft, was unlikely to be competitive. George Weiss had been forced out as Yankee general <b>manager</b> <b>and</b> hired by the Mets. He wanted Stengel as <b>manager,</b> <b>and</b> after talks with the Mets principal owners, Joan Whitney Payson and M. Donald Grant, Stengel was introduced as Mets manager at a press conference on October 2, 1961. Leonard Koppett of The New York Times suggested that Stengel took the job to give something back to the game that had been his life for half a century.|$|E
