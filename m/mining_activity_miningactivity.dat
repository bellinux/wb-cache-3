30|$|Coal <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> {{have been}} active at the study area since half a century ago. Most of the <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> were carried out by {{inclined}} mining adits. In addition, there were numerous illegal coal <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> operated by local residents. These small-scaled illegal <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> were generally scattered randomly within the study area with an average mining depth of about 200  m. The <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> undertook very minimum safety measures, whereby most of the goaves were only either supported by a temporary shoring system or even left unsupported.|$|R
40|$|Objectives To {{identify}} {{risk factors}} for small-for-gestational age (SGA) for counties in central Appalachian states (Kentucky (KY), Tennessee (TN), Virginia (VA), and West Virginia (WV)) with varied coal <b>mining</b> <b>activities.</b> Material and Methods Live birth certificate files (1990 – 2002) were used for obtaining SGA prevalence rates for mothers based on the coal <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> of their counties of residence, mountain-top <b>mining</b> (MTM) <b>activities,</b> underground <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> but no mountain-top <b>mining</b> <b>activity</b> (non-MTM), or having no <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> (non-mining). Co-variable information, including maternal tobacco use, was also obtained from the live birth certificate. Adjusted odds ratios were obtained using multivariable logistic regression comparing SGA prevalence rates for counties with coal <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> to those without coal <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> and comparing SGA prevalence rates for counties with coal <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> for those with and without mountain-top <b>mining</b> <b>activities.</b> Comparisons were also made among those who had reported tobacco use {{and those who had}} not. Results Both tobacco use prevalence and SGA prevalence were significantly greater for mining counties than for non-mining counties and for MTM counties than for non-MTM counties. Adjustment for tobacco use alone explained 50 % of the increased SGA risk for mining counties and 75 % of the risk for MTM counties, including demographic pre-natal care co-variables that explained 75 % of the increased SGA risk for mining counties and 100 % of the risk for MTM. The increased risk of SGA was limited to the third trimester births among tobacco users and independent of the <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> of their counties of residence. Conclusions This study demonstrates that the increased prevalence of SGA among residents of counties with <b>mining</b> <b>activity</b> was primarily explained by the differences in maternal tobacco use prevalence, an effect that itself was gestational-age dependent. Self-reported tobacco use marked the population at the increased risk for SGA in central Appalachian states. Int J Occup Med Environ Health 2018; 31 (1) : 11 – 2...|$|R

40|$|Perak is a one of {{the state}} which rich in mineral {{resources}} that could be explore to provide economic contribution to the Perak State Government especially through <b>mining</b> <b>activities.</b> In the past, mining is among the main activities to generate economy to the state. Mining is found in natural form or resulting from exploration activities, creating a man-made mine. The effects of uncontrolled <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> will cause problems such as flooding and pollution in the absence of close monitoring of the Local Authority. In helping local authorities to regulate <b>mining</b> <b>activities,</b> this research will focus on the needs of the implementation of Planning Permission as provided in Section 2 (1), Town and Country Planning Act 1976 (Act 172). With the advent of mining planning permission, {{it will be able to}} ensure that any particular development of <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> will be controlled by the authorities such as the Local Authority (LA). This is because, the aspects that will be addressed in this mining planning permission process will cover three stages in planning process which is before, during and after <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> carried out. Therefore, this study was undertaken to examine the current planning criteria used by the Department of Mineral and Geosciences and State Land Office in considering and approving applications for <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> in the state, identify the factors why planning permission procedures for <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> as described in Section 2 (1) Act 172 was not fully enforced in the state and examine the implications of planning permission for Mining. To achieve these three objectives, data collection methods for this study was obtained from the primary data and secondary data and also from the distribution of questionnaires and interviews with special technical agencies relating to planning policy makers at the state level. Based on the study results, recommendations are made for improvement of processes and procedures during the procedure to ensure that elements of planning permission for <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> to comply with aspects of planning control has been set as the provisions of Act 172 to ensure sustainable <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> can be implemente...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} discusses about mangrove density mapping {{and monitoring}} on tin mining area. The tin mining area refers to unconventional mining, {{which is a}} tin <b>mining</b> <b>activity</b> using simple mechanical instrument. Tin <b>mining</b> <b>activity</b> has been long existed in Bangka Belitung, conducted legally and illegally. Tin <b>mining</b> <b>activity</b> makes coastal supporting ecosystems such as mangrove cannot play their role normally. One of the regency in Bangka Belitung, which its coastal area is affected by un-conventional mining, is South Bangka. The {{aim of this study}} is to monitor and measure the mangrove density changes. This research use Landsat data acquisition from year 1997, 2009 and 2014 through NDVI analysis. The result shows that tin <b>mining</b> <b>activity</b> in South Bangka coastal area causes reduction in mangrove density. The field studies indicated that 4 types of mangrove was found. The types of mangrove are Avicennia marina, Sonneratia caseolaris, Rhizopora mucronata, and Xylocarpus granatum. Mangrove management is needed in order to maintain the quality of coastal ecosystem. Moreover, the regulation and monitoring of the <b>mining</b> <b>activity</b> should be issued by the government to support environmental sustainability...|$|R
