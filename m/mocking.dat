5|$|The central figure's {{mouth is}} {{positioned}} directly on its neck, {{rather than on}} a distinct face. It bares its teeth {{as if in a}} snarl, and is blindfolded by a drooping cloth bandage—a device likely drawn from Matthias Grünewald's <b>Mocking</b> of Christ. This creature faces the viewer directly and is centralised by a series of converging lines radiating {{from the base of the}} pedestal.|$|E
5|$|After {{some time}} away from TV, Ziggler {{returned}} on the August 22 edition of SmackDown Live to declare that he would undergo a gimmick change on the following week's edition. He later started <b>mocking,</b> week after week, the entrances of current and former wrestlers such as John Cena, Naomi, Shawn Michaels and Randy Savage. Ziggler believed that fans only cared about elaborated entrances, and not about the in-ring performances, where he claimed he was the best. However, after <b>mocking</b> The Undertaker's entrance, Ziggler was interrupted by Bobby Roode, who challenged Ziggler to a match at Hell in a Cell, which Ziggler accepted. At the event Ziggler, who had promised a never seen before entrance but ended up being an entrance with no music, lights and titantron, was defeated by Roode after a Roll Up; right after that, Ziggler attacked Roode from behind with a Zig Zag. On the October 17 edition of SmackDown Live, Ziggler defeated Roode in a rematch by a roll up, similar to how Roode defeated him. On 31st October's edition of Smackdown, Ziggler failed to earn a spot in Team Smackdown for Survivor Series 5 on 5 elimination match vs Raw after being defeated by Roode in a 2 out of 3 falls match and thus ending their feud.|$|E

5|$|Another {{difference}} in Troilus' characterisation from the Filostrato {{is that he}} is no longer misogynistic in the beginning. Instead of <b>mocking</b> lovers because of their putting trust in women, he mocks them because of how love affects them. Troilus' vision of love is stark: total commitment offers total fulfilment; any form of failure means total rejection. He is unable to comprehend the subtleties and complexities that underlie Criseyde's vacillations and Pandarus' manoeuvrings.|$|E
5|$|Between 1772 and 1779, Espejo {{provoked}} the colonial authorities, who regarded him as responsible for several satirical and <b>mocking</b> posters. These posters {{were attached to}} the doors of churches and other buildings, and their anonymous author tended to attack the colonial authorities, the clergy or any other subject he deemed convenient. Although no surviving posters have been found, evidence from comments Espejo made in his writings suggests that he wrote them.|$|E
5|$|Even after Suys' {{proposal}} was officially adopted, Anspach faced strong {{opposition to the}} project. This opposition came first from engineers who felt that the covering was incompatible with Brussels’s geology, would accumulate potentially dangerous gases {{and would not be}} able to handle enough water to prevent floods. Others opposed to the project complained about the high taxes resulting from its high cost, poor compensation for seized property and the lack of public input into the project. The press accused Anspach of being responsible for demolishing Brussels' old town, and published numerous caricatures <b>mocking</b> him.|$|E

5|$|More sportingly, the 5th century BC tragedian Euripides often {{played with}} the old traditions, <b>mocking</b> them, and through the voice of his {{characters}} injecting notes of doubt. Yet the subjects of his plays were taken, without exception, from myth. Many of these plays were written in answer to a predecessor's {{version of the same}} or similar myth. Euripides mainly impugns the myths about the gods and begins his critique with an objection similar to the one previously expressed by Xenocrates: the gods, as traditionally represented, are far too crassly anthropomorphic.|$|E
5|$|When the {{inhabitants}} of Alexandria heard of Caracalla's claims that he had killed his brother Geta in self-defence, they produced a satire <b>mocking</b> this as well as Caracalla's other pretensions. In 215 Caracalla travelled to Alexandria and responded to this insult by slaughtering the deputation of leading citizens who had unsuspectingly assembled before the city to greet his arrival, before setting his troops against Alexandria for several days of looting and plunder. Following the massacre at Alexandria, Caracalla moved east onto Armenia. By 216 he had pushed through Armenia and south into Parthia.|$|E

After SG-1 go missing on their off-world mission, a Goa'uld named Ba'al {{contacts}} Stargate Command and suggests an exchange of the captured SG-1 against Camulus, another Goa'uld who requested asylum on Earth several episodes before. With the help of Camulus, a potent power source is found and brought back to Stargate Command, only to find it tainted by Camulus (powering it up could result in the destruction of the Solar system). With the SGC suffering from a temporary electricity failure caused by the alien plants, Ba'al's renewed contacting only results in O'Neill's <b>mocking.</b> Exhausted by sleep deprivation two days to Zero Hour, O'Neill finishes his letter to General Hammond to inform him of his resignation.|$|E

5|$|During {{the initial}} months on board, Vala Mal Doran (Claudia Black) {{repeatedly}} tries to seduce Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks). Daniel finally confronts Vala {{for what he}} believes to be her insincerity, teasing, and <b>mocking</b> of him. Vala's upset reaction makes Daniel realize the honesty of her feelings, and they share a passionate embrace. As the years pass, each team member attempts {{to deal with the}} isolation. General Landry develops a gardening hobby; Carter learns how to play the cello; Daniel continues the translation of Asgard information in the database and develops his relationship with Vala; and Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder) and Teal'c (Christopher Judge) exercise and train while Mitchell is growing more frustrated and angry. After many years, General Landry succumbs to old age and dies.|$|E
5|$|Fielding's seventh play, Rape upon Rape; or, The Justice Caught in His Own Trap, was a five-act comedic {{play that}} first ran on 23 June 1730 at the Little Theatre for eight nights. The play enjoyed some success {{until it was}} renamed The Coffee-House Politician and was altered to {{possibly}} update the play as it focused on <b>mocking</b> current news events. The play is a love comedy that incorporates a corrupt judge that stands in the lovers' way. Eventually, various characters attempt to stop the judge, but he prevails albeit in a comedic fashion. Fielding's focus in the play is to point out corruption in government and to attack those who abuse their power.|$|E
5|$|Ged is {{depicted}} as proud and yet unsure of himself in multiple situations: early in his apprenticeship he believes Ogion to be <b>mocking</b> him, and later, at Roke, feels put upon by Jasper. In both cases, he believes that others do not appreciate his greatness, and Le Guin's sympathetic narration does not immediately contradict this belief. Cadden writes that Le Guin allows young readers to sympathize with Ged, and only gradually {{realize that there is}} a price to be paid for his actions, as he learns to discipline his magical powers. Similarly, as Ged begins his apprenticeship with Ogion, he imagines that he will be taught mysterious aspects of wizardry, and has visions of transforming himself into other creatures, but gradually comes to see that Ogion's important lessons are those about his own self.|$|E
30|$|The key {{theory in}} the proof of the {{asymptotic}} for u^*(n) relies on an identity expressing U^*(q) as a mixed <b>mock</b> modular form. The function f(q) is called a mixed <b>mock</b> modular form {{if it is the}} product of a modular form and a <b>mock</b> theta function. Indeed, both U^*(q) and the related mixed <b>mock</b> modular form are associated with the Ramanujan <b>mock</b> theta functions. By using the pseudo-modularity of mixed <b>mock</b> modular forms, and a version of the circle method developed by Bringmann and Mahlburg [3], the asymptotic formulas for u^*(n) are proved by Rhoades.|$|R

5|$|In June, Edge won the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship (the unified {{version of}} the World Tag Team Championship from the Raw brand and the WWE Tag Team Championship from the SmackDown brand) with Chris Jericho at The Bash after he and Jericho were {{inserted}} into what was originally a match between reigning champions The Colóns and Legacy. The win made Edge a record setting 12 time World Tag Team Champion. On July 3, Edge suffered a torn Achilles tendon while competing at a live event in San Diego in a match against Jeff Hardy, and later underwent surgery. It was reported {{that he could be}} out of action for up to a year.

5|$|In September, Randy Orton, who at {{the time}} was injured, made an {{appearance}} on Raw, where he criticized all the champions, <b>mocking</b> Rhodes and DiBiase for allowing their title belts to be stolen by Cryme Tyme (Shad Gaspard and JTG). The two responded by assaulting Cryme Tyme and introducing Manu (son of Afa the Wild Samoan) as their new member at Unforgiven. This did little to impress Orton, so later that evening Rhodes, DiBiase, and Manu assaulted World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk as Orton confronted him backstage. This allowed Orton to punt Punk in the head, removing him from his championship match, and gaining Orton's respect.|$|E
5|$|Jocelin {{was one of}} {{the main}} advisors of King John during the dispute with the pope over Stephen Langton's {{appointment}} to the Archbishopric of Canterbury. Jocelin did not immediately leave England after Pope Innocent III placed an interdict on England. Jocelin encouraged John to settle with Innocent in early 1209, worried that Innocent would expand the interdict into an excommunication, forcing John's advisors to choose between serving the king or obeying the pope. Nothing came of the negotiations, however. Jocelin did leave England when John was excommunicated in late 1209. Jocelin, along with Gilbert Glanvill, the Bishop of Rochester, was the subject of a <b>mocking</b> song on his conduct during the interdict.|$|E
