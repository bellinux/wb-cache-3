25|$|Deregulation gained {{momentum}} in the mid-1970s, spurred by slow productivity growth and increasing operation and capital costs in several key sectors. It was not until 1978 that the first meaningful deregulation legislation, the Airline Deregulation Act, was cleared by Congress. Transportation deregulation accelerated in 1980, with the deregulation of railroads and trucking. Deregulation of interstate buses followed in 1982. In addition to transportation deregulation, savings and loan associations and banks were partially deregulated with the Depository Institutions Deregulation and <b>Monetary</b> <b>Control</b> Act in 1980 and the Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act in 1982.|$|E

2500|$|In 1980, the United States Congress granted all thrifts, {{including}} {{savings and}} loan associations, {{the power to make}} consumer and commercial loans and to issue transaction accounts. Designed to help the thrift industry retain its deposit base and to improve its profitability, the Depository Institutions Deregulation and <b>Monetary</b> <b>Control</b> Act (DIDMCA) of 1980 allowed thrifts to make consumer loans up to 20 percent of their assets, issue credit cards, accept negotiable order of withdrawal [...] accounts from individuals and nonprofit organizations, and invest up to 20 percent of their assets in commercial real estate loans.|$|E
2500|$|Commentators argued {{traditional}} banking regulation {{contained the}} [...] "seeds {{of its own}} destruction" [...] by [...] "distorting competition" [...] and [...] "creating gaps between cost and price." [...] In particular, by establishing [...] "cartel profits" [...] traditional bank regulation led nonbank competitors to develop products that could compete with bank deposits and loans to gain part of such profits. Instead of financial stability inducing deregulation and financial instability after 1980, as later suggested by David Moss and Elizabeth Warren, Thomas Huertas and other critics of traditional bank regulation argued Regulation Q limits on interest rates (mandated by the 1933 Banking Act) created the [...] "disintermediation" [...] {{that began in the}} 1960s, led to the phase-out of Regulation Q through the Depository Institutions Deregulation and <b>Monetary</b> <b>Control</b> Act of 1980, and opened banking to greater competition.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{there are}} {{separate}} rules applied to most banks. The U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously in the 1978 Marquette Nat. Bank of Minneapolis v. First of Omaha Service Corp. {{case that the}} National Banking Act of 1863 allowed nationally chartered banks to charge the legal rate of interest in their state regardless of the borrower's state of residence. In 1980, Congress passed the Depository Institutions Deregulation and <b>Monetary</b> <b>Control</b> Act. [...] Among the Act's provisions, it exempted federally chartered savings banks, installment plan sellers and chartered loan companies from state usury limits. Combined with the Marquette decision that applied to National Banks, this effectively overrode all state and local usury laws. The 1968 Truth in Lending Act does not regulate rates, except for some mortgages, but requires uniform or standardized disclosure of costs and charges.|$|E
2500|$|The {{deregulation}} of S in 1980, by the Depository Institutions Deregulation and <b>Monetary</b> <b>Control</b> Act signed by President Jimmy Carter on March 31, 1980, gave them {{many of the}} capabilities of banks without the same regulations as banks, without explicit FDIC oversight. Savings and loan associations could choose to be under either a state or a federal charter. This decision was made {{in response to the}} dramatically increasing interest rates and inflation rates that the S market experienced due to vulnerabilities {{in the structure of the}} market. [...] Immediately after {{deregulation of}} the federally chartered thrifts, state-chartered thrifts rushed to become federally chartered, because of the advantages associated with a federal charter. In response, states such as California and Texas changed their regulations to be similar to federal regulations.|$|E
2500|$|With that in mind, Congress finally {{acted on}} deregulating the thrift industry. It passed two laws, the Depository Institutions Deregulation and <b>Monetary</b> <b>Control</b> Act of 1980 and the Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982. The {{deregulation}} not only allowed thrifts {{to offer a}} wider array of savings products (including adjustable rate mortgages, which fixed one important problem), but also significantly expanded their lending authority and reduced regulatory oversight. These changes were intended to allow S to [...] "grow" [...] out of their problems, and as such represented {{the first time that}} the government explicitly sought to influence S profits as opposed to promoting housing and homeownership. Other changes in thrift oversight included authorizing the use of more lenient accounting rules to report their financial condition, and the elimination of restrictions on the minimum numbers of S stockholders. Such policies, combined with an overall decline in regulatory oversight (known as forbearance), would later be cited as factors in the collapse of the thrift industry.|$|E
50|$|By October 1994, inflation, {{which had}} been reduced by tighter fiscal and {{monetary}} policies early in 1994, began to soar once again to dangerous levels.

40|$|Structuralist {{models of}} {{development}} still {{persist in the}} 1990 s, and many developing countries continue to target macroeconomic stability through aggressive <b>monetary</b> <b>controls</b> based on structuralist assumptions. Simultaneously, prudential criteria, principally capital controls take effect through the commercial banking system. It is the central hypothesis of this thesis that <b>monetary</b> <b>controls</b> impact adversely on commercial bank performance and on banks' market share, and that the simultaneous implementation of monetary and prudential regulation can undermine the objectives of monetary stability {{and the growth of}} the banking system. This study argues that those monetary measures most frequently applied to protect the balance of payments; primary and secondary reserve requirements, credit controls, and interest rate controls, force cost adjustments and non-optimal portfolio realignments which stymie commercial bank performance. These arguments are illustrated from the cases of Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago for the period 1973 - 1992. The study discusses the rationale for regulation, analyses commercial bank performance in the Caribbean and formulates a model which includes regulatory variables for testing the impact of monetary and prudential regulation on bank performance. The model also defines the determinants of bank performance and provides the basis for deriving regulation and performance indices with global application. Results disclose that most regulatory variables are negatively associated with commercial bank performance and tentative causality is established running from regulation to bank performance. Where cost-axiomatic interest rate-setting is practised the adverse impact on bank performance is alleviated, but unevenness of monetary and prudential regulations adversely influence the performance of commercial banks, contributing to loss of market share relative to non-banks. Regulation assists in achieving macroeconomic objectives, but greater liberalisation appears desirable for the development of commercial banking. However, new monetary theories are needed to identify alternative vehicles, other than commercial banks, if macroeconomic objectives are to be achieved in increasingly liberalised environments...|$|R

40|$|The overall {{conclusion}} of recent macroeconomic literature {{is that the}} existence of an independent central bank, which is responsible for monetary stability and increases <b>monetary</b> <b>controls,</b> in the long-term favours a non-inflationary trend in monetary aggregates, without creating negative repercussions on fiscal and real aggregates.
