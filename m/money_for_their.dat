5|$|In an {{interview}} with ABC News, Esch and Lefkow stated that {{they came up with}} the original idea for bacon products and their first invention, Bacon Salt, while making a joke about the subject over a meal at a diner. The <b>money</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> startup came from the $5000 that Lefkow had obtained while on America's Funniest Home Videos. The idea to make bacon spreadable came from a customer's request. Together, they created interest in their products by going to numerous sporting events dressed in bacon costumes and used social networking sites to raise awareness of their company.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010, {{there are}} 47 active {{members of the}} {{organization}} and the president is Suzette Venturini. The group meets on the third Tuesday of February, April, May, August, September, October and November in the Marble Hall of Mt. St. Peter Church. The meetings consist of discussing projects and praying together. The St. Anthony Guild is known for their visits to the home-bound of the parish at Christmas and Easter and also for their Tree of Angels Campaign. This campaign allows parishioners to purchase angels in memory of loved ones that are placed on the church's Christmas tree. The money raised from these angel ornaments is donated to children in need. The guild also has many entertaining fundraisers to raise <b>money</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> charity projects. Some of these include a dance for parishioners in the fall, bingo nights, and selling coupons for special shopping days at Macy's.|$|E
5|$|Following the Black Death, the {{invasion}} of Gotland by Valdemar IV of Denmark and the Battle of Visby in 1361, and a general decrease in trade, Gotland entered a period of decline. From about 1361, building activity therefore dropped. The inauguration of Sankta Karin in 1412 {{marks the end of}} church building activity in Visby. When troops from Lübeck pillaged the city in 1525, and probably damaged several of the churches, the social and economic rationale for sustaining them had vanished. With the advent of the Reformation soon afterwards, the religious rationale to sustain the upkeep of the many churches also permanently disappeared. All monasteries were abolished and all churches within the city walls except one (present-day Visby Cathedral) were abandoned and left to decay. During the following centuries, some church ruins were used as quarries. In 1805 the church ruins were protected by law and in 1863 the Swedish state for the first time allocated <b>money</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> conservation.|$|E

5|$|In New York City, the Ojibwe {{attracted}} attention, gaining {{publicity and}} <b>money</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> cause. In Washington, however, they {{were turned away}} by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and told they should never have come in the first place. Luckily, they drew {{the attention of the}} Whig Congressman Briggs from New York, who was scheduled a meeting with President Millard Fillmore the next day. He invited the Ojibwa to come with him to see the president. At the meeting, Buffalo rose first. He performed the pipe ceremony with a pipe made especially for the occasion. He had the younger chief Oshaga speak {{for more than an hour}} about the broken treaty promises and the disastrous attempt at removal. Fillmore agreed to consider the issues. The next day, he announced that the removal order would be canceled, the payment of annuities would be returned to La Pointe, and another treaty would set up permanent reservations for the Ojibwe in Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|One of Fox's {{earliest}} supporters was Isadore Sharp, {{founder of}} the Four Seasons Hotels. Sharp had lost his own son to cancer and offered Fox and his companions free accommodation at his hotels. He donated $10,000 and challenged 999 other businesses to do the same. Sharp also proposed an annual fundraising run in Fox's name. Fox agreed, but insisted that the runs be non-competitive. There were to be no winners or losers, and anyone who participated could run, walk or ride. Sharp faced opposition to the project. The Cancer Society feared that a fall run would detract from its traditional April campaigns, while other charities believed that an additional fundraiser would leave less <b>money</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> causes. Sharp persisted, and he, the Four Seasons Hotels and the Fox family organized the first Terry Fox Run on September 13, 1981.|$|E
5|$|Run privately for profit, as {{were all}} English prisons until the 19th century, the Marshalsea {{looked like an}} Oxbridge college and functioned as an {{extortion}} racket. Debtors in the 18th century who could afford the prison fees had access to a bar, shop and restaurant, and retained the crucial privilege of being allowed out during the day, which gave {{them a chance to}} earn <b>money</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> creditors. Everyone else was crammed into one of nine small rooms with dozens of others, possibly for years for the most modest of debts, which increased as unpaid prison fees accumulated. The poorest faced starvation and, if they crossed the jailers, torture with skullcaps and thumbscrews. A parliamentary committee reported in 1729 that 300inmates had starved to death within a three-month period, and that eight to ten were dying every 24hours in the warmer weather.|$|E

5|$|Sir George {{created a}} deer park that ranged far north of Radyr. Tenant farmers there were evicted, {{and the loss}} of rental income contributed to the decline in the family's fortunes. He had 24 children, eight of whom were illegitimate. Many were daughters, and Sir George needed large sums of <b>money</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> dowries. On his death Sir George's lands passed to his eldest son William, who also became a MP and {{invested}} in the Pentyrch ironworks. This was an astute move as feudalism was giving way to early industrialisation. William's descendants inherited a diminishing fortune. Captain George Mathew, the last of the family to live in Radyr, married Elizabeth Poyntz, and the couple left Radyr to live on her estates at Thurles in County Tipperary, Ireland in 1625.|$|E
5|$|The abdication of Napoleon {{in early}} April 1814 brought the War of the Sixth Coalition to a close. Corfu, the longest-held French {{territory}} in the Adriatic surrendered and {{was added to the}} United States of the Ionian Islands under British protection. Many awards were presented in Britain for service in the Adriatic, Hoste, Maxwell and Fremantle among those knighted in the 1815 reforms to the knightly orders, as well as the recipients of a large amount of prize <b>money</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> captures in the theatre. The dearth of significant fleet actions in the last nine years of the war also increased public interest in actions such as that at Lissa, which were widely celebrated {{both before and after the}} peace.|$|E

She conceived the book {{as a way to}} help raise <b>money</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> work, and a portion of the proceeds from I Love Bacon will be donated to the two charities. Rockmill began by asking chefs she knew personally to donate bacon recipes, and then contacted others across the United States.

40|$|Summary. — Money is a {{reference}} and a commodity created and chosen by a community. In Europe, one {{all too often}} forgets that the European model {{is not the only}} one in existence in the rest of the world. An acquaintance with African monetary practices shows us that, for necessities of trade, foreigners imposed their own currencies and tried to used local <b>moneys</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> own advantage. Much further work is needed to increase our understanding of these very old and complex African moneys. Rivallain Josette. Monnaies d'Afrique : visions africaines et visions européennes.

5|$|Each round {{began with}} a toss-up {{physical}} challenge in which both teams competed, with the winning team receiving both initial control of the round, and <b>money</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> score. After the toss-up, the host began asking trivia questions of the team in control. Each correct answer earned a monetary award, and allowed the team to maintain control, while an incorrect answer, or failure to respond within approximately ten seconds turned control over to the opponents. However, the team could dare their opponents to answer the question, doubling its value; in response, the opponents could double dare for quadruple the original value. When the team in control was challenged to a double dare, they had to either answer or compete in a physical challenge. An incorrect answer, or not responding within approximately five seconds on a dare or double dare, awarded both control and the appropriate {{amount of money to}} the team that issued it. The second round played the same as the first, with question values doubled. On Double Dare and Super Sloppy Double Dare, a question was initially worth $10. On Family Double Dare and Double Dare 2000, a question was initially worth $25.|$|E
5|$|Neville was {{appointed}} as Chief Forester under King Richard I in 1198. As the official {{in charge of}} the royal forests, he held one of the four great offices of the state: the others were the justiciar, the chancellor, and the treasurer. The forester was responsible for enforcing the forest law– the special law that applied to the royal forests– and presided over the forest justices, who held forest eyres. There was also a special forest exchequer, or forest treasury. In 1198 Neville presided over an Assize of the Forest that was described by the chronicler Roger of Howden as greatly oppressive. The revenues could be considerable; in 1198 the forest eyre brought in £1,980. Neville stated in 1208 that over the previous {{six and a half years}} the amount raised by the various revenues of the forests had been £15,000; in 1212 it had been £4,486. Forest law was resented by the king's subjects, not just for its severity but also because of the large extent of the kingdom that it encompassed. It covered not just woodlands, but by the end of the 12th century between a quarter and a third of the whole kingdom. This extent enabled the Norman and Angevin kings to use the harsh punishments of forest law to extract large sums of <b>money</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> government.|$|E
