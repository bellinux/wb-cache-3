As a result, applications to the east corridor countries once received by postal communication can be responded in normal cases, by Austria and Germany, with a preliminary approval within days and a definite approval within weeks. If additional written records are required (as may be the case in the western corridor countries), the weeks will become <b>months.</b> If <b>insurance</b> <b>periods</b> were acquired in the sending countries before or after returning home, then their collection and verification can be time-consuming, particularly if the date of birth or name is unclear. If benefit information from the sending country is required to establish totalization or the level of top-ups when residing in the host country, the delay can be substantial as is the loss of benefit disbursement or delayed payment of top-ups.|$|R

Frequent delays occur during {{the confirmation of}} the extent of <b>insurance</b> <b>periods</b> in Morocco and Turkey, as local institutions must generate individual insurance data from documents provided in paper form by regional offices. The list of <b>insurance</b> <b>periods</b> is collected only at the time of a pension application, and account clearances with yearly entitlement announcements do not exist. Thus, for example, the pension application for the Austrian or German part is processed very quickly as the domestic insurance file is essentially ready at the time of application, but in Turkey, the process may take many months (for details see Holzmann et al. 2016 a, 2016 b).

Using the case of an emerging economy, Bolivia, which introduced a deposit insurance system during the sample period, we compare the risk-taking behavior of banks before and after the introduction of this system. We find that in the post-deposit <b>insurance</b> <b>period,</b> banks are more likely to initiate riskier loans (i. e., loans with worse internal ratings at origination). These loans carry higher interest rates and are associated with worse ex-post performance (i. e., they have higher default and delinquency rates). Banks do not seem to compensate for the extra risk by increasing collateral requirements or decreasing loan maturities. We also find evidence that the increase in risk-taking is due to the decrease in market discipline from large depositors. Finally, differences between large (too-big-to-fail) and small banks diminished in the post-deposit <b>insurance</b> <b>period.</b> ...|$|R

This article focuses on a detailed analysis of non-contributory periods in the Czech pension system and their impact on pension system balance and micro and macro economic connections. The extent of non-contributory periods considered in the pension system represents one of the theoretical possibilities of parametric changes to the pension insurance system. The amount of non-contributory periods or the proportion between non-contributory periods and years worked, or the proportion between paid <b>insurance</b> and non-contributory <b>periods</b> (potential loss of insurance contributions) has, to date, merely been estimated in the Czech Republic. The study presents the first accurate figures, based on unique individual data on insured persons.

However, since 2013, Caisse Nationale de Securite Sociale (CNSS) has developed electronic forms, for instance, for birth and death certificates.

The proposed flexible design is a generic framework that uses Growing Degree Days to determine annual variable start and end dates for the insured period. This approach reflects the progress of phenological plant growth phases more accurately than fixed periods and hence is expected to reduce the basis risk of the index insurance. In addition, we develop an economic framework that focuses on the role of downside risks and apply Quantile Regression to tailor optimal insurance specifications. This framework is then used to compare the downside risks {{associated with the use of}} flexible and fixed <b>insurance</b> <b>periods.</b> The results show that the introduction of flexibility in the index design leads to a reduction in farmers’ downside risk exposure and to a more efficient contract design...|$|R
