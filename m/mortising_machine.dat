2500|$|Manufacturing became well {{established}} during the mid 19th century. Labor in the U.S. was expensive and industry {{made every effort}} to economize by using machinery. Woodworking machinery such as circular saws, high speed lathes, planers and <b>mortising</b> <b>machines</b> and various other machines amazed the British as was reported by Joseph Whitworth.

50|$|Marc Isambard Brunel had {{independently}} conceived {{designs for}} <b>mortising</b> and boring <b>machines,</b> which he showed to Bentham, who recognized {{the superiority of}} Brunel's designs. Henry Maudslay, the mechanic who built the machines, became a prominent machine tool builder. The Portsmouth Block Mills marked the arrival of mass production techniques in British manufacturing.|$|R

5000|$|He was [...] "one of {{the most}} {{skillful}} and ingenious of mechanics" [...] and invented the first boring and <b>mortising</b> <b>machine</b> ever used {{in the manufacture of}} wagon wheels. Additionally, he invented a number of smaller labor saving devices and was the first to invent adjustable hollow augers and saw vises.|$|E

50|$|According to one source, New Britain Machine {{was founded}} in New Britain, Connecticut in 1887. However, {{according}} to Archives & Special Collections at the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center, it {{was founded in}} 1895 subsequent to the J.T. Case Engine Company, a manufacturer of steam engines. The first product the new company produced was a chainsaw <b>mortising</b> <b>machine.</b> In 1917, it registered the None Better trademark to sell its line of sockets and tools. Much of New Britain Machine's early tool production was done under the None Better line. Many of the early tools were carbon steel, offering a lower cost alternative to the higher price alloy steels of the day. Early tool sets consisted of hex drive sockets and an ell bar for the drive tool. Beginning in the 1930s, the None Better line consisted {{of a wide variety of}} 1/2 square drive tools with a Cadmium finish. At this time, New Britain Machine was also supplying tools for Sears in their Craftsman line of tools. These tools are easy to distinguish as they either have a BE or an H in a circle stamped into the tools. The New Britain Machine line was also created at this time as a higher priced alloy steel alternative.|$|E
5000|$|While {{their younger}} brother Preston painted portraits, Edward M. and Jesse {{worked in the}} family business, {{manufacturing}} wagons, buggies, carriages, as well as mantels, window sashes, and other furniture items. This family business venture is significant because it represents {{the coming of the}} industrial age to this small South Carolina town. The Laurensville Herald of December 20, 1850 reports that Edward Hix (the elder) had [...] "purchased the lot behind Mr. S. R. Todd's store from Saxon and Farley and is erecting a steam saw and gristmill." [...] By January 17, 1851, the paper reported that Hix, who had been elected a [...] "Warden of Laurensville," [...] had [...] "purchased the necessary material and machinery and is erecting buildings to put up a steam factory on the lot below Mr. Todd's store consisting of a sawmill, gristmill, planing and <b>mortising</b> <b>machine</b> {{and a variety of other}} smaller machines." [...] Interestingly, the Herald goes on to editorialize a bit, stating, [...] "It will not be long before the dark smoke of the steam horse will be peering aloft over our hitherto quiet little village." [...] These two brothers purchased the business and other property from their father on May 24, 1869.|$|E
