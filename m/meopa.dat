40|$|International audienceRenal denervation {{using the}} {{technique}} of radiofrequency is used only recently {{for the treatment of}} resistant hypertension. Normally, it is done under general anesthesia because the ablation point technique is painful. We suggest an alternative to general anesthesia comprising an association of morphin 0. 1 mg/kg IV to <b>MEOPA</b> (gas combining oxygen and azot protoxyd) delivered through an oxygen mask. Our series includes 12 consecutive patients treated between October 2011 and June 2013, the first five patients (group 1) have received only an hydroxizin and morphin sedation. Every five have felt the ablation painful, in two cases bearable pain (EVA 5) pain leading to increasing doses of morphin, (total dose of 0. 25 mg/kg in two cases, 0. 17 mg in one case). For the seven following patients, a protocol including hydroxyzin, morphin and <b>MEOPA</b> given through a mask has been set up. Only one patient has felt a mild pain (EVA 5) leading to an increasing dose of morphin (total dose 0. 17 mg/kg). None of the six other patients has felt any pain during the procedure. The average dose of morphin is 0. 17 mg/kg in group 1, 0. 11 mg/kg in group 2. This is a preliminary study; if confirmed, it will allow a lot of hospitals without on-site possibilities of general anesthesia, to realize such procedures. regarding pain, the procedure of renal ablation was well tolerated for six among seven patients receiving the association <b>MEOPA</b> and IV morphin. In contrast, in the five patients treated only with IV morphin, we observed a less good tolerance to pain and the need to increase the doses of IV morphin...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAimsTo {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of an analgesic protocol with nitrous oxide and anaesthetic cream (lidocaine and prilocaine, EMLA) for children undergoing botulinum toxin injections. Patients and methodsProspective study including 51  injection sessions, 34  children {{with a mean age of}} 5. 94 (range 2 – 15) and 209  injected muscles. Pain was evaluated with the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS), the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Face Pain Scale (FPS) for the children and with a VAS for the parents. ResultsCHEOPS score for the 51  sessions was 8. 50 (S. D.   3. 56). Forty-nine percent of scores were above the therapeutic threshold of 9; 25 % of the children evaluated the pain above the therapeutic threshold of 3; 44. 74 % of the parents’ estimations exceeded 3. No correlation was found between age, weight, number of injected muscle and CHEOPS score. ConclusionThe association of <b>MEOPA</b> and anaesthetic cream is only effective for 50 % of children. This is much lower than treatments for other types of acute induced pain in children. Botulinum toxin injections and cerebral palsy children present certain specificities which require improvements in this analgesic protocol...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeIn {{order to}} assess the {{establishment}} of a pediatric PICC line service in a University Hospital after the first 91 consecutive procedures. Materials/Patients and methodsRetrospective study over a period of 24 months. The criteria analysed were success or failure of the procedure, indication, age when inserted, type of PICC line, mean length of use and development of complications such as accidental removal, venous thrombosis or infection. ResultsNinety-one PICC lines were inserted in 74 patients between 4 months and 25 years old (sex-ratio: 1. 1  girls/boys). The procedure was performed under general anaesthesia in four cases (4. 4 %) and under EMLA and <b>MEOPA</b> in 87 cases (95. 6 %). The insertion was ultrasound guided through the basilic (n= 63, 70 %), humeral (n= 18, 20 %) or cephalic (n= 9, 10 %) veins in the non-dominant arm (L in 62 cases, R in 28 cases). The insertion success rate was 99 % (n= 90). The main indications were starting antibiotic therapy (n= 47, 52 %), chemotherapy (n= 34, 38 %) and parenteral nutrition (n= 5, 5 %). The devices used were single lumen 3 F (n= 4, 4 %), single lumen 4 F (n= 31, 34 %), double lumen 4 F (n= 2, 2. 2 %), single lumen 5 F (n= 12, 13 %), and double lumen 5 F (n= 41, 45 %). The PICC line was used for an average period of 45 days (14 to 300 days). The complications found were accidental removal (n= 2, 2. 2 %), catheter fracture (n= 2; 2. 2 %), obstruction (n= 5, 5. 5 %), suspected infection (n= 1, 1. 1 %), and venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (n= 3, 3. 3 %). The overall complication rate was 14. 4 % (n= 13) including 4. 4 % serious complications (n= 4). ConclusionPICC lines are a future solution in pediatrics. This technique is reliable and has a similar complication rate to studies carried out in adults, most of which can be prevented by careful catheter maintenance and informing the care staff...|$|E
