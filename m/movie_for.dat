5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the growing {{practice}} of screening nonmainstream motion pictures as late shows, {{with the goal}} of building a cult film audience, brought the midnight movie concept home to the cinema, now in a countercultural setting—something like a drive-in <b>movie</b> <b>for</b> the hip. One of the first films adopted by the new circuit in 1971 was the three-year-old Night of the Living Dead. The midnight movie success of low-budget pictures made entirely outside the studio system, like John Waters' Pink Flamingos (1972), with its campy spin on exploitation, spurred the development of the independent film movement. The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), an inexpensive film from 20th Century Fox that spoofed all manner of classic B picture clichés, became an unparalleled hit when it was relaunched as a late show feature the year after its initial, unprofitable release. Even as Rocky Horror generated its own subcultural phenomenon, it contributed to the mainstreaming of the theatrical midnight movie.|$|E

5|$|Ten {{months before}} Conran made the movie with his actors, he shot it entirely with stand-ins in Los Angeles and then created the whole movie in {{animatics}} {{so that the}} actors had {{an idea of what}} the film would look like and where to move on the soundstage. To prepare for the film, Conran had his cast watch old movies, such as Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not (1944) for Paltrow's performance and The Thin Man (1934) for the relationship between Nick and Nora that was to be echoed in the one between Joe and Polly. Avnet constantly pushed for room in this meticulously designed <b>movie</b> <b>for</b> the kind of freedom the actors needed, like being able to move around on the soundstage.|$|E
5|$|After the Nuremberg rallies trilogy and Olympia, Riefenstahl {{began work}} on the movie she had {{tried and failed to}} direct once before, namely Tiefland. On Hitler's direct order, the German {{government}} paid her seven million Reichsmarks in compensation. From 23 September until 13 November 1940, she filmed in Krün near Mittenwald. The extras playing Spanish women and farmers were drawn from gypsies detained in a camp at Salzburg-Maxglan who were forced to work with her. Filming at the Babelsberg Studios near Berlin began 18 months later in April 1942. This time Sinti and Roma people from the Marzahn detention camp near Berlin were compelled to work as extras. Almost to the end of her life, despite overwhelming evidence that the concentration camp occupants had been forced to work on the movie unpaid, Riefenstahl continued to maintain all the film extras survived and that she had met several of them after the war. Riefenstahl sued filmmaker Nina Gladitz, who said Riefenstahl personally chose the extras at their holding camp; Gladitz had found one of the Gypsy survivors and matched his memory with stills of the <b>movie</b> <b>for</b> a documentary Gladitz was filming. The German court ruled largely in favour of Gladitz, declaring that Riefenstahl had known the extras were from a concentration camp, but they also agreed that Riefenstahl had not been informed the Gypsies would be sent to Auschwitz after filming was completed.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, Nolan Bushnell {{founded a}} new computer-guided {{animation}} studio called Kadabrascope as {{a subsidiary of}} his Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatres company, {{which was founded in}} 1977. Only one major project was made out of the new studio, an animated Christmas <b>movie</b> <b>for</b> NBC starring Chuck E. Cheese and other PTT mascots. The animation movement would be made using Tweening instead of traditional cel animation. After the North American Video Game Crash of 1983, Bushnell started selling some subsidiaries of PTT to keep the business afloat. Sente Technologies (another division, was founded to have games distributed in PTT stores) would be sold to Bally Games and Kadabrascope would be sold to LucasFilm. The Kadabrascope assets would be combined with the Computer Division of LucasFilm. Coincidentally, Steve Jobs, a main Apple shareholder and former CEO, worked under Bushnell in 1973 as a technician at his other company Atari, which Bushnell sold to Warner Communications in 1976 to focus on PTT. PTT would later go bankrupt in 1985 and be acquired by ShowBiz Pizza Place.|$|E

5|$|The opening {{movie to}} Ever 17 {{was created by}} the game's producer, who picked out CGs and {{keywords}} from the game to include. Nakazawa gave instructions to have the characters appear in the same order as the recommended route playing order the developers had decided on, hoping for the order to leave an impression and influence players to play the game in that order. The ending movie was created by Nakazawa, who was not used to the tools used in video creation. He added a timeline to the credits roll, intending for it to feel emotional to get an overview of the story after having finished it, and finding it fitting to have a timeline scrolling along with the calm ending theme. For the PlayStation Portable version, {{the creation of a new}} opening movie was outsourced to a video design company, chosen specifically for one designer working there. Nakazawa sent them instructions on what text and graphics to use, and they created an animatic based on it, before adding the details. The ending <b>movie</b> <b>for</b> this version {{was created by the}} publisher, Cyberfront, without Nakazawa's involvement.|$|E
