40|$|The <b>macrofunction</b> in {{computer-aided}} manufacturing (CAM) is executed besed on a macrocode which is transformed {{by a series}} of operations input by the user. By the use of this function and a frame of a macrocode (macrotemplate) on mechanical parts, we have developed a function for transforming macrocode from data of a CAD drawing to a CAM drawing. However, {{it is very difficult to}} build the macrotemplate in the knowledge base, because to do that it must understand CAM operations very well, and the macrotemplate should be tailored to the object. In this paper, we describe a method for generating the macrotemplate automatically, and demonstrate that we have been able to achieve NC machining easily...|$|E
40|$|The <b>macrofunction</b> in Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) {{systems is}} {{executed}} {{based on the}} macrocode which is transformed {{by a series of}} operations input by the user. By the use of this function, operations which should be performed by the user can be simplified. Therefore, if the transformation from mechanical drawings to NC code can be changed directly into macrocode, NC machining can be achieved easily. In our study, a function for transforming macrocode from data of a CAD drawing to CAM data is developed. However, drawing data of a CAD system (CAD drawing) does not always coincide with drawing data of a CAM system (CAM drawing), because in a CAM system, restricted conditions, such as machining conditions, must be considered. Consequently, drawing data must be represented by a structure and function which include information about restricted conditions. Thus, the concept of the relationship between "master and servant" for expressing structure and function in an object model definitely is specifically incorporated. As a result, even in the case where structure and function are changed, the knowledge base can be consistently maintained. This paper describes representation of knowledge in the knowledge base and a method for generating a macro code using this knowledge base...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a taxonomy based on pragmatic criteria {{which aims to}} establish the most relevant functions of silence in colloquial conversations in Spanish. With this end, we have analysed a corpus of spontaneous conversations of 15 hours in which 10 young informants with higher education (five women and five men) interact. The {{results of the study}} reveal at least four major types or <b>macrofunctions</b> of silence: 1. discursive, 2. structuring, 3. epistemological and psychological and 4. normative. These functions contain several micro- functions or pragmatic realizations (intensification, reformulation, turn of speak assignation, dissention, reflection, being cautious, etc.) that recur with special frequency in exchanges where young people participate. ...|$|R
40|$|Better {{methods of}} psychosocial {{research}} with people affected by AIDS are required; and narrative analysis {{may help to}} meet this need. It {{is based on the}} assumption that people create meaning in events by telling stories about them, and that these stories can be identified in interviews. The paper examines some conceptual issues underlying the method: the psychosocial functions of narratives, their structure, their embeddedness in interview responses, their linguistic <b>macrofunctions</b> and the concept of core narrative. An account of the method is provided, together with two alternative ways of doing it. Then the results of a small study of the value of the narrative analysis for the research interviews of HIV-infected men are reported, with the answering of questions about its consistency and usefulness and brief account of the 12 narratives identified by the method. Some questions were answered in the affirmative but others were not. However, the narratives identified proved both vivid and useful. Evaluations of the study and of the method led to recommendations that narrative analysis be used to augment other methods in AIDS research. AIDS HIV-infection narrative narrative analysis psychosocial methodology...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{appears in}} three parts: Modules I, II, & III. The {{purpose of these}} units was to argue that Generation 1. 5 (G 1. 5) {{learners}} are a distinct group of English language learners with unique ways of representing themselves in academic writing, and to identify those salient linguistic differences among G 1. 5, traditional ESL, and NS student writers. Using multiple methodologies, the text explores the discourse patterns of G 1. 5 students in their academic writing. Elements in each section include: Module I: o A discussion and literature review of research on Generation 1. 5 students and design criteria for an extended corpus study. Module II: o A pilot study of early results from a corpus study comparing G 1. 5, ESL, and NES student academic writing, with a focus of pronoun and modal use. Module III: o A study involving surveys and interviews to evaluate what both students and instructors consider good academic writing and expect of student essays. o Corpus data from G 1. 5, ESL, and NS student corpora to determine lexicogrammatical and syntactic patterns in G 1. 5 student writers and how they differ from both ESL and NS students. Salient features are analyzed using a framework where features are mapped onto an adapted version of Halliday‘s (2004) three <b>macrofunctions</b> of language, allowing for an analysis of semantic and lexico-grammatical features in terms of ideational, interpersonal, and textual positioning. o Case studies of three essays to test corpus results and a framework of selfrepresentation against individual performance. The resulting text concludes that G 1. 5 students‘ self-representation in writing is distinct from other student writers, and manifests in their semantic choices, narrative style, and elements of a hybrid of academic and personal/interpersonal writing...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with a special problem of inductive synthesis of recursive functional programs. Starting point for induction is {{a complete set of}} example computations in a nite domain. The example computations are mainly obtained by a problem solver in form of an initial shortest path tree spanning the problem graph. It is shown that the initial tree can be automatically transformed into a finite initial program. Induction (generalization-to-n) results in a program which transforms each initial state of any problem domain which is a recursive extension of the given fiite domain into the desired output. Programs are represented in an abstract way by terms, i. e., elements of a term algebra. Thus, our approach is simultaneously an example of the design of recursive algorithms from finite cases. The core of our investigations is to detect sub-structures in the finite initial trees playing the role of "macro-functions" (sub-routines). As compared to the "macro-operators" used in planning the main point of our approach is the de nition of macros containing all cases (operation sequences) reaching the corresponding goal including the trivial one that the goal is already true in a state. A special case of macro-induction is the invention of complex (recursive) predicates. We show that in some cases induction can only be performed after the introduction of the detected <b>macrofunctions,</b> considering them as elementary functions in a new, extended term algebra. In the special cases considered in this paper, the programs which can be induced after the introduction of macro-functions are linear or linear recursive, i. e. have a macro-structure which cannot easily be seen in the set (tree) of initial example computations. At the end of the paper, cognitive aspects - especially con [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Voice in {{academic}} writing {{has become one of}} the most significant concepts in second language writing research and applied linguistics today. Voice research is replete, however, with difficulty due to conflicting definitions of voice, theoretical frameworks, and diverse views regarding the role of voice in writing pedagogy. The research suggests that authorial voice is significant in terms of the writer‟s acquisition of dominant academic conventions, denoting membership of high capital academic communities (Hyland, 2002). It is also evident that the interstice between authorial voice in the target language and non-native speakers is marked by the struggle to negotiate, adapt, acquire, and, also, to resist certain disciplinary and academic voice practices. Empirical studies of voice have, to date, considered the reader reception of voice as well as the presence of expressivist linguistic items in texts. There is limited research which focuses on, first, the linguistic resources which writers use to construct voice, and, second, the voices which non-native speakers construct in their L 2 (second language) texts. This study explores the authorial voice types constructed in the academic texts of Chinese international students by detailing the linguistic items employed to construct voice. The study, further, views voice as a form of self-representation, and implements Ivanic and Camps‟ (2001) pioneering voice typology as derived from Halliday's (1985) <b>macrofunctions.</b> This typology is unique within voice research as it embeds authorial voice within the whole language system. By focusing on the academic discourse of Chinese international students, this study also contributes to present understandings of Chinese background students as writers in the Australian tertiary context. This research comprises a qualitative research design with the primary methodology grounded in a text analysis. The study involved four participants and eight texts. Ivanic and Camps‟ voice typology was applied to the eight texts resulting in a detailed overview of the voice types constructed in the texts. Ivanic and Camps‟ (2001) voice framework provided descriptive codes for data analysis, and interpretive codes were also implemented to strengthen the analysis. The results of the text analysis indicate that Chinese international students construct a diverse range of voice types in their L 2 texts which both align with, and, also, challenge the high capital voice types of the academic discourse community. The results indicate that voices in texts are often conflicting, dynamic, and agentive. The findings also provide a detailed study of the textual choices and resources used by the participants to create authorial voice. The limited nature of the deficit approach as applied to the L 2 academic discourse of Chinese international students is also underscored in the findings of this study. The implications of the research are outlined and include the importance of constructing credible authorial voices in order to gain membership of particular academic communities as well as the central role of voice in specifying the agency of non-native speakers as writers. The importance of further text-based, author focused voice research is also suggested...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to discuss}} the possibilities of reworking television genres, due to transmedia phenomenon, which takes those genres to digital communication platforms. Accordingly to that, the research tries to capture evidences of change in two television genres â the soap opera and the newscast â in the edge of its migration to YouTube video repository. The genre reworking occurs due to two variables. The first one is the change in semiotic regime caused by transmedia phenomenon, whose main impacts are the reconfiguration of language <b>macrofunctions</b> (as conceived by Kress, Van Leeuwen, 1996) and, therefore, {{the change in the}} way semiotic entities manifest themselves. The second one is the adaptation of television genres to a digital genre material basis, conceived as a junction of software and hardware features. In such process, interactional attributes gain relevance, repurposing established relations between participants and opening new possibilities of dealing with television genres. The corpus of research is composed by six videos uploaded on YouTube, which were analyzed according to multimodal theory (KRESS; VAN LEEUWEN, 1996; KRESS, 2010), which covers their compositional, interpersonal and ideational features. Furthermore, the analysis focused the influence of the digital genre material basis on those features. Data collected indicate, first of all, that the genre reworking happens at a creative level. In other words, the genre reworking is capable to give birth to other genres; some of them standardized ones, and some of them emergent ones. In another level, the genre reworking transforms internal features of the analyzed genres, however it is insufficient to create other genres. A presente pesquisa discute as possibilidades de reelaboraÃÃo de gÃneros audiovisuais televisivos por ocasiÃo dos processos transmidiÃticos aos quais sÃo submetidos nos dias atuais, em direÃÃo a plataformas digitais de comunicaÃÃo. Nesse sentido, busca-se flagrar evidÃncias de mudanÃa em dois gÃneros discursivos â a telenovela e o telejornal â ao final de um processo de migraÃÃo para o repositÃrio digital de vÃdeos YouTube. A reelaboraÃÃo de gÃneros ocorre em virtude de duas variÃveis. A primeira Ã a mudanÃa do regime semiÃtico ocorrida na transmidiaÃÃo, cujos principais impactos consistem na reconfiguraÃÃo das macrofunÃÃes da linguagem (tais como concebidas por Kress; Van Leeuwen, 1996) e, por conseguinte, na maneira como as entidades semiÃticas passam a se manifestar. A segunda Ã a adaptaÃÃo dos gÃneros televisivos ao suporte digital, por nÃs concebido como a conjunÃÃo de softwares e hardwares especÃficos. Em tal processo, atributos interacionais ganham relevo, implicando em reposicionamentos nas relaÃÃes estabelecidas entre participantes e nas possibilidades de fruiÃÃo dos gÃneros audiovisuais. Num corpus composto por seis vÃdeos postados no site YouTube, realizou-se uma anÃlise Ã luz da teoria multimodal (KRESS; VAN LEEUWEN, 1996; KRESS, 2010), contemplando de aspectos composicionais, interpessoais e representacionais, alÃm das ingerÃncias do suporte digital sobre tais aspectos. Os dados revelaram que a reelaboraÃÃo pode se dar, inicialmente, num nÃvel criador, ou seja, capaz de dar origem a outros gÃneros, sejam eles mais inclinados Ã estandardizaÃÃo, de um lado, ou mais inclinados Ã emergÃncia, de outro. Num outro nÃvel, a reelaboraÃÃo altera traÃos internos dos gÃneros analisados, porÃm nÃo Ã suficiente para a criaÃÃo de outros gÃneros...|$|R
