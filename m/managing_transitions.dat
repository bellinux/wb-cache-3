40|$|While the {{literature}} on Sustainability Transitions highlights the role of visions, expectations or scenarios in <b>managing</b> <b>transitions,</b> historical transition studies rarely mention specifically how they may have played. If some authors stress the role of scenarios at the niche level, to align innovative actors behind a common longterm vision, they don’t analyse visions carried by the regime actors. When building a new future vision, actors should always consider the already existing ones, as the regime visions, {{even though they are}} mostly implicit, actually frame the possibilities for transformative change. We aim at providing some insights on the way innovative actors can design future visions as strategic interventions in a transition process.

40|$|While {{the concept}} of {{sustainable}} development brings together concepts of economic, environmental and social sustainability, much has been said regarding inherent tensions between them.

This is explored by looking at a case of sustainable regeneration in Wales, UK. Using {{as a case study}} the Arbed scheme, an area-based project established in 2009 to retrofit housing stock for energy efficiency, this paper shows how the scheme explicitly addresses economic, environmental and social aspects of sustainability; and, in particular, how sustainable development aims constituted a guiding vision that supported the formation of actor and resource networks necessary for large-scale retrofitting...|$|E

We conducted an ethnographic study in two different companies where we observed the experiences and practices of thirty-six information workers.

We discovered that to multi-task and cope with the resulting fragmentation of their work, individuals constantly renew overviews of their working spheres, they strategize how to manage transitions between contexts and they maintain flexible foci among their different working spheres. We argue that system design to support collaborative work should include the notion that people are involved in multiple collaborations with contexts that change continually. System design must take into account these continual changes: people switch between local and global perspectives of their working spheres, have varying states of awareness of their different working spheres, and are continually <b>managing</b> <b>transitions</b> between contexts due to interruptions...|$|E

40|$|Many {{countries}} {{are committed to}} sustainability but are struggling with how to do this. Most countries opted for sustainability councils {{and the development of}} sustainability indicators. The Dutch government followed a different track. It believed that sustainability requires some fundamental changes in functional systems of for example energy, transport and agriculture. It conceptualised the quest towards sustainability as an issue of <b>managing</b> <b>transitions</b> in functional systems. In this paper we examine why the Dutch government became interested in transitions. We will see that transition management was attractive because it allowed different ministries to pursue their own agenda but in a different way: with more attention to innovation and learning. We will look at the model of transition management and the Dutch policies for managing the energy transition. The model is believed to be an interesting model of governance, employing an integrative and multi-scale framework for policy deliberation, choice of instruments, and actions by individuals, private and public organizations, helping society to escape lock-in while avoiding new evolutionary traps...|$|E
40|$|It {{is argued}} that the firm is the {{principal}} source of innovation and growth, a device {{for the establishment of}} technological competence, and for its continued development over time. Markets, products and background knowledge may change quite dramatically over time. Yet {{as a result of the}} cumulative nature of learning in the production processes of firms, the profile of corporate technological competence will tend to persist over quite long periods, provided there is institutional continuity. Within the same firm, competence may evolve into related areas, but the firm's technological origins will remain identifiable in its subsequent trajectories. However, if the institution itself changes more dramatically, this technological persistence may be disrupted. Supporting evidence is provided from data on the patenting of 30 large US and European companies, which have been continuously active since the interwar period. The science and the knowledge base, and the composition of products and markets may shift quite radically, but the firm's productive and technological system itself is potentially more stable. The firm provides a vehicle for potential institutional continuity and a device for <b>managing</b> <b>transitions</b> within the economic system.

40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access until 12 months after publication. Agro-industries have the {{potential}} to catalyse energy access and promote development. Mauritius {{is one of the most}} advanced countries in the use of waste from sugar processing (bagasse) to simultaneously generate heat and electricity (cogeneration) to feed into the grid, but developments have evolved over several decades with complex dynamics between different actors. A multi-level perspective is used in this paper to examine this process and to extract policy lessons for other countries. The analysis shows how policies influenced the development of the bagasse cogeneration niche and changes in the sugar and energy regimes over time. The formation of independent power producers, centralisation of sugar mills, the use of a complementary fuel (coal) in the off-crop season, and targeted financial incentives were important for the development of bagasse cogeneration in Mauritius. Mauritian sugar mills are at the forefront of niche technological and organisational innovations in response to recent reduction in sugar prices. The country has been able to respond to changes and manage niche innovations strategically due to the deployment of finance, technical expertise and strong governance structures which enabled the government to coordinate with industry. Therefore, local capacity and institutional context are important for <b>managing</b> <b>transitions</b> towards sustainable energy...|$|E

40|$|Public {{lands and}} {{waters in the}} United States {{traditionally}} have been managed using frameworks and objectives that were established under an implicit assumption of stable climatic conditions. However, projected climatic changes render this assumption invalid. Here, we summarize general principles for management adaptations that have emerged from a major literature review. These general principles cover many topics including: (1) how to assess climate impacts to ecosystem processes that are key to management goals; (2) using management practices to support ecosystem resilience; (3) converting barriers that may inhibit management responses into opportunities for successful implementation; and (4) promoting flexible decision making {{that takes into account}} challenges of scale and thresholds. To date, the literature on management adaptations to climate change has mostly focused on strategies for bolstering the resilience of ecosystems to persist in their current states. Yet in the longer term, it is anticipated that climate change will push certain ecosystems and species beyond their capacity to recover. When managing to support resilience becomes infeasible, adaptation may require more than simply changing management practices—it may require changing management goals and <b>managing</b> <b>transitions</b> to new ecosystem states. After transitions have occurred, management will again support resilience—this time for a new ecosystem state. Thus, successful management of natural resources in the context of climate change will require recognition on the part of managers and decisions makers of the need to cycle between “managing for resilience” and “managing for change. ...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{publication}} of the Federal Government’s discussion paper 'A Fair Chance for All' (1990) considerable {{attention has been paid to}} maximising the opportunity all Australians have to access and participate in higher education. Recent reviews of the participation of equity groups in tertiary study have identified the continued under-representation of students from rural and remote areas and students from low-SES backgrounds. This paper presents findings and implications for policy and practice from a selected sample of students who attended Queensland schools identified as rural and remote or socioeconomically disadvantaged, and completed Year 12 in 1997. Students surveyed experienced a range of post-school outcomes including TAFE, university, apprenticeships, and unemployment. The Tertiary Entrance Procedures Authority (TEPA) conducted this research as part of its legislated responsibility to identify equity groups who have difficulty accessing information about tertiary entrance and further education. The data collected included both quantitative and qualitative aspects of these students ’ experiences of the information and services provided to them throughout their schooling with respect to their post-school options. The findings of this research will be used to inform current policy on <b>managing</b> <b>transitions</b> to further educational opportunities; improve existing information resources provided by TEPA to Queensland school students; and assist with the development of necessary additional resources.
