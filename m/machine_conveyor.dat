40|$|Over-exposure to noise {{remains a}} widespread, serious health hazard in the U. S. mining {{industry}} despite 25 years of regulation. Most other categories of illnesses and injuries associated with mining have improved, {{with the exception}} of hearing loss. In order to reduce cases of Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL) in the mining industry, retrofit acoustic treatments and controls are being developed to subdue noise at the source. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) coal noise sample data collected from 2000 to 2005 has determined that continuous mining machines rank first among all mining equipment whose operators exceed 100 % noise dosage. The continuous mining <b>machine</b> <b>conveyor,</b> used to move coal from the cutting face {{to the rear of the}} machine, has been identified as a dominant noise source. A dual sprocket conveyor chain was tested as a potential solution. Sound power level measurements conducted at the Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) accredited reverberation chamber showed a 3 dB reduction in the A-weighted sound power level when the dual sprocket chain was implemented. Underground results show an 8 -hour Time Weighted Average (TWA 8 hrs) reduction a 3 dB for continuous mining machine operators.

40|$|Occupational noise-induced {{hearing loss}} {{continues}} {{to be one of}} the most pervasive health problems in the mining industry, despite over 25 years of regulation. One of the loudest pieces of equipment used in underground mining is the continuous mining machine. Noise sample data collected by the Mine Safety and Health Administration indicate that 42 % of noise overexposures between 2000 and 2005 involved continuous mining machine operators. Previously conducted field and laboratory tests have determined that the continuous mining <b>machine</b> <b>conveyor</b> system is a dominant noise source. Loud impacts occur as the conveyor chain flight bars, used to move the mined aggregate, traverse their path from the top to the underside of the conveyor deck. Various noise control treatments have been applied to abate noise caused by the conveyor system. A durable polyurethane coating has been developed for the conveyor flight bars, resulting in a time-weighted average reduction of 3 dB(A) for an eight-hour work shift. In an attempt to further reduce continuous mining machine operator overexposures, a similar urethane coating has been applied to the tail roller component of the conveyor system. Laboratory results showed a 2 dB(A) reduction in sound power levels, but the component failed during underground durability testing. An outer steel sleeve has been added to the urethane coating of the tail roller to enhance wear resistance during mining. The urethane jacketed tail roller is the latest effort, combined with previous noise treatments, to bring the continuous mining machine into compliance with federal noise regulations...|$|E
40|$|Companies {{can lose}} a {{substantial}} portion of their revenues due to deterioration in value of their products as a result of processing impediments, which might occur in the entire supply chain. Sometimes, the reasons for a decline in product quality are not fully understood, and thus there are no appropriate measures taken to prevent it. Yet, it is vital to comprehend what is actually happening during production and material handling so that proper, well-informed decisions can be made. This project deals with one of the unexplored problems [...] quality loss due to product cross-contamination, which is a common occurrence in material handling, multi-product plants. It is a process of mixing product going through multi-purpose equipment and piping with leftover residue that is currently there, which takes place when there is no intermediate cleaning in between two consecutive products, though the precise character of it is usually not known. Omitting cleaning runs to save production time and money is a common practice in the industry. This research introduces a novel simulation method to quantify and predict the extent of cross-contamination as well as to assess its effects. Many models for material handling in multi-product plant {{have been made in the}} past but very few relate to the issue of cross-contamination, which is of extreme importance in quality assurance and informed decision-making. As no similar models have been developed previously, or other research done based on a real industrial setting, it is a truly innovative study, intended to establish foundation for further research, and to raise awareness of the issue by starting to fill a gap of knowledge about what can happen during material processing. Initially, a thorough literature research is done, dealing with issues of trade-offs in manufacturing, cross-contamination in production, as well as how to combine scheduling methodologies with a powder mixing model in a discrete event simulation (DES). Then modelling boundaries and assumptions are established together with a conceptual model. Based on that, a general DES building blocks [...] class models for a bagging <b>machine,</b> <b>conveyor,</b> mixer, silo as well as product batches and orders are created. Specific analysis is performed in Sloten, a young animal feed plant in Deventer, the Netherlands, in order to find a more precise character of cross-contamination over time, as well as to test the model application in a realistic setting. Contamination measurements using tracer [...] collector method over material flow with multiple intermediate sampling points help, together with relevant theoretical models, build mathematical representation of chaotic changes occurring within material flow. Obtained curves fitted with a sum of two exponentially decreasing curves correspond well to the measurements but do not explain everything that happens during the process. Nevertheless they are used to model the cross-contamination phenomenon. Two unique cross-contamination models suitable for implementation in DES are developed, basing on principles of segmentation, quantity conservation, product similarity and proportionality, and are fundamentally models of mixing between material flow and residue in the crossed container. More general one, called partial mass exchange model, allows to customize fraction of material mixed, characteristic to a given piece of equipment, while the other, mixing model, assumes homogeneous resulting composition. Finally, a case-specific simulation model, joining material handling system with cross-contamination calculations as well as customizable layout configuration and settable scheduling methodologies, is established. Experimental setup with four-stage production process consisting of ingredient feeder, a single mixer, limited intermediate storage buffers and multiple system exits, mostly bagging machines, connected by conveying equipment, is discussed. All of the machines involved are multi-purpose, flexible but with some limitations, together with the interconnections and logic among them, basing on a genuine example. Analysis shows considerable impact of system layout and scheduling rules on product contamination. In order to limit cross-contamination appropriate product sequencing, minimising the differences between consecutive products in all stages of the process in needed, while that might impede throughput because of resulting constraints. There is thus a trade-off relation among various aspects of production efficiency, as well as amidst that efficiency and flexibility, when number of storage buffers and their capacity is changed. In the end, research first benefits from measuring the extent of cross-contamination, then succeeding in giving an original example of how to build a cross-contamination model, and how to combine it with a stochastic DES, capable of suiting different designs and scheduling methodologies. Performed experiments show, that cross-contamination effects can be reasonably well simulated with a DES model. It also describes possible effects of certain interventions on various performance indicators, and demonstrates possible risks of increasing flexibility in the system. Additional, more thorough trials are needed in the future to improve the model and generalise it further. Yet, the very important first step to understand the issue has been taken, which will aid in application to other types of systems as well as help in mitigating product contamination.

40|$|Warehouses are {{important}} nodes in supply chains. They decouple supply from demand in time, assortment, quantity, and space. By doing so, {{economies of scale}} can be achieved in transport, as warehouses allow to regroup transport flows leading to lower cost. They also allow postponement of value addition, increasing service levels at lower inventory levels. Warehouses are particularly needed in densely populated areas, close to where demand is generated and where the labor is available. Warehouses require much space to realize economies of scale. Warehouse buildings are often quite large, more than 10, 000 m 2 built space is common, and much infrastructure outside the building is needed. Unfortunately, {{in many of the}} urbanized areas, space for such large facilities has become short. In order to address this issue, enterprises are moving toward next generation storage systems, namely “three-dimensional (3 D) compact storage systems”. These systems are designed in order to save floor space and labor costs, and increase the reliability of the order picking process. Several types of 3 D compact storage systems exist with different handling systems (like S/R <b>machines,</b> <b>conveyors,</b> shuttles, or elevators) taking care of the horizontal, vertical and depth movements. This dissertation focuses on new types of 3 D compact storage systems, in particular live-cube storage systems, where each unit load rests on a shuttle which can move in horizontal and depth directions, in cooperation with shuttles of other unit loads. In such a system, at least one empty storage slot per level is required. One of the key performance measures for compact storage systems, which is also the focus of this dissertation, is response time. We analyze these systems at two decision-making levels. At the tactical (design) decision level, we focus on the rack-dimensioning problem aiming at short response times. At the operational decision level, we investigate storage assignment and retrieval sequencing problems to shorten the response time...|$|R
