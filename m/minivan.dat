5|$|During {{the scene}} where Ray's stolen <b>minivan</b> is {{attacked}} by a mob, Janusz Kaminski and Spielberg wanted a lot of interactive lights, so they added different kinds of lights, including Coleman lamps, oil lanterns, flashlights and Maglights. The IL crew admitted that {{the destruction of the}} Bayonne Bridge was the toughest scene to be made with heavy usage mix of CGI effects and live action elements, and a four-week deadline so the shot could be used in a Super Bowl trailer. The scene originally had only a gas station exploding, but then Spielberg suggested blowing up the bridge as well. The scene involved Tripods shooting a Heat-Ray towards the <b>minivan</b> and <b>minivan</b> escapes from it involved a lot of CGI layers to work out. Over 500 CGI effects were used in the film.|$|E
