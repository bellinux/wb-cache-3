5|$|Contemporary written sources about Mindaugas {{are very}} scarce. <b>Much</b> <b>what</b> {{is known about}} his reign is {{obtained}} from the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle and the Hypatian Codex. Both of these chronicles were produced by enemies of Lithuania and thus have anti-Lithuanian bias, particularly the Hypatian Codex. They are also incomplete: both of them lack dates and locations even for the most important events. For example, the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle devoted 125 poetry lines to Mindaugas's coronation, but failed to mention either the date or the location. Other important sources are the papal bulls regarding baptism and coronation of Mindaugas. The Lithuanians did not produce any surviving records themselves, except {{for a series of}} acts granting lands to the Livonian Order, but their authenticity is disputed. Due to lack of sources, some important questions regarding Mindaugas and his reign cannot be answered.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} part of Scouting education is the personal example of the leader. The Scout is impressed by the leader because of his age, his knowledge, and his position as a leader. If the leader is popular, leadership {{will be seen as}} an attractive goal, and the Scout will follow the example of the leader. The Scoutmaster living the Scout law will have more influence than one who simply talks about it. In the boys' eyes it is what a man does that counts and not so <b>much</b> <b>what</b> he says.|$|E

Spencer described Five Finger Death Punch as [...] "kind of like stepping on a garden rake while looking at a supermodel. Blissful yet fucking devastating". He then said, [...] "We have an energy and a rhythmical style that's different than what's happening out there. We have songs that grab you and stay with you and rip your face off.

The powers that be are only as interested in you as they think you are in the job. For me it's about more than turning up and saying the lines. It's about understanding it and trying to make it better. That's actually a lot of fun. What's great is nobody says, 'Just shut up.' They want you to work at it. [...] I surprise myself sometimes because after {{two and a half years}} sometimes I see friends on the side of a poster and I think, 'do I want to do something else?' but I really like this job, I never get that awful ‘dread’ feeling when you really don’t want to go into work." ...|$|E
500|$|Friedman was a {{supporter}} of the candidacy of Barry Goldwater against Lyndon Johnson following Kennedy in 1964. Later, he served as a member of President Reagan's Economic Policy Advisory Board starting at 1981. In 1988, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the National Medal of Science. He said that he was a libertarian philosophically, but a member of the U.S. Republican Party for the sake of [...] "expediency" [...] ("I am a libertarian with a small 'l' and a Republican with a capital 'R.' And I am a Republican with a capital 'R' on grounds of expediency, not on principle.") But, he said, [...] "I think the term classical liberal is also equally applicable. I don't really care very <b>much</b> <b>what</b> I'm called. I'm much more interested in having people thinking about the ideas, rather than the person." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Bennett, in 1994, {{discussed}} the poem's effectiveness: [...] "What {{is important and}} compelling in this poem is not so <b>much</b> <b>what</b> happens on the urn or in the poem, but {{the way that a}} response to an artwork both figures and prefigures its own critical response". In 1999, Andrew Motion claimed that the poem [...] "tells a story that cannot be developed. Celebrating the transcendent powers of art, it creates a sense of imminence, but also registers a feeling of frustration." [...] Ayumi Mizukoshi, in 2001, argued that early audiences did not support [...] "Ode to Psyche" [...] because it [...] "turned out to be too reflexive and internalised to be enjoyed as a mythological picture. For the same reason, the 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' drew neither attention nor admiration. Although the poet is gazing round the surface of the urn in each stanza, the poem cannot readily be consumed as a series of 'idylls'." ...|$|E

James Poniewozik of Time called it a [...] "solid" [...] episode, one which was [...] "neither awful nor amazing", but set up promising storylines for the season ahead. He felt there were no stand out musical performances, but commented, [...] "it gave the season some emotional grounding [...] It showed us a Glee that's not working double-time to give us everything we want all at once, and that's pretty <b>much</b> <b>what</b> I want from it." [...] John Doyle of The Globe and Mail wrote that, with [...] "Audition", Glee had become formulaic, and asserted that [...] "Glee fanatics won't be disappointed. The rest of us are." ...|$|E
500|$|Blue Shift {{received}} a mixed reaction from critics, holding overall scores of 67.40% and 71/100 [...] on the review aggregator sites GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively. The game has sold around 800,000 copies at retail (this figure {{does not include}} later sales on Steam). In a review for IGN, critic Tal Blevins noted that Blue Shifts gameplay [...] "is pretty <b>much</b> <b>what</b> we've come to expect out of Half-Life" [...] by blending action and puzzle solving, stating that the latter [...] "were all logical and well done, {{although some of the}} jumping puzzles were frustrating". Though IGN praised the game for maintaining the [...] "epic" [...] feel of the original, Blevins was critical of the relatively short length of the game. GameSpot reviewer Greg Kasavin agreed with many of IGN's criticisms, stating that [...] "it's not that the game is easy so much that it's extremely short" [...] and that Blue Shift [...] "doesn't amount to much on its own terms". In addition, Kasavin described the graphical enhancements brought about by the High Definition pack as [...] "helpful", but noted that [...] "they still don't make Half-Life look like a new game—nor are many of the changes themselves very noticeable".|$|E
500|$|Not all reviewers {{gave the}} film {{positive}} reviews. New York magazine's David Edelstein claimed {{in his review}} to [...] "have no idea what {{so many people are}} raving about. It's as if someone went into their heads while they were sleeping and planted the idea that Inception is a visionary masterpiece and—hold on ... Whoa! I think I get it. The movie is a metaphor for the power of delusional hype—a metaphor for itself." [...] Rex Reed of The New York Observer explained the film's development as [...] "pretty <b>much</b> <b>what</b> we've come to expect from summer movies in general and Christopher Nolan movies in particular ... doesn't seem like much of an accomplishment to me." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times commented [...] "there is a lot to see in Inception, there is nothing that counts as genuine vision. Mr. Nolan's idea of the mind is too literal, too logical, and too rule-bound to allow the full measure of madness." [...] David Denby, writing in The New Yorker, considered the film not nearly as much fun as Nolan imagined it to be, concluding, [...] "Inception is a stunning-looking film that gets lost in fabulous intricacies, a movie devoted to its own workings and to little else." ...|$|E

500|$|Night of the Blood Beast was one {{of several}} films {{produced}} by B movie filmmaker Roger Corman and his brother, Gene Corman. The two also partnered together in making Hot Car Girl (1958), Beast from Haunted Cave (1959), Attack of the Giant Leeches (1959) and The Premature Burial (1962). Jerome Bixby, the science fiction screenwriter who wrote It! The Terror from Beyond Space (1958), was originally approached for the job, but Bixby was working on another project and recommended his close friend Martin Varno for the job. Varno, the son of veteran actor Roland Varno, was 21 years old at the time. He met with Roger and Gene Corman, who discussed with him what Varno called [...] "some sort of a weird idea for the picture". They offered Varno a couple hundred dollars for the job, which was below the minimum compensation rates known as [...] "scale", but Varno {{was not part of the}} Writers Guild of America at the time and did not know about the guidelines. He accepted the offer and signed a contract. Although Varno had a rough idea it would be a low-budget film, he said the Cormans set no specific guidelines for him: [...] "I gave them the impression that I knew pretty <b>much</b> <b>what</b> I was doing, and they sort of got the idea that I wasn't going to use 50,000 extras and things." ...|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V.

But I'd say it fits in nicely with the general run of {{competency}} to excellence we've been seeing so far this season. It was modestly funny, a little sweet, and not at all horrible." [...] Alan Sepinwall from HitFix who is not a fan of Elaine Stritch's role on the show enjoyed her in this episode, writing that along with the appearances of Elizabeth Banks and Alan Alda [...] "I decided to hope their presence would counteract my feelings about hers – which is pretty <b>much</b> <b>what</b> happened." [...] Sepinwall enjoyed the subplots commenting that Tracy's [...] "played well" [...] and Jenna and Paul's [...] "was both sweet and ridiculous". Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student said it was [...] "a ton of fun to watch" [...] all the subplots play out and considered [...] "Christmas Attack Zone" [...] as [...] "probably one of the two or three best episodes of the season thus far. In fact... {{it may have been the}} best Christmas episode of 30 Rock yet." [...] Johnny Firecloud of CraveOnline enjoyed Stritch and Alda's [...] "wonderfully funny roles".|$|E
500|$|Beholder {{initially}} {{developed a}} reputation as a [...] "temperamental diva." [...] As a young filly, she was prone to rearing when she got upset and later turned to bucking. [...] But the people who worked with her every day viewed her differently; her exercise rider in 2013, David Nuesch, described her as [...] "straightforward", explaining, [...] "she kind of likes it to be her idea and doesn't want to be told too <b>much</b> <b>what</b> to do." [...] Her groom, Ruben Mercado, said she was a [...] "little angel" [...] in the stables but [...] "all business" [...] on the track. Mandella used earplugs and a hood with ear coverings (colloquially called [...] "earmuffs") to help keep her focused. At one point, he tried giving her ear buds, but the sound upset her even more. Mandella was described as the [...] "perfect" [...] trainer for her, as he was willing to try different training techniques to keep her from getting in her own way, took the time to figure out her quirks, and learned to anticipate her behavior. [...] The bond and depth of communication between trainer and horse was noted in the press. Mandella's son Gary described Beholder as having an [...] "Alpha Male perspective," [...] explaining, [...] "She’s actually dominant, bullyish and head strong. She’s not quirky because she’s worried that something is lurking around the corner. The things that she does that are hard to manage are because she’s tougher than you." ...|$|E

500|$|British {{graffiti}} {{artist and}} political activist Banksy {{is credited with}} creating the opening titles and couch gag for this episode, in what amounted to {{the first time that}} an artist has been invited to storyboard the show. Executive producer Al Jean first took note of Banksy after seeing his 2010 film Exit Through the Gift Shop. According to Jean, [...] "The concept in my mind was, 'What if this graffiti artist came in and tagged our main titles?'" [...] Simpsons casting director Bonnie Pietila was able to contact the artist through the film's producers, and asked if he would be interested in writing a main title for the show. Jean said Banksy [...] "sent back boards for pretty <b>much</b> <b>what</b> you saw." [...] Series creator Matt Groening gave the idea his blessing, and helped try to make the sequence as close to Banksy's original storyboards as possible. Fox's standards and practices department demanded some changes, and Jean agreed to them [...] "for taste"; Jean said that [...] "95 percent of it is just the way he [...] wanted," [...] but declined to say what was in the censored 5%, only saying that the original version was [...] "even a little sadder." [...] In January 2011, Banksy published the original storyboard on his website. It appears that a poster of Rupert Murdoch could be the 5% that was left out of the final cut.|$|E

The Blu-ray looks superb, as if they shot a (very) low-budget Doctor Who movie late in 1969, which is pretty <b>much</b> <b>what</b> they did.
