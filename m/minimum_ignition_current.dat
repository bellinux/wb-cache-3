The effects of the addition of inert solids are described and a simple model is proposed to represent the experimental results. Generally, increasing inert solid content in a powder leads to a higher <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> energy as well as a higher <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> temperatures in cloud and in layer.

40|$|As a dust {{explosion}} {{is regarded as}} a serious hazard in the industry, knowing the sensitivity of combustible dusts helps to calculate the explosion risk. Also mixtures of a less flammable dust with a combustible dust are often encountered in the process industries. One of the important parameters in determining the ignition sensitivity is the <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> energy (MIE). The aim of this work is to determine crucial ignition energies for different types of combustible dusts of various particle sizes. Experiments are performed to determine the <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> energy of pure dusts and also of different powder mixtures in air. They illustrate that by adding a small amount of a highly combustible powder (such as niacin, lycopodium and metal powder) with a less flammable powder (such as wood, cacao and South African coal) has a considerable effect on the MIE. There is a significant decrease in <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> energy when the fraction of the highly combustible dust exceeds 10 %. After mixing with more than 50 % of the highly combustible dust, the <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> energy decreases gradually. In addition for the ignitable mixtures, the <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> energy was calculated by means of a harmonic model and gave a satisfactory agreement with the experimental obtained values.

Three coal dusts: Indonesian Sebuku coal, Pittsburgh No. 8 coal and South African coal were tested. Experimental {{results showed that the}} dust explosion risk increases significantly with increasing O 2 mole fraction by reducing the <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> temperature for the three tested coal dust clouds dramatically (even by 100 °C). Compared with conventional combustion, the inhibiting effect of CO 2 was found to be comparatively large in dust clouds, particularly for the coal dusts with high volatile content. The retardation effect of the moisture content on the ignition of dust clouds was also found to be pronounced. In addition, a modified steady-state mathematical model based on heterogeneous reaction was proposed to interpret the observed experimental phenomena and to estimate the ignition mechanism of coal dust clouds under <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> temperature conditions. The analysis revealed that heterogeneous ignition dominates the ignition mechanism for sub-/bituminous coal dusts under <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> temperature conditions, but the decrease of coal maturity facilitates homogeneous ignition.

The first step taken for this purpose consisted in measuring the <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> energy of more than 60 commercial flock samples on a <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> energy apparatus optimized for high spark energies.

If the fines content can accumulate, it is, however, possible that even much lower values can be reached.

40|$|The {{existence}} of flammable aerosols presents a high potential for fire hazards {{in the process}} industry. Various industrial fluids, most of which operate at elevated temperatures and pressures, can be atomized when released under high pressure through a small orifice. Because of the complexity {{in the process of}} aerosol formation and combustion, the availability of data on aerosol flammability and flame propagation behaviors is still quite limited, making it difficult to evaluate the potential fire and explosion risks from released aerosols in the process industry and develop safety measures for preventing and/or mitigating aerosol hazards. A study is needed to investigate the relationship between aerosol combustion behaviors and the properties of the aerosols. This dissertation presents research on the combustion behaviors of flammable aerosols. Monodisperse aerosols created by industrial heat transfer fluids were generated using electrospray. The characteristics of flame propagations in aerosols and the influence of the presence of fuel droplets in the system are studied in the aerosol ignition tests. Flames in aerosols are characterized by non-uniform shapes and discrete flame fronts. Flames were observed in different burning modes. Droplet evaporation was found {{to play an important role}} in aerosol burning modes. Droplet evaporation behaviors and fuel vapor distributions are further related to aerosol droplet size, droplet spacing, movement velocity, and liquid volatility. The burning mode of a global flame with rapid size expansion is considered the most hazardous aerosol combustion scenario. This burning mode requires a smaller droplet size and smaller space between droplets. Larger droplet sizes and spacing may hinder the appearance of global flames. But when the liquid fuel has a certain level of volatility, there is an uneven distribution of fuel vapor in the system and this may cause the unique phenomenon of burning mode variations combined with enhanced flame propagation speed. Using an integrated model, the <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> energy values of aerosols were predicted. The aerosol <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> energy is influenced by the fuel-air equivalence ratio and the droplet size.

40|$|AbstractFollowing a {{previous}} explosion screening study, {{we have conducted}} concentration and ignition energy scans on several carbonaceous nanopowders: fullerene, SWCNT, carbon black, MWCNT, graphene, CNF, and graphite. We have measured minimum explosive concentration (MEC), <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> energy (MIE), and <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> temperature (MITcloud) for these materials. The nanocarbons exhibit MEC ~ 101 – 102 g/m 3, comparable to the MEC for coals and for fine particle carbon blacks and graphites. The nanocarbons are confirmed mainly {{to be in the}} St- 1 explosion class, with fullerene, at KSt~ 200 bar-m/s, borderline St- 1 /St- 2. We estimate MIE~ 102 – 103 J, an order of magnitude higher than the MIE for coals but an order of magnitude lower than the MIE for fine particle graphites. While the explosion severity of the nanocarbons is comparable to that of the coals, their explosion susceptibility (ease of ignition) is significantly less (i. e., the nanocarbons have higher MIEs than do the coals); by contrast, the nanocarbons exhibit similar explosion severity to the graphites but enhanced explosion susceptibility (i. e., the nanocarbons have lower MIEs than do the graphites). MITcloud> 550 °C, comparable to that of the coals and carbon blacks...|$|R
40|$|Laser induced spark {{ignition}} {{offers the potential}} for greater reliability and consistency in ignition of lean air/fuel mixtures. This increased reliability {{is essential for the}} application of gas turbines as primary or secondary reserve energy sources in smart grid systems, enabling the integration of renewable energy sources whose output is prone to fluctuation over time. This work details a study into the effect of flow velocity and temperature on <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> energies in laser-induced {{spark ignition}} in an atmospheric combustion test rig, representative of a sub 15 MW industrial gas turbine (Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery Ltd., Lincoln UK). Determination of <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> energies required for a range of temperatures and flow velocities is essential for establishing an operating window in which laser-induced spark ignition can operate under realistic, engine-like start conditions. Ignition of a natural gas and air mixture at atmospheric pressure was conducted using a laser ignition system utilizing a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser source operating at 532 nm wavelength and 4 ns pulse length. Analysis of the influence of flow velocity and temperature on ignition characteristics is presented in terms of required photon flux density, a useful parameter to consider during the development laser ignition systems...|$|R
