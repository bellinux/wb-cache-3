Pirlo was also frequently compared to fellow former <b>Milan</b> and Italy playmaker Demetrio Albertini early in his <b>Milan</b> career, due to their similar characteristics and style of play. Pirlo was often thought to be Albertini's heir for <b>Milan</b> and the national side; he inherited his nickname the metronome whilst playing at <b>Milan,</b> for the way in which he influenced games by controlling the tempo of his team's play through his direct and efficient passing game in midfield, as well as his ability to make himself available to teammates to receive and distribute the ball.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool {{began to}} exert more pressure, {{although}} all their play {{was in front}} of the <b>Milan</b> penalty area, while <b>Milan</b> were unable to keep possession of the ball. In an attempt to bring about an equalising goal, Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez substituted Mascherano for striker Peter Crouch. <b>Milan</b> had an attack minutes later, but Inzaghi was unable to control the ball. Inzaghi made amends minutes later when he scored Milan's second goal. With Mascherano substituted, Kaká had the space to pick out a pass to Inzaghi, who took the ball {{to the side of the}} Liverpool goalkeeper Reina and rolled it into the net to make the score 2–0 to <b>Milan.</b> Liverpool managed to pull one goal back in the 88th minute when Kuyt scored after Agger had flicked on Pennant's corner.

25|$|The {{report of}} Saint-Cyr's march {{into the hills}} on the 11th reached the Spanish camp promptly. Vives responded by sending Reding and seven battalions of his leading echelon, a total of 5,000 men, to watch the inland road. <b>Milans</b> with 3,000 volunteers was ordered to block the coast road. Though Caldagues begged him to send every {{available}} man to stop the Imperial army, Vives held back at least 16,000 troops to maintain the blockade of Barcelona. Finding the coast road clear, <b>Milans</b> moved to Sant Celoni where his men were defeated. The news of this action on the 15th finally prompted Vives to take an additional 4,000 men and march through the night to reinforce Reding at dawn on 16 November 1808. Caldagues and the remaining 12,000 troops kept up the blockade of Duhesme's troops. Consequently, Saint-Cyr's 16,500 troops only faced 9,000 Spaniards under Vives. <b>Milans</b> and 3,000 more were to the east, recovering from their repulse, while Lazán and 6,000 more were somewhere to the north.|$|R
5|$|Liverpool {{had another}} {{chance in the}} 27th minute. Frantic {{defending}} from <b>Milan</b> to deny the Liverpool forwards a scoring opportunity, led to the ball being passed to Xabi Alonso, whose shot went wide of the <b>Milan</b> goal. A mistake from Jankulovski allowed Gerrard to pass the ball to Kuyt in the penalty area, however Kuyt's shot was blocked by <b>Milan</b> defender Alessandro Nesta. <b>Milan</b> midfielder Gennaro Gattuso was {{the first player to}} receive a yellow card, when he was cautioned in the 40th minute for a foul on Alonso. Minutes later, Alonso fouled Kaká {{on the edge of the}} Liverpool penalty area, giving away a free-kick. The subsequent free-kick taken by Andrea Pirlo deflected off the shoulder of <b>Milan</b> striker Filippo Inzaghi, and into the Liverpool goal. The deflection resulted in the ball being diverted past Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina, who had dived the other way in anticipation of the ball's original trajectory. Replays showed that the ball struck Inzaghi's upper arm on its way to the goal, but the referee did not judge this to have been a handball. Inzaghi later said that while the deflection was intended, he did not intend for the ball to hit his arm. With no further action in the first half, <b>Milan</b> went into half-time leading 1–0.|$|E
5|$|<b>Milan</b> almost {{took the}} lead in the 70th minute, after Dudek dropped a low cross towards Shevchenko, whose effort was cleared off the line by Traore. Gerrard then had a chance to score but he sent his shot over the crossbar. About ten minutes later García could not control a pass from Gerrard which led to a <b>Milan</b> attack, Crespo played the ball back to Kaka, whose {{subsequent}} shot was blocked by Jamie Carragher. A number of substitutions were made before the end of full-time with Liverpool replacing <b>Milan</b> Baroš with Djibril Cissé, while <b>Milan</b> replaced Hernán Crespo and Clarence Seedorf with Jon Dahl Tomasson and Serginho respectively. <b>Milan</b> had the last chance before full-time but Kaka failed to direct Jaap Stam's header towards goal, meaning the final would go to extra time for the 13th time in the competition's history.|$|E
5|$|<b>Milan</b> {{were drawn}} against German team Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals. The first leg at the San Siro {{ended in a}} 2–2 draw after Bayern had scored an {{equaliser}} three minutes into stoppage time. The second leg at Bayern's home ground the Allianz Arena was more comfortable for <b>Milan,</b> as they scored two first half goals to win the match 2–0 and win the tie 4–2 on aggregate. <b>Milan</b> were drawn against English team Manchester United in the semi-finals. The first leg at United's home ground Old Trafford, Kaka scored twice to give <b>Milan</b> a 2–1 lead after Cristiano Ronaldo had scored an early goal. However, two goals from Wayne Rooney {{in the second half}} meant United won the first leg 3–2. The second leg at the San Siro saw <b>Milan</b> win 3–0 to progress to the final after a 5–3 aggregate victory.|$|E
