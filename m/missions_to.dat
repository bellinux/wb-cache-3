5|$|New {{concepts}} for <b>missions</b> <b>to</b> the Neptune {{system to}} be conducted in the 2010s have been brought forward by NASA scientists on numerous occasions over the last decades. All of them identified Triton as being a prime target and a separate Triton lander comparable to the Huygens probe for Titan was frequently included in those plans. No efforts aimed at Neptune and Triton went beyond the proposal phase and NASA's funding on <b>missions</b> <b>to</b> the outer Solar System is currently focused on the Jupiter and Saturn systems.|$|E
5|$|The 45th IBCT {{deployed}} to Afghanistan in 2011 and reunited with the 201st Corps of the ANA, as partners this time, in combined combat operations against insurgent forces in Eastern Afghanistan suffering {{the loss of}} 14 Soldiers but making significant progress in disrupting and destroying insurgent operations while continuing to mentor the ANA and progressively handing off security <b>missions</b> <b>to</b> them. The full brigade mobilized in April 2011, but a late change in the mission diverted the 180th Cavalry and 160th Field Artillery to separate <b>missions</b> <b>to</b> support Iraq operations from Kuwait.|$|E
5|$|Aldfrith's reign is {{considered}} the beginning of Northumbria's Golden Age, which lasted {{until the end of}} the 8th century. The period saw the flowering of Insular art in Northumbria and produced the Lindisfarne Gospels, perhaps begun in Aldfrith's time, the scholarship of Bede, and the beginnings of the Anglo-Saxon <b>missions</b> <b>to</b> the continent.|$|E

5|$|Previous space <b>{{missions}}</b> <b>to</b> comets, such as Giotto and Stardust, were fly-by missions. These missions {{were able}} to photograph and examine only the surfaces of cometary nuclei, and even then from considerable distances. The Deep Impact mission {{was the first to}} eject material from a comet's surface, and the mission garnered large publicity from the media, international scientists, and amateur astronomers.|$|E
5|$|Scottish monasticism {{played a}} major part in the Hiberno-Scottish mission, by which Scottish and Irish clergy {{undertook}} <b>missions</b> <b>to</b> the expanding Frankish Empire. They founded monasteries, often called Schottenklöster (meaning Gaelic monasteries in German), most of which became Benedictine establishments {{in what is now}} Germany. Scottish monks, such as St Cathróe of Metz, became local saints in the region.|$|E
5|$|The 102d Intelligence Wing traces {{its roots}} to the 318th Fighter Group which {{was formed in}} 1942.

5|$|With Tychus {{acting as}} the middleman, the Raiders embark {{on a series of}} <b>missions</b> <b>to</b> find the {{remaining}} pieces of the Xel'Naga artifact, which they sell to the enigmatic Moebius Foundation in order to fund their revolution. Along the way, they meet with Gabriel Tosh, a rogue Dominion psychic assassin known as a Spectre, and Ariel Hanson, a researcher on the Zerg and leader of a small farming colony. The Raiders perform <b>missions</b> <b>to</b> help Tosh procure the raw materials to train new Spectres as well as to aid Hanson as she attempts to secure her colonists who are caught between the Zerg infesting their planets and the Protoss attempting to eradicate the infestation. Horner also arranges a series of <b>missions</b> <b>to</b> undermine Mengsk, recovering intelligence information about his war crimes and broadcasting them across the Dominion. Finally, Zeratul sneaks aboard the Hyperion to deliver a psychic crystal that allows Raynor to share visions involving an ominous prophecy where Zerg-Protoss hybrids and an enslaved Zerg swarm wipe out Humanity and the Protoss. The vision reveals that only Kerrigan has the power to prevent the eradication of all life in the sector and beyond.|$|E

5|$|Also in 1926, Filitti {{was one of}} {{the authors}} of a legal history overview, Contribuții la istoria justiției penale în Principatele române ("Contributions to the History of Penal Justice in the Romanian Principalities"). By means of Iorga's {{academic}} journal Revista Istorică, he also publicized his discovery of a 17th-century Romanian glossary, which emissaries of the Holy See used on their <b>missions</b> <b>to</b> the Danubian Principalities.

5|$|Another {{factor was}} the weather within the {{operational}} theater. The cyclical monsoon patterns {{meant that the}} weather was deplorable for flight operations eight {{months of the year}} (from late September to early May) when rain and fog tended to conceal targets. Lack of adequate all-weather and night-bombing capability made it necessary for the majority of U.S. <b>missions</b> <b>to</b> be conducted during daylight hours, thereby easing the burden on the air defense forces of North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|As many as 15 German Tornados {{undertook}} {{combat operations}} {{as a part}} of NATO's campaign during the Bosnian War; this was the first combat operation for the Luftwaffe since World War II. The Tornados, operating from Piacenza, Italy, flew reconnaissance <b>missions</b> <b>to</b> survey damage inflicted by previous strikes and to scout targets for other aircraft to strike. These reconnaissance missions were reportedly responsible for a significant improvement in target selection throughout the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Jupiter is outside that of Earth, the phase angle of Jupiter as viewed from Earth never exceeds 11.5°. That is, the planet always appears nearly fully {{illuminated}} when viewed through Earth-based telescopes. It was only during spacecraft <b>missions</b> <b>to</b> Jupiter that crescent views of the planet were obtained. A small telescope will usually show Jupiter's four Galilean moons and the prominent cloud belts across Jupiter's atmosphere. A large telescope will show Jupiter's Great Red Spot when it faces Earth.|$|E
