50|$|Blue Vixen was a {{lightweight}} (145 kg) multimode, coherent, pulse-Doppler I band airborne radar, {{developed from the}} previous Ferranti Blue Fox radar, and designed for use on the British Aerospace Sea Harrier FA2. It was a <b>multimode</b> <b>radar</b> for airborne interception and air-to-surface strike roles over water and land, with look-down/shoot-down and look-up modes. Designed from the start to have full AIM-120 AMRAAM compatibility, it was also compatible with Sea Eagle and AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles.|$|E
50|$|The AN/APG-63 and AN/APG-70 are {{a family}} of {{all-weather}} <b>multimode</b> <b>radar</b> systems designed by Hughes Aircraft (now Raytheon) for the F-15 Eagle air superiority fighter. These X band pulse-Doppler radar systems are designed for both air-air and air-ground missions; {{they are able to}} look up at high-flying targets and down at low-flying targets without being confused by ground clutter. The systems can detect and track aircraft and small high-speed targets at distances beyond visual range down to close range, and at altitudes down to treetop level. The radar feeds target information into the aircraft's central computer for effective weapons delivery. For close-in dogfights, the radar automatically acquires enemy aircraft and projects this information onto the cockpit head-up display. The name is assigned from the Army Navy Joint Electronics Type Designation System.|$|E
50|$|Some upgrade {{programs}} {{have found their}} way into the MiG-31 fleet, like the MiG-31BM multirole version with upgraded avionics, new <b>multimode</b> <b>radar,</b> hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) controls, liquid crystal (LCD) color multi-function displays (MFDs), ability to carry the R-77 missile and various Russian air-to-ground missiles (AGMs) such as the Kh-31 anti-radiation missile (ARM), a new and more powerful computer, and digital data links. A project to upgrade the Russian MiG-31 fleet to the MiG-31BM standard began in 2010; 100 aircraft are to be upgraded to MiG-31BM standard by 2020. Russian Federation Defence Ministry chief Colonel Yuri Balyko has claimed that the upgrade will increase the combat effectiveness of the aircraft several times over. 18 MIG-31BMs were delivered in 2014. The Russian military will receive more than 130 upgraded MiG-31BMs, and the first 24 aircraft have already been delivered, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yuri Borisov told reporters on 9 April 2015.|$|E

5000|$|Multi-mode radar, a 3D radar is a HAL {{project of}} which DRDO's LRDE is a {{subsystem}} provider, this project {{to develop an}} advanced, lightweight Multimode fire control radar for the LCA Tejas fighter, has faced stiff challenges and been struck by delay. It has now been completed with Elta's (Israel) assistance. The <b>multimode</b> <b>radar</b> is a greater than 100 km range (detection of a small fighter target), 10 target track, two target engage, lightweight system. It has been revealed that an all new combined signal and data processor had been developed, replacing the original separate units. The new unit is much more powerful and makes use of contemporary ADSP processors. The other radar critical hardware has also been developed and validated, however work remains on the software front. The software for the air-to-air mode has been developed considerably (including search and track while scan in both look up and look down modes) but air-to-ground modes are being still worked upon. The radar development was shown to be considerably more mature than previously thought. At Aero India 2009, {{it was revealed that}} the 3D MMR project has been superseded by the new 3D AESA FCR project led by LRDE. The MMR has been completed with Elta Israel's assistance and now involved Elta EL/M-2032 technology for Air to Ground mapping and targeting. This [...] "hybrid" [...] MMR has successfully undergone trials, and will be supplied for the initial LCA Tejas fighters of which 2 Squadrons have been ordered.|$|E
50|$|The Aeronautic Ministry {{was created}} on January 20, 1941, and absorbed the former Army and Navy {{aviation}} under its command. In 1944 the Brazilian Air Force joined Allied forces in Italy and operated {{there for about}} seven months, this was the FAB baptism in a real conflict. In 1999 after a creation of the Ministry of Defence (MoD), the Aeronautic Ministry changed its designation to Aeronautic Command, but no big changes happened {{to the air force}} structure, it kept almost the same organization it had before.The biggest, and most important, program of the FAB in the last years is the SIPAM (Sistema de Proteção da Amazônia - Amazonian Protection System), the operational part of the SIPAM is known by SIVAM (Sistema de Vigilância da Amazônia - Amazon Vigilance System). The SIVAM is a huge network of radars, sensors and personnel integrated to guard and protect the Amazon Rainforest and its resources. In 2002 the Embraer R-99A AEW&C equipped with the Ericsson Erieye Airborne Radar and the R-99B SR (Electronic Intelligence Gathering version) entered service. The R-99 fleet is one of the principal components of the system, the aircraft are based at Anápolis AB near Brasília and fly 24 hours a day over the Amazonian region.The backbone of the Brazilian combat aviation made up of three types, the Northrop F-5E/F, the Embraer/Aermacchi A-1A/B (AMX) and the Embraer A/T-29 Super Tucano. The F-5s are under a modernisation program called F-5BR program, the aircraft official designation is F-5M. The upgrade is being carried out by Embraer and Elbit; it includes a new avionics suite, a full glass cockpit with three MFDs, HOTAS configuration and a new <b>multimode</b> <b>radar,</b> the Italian Grifo F. The first F-5EM was handed over on September 21, 2005, and it is scheduled at a rate of two aircraft being delivered each month from that date onwards.The A-1s are the main attack/ bomber aircraft of the FAB. There are three squadrons operating the A-1, one of them equipped with the RA-1 variant having a reconnaissance function as its primary role, but retaining all attack capabilities of the A-1. The RA-1s are equipped with RAFAEL's RecceLite reconnaissance system. Like the F-5, the A-1 is under a MLU (Mid Life Upgrade) program as well, this upgrade giving a high commonality between the avionics of the A-1M (MLU aircraft designation), the F-5M and the newly introduced Embraer A/T-29.|$|E

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of nadir versus off-nadir altimetry are reviewed and contrasted and a potentially serious {{problem has been}} pointed out that has been overlooked by earlier investigators, who focused on the nongeophysical error sources in off-nadir altimetry. Spatial gradients of radar cross section on the sea surface, caused by wind or current gradients or the variation of radar cross section with incidence angle, could introduce significant range errors in off-nadir altimeter. This potentially crippling effect can be overcome by leaving the traditional 13 -GHz frequency and implementing the multibeam altimeter at 36 GHz. A multibeam altimeter proposed for the EOS (Earth Observing System) is described {{as well as a}} <b>multimode</b> airborne <b>radar</b> altimeter being developed to study problems inherent in off-nadir altimetry...|$|R
40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{has been}} developed to model the average return power waveforms available from general radar altimeter systems, such as the <b>Multimode</b> Airborne <b>Radar</b> Altimeter (MARA) system operated at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center - Wallops Flight Facility. The algorithm {{is based on a}} convolutional model comprised of three functions: the average flat surface impulse response (FSIR), the radar system point target response (PTR), and the height pdf of the specular points on the sea surface. The FSIR is modified to account for the asymmetric antenna beam used by the MARA system, and then certain properties of this modified SIR are exploited to obtain closed-form expressions that can be rapidly evaluated. An FFT convolution routine is used to further speed up the computations. The result is an algorithm {{that can be used to}} study the effects of pointing errors in surface measurements...|$|R
