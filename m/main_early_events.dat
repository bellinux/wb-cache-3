His feud between Kim McDevitt and Zachary Shane continued for almost the entire year as the two always managing to escape defeat with the help of Creative Control. He and Shane finally met at MCW [...] "Holiday Homecoming", on December 26, 2007, in an 8th Avenue Street Fight.

A rebuttal {{came in the form}} of a video where González urged those involved to [...] "abandon that rubbish" [...] which was followed by the announcement that he was now the legitimate owner of a fraction of the promotion. Despite remaining inactive, he also served as the guest referee of Aniversario's <b>main</b> <b>event.</b> <b>Earlier</b> in the night, González celebrated along his son when the latter won the Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship.|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo better {{constrain}} the Early Paleozoic tectonic {{evolution of the}} western part of the Erguna-Xing'an Block, detrital zircon U-Pb dating was applied on the Ordovician to Devonian sedimentary strata along the southeast part of the China-Mongolia border. Most of the zircons from five sedimentary samples display fine-scale oscillatory growth zoning and Th/U ratios higher than 0. 1, indicating a magmatic origin. All five Ordovician-Devonian samples display the similar age distribution patterns with age groups at ∼ 440 Ma, ∼ 510 Ma, ∼ 800 Ma, ∼ 950 Ma, and few Meso- to Paleo-Proterozoic and Neoarchean grains. This age distribution pattern is similar to those from adjacent blocks in the southeastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt. Considering previous tectonic studies, we propose bidirectional provenances from the Erguna-Xing'an Block and Baolidao Arc. Consequently, a new model was proposed to highlight the Early Paleozoic tectonic evolution of the western Erguna-Xing'an Block, which constrains two <b>main</b> <b>Early</b> Paleozoic tectonic <b>events</b> of the Xing-Meng Orogenic Belt: (a) pre-Late Cambrian collision between Erguna-Kerulen Block and Arigin Sum-Xilinhot-Xing'an Block; (b) the Early Paleozoic subduction of Paleo-Asian Ocean and pre-Late Devonian collision between Erguna-Xing'an Block and Songliao-Hunshandake Bloc...|$|R
5000|$|Records {{of most of}} {{the first}} anniversary show are not found; only three of the matches are documented. On the undercard Raul Romero {{defeated}} Gorila Pogi. The main event featured two non-Mexican competitors, which was not unusual at the time since EMLL founder Salvador Lutteroth primarily used non-Mexicans in the <b>Main</b> <b>Events</b> <b>early</b> in EMLL's history. In the semi-main event Ray Ryan, nicknamed El Tigre ("The Tiger"), from the United States of America was disqualified for excessive violence against his opponent, French-Canadian Stephan Berne. The main event of the show featured a wrestler that would influence Lucha Libre forever as the masked La Maravilla Enmascarada (Spanish for [...] "The Masked Marvel") made his in-ring debut. La Maravilla Enmascarada was the first ever masked wrestler in Mexico, starting a tradition of a majority of Mexican wrestlers wearing masks. Maravilla was actually Ciclon Mackey, an American wrestler that had worked for EMLL since its debut but was being presented as a new wrestler as part of the fictional storylines, or Kayfabe, that professional wrestling employs.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAminaphtone, a drug {{used in the}} {{treatment}} of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), showed a remarkable role in the modulation of several vasoactive factors, like endothelin- 1 and adhesion molecules. We analysed in vitro the effects of Aminaphtone on whole-genome gene expression and production of different inflammatory proteins. ECV- 304 endothelial cells were stimulated with IL- 1 β 100 U/ml in {{the presence or absence of}} Aminaphtone 6 μg/ml. Gene expression profiles were compared at 1, 3, and 6 h after stimulation by microarray. Supernatants of ECV- 304 cultures were analysed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 h by multiplex ELISA for production of several cytokine and chemokines. Microarrays showed a significant down-regulation at all times of a wide range of inflammatory genes. Aminaphtone appeared also able to modulate the regulation of immune response process (down-regulating cytokine biosynthesis, transcripts involved in lymphocyte differentiation and cell proliferation, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction) and to regulate genes engaged in homeostasis, secretion, body fluid levels, response to hypoxia, cell division, and cell-to-cell communication and signalling. Results were confirmed and extended analysing the secretome, which showed significant reduction of the release of 14 cytokines and chemokines. These effects are predicted to be mediated by interaction with different transcription factors. Aminaphtone was able to modulate the expression of inflammatory molecules relevant to the pathogenesis of several conditions in which the endothelial dysfunction is the <b>main</b> player and <b>early</b> <b>event,</b> like scleroderma, lung fibrosis, or atherosclerosis...|$|R
