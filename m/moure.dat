5|$|France hosted England at Colombes on 1 January 1908 for {{the third}} rugby {{encounter}} between the two nations. Although France lost the game 0–19, the press did not consider it a crushing defeat, given that on the previous occasions England had scored 35 points and then 41. During the first half, two French players departed the field injured, {{so that by the}} second half, England had the advantage in numbers and were able to control the game, which at the start had appeared (to the French press) to be well-balanced. The forwards were considered to be at least equal to, if not better, than the English. Guillemin and Duval amongst the forwards, as well as the backs Hubert and <b>Moure,</b> drew praise from Reichel.|$|E
25|$|Pinot gris is a Pinot color sport (and {{can arise}} by {{mutation}} of Pinot noir or Pinot blanc), presumably representing a somatic mutation {{in either the}} VvMYBA1 or VvMYBA2 genes that control grape berry color. Pinot blanc is a further mutation and can either naturally arise from or give rise to Pinot gris or Pinot noir; the mutation–reversion path is multi-directional therefore. The general DNA profiles of both Pinot gris and blanc are identical to Pinot noir; and other Pinots, Pinot <b>moure</b> and Pinot teinturier, are also genetically similarly close. It should be noted therefore that almost any given Pinot (of whatever berry color) can occur as a complete mutation or as a chimera of almost any other Pinot As such, suggestions that Pinot noir is the fundamental and original form of the Pinots are both misleading and highly tendentious. Indeed, if anything, Pinot blanc may be the original human-selected form of Pinot, although given the genetic variability of this longstanding genetic line, thinking of Pinot as a familial cluster of grapes sharing a fundamental and common genetic core is almost certainly nearest the truth. It is this 'core' around which the sub-varietally identifying color variations (blanc, rouge, noir, gris, rose, violet, tenteurier, <b>moure,</b> etc.) occur, along with the more striking chimeric morphological mutation that is Pinot Meunier, and the interesting further mutations of this variety as Pinot Meunier gris and as the non-hairy mutation which the Germans classify as 'Samtrot' (effectively 'Pinot red velvet').|$|E

By 1921 he had graduated MB BS (London) [...] and by 1922 he had taken the surgical exams for the FRCS (Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons) qualification. To gain further experience, he spent periods of time abroad studying with renowned laryngologists: firstly with Emil <b>Moure</b> and Georges Portmann in Bordeaux, France; and secondly with Chevalier Jackson in Philadelphia, USA.

500|$|Manga, anime, {{and video}} game {{publications}} {{and other related}} media have both praised and criticised Sasuke's character. GameSpot's Joe Donson extolled Sasuke's abilities as [...] "badass" [...] but echoed IGN's comments about his [...] "emo" [...] personality. T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews noted that Sasuke fell into the stereotypical [...] "rival" [...] mold of shōnen manga and found him unlikable. On the other hand, Mania Entertainment's Dani <b>Moure</b> praised the fact that Naruto and Sasuke are forced to work together despite their rivalry. <b>Moure</b> liked that, despite their constant competition, [...] "the group [...] come together when they need to". A study which examined whether readers could predict character types based on physical cues found Sasuke to be a ISTJ (Myers-Briggs) character type, making him a foil for Naruto's personality. Rik Spanjers sees the difference between Sasuke (a loner) and Naruto (an optimist) as tragic, arguing that {{the contrast between the}} two protagonists' approach to the world is fundamental to the plot: [...] "Naruto’s strength grows as he gains more loved ones to protect, while Sasuke remains alone and is increasingly absorbed by his quest for revenge." [...] Amy Plumb argues that Kishimoto's use of references to Japanese mythology in Naruto are intended to add additional layers to the story, including Sasuke's clan's heraldic symbol, a fan known as an uchiwa. These fans are used in Japanese myths to exorcise evil, by blowing it away; Sasuke discovers late in the series that {{he has the ability to}} [...] "blow away" [...] the influence of the Nine-Tailed Fox creature sealed inside Naruto.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to the film has generally been positive. Theron Martin from Anime News Network found Conqueror of Shamballa as a very entertaining film [...] "as it has all of the action, flashy magic, comedy, snappy dialogue, drama, and intrigue that made the TV series so great." [...] The few negative points he found about the plot were lack of discussions of morality which were featured in the anime series and that [...] "the writing and plotting just don't feel as sharp as they were for the series." [...] He praised the additional content from the limited edition DVD {{as well as the}} English dub, but criticized the subtitles for having grammatical mistakes. Although Dani <b>Moure</b> from Mania Entertainment did not find the story to be very original, he still favored it due to its mix of themes, turning it into an entertaining film. He also praised the staff from the series, commenting they have done an [...] "admirable job," [...] making the film a [...] "sequel well worthy of bearing the series' name." [...] Chris Johnston of Newtype USA praised it is as [...] "a perfect way" [...] to conclude the TV series, saying it is [...] "a rousing, action-packed and heartrending close." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{publications}} for manga, anime, video games, {{and other}} related media have provided praise and criticism on Sakura's character. IGN writer A.E. Sparrow commented that every anime and manga benefited from a strong female presence that Sakura provided for the Naruto series, although characterizing her as [...] "stereotypically girly". In a review of episode 110 of the anime, IGN celebrated {{the culmination of the}} development of Sakura's character throughout the series and, the growing out of the [...] "girly" [...] personality. GameSpot noted that Sakura's character has largely been used in the series as a form of comic relief, as well as, often stating the obvious. T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews considered Sakura to be a stereotypical echo of similar love interests of protagonists in other shōnen manga, and that she was not likable. On the other hand, she was also regarded as [...] "an interesting character to throw into the mix [...] " [...] by Mania Entertainment's Dani <b>Moure</b> due to how her differences with Sasuke and Naruto help to balance Team 7. In the book New Media Literacies and Participatory Popular Culture Across Borders, Amy A. Zenger notes Sasuke and Sakura's relationship to be popular within fans of the series even though the former does not reciprocate to the latter's feelings.|$|E

This was followed by Carlos Pezoa Véliz' [...] "Entierro de campo" [...] (Country funeral) and [...] "Tarde en el hospital" [...] (Afternoon in the hospital), and Manuel Magallanes <b>Moure's</b> [...] "La casa junto al mar" [...] (Seaside house) and others.

2500|$|The Cercle {{opened up}} other avenues, as well. [...] It both welcomed {{the work of}} mimes outside Paris, {{such as that of}} Hacks from Marseille and <b>Mourès</b> from Bordeaux, and allowed female mimes the freedom to assume male roles: Flicia Mallet, [...] "the {{brightest}} star of the Cercle", was the prodigal of L'Enfant prodigue. [...] Finally, it brought to the fore the possibilities of [...] "modern" [...] pantomime, sometimes arguing, through articles in the press or lectures given {{under the auspices of the}} Cercle, that the genre should dispense with its ties to the Commedia dell'Arte and venture into [...] "realistic" [...] territory. [...] (As early as 1889, the pantomime Lysic by Eugène Larcher had entertained the Cercle audience with a provincial maid's misadventures in Paris.) [...] Thus did the work of the Cercle anticipate such twentieth-century creations as Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp, Jacques Tati's Monsieur Hulot, Red Skelton's Freddie the Freeloader, and Jackie Gleason's Poor Soul.|$|R
500|$|The Tenjho Tenge manga is {{described}} by Chris Beveridge of AnimeOnDVD as an [...] "...engaging mix of action and comedy together while wrapping it all up in a large plot that's fairly dark and really violent at times". Its creator, Oh! great, is known to flavor his works with wanton sex and violence. Oh! great uses sex as {{an important aspect of}} the storyline by using it as a powerful motivator both negatively and positively. He often has his characters contemplate the significance and importance of fighting as well as the meaning of strength. This conscious deliberation of subjective reasoning and objective truth between characters is the most imperative aspect of story and is considered to be rare in manga. Dani <b>Moure</b> of AnimeOnDVD said readers may find that Oh! great's narrative is occasionally hard to follow and at times the plot moves slowly. Oh! great is known for his characters to have unrealistic body proportions, and Tenjho Tenge is no different. The majority of the female characters have [...] "...ultra large breasts..." [...] and the males characters are extraordinarily muscular, but this facilitates the characters personalities to come through in their distinctive features. Overall, the Tenjho Tenge manga is well received having sold over 10.7 million copies, and its volumes regularly being in the top twenty best-selling manga for Japanese Tohan charts and North American Diamond Comic Distributors charts.|$|E
500|$|Anime News Network's reviewers found much {{to enjoy}} {{about the first}} series, {{although}} Theron Martin warns that the first DVD should be [...] "watched in small doses, as trying to tackle {{too much of it}} in one sitting will elevate the suicide rate of your brain cells". Carl Kimlinger comments that [...] "from the moment the words 'School Rumble' come spinning onto the screen, you know you're in for ... undiluted good times", and that the title is [...] "two of the greatest animation non-sequiturs you're likely to see anytime soon". Carlo Santos praises volume six's bizarre comedy, but laments its romantic elements as being too generic. Overall, his rating is mediocre, saying that [...] "although this disc technically marks the end of [...] School Rumble, it's really more of a pause, seeing as how the last few episodes simply ride along with the plot rather than try to reach a dramatic finish". Reviewers from Mania.com followed this pattern; Dani <b>Moure</b> was skeptical of the series' long-term entertainment value, but like fellow reviewer Danielle Van Gorder, found his early indifference fading as the story develops. IGN's Jeff Harris, N.S. Davidson, and David F. Smith gave mostly positive reviews, although Davidson believes the audio and extras had begun to wane by volume five. Jakub Lhota of Reanimated rated the first season an 8/10, stating that he enjoyed it more than some other anime series he had previously watched, and the style—if not always the color—of Funimation's metallic locker artbox for School Rumbles English translation of the first season was welcomed.|$|E
500|$|Several {{publications}} for manga, anime, video games, {{and other}} related media have commented on Shikamaru's character. IGN stated that Shikamaru {{was one of their}} favorite characters in the series, and referred to him as [...] "the poster child for any card-carrying member of Generation X" [...] due to his general lack of enthusiasm and his unwillingness to utilize his potential. In a review of episode 110, IGN praised how Shikamaru managed to transcend his lazy nature in order to take on the mantle of a leader when assigned to lead a team in order to retrieve Sasuke Uchiha and agreed that the decision to make him Chunin was fair. Anime News Network also commented on this development, calling Shikamaru's emergence as [...] "an unlikely hero" [...] {{one of the highlights of}} the arc. In a subsequent review of episode 135, in which the mission to retrieve Sasuke has failed and the members of Shikamaru's team were critically injured, IGN lauded the [...] "great moment" [...] in the episode in which Shikamaru began to cry after learning his friends will recover, and declared that he will be a better leader for the sake of his friends. Mania Entertainment's Justin Rich celebrated his [...] "sheer intellect", calling him [...] "one of the most fascinating characters in the series" [...] and [...] "one of the few truly brilliant fighters in shōnen anime". Dani <b>Moure,</b> another reviewer from the same site, noted about his battle with Temari during the Chunin Exams that it was [...] "one of the better fights involving the supporting players".|$|E

500|$|Several {{publications}} for manga, anime, video games, {{and other}} related media have provided praise and criticism on Kakashi's character. Christopher A. Born regards Kakashi's teaching of Team 7 {{to work as a}} team, even if they have to break the rules, to be reinforcing the Confucian values of the [...] "importance of benevolence and reciprocity". IGN noted the duality of Kakashi's serious persona in combat and his laid back, apathetic countenance when dealing with his students, but accepted that {{he is one of the}} most popular characters in the series. They also commented that Kakashi is one of the more popular characters they have seen cosplayed at anime conventions. Active Anime celebrated Kakashi's abilities, noting that he fell into the overall theme of characters hiding detailed personalities and secrets. T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews derided Kakashi as a stereotypical [...] "Man of Mystery" [...] seen in other shōnen manga, but praised him as being [...] "much more interesting" [...] than the three main characters, and felt that for all intents and purposes, the show could be renamed simply [...] "Kakashi". Mania Entertainment's Dani <b>Moure</b> likes how Kakashi fits into Team 7 because he is a [...] "hilarious character in that sometimes he doesn't seem all that bothered about things and yet is so masterful of his craft." [...] Chris Beveridge from the site stated that Kakashi is his favorite character from the series because of his personality and praised his fight against Pain, and that after its ending, the character gets [...] "a very humanizing moment", making the episode from the battle stand out. Manga author Yoshihiro Togashi found Kakashi's first battle against his students as one of the first series' moments that impressed him due to how the difference in strength between such characters was shown by just making Kakashi read a book during the fight. IGN ranked him as the 15th greatest anime character of all time, saying that [...] "He's a complex character, with an iconic character design and a laid back attitude that just exudes cool." [...] Amy McNulty from Anime News Network highly praised Kakashi's fight against Obito Uchiha due to its animation and the references to the two fighters' childhoods. In 2014, IGN listed him as the best Naruto character when the series ended.|$|E

John Smith from Impuse Gamer commends the film for its [...] "beautiful animation techniques and some great sound sequences". Mania.com's Chris Beveridge commends the Blu-ray Disc version of Brave Story for being [...] "very expansive in its use of the surround channels during some of the action sequences". He also commends the film for its visual quality saying, [...] "on our 50" [...] set at 720p, the only [...] "problems" [...] I could find was that I had to be six inches (152mm) from the screen {{and looking at the}} pixels {{to see some of the}} shiftiness in the animation in the scenes where dark blues and blacks mix". Mania.com's Dani <b>Moure</b> compares the film's [...] "old-fashioned" [...] character designs to Studio Ghibli's. Anime News Network's Brian Hanson criticises the film as [...] "being one of the worst-looking big-budget anime films of recent memory, the story is a mash of bizarre coincidences held together haphazardly by forced and annoying bouts of exposition, with irritating and one-dimensional characters chirping throughout".|$|E

In the 26th annual Animage readers' poll, it took various categories: it was third in [...] "Favorite Anime Series", ninth in [...] "Favorite Episode" [...] (episode 49) and fifth and eighth in [...] "Favorite Male Character" [...] (Ginji and Ban, respectively). It also received positive reviews {{ever since the}} first episode's premier in Japan. For such episode, Anime News Network liked the animations' quality {{as well as the}} main characters Ban and Ginji. The mix between drama and comedy was also well-received, hoping that it will continue like that {{for the remainder of the}} series. DVD Talk's John Sinnott called it a [...] "solid show", enjoying the characters' growth as the series continued. However, he gave a low score the DVDs' presentation mainly due to the lack of extras. While comparing it with the manga, Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment found the anime's introduction more appealing than the manga's, but mentioned various issues already shown in the first episodes of various anime. Bamboo Dong from Anime News Network enjoyed how the story was built during the first season, finding appealing the fact that the characters he found appealing would take part in a larger story arc. Agreeing with Dong, Dani <b>Moure</b> from Mania liked the interaction between the characters, as well as a bigger exploration to some of them. Sinott concluded that the story arc involving the Limitless Fortress was [...] "a good story" [...] due to the expansion in the backgrounds from various of the main characters, but found it relatively longer than previous story arcs. Active Anime writer David C. Jones praised the focus on the anime's second season, liking how many secondary characters got their own episodes, as well as how the comedy was delivered across them, citing the episode focused on Ginji in the hospital as the best one from the season. On the other hand, Beveridge found that in the second season, characters were [...] "overused", but like Jones, enjoyed the focus on other characters as well as the flashbacks exploring them. The anime's last story arc left mixed thoughts to Beveridge who found some of its events predictable or rushed, but still enjoyed the action sequences shown.|$|E
