5|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} is {{the manifestation of}} glucocorticoid excess. It can {{be the result of}} a prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids or be caused by an underlying disease which produces alterations in the HPA axis or the production of cortisol. Causes can be further classified into ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent. The most common cause of endogenous Cushing's {{syndrome is}} a pituitary adenoma which causes an excessive production of ACTH. The disease produces a wide variety of signs and symptoms which include obesity, diabetes, increased blood pressure, excessive body hair (hirsutism), osteoporosis, depression and, most distinctively, stretch <b>marks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> skin, caused by its progressive thinning.|$|E

5|$|The defence {{commissioned}} {{a report from}} Peter Sutherst, a British forensic photographic expert, who was asked in 2008 to examine negatives of the kitchen taken {{on the day of}} the murders and later. In his report, dated 17 January 2010, Sutherst argued that the scratch <b>marks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> red paintwork on the kitchen mantelpiece had been created after the crime-scene photographs had been taken. The prosecution alleged that the marks had been made during the struggle in the kitchen between Bamber and his father, as the silencer, attached to the rifle, had scratched against the mantelpiece. The prosecution said that paint chips identical to the paint on the mantelpiece were found on or inside the silencer.|$|E
5|$|A {{study from}} Currie, Horner, Erickson and Longrich in 2010 {{has been put}} forward as {{evidence}} of cannibalism in the genus Tyrannosaurus. They studied some Tyrannosaurus specimens with tooth <b>marks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bones, attributable to the same genus. The tooth marks were identified in the humerus, foot bones and metatarsals, and this was seen as evidence for opportunistic scavenging, rather than wounds caused by intraspecific combat. In a fight, they proposed {{it would be difficult}} to reach down to bite in the feet of a rival, making it more likely that the bite marks were made in a carcass. As the bite marks were made in body parts with relatively scanty amounts of flesh, it is suggested that the Tyrannosaurus was feeding on a carcass in which the more fleshy parts had already been consumed. They were also open to the possibility that other tyrannosaurids practiced cannibalism. Other evidence for cannibalism has been unearthed.|$|E
5|$|Bite force {{estimates}} for Deinonychus were first produced in 2005, based on reconstructed jaw musculature. This {{study concluded that}} Deinonychus likely had a maximum bite force only 15% that of the modern American alligator. A 2010 study by Paul Gignac and colleagues attempted to estimate the bite force based directly on newly discovered Deinonychus tooth puncture <b>marks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bones of a Tenontosaurus. These puncture marks came from a large individual, and provided the first evidence that large Deinonychus could bite through bone. Using the tooth marks, Gignac's team were able to determine that the bite force of Deinonychus {{was significantly higher than}} earlier studies had estimated by biomechanical studies alone. They found the bite force of Deinonychus to be between 4,100 and 8,200 newtons, greater than living carnivorous mammals including the hyena, and equivalent to a similarly sized alligator.|$|E

5|$|Dani, {{an ethnic}} Kashmiri, {{was born on}} 20 June 1920 in Basna, Central Provinces, India. He {{graduated}} in 1944, with an MA degree, {{to become the first}} Muslim graduate of Banaras Hindu University. He scored highest <b>marks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> exams which earned him a Gold Medal. This also qualified him for a teaching fellowship from the same university. Although he was provided with the grant, he was not allowed to teach due to his religious beliefs. He stayed there for six months. In 1945, he started working as a trainee in archaeology under the guidance of Mortimer Wheeler. At this time, he participated in excavations at Taxila and Mohenjo-daro. He was subsequently posted at the Department of Archaeology of British India at Taj Mahal, Agra. He received his PhD from the Institute of Archaeology, University College London.|$|E
5|$|Gellibrand was {{initially}} educated at Crespigny Preparatory School at Aldeburgh in Suffolk. In 1883 {{the family moved}} to Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany, where he continued his education before completing it at the King's School, Canterbury in 1888 and 1889. After a visit to Tasmania with his mother and sister Annie in 1891, he returned to Frankfurt-am-Main in September 1891 to study for the entrance exam to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. In Frankfurt he met and courted Elizabeth Helena Breul, known as Elsie to her family, who would later become his wife. He passed the entrance exam, topping the list of candidates, which was published on 17 August 1892, and entered on 1 September. He graduated {{at the top of his}} class of 87 on 18 October 1893, and was awarded the General Proficiency Sword for gaining the highest aggregate <b>marks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final exams. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the South Lancashire Regiment (The Prince of Wales's Volunteers) on 21 October 1893, and was posted to its 1st Battalion, then on garrison duty in Birr, County Offaly, in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, in {{preparation}} for independence, Nigeria's first university opened. Known as University College (now the University of Ibadan), it was an associate college of the University of London. Achebe obtained such high <b>marks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> entrance examination that he was admitted as a Major Scholar in the university's first intake and given a bursary to study medicine. It was during his studies at Ibadan that Achebe began to become critical of European literature about Africa. After reading Joyce Cary's 1939 work Mister Johnson about a cheerful Nigerian man who (among other things) works for an abusive British storeowner, he was so disturbed by the book's portrayal of its Nigerian characters as either savages or buffoons {{that he decided to}} become a writer. Achebe recognised his dislike for the African protagonist {{as a sign of the}} author's cultural ignorance. One of his classmates announced to the professor that the only enjoyable moment in the book is when Johnson is shot.|$|E

5|$|On 10 January, Seeadler {{departed}} for Bombay, where her boilers were repaired {{in a major}} overhaul. Workers from the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel were sent to do the work. Seeadler was back in service by May, and on 18 May she departed Bombay, arriving in East Africa on 31 May. Cormoran was meanwhile detached from East Africa and allowed to continue to the Pacific. The {{rest of the year}} was uneventful for Seeadler, though she became briefly involved in political developments in East Africa. The British Jameson Raid into the Transvaal in December 1895 threatened some 15,000 German nationals in the Transvaal, along with the investment of 500million gold <b>marks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country. The German governor considered ordering Seeadler to contribute a landing force to protect the German consul in Pretoria, the capital of the Transvaal, but the defeat of the Jameson Raid rendered the plan redundant. Seeadler nevertheless remained in East Africa while tensions cooled. In mid-February 1896, she went to Cape Town for her yearly overhaul.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} the crime scene in Idaho and meet Detective Yale Abbott. He says they are less sure that the bites were made by a human and draws their {{attention}} to the strange footprint, believing that wild animals fed on the bodies after the fact. Scully points out {{that there is only one}} footprint, which looks ominously human, and that if it were left by an animal there would be more footprints leading to the bodies. Scully and Doggett check out the house and find prints leading upstairs and into the attic. Inside, Scully and Doggett find the missing fingers of the undertaker. They look like they have been regurgitated by something and the claw <b>marks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> attic suggest something was hanging from the rafters.

5|$|Structure C8 is a {{residential}} compound that was accessed from the alley {{running to the}} East Plaza from behind Pyramid C1. The entrance opened onto the alley from a patio situated in the southern portion of the compound. This patio was surrounded on the east, west and north sides by rooms, with the alley to the south. It was floored with stucco and Structure C8 was the only stuccoed residential building {{in the whole of}} the city. The north range of rooms backed directly onto the ravine immediately to the north of Group C; the lower portion of the walls of the west room and of half of the north room still stand. The west room was square while the north room was narrow and probably extended the entire width of the patio. Wear <b>marks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stucco floor indicate that a door once accessed the north room from the west. The workmanship of Structure C8 was of very high quality and indicates that it was the residence of a member of the city's elite. Its proximity to the large pyramid-temple C1 has led archaeologist Henri Lehmann to speculate that it was once the house of the high priest.|$|E

5|$|The Matriculation exam tested {{candidates}} on five subjects: Latin, Greek, Mathematics, Science, and English Literature. By exam-time this dedication to his studies had paid off spectacularly; the 1887 Cape lists placed Jan third overall, {{with the highest}} <b>marks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Colony in Greek. In what had been by any standards a year of tremendous success the latter achievement was especially outstanding; a misunderstanding {{at the start of}} the year led Jan to believe that he would be exempted from the Greek exam â€“ as a result it was a subject which he largely disregarded. Six days before the exam this potentially devastating oversight was exposed â€“ there was now less than a week in which to catch up with a yearâ€™s study. Jan immediately shut himself away in his rooms, spending the next days in total seclusion, working from sunrise to sunset in the attempt to master the grammar and vocabulary upon which he was shortly to be tested. By the time of the exam this hard work had paid off. Within a relatively short period Jan had largely memorised his books and had mastered the Greek language to a remarkable degree.|$|E
5|$|The cousins {{went back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to search for the source of the red paint on the silencer. In the kitchen they found <b>marks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> red paint {{on the underside of the}} mantelpiece above the Aga cooker. DI Cook, a scenes-of-crime officer, took a paint sample from the mantelpiece on 14 August. This was found to contain the same 15 layers of paint and varnish that were in the paint flake found on the silencer. Casts were taken of the marks on the mantel, and the marks were deemed consistent with the silencer having come into contact several times with the mantelpiece. The implication was that the silencer had scratched the mantelpiece during a fight for the gun.|$|E
5|$|Grey reef {{sharks are}} often curious about divers {{when they first}} enter the water and may {{approach}} quite closely, though they lose interest on repeat dives. They can become dangerous {{in the presence of}} food, and tend to be more aggressive if encountered in open water rather than on the reef. There have been several known attacks on spearfishers, possibly by mistake, when the shark struck at the speared fish close to the diver. This species will also attack if pursued or cornered, and divers should immediately retreat (slowly and always facing the shark) if it begins to perform a threat display. Photographing the display should not be attempted, as the flash from a camera is known to have incited at least one attack. Although of modest size, they are capable of inflicting significant damage: during one study of the threat display, a grey reef shark attacked the researchers' submersible multiple times, leaving tooth <b>marks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plastic windows and biting off one of the propellers. The shark consistently launched its attacks from a distance of , which it was able to cover in a third of a second. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File listed seven unprovoked and six provoked attacks (none of them fatal) attributable to this species.|$|E
