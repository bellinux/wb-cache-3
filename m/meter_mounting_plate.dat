50|$|The {{advancement}} of optical erector set perhaps began with educational toys designed for children. These injection molded plastic kits allowed {{the child to}} construct various optical instruments such as a Telescope, microscope, and spectroscope. Perhaps the most advanced erector set for optics was introduced by Spindler & Hoyer in Germany called: Microbench, patent number 2636657 filed on July 13, 1976. It consisted of 40x40 mm square <b>mounting</b> <b>plates</b> with 25 or 30 mm holes at the center, and four 6 mm bores around the edges. If four 6 mm rods were secured on the corners, a second <b>mounting</b> <b>plate</b> could slide along the rods, and secured at any point via set screws. Furthermore, by securing individual lenses within each <b>mounting</b> <b>plate,</b> a telescope could be constructed. A larger system was introduced by Spindler & Hoyer for constructing larger optical experiments: Patent number 3,945,600 filed on Mar 23, 1976. This was called Macrobench which consisted of 150x150 mm <b>mounting</b> <b>plates</b> capable of securing up to 110 mm optical elements. The rods were of course bigger (20 mm in diameter), and were hollow inside. Ith combining these <b>mounting</b> <b>plates</b> much higher precision optical experiments could have been constructed such as an interferometer, etc.|$|R

40|$|The {{elimination}} of hot spots and {{the reduction of}} eddy current losses in bushing <b>mounting</b> <b>plates</b> is an important consideration in transformer design. The currently used bushing <b>mounting</b> <b>plates</b> are either mild steel plates, or mild steel plates with non-magnetic stainless steel inserts or stainless steel plates. The authors calculate the eddy current losses in bushing <b>mounting</b> <b>plates</b> using four different methods; (i) an analytical formulation; (ii) a three-dimensional finite element method (FEM); (iii) from measured values of the initial temperature rise; and (iv) from measured values of the steady-state temperature rise. There is a close agreement between the loss values obtained using these four methods. The analysis {{has resulted in a}} detailed understanding of the loss pattern and temperature rise phenomenon in bushing <b>mounting</b> <b>plates.</b> The authors also analyse tank plates of small pad-mounted distribution transformers. It is shown that judicious use of non-magnetic stainless steel can result in considerable energy savings for pad-mounted transformers. FEM simulations are performed to find out cost-effective materials for the tank plates of the pad-mounted transformers. A T-shaped stainless steel plate is found to significantly reduce the load loss. The results of the simulations have been verified on a 225 kVA pad-mounted transformer...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Compressors are {{fitted with}} <b>mounting</b> <b>plates</b> and is welded to the {{compressor}} bottom {{and through the}} holes of this plate; the compressor gets mounted on to the A/C housing. The vibrations from the compressor get transferred to the A/C housing there by producing noise, which is undesirable. These vibrations will be greater enough to produce noise when the natural frequencies of the compressor, the <b>mounting</b> <b>plate</b> and the A/C housing coincide resulting in resonance. In this work the static analysis of the plate with three different PCDs are modelled and analysed. The natural frequencies of the <b>mounting</b> <b>plate</b> and the corresponding mode shapes are plotted. Three different models have been considered for analysis and the investigations are carried out. The analysis results of the existing model are compared with two different models {{and the results are}} compared. Upon analysis of the three models, the better one out of them is suggested...|$|R

Additional microgravity tests are planned on the Space Shuttle when Shuttle flights are resumed. The primary purpose of this experiment is to evaluate the operation of a mechanically pumped two-phase ammonia system, with emphasis on determining the performance of an evaporative Two-Phase <b>Mounting</b> <b>Plate.</b> The experiment also evaluates the performance of other specially designed components, such as the two-phase reservoir for temperature control, condensing radiator/heat sink, spiral tube boiler, and pressure drop experiment. The 1 -g tests have shown that start-up of the two-phase experiment is easily accomplished with only a partial fill of ammonia. The experiment maintained a constant <b>mounting</b> <b>plate</b> temperature without flow rate controls over a very wide range of heat loads, flow rates, inlet flow conditions and exit qualities.

The prototype TPMPs were tested with ammonia at heat loads over 3000 W (3. 2 W/sq cm) and local heat fluxes of up to 4 W/sq cm. Calculated total heat transfer coefficients from these tests were between 0. 8 and 1. 0 W/sq cm per C. This represents a better than twenty-fold improvement over comparable single-phase heat transfer coefficients. Design diagrams are included...|$|R
