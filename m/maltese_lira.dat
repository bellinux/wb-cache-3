25|$|Pre-decimal British {{sterling}} coinage {{continued to}} circulate in Malta {{for nearly a}} year after it was withdrawn in the UK due to decimilization on 15 February 1971. Then in 1972, a new, decimal <b>Maltese</b> currency, the <b>lira,</b> was introduced, in both coin and banknote form. The lira was initially equal to the pound sterling, however this parity did not survive long after the floating of sterling on 22 June 1972.|$|R

25|$|In 1972–73, smaller designs {{depicting}} the post-independence {{coat of arms}} and denominated in the <b>Maltese</b> <b>lira</b> were issued. This design remained in use from the 1970s to the 1990s, with changes in the coats of arms in 1975 and 1988. A new series with a similar design but with the inscriptions altered to SISA in Maltese and EXCISE in English was introduced in around 1995. Specific types for imported cigarettes were also issued between the 1970s and the 1990s or 2000s. In around 2005, stamps inscribed EXCISE DUTY PAID and printed on silver foil incorporating a security hologram were introduced, and these exist in two designs. In 2017, similar stamps inscribed MT EXCISE were introduced.|$|E

50|$|From 1972 until {{introduction}} of the Euro in 2008, the currency was the <b>Maltese</b> <b>lira,</b> which had replaced the Maltese pound. The pound replaced the Maltese scudo in 1825.|$|E

5000|$|Centesimo (plural centesimi) is an Italian word {{derived from}} the Latin centesimus meaning [...] "hundredth". It was equal to 1/100 of {{currencies}} named lira.

50|$|The Central Bank of Malta (Bank Ċentrali ta’ Malta) is {{the central}} bank of the Republic of Malta. It was {{established}} on 17 April 1968.

50|$|The scudo {{continued}} to circulate {{on the island}} of Malta, which had become a British colony, along with some other currencies until they were all replaced by the pound in 1825, at a rate of 1 pound to 12 scudi using British coinage. Despite this some scudi remained in use and the last coins were withdrawn from circulation and demonetized in November 1886. 1 scudo in 1886 had the spending power equivalent to £3.82 or €4.35 in 2011. The present-day Republic of Malta adopted the decimal <b>Maltese</b> <b>lira</b> in 1972, and the euro in 2008.|$|E
50|$|In December 1980, the dinar {{was officially}} pegged to the IMF's {{special drawing rights}} (SDRs).
