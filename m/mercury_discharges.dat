The paper treats their contributions to high pressure <b>mercury</b> <b>discharge</b> lamps, especially the water cooled super high pressure <b>mercury</b> <b>discharge</b> lamps with a pressure of a few hundreds of atmosphere. Because of their rather white colour and high efficiency, high pressure mercury lamps were, from 1906 on, a potential rival of the incandescent lamps, especially for street and square lighting. However, severe problems with the ignition of the gas discharge and the lead-in wires prevented the introduction of these lamps at that time. In the early thirties Bol contributed to a great extend to {{the solution of the}} problem of the lead-in wires, after which super high pressure <b>mercury</b> <b>discharge</b> lamps were technically feasible. Elenbaas theoretically derived mathematical relations between technically important variables, such as efficiency, candlepower and luminence, which were instrumental in the invention and development of super high pressure mercury lamps. Some remarks are made on the differences between scientifically and technically oriented theories.

The present study evaluates {{the impact of this}} disturbance and the recovery processes, temporally and spatially, by means of examining the richness of the species of salt marsh plants and mercury concentrations in sediments over the last fifty years. The temporal assessment showed that the mercury loading induced a shift in the species composition of the salt marsh from a non-disturbed salt marsh with higher species richness to an alternative state dominated by Phragmites australis. The horizontal assessment, through a mercury gradient, presents the same trend, indicating that P. australis is the species most tolerant to higher mercury concentrations, comparative to Halimione portulacoides, Arthrocnemum fruticosum, Triglochin maritima, Juncus maritimus and Scirpus maritimus.

Annual Hg emission to air from by-product sources was equal 13. 5 Mg, with the highest share of emission from brown coal-fired power plants. Mercury contained in combustion residues and removed from flue gases is transferred to waste waters, disposed to landfills and used to a concrete production with unknown amounts. Annual mercury emission to air {{from the use of}} mercury-containing products (0. 5 Mg) was estimated by authors based on model for distribution and emissions for batteries, light sources, other electrical and electronic equipment and also for measuring and control equipment.

For such species the solution of transport equations can be avoided. However, the traditional formalism lacks a good measure of the error that is made by this approximation. In order to fill this gap, a relation is established between the CRM method and the Chemical Reduction Technique (CRT) [2, 3]. Both methods have the same goal: {{to reduce the number of}} transport equations without eliminating reaction channels. The reduction technique is based on the diagonalisation of the source jacobian. It allows a more precise assessment of the errors induced by the QSS assumption. By diagonalisation, the problem is rewritten in terms of linear combinations of the pecies densities, whose evolution in time is characterised by decay times that are related to the corresponding eigenvalues. In this contribution, the application to both atomic Ar and Hg plasmas is discussed. The results show agreement with the CRM literature [1]. For common plasma parameters, only the atom and ion ground state densities need to be dealt with explicitly, while the other (excited) states can be assumed to be quasi-steady.

Individuals of the three species were transplanted to three sites that included a clean unpolluted upstream site, a contaminated location next to the mercury source and a downstream one. The study focused on digestive gland antioxidant and oxidative stress responses such as antioxidant enzymes, glutathione S transferase, glutathione levels, metallothionein proteins, DNA strand breaks and lipid peroxidation levels. Results evidenced interspecies differences on accumulation levels of mercury, antioxidant defensive systems and oxidative tissue damage. The naiad species, despite of accumulating more mercury showed the greatest antioxidant defensive potential, which was characterized by having high constitutive activities of glutathione S transferase and inducible activities and levels of key antioxidant enzymes and glutathione. Exposed individuals of C. fluminea had moderate levels of metal accumulation, the highest activities of antioxidant enzymes but also high levels of lipid peroxidation.

40|$|The Y- 12 National Security Complex (Y- 12 Complex) is {{an active}} {{manufacturing}} and developmental engineering facility that {{is located on the}} U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Oak Ridge Reservation. Building 9201 - 2 {{was one of the first}} process buildings constructed at the Y- 12 Complex. Construction involved relocating and straightening of the Upper East Fork Poplar Creek (UEFPC) channel, adding large quantities of fill material to level areas along the creek, and pumping of concrete into sinkholes and solution cavities present within the limestone bedrock. Flow from a large natural spring designated as ''Big Spring'' on the original 1943 Stone & Webster Building 9201 - 2 Field Sketch FS 6003 was captured and directed to UEFPC through a drainpipe designated Outfall 51. The building was used from 1953 to 1955 for pilot plant operations for an industrial process that involved the use of large quantities of elemental mercury. Past operations at the Y- 12 Complex led to the release of mercury to the environment. Significant environmental media at the site were contaminated by accidental releases of mercury from the building process facilities piping and sumps associated with Y- 12 Complex mercury handling facilities. Releases to the soil surrounding the buildings have resulted in significant levels of mercury in these areas of contamination, which is ultimately transported to UEFPC, its streambed, and off-site. Bechtel Jacobs Company LLC (BJC) is the DOE-Oak Ridge Operations prime contractor responsible for conducting environmental restoration activities at the Y- 12 Complex. In order to mitigate the mercury being released to UEFPC, the Big Spring Water Treatment System will be designed and constructed as a Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act action. This facility will treat the combined flow from Big Spring feeding Outfall 51 and the inflow now being processed at the East End Mercury Treatment System (EEMTS).

40|$|This report {{presents}} initial {{results obtained}} during year 2008 and satisfies a deliverable {{listed in the}} work breakdown structure (WBS) element OR 081301. Broad objectives of the multi-year project are: (1) evaluation of remediation technologies for waterborne mercury, (2) development of treatment methods for soil mercury, and (3) source identification, characterization and analyses to improve mass balance on mercury estimates. This report {{presents the results of}} pilot tests, conducted in summer and fall 2008, which focused on remediation of waterborne mercury. The goal of this task is to develop strategies and treatment technologies that reduce the concentration and loading of waterborne <b>mercury</b> <b>discharges</b> to the UEFPC, thus minimizing mercury uptake by fish. The two specific studies are: (1) reducing flow augmentation in UEFPC to lessen mercury mobilization from contaminated stream sediments, and (2) treatment of contaminated source waters with a chemical reductant to convert dissolved mercury to a volatile form that can be removed by air stripping or natural evasion. Diversion of 50 % of the flow currently added to UEFPC by the flow management system appeared to reduce mercury inputs from a localized, highly contaminated streambed by 0. 6 - 1. 5 grams per day (g/d). A reduction of 0. 6 g/d represents {approx} 7 - 10 % decrease in mercury input to UEFPC. Mercury concentrations within UEFPC did not rise proportionately with the loss of dilution, {{in part because of the}} reduction in input from the streambed source and in part because of reduced flow from the Y- 12 NSC storm drain system. A longer-term test that includes seasonal variability will be the next step to validate these initial field observations of the flow diversion experiment. Preliminary laboratory experiments show that a large fraction ({approx} 90 %) of the mercury can be chemically reduced to Hg(0) by addition of low concentrations of tin, Sn(II). Conversion of mercury to volatile Hg(0) in UEFPC was also demonstrated in the field by in-situ addition of low levels of Sn(II) in the headwaters. A substantial fraction ({approx} 30 % of baseline mercury levels by the end of the experiment) of the mercury was converted from oxidation state II to 0. The addition of the dechlorinating agent sodium thiosulfate mobilized a small amount of additional mercury from the pipe through which EFPC flowed, but the excess Hg largely disappeared by the end of the chemical addition period. No excess tin was observed at the regulatory monitoring point, mercury levels in air were low, and no in-stream toxicity was observed. At a Hg(II) reduction efficiency of {approx} 30 %, in-situ reduction coupled with air stripping has the potential to remove large quantities of mercury from the UEFPC flow. Air stripping has not been implemented, but a demonstration is planned for the next phase of field experiments. The initial results from this 2008 study suggest a combination of reducing augmented flow volume and chemical reduction using stannous chloride will produce at least a 35 % reduction in baseflow mercury loading to UEFPC, from approximately 8 g/d to 5 g/d. The goal of research in 2009 and beyond will be to gain further improvements in each of these approaches...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} made of the darkening of sodium and {{potassium}} silicate glasses by a low pressure <b>mercury</b> <b>discharge,</b> using electron spectroscopy, Rutherford backscattering, and transmission electron microscopy. Initial changes in glass exposed to a <b>mercury</b> <b>discharge</b> are twofold: (i) <b>mercury</b> from the <b>discharge</b> penetrates very rapidly into the glass to depths of the order of 1 nm. (ii) Alkali ions migrate more slowly away from the surface in a photoelectric field that is caused mainly by trapping of photoelectrons. However, mercury entering the glass does not replace alkali ions. Rather, the mercury penetrates into voids in the glass network that are sufficiently close to the surface. From this "surface reservoir " mercury migrates lowly deeper into the glass. This migration is slower in mixed than in single alkali glasses. We assume that mer-cury migrates as ions in a photoelectric field, assisted by photoelectrons. Ultimately the mercury ions are reduced by photoelectrons to atoms that agglomerate into droplets of metallic mercury reponsible for glass darkening. A mercury dis-charge provides not only(i) mercury ions and (excited) atoms entering the glass and(ii) photons, creating aphotoelectric field in the glass. The discharge also provides (iii) low energy electrons flooding the glass. The latter greatly enhance the strength of the photoelectric field in the glass by recombination with photoholes in the glass near the surface. As regards the effect on the darkening of the glass composition, not nly the overall composition is considered (e. g., conductivity, molar volume, shear modulus), but also superficial changes in the composition...|$|R
2500|$|Acute {{methylmercury}} poisoning occurred at Grassy Narrows in Ontario, Canada (see Ontario Minamata disease) {{as a result}} of mercury released from the mercury-cell Chloralkali process, which uses liquid mercury as an electrode in a process that entails electrolytic decomposition of brine, followed by mercury methylation in the aquatic environment. An acute {{methylmercury poisoning}} tragedy occurred in Minamata, Japan following release of methylmercury into Minamata Bay and its tributaries (see Minamata disease). [...] In the Ontario case, inorganic <b>mercury</b> <b>discharged</b> into the environment was methylated in the environment; whereas in Minamata, Japan, there was direct industrial discharge of methylmercury.|$|R
30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the adsorption properties of this new material and a commercial ion exchange resin, Lewatit MonoPlus TP- 214 (LANXESS Deutschland GmbH, Leverkusen, Germany). It is known that ion exchangers are capable of purifying the water below the <b>mercury</b> <b>discharge</b> limit [8]. TP- 214 is a monospherical, macroporous chelating resin with thiourea groups and has a high affinity for mercury. It cannot be regenerated. The effect of initial concentration and contact time on the mercury adsorption was investigated. The adsorption equilibrium data and kinetics data were analysed using Langmuir and Freundlich models and pseudo-first/second-order kinetic models, respectively.|$|R
