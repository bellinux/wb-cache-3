I thought about that idea, that the glorious moment of your life is when you decide that it's okay to go, you don’t have any more words to say, more business, more mountains to climb.

500|$|By the {{following}} year, {{the case against}} Andrić was dropped {{due to lack of}} evidence, and he was released from prison on 20 March 1915. The authorities exiled him to the village of Ovčarevo, near Travnik. He arrived there on 22 March and was placed under the supervision of local Franciscan monks. Andrić soon befriended the friar Alojzije Perčinlić and began researching the history of Bosnia's Catholic and Orthodox Christian communities under Ottoman rule. Andrić lived in the parish headquarters, and the Franciscans gave him access to the monastery chronicles. In return, he assisted the parish priest and taught religious songs to pupils at the monastery school. Andrić's mother soon came to see her son, and offered to serve as a housekeeper for the parish priest. [...] "Mother is very happy," [...] Andrić wrote. [...] "It has been three whole years since she saw me. And she can't grasp all that has happened to <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> time, nor the whole of my crazy, cursed existence. She cries, kisses me and laughs in turn. Like a mother." ...|$|E

A museum, called the Bobby Orr Hall of Fame, where his Order of Canada medal is on display along with other exhibits. Also named in his honour is The Bobby Orr Community Centre, a multi-purpose entertainment facility located in his hometown of Parry Sound, Ontario. In 1995, Bobby Orr was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame. Orr has been honoured with a star on Canada's Walk of Fame in Toronto. In 2004 an Elementary School in South Oshawa named after Orr opened. [...] On November 27, 2008, the Oshawa Generals retired Orr's number 2 jersey; the Generals had not issued the number since Orr transferred to the NHL in 1966. Orr thanked all who helped him in the four years he played in Oshawa: [...] "I did a lot of growing up in Oshawa from ages 14 to 18 and I'll be forever grateful for those people who helped <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> time of my life."

500|$|McCormack {{was born}} in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the son of Doris (1932–2006), a homemaker, and Keith McCormack, an oil company {{financial}} analyst who died from cancer in 2008. [...] He is the oldest of three siblings. McCormack has Scottish ancestry. McCormack states while he was growing up, he was shy and did not play sports. McCormack attended Stephen Leacock Collegiate Institute High School in Scarborough, Ontario. There, he enrolled in theatre and performed in high school productions of Godspell and Pippin, and decided {{to pursue a career}} in acting. McCormack recalls after performing in Godspell, his feelings towards becoming an actor solidified. [...] "...I remember after the first performance of that... I knew where to fit in. That was the beginning of my life as an actor. It changed <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> the concept of any other options disappeared. From that moment there was no question. I knew exactly what I was going to do. I'm lucky that way." [...] He admits that he never felt cool growing up. [...] "I was a bit of an outsider, but I discovered theatre very early on, which got me through." [...] He then transferred to Sir John A. Macdonald Collegiate Institute in Scarborough, where he went to school with David Furnish. He graduated in 1982.|$|E

500|$|People {{are always}} {{using the word}} Illuminati but they're always {{referencing}} it in an incorrect way. People often accuse me of {{being a member of}} the Illuminati and I think in today's pop culture the Illuminati is perceived as a group of powerful, successful people who are working behind the scenes to control the universe. Not people with consciousness, not people who are enlightened. So people were accusing me of {{being a member of the}} Illuminati, and I kept going, wait—so first I had to figure out what that meant...I know who the real Illuminati are, and I know where that word comes from. The real Illuminati were a group of scientists, artists, philosophers, writers, who came about in what is referred to as the Age of Enlightenment, after the Dark Ages, when there was no writing and no art and no creativity and no spirituality, and life was really at a standstill. And right after that, everything flourished. So we had people like Shakespeare and Leonardo Da Vinci and Michaelangelo and Isaac Newton, and all these great minds and great thinkers, and they were called Illuminati...It had nothing to do with money and power. Of course they were powerful, because they influenced people. But their goal was to inspire and enlighten. So when people refer to me as a member of the Illuminati, I always want to say thank you. Thank you for putting <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> category.|$|E

2500|$|After {{manufacture}} at Republic's Farmingdale, Long Island, plant, the two XF-84Hs were disassembled {{and shipped}} via rail to Edwards Air Force Base for flight testing. First flown on July 22, 1955, the XF-84F had incredible acceleration but soon its impracticality was discovered. It was unsuited to combat {{due to the}} engine's 30 minute warm up time but the most serious concerns were vibration generated from the 12-foot propeller diameter and mechanical failures of the prop pitch gearing. The prototypes flew a total of 12 test flights from Edwards, accumulating only 6 hours and 40 minutes of flight time. Lin Hendrix, one of the Republic test pilots assigned to the program, flew the aircraft once and refused to ever fly it again, claiming [...] "it never flew over [...] indicated, since at that speed, it developed an unhappy practice of 'snaking', apparently losing longitudinal stability". [...] Hendrix also told the formidable Republic project engineer, [...] "You aren't big enough and there aren't enough of you to get <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> thing again". The other test flights were fraught with engine failures, and persistent hydraulic, nose gear, and vibration problems. Test pilot Hank Beaird took the XF-84H up 11 times, with 10 of these flights ending in forced landings.|$|E
2500|$|Boat 13 was {{partially}} filled from the Boat Deck and partially from A Deck {{after it had}} been lowered to that level when it was launched {{under the supervision of}} Murdoch and Moody at 1:40a.m. Again, it was heavily occupied, with 65 people aboard and Leading Fireman Frederick Barrett in charge. The occupants were mainly Second and Third Class women and children. Among the men aboard was Lawrence Beesley, who subsequently wrote a popular book about the disaster. Dr. Washington Dodge was also aboard, having earlier seen his wife and young son aboard Boat 5. He owed his presence aboard the boat to the apparent guilty feelings of Steward F. Dent Ray, who had urged the Dodges to sail on Titanic in the first place. Just before Boat 5 was lowered, Ray bundled Dodge aboard. 12-year-old Second Class passenger Ruth Becker was placed in this boat by Moody after being prevented from entering the heavily overloaded lifeboat number 11 which her mother and two siblings had boarded. She {{was one of the few}} passengers who brought blankets from her stateroom into a boat, which were later used to keep stokers, who were wearing sleeveless shirts, warm while rowing. Others did not want to board at all. A woman on deck became hysterical, crying, [...] "Don't put <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> boat! I don't want to go in that boat!

2500|$|In the season's {{final game}} at Chicago, Curtis was disqualified {{early in the}} game on grounds of {{unnecessary}} roughness. Early in the game, Chicago quarterback Walter Eckersall, considered {{the best player in the}} West, dropped back for a punt from Chicago's 40-yard line, and Curtis broke through and threw Eckersall to the frozen ground as he tried to block the kick. Eckersall lay on the ground knocked out for two minutes following the blow. The referee ruled that Curtis had swung an upper cut at Eckersall's jaw and ruled Curtis out of the game. [...] A newspaper account of the incident reported that, after Eckersall had gotten the punt safely away, Curtis, who had broken through, [...] "came down on the little maroon like a whirlwind, knocking him down." [...] Without Curtis in the lineup, Michigan lost its first game since 1900, losing to Chicago by a score of 2 to 0. After the game, Yost observed, [...] "Michigan's chances were materially lessened when Curtis went out." [...] The ruling ejecting Curtis from the Chicago game became a source of controversy. Eckersall himself spoke in defense of Curtis:"I will never believe that Curtis intended to rough it with <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> unfortunate incident in the Michigan game. He was doing his best to block the punt, but could not stop in time to keep from running me down. I have known Curtis for several years, and he is a gentleman and one of the best sportsmen I have ever met. I feel that he has been unjustly censured for the play in which I was injured and for which he was ruled out of the game." ...|$|E
