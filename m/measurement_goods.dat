40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{influence}} of magnification and superimposition of structures on CBCT-generated lateral cephalometric radiographs (LCR) using different segments of the cranium. METHODS: CBCT scans of 10 patients were selected. Four LCR were generated using Dolphin Imaging(r) software: full-face, right side, left side and center of the head. A total of 40 images were imported into Radiocef Studio 2 (r), and the angles of the most common cephalometric analyses were traced by the same observer twice and within a 10 -day interval. Statistical analyses included intraexaminer agreement and comparison between methods by means of intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman agreement tests. RESULTS: Intraexaminer agreement of the angles assessed by ICC was excellent (> 0. 90) for 83 % of <b>measurements,</b> <b>good</b> (between 0. 75 and 0. 90) for 15 %, and moderate (between 0. 50 and 0. 75) for 2 % of measurements.

Variables presenting wider confidence intervals (> 6 o) in the Bland-Altman tests, in intraexaminer assessment, were: mandibular incisor angle, maxillary incisor angle, and occlusal plane angle.

CONCLUSION: Superimposition of structures seemed to influence the results more than magnification, and neither one of them significantly influenced the measurements.
