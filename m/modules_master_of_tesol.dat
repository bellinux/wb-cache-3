40|$|Many TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) {{programmes}} {{focus on}} providing professional knowledge to Asian {{teachers who are}} pursuing their degrees in English-speaking countries. However, not much attention is given to their expectations, personal lived experiences and identity construction while studying in these countries. These aspects are important in their development as users and teachers of English. This article explores these aspects through interviews and email correspondence with Thinh, a highly accomplished TESOL professional who pursued a <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>TESOL</b> degree as an international student in Australia. Findings suggest {{that when she was}} in Australia, she displayed strong agency as she changed some aspects of her identity in order to adapt to studying and living in the country. Nevertheless, there is also continuity in her identity construction, as she maintained other aspects of the identity that she brought from her home country. Her identity construction is best seen in the context of her investment in her career in her home country. As a resilient individual, Thinh demonstrates how she manages her process of identity construction through her reflections and strategic thinking. The findings of this study suggest the need for TESOL programmes to actively connect international students' lived experiences outside class to their pursuit of professional knowledge...|$|R
40|$|In {{this era}} of globalisation, many bilingual {{teachers}} of English are pursuing their postgraduate degrees in English-speaking contexts. However, most teacher training programmes concentrate on providing academic qualifications to these in-service teachers of English, while neglecting their expectations and lived experiences outside class. The current study examines this gap by interviewing and emailing Asian in-service teachers of English who were enrolled in a <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>TESOL</b> programme in Australia. It explores how these in-service teachers' expectations to improve their spoken English influenced their experiences outside class. This study seeks to understand how these in-service teachers developed as users and teachers of English. Findings suggest that when the participants were in Australia, they actively connected their expectations and their pursuit of content knowledge inside class with their experiences outside class. They also exercised agency {{in order to achieve}} their expectations of increasing their English proficiency. Moreover, the participants demonstrated how they developed as users and teachers of English through their strategic thinking and actions.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the theoretical considerations of pedagogy, educational and instructional design {{in building a}} language education program, through flexible mode content delivery and online teaching. The concept of training teachers online is still controversial and this paper addresses some of the concerns raised in the professional literature. The aim of the paper is to present a theoretical framework developed for an online <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> Arts in <b>TESOL</b> program at Bond University, Gold Coast, Australia. The framework adopted for the project incorporates a range of approaches to learning and teaching, and it addresses the ongoing debate of the place of teacher-centred approaches within education. The research methodology adopted {{for the design of}} the project is the iterative version of the ADDIE, a model of instructional design. The paper uses quantitative and qualitative data to support the theoretical underpinnings, and it presents examples of flexible learning resources, designed and developed for the <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> Arts in <b>TESOL</b> program. The theoretical approach and the teaching practices proposed in this project contribute an effective research-based framework for teaching in a virtual environment...|$|R
40|$|Insights from {{critical}} pedagogy inform TESOL {{educators in}} Vietnam that pedagogical interventions should be particular to their context and environment. This paper presents a qualitative descriptive analysis of four {{teachers who are}} students in a <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> Education (<b>TESOL)</b> program delivered in Vietnam by Victoria University (Melbourne) via a partnership with Hanoi University. The study draws on the assessed work {{of students in the}} unit ‘Innovation’ which aims to encourage its students, all of whom are professional educators, to identify a research problem specific to their teaching and learning environment and design a research question built around a pedagogical or curricular intervention they can ethically implement and evaluate within their workplaces. This activity, serving as both curriculum and assessment, empowers students to apply a segment of an action research cycle to their classrooms. The study presents four narratives of teacher/researchers engaged in innovation research, identifying research problems, developing topics and lines of enquiry and ultimately evaluating their projects reflectively. This pedagogical approach articulates the idea that the best people to know what innovations are required in Vietnamese educational contexts are the teachers themselves...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} {{a critique of}} institutional discourses that are informed by race, culture and identity, learning constraints and particular constructions of English and offers ways of thinking that encourage multiplicity and complexity. Its principal aim is to probe issues relating to the identity formation <b>of</b> international <b>TESOL</b> students {{in the context of}} the globalisation of international education. To achieve this aim, the study poses questions about the commodification <b>of</b> the <b>TESOL</b> machinery through marketing programmes and its impact on international TESOL students. In addressing these questions the study considers Australian universities’ marketing practices, the discursive representation of international students by these universities and the government, as well as wider matters of educational policy. The research draws on poststructuralist and postcolonial theories, particularly on selected aspects of the works of Foucault and Said and in so doing demonstrates the usefulness of such theories for exploring issues associated with international TESOL students. Taking from these theorists the concepts of power/knowledge, subjectivity, identity and agency, it also incorporates the work of cultural theorists such as Althusser and Hall. The participants were drawn from a wide range of cultural, linguistic and professional backgrounds, enrolled in <b>Masters</b> <b>of</b> <b>TESOL</b> at Australian universities. Through dialogic sessions with them and documentary analysis the discursive practices of the university sites were examined. So too were the subjectivities of students, as they became involved in the various activities of the institution in which they were enrolled, before, during and after their studies. Overall, the analysis reveals how the subjectivities <b>of</b> international <b>TESOL</b> students are constructed both by the university and the students themselves. The students’ accounts of their experiences broadly conflicted with the sweeping claims made by certain institutes, as well as by the dominant knowledges of marketing, international education and globalisation. The analysis shows how the subjectivities <b>of</b> international <b>TESOL</b> students are constructed by both the university and by the students themselves. It also shows how economics has become firmly entrenched in a market discourse and overall how international students are inscribed within policy shifts. The academic welfare, teaching and learning processes of the university indicated little awareness of the fluidity of culture and language or hybridity of its international students. A consequence of this myopic vision of the university is that students are subjected to constricting, divisive and exclusionary discursive practices that fail to properly acknowledge their complex histories, subjectivities and professional aspirations. An identity has been created for them that is not only superficial but also inaccurate. The findings point to the benefits of examining through a Foucauldian analytic such discursive practices of the institution alongside the subjectivities of students. The approach adopted in the research points to the possibility of moving beyond the current reductionist dualisms and binaries to the adoption of educational and institutional practices that recognise students’ hybridity and syncretic subjectivity. In such a space, the meaning of ‘international students’ and the institutional and educational policies and practices designed for them might be renegotiated. The study concludes that if the goal of genuine internationalisation is to be achieved, there is a need for significant institutional change...|$|R

40|$|THE PROFESSIONAL LIFE-CYCLES AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF ADULT TEACHERS OF ENGLISH TO SPEAKERS <b>OF</b> OTHER LANGUAGES (<b>TESOL)</b> This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{findings}} of a research study conducted in Geneva and Sydney to examine the career cycles <b>of</b> <b>TESOLs.</b> It explores many of the issues investigated in Hubermans study of 160 secondary school teachers in Geneva (1989, 1993). Seventy-three in-depth interviews were conducted with teachers and trainers / administrators in adult TESOL, and professional development issues were examined in greater detail than in the Huberman study. The central {{purpose of the study was}} to test the universality of the Huberman model <b>of</b> career phases. <b>TESOLs</b> were found to have far more variations during their career cycles than school teachers, who were in a more stable and predictable situation. The study focused on particular moments in the career cycle, exploring TESOLs levels <b>of</b> satisfaction. <b>TESOLs</b> in the present study were found to have similar intrinsic satisfactions and concerns about working conditions as the findings <b>of</b> other <b>TESOL</b> studies. Although the occupation was reportedly becoming increasingly more professional, its unpredictable nature made it stimulating and rewarding. In spite of the instability <b>of</b> the <b>TESOL</b> career, TESOLs appeared to have more positive career experiences overall than many school teachers with more stable career paths. The study also examined professional development issues by comparing the perceptions <b>of</b> <b>TESOLs</b> and their trainers / administrators. They had many divergent opinions as to the professional development requirements <b>of</b> <b>TESOLs.</b> While there was no conclusive evidence that professional development could be linked to stages, TESOLs in a phase of diversification were found to have different professional development requirements from other phases. Personal, professional and environmental factors also affect the professional development requirements <b>of</b> <b>TESOLs</b> at any stage. In summary, it appears that the traditional career phase model is inappropriate when applied to TESOLs, and perhaps for other similarly unstable careers. With the recent changes in peoples professional lives, requiring increasing mobility and adaptability in the changing job market, other career path models to guide counselling, professional development and other staff management programs will need to be explored...|$|R
