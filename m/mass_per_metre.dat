40|$|The {{level of}} wire rope {{technology}} used in mine hoisting applications {{has a significant}} effect on the overall efficiency of the hoisting system. This paper discusses the effect that a reduction in rope mass per unit length and an increase in rope breaking strength can have on rock skip capacity and hence mine shaft output. A 20 per cent reduction in rope <b>mass</b> <b>per</b> <b>metre</b> for a typical 48 mm hoisting rope, while maintaining the breaking strength, increases the skip’s capacity by circa 30 per cent at a suspended rope length of 3000 m. Such gains in shaft output, without any significant changes to the shaft or winder design, can have major implications for the feasibility of future deep mine projects. The technical challenge for rope manufacturers is how to get rid of 20 to 30 per cent of the rope mass while keeping the breaking strength and modulus of elasticity of the whole rope constant. CASAR are currently developing steel wire rope constructions where the steel IWRC has been replaced with high strength...|$|E
40|$|The data {{consists}} of, standing aboveground biomass, and belowground biomass measurements, from {{sites in}} the Conwy catchment. Standing aboveground biomass was measured at 7 sites and belowground biomass measurements were made at 8 sites. Data were collected in 2013 and 2014. The sites were chosen to represent habitat types and the terrestrial productivity gradient in Britain from intensive agriculturally managed lowland grasslands through to montane heath. Standing aboveground biomass (grams of dry <b>mass</b> <b>per</b> <b>metre</b> square) in habitats dominated by herbaceous biomass was measured on 1 x 1 metre quadrats in four plots per site. Standing aboveground biomass in woodlands was measured in two 200 square metre areas by means of stem cores and litter collections. Belowground total root biomass (grams of dry mass per square metre) was assessed for the topsoil 0 - 15 centimetres in three plots per site. Measurements were undertaken by trained members of staff from Bangor University and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. This data was collected for the NERC project ‘The Multi-Scale Response of Water quality, Biodiversity and Carbon Sequestration to Coupled Macronutrient Cycling from Source to Sea’ (NE/J 011991 / 1).

40|$|The {{effect of}} five row {{spacings}} (RS) on source/sink processes in a plant crop of NCo 376 was investigated at Mount Edgecombe. Tiller population (TPOP), fractional light interception (FI), intercepted radiation (RADI), cane and sucrose yields were recorded over {{the duration of}} growth. The crop was fully drip irrigated {{in order to avoid}} water stress conditions. Differences in FIPAR between the treatments were most pronounced early in the growing season. It took 140, 188 and 215 days after emergence (DAE) to reach 0. 8 FIPAR at 0. 73 m, 1. 69 m and 2. 66 m RS, respectively. The rate of canopy closure had a direct linear relationship with RS and increased by 26 %m- 1 reduction in RS. The total accumulated incident global radiation from day of planting until final harvest was 5772 MJm- 2, giving a seasonal fraction of radiation intercepted of 0. 49, 0. 37 and 0. 26 for 0. 73 m, 1. 69 m and 2. 66 m RS respectively. The rate of increase in TPOP was directly related to the amount of seed cane planted, and the timing of peak TPOP (or onset of tiller senescence) did not relate to FI for the different RS treatments. These results confirm previous observations that the light environment within the stool zone, rather than in the inter-row zone, dictates tiller phenology prior to peak TPOP. Final TPOP demonstrated a linear increase of 4. 29 tillers m- 2 with decrease in RS (R 2 = 0. 86). Radiation use efficiency (RUE) ranged from 1. 25, 1. 35 and 1. 72 gMJ- 1 for 0. 73, 1. 69 and 2. 66 m RS respectively. In addition to achieving higher RUE, wider rows partitioned a higher fraction of aerial dry mass to stalks. At 12 months there was an average response of 13 % increase in stalk dry <b>mass</b> <b>per</b> <b>metre</b> decrease in RS. This relates well to previous South African studies...|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{lines of}} astrophysical {{evidence}} suggest that over {{one-quarter of the}} mass of the Universe takes the form of dark matter, with a density in our Solar System of roughly one hydrogen atom's <b>mass</b> <b>per</b> cubic <b>metre.</b> Most attempts to directly detect dark matter have focused on particles such as weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) or axions. Enormous detectors searching for dark matter have been built. They are looking for signals such as tiny flashes of light from collisions between dark matter and liquid xenon, phonons created by collisions in germanium, or microwaves generated by axions in a resonant cavity. Yet so far, dark matter has passed through the Earth undetected. An alternative explanation is that dark matter acts more like a classical, spatially dependent field. Writing in Nature Physics, Andrei Derevianko and Maxim Pospelov now suggest searching for such a field using a world-wide network of atomic clocks to register any changes in the their ticking rate as the Earth passes through dark matter...|$|R

40|$|Steel {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{construction}} materials which play an important role in the construction industry in Sri Lanka. The supply of durable construction materials is always identified as one of the major obstacles to improved construction in developing countries whether in the cities or in the rural areas. The reinforcement of concrete with steel rods is more safe, efficient and more economical. It has excellent bonding properties as well as high yield/proof stress and elongation. Most of the sales outlets do not provide information on the grade of steel. Hence laboratory testing to verify the steel grade is more essential before its use in construction purposes. Requirements for ribbed steel bars for the reinforcement of concrete are specified in SLS 375. It specifies two grades of steel bars: RB 460 and RB 500. Corresponding British Standard : BS 4449 issued in 2005 provides for three grades of steel, all of which should have a characteristic yield strength of 500 N/mm 2 (MPa) but differing in respect of other properties such as tensile / yield strength ratio and total elongation at maximum force. The requirements specified in SLS 375 cover, material requirements (chemical properties), dimensions and <b>mass</b> <b>per</b> <b>metre,</b> surface geometry, and mechanical properties (Tensile / Yield strength ratio) total elongation at maximum force. One of the main difficulties faced in quality assurance of the concreting steel bars (mainly 25 mm and above) in Sri Lanka is the lack of facilities to determine the tensile strength, yield strength and elongation, which are the key parameters determining the quality of the material. Lack of standardized equipment having sufficient capacity to perform tensile tests often leads to incorrect quality assessments of the steel products. To develop a mathematical relationship between results of tensile test and three-point bend test for all available bar sizes of cold twisted bars and thermally treated steel bars are being measured and obtained the relations with 0. 2 % proof stress in tensile testing with 0. 04 % offset yield stress in three point bend testing for each bar diameters...|$|E

40|$|The data {{consists}} of plant structural plant community measurements from 15 sites {{located in the}} Conwy catchment (North Wales) and from 2 sites in North West England. Annual aboveground net primary productivity (NPP), canopy height (cht), bryophyte cover (Bcov), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf mass area (LMA) and specific leaf area (SLA) were measured on the dominant plant species. Data were collected in 2013 and 2014. The sites were chosen to represent habitat types and the terrestrial productivity gradient in Britain from intensive agriculturally managed lowland grasslands through to montane heath. Plots within the sites were located using a stratified random sampling design. Plant trait values were taken from existing published databases or were directly measured in each plot for the two species contributing the highest percentage cover. NPP (grams of dry <b>mass</b> <b>per</b> square <b>metre</b> <b>per</b> year) was measured {{using a variety of}} methods according to the plant functional types present. SLA and LDMC was measured on site focussing on the dominant vascular plant species in each plot defined as the two species contributing maximum standing biomass in the year of sampling. Leaf area was calculated based on scanned photographs analysed using Image J software v 1. 46 r. Plant parameters were tested across a land use intensification gradient to detect parameters that can predict aboveground biomass production across different land management types. Data were used to enhance the predictions of biomass production in the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator model (JULES). Measurements informed the improvement of the nitrogen cycle component in the model.
