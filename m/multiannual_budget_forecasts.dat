40|$|The article {{discloses}} {{the essence}} of <b>budget</b> <b>forecasting</b> and defines its role in ensuring the State regulation of economic processes. It has been substantiated that <b>budget</b> <b>forecasting,</b> on the one hand, {{is the basis for}} the preparation of a forecast of the socio-economic development of the administrative-territorial units and the country as a whole, also for the timely and substantiated composition of projects of the State and local budgets for the planned budget period and for the medium term for the adoption of economic, social and political decisions in the process of implementing the relevant budgets. On the other hand, <b>budget</b> <b>forecasting</b> is based on the forecast of socio-economic indicators of the country’s development. The main objective of the <b>budget</b> <b>forecast</b> is to determine the scientific assumptions that include: substantiation of the sources and directions of use of the budgetary means; scientific analysis of the economically based income in the relevant budget; provision for future development of income and the directions of utilization of budgetary means; assessment of the possible impact of decisions made in the budget sphere...|$|R

The perspectives of Romania’s EU accession enforced this process and the NBR accounted performances in targeting its objectives. In this study we underline the challenges and consequences of Romanian central bank reform. In spite of a central bank independence, sometimes between monetary and fiscal polices there are no correlation. That’s why we propose the <b>multiannual</b> <b>budgeting</b> as a correspondent in fiscal policy for inflation targeting monetary policy framework. Also we assess the consequences of Basel II implementation for Romanian banking system and, especially NBR responsibilities...|$|R

40|$|Although seen as {{a sector}} {{with a high degree}} of inertia and {{conservatism}} the public administration system determines the public institutions to record a set of influences both from the internal and external environment. The public administration system is influenced by the frequent legislative changes and recently by the requirements claimed by the European Union. Given the complexity and dynamics of the competitive environment the approach of strategic management tools at the level of public administration becomes more and more important and necessary. One of the main types of exercise of strategic management is represented by financial planning moulded into policies, strategies, plans and programmes whose generation is based on <b>multiannual</b> <b>budgets...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{test the}} extent to which {{political}} manoeuvrings can be the sources of measurement errors in forecasts. Our objective is to examine the forecast error based on a simple model in which we attempt to explain deviations between the March <b>budget</b> <b>forecast</b> and the November forecast, and deviations between the outcome and the March <b>budget</b> <b>forecast</b> in the UK. The analysis is based on forecasts made by the general government. We use the forecasts of the variables as alternatives to the outcomes. We also test for political spins in the GDP forecast updates and the GDP forecast errors. We find evidence of partisan and electoral effects in forecast updates and forecast errors.

40|$|Several {{recent efforts}} to improve <b>budget</b> <b>forecasting</b> {{techniques}} have emphasized the uncertainties inherent in projections of economic behavior and demography. Previous attempts to present stochastic budget projections for the U. S. have successfully incorporated sources of long-run uncertainty but have not attempted to model business cycle fluctuations realistically. While perhaps reasonably accurate in the long run, stochastic models that ignore cyclical uncertainty offer relatively few insights into the short-run uncertainties that may be of greater concern to policymakers. This paper develops a new and parsimonious framework for incorporating both cyclical and long-run uncertainty into a single, consistent set of stochastic budget projections, and it presents new long-term <b>budget</b> <b>forecasts</b> for the U. S. federal government and combined {{state and local governments}} that highlight the role of short-term uncertainty...|$|R
