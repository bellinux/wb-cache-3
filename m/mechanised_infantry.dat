It was originally formed in 1948 as a three battalion regiment; however, since then its size has fluctuated as battalions have been raised, amalgamated or disbanded {{in accordance with the}} Australian government's strategic requirements. Currently, the regiment consists of seven battalions and has fulfilled various roles including those of light, parachute, motorised and <b>mechanised</b> <b>infantry.</b> Throughout its existence, units of the Royal Australian Regiment have deployed on operations in Japan, Korea, Malaya, Borneo, Vietnam, Somalia, Rwanda, Cambodia, East Timor, the Solomon Islands, Iraq and Afghanistan.|$|E

In 1989 four armies appeared to exist: the First Army at Bucharest, Second Army at Buzau, Third Army at Craiova, and Fourth Army at Napoca.

5|$|On 13 July 2002, the {{regiment}} {{was presented with}} its current Standard by the then Governor General, Dr. Peter Hollingworth. On 26 July 2007, after 31 years of service the Leopard was replaced by 59 M1A1 Abrams AIM, with 41 being delivered to {{the regiment}} and the remaining vehicles issued to the School of Armour for use for training purposes. Seven M88A2 Hercules Armoured Recovery Vehicles were also acquired, two being delivered to the regiment. The Leopards never saw operational service, although during the 1999 East Timor crisis the regiment was placed on standby to deploy in the event the conflict escalated, while the regiment was not deployed during Australia's involvement in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Members of the unit later deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan as Bushmaster PMV crews, while others have also served in East Timor and the Solomon Islands. During this period the regiment was the only main battle tank unit in the Australian Army and was based at Robertson Barracks, in Darwin. Until 2013 it {{provided the basis for}} one of three battlegroups within the mechanised 1st Brigade, which included two <b>mechanised</b> <b>infantry</b> battalions, one cavalry regiment, one tank regiment, and a medium artillery regiment.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} and revolves around a fictional conflict between the powers of NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The player has the choice of choosing to control either NATO or Warsaw Pact forces {{at the beginning of}} the game. The player will begin the game on either side of Europe depending on which side was chosen; if NATO was picked, the player will start at western European countries (France, West Germany, Denmark) whereas if the player sides with the Warsaw Pact, the game will begin in eastern Europe. The map is hexagon-shaped and allows the player to move their units in six directions. Each side has a variety of units; infantry move at a slower pace than <b>mechanised</b> <b>infantry</b> however armoured units are able to withstand more damage than regular units. The game displays two maps on screen; the larger, central map displays the current situation whereas a smaller map to the corner of the screen displays a mini-map of Europe, which runs north from Denmark to southern France.|$|E

5000|$|... ===Maneuvering operations=== Maneouvering consumes {{much of an}} {{infantry}} unit's time. Infantry, {{like all}} combat arms units, are often maneuvered to meet battlefield needs, and often must do so under enemy attack. The infantry must maintain their cohesion and readiness during the move to ensure their usefulness when they reach their objective. Traditionally, infantry have relied on their own legs for mobility, but <b>mechanised</b> or armoured <b>infantry</b> often uses trucks and armored vehicles for transport. These units can quickly disembark and transition to light infantry, without vehicles, to access terrain which armoured vehicles can't effectively access.|$|R
