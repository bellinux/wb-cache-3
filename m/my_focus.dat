25|$|The {{sense of}} {{something}} being missing on Aliens was greater {{for me than}} on The Abyss, where the film just got consistently better as the cut got along. The film must function as a dramatic, organic whole. When I cut the film together, things that read well on paper, on a conceptual level, didn't necessarily translate to the screen as well. I felt I was losing something by breaking <b>my</b> <b>focus.</b> Breaking the story's focus and coming off the main characters was a far greater detriment to the film than what was gained. The film keeps the same message intact at a thematic level, not at a really overt level, by working in a symbolic way.|$|E

[...] Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall, which he felt cost him a possible victory: [...] "I am very sad about what happened. It was my fault, I was in a perfect position but then I lost <b>my</b> <b>focus</b> for two seconds, because I began thinking on how to sprint. I touched the wheel of the guy in front of me. That was enough to throw away all the hard work of the team." [...] Nacer Bouhanni in turn was furious after the finish.

After {{converting}} to Christianity, he began to insist that storylines be edited to remove anything he thought too adult or inappropriate in Growing Pains. After the series was cancelled, Cameron did not maintain contact with his former co-stars, and did not speak to Tracey Gold for eight years. Cameron has stated that this was not due to any animosity on his part toward any of his former cast-members, but an outgrowth of his desire {{to start a new life}} away from the entertainment industry, and the life he had been in for the previous seven years. Prior to the premiere of The Growing Pains Movie in 2000, for which the entire main cast reunited, Cameron described his regrets over how his relationship with his castmates changed after his religious conversion during production of the series, saying, [...] "I definitely kind of made an about-face, going toward another aspect of my life", admits Cameron. [...] "I shifted <b>my</b> <b>focus</b> from 100% on the show, to 100% on , and left 0% on the show—and even the friendships that were a part of that show.
