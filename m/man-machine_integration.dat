40|$|Water {{resources}} {{planning and management}} has a considerable history {{in the use of}} computers. By covering a problem domain that combines a solid foundation in the physical sciences, and a large amount of data, with strong elements of socio-economic and political considerations, water {{resources planning}} and management is also an ideal application area for the latest advanced information technology. Advanced information technology provides the tools to design and implement smart software where, in a broad sense, the emphasis is on the <b>man-machine</b> interface. <b>Integration,</b> interaction and visualization are three key concepts that are discussed in detail, using a number of operational software examples. Integration implies that in any given software system for real-world applications, more than one problem representation form or model, several sources of information or data bases, and a multi-faceted, problem-oriented user interface ought to be combined in a common framework to provide a useful and realistic information base. Integration also means that tools such as expert systems components can be embedded in, for example, simulation models and user interfaces in general, providing the means for smart systems behavior. The increasing complexity of such composite tools, in turn, requires a well-structured and modular approach, supported by technological developments such as powerful workstations supporting bit-mapped color graphics and cost-effective high-volume mass storage, distributed computing and networking support, or object-oriented software. Interaction is a central feature of any effective man-machine system: a realtime dialogue allows the user to define and explore a problem incrementally in response to immediate answers from the system; fast and powerful systems with modern processor technology can offer the possibility to simulate dynamic processes with animated output, and they can provide a high degree of responsiveness that is essential to maintaining a successful dialogue and direct control over the software. Obviously, raw computer power, but also the availability of appropriate input and output devices such as high-resolution color screens or mouse pointers, are key requirements here. Visualization provides the band-width necessary to understand large amounts of highly structured information, and permits the development of an intuitive understanding of processes and interdependencies, of spatial and temporal patterns, and complex systems in general. Many of the problem components in a real-world planning or management situation are rather abstract: representing them in a symbolic, graphical format that allows visual inspection of systems behavior and, in general, symbolic interaction with the machine and its software, is an important element in friendly and easy- to-use computer-based systems. Several examples of smart software systems are introduced below, ranging from surface to groundwater flow and transport models, and finally rule- based or expert systems for water resources applications. Some basic principles and building blocks of smart software are discussed with these examples...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} {{designing}} crew stations for large-scale, complex automated systems is made {{difficult because of}} the flexibility of roles that the crew can assume, and by the rapid rate at which system designs become fixed. Modern cockpit automation frequently involves multiple layers of control and display technology in which human operators must exercise equipment in augmented, supervisory, and fully automated control modes. In this context, we maintain that effective human-centered design is dependent on adequate models of human/system performance in which representations of the equipment, the human operator(s), and the mission tasks are available to designers for manipulation and modification.

40|$|To {{meet the}} {{expected}} increases in air traffic demands, NASA and FAA are researching and developing Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) concepts. NextGen will require substantial {{increases in the}} data available to pilots on the flight deck (e. g., weather,wake, traffic trajectory predictions, etc.) to support more precise and closely coordinated operations (e. g., self-separation, RNAV/RNP, and closely spaced parallel operations, CSPOs). These NextGen procedures and operations, along with the pilot's roles and responsibilities, must be designed with consideration of the pilot's capabilities and limitations. Failure to do so will leave the pilots, and thus the entire aviation system, vulnerable to error. A validated <b>Man-machine</b> <b>Integration</b> and design Analysis System (MIDAS) v 5 model was extended to evaluate anticipated changes to flight deck and controller roles and responsibilities in NextGen approach and Land operations.

40|$|The <b>Man-machine</b> <b>Integration</b> Design and Analysis (MIDAS) human {{performance}} model was augmented to improve predictions of multi-operator situation awareness (SA). In MIDAS, {{the environment is}} defined by situation elements (SE) that are processed by the modeled operator via a series of sub-models including visual attention, perception, and memory. Collectively, these sub-models represent the situation assessment process and determine which SEs are attended to and comprehended by the modeled operator. SA is computed as a ratio of the Actual SA (the number of SEs that are detected or comprehended) relative to the Optimal SA (those deemed required or desired for the operator to complete his/her task). A high-fidelity application model of a two-pilot commercial crew during the approach phase of flight was generated to demonstrate and verify the SA model. Two flight deck display configurations, hypothesized to support pilot SA at differing levels, were modeled. The results presented include the ratio of actual to optimal SA for three high-level tasks: Aviate, Separate, and Navigate. The model results verified that the SA model operates as expected and is sensitive to scenario characteristics including display configuration and pilot responsibilities. ...|$|E
40|$|Modeling and {{simulation}} (M&S) {{plays an}} important role when complex human-system notions are being proposed, developed and tested within the system design process. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as an agency uses many different types of M&S approaches for predicting human-system interactions, especially when it is early in the development phase of a conceptual design. NASA Ames Research Center possesses a number of M&S capabilities ranging from airflow, flight path models, aircraft models, scheduling models, human performance models (HPMs), and bioinformatics models among a host of other kinds of M&S capabilities that are used for predicting whether the proposed designs will benefit the specific mission criteria. The <b>Man-Machine</b> <b>Integration</b> Design and Analysis System (MIDAS) is a NASA ARC HPM software tool that integrates many models of human behavior with environment models, equipment models, and procedural / task models. The challenge to model comprehensibility is heightened as the number of models that are integrated and the requisite fidelity of the procedural sets are increased.

40|$|Although use of {{the term}} {{situational}} awareness (SA) assists researchers in creating more fruitful environments for pilots to operate in, its true potential as a psychological construct remains untapped until a valid means of a priori predicting SA becomes available. Shively, Brickner and Silbiger (1997) proposed a computational model of SA (CSA) that seeks to do just that, and the current line of research is a series of studies aimed at validating that model. Originally developed for the <b>Man-machine</b> <b>Integration</b> Design and Analysis System (MIDAS), the CSA model is comprised of two features: situational elements and situation-sensitive higher-order nodes. Situational elements comprise what is known/perceived about the environment (e. g. tank 1 or waypoint 3). Each is associated with a particular higher-order node, and as a group define the situation. Higher-order nodes are semantically related groups of SE's (e. g. threats or navigation) that are weighted based on their importance in the situation. One original aspect of the CSA model is the differentiation between perceived, actual and error SA, a proportion of which produces the operator's predicted SA. Initial validation studies using low-fidelity tasks supported the predictions of the model. Preliminary data analysis of a mid-fidelity, full-mission task completed in the Rotorcraft Part-Task Laboratory (RPTL) at NASA Ames also indicates support for predictions of the model...|$|E

One formalized approach to study the impact of assistive technologies on the human operator in a safe and non-obtrusive manner is {{through the use of}} human performance models (HPMs). HPMs play an integral role when complex human-system designs are proposed, developed, and tested.

40|$|Up to this point, {{research}} into Air Traffic Controller workload has primarily {{focused on a}} number of discrete areas. However, it is widely recognized that different components from these respective fields all contribute to the workload an Air Traffic Controller experiences. Hence, this study has tried to bridge this gap by quantitatively comparing two previously developed models of Air Traffic Controller workload. For the comparison, the contextual Dynamic Density (DD) and the cognitive <b>Man-machine</b> <b>Integration</b> Design and Analysis System (MIDAS) have been chosen. This is due to the well-established nature of these models in their respective fields. In the comparison context of three Conflict Detection & Resolution scenarios, two consistent quantitative relations have been found between a number of DD and MIDAS variables respectively. The most consistent relation effectively illustrated the quantitative relation between the inter-aircraft distance based DD complexity and the MIDAS cognitive/average channel load. Given this relation, a much more thorough understanding has been obtained of how the workload quantification types proposed by both models relate to one-another. It was concluded that none of the models could effectively model the expected workload behavior in solitude. Therefore, it was proposed that knowledge from these models should be combined. Three of such model integration proposals have been given. The proposal in which the MIDAS channel loads were convoluted with the locally applicable DD complexity values appeared to illustrate the physically desired workload behavior.

40|$|Compared to today’s missions, NASA's next {{generation}} of exploration mission will require new cockpit user interfaces and display formats that enable astronauts to operate their vehicles with less real-time assistance from the ground. To achieve a more autonomous concept of vehicle operations, the interfaces will have to ensure an optimal level of crewvehicle interactions and minimize the possibility of crew error. This level of optimization is not guaranteed by the traditional approach to cockpit user interface display design and evaluation, which relies on building crewstation mockups and monitoring crew performance in high-fidelity simulations of crew-vehicle operations. This approach is too expensive and resource-intensive to permit more than {{a small number of}} design options to be evaluated. In this paper, we describe an ongoing program to develop a more automated evaluation approach via the integration of the Apex reactive planning system from the Artificial Intelligence community and a human performance modeling tool, the <b>Man-Machine</b> <b>Integration</b> Design and Analysis (MIDAS) simulation engine from the Human Factors community. MIDAS provides a comprehensive toolset for describing crewstation designs running simulated missions to determine an astronaut’s expected performance using it.
