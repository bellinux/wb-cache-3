5|$|Geochemical {{observations}} <b>may</b> <b>help</b> {{to deduce}} {{the global level}} of biological activity, or the affinity of certain fossils. For example, geochemical features of rocks may reveal when life first arose on Earth, and may provide evidence {{of the presence of}} eukaryotic cells, the type from which all multicellular organisms are built. Analyses of carbon isotope ratios <b>may</b> <b>help</b> to explain major transitions such as the Permian–Triassic extinction event.|$|E

5|$|A further type of (mostly strong red and yellow) {{emergence}} {{has recently}} been discovered in a few Australian species (D. hartmeyerorum, D. indica). Their function is not known yet, although they <b>may</b> <b>help</b> in attracting prey.|$|E
5|$|A further use of CT {{is in the}} {{identification}} of underlying lung lesions. In presumed primary pneumothorax, it <b>may</b> <b>help</b> to identify blebs or cystic lesions (in anticipation of treatment, see below), and in secondary pneumothorax it can help to identify most of the causes listed above.|$|E
5|$|Both the mycelia and {{the fruit}} bodies of M.haematopus (both young and mature specimens) are {{reported}} to be bioluminescent. However, the luminescence is quite weak, and not visible to the dark-adapted eye; in one study, light emission was detectable only after 20hours of exposure to X-ray film. Although the biochemical basis of bioluminescence in M.haematopus has not been scientifically investigated, in general, bioluminescence {{is caused by the}} action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). The biological purpose of bioluminescence in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: it <b>may</b> <b>help</b> attract insects to help with spore dispersal, it may be a by-product of other biochemical functions, or it <b>may</b> <b>help</b> deter heterotrophs that might consume the fungus.|$|E

5|$|Many {{tropical}} butterflies have seasonal {{forms for}} dry and wet seasons. These are switched by the hormone ecdysone. The dry-season forms are usually more cryptic, perhaps offering better camouflage when vegetation is scarce. Dark colours in wet-season forms <b>may</b> <b>help</b> to absorb solar radiation.|$|E
