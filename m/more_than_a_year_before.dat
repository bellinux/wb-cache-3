5|$|A new women's {{suffrage}} {{bill was}} introduced, which the Senate of Argentina sanctioned on 21 August 1946. It {{was necessary to}} wait <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> the House of Representatives sanctioned it on 9 September 1947. Law 13,010 established the equality of political rights {{between men and women}} and universal suffrage in Argentina. Finally, Law 13,010 was approved unanimously. In a public celebration and ceremony, however, Juan Perón signed the law granting women the right to vote, and then he handed the bill to Eva, symbolically making it hers.|$|E
5|$|Activated in 1949, the {{regiment}} trained for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> {{the outbreak of}} the war on June 25, 1950. On that day, half of {{the regiment}} led North Korean forces against South Korean troops by land and sea, pushing them back after several days of fighting. Over the next six weeks the regiment advanced slowly down the Korean Peninsula, acting as a forward unit of the North Korean army. Suffering from a lack of supplies and mounting casualties, the regiment was committed to the Battle of Pusan Perimeter as part of a push to force United Nations (UN) troops out of Korea.|$|E
5|$|Although now 67 {{years old}} and in {{indifferent}} health, Bottomley tried to resurrect his business career. He raised sufficient capital {{to start a new}} magazine, John Blunt, as a rival to John Bull, but the new venture lasted little <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> closing, having lost money from the start. In September 1929 he began an overseas lecture tour, which failed utterly, as did an attempt at a British tour during which he was received with indifference or hostility. By 1930 he was again bankrupt; his wife Eliza died that year, after which Bottomley's former son-in-law Jefferson Cohn evicted him from The Dicker. For the remaining years of his life he lived with his long-time mistress, the actress Peggy Primrose, whom Bottomley, in his years of riches, had vainly tried to promote to stardom.|$|E

5|$|Briarcliff Manor's fire company {{existed for}} <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> Briarcliff Manor's incorporation. Frederick C. Messinger (a fireman in Kingston for ten years) and {{thirteen}} local men founded the private fire company in 1901. Thirty-six men became the company's charter members on March 4, 1902, and dues were set at 25cents per month. On April 15 of that year, the company took the name Briarcliff Steamer Company No. 1. The company's first equipment was a 1901 hand-drawn chemical apparatus, with a tank containing {{a mixture of}} water and sodium bicarbonate. Sulfuric acid would {{be added to the}} tank, creating carbon dioxide, which would propel the solution through the hose and help extinguish the fire. That first apparatus was white, which Messinger thought more visible than the conventional red in a village without street lights, and the village's engines remain white.|$|E
5|$|This {{incident}} arose after Earp {{learned that}} one of his prize horses, stolen <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>before,</b> was in the possession of Ike Clanton and his brother Billy. Earp and Holliday rode to the Clanton ranch near Charleston to recover the horse. On the way, they overtook Behan, who was riding in a wagon. Behan was also heading to the ranch to serve an election-hearing subpoena on Ike Clanton. Accounts differ as to what happened next. Earp later testified that {{when he arrived at the}} Clanton ranch, Billy Clanton gave up the horse even before being presented with ownership papers. According to Behan's testimony, however, Earp had told the Clantons that Behan was on his way to arrest them for horse theft. After the incident, which embarrassed both the Clantons and Behan, Behan testified that he did not want to work with Earp and chose Woods instead.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{chaired the}} government's Industrial Development Advisory Board from 1973 to 1980. In this {{position}} {{he found himself}} frustrated by Secretary of State for Industry Tony Benn's decision to ignore the board's advice and found workers' co-operative schemes at struggling firms Triumph Engineering and Fisher-Bendix in the early 1970s. Clark decided not to resign but to stay on and try to restrain Benn in the future. Benn bore him no ill-will for this and in 1974 asked him to join the government committee into the future of ailing car-makers Austin and British Leyland. He agreed to take the chair of Leyland in 1976 as a stop-gap measure but ended up holding the post for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> the company, beset with strikes, nationalised and he handed the chair to Michael Edwardes. Clark remained a board member and in 1986 undertook discussions with General Motors {{in an attempt to}} get an increased bid for Leyland Vehicles, a bid later stopped by public outcry over the inclusion of the Land Rover name.|$|E

The Tiananmen protests initially began as a spontaneous public mourning for Hu, but evolved into nationwide protests supporting political reform and demanding an end to Party corruption.|$|E

In fact, Golos {{was one of the}} Soviet Union's most {{important}} intelligence agents in the United States. At the time when he and Bentley met, Golos was involved in planning the assassination of Leon Trotsky, which would take place in Mexico in 1940. Bentley and Golos soon became lovers, although it would be <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> she learned his true name, and, according to her later testimony, two years before she knew that he was working for Soviet intelligence.|$|E

He served little <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> he was deposed by Pat Morton. In 1957 he retired from politics and returned to his legal career before retiring.

25|$|While it is {{not known}} how many {{soldiers}} died during the First Battle of the River Raisin on January 18, 1813, official counts list 397 Americans killed and 27 wounded during the January 22 conflict. Also, figures for those who were killed during the subsequent River Raisin Massacre are unknown, but estimates are as high as 100 killed. Two weeks after the battle, Brigadier General James Winchester reported that 547 of his men were taken as prisoners and only 33 escaped the battlefield. Many of those who were held as prisoners were detained at Fort Malden by the British {{until the end of the}} war over two years later. Winchester was imprisoned for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> being released and reassigned to military service.|$|E

During the 1978–82 period her relationship with the Met severely deteriorated when Sutherland had to decline the role of Constanze in Mozart's Die Entführung aus dem Serail, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> the rehearsals were scheduled to start. The opera house management then declined to stage the operetta The Merry Widow especially for her, as requested; subsequently, she did not perform at the Met during that time at all, even though a production of Rossini's Semiramide had also been planned, but later she returned there to sing in other operas.|$|E

He needed to find a new printer for the photogravures for Camera Work, which had been printed in Germany for many years. The war caused a significant downturn in the American economy and art became a luxury for many people. By the end of the year, Stieglitz was struggling to keep both 291 and Camera Work alive.

25|$|A little <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> his death, Minkowski {{introduced}} his geometric interpretation of spacetime {{to the public}} on November 5, 1907 in a lecture to the Göttingen Mathematical society with the title, The Relativity Principle (Das Relativitätsprinzip). In the original version of this lecture, Minkowski continued to use such obsolescent terms as the ether, but the posthumous publication in 1915 of this lecture in the Annals of Physics (Annalen der Physik) was edited by Sommerfeld to remove this term. Sommerfeld also edited the published form of this lecture to revise Minkowski's judgement of Einstein from being a mere clarifier {{of the principle of}} relativity, to being its chief expositor. On December 21, 1907, Minkowski spoke again to the Göttingen scientific society, and on September 21, 1908, Minkowski presented his famous talk, Space and Time (Raum und Zeit), to the German Society of Scientists and Physicians.|$|E
