25|$|A {{traditional}} samovar {{consists of}} a large <b>metal</b> <b>container</b> with a tap near the bottom and a metal pipe running vertically through the middle. The pipe is filled with solid fuel which is ignited to heat {{the water in the}} surrounding container. A small (6 to 8inch) smoke-stack is put on the top to ensure draft. After the water boils and the fire is extinguished, the smoke-stack can be removed and a teapot placed on top to be heated by the rising hot air. The teapot is used to brew a strong concentrate of tea known as заварка (zavarka). The tea is served by diluting this concentrate with кипяток (kipyatok) (boiled water) from the main container, usually at a water:tea ratio of 10:1, although tastes vary.|$|E

500|$|In some areas, an earth closet was used. Invented by Henry Moule, {{this system}} used a <b>metal</b> <b>container</b> {{as with the}} pail system, but small amounts of a mixture of peat, dry earth and ashes were used to cover the excreta, {{removing}} any smells almost immediately. [...] These deodorisers were often applied with a small scoop or shovel, but more elaborate systems existed where the powder was kept in a box near the seat, with a small handle to control the amount deposited on the excrement. [...] Charcoal—which could be obtained cheaply from street-sweepings—and sawdust were also used to good effect. [...] The process was {{more expensive than the}} simpler pail system. [...] The mixture of earth and excreta could often be dried and re-used, but the fear of infections meant that it was sometimes used instead as a garden fertiliser.|$|E
