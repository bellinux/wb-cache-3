5|$|A third {{attempt was}} planned for September 13; bad weather delayed {{attempts}} until September 16. However, General Schuyler was {{by this time}} so ill that he thought it necessary to withdraw to Ticonderoga. He left that day, turning full command of the invasion over to Montgomery. Schuyler {{was not the only}} one falling ill; the bad weather, and the swampy, malaria-infested terrain of Île-aux-Noix was also taking a toll on the troops, as <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> became ill as well. The bad news was tempered by good; an additional 250 troops, in the form of a company of Green Mountain Boys under Seth Warner, and another company of New Hampshire men under Colonel Timothy Bedel, arrived at Île-aux-Noix.|$|E
5|$|His name {{also appears}} on several mud seal {{impressions}} found at Quesna (in the Delta), Zawyet el'Aryan, Hierakonpolis, and Elephantine. Most {{of the mud}} seals were excavated at modern-day Elephantine; {{it is possible that}} <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> lie under the garden of the current museum of Elephantine. These seal impressions bear more inscriptions than the stone bowls, however most of the seals are only preserved as small fragments and their surfaces have been roughened over the years.|$|E
5|$|Underestimating the {{strength}} of Allied forces on Guadalcanal, which at that time numbered about 11,000 personnel, Ichiki's unit conducted a nighttime frontal assault on Marine positions at Alligator Creek {{on the east side}} of the Lunga perimeter. Ichiki's assault was defeated with heavy losses for the Imperial attackers. The Marine units counterattacked Ichiki's surviving troops after daybreak, killing many <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> All but 128 of the original 917 of the Ichiki Regiment's First Element were killed in the battle.|$|E

5|$|Galland {{returned}} to action on 22 August replacing Gotthard Handrick as Geschwaderkommodore of JG 26. Galland's appointment made {{no impact on}} his successes. From 25 August—14 September 1940, Galland filed claims for victories 23–32. This included three claims on 31 August 1940 for two Spitfires and a Hurricane to take his tally to 27. His 25th victim may have been from 19 Squadron which was claimed 20 kilometers south of Cambridge at 09:42. Klaus Mietusch also accounted for one for his 7th victory. Three 19 Squadron Spitfires were shot down in the morning near North Weald. Pilot Officer R.A.C Aeberhardt {{was killed in a}} crash-landing in Spitfire R6912 while Flying Officer T.J.B Coward was wounded in the foot and F.N Brinsden was unhurt. He bailed out of R6958. On 6 September, Galland claimed his 30th victory over a 610 Squadron Hurricane. JG 26 claimed two <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> shot down that morning. 610 lost four Hurricanes; Flying Officer W.H Rhodes-Moorehouse and C.R Davis were killed while Flying Officer J. Toplnicki and Pilot Officer H.T Gilbert were wounded.|$|E
5|$|The High Middle Ages was {{a period}} of {{tremendous}} expansion of population. The estimated population of Europe grew from 35 to 80 million between 1000 and 1347, although the exact causes remain unclear: improved agricultural techniques, the decline of slaveholding, a more clement climate and the lack of invasion have all been suggested. As much as 90per cent of the European population remained rural peasants. Many were no longer settled in isolated farms but had gathered into small communities, usually known as manors or villages. These peasants were often subject to noble overlords and owed them rents and other services, in a system known as manorialism. There remained a few free peasants throughout this period and beyond, with <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> in the regions of Southern Europe than in the north. The practice of assarting, or bringing new lands into production by offering incentives to the peasants who settled them, also contributed to the expansion of population.|$|E
25|$|The {{slaves were}} {{owned by the}} boyars, the Christian Orthodox monasteries, or the state. Initially, they were used only as smiths, gold panners and as {{agricultural}} workers, but when the principalities became more urbanized, increasingly <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were used as domestic workers.|$|E

25|$|There were {{at least}} four US {{government}} officials on the passenger list with rumours, never confirmed, of a fifth on board.

25|$|A {{significant}} number of Dominican Americans are young, first-generation immigrants without a higher education, since many have roots in the country's rural areas. Second-generation Dominican Americans are more educated than their first-generation counterparts, a condition reflected in their higher incomes and employment in professional or skilled occupations and <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> pursuing undergraduate education and graduate degrees.|$|E
25|$|Other {{commentators}} {{have suggested that}} Vincent van Gogh may have suffered from acute intermittent porphyria. It has also been speculated that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon suffered from some form of porphyria as described in Daniel 4.

25|$|The current KC-X program follows earlier {{attempts}} by the USAF to procure a new tanker. A 2002 plan had the USAF leasing Boeing KC-767 tankers, followed by a 2003 modification where the USAF would buy most of the KC-767 aircraft and lease several <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Corruption investigations revealed wrongdoing in the award of the contract and the contract was canceled in 2005, {{setting the stage for}} the KC-X program.|$|E
25|$|One {{option would}} be to build {{additional}} Polaris platforms and keep <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> at sea. Two Resolutions would throw 96 warheads and almost guarantee penetration, while three {{would make it a}} certainty. This would require a fleet of at least five submarines to keep two on station at all times, as well as larger crew complements, training and logistics support, and appeared to be the most expensive option.|$|E
25|$|When critics {{closed in}} and accused Samuel Ireland of forgery, his son {{published}} a confession – An Authentic Account of the Shaksperian Manuscripts – but many critics {{could not believe}} a young man could have forged them all by himself. One paper published a caricature in which William Henry is awed by the findings {{when the rest of}} the family forges <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> (as opposed to what was really going on).

25|$|In their decision, {{the court}} wrote, The case was not brought {{to serve a}} special {{national}} interest like treason or terrorism different from the normal state interest in punishing murder.

25|$|Initially, {{at least}} 396 people, mostly hostages, were {{reportedly}} {{killed during the}} crisis. By 7 September 2004, Russian officials revised the death toll to 334, including 186 children, although close to 200 people remained missing or unidentified. It was claimed by the locals that over 200 of those killed were found with burns, and 100 or <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were burned alive.

The player is able to collect lightning icons that give Bartman the ability to shoot lightning bolts at enemies. His other weapons are kicking and punching. In addition, Bartman must avoid the deadly traps that are scattered at various places in the levels.|$|E
25|$|Smaller bombs {{meant that}} bombers could carry <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> {{and also that}} they could be carried on the new {{generation}} of rockets in development in the 1950s and 1960s. U.S. rocket science received a large boost in the postwar years, largely with the help of engineers acquired from the Nazi rocketry program. These included scientists such as Wernher von Braun, who had helped design the V-2 rockets the Nazis launched across the English Channel. An American program, Project Paperclip, had endeavored to move German scientists into American hands (and away from Soviet hands) and put them to work for the U.S.|$|E
25|$|No {{definite}} relation {{exists between}} the annual rings of growth {{and the amount of}} sapwood. Within the same species the cross-sectional area of the sapwood is very roughly proportional {{to the size of the}} crown of the tree. If the rings are narrow, <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> are required than where they are wide. As the tree gets larger, the sapwood must necessarily become thinner or increase materially in volume. Sapwood is relatively thicker in the upper portion of the trunk of a tree than near the base, because the age and the diameter of the upper sections are less.|$|E
