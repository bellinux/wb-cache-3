High rates of CA-MRSA skin and soft tissue {{infection}} have been reported from Aboriginal communities. We used a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping typing system based on the multilocus sequence type (MLST) database to investigate the epidemiology of CA-MRSA and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) over a 12 -month period in three remote Aboriginal communities of Northern Australia. This was supplemented by real-time PCR for Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. S. aureus was recovered from pyoderma lesions on 221 occasions and throat swabs on 44 occasions. The median monthly recovery rate of S. aureus from skin sores was 58 % (interquartile range, 62 to 78 %), and there was no seasonal variation. Twenty-three percent of isolates were CA-MRSA; the proportion was similar across the communities and did not vary over the study period. Erythromycin resistance was found in 47 % of CA-MRSA and 21 % of MSSA. SNP-based typing identified 14 different clonal complexes (cc); however, cc 75 was predominant, accounting for 71 % of CA-MRSA isolates. These were confirmed as ST 75 -like by using an additional SNP and MLST of selected isolates. All but one of the cc 75 isolates had SSCmec type IV (one had type V), and all were PVL negative. <b>Monthly</b> <b>tracking</b> of SNP-based cc types showed a highly dynamic process.

Surveillance is specified to car alarm system and the means of sending the data to the owner of the vehicle using SMS when the alarm is triggered. Due to the inefficient conventional car security system, the possibility of the car can be stolen is high. The main reason is that the alarm is limited to the audible distance. Somehow if there is another way of transmitting the alarm to the car owner,tracking the vehicle,knowing the exactly that the car is been stolen at the same time that is not limited to the audible and line of sight, the system can be upgraded.

40|$|BACKGROUND In girls, puberty is {{accompanied}} by the adolescent growth spurt, a large influx of oestrogen, {{as well as an}} increased risk of sustaining a non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. The rapid growth and hormonal changes experienced by girls throughout puberty are thought {{to play a role in}} this increased injury risk, contributing to altered lower limb inertial properties, ultimately affecting lower limb flexibility and strength, with the potential to influence landing biomechanics. However, the longitudinal changes in musculoskeletal structure and function, as well as oestrogen levels, in addition to the longitudinal development of landing technique throughout the adolescent growth spurt in girls, remains unclear. THESIS AIM The primary purpose of this thesis was to investigate the longitudinal changes in musculoskeletal structure and function, as well as the oestrogen levels, during the adolescent growth spurt in girls and the influence of these changes on lower limb landing biomechanics. METHODS Forty-six healthy girls, aged 10 - 13 years, were recruited for this longitudinal study based on their pubertal development (Tanner Stage II-III) and their time from peak height velocity (maturity offset; - 6 to - 4 months or 0 months). Participants were tested up to four times during the 12 months of their adolescent growth spurt, according to their maturity offset (Test 1 : maturity offset = - 6 to - 4 months, Test 2 : maturity offset = 0 months, Test 3 : maturity offset = + 4 months, Test 4 : maturity offset = + 8 months). During the laboratory test sessions, each participant’s anthropometric characteristics, oestrogen levels, anterior knee joint laxity, lower limb flexibility, isokinetic strength and landing biomechanics were collected and recorded. The landing task performed was a horizontal leap movement, during which ground reaction forces (1, 000 Hz), lower limb electromyography (1, 000 Hz) and kinematic data (100 Hz) were collected. <b>Monthly</b> <b>tracking</b> was also conducted, so as to estimate maturity offset using anthropometric data, as well as to determine monthly fluctuations in lower limb flexibility and strength. Results from this longitudinal study were analysed and presented in four chapters (Chapter 3 - 6), with each chapter systematically contributing to the overall thesis aim. The primary purpose of Chapter 3 was to determine the longitudinal changes in anthropometry, anterior knee joint laxity, lower limb flexibility and strength, as well as the oestrogen levels, in pubescent girls during their growth spurt. Based on the findings from Chapter 3, the effects of variations in hamstring muscle strength (Chapter 4) and anterior knee joint laxity (Chapter 5) on the lower limb landing biomechanics of these pubescent girls were investigated. Finally, based on the longitudinal musculoskeletal changes displayed by girls in Chapter 3, the final experimental chapter of this thesis investigated the longitudinal changes in lower limb landing technique displayed by pubescent girls through their adolescent growth spurt (Chapter 6). MAJOR CONCLUSIONS Based on the findings of this thesis it was concluded that during the adolescent growth spurt, pubescent girls display rapid growth of their lower limbs, an increase in anterior knee laxity, as well as a lag in the development of their hamstring muscle strength relative to their quadriceps muscle strength. The combination of these rapid and differential musculoskeletal structural and functional changes are thought to decrease knee joint stability during landing and are likely to contribute to the changes in landing technique that were evident during this time of rapid growth. The outcomes of this research provide a greater understanding of the lower limb musculoskeletal structural and functional changes throughout the adolescent growth spurt in girls, as well as the influence of these changes on landing technique in these pubescent girls...|$|E

Fire affected areas were independently mapped {{at the same}} spatio-temporal resolution from AVHRR imagery. Weather station records were spatially interpolated to create monthly rainfall surfaces. Vegetation structural classes were derived from a digitized map of northern Australian vegetation communities (1 : 1, 000, 000).

Vegetation height and fAPAR are positively correlated, excluding the special case of open heathland. The RG signal is highest where intermediate annual rainfall and strong seasonality in rainfall coincide, and is associated with vegetation structure as follows: RG(open grassland) > RG(woodland) > RG(open forest) > RG(open heathland) > RG(low woodland) > RG(open woodland) > RG(low open woodland) > RG(closed forest). <b>Monthly</b> RG <b>tracks</b> <b>monthly</b> rainfall.

RG-EG patterns are strongly associated with fire frequency patterns. PB is maximal in areas of high RG, where high biomass production during the wet season supports abundant fine fuel during the dry season.
