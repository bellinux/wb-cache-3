5|$|The codex was {{probably}} {{written in the}} 6th century at the library in Caesarea, later coming into the possession of the monastery of the Great Lavra on <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos,</b> but its value {{appears to have been}} overlooked. Leaves of the codex were used as raw material for the production of new volumes. In 975 some leaves, now known as Fragmenta Mosquensia, were used to cover a volume of Gregory Nazianzen at <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos.</b> In the 12th century Fragmenta Taurinensia were used in Nicetas' catenae to the Psalterium, in 1218 another part, now named as Fragmenta Coisliniana, were used with the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the fleet}} crossed to Thasos, {{resulting}} in the Thasians submitting to the Persians. The fleet then rounded the coastline as far as Acanthus in Chalcidice, before attempting to round the headland of <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos.</b> However, they were caught in a violent storm, which drove them against the coastline of Athos, wrecking (according to Herodotus) 300 ships, {{with the loss of}} 20,000 men.|$|E
5|$|Several {{manuscripts and}} early printed {{versions}} of De Materia Medica survive, including the illustrated Vienna Dioscurides manuscript {{written in the}} original Greek in sixth-century Constantinople; it was used there by the Byzantines as a hospital text for just over a thousand years. Sir Arthur Hill saw a monk on <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos</b> still using a copy of Dioscorides to identify plants in 1934.|$|E
5|$|The {{rectangular}} narthex {{constitutes the}} middle {{part of the}} building, between the atrium and the cella, and serves as {{the lobby of the}} church. It lies directly east of the atrium, through a wide gate flanked by a couple of high circular turrets. Mavrodinov likens the narthex of the Round Church to similar structures in the churches of <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos,</b> because of its depth.|$|E
5|$|If Stephen fathered two {{or three}} sons named Alexandru, {{the one who was}} for a while his {{designated}} successor was born to Evdochia of Kiev, whom Stephen married in 1463. An Olelkovich, she was closely related both to Ivan III of Moscow, and to Casimir IV of Poland and Lithuania. Stephen's charter of grant to the Hilandar Monastery on <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos</b> refers to two children of Stephen and Evdochia, Alexandru and Olena. Olena was the wife of Ivan Molodoy, the eldest son of Ivan III, and mother of the usurped heir Dmitry.|$|E
5|$|Since {{this was}} to be a {{full-scale}} invasion, it required long-term planning, stock-piling and conscription. It was decided that Xerxes' Pontoon Bridges were to be set up to allow his army to cross the Hellespont to Europe, and that a canal should be dug across the isthmus of <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos</b> (rounding which headland, a Persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC). These were both feats of exceptional ambition, which would have been beyond any contemporary state. However, the campaign was delayed one year because of another revolt in Egypt and Babylonia.|$|E
5|$|Marko, age 300, {{rode the}} 160-year-old Šarac by the {{seashore}} towards Mount Urvina when a vila {{told him that}} he was going to die. Marko then leaned over a well and saw no reflection of his face on the water; hydromancy confirmed the vilas words. He killed Šarac so the Turks would not use him for menial labor, and gave his beloved companion an elaborate burial. Marko broke his sword and spear, throwing his mace far out to sea before lying down to die. His body was found seven days later by Abbot Vaso and his deacon, Isaija. Vaso took Marko to <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos</b> and buried him at the Hilandar Monastery in an unmarked grave.|$|E
5|$|The first {{campaign}} in 492 BC, led by Mardonius, re-subjugated Thrace and forced Macedon {{to become a}} fully subordinate client kingdom part of Persia, after being a vassal to Persia {{as early as the}} late 6th century BC. However, further progress was prevented when Mardonius's fleet was wrecked in a storm off the coast of <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos.</b> The following year, having demonstrated his intentions, Darius sent ambassadors to all parts of Greece, demanding their submission. He received it from almost all of them, except Athens and Sparta, both of whom executed the ambassadors. With Athens still defiant, and Sparta now effectively at war with him, Darius ordered a further military campaign for the following year.|$|E
5|$|The first campaign, in 492 BC, {{was led by}} Darius's {{son-in-law}} Mardonius, who re-subjugated Thrace, {{which had}} nominally {{been part of the}} Persian empire since 513 BC. Mardonius was also able to force Macedon to become a fully subordinate client kingdom of Persia; it had previously been a vassal, but retained a broad degree of autonomy. However, further progress in this campaign was prevented when Mardonius's fleet was wrecked in a storm off the coast of <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos.</b> Mardonius himself was then injured in a raid on his camp by a Thracian tribe, and after this he returned {{with the rest of the}} expedition to Asia.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they did}} not fix their {{schedules}} to the clock in the modern sense, ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than DST does, often dividing daylight into twelve hours regardless of daytime, so that each daylight hour was longer during summer. For example, the Romans kept time with water clocks that had different scales for different months of the year: at Rome's latitude the third hour from sunrise, hora tertia, started by modern standards at 09:02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter solstice, but at the summer solstice it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes. After ancient times, equal-length civil hours eventually supplanted unequal, so civil time no longer varies by season. Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings, such as some monasteries of <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos</b> and all Jewish ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|While being {{reproduced}} in manuscript form through the centuries, the text was often supplemented with commentary and minor additions from Arabic and Indian sources. Several illustrated manuscripts of De Materia Medica survive. The most famous is the lavishly illustrated Vienna Dioscurides, {{written in the}} original Greek in Byzantine Constantinople in 512/513 AD; the Naples Dioscurides and Morgan Dioscurides are somewhat later Byzantine manuscripts in Greek, while other Greek manuscripts survive today in the monasteries of <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos.</b> Densely illustrated Arabic copies survive from the 12th and 13th centuries. The result is {{a complex set of}} relationships between manuscripts, involving translation, copying errors, additions of text and illustrations, deletions, reworkings, and a combination of copying from one manuscript and correction from another.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{remarkable}} events of Tamar's reign was {{the foundation of}} the Empire of Trebizond on the Black Sea coast in 1204. This state was established by Alexios I Megas Komnenos (r. 1204–1222) and his brother, David, in the northeastern Pontic provinces of the crumbling Byzantine Empire with the aid of Georgian troops. Alexios and David, Tamar's relatives, were fugitive Byzantine princes raised at the Georgian court. According to Tamar's historian, the aim of the Georgian expedition to Trebizond was to punish the Byzantine emperor Alexios IV Angelos (r. 1203–1204) for his confiscation of a shipment of money from the Georgian queen to the monasteries of Antioch and <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos.</b> However, Tamar's Pontic endeavor can better be explained by her desire {{to take advantage of the}} Western European Fourth Crusade against Constantinople to set up a friendly state in Georgia's immediate southwestern neighborhood, as well as by the dynastic solidarity to the dispossessed Komnenoi.|$|E
5|$|Darius {{therefore}} began {{raising a}} huge new army {{with which he}} meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his Egyptian subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition. Darius then died whilst preparing to march on Egypt, and the throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I. Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt, and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece. Since {{this was to be}} a full-scale invasion, it required long-term planning, stock-piling and conscription. Xerxes decided that the Hellespont would be bridged to allow his army to cross to Europe, and that a canal should be dug across the isthmus of <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos</b> (rounding which headland, a Persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC). These were both feats of exceptional ambition, which would have been beyond any contemporary state. By early 480 BC, the preparations were complete, and the army Xerxes had mustered at Sardis marched towards Europe, crossing the Hellespont on two pontoon bridges.|$|E
5|$|Following Theodore's coronation, {{there were}} four rulers who claimed the {{imperial}} title and vied for control of Constantinople: Theodore, the Latin Emperor, Robert of Courtenay, John III Doukas Vatatzes of Nicaea, and the young but ambitious John II Asen (r. 1218–41) of Bulgaria. The Latin Empire was a shadow of its former strength: following Poimanenon, the Latins had lost most of their territories in Asia, while in Europe, it was soon reduced to the environs of Constantinople itself. Already in 1224, {{or at least in}} 1225, Theodore captured Chalcidice with <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos,</b> and in spring 1225, he advanced through eastern Macedonia and western Thrace, seizing Christopolis, Xanthi, Gratianopolis, Mosynopolis and Didymoteicho. In an attempt to pre-empt him and block his advance onto Constantinople, the Nicaeans had answered the summons of the inhabitants of Adrianople and taken over the city from the Latins. Theodore however crossed the Evros River and blockaded the city, until it agreed to surrender. The Nicaean army, under the protostrator John Ises and John Kammytzes, was allowed to withdraw unmolested to Asia with ships provided by Theodore.|$|E
5|$|In {{late summer}} 1342, Kantakouzenos, {{accompanied}} by several Serbian magnates, marched into Macedonia {{at the head}} of a Greek and Serbian force, intending to break through to his wife, who still held out at Demotika. His advance was stopped almost immediately before Serres when the city refused to surrender, and the subsequent siege had to be abandoned after an epidemic killed most of his men, forcing him to retreat into Serbia with a rump force of barely 500 soldiers. Dušan led a more successful parallel campaign, capturing Vodena (Edessa). Serbian forces captured Florina and Kastoria shortly afterwards, thereby extending their hold over western Macedonia. The Serbs also expanded their control over Albania, so that by the summer of 1343, with the exception of Angevin-controlled Dyrrhachium, all of the region appears to have fallen under Serbian rule. Morale among Kantakouzenos' followers fell dramatically. Rumours circulated in Constantinople that a dejected Kantakouzenos planned to retire to <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos</b> as a monk, and riots broke out in the city in which several rich men were killed and their houses looted by the populace.|$|E
5|$|Art {{historian}} Josef Strzygowski, who was {{the first}} European to thoroughly study Armenian architecture, and who placed Armenia in the center of European architecture, suggested that several churches and chapels in Western Europe have been influenced by the cathedrals of Etchmiadzin and Bagaran due to similarities found within their plans. According to Strzygowski, some examples of churches influenced by Etchmiadzin and Bagaran are the 9th-century church of Germigny-des-Prés in France (built by Odo of Metz, probably an Armenian) and San Satiro of Milan, Italy. This view was later supported by Alexander Sahinian and Varazdat Harutyunyan. Sahinian suggested that the Armenian church architecture was spread in Western Europe in the 8th–9th centuries by Paulicians, who migrated from Armenia en mase after being suppressed by the Byzantine government during the Iconoclasm period. Sahinian added many other medieval churches in Europe, such as the Palatine Chapel of Aachen in Germany, to the list of churches to have been influenced by the cathedrals of Etchmiadzin and Bagaran and by Byzantine decorative arts. According to Murad Hasratyan, Etchmiadzin's design was spread to Europe via the Byzantine Empire and served as a model—besides Germigny-des-Prés and San Satiro—for the Nea Ekklesia church in Constantinople and the churches of <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos</b> in Greece.|$|E

These were both feats of exceptional ambition, which would have been beyond any other contemporary state. By early 480 BC, the preparations were complete, and the army which Xerxes had mustered at Sardis marched towards Europe, crossing the Hellespont on two pontoon bridges. According to Herodotus, Xerxes' army was so large that, upon arriving at the banks of the Echeidorus River, his soldiers proceeded to drink it dry. In the face of such imposing numbers, many Greek cities capitulated to the Persian demand for a tribute of earth and water.|$|E
5|$|When heavy {{snowfall}} rendered campaigning impossible {{during the}} following winter, Kantakouzenos instead sent envoys, including an embassy of monks from <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos</b> to Constantinople. However, they too were dismissed by the Patriarch. By then, {{almost all of the}} Byzantine provinces and their governors had declared themselves for the regency. Only Theodore Synadenos, an old associate of Kantakouzenos who was the governor of the Empire's second city, Thessalonica, indicated his support. Synadenos had kept his allegiance to Kantakouzenos secret from the city's populace, and intended to surrender Thessalonica in collusion with the local aristocracy. Furthermore, Hrelja, the Serbian magnate and virtually independent ruler of Strumica and the Strymon River valley, seemed to lean towards Kantakouzenos. Consequently, as soon as the weather improved, on 2 March 1342, Kantakouzenos left his wife Irene Asanina, his brother-in-law Manuel Asen and his daughters to hold Demotika and marched west with his army toward Thessalonica. On the way, he first attacked Peritheorion but was repelled and continued westward. Kantakouzenos was however able to take fortress Melnik, where he met with Hrelja to forge an alliance. Their two armies marched toward Thessalonica, but arrived too late to take control. As they approached the city, they were met by Synadenos and other aristocrats, who had fled after an uprising led by a radical popular party, the Zealots. Soon afterwards a fleet of 70 ships led by Apokaukos reinforced the city. Synadenos, whose family had remained behind in Thessalonica, defected to the regency. Apokaukos' son John was appointed governor of Thessalonica, although effective power rested with the Zealots, who for the next seven years led an autonomous regime unparalleled in Byzantine history.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} years of their marriage, Davis and his wife were able to holiday in Greece, taking {{advantage}} {{of the fact that she}} had an uncle who lived near Athens. This allowed Davis to learn about mediaeval Greece at first hand by for example sojourning among the monasteries of <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos</b> travelling on a mule escorted by the <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos</b> policeman.|$|E
25|$|The insurrection in Chalkidiki was, {{from then}} on, {{confined}} to the peninsulas of <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos</b> and Kassandra. On 30 October 1821, an offensive led by the new Pasha of Thessaloniki, Mehmet Emin Abulubud, resulted in a decisive Ottoman victory at Kassandra. The survivors, among them Pappas, were rescued by the Psarian fleet, which took them mainly to Skiathos, Skopelos and Skyros. However, Pappas died en route to join the revolution at Hydra. Sithonia, <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos</b> and Thasos subsequently surrendered on terms.|$|E
25|$|In {{the end of}} 1347 {{or early}} 1348, he {{followed}} Dušan to <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos.</b> He donated the village of Potolino in the lower Struma province to the Chilandar in 1348.|$|E
25|$|During the Greek War of Independence, the monastery, {{being the}} northernmost on the peninsula, {{suffered}} gravely from the Ottoman armies that ravaged <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos.</b> However, during this period, it also experienced {{some degree of}} prosperity.|$|E
25|$|With {{regards to}} the {{instruction}} of the monks, Cyril established in 1749 the Athonite Academy on <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos,</b> and in 1753 he called the eminent theologian and scholar Eugenios Voulgaris to guide it. However the Enlightenment ideas of Voulgaris were too modern for the monks, {{and he had to}} resign in 1758.|$|E
25|$|The Church of the Holy Apostles (Thessaloniki) {{is often}} cited as an archetypal {{structure}} of the late period, when the exterior walls were intricately decorated with complex brickwork patterns or with glazed ceramics. Other churches from the years immediately predating the fall of Constantinople survive on <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos</b> and in Mistra (e.g. Brontochion Monastery).|$|E
25|$|The Eastern Orthodox Church places heavy {{emphasis}} {{and awards}} {{a high level}} of prestige to traditions of monasticism and asceticism with roots in Early Christianity in the Near East and Byzantine Anatolia. The most important centres of Christian Orthodox monasticism are Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula (Egypt) and <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos</b> in Northern Greece.|$|E
25|$|Since 1 January 2011, Greece {{consists}} of thirteen regions subdivided into {{a total of}} 325 municipalities and communities. The regions have their own elected governors and regional councils, however there are seven decentralized administrations, which group from one to three regions under a government-appointed general secretary. There is also one autonomous area, <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cyril was exiled to the Sinai, {{and later}} under Serapheim II {{he was allowed}} to move to the skete of Agia Anna on <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos.</b> In 1763 he {{returned}} to Constantinople to attempt a restoration to the patriarchal throne, but he was promptly and forcibly taken back to Agia Anna, where he died on 27 July 1775.|$|E
25|$|An {{estimated}} 350,000 Serbian citizens visited Greece in 2008. 432,000 Serbians {{visited in}} 2009. Many Serbs visit Greece {{because of the}} important Serbian heritage found in the country. Some of the cultural and religious sites especially important to Serbs include: the Hilandar monastery in <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos,</b> the Zeitenlik cemetery in Thessaloniki, and the island of Corfu.|$|E
25|$|In 1943, Turkey {{arrested the}} Metropolitan of Imbros and Tenedos with other Orthodox clerics. They also confiscated the lands on Imbros {{belonging}} to the monasteries of Great Lavra and Koutloumousiou on <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos,</b> expelled the tenants, and installed settlers; when the Mayor of Imbros and four village elders protested, they were arrested {{and sent to the}} mainland.|$|E
25|$|The dispute {{has led to}} much acrimony, and {{sometimes}} even to violence. Following canonical precepts, some adherents of the old calendar have chosen to abstain from clerical intercommunion with those synods which have embraced the new calendar until the conflict is resolved. The monastic communities on <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos</b> have provided the strongest opposition to the new calendar, and to modernism in general, while still maintaining communion with their mother church.|$|E
25|$|After {{the demise}} of Nikola Altomanović, Prince Lazar emerged as the most {{powerful}} lord on the territory of the former Serbian Empire. Some local nobles resisted Lazar's authority, but they eventually submitted to the prince. That was the case with Nikola Zojić on Mount Rudnik, and Novak Belocrkvić in the valley of the Toplica River. Lazar's large and rich domain was a refuge for Orthodox Christian monks who fled from areas threatened by the Islamic Ottomans. This brought fame to Lazar on <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos,</b> the centre of Orthodox monasticism. The Serbian Church (Serbian Patriarchate of Peć) had since 1350 been in schism with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, the central authority of the Orthodox Christianity. A Serb monk from <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos</b> named Isaija, who distinguished himself as a writer and translator, encouraged Lazar to work on the reconciliation of the two patriarchates. Through efforts of Lazar and Isaija, an ecclesiastical delegation was sent to the Constantinopolitan Patriarch to negotiate the reconciliation. The delegation was successful, and in 1375 the Serbian Church was readmitted into communion with the Patriarchate of Constantinople.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} practices regarding how often Orthodox Christians should go to confession. Some Patriarchates advise confession before each reception of Holy Communion, others advise confessing during {{each of the four}} fasting periods (Great Lent, Nativity Fast, Apostles' Fast and Dormition Fast), and there are many additional variants. Many pastors encourage frequent confession and communion. In some of the monasteries on <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos,</b> the monks will confess their sins daily.|$|E
25|$|In 1192 Nemanja's {{youngest}} son Rastko retired to <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos</b> where he accepted monastic vows {{and took the}} name Sava. This greatly saddened Nemanja. In Rastko's place, Miroslav's son Toljen became Prince of Zahumlje and founded a local dynasty. Serbia seemed once again endangered once as Nemanja's former ally, King Bela of Hungary invaded from the north. However, Nemanja's forces quickly pushed the Hungarians back {{across the border in}} 1193.|$|E
25|$|Nephon {{died in the}} Monastery of Dionysiou on <b>Mount</b> <b>Athos</b> in 1508. Immediately {{after his}} death he was honored as a saint in many areas and the Eastern Orthodox Church {{recognized}} him as a saint just nine years later, in 1517, setting his feast day on August 11. His relic is kept in a shrine in the Monastery of Dionysiou, {{where there is a}} chapel in his name.|$|E
