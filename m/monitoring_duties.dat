5000|$|Beginning in 1986 the Canadian {{government}} of Brian Mulroney began pressing the Reagan administration for an [...] "Acid Rain Treaty" [...] {{in order to}} do something about U.S. industrial air pollution causing acid rain in Canada. The Reagan administration was hesitant, and questioned the science behind Mulroney's claims. However, Mulroney was able to prevail. The product was the signing and ratification of the Air Quality Agreement of 1991 by the first Bush administration. Under that treaty, the two governments consult semi-annually on trans-border air pollution, which has demonstrably reduced acid rain, and they have since signed an annex to the treaty dealing with ground level ozone in 2000. Despite this, trans-border air pollution remains an issue, particularly in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence watershed during the summer. The main source of this trans-border pollution results from coal-fired power stations, most of them located in the Midwestern United States. As part of the negotiations to create NAFTA, Canada and the U.S. signed, along with Mexico, the North American Agreement On Environmental Cooperation which created the Commission for Environmental Cooperation which monitors environmental issues across the continent, publishing the North American Environmental Atlas as one aspect of its <b>monitoring</b> <b>duties.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The mission's {{original}} mandate {{was established}} by United Nations Security Council Resolution 696 (1991), passed on May 30, 1991.

[...] After a series of Security Council resolutions in 1993, the mandate was again altered to encourage more stringent adherence to the ceasefire by both the government of Angola and UNITA, after a resumption of hostilities. Finally, in late 1994, with Security Council Resolutions 952 (1994) and 966 (1994), UNAVEM II began observation and verification of the Lusaka Protocol of November 20, 1994. Preparations were begun to make way for the new mission, United Nations Angola Verification Mission III (UNAVEM III), set up in the wake of the Lusaka Protocol.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Hebrew National {{switched}} to an external certification group, the Triangle K, {{under the auspices}} of Rabbi Aryeh Ralbag, which was widely seen as somewhat of an upgrade in its standards of kashrut. In 2004, the Conservative Movement found the upgrade sufficient to be acceptable by Conservative standards. [...] The Rabbis Ralbag and Plotkin conferred jointly and developed a strategy for consistent monitoring of the products labeled kosher by Hebrew National. By reducing production facilities to just one location, expenses were dramatically reduced for upkeep, utilities, employees, and maintenance. The production process was streamlined so that a viewing station kept an eye on each individual sausage that passed through the facility. Rabbis Plotkin and Ralbag share <b>monitoring</b> <b>duties</b> amongst a group of other Rabbis, allowing for a pure and reliable dedication to the purveyance of Kosher hot dogs. Hebrew National hot dogs are, in this way, able to claim their product as Kosher. In a blog post on the subject, Conservative rabbi and kosher certification entrepreneur Jason Miller lamented the fact that in several baseball stadiums in the United States, Hebrew National hot dogs are publicized as kosher [...] "when in fact they are cooked on the same grill as the non-kosher hot dogs and sausages" [...] and served on dairy hot dog buns.|$|E

She explained that she desired to return to Earth-Two, her birthplace, to adjust, among her friends and places she misses. Green Arrow supported her decision and they both journeyed to the Justice League Headquarters to use the Transmatter Machine, the device used to travel from Earth-One to Earth-Two. Hawkman, who was on <b>monitor</b> <b>duty,</b> explained that the device was unstable due to a battle with Professor Phineas Potter and needed to be repaired. Green Arrow ignored the warnings and used the machine to transport himself and Black Canary to Earth-Two.

Only four heroes escaped the fate: Green Arrow and Black Canary, and Superman and Batman, who were in outer space at the time.|$|R
50|$|The {{injection}} of fuel or the quantity of injected fuel has a decisive influence on engine starting, idling, power and emissions. The engine ECU is programmed ("mapped") with relevant data to where the fuel rack position has an equivalent signal {{for the amount of}} fuel being injected. The driver requests the torque or engine speed requirements via accelerator pedal potentiometer thereby sending a signal to the engine ECU which then, depending on its mapping and data collected from various sensors, calculates in real time the quantity of injected fuel required, thus altering the fuel rack to the required position.The driver can also input additional commands such as idle speed increase to compensate e.g. for PTO operation which can be either variably set or has a preset speed which can be recalled. The road speed function can be used to evaluate vehicle speed and possibly activate a speed limiter (Heavy Vehicles), or maintain or restore a set speed (cruise control). Further functions can include exhaust brake operation which, when activated, will result in the fuel pump rack position being set to zero delivery or idle. The engine ECU can also interface with various other vehicle systems e.g. traction control and carry out self <b>monitoring</b> <b>duties</b> and self diagnostic functions to keep the system working at an optimal level. To ensure the safe operation in case of failure, the limp home mode functions are also integrated into the system, e.g. should the pump speed sensor fail the ECU can use an alternator speed signal function for engine RPMs counter as a backup signal.|$|E

In the second essay, I consider how creditors and shareholders interact when both actively monitor the manager.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the concept of}} complemation- complementary technology {{that is designed to}} enhance human skills and abilities rather than replace them. Complemation differs from automation in that it utilizes human skills and functions in a critical rather than ancillary role. The machine is used primarily for monitoring and precise implementation and the human is the primary decision-maker and outer loop performer. In this way, the human remains engaged in the task and aware of the situation. Traditional automation approaches relegate <b>monitoring</b> <b>duties</b> to humans, which are inherently poor monitors of highly reliable systems, while expecting them to intervene in cases where the automation cannot perform. The paper argues that such traditional automation can set the human up for failure...|$|E

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{symposium}} celebrating the multiple contributions of the late Alan Bromberg, this article examines implications flowing from the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Omnicare Inc. v. Laborers District Council Construction Industry Pension Fund. Because Omnicare lands so squarely on the Court’s earlier opaque opinion in Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg addressing {{the treatment of the}} materiality of opinion statements, Omnicare is the new currency in the realm that will have far-reaching implications. In Virginia Bankshares, the Supreme Court quickly concluded shareholders would attach significance to the board of directors’ statement that the cash-out merger price was “fair” and “high” so that the statement met the materiality standard, but emphasized there was another, more perplexing, issue: whether such an opinion statement was a statement of fact. On this question, Virginia Bankshares’ formulation is hopelessly ambiguous. As developed in this article, Omnicare Inc. returns the focus to the traditional orientation of the information’s significance to the investor and thereby not only provides an understandable, indeed conventional vis-à-vis the common law, but also harbors the strong potential to dramatically change existing approaches to how we view general statements that provide optimism and reassurance, for example “puffery statements” or even what constitutes “meaningful cautionary language under the Bespeaks Caution Doctrine. The article also provides insight to how Omnicare complements the positive contributions of state law doctrine that has developed in the wake of Omnicare Inc. v.
