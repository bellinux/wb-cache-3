5000|$|For the {{long-term}} preservation of organic material <b>like</b> <b>parchment,</b> the ideal temperature range is 10-15&#176;C with a relative humidity level of 30-50%. The ideal storage and display environment is oxygen-free, as oxygen prevalence {{has been shown}} to react with collagen over time, leading to increased brittleness of parchment. Oxygen-free storage and display cases are filled with inert gas as well as a chemical substance that reacts as an absorber if any stray oxygen leaks into the encasement.|$|R

60|$|He relapsed into a day-dream, {{from which}} he was aroused only by the soft flutter of gowns and laces as the women rose to go. There was a {{momentary}} disarrangement of seats. Gilbert Deyes, {{who was on the}} other side of the table, rose, and carrying his glass in his hand, came deliberately round to the vacant seat by the young man's side. In his evening clothes, the length and gauntness of his face and figure seemed more noticeable than ever. His skin was dry, almost <b>like</b> <b>parchment,</b> and his eyes by contrast appeared unnaturally bright. His new neighbour noticed, too, that the glass which he carried so carefully contained nothing but water.|$|R
60|$|After six still seconds Turnbull {{could stand}} it no longer, but {{called out to}} the dwarfish thing--in what words heaven knows. The thing got up with the promptitude of an animal, and turning round offered the {{spectacle}} of two owlish eyes and a huge grey-and-white beard not unlike the plumage of an owl. This extraordinary beard covered him literally to his feet (not that that was very far), and perhaps it was as well that it did, for portions of his remaining clothing seemed to fall off whenever he moved. One talks trivially of a face <b>like</b> <b>parchment,</b> but this old man's face was so wrinkled that it was <b>like</b> a <b>parchment</b> loaded with hieroglyphics. The lines of his face were so deep and complex that one could see five or ten different faces besides the real one, as one can see them in an elaborate wall-paper. And yet while his face seemed like a scripture older than the gods, his eyes were quite bright, blue, and startled {{like those of a}} baby. They looked as if they had only an instant before been fitted into his head.|$|R
50|$|Great damage can be {{inflicted on}} a bioprosthesis {{at the time}} of its implantation. One of the not so rare causes is {{allowing}} the cusps of the valve to become dry - to look <b>like</b> <b>parchment</b> - during the time of placement of sutures. Some errors occurred exceptionally: The plastic identification tag remained attached to the valve and became stuck to the left ventricle wall; the sutures meant to secure the introducer were not removed and all three cusps of a valve were limited in their movement; entangling sutures around the stent struts, sometimes around two struts: (one of the incidents was published under the title of 'Fatal bioprosthetic regurgitation immediately after mitral and tricuspid valve replacement with Ionescu-Shiley bioprosthesis').|$|R
60|$|That wretched apology of a {{creature}} stripped from me my dirt-encrusted shirt that I had worn since my entrance to solitary, and exposed my poor wasted body, the skin ridged <b>like</b> brown <b>parchment</b> over the ribs and sore- infested {{from the many}} bouts with the jacket. The examination was shamelessly perfunctory.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a terrible}} only, as {{precious}} moments slipped away before there appeared in the lower chamber Berenger and Humfrey, dragging between them a squalid wretch, with a skin <b>like</b> stained <b>parchment</b> over a skeleton, tangled hair and beard, staring bewildered eyes, and fragments of garments, all dust, dirt, and rags.|$|R

60|$|Syme stood {{staring back}} at the stiff face <b>like</b> <b>parchment</b> and the blank, blue eyes. His {{first thought was that}} the Professor had gone mad, but his second thought was more frightful. After all, what did he know about this queer {{creature}} whom he had heedlessly accepted as a friend? What did he know, except that the man had been at the anarchist breakfast and had told him a ridiculous tale? How improbable it was that there should be another friend there beside Gogol! Was this man's silence a sensational way of declaring war? Was this adamantine stare after all only the awful sneer of some threefold traitor, who had turned for the last time? He stood and strained his ears in this heartless silence. He almost fancied he could hear dynamiters come to capture him shifting softly in the corridor outside.|$|R

60|$|Tir. We must no {{more than}} Fate {{commissions}} us To tell; yet something, and of moment, I'll unfold, If that the god would wake; I feel him now, Like a strong spirit charmed into a tree, That leaps, and moves the wood without a wind: The roused god, as all this while he lay Entombed alive, starts and dilates himself; He struggles, and he tears my aged trunk With holy fury; my old arteries burst; My rivell'd skin, <b>Like</b> <b>parchment,</b> crackles at the hallowed fire; I shall be young again:--Manto, my daughter, Thou hast a voice that might have saved the bard Of Thrace, and forced the raging bacchanals, With lifted prongs, to listen to thy airs. O charm this god, this fury in my bosom, Lull him with tuneful notes, and artful strings, With powerful strains; Manto, my lovely child, Sooth the unruly godhead to be mild.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Porson {{was seated}} {{at the end of}} the table, and Morris, looking at him, noticed with a shock how old he had {{suddenly}} become. His plump, cheerful face had fallen in; the cheeks were quite hollow now; his jaws seemed to protrude, and the skin upon his bald head to be drawn quite tight <b>like</b> the <b>parchment</b> on a drum.|$|R
60|$|The {{fellow was}} {{strongly}} built with {{skin of a}} leathery appearance, <b>like</b> <b>parchment</b> yellowed with age. His hair, which was coal black and three or four inches in length, grew out stiffly {{at right angles to}} his scalp. His eyes were close set and the irises densely black and very small, so that the white of the eyeball showed around them. The man's face was smooth except for a few straggly hairs on his chin and upper lip. The nose was aquiline and fine, but the hair grew so far down on the forehead as to suggest a very low and brutal type. The upper lip was short and fine while the lower lip was rather heavy and inclined to be pendulous, the chin being equally weak. Altogether the face carried the suggestion of a once strong and handsome countenance entirely altered by physical violence or by degraded habits and thoughts. The man's arms were long, though not abnormally so, while his legs were short, though straight.|$|R

Although he was still only in high school, Patel would seriously influence the style of Before Braille's music [...] and, according {{to members of the}} band, significantly improve it. The significance of his contributions to Before Braille are most obvious when discovering that some of the music from his solo-releases, such as <b>Make</b> <b>Like</b> a Tree from Of Black Water and <b>Make</b> <b>Like</b> a Tree Part 2 from Get Phased directly inspire the Before Braille song Ticker Tape Charade, which appeared on the Spring Cleaning album.|$|R

60|$|Donnacona was {{not long}} in putting in an appearance. Whatever may have been his real feelings, the crafty old chief feigned a great delight at the safe return of Cartier. At his {{solicitation}} Cartier paid a ceremonial visit to the settlement of Stadacona, on October 13, ten days after his return. The gentlemen of the expedition, together with fifty sailors, all well armed and appointed, accompanied the leader. The meeting between the Indians and their white visitors was similar to those already described. Indian harangues and wild dancing and shouting were {{the order of the}} day, while Cartier, as usual, distributed knives and trinkets. The French were taken into the Indian lodges and shown the stores of food laid up against the coming winter. Other objects, too, of a new and peculiar interest were displayed: there were the 'scalp locks' of five men--'the skin of five men's heads,' says Cartier,--which were spread out on a board <b>like</b> <b>parchments.</b> The Indians explained that these had been taken from the heads of five of their deadly enemies, the Toudamani, a fierce people living to the south, with whom the natives of Stadacona were perpetually at war.|$|R
60|$|Glass is {{so common}} and so cheap {{that we never}} think of being {{grateful}} for it. But if we had lived a few centuries ago, when the richest people had only wooden shutters to their windows, which, of course, had to be closed whenever it was cold or stormy, making the house as dark as night, and had then been placed in a house lighted by glass windows, we would scarcely have found words to express our thankfulness. It {{would have been like}} taking a man out of a dreary prison and setting him in the bright world of God's blessed sunshine. After a time men made small windows of stones that were partly transparent; and then they used skins prepared something <b>like</b> <b>parchment,</b> and finally they used sashes similar to ours, but in them they put oiled paper. And when at last glass came into use, it was so costly that very few were able to buy it, and they had it taken out of the windows and stored carefully away when they went on a journey, as people now store away pictures and silver-plate.|$|R
60|$|There {{were plenty}} {{of things in the}} chest, such as some odds and ends of {{tapestry}} and old clothes of a Queen Anne character, put here, no doubt, for preservation, as moth does not like this cypress wood. Also there were some books and a mysterious bundle tied up in a curious shawl with stripes of colour running through it. That bundle excited me, and I drew the fringes of the shawl apart and looked in. So far as I could see it contained another dress of rich colours, also a thick packet of what looked <b>like</b> <b>parchment,</b> badly prepared and much rotted upon one side as though by damp, which parchment appeared to be covered with faint black-letter writing, done by some careless scribe with poor ink that had faded very much. There were other things, too, within the shawl, such as a box made of some red foreign wood, but I had not time to investigate further for just then I heard old Potts's foot upon the stair, and thought it best to replace the bundle. He arrived with the lantern and by its light we examined the chest and the poker work.|$|R
