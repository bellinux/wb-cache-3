2500|$|Leonard Kleinrock (born 1934) {{published}} his first paper on queueing theory in digital networks, [...] "Information Flow in Large Communication Nets", in 1961. After completing his Ph.D. thesis in 1962, which provided a fundamental theory of digital <b>message</b> <b>switching,</b> {{he moved to}} UCLA. In the late 1960s, building on his earlier work on queueing theory, Kleinrock carried out theoretical work to model the performance of packet-switched networks, which underpinned {{the development of the}} ARPANET. In 1969, a team at UCLA connected a computer to an Interface Message Processor, becoming the first node on ARPANET. His theoretical work on hierarchical routing in the late 1970s with student Farouk Kamoun remains critical to the operation of the Internet today. In 2012, Kleinrock was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame by the Internet Society.|$|E

50|$|In telecommunications, <b>message</b> <b>switching</b> was the {{precursor}} of packet switching, where messages were routed in their entirety, one hop at a time. It was first built by Collins Radio Company, Newport Beach, California, {{during the period}} 1959-1963 for sale to large airlines, banks and railroads. <b>Message</b> <b>switching</b> systems are nowadays mostly implemented over packet-switched or circuit-switched data networks. Each message is treated as a separate entity. Each message contains addressing information, and at each switch this information is read and the transfer path to the next switch is decided. Depending on network conditions, a conversation of several messages may not be transferred over the same path. Each message is stored (usually on hard drive due to RAM limitations) before being transmitted to the next switch. Because of this it {{is also known as}} a 'store-and-forward' network. Email is a common application for <b>message</b> <b>switching.</b> A delay in delivering email is allowed, unlike real-time data transfer between two computers.|$|E

50|$|In {{the message}} passing approach, the user process {{constructs}} a message, {{that describes the}} desired service. Then it uses a trusted send function to pass the message to a trusted OS process. The send function serves the same purpose as the trap; that is, it carefully checks the <b>message,</b> <b>switches</b> the processor to kernel mode, and then delivers the message to a process that implements the target functions. Meanwhile, the user process waits for {{the result of the}} service request with a message receive operation. When the OS process completes the operation, it sends a message back to the user process.|$|R

All possible destinations are identified by a unique number to allow XLI operation. This scheme allows any protocol layer to use a single sendControl (...) method with a ControlMessage as parameter, to transmit signaling information across the local protocol stack. Of course, object inheritance is used and the transferred message is in fact derived from ControlMessage, containing the proper information.
