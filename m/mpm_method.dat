40|$|This thesis investigates a novel way to {{simulate}} cracks {{as an extension}} of the Mate- rial Point <b>Method</b> (<b>MPM).</b> Previous <b>methods,</b> like CRAMP (CRAcks with Material Points), often use an explicit crack representation to define the material crack. We use an implicit crack representation defined as the intersection between pieces of the original specimen created by a pre-fracture process. Material chunks are there- after forced together using massless particle constraints. The method has proven successful in tearing scenarios, and the main benefits are: (1) minor computational overhead compared to the initial MPM algorithm; (2) simple to implement and scales well in 3 dimensions; (3) gives easy and controllable setup phase for desired material failure mode. The development of the crack extension has required a fully general MPM solver that can handle arbitrarily many distinct bodies connected in the same simulation. Current collision schemes for MPM exists, however these are often focused on two-body collisions and does not scale well for additional objects due to inaccuracies in contact normal calculations. We present a method that uses an iterative pair-wise comparison scheme to resolve grid collisions that extends to any number of collision objects. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{statistical}} inference on functional imaging data is severely {{complicated by the}} embedded multiple testing problem. Defining a region of interest (ROI) where the activation is hypothesized a priori helps to circumvent this problem, since {{in this case the}} inference is restricted to fewer simultaneous tests, rendering it more sensitive. Cytoarchitectonic maps obtained from postmortem brains provide objective, a priori ROIs {{that can be used to}} test anatomically specified hypotheses about the localization of functional activations. We here analyzed three methods for the definition of ROIs based on probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps. (1) ROIs defined by the volume assigned to a cytoarchitectonic area in the summary map of all areas (maximum probability map, MPM), (2) ROIs based on thresholding the individual probabilistic maps and (3) spherical ROIs build around the cytoarchitectonic center of gravity. The quality with which the thus defined ROIs represented the respective cytoarchitectonic areas as well as their sensitivity for detecting functional activations was subsequently statistically evaluated. Our data showed that the <b>MPM</b> <b>method</b> yields ROIs, which reflect most adequately the underlying anatomical hypotheses.

Herein, the diagnostic reliability of an improved five-stage third finger middle phalanx maturation (<b>MPM)</b> <b>method</b> {{in the identification of}} mandibular growth peak has been investigated. SUBJECTS/METHODS: From the files of the Burlington Growth Study, 35 subjects (20 males, 15 females) with at least 7 annual lateral cephalograms taken from 9 to 16 years were included. Mandibular growth was defined as annual increments in condylion-gnathion (Co-Gn) distance. Subsequently, individual annual increments in Co-Gn were arranged according to annual age intervals, with the first and last intervals defined as 9 - 10 years and 14 / 15 - 16 years, respectively. A full diagnostic reliability analysis (including positive likelihood ratio) was performed to establish the diagnostic reliability of the MPM stage 2 (MPS 2) in the identification of the imminent mandibular growth peak [...] RESULTS: The MPS 2 had a satisfactory accuracy in the identification of imminent mandibular growth peak with an overall positive likelihood ratio of 10. 3. However, reliability showed noteworthy variability being greater and lower for younger and older age intervals, respectively.
