40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} is the development of a success model of Knowledge Sharing 2. 0 (social knowledge sharing) through organizations. A three-step strategy is used in this research as stated below: In the first step, identification of social software and extraction of factors effective on success of each for knowledge sharing were obtained from literature review. Execution of Delphi method and identification of critical factors were done in the second step. At last, in the third step, a success model was developed based on the obtained results. According to the results obtained from this study, the most important social software in order of their importance for knowledge sharing along with the most significant success factor of each in knowledge sharing are known to be: social network software (the <b>most</b> important <b>critical</b> success factor: active presence of experts and influential individuals in the desired field of knowledge in the social network), weblog software (the <b>most</b> important <b>critical</b> success factor: quality of existing information in the weblog), wiki software (the <b>most</b> important <b>critical</b> success factor: wiki configuration based on key fields of knowledge in organization), podcast software (the <b>most</b> important <b>critical</b> success factor: extent of applicability and practicality of the podcast contents), mashup software (the <b>most</b> important <b>critical</b> success factor: quality of information from mashup sources), tag software (the <b>most</b> important <b>critical</b> success factor: regular and intelligent updating) and RSS software (the <b>most</b> important <b>critical</b> success factor: continuous updating- 7 × 24). Based on the information available for the researchers, originality and innovation of the current work stem from two viewpoints: first, development of the critical success factors of the social software for knowledge sharing and second, development of the success model of Knowledge Sharing 2. 0. The proposed model can be used as an appropriate tool for evaluation of success, assessment of status, prediction and related pathologies in connection with establishment of Knowledge Sharing 2. 0 in organizations...|$|R

5|$|At Los Alamos, Bradbury became head of E-5, the Implosion Experimentation Group, {{which put}} him {{in charge of the}} {{implosion}} field test program. In August, the laboratory's director, Robert Oppenheimer, implemented a sweeping reorganisation. E-5 became part of George Kistiakowsky's new Explosives Division (X Division), and was renumbered X-1. At this point, Bradbury was leading some of the <b>most</b> <b>critical</b> work at the laboratory, as it struggled with the jets that spoiled the perfect spherical shape desired for the implosion process. These were examined with a combination of magnetic, X-ray and RaLa techniques.|$|E

Mega Man and Metroid were significant influences in its creation. The development was divided between Armature Studio and Comcept into their own distinctive proficiencies, while Asobo Studio assisted. ReCore received mixed reviews, the <b>most</b> <b>critical</b> of which noted insufficient design choices, technical issues regarding lengthy and unsuccessful loading screens – later redressed – and repetitive combat.

The length of the stops is also strongly influenced by which tissue compartments are assessed as highly saturated. High concentrations in slow tissues will indicate longer stops than similar concentrations in fast tissues.|$|E

5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>critical</b> {{period of}} the {{fighting}} in the east occurred when the NK 15th Division broke through the ROK 8th Division to Yongch'on.

But Walker's quick dispatch of the ROK 5th and 11th Regiments from two widely separated sectors of the front {{to the area of}} penetration resulted in destroying the force before it could exploit its breakthrough. Walker was commended for his judgment of the reinforcements needed to stem the North Korean attacks in the Kyongju and Yongch'on areas.|$|E
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>critical</b> problem, however, was a {{shortage}} of ammunition for the PAVN's tanks and heavy artillery (field artillery and mortars 85mm or larger in caliber). By 1974, PAVN's entire stock of heavy artillery and tank ammunition, including all ammunition held by combat units at forward warehouses, and in the PAVN's strategic reserves, totaled just 100,000 rounds. The ammunition problem was so serious that the PAVN artillery command had to replace the larger weapons {{in a number of}} units with obsolete 76.2mm and 57mm artillery pieces drawn out of storage for which there still was adequate ammunition.|$|E

5|$|At Ostend, Vindictive did prevent larger {{warships}} {{passing through}} the channel, although smaller craft could still come and go at will. The larger warships in Bruges were trapped there for the remaining months of the war; the town was captured by the Allies in October 1918. The blockages at Ostend and Zeebrugge took several years to clear completely, not being totally removed until 1921. On a strategic scale {{the effects of the}} raids at Ostend and Zeebrugge on the battle of the Atlantic were negligible. Despite this, in Britain the Ostend Raid was feted as a success. Three Victoria Crosses and a host of lesser awards were given to the men involved. The Admiralty presented it as a fine example of daring and careful planning from the Royal Navy, providing a valuable morale boost at one of the <b>most</b> <b>critical</b> moments of the war.|$|E
5|$|Despite his successes, when Edward I died in 1307 {{he left a}} {{range of}} {{challenges}} for his son to resolve. One of the <b>most</b> <b>critical</b> was the problem of English rule in Scotland, where Edward's long but ultimately inconclusive military campaign was ongoing when he died. Edward's control of Gascony created tension with the French kings. They insisted that the English kings should give homage to them for the lands; the English kings saw this demand as insulting to their honour, and the issue remained unresolved. Edward I also faced increasing opposition from his barons over the taxation and requisitions required to resource his wars, and left his son debts of around £200,000 on his death.|$|E
