5|$|Seoba Srba (English: <b>Migration</b> <b>of</b> the Serbs) {{is a set}} of four similar oil {{paintings}} by the Serbian artist Paja Jovanović that depict Serbs, led by Archbishop Arsenije III, fleeing Old Serbia during the Great Serb <b>Migration</b> <b>of</b> 1690–91. The first was commissioned in 1895 by Georgije Branković, the Patriarch of Karlovci, to be displayed at the following year's Budapest Millennium Exhibition. In the view of the Serbian clergy, it would serve to legitimize Serb claims to religious autonomy and partial self-administration in Austria-Hungary by upholding the contention that Serbs left their homeland {{at the behest of the}} Holy Roman Emperor to protect the Habsburg Monarchy's borders.|$|E
5|$|The North Atlantic {{oscillation}} is an atmospheric phenomenon {{affecting the}} weather in Western Europe. When the atmospheric pressure variations in the North Atlantic are large, the springs in Europe are warmer. This brings forward the northward <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> those bird species (including the goldcrest) that winter mainly within western or southern Europe. A general climatic change resulting in more frequent positive North Atlantic oscillation events has led to earlier spring <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> these short-distance migrants since the 1980s. The warmer spring weather brings on plant growth, thus preparing the habitat for returning migrants. The effect is greatest in western and central Europe.|$|E

5|$|According to K. Indrapala, {{cultural}} diffusion, {{rather than}} <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> people, spread the Prakrit and Tamil languages from peninsular India into an existing mesolithic population, centuries before the common era. Tamil Brahmi and Tamil-Prakrit scripts {{were used to}} write the Tamil language during this period on the island.|$|E
5|$|After 1948, the {{greatest}} impact came from the large <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> Jews from Turkey, Iraq, Kurdistan and Yemen, and Mizrahi Jews from North Africa, particularly Morocco. Typically, the staff of army kitchens, schools, hospitals, hotels and restaurant kitchens has consisted of Mizrahi, Kurdish and Yemenite Jews, and this has had an influence on the cooking fashions and ingredients of the country.|$|E
5|$|C.maenas has {{the ability}} to {{disperse}} by a variety of mechanisms, including ballast water, ships' hulls, packing materials (seaweeds) used to ship live marine organisms, bivalves moved for aquaculture, rafting, <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> crab larvae on ocean currents, and the movement of submerged aquatic vegetation for coastal zone management initiatives. Thresher et al. found C.maenas dispersed in Australia mainly by rare long-distance events, possibly caused by human actions.|$|E

Named for a former manager of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, the festival includes tours of the wetlands and nearby ranches as well as classes in topics such as birdhouse building, Harney County archeology, and bird sketching.|$|E

5|$|In 2003 it was {{hypothesized}} that these clumps could be caused by a roughly Neptune-mass planet having migrated from 40 to 65AU over 56millionyears, an orbit large enough to allow the formation of smaller rocky planets closer to Vega.

5|$|In general, Greece {{enjoyed a}} period of peace and {{prosperity}} during Alexander's campaign in Asia. Alexander sent back vast sums from his conquest, which stimulated the economy and increased trade across his empire. However, Alexander's constant demands for troops and the <b>migration</b> <b>of</b> Macedonians throughout his empire depleted Macedon's manpower, greatly weakening it {{in the years after}} Alexander, and ultimately led to its subjugation by Rome after the Third Macedonian War (171–168 BC).|$|E
