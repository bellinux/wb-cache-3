50|$|Symptoms of {{arterial}} gas embolism may {{be present}} but masked by environmental effects such as hypothermia, or pain from other obvious causes. Neurological examination is recommended when there is suspicion of lung overexpansion injury. Symptoms of decompression <b>sickness</b> <b>may</b> be very similar to, and confused with, symptoms of arterial gas embolism, however, treatment is basically the same. Discrimination between gas embolism and decompression <b>sickness</b> <b>may</b> be difficult for injured divers, and both may occur simultaneously. Dive history <b>may</b> eliminate decompression <b>sickness</b> in many cases, {{and the presence of}} symptoms of other lung overexpansion injury would raise the probability of gas embolism.|$|R

5000|$|Many low-income {{families}} avoid drinking tap water {{because they fear}} it <b>may</b> cause <b>sickness.</b> Bottled, filtered, and tap water are all {{for the most part}} safe in the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency regulations for tap water are [...] "actually stricter than the Food and Drug Administration regulations for bottled water." [...] A study of drinking water in Cincinnati, Ohio, discovered that bacterial counts in bottled water were often higher than those in tap water and fluoride concentration was inconsistent.|$|R
50|$|The sopite {{syndrome}} is likely a cumulative disorder. For instance, when a subject has the flu, a hangover may exacerbate {{the symptoms of}} the illness.

5|$|Wolves {{are often}} infested {{with a variety}} of {{arthropod}} exoparasites, including fleas, ticks, lice, and mites. The most harmful to wolves, particularly pups, is Sarcoptes scabiei (or mange mite), though they rarely develop full blown mange, unlike foxes. Lice, such as Trichodectes canis, <b>may</b> cause <b>sickness</b> in wolves, but rarely death. Ticks of the genus Ixodes can infect wolves with Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The tick Dermacentor pictus also infests wolves. Other ectoparasites include biting lice, sucking lice and the fleas Pulex irritans and Ctenocephalides canis.|$|R
50|$|Although {{some species}} of Amanita are edible, many fungi experts advise against eating {{a member of}} Amanita unless the species is known with {{absolute}} certainty. Because so many species within this genus are so deadly toxic, if a specimen is identified incorrectly, consumption <b>may</b> cause extreme <b>sickness</b> and possibly death.|$|R
5000|$|Virtual reality <b>sickness</b> <b>may</b> have {{undesirable}} consequences {{beyond the}} sickness itself. For example, Crowley (1987) argued that flight simulator sickness could discourage pilots from using flight simulators, reduce {{the efficiency of}} training through distraction and the encouragement of adaptive behaviors that are unfavorable for performance, compromise ground safety or flight safety when sick and disoriented pilots leave the simulator. [...] Similar consequences could be expected for virtual reality systems. Although the evidence for performance decrements due to virtual reality sickness is limited, research does suggest that virtual reality sickness is a major barrier to using virtual reality, indicating that virtual reality <b>sickness</b> <b>may</b> be a barrier to the effective use of training tools and rehabilitation tools in virtual reality. Estimates of the multi-study incidence and main symptoms of virtual reality sickness (also called cybersickness) have been made.|$|R
50|$|The {{perceived}} bad odor of feces {{has been}} hypothesized to be a deterrent for humans, as consuming or touching it <b>may</b> result in <b>sickness</b> or infection. Human {{perception of the}} odor may be contrasted by a non-human animal's perception of it; for example, an animal who eats feces may be attracted to its odor.|$|R
50|$|The {{secondary}} {{source of}} income in the games is purchasing, caring for, and raising livestock. Livestock may produce products which may be sold on a daily basis. Giving animals attention will increase their affection towards the player and may increase {{the quality of their}} products. Neglecting the animals' needs <b>may</b> lead to <b>sickness</b> and even death.|$|R
25|$|The player whose turn it is {{declares}} which creatures {{he or she}} controls will attack. In most cases, {{creatures that}} are tapped, or that entered the battlefield this turn (i.e., creatures with summoning <b>sickness)</b> <b>may</b> not attack.

50|$|Ecuador {{is divided}} into 4 regions; The Andes, The Amazon Basin, The Coast and The Galapagos Islands. Harsh climates in each region pose a number of threats to human health. Due {{to the lack of}} oxygen in the Andes because of high {{altitude}}, altitude <b>sickness</b> <b>may</b> arise. It is mostly tourists coming from low-altitude regions that are affected by altitude sickness.|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning {{is a well}} recognized, but uncommon hazard {{of sport}} and inshore diving, which occurs either {{as a result of}} a faulty air compressor or from air contamination by the exhaust of nearby petrol engines. The incidence of carbon monoxide poisoning may be under-reported as it <b>may</b> mimic decompression <b>sickness,</b> and respond to the same treatment i. e. hyperbaric oxygen...|$|R
50|$|A {{faster rate}} of {{respiration}} {{is required by}} humans and animals not regularly at high altitudes. Those familiar with altitude training know that prolonged exposure to the reduced pressures of high altitudes will produce more red blood cells to offset the lower oxygen availability.

50|$|In {{addition}} to protecting the fetus, morning <b>sickness</b> <b>may</b> also protect the mother. A pregnant woman's {{immune system is}} suppressed during pregnancy, presumably to reduce the chances of rejecting tissues of her own offspring. Because of this, animal products containing parasites and harmful bacteria can be especially dangerous to pregnant women. There is evidence that morning sickness is often triggered by animal products including meat and fish.|$|R

50|$|Antibiotics {{should only}} be used in severe cases or for certain populations with mild {{symptoms}} (elderly, immunocompromised, food service industry workers, child care workers). For Shigella-associated diarrhea, antibiotics shorten the length of infection, but they are usually avoided in mild cases because many Shigella strains are becoming resistant to common antibiotics. Furthermore, effective medications are often in short supply in developing countries, which carry {{the majority of the}} disease burden from Shigella. Antidiarrheal agents <b>may</b> worsen the <b>sickness,</b> and should be avoided.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} visual-vestibular {{interactions}} as these occur when viewing images, and <b>may</b> cause motion <b>sickness.</b> Some basic vestibular matters fundamental to motion sickness are highlighted, {{such as the}} observation that people without functioning inner ears do not get sick from motion, including visual motion. Furthermore, the subjective vertical mismatch theory is described, and its corollaries regarding visual motion. A theoretical framework including visual-vestibular interactions is presented. This framework provides opportunities for studying, understanding, describing, and predicting visually induced motion sickness...|$|R

5000|$|The low partial {{pressure}} of gases, principally nitrogen (N2) but including all other gases, may cause dissolved {{gases in the}} bloodstream to precipitate out, resulting in gas embolism, or bubbles in the bloodstream.

Symptoms may include the early symptoms of [...] "the bends"—tiredness, forgetfulness, headache, stroke, thrombosis, and subcutaneous itching—but rarely the full symptoms thereof. Decompression <b>sickness</b> <b>may</b> also be controlled by a full-pressure suit as for altitude sickness.|$|R
2500|$|Later texts {{like the}} Neijing Tu and Xiuzhen Tu depict the [...] "inner landscape" [...] {{of the human}} body as a {{microcosm}} of the universe, which helps neidan mediators visualize their personal internal spirits.
