40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{have revealed}} the eccentricity and inclination distributions of close-in super-Earths. These distributions {{have the potential}} to constrain their formation processes. In the in-situ formation scenario, the eccentricities and inclinations of planets are determined by gravitational scattering and collisions between protoplanets on the giant impact stage. We investigate the effect of the <b>initial</b> eccentricities and <b>inclinations</b> of protoplanets on the formation of close-in super-Earths. We perform $N$-body simulations of protoplanets in gas-free disks, changing the <b>initial</b> eccentricities and <b>inclinations</b> systematically. We find that while the eccentricities of protoplanets are well relaxed through their evolution, the inclinations are not. When the <b>initial</b> <b>inclinations</b> are small, they are not generally pumped up since scattering is less effective and collisions occur immediately after orbital crossing. On the other hand, when the <b>initial</b> <b>inclinations</b> are large, they tend to be kept large since collisional damping is less effective. Not only the resultant inclinations of planets, but also their number, eccentricities, angular momentum deficit, and orbital separations are affected by the <b>initial</b> <b>inclinations</b> of protoplanets.

40|$|In this Letter, we {{give new}} {{constraints}} on planet migration. They were obtained {{under the assumption}} that Saturn’s current obliquity is due to a capture in resonance with Neptune’s ascending node. If planet migration is too fast, then Saturn crosses the resonance without being captured and it keeps a small obliquity. This scenario thus gives a lower limit on the migration time scale τ. We found that this boundary depends strongly on Neptune’s <b>initial</b> <b>inclination.</b> For two different migration types, we found that τ should be at least greater than 7 Myr.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the alignment processes of spinning black holes and their surrounding warped accretion disks in {{a frame of}} {{two different types of}} feeding at the outer boundaries. We consider (1) fixed flows in which gas is continually fed with a preferred angular momentum, and (2) free flows {{in which there is no}} gas supply and the disks diffuse freely at their outer edges. As expected, we find that for the cases of fixed flows the black hole disk systems always end up aligning on timescales of several 1 e 6 yr, irrespective of the <b>initial</b> <b>inclinations.</b> If the <b>initial</b> <b>inclination</b> angles are larger than pi/ 2, the black hole accretion transits from retrograde to prograde fashion, and the accreted mass onto the black holes during these two phases is comparable. On the other hand, for the cases of free flows, both alignments and anti-alignments can occur, depending on the <b>initial</b> <b>inclinations</b> and the ratios of the angular momentum of the disks to that of the black holes. In such cases, the disks will be consumed within timescales of 1 e 6 yr by black holes accreting at the Eddington limit. We propose that there is a close connection between the black hole spin and the lifetime for which the feeding persists, which determines the observable episodic lifetimes of active galactic nuclei. We conclude that careful inclusion of the disk feeding at the outer boundaries is crucial for modeling the evolution of the black hole spin.

The system represents a benchmark case for the interplay of the Kozai mechanism, general relativistic and tidal forces. From our simulations, there is only a small boundary in <b>initial</b> <b>inclinations</b> and <b>initial</b> semi-major axes that result in the migration via the Kozai mechanism of alpha Cen B b to its present location. Inside this boundary, the planet orbit is stable for up to 1 Gyr against the Kozai mechanism, and outside this boundary the planet collides with alpha Cen B or is ejected. In our three simulations where the planet migrates in towards the star via the Kozai mechanism, the final inclination is 46 - 53 degrees relative to the AB orbital plane, lower than the <b>initial</b> <b>inclination</b> of 75 degrees in each case. We discuss inclination constraints from the formation of alpha Cen B b in situ at its present location, migration in a proto-planetary disk, or migration in resonance with additional planets. We conclude that alpha Cen B b probably has a mass of less than 2. 7 M_earth, implying a likely terrestrial composition warranting future confirmation. Comment: ApJ, accepte...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved iterative nonlinear calibration method in the gravitational field for both low-grade and high-grade triaxial accelerometers. This calibration method assumes the probability density {{function of a}} Gaussian distribution for the raw outputs of triaxial accelerometers. A nonlinear criterion function is derived as the maximum likelihood estimation for the calibration parameters and inclination vectors, which is solved by the iterative estimation. First, the calibration parameters, including the scale factors, misalignments, biases and squared coefficients are estimated by the linear least squares method according to the multi-position raw outputs of triaxial accelerometers and the <b>initial</b> <b>inclination</b> vectors. Second, the sequence quadric program method is utilized to solve the nonlinear constrained optimization to update the inclination vectors according to the estimated calibration parameters and raw outputs of the triaxial accelerometers. The <b>initial</b> <b>inclination</b> vectors are supplied by normalizing raw outputs of triaxial accelerometers at different positions without any a priori knowledge. To overcome the imperfections of models, the optimal observation scheme is designed according to some maximum sensitivity principle.

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{gravitational}} capture {{in the framework of}} the Sun-Uranus-particle system. Part of the space of initial conditions is systematically explored, and the duration of temporary gravitational capture is measured. The location and size of different capture-time regions are given in terms of diagrams of initial semimajor axis versus eccentricity. The other initial orbital elements - inclination (i), longitude of the node (Ω), argument of pericenter (ω), and time of pericenter passage (τ) - are first taken to be zero. Then we investigate the cases with ω = 90 °, 180 °, and 270 °. We also present a sample of results for Ω = 90 °, considering the cases i = 60 °, 120 °, 150 °, and 180 °.

Randomly constructed samples of massless particles {{are set to}} migrate radially from outside the orbit of a Jupiter-mass planet at different drift rates totalling more than 1. 6 × 10 ^ 6 numerical simulations. Slower drift rates reduce overall capture probability especially for prograde orbits and enhance capture at specific <b>initial</b> <b>inclinations</b> of high order resonances such as the outer 1 : 5, 1 : 4, 1 : 3, 2 : 5, 3 : 7 and 5 : 7. Global capture is reduced with increasing eccentricity at all inclinations as high order resonances capture more particles that are subsequently lost by disruptive close encounters with the planet. The relative efficiency of retrograde resonances at long-lived capture with respect to prograde resonances is explained by the reduced effect of planet encounters as such events occur with a shorter duration and a higher relative velocity for retrograde motion. Capture in the coorbital 1 : 1 resonance is marginally affected by the radial drift rate except for nearly coplanar retrograde eccentric orbits whose capture likelihood is increased significantly with slower drift rates.
