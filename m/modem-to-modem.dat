25|$|A digital Stratego CD-ROM was {{introduced}} by Hasbro Interactive in 1998 for Windows 95/98. It included all the games of Ultimate Stratego as well as classic Stratego, and {{was designed to be}} used over an LAN, <b>modem-to-modem,</b> or over the internet.|$|E
500|$|Jet Moto also {{utilizes}} {{a magnetic}} grappling system. Pressing the assigned button near a red energy pole creates a magnetic attraction between the player's bike and the pole, allowing riders to traverse tight turns and clear large chasms {{that would otherwise}} be impossible. [...] In addition to the grapple system players are given four boosts per lap, which provide a temporary burst of speed. The PlayStation version of the game allows for two player splitscreen multiplayer, however no AI racers are present, which limits the competitors to two. A cheat code would allow two human players to race with the entire field. [...] The PC version allows for fourteen players over an IPX network, Internet TCP/IP and <b>modem-to-modem</b> connections.|$|E

50|$|In an {{interesting}} full circle, direct dial-up support for Synchronet is available again as Rob Swindell wrote a modem to telnet gateway program (SEXPOTS) for this purpose. Using this program, SysOps can once again offer their BBSes via direct <b>modem-to-modem</b> connections.|$|E
50|$|DLE {{is never}} used in {{standard}} <b>modem-to-modem</b> data modes {{such as the}} one used for dial-up Internet access, at least not by the modem itself. In these modes, DLE is passed over the line just like any other character. DLE (and DLE-escaped messages) are only used by a modem for fax and voice applications, when it is specifically placed in a fax or voice mode.|$|E
50|$|Duke Nukem 3D {{features}} multiplayer. At {{the time}} of its release, Internet-based gaming was just beginning. Duke Nukem 3D did not support the TCP/IP client/server model, instead based its network play on the IPX LAN, modem or serial cable. Duke Nukem 3D players often either battled <b>modem-to-modem,</b> using the IPX network utility Kali or the Total Entertainment Network (TEN) online pay service. Kali allowed users to connect to a chat room to host and join games. Duke Nukem 3D was one of the more popular games on TEN prior to the closure of the network in 1999. The game was also supported by DWANGO.|$|E

40|$|The WHOI Micro-Modem is a compact, {{low-power}} acoustic transceiver {{that can}} provide both acoustic telemetry and navigation. Its size and versatility make it ideal for integration in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The modem supports the use of both broadband and narrowband transponders for long baseline navigation systems, has a <b>modem-to-modem</b> ranging capability, and can be configured to provide synchronous oneway ranging, when integrated with a precision clock. This paper gives {{an overview of the}} different navigation systems supported by the Micromodem and presents the results from field tests conducted on the SeaBED AUV in deployments in Greece, the Bluefin AUV, and whale localizations in the Stellwagen Bank Marine Sanctuary...|$|E
