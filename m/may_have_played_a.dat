5|$|Following a Viking raid in 994, a {{peace treaty}} was agreed {{with one of the}} raiders, Olaf Tryggvason. Besides {{receiving}} danegeld, Olaf converted to Christianity and undertook never to raid or fight the English again. Ælfheah <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> part in the treaty negotiations, and it is certain that he confirmed Olaf in his new faith.|$|E
5|$|Grünschloß speculates the UFO-contact {{narratives}} <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> {{role in the}} group's {{development of}} space opera, specifically citing the resemblance of Hubbard's description of life in Xenu's time to statements by George Adamski, a UFO contactee of the 1950s. Rothstein notes the group's teachings about extraterrestrials varies greatly {{from most of the}} UFO movement, particularly in Hubbard's descriptions of demonic characters.|$|E
5|$|Large thin flat mineralized plates {{have been}} found next to the ribs' sides. Their {{function}} is unknown; they <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> role in respiration. However, muscle scars or other indications of attachment have not been found for the plates, which argues against a respiratory function. Recent histological study of layered plates from a probable subadult indicates {{that they may have}} started as cartilage and became bone as the animal aged. Such plates are known from several other ornithopods and their cerapodan relatives.|$|E

5|$|The {{existence}} of Reuleaux polygons shows that diameter measurements alone cannot verify that an object has a circular cross-section. Overlooking this fact <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> {{role in the}} Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, as the roundness of sections of the rocket in that launch was tested only by measuring different diameters, and off-round shapes may cause unusually high stresses {{that could have been}} one of the factors causing the disaster.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} by, Matilda {{directed}} {{more of her}} attention to the Cistercian order, This order was very fashionable in England and Normandy during the period, and was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, a figure of particular importance to Matilda. She had close links to the Cistercian Mortemer Abbey in Normandy, and drew on the house for a supply of monks when she supported the foundation of nearby La Valasse. She encouraged the Cistercians to build at Mortemer on a grand scale, with guest houses to accommodate a range of visitors of all ranks, and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> part in selecting the paintings for the monastic chapels.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the highly}} {{specialized}} mandibles, {{scientists believe that}} the ants exhibited habits no longer seen in extant ants. The highly movable head suggests that mobility was an important factor for them (probably for feeding behavior), and the rugose projections <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> major role in nest excavation because the mandibles would have prevented such activity. Zigrasimecia most likely interacted with the extinct ant genus Gerontoformica through conflict and probably shared some of their ecological niches. The mandibles of these ants were probably used for mechanical interactions with food, and they may also have served as traps for potential arthropod prey such as mites and small flies. Zigrasimecia was possibly a generalist predator.|$|E

40|$|It is now {{admitted}} that very large impacts <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>an</b> {{important role in}} the accretion of the terrestrial planets. The size-frequency distribution of these impacts fits the formal definition of a catastrophic process: the mass and momentum added by a rare large impact is larger than that added by all the more frequent small impacts combined. The effects of such large impacts on the thermal states of growing planets is discussed. At a later stage of planetary evolution, the smaller impacts during late heavy bombardment <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>an</b> important role in stripping the original gaseous atmospheres of the planets and in segregating condensible substances from volatile ones...|$|R

5|$|During {{the summer}} before the 1953 season, the Browns' {{original}} owners sold the team for a then-unheard-of $600,000. The buyers were a group of prominent Cleveland men: Dave R. Jones, a businessman and former Cleveland Indians director, Ellis Ryan, a former Indians president, Homer Marshman, an attorney, and Saul Silberman, owner of the Randall Park race track. McBride had been called in 1950 {{to testify before the}} Kefauver Committee, a congressional body investigating organized crime, which partly exposed his ties to mafia figures but did not result in any charges. While McBride never said so, the Kefauver hearings and the growing public association between him and the mafia <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> role in his decision to get out of football.|$|E
5|$|In June 2004, Williamson {{was murdered}} in his {{apartment}} by an acquaintance, Dwight Hayden, whom he had been aiding with financial handouts. Police believed that Hayden's motive was robbery, although J-FLAG also suggested that homophobia <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> part in the killing. Hayden was subsequently {{sentenced to life in}} prison. Upon learning of the murder, a crowd assembled in New Kingston to celebrate Williamson's death, chanting homophobic slogans and lyrics. Conversely, the Jamaican LGBT community held a secret memorial for him, while protests against the killing were held by LGBT rights groups in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Keynes's {{prescription}} for strong public investment had ties to {{his interest in}} uncertainty. Keynes had given a unique perspective on statistical inference in A Treatise on Probability, written in 1921, years before his major economic works. Keynes thought strong public investment and fiscal policy would counter the negative impacts the uncertainty of economic fluctuations can have on the economy. While Keynes's successors {{paid little attention to}} the probabilistic parts of his work, uncertainty <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> central part in the investment and liquidity-preference aspects of General Theory.|$|E
50|$|Ecological {{research}} {{is also being}} done looking at the interaction between plumage colors and B. licheniformis activity, and the consequences thereof. Feather degrading bacteria <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>an</b> {{important role in the}} evolution of molting, and patterns in feather coloration (Gloger's Rule).|$|R

50|$|André Bareau {{considers}} {{the origin of}} the Mahāyāna tradition to be in the early Mahāsāṃghika schools, and cites the Bahuśrutīyas and Prajñaptivādins as sub-sects of the Mahāsāṃghika that <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>an</b> important role in bridging the flow of Mahayana teachings between the northern and southern Mahāsāṃghika traditions.|$|R
5|$|Sexual {{selection}} <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> {{role in the}} {{diversification of}} skin color and pattern in poison frogs. With female preferences in play, male coloration could evolve rapidly. Sexual selection is influenced by many things. The parental investment may {{shed some light on}} the evolution of coloration in relation to female choice. In Oophaga pumilio, the female provides care for the offspring for several weeks whereas the males provides care for a few days, implying a strong female preference. Sexual selection increases phenotypic variation drastically. In populations of O. pumilio that participated in sexual selection, the phenotypic polymorphism was evident. The lack of sexual dimorphism in some dendrobatid populations however suggests that sexual selection is not a valid explanation.|$|E
5|$|State {{repression}} (including {{the infamous}} 1894 French lois scélérates) of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations {{may have contributed}} to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French socialist movement, into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune, the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies, favoured individualist political expression and acts.|$|E
5|$|After the {{evacuation}} signal was given, the buses began {{to pick up}} passengers and head to the DAO Compound. The system worked so efficiently that the buses {{were able to make}} three return journeys rather than the expected one. The biggest problem occurred when the ARVN guarding the main gate at Tan Son Nhut refused to allow the last convoy of buses into the DAO Compound at about 17:45. As this was happening, a firefight between two ARVN units broke out and caught the rearmost buses in the crossfire, disabling two of the vehicles. Eventually the ARVN commander controlling the gates agreed to permit the remaining buses to enter the compound. General Carey's threat to use the AH-1J SeaCobra helicopter gunships flying overhead <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> role in the ARVN commander's decision.|$|E

5|$|Ankylosaurus is {{a member}} of the family Ankylosauridae, and its closest {{relatives}} appear to be Anodontosaurus and Euoplocephalus. Ankylosaurus is thought to have been a slow moving animal, able to make quick movements when necessary. Its broad muzzle indicates it was a non-selective browser. Sinuses and nasal chambers in the snout may have been for heat and water balance, or <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> role in vocalization. The tail club is thought to have been used in defense against predators or in intraspecific combat. Ankylosaurus has been found in the Hell Creek, Lance, and Scollard formations, but appears to have been rare in its environment. Although it lived alongside a nodosaurid ankylosaur, their ranges and ecological niches do not appear to have overlapped, and Ankylosaurus may have inhabited upland areas. Ankylosaurus also lived alongside dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, and Edmontosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Before {{setting off}} for Paris, Carrouges first visited Argentan {{to meet with}} Count Pierre and there announcing his {{intention}} of continuing to the capital. What followed was a sequence of events which will forever remain unclear but which would have a dramatic effect {{on the lives of}} all concerned. What is certain is that Carrouges encountered his rival Jacques Le Gris at the court of Count Pierre and words were exchanged, although what was said is unknown. In contrast to his bankrupt rival, Le Gris had not been on the Scottish expedition and had grown wealthier in Carrouges' absence. Le Gris also had a reputation as a fierce and strong soldier in addition to that of a notorious womaniser, a reputation that <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> part in the allegations which followed.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Gaozong {{supported}} settling a {{peace treaty}} with the Jurchens and sought {{to rein in the}} assertiveness of the military. The military expeditions of Yue Fei and other generals were an obstacle to peace negotiations. The government weakened the military by rewarding Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, and Zhang Jun (1086–1154) with titles that relieved them of their command over the Song armies. Han Shizhong, a critic of the treaty, retired. Yue Fei also announced his resignation as an act of protest. In 1141 Qin Hui had him imprisoned for insubordination. Charged with treason, Yue Fei was poisoned in jail on Qin's orders in early 1142. Jurchen diplomatic pressure during the peace talks <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> role, but Qin Hui's alleged collusion with the Jin has never been proven.|$|E
50|$|Early Mecoptera <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>an</b> {{important}} role in pollinating extinct species of gymnosperm before the evolution of other insect pollinators such as the bees. Adults of modern species are overwhelmingly predators or consumers of dead organisms; {{they are the first}} insects to arrive at a cadaver, making them useful in forensic entomology.|$|R

5|$|Fox's {{family lived}} in various cities and towns across Canada because of his father's career. The family finally moved to the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby, British Columbia, when his father retired in 1971. His father died on January 6, 1990, from a heart attack. Fox {{attended}} Burnaby Central Secondary School, and now has a theatre named for him in Burnaby South Secondary. At age 15, Fox starred in the Canadian television series Leo and Me, produced by the CBC, and in 1979, at age 18, he moved to Los Angeles to further his acting career. Shortly after his marriage, he decided {{to move back to}} Vancouver. Fox is one of four members of the Leo and Me cast and crew who eventually developed Parkinson's disease in mid-life, an unusually high number that led to some investigation as to whether an environmental factor <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> role.|$|E
5|$|Frazee {{sold the}} rights to Babe Ruth for $100,000, the largest sum ever paid for a {{baseball}} player. The deal also involved a $350,000 loan from Ruppert to Frazee, secured by a mortgage on Fenway Park. Once it was agreed, Frazee informed Barrow, who, stunned, told the owner {{that he was getting}} the worse end of the bargain. Cynics have suggested that Barrow <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> larger role in the Ruth sale, as less than a year after, he became the Yankee general manager, and in the following years made a number of purchases of Red Sox players from Frazee. The $100,000 price included $25,000 in cash, and notes for the same amount due November 1 in 1920, 1921, and 1922; Ruppert and Huston assisted Frazee in selling the notes to banks for immediate cash.|$|E
5|$|Higham theorises that Gregory {{believed}} {{that the end of}} the world was imminent, and that he was destined to be a major part of God's plan for the apocalypse. His belief was rooted in the idea that the world would go through six ages, and that he was living at the end of the sixth age, a notion that <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> part in Gregory's decision to dispatch the mission. Gregory not only targeted the British with his missionary efforts, but he also supported other missionary endeavours, encouraging bishops and kings to work together for the conversion of non-Christians within their territories. He urged the conversion of the heretical Arians in Italy and elsewhere, as well as the conversion of Jews. Also pagans in Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica were the subject of letters to officials, urging their conversion.|$|E

30|$|The final {{earthworm}} weight {{gains were}} possibly {{due to the}} availability of adequate nutrients in the vermibeds for the worms, particularly inside the mixture of waste with GM. Moreover, GM also <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>an</b> important role in earthworm weight gain by providing more nutrients.

50|$|Further {{evidence}} suggests that gesture and language are linked. In humans, manually gesturing {{has an effect on}} concurrent vocalizations, thus creating certain natural vocal associations of manual efforts. Chimpanzees move their mouths when performing fine motor tasks. These mechanisms <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>an</b> evolutionary role in enabling the development of intentional vocal communication as a supplement to gestural communication. Voice modulation could have been prompted by preexisting manual actions.|$|R
