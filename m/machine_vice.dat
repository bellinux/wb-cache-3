40|$|The {{additive}} manufacturing of metal parts represents a promising process {{that could be}} used alongside traditional manufacturing methods. The research scenario in this field is still largely unexplored, as far as the technological solutions adopted to integrate different processes are concerned and in terms of environmental and economic impact assessment. In this article, an electron beam melting (EBM) process and a machining process have been analyzed and compared using a cradle-to-grave life cycle-based approach. The production of components made of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy has been assumed as a case study. The proposed methodology is able to account for all of the main factors of influence on energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions when the component shape is varied. The results prove that, besides the direct energy intensity of the manufacturing processes, the impacts related to material usage are usually dominant. Therefore, when complex geometries have to be manufactured, the {{additive manufacturing}} approach could be the best strategy, if it enables a larger amount of material savings than conventional <b>machining.</b> <b>Vice</b> versa, when a small amount of material has to be machined off, the high energy intensity of an EBM process has a negative effect on the performance of the process...|$|R

40|$|Links are {{established}} between three widely used modeling frameworks for reactive systems: the ioco theory of Tretmans, the interface automata of De Alfaro and Henzinger, and Mealy machines. It is shown that, by exploiting these links, any tool for active learning of Mealy machines {{can be used}} for learning I/O automata that are deterministic and output determined. The main idea is to place a transducer in between the I/O automata teacher and the Mealy machine learner, which translates concepts from the world of I/O automata to the world of Mealy <b>machines,</b> and <b>vice</b> versa. The transducer comes equipped with an interface automaton that allows us to focus the learning process on those parts of the behavior that can effectively be tested and/or are of particular interest.

The results indicated that present-day machines are considered to surpass humans in respect to detection, perception, and long-term memory while Fitts argued that the opposite held true.

40|$|AbstractEquality sets of finite sets of homomorphisms are {{studied as}} part of formal {{language}} theory. Some particular equality sets, called Mergek(k-COPY), are investigated. These languages are combinatorially difficult, and are full semiAFL generators of the recursively enumerable sets, and are semiAFL generators of the class MULTI-RESET, provided k ⩾ 3. To accomplish this characterization, equality sets are related to multihead and multitape Post machines operating in real time. A Post machine has a one-way input tape and Post tapes as storage tapes, which in the multihead version are scanned {{from left to right}} by a write head and several read heads. By simulating Post machines by multiple reset <b>machines,</b> and <b>vice</b> versa, several new characterisations of the class MULTI-RESET are obtained, and it is shown that for multihead and multitape Post machines linear time is no more powerful than real time, and two Post tapes or, alternatively, three heads on one Post tape are as powerful as any finite number of heads or tapes. Finally, some complexity bounds for equality sets and Post machines are discussed...|$|R

Most computational problems that are efficient in practice have efficient algorithms on multitape Turing <b>machines,</b> and <b>vice</b> versa. We survey the literature on relationships among time and space classes defined using multitape Turing machines. We discuss the result of Paul, Hopcroft and Valiant that deterministic space T is more powerful than deterministic time T {{and the result of}} Paul, Pippenger, Szemeredi and Trotter that nondeterministic linear time is more powerful than deterministic linear time. We also discuss techniques to simulate Turing machines by Turing machines with different sets of resources, and techniques to diagonalize against complexity classes, with specific reference to the recent research by Fortnow et al. on time-space tradeoffs for the Satisfiability problem. Finally, we mention a few results on models other than Turing machines and resources other than time and space, and list the major open problems in this area.

50|$|Another anti-Machine {{group was}} the Alabama Student Party (ASP), {{which was founded}} by SGA Senators Fred L. Gibson, Jr. and O. Kevin Vincent in 1985.

Orr's fraternity was also the fraternity of the then SGA President, George Harris. Control of ASP was then subsequently retaken by independents later in the year, and it then played a pivotal role as a force for independents in upcoming elections.

40|$|The {{human body}} is a highly {{familiar}} and socially very important object. Does this mean that the human body has a special status with respect to visual attention? In the current paper we tested whether people in natural scenes attract attention and "pop out" or, alternatively, are at least searched for more efficiently than targets of another category (machines). Observers in our study searched a visual array for dynamic or static scenes containing humans amidst scenes containing <b>machines</b> and <b>vice</b> versa. The arrays consisted of 2, 4, 6 or 8 scenes arranged in a circular array, with targets being present or absent. Search times increased with set size for dynamic and static human and machine targets, arguing against pop out. However, search for human targets was more efficient than for machine targets as indicated by shallower search slopes for human targets. Eye tracking further revealed that observers made more first fixations to human than to machine targets and that their on-target fixation durations were shorter for human compared to machine targets. In summary, our results suggest that searching for people in natural scenes is more efficient than searching for other categories even though people do not pop out...|$|R
5000|$|EIAJ-1 was a {{standard}} for video tape recorders (VTRs) developed by the Electronic Industries Association of Japan with the cooperation and assistance of several Japanese electronics manufacturers in 1969. It was the first standardized format for industrial/non-broadcast VTRs using a Helical scan system employing open reel tape. Previously, each manufacturer of machines in this market used a different proprietary format, with differing tape speeds, scanner drum diameters, bias frequencies, tracking head placement, and so on, although most used 1/2" [...] wide tape. As a result, video tapes recorded on one make and/or model of VTR could only be interchanged with other machines using that specific format, hampering compatibility. For example, a reel of tape recorded on a Panasonic machine would not play on a Sony <b>machine,</b> and <b>vice</b> versa. The EIAJ-1 standard ended this incompatibility, giving those manufacturers {{a standard}}ized format, interchangeable with almost all VTRs subsequently brought to market around that time.

5000|$|Autonomation: In any {{contemporary}} setting, {{every one}} uses either machines or software {{to do any}} work. Yet, this automated work still requires specific human judgments to be done right.

Autonomation is the practice of progressively imparting human judgement to a system so that it self-monitors and stops and calls a human when it feels it went wrong, just as a desktop computer will flag a virus alert if it feels under attack. Autonomation is essential to separate people from machines and not have humans doing <b>machine</b> work and <b>vice</b> versa.
