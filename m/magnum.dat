5|$|<b>Magnum</b> {{was awarded}} the ACE Roller Coaster Landmark award on June 21, 2004. <b>Magnum</b> has been repainted once in its history. The {{original}} track color was scarlet red, but the park started painting <b>Magnum</b> Molly orange in 2005. The job was completed in 2006. Cedar Point celebrated Magnum's 20th anniversary on opening day in 2009 with a ceremony and an appearance by Ron Toomer, its designer. A new entrance sign was also introduced.|$|E

5|$|He {{returns to}} Gastown and learns Scrotus' {{location}} from Scab. Max and Chumbucket find Scrotus driving around the Purgatory Flatlands an area {{far away from}} the Great White and use the <b>Magnum</b> Opus to crash the Land Mover, which is pushed {{to the edge of a}} cliff. Max wants to push the Mover off the cliff with the <b>Magnum</b> Opus but is opposed by Chumbucket, who considers himself the car's protector. Ignoring Chumbucket, he rams the Mover at full speed; Chumbucket dies, and the Land Mover and <b>Magnum</b> Opus are destroyed. Scrotus escapes with the Interceptor, Max's car at the start of the game, and challenges him. Max wins the battle, pulling the chainsaw blade out of Scrotus' head and killing him. The game ends with Max entering the Interceptor and placing a picture of his family on the dashboard before he leaves for parts unknown.|$|E

50|$|Champagne {{is mostly}} {{fermented}} in two sizes of bottles, standard bottles (750 millilitres) and <b>magnums</b> (1.5 litres). In general, <b>magnums</b> {{are thought to}} be higher quality, as there is less oxygen in the bottle, and the volume-to-surface area ratio favours the creation of appropriately-sized bubbles. However, there is no hard evidence for this view. Other bottle sizes, mostly named for Biblical figures, are generally filled with Champagne that has been fermented in standard bottles or <b>magnums.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Saber <b>Magnums</b> (Seibā Magunamu) is a {{combination}} of the Input <b>Magnums</b> and Pulsabers. It can fire a powerful beam of energy in the Maxim Beam Mode (Makishimu Bīmu Mōdo). The Maxim Boiling Water mode was used in Episode 26 in a finishing strike led by G Stag.|$|R
5|$|Mad Max is a post-apocalyptic action-adventure game {{emphasizing}} vehicular combat, {{in which}} the player is the eponymous Mad Max (Bren Foster). According to its publisher, up to 60 percent of the game focuses on driving. Some weapons and tools, including flamethrowers and turbo boosts, are mounted directly onto the <b>Magnum</b> Opus, while others, such as a grappling hook and sniper rifle, are {{used in conjunction with}} the vehicle by Chumbucket, Max's assistant, or Max himself. Max's <b>Magnum</b> Opus, with its V8 engine and powerful ramming ability, can destroy enemies' vehicles and weaponry. When simultaneously driving and aiming, the game changes to slow motion to allow the player to toggle between targets. Although Mad Max primarily uses a third-person perspective, the player can switch to first-person view when fighting enemies while driving the <b>Magnum</b> Opus. Chumbucket repairs the car when instructed to do so or when the player exits.|$|E
5|$|<b>Magnum</b> XL-200 {{has three}} white-and-black trains. Each train has red, black or blue {{striping}} at the front. Each train has six cars; riders are arranged two-across in three rows {{for a total}} of 36 riders per train. <b>Magnum</b> was the first coaster in which Arrow Dynamics used its Hypercoaster trains, which were subsequently installed on dozens of other new rides. Riders are secured by a single lap bar and a seat belt.|$|E
5|$|<b>Magnum</b> XL-200 was {{announced}} on August 16, 1988, and construction began shortly thereafter. Following its completion in 1989, Kinzel {{was one of}} the first people to ride the coaster, boarding the train after one test cycle. It officially opened to the public on May 6, 1989 as the world's tallest, fastest and steepest complete-circuit roller coaster. It was measured for the Guinness Book of World Records on June 2. Cedar Point set a record attendance in 1989, due in part to the introduction of the <b>Magnum.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Champagne {{is mostly}} {{fermented}} in two sizes of bottles, standard bottles (750 millilitres) and <b>magnums</b> (1.5 litres). In general, <b>magnums</b> {{are thought to}} be higher quality, as there is less oxygen in the bottle, and the volume-to-surface area ratio favours the creation of appropriately-sized bubbles. However, there is no hard evidence for this view. Other bottle sizes, mostly named for Biblical figures, are generally filled with Champagne that has been fermented in standard bottles or <b>magnums.</b> Gosset still bottles its Grande Réserve in jeroboam from the beginning of its second fermentation.|$|R
50|$|These tracks {{originally}} {{appeared on}} <b>Magnum's</b> 1993 compilation Archive.|$|R
5|$|The Privy Council {{is one of}} {{the four}} {{principal}} councils of the sovereign. The other three are the courts of law, the Commune Concilium (Common Council, or Parliament) and the <b>Magnum</b> Concilium (Great Council, or the assembly of all the Peers of the Realm). All are still in existence, or at least have never been formally abolished, but the <b>Magnum</b> Concilium has not been summoned since 1640 and was considered defunct even then.|$|E
5|$|Chief Wiggum, P.I. is {{a parody}} of police-dramas, such as Miami Vice, <b>Magnum,</b> P.I. and Starsky and Hutch. Skinner emulates Don Johnson from Miami Vice in order to look scruffier. The {{character}} of Big Daddy is based on Dr. John, who comes from New Orleans. The chef in the restaurant resembles Paul Prudhomme.|$|E
5|$|<b>Magnum</b> XL-200 {{has been}} the target of false rumors since 1998 {{claiming}} the structure was sinking due to unstable ground. The rumors supposedly started as an April Fools Day joke in an Ohio newspaper, but quickly spread via the Internet. Cedar Point quickly denounced such rumors.|$|E

In spite of this, the previous serious of ballad-oriented recordings served in helping increase Coltrane's legacy and influence on romantic jazz.|$|E
5|$|When <b>Magnum</b> XL-200 opened, it used pads {{similar to}} those still in use on Gemini. Shortly after its debut, however, these up-stop plates were {{replaced}} with more traditional up-stop wheels that keep the train from flying off its rails.|$|E
