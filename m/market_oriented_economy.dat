40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relevance}} of institutional differences in the way knowledge determines productivity {{for a set of}} 21 OECD countries {{in the second half of}} the XXth century. The relationship between TFP and knowledge related variables is reconsidered after controlling for a new set of institutional variables tailored to represent the post WWII institutions: the Welfare State and international trade and capital flows liberalization. We estimate the impact of innovation variables over productivity during the Golden Age as compared to the whole period 1953 - 2007, after controlling by these specific institutional variables. Additionally, we distinguish the particular impact of these relationships for five groups of countries following Amable (2006) classification of different kinds of capitalism. Our results suggest institutions determine the response of TFP to the knowledge variables and that the resulting elasticities are higher during the Golden Age. We find that there are not significant differences between the different groups and the <b>market</b> <b>oriented</b> <b>economies</b> with regard to the elasticity of TFP to the indoor innovation, with the exception of Japan. However, the results suggest that in Anglo-Saxon <b>market</b> <b>oriented</b> <b>economies,</b> international spillovers of technology have a higher impact on TFP. Additionally, in continental and Mediterranean European countries and Japan, TFP is more sensitive to human capital accumulation than in the market-oriented economies (the US and the UK) ...|$|R

Studies {{have shown that the}} presence of foreign direct investment has the potential to reduce air pollution. Foreign direct investment can be beneficial to China’s environment as the foreign companies bring more efficient technology which could improve productivity and energy efficiency. China progressed in its <b>market</b> <b>oriented</b> <b>economy</b> as this market oriented reform improved electricity generation efficiency. In addition, cleaner technology helps China’s environment. Further, there is an openness of trade, which can impact the environment and has been studied. The results found that international trade would raise income, promote consumer spending on environmentally friendly goods and curb emissions as trade openness brings more technology through from developed countries which help the environment.|$|E

The United States escalated the conflict with very heavy military spending. After a series of short-lived leaders, Michael Gorbachev {{came to power in}} the Kremlin and began a policy of glasnost and perestroika, designed to revive the stagnating Soviet economy. European satellites grew increasingly independent, led by Poland, and in 1989 they all expelled the Communist leadership. East Germany merged into West Germany, with Moscow's approval. At the end of 1991, the Soviet Union itself was dissolved into non-communist independent states. Many communist parties around the world either collapsed, or became independent non-communist entities. However, China, North Korea, Laos, Vietnam, and Cuba maintained communist regimes. China after 1980 adopted a <b>market</b> <b>oriented</b> <b>economy</b> that welcomed large-scale trade and friendly relations with United States.|$|E

Control of mergers {{is one of the}} cornerstones of competition law. Competition is an important attribute of the <b>market</b> <b>oriented</b> <b>economies</b> all over the world. Since it is not capable of self-regulation it is necessary to set limits for the behavior of the subjects that are taking part in this competition. These limits are set by competition law. The topic is divided into three chapters. The first chapter contains definition of the term competition, in the second there are described basic terms common to all areas of competition law, while {{at the end of this}} chapter there is a description of these areas. In the last chapter focus is on control of concentrations itself in the ambit of Czech law. The aim of this work is to describe merger control as it is provided by Act No. 143 / 2001 on Protection of Competition (ZOHS).
