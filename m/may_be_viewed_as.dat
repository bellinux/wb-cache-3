5|$|Points {{and lines}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> special cases of circles; a point can be {{considered}} as a circle of infinitely small radius, and a line may be thought of an infinitely large circle whose center is also at infinity. From this perspective, the general Apollonius problem is that of constructing circles tangent to three given circles. The nine other cases involving points and lines <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> limiting cases of the general problem. These limiting cases often have fewer solutions than the general problem; for example, the replacement of a given circle by a given point halves the number of solutions, since a point can be construed as an infinitesimal circle that is either internally or externally tangent.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{distinction}} between when a player is in character, meaning they are actively representing their character, and when the player is out-of-character, meaning they are being themselves. Some LARPs encourage players to stay consistently in character except in emergencies, while others accept players being out-of-character at times. In a LARP, it is usually assumed that players are speaking and acting in character unless otherwise noted, which {{is the opposite of}} normal practice in tabletop role-playing games. Character knowledge is usually considered to be separate from player knowledge, and acting upon information a character would not know <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> cheating.|$|E

5|$|Electric {{potential}} is a scalar quantity, that is, {{it has only}} magnitude and not direction. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> analogous to height: just as a released object will fall through a difference in heights caused by a gravitational field, so a charge will 'fall' across the voltage caused by an electric field. As relief maps show contour lines marking points of equal height, a set of lines marking points of equal potential (known as equipotentials) may be drawn around an electrostatically charged object. The equipotentials cross all lines of force at right angles. They must also lie parallel to a conductor's surface, otherwise this would produce a force that will move the charge carriers to even {{the potential of the}} surface.|$|E
5|$|String {{theory is}} a {{theoretical}} framework that attempts to reconcile gravity and quantum mechanics. In string theory, the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. In a given version of string theory, {{there is only one}} kind of string, which may look like a small loop or segment of ordinary string, and it can vibrate in different ways. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In this way, all of the different elementary particles <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> vibrating strings. One of the vibrational states of a string gives rise to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force.|$|E

25|$|Another {{point of}} view, which {{turns out to}} be very useful to analyze the algorithm, is that row {{reduction}} produces a matrix decomposition of the original matrix. The elementary row operations <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> the multiplication on the left of the original matrix by elementary matrices. Alternatively, a sequence of elementary operations that reduces a single row <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> multiplication by a Frobenius matrix. Then {{the first part of the}} algorithm computes an LU decomposition, while the second part writes the original matrix as the product of a uniquely determined invertible matrix and a uniquely determined reduced row echelon matrix.|$|E
