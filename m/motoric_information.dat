50|$|Farah’s {{early work}} {{focused on the}} neural bases of vision and memory. In her 1990 book, Visual Agnosia: Disorders of Object Recognition and What They Tell Us about Normal Vision (MIT Press), she framed many of the {{questions}} about visual recognition that the next two decades of cognitive neuroscience research addressed. These questions include whether the human brain uses a general-purpose pattern recognition system for all classes of visual object or whether there is specialization for face recognition and/or printed word recognition, and whether semantic memory knowledge is organized in the brain by category (e.g., living vs nonliving things) or modality (e.g. visual vs <b>motoric</b> <b>information).</b> Her research revealed a striking degree of division of labor, with specialized systems for a various categories of stimuli and types of information, and was summarized in The Cognitive Neuroscience of Vision (Wiley-Blackwell, 2000) and in the second edition of Visual Agnosia (MIT Press, 2004).|$|E
40|$|In this paper, studies {{concerned}} with the vividness of imagery are reviewed to elucidate the characteristics of vivid imagery, the mechanisms responsible for the vividness of imagery, and the factors that affect those mechanisms. From this review, the following characteristics of imagery can be identified: (a) imagery vividness can be defined {{by the amount of}} information in the image, and more perceptual information is in vivid than in dim imagery; (b) information structure in long-term memory (LTM) consists of meaning, affective information, perceptual information, and <b>motoric</b> <b>information,</b> and those components are interconnected; (c) imagery is generated in the image construction stages using perceptual information; (d) a mechanism called the Suppressor controls the channel capacity, or the flow of perceptual information from LTM to the image construction stages; (e) the degree of this suppression is affected by the emotional value of imagery computed on the basis of affective information stored in LTM; (f) <b>motoric</b> <b>information</b> in LTM also influences vividness by acting on the image construction stages. Given these characteristics, we propose a model of imagery processes in order to explain how a certain level of vividness is established for the visual mental image. Finally, some neural correlates of the model are described based on results from our latest fMRI studies, and problems remaining for further development of the model are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} of programme contents adoption {{was conducted on}} the sample of 256 tested pupils (82 male pupils of the first-grade, 74 male pupils of the second-grade and 100 male pupils of the third-grade) of primary schools. The four variables were applied by which the efficiency of programme contents realization has been evaluated. Measurement of adoption <b>motoric</b> <b>information</b> was conducted according to the current curriculum for subject of physical education in primary schools-they were graded by marks 1 to 5 with five degrees of gradation. The results were statistically evaluated and tabulated. Results were expressed by percentage frequent analyse. According to the results, male pupils of the third-grade showed better results than male pupils of the first and second-grade of primary school...|$|E
40|$|One of the “problems” that is {{currently}} present in physical culture in particular {{is the issue of}} relationship between updating – innovations of technology of expert-pedagogical work in all its constitutive forms: physical education, sport, sports recreation etc. Motoric learning in educational process is the polygon of innovations both for the teachers – coaches and students, athletes and those who are involved in sports as recreation. The best evidence to this are the controversial attitudes as well as agreements of the leading psychological theories that analyse the issue of learning within two groups: theory of linking and cognitive theory. The present research focuses on such attitudes that, thanks to their updatedness, contribute to understanding of the problem of transfer of knowledge and motoric skills in the way that does not result with their mutual exclusion but also through narrowing of their problem approach on to typical phases of <b>motoric</b> processing of <b>information</b> that strengthen, namely weaken the established “open loop” (Sheffield), “closed loop” (Adams) and “pattern” (Schmidt) systems vie “attention”, “retention”, “motivation” and other elements of cognitive processing. Opening up of the issue on application of new but also tested ideas of motoric learning enriches the work on feed back information of subjects of educational process with a clear objective to strengthen the individual and incapacitate it to face its own capacities, knowledge and habits with »motoric problems« in order to start the journey towards the resolving of the same...|$|R
40|$|There are a {{wide range}} of visual tools that can be used within a {{structured}} approach to support learning and teaching. Visual tools include mind maps, concept maps and various other diagrams that can each be used {{in a variety of ways}} to aid, develop and represent learning. Caviglioli et al (2002) state that we all have schemas formed by our external and internal experiences. By representing schema externally they can be added to, adapted and changed, particular aspects can be scrutinised in detail and explored for further analysis. Visual tools can be used by students to develop maps which enables them to absorb and understand information. The utilisation of visual tools also enables students to identify and externalise their models of understanding. Through this process, problem-solving approaches to learning and teaching can be promoted. The visual tool is therefore used as a vehicle which enables students to develop conclusions after working through a problem. Buzan (1995) states that, traditionally, education has been built on the structural patterns of speech, which are in the main linear in nature. However he argues that the human brain does not simply think in a linear fashion. What is not accounted for is the multi-modal nature of the human 'holographic' brain. Vision is a symbolic process and as images are inputted into the brain any number of representations of it can be formed. Visual tools can be used in order to assist students to assimilate their findings/conclusions and provide visual explanations of these representations. Visuals tools may be used by students within educational institutions in a variety of ways to support them in both the planning and presentation aspects of their work. Within the practice based learning environment, students may use visual tools to develop their skills of problem-solving and decision making. The tools also enable students to develop their time management and organisational skills. All of which contribute to their overall professional development and growth as they work towards becoming an effective practitioner delivering high quality nursing care. In addition, nurse lecturers can effectively utilise visual tools to support the planning of lectures tutorials and practice learning opportunities. Once experienced in the use of mapping and presentation of data using visual tools, healthcare professionals can further use the tools to enable them to plan their personal and professional development associated with life long learning. These tools can be used for higher-level thinking and not just the merely descriptive. In using them, analytical thinking, where a subject is rigorously examined in a logical step-by-step manner (Rose and Nicholl, 1997), can be made easier, hence the suggestion for their use to provide portfolio evidence of information and reflections. This would fit the notion of Williamon and Valentine (2002) of hierarchical organisation as a cognitive principle that applies to the encoding and retrieval of both <b>motoric</b> and symbolic <b>information.</b> There is no Visual aspect that cannot be used within these and they can be adapted and developed in however the individual wishes to do so. The use of the tools relate to the representation of levels of sophistication of information, Burton and Bodenhamer (2000) suggest that humans make representations in the forms of nominal (sorted into categories), ordinal (compared or ranked against the qualities of other representations), interval (comparison with even more detail) and ratio data (highlighting interrelationships and meaning between representations). It is by recognising the tools used to represent types and levels of data the student and facilitator can utilise them in the presentation of data and demonstrate problem-solving An original project, funded through a teaching and learning grant, resulted in the development of a teaching package to support the use of visual tools within higher education. This work was undertaken within the School of Human and Health Sciences at The University of Huddersfield, the use of these tools is now integrated within the curriculum for pre-registration nurse education. Workshops for students and staff are facilitated by the project designers to support its dissemination across the school and university. Aim of presentation: The aim of the presentation is to discuss the use of visual tools as a learning and teaching strategy within healthcare education. Objectives: 1. 	Identify the use of how visual tools can be used within healthcare education as learning and teaching strategy. 2. 	Share ideas on how these visual tools are used within the curriculum at The University of Huddersfield. 3. 	Discuss how these can be used as an assessment strategy and the development of there use within higher education to demonstrate levels of understanding and problem-solvin...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this review}} is to {{consider}} how current vocabulary training methods could be optimized by considering recent scientific insights in how the brain represents conceptual knowledge. We outline the findings from several methods of vocabulary training. In each case, we consider how taking an embodied cognition perspective could impact word learning. The evidence we review suggests that vocabulary training methods can be optimized by making a congruent link between the words to learn and one’s own perceptual and motoric experiences. In particular, we suggest that <b>motoric</b> <b>information</b> {{about the meaning of}} a word could be incorporated into more standard vocabulary training methods. Finally, we consider the impact an embodied cognitive perspective may have on other characteristics of word learning, such as individual differences in learning and variations in learning different types of words, for example words from different word classes and words in different contexts...|$|E
40|$|Centrally active antihistamines impair {{cognitive}} performance, particularly sensorimotor performance. The aim of {{the present}} study was to further elucidate the scarcely studied subprocesses involved in sensorimotor performance, which may be affected by H- 1 receptor blockade. Better knowledge about the cognitive deficits associated with histamine dysfunction can contribute to better treatment of clinical disorders in which histamine hypofunction may be a contributing factor, such as in schizophrenia. Interactions of dexchlorpheniramine with specific task manipulations in a choice reaction time task were studied. Task demands were increased at the level of sensory subprocesses by decreasing stimulus quality, and at the level of motor subprocesses by increasing response complexity. A total of 18 healthy volunteers (9 female) aged between 18 and 45 years participated in a three-way, double-blind, crossover design. Treatments were single oral doses of 4 mg dexchlorpheniramine, 1 mg lorazepam and placebo. Behavioural effects were assessed by measuring reaction times and effects on brain activity by event-related potentials. Dexchlorpheniramine significantly slowed reaction times, but did not significantly interact with task manipulations. However, it did significantly interact with stimulus quality, as measured by event-related potentials. Lorazepam slowed reaction times and interacted with perceptual manipulations, as shown by effects on reaction times. The results confirm that the histamine system is involved in sensory information processing and show that H- 1 blockade does not affect <b>motoric</b> <b>information</b> processing. Histamine hypofunction in clinical disorders may cause impaired sensory processing, which may be a drug target...|$|E
40|$|Although it {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that nouns and verbs are functionally independent linguistic entities, it is less clear whether their processing recruits different brain areas. This issue is particularly relevant for those theories of lexical semantics (and, more in general, of cognition) that suggest the embodiment of abstract concepts, i. e., based strongly on perceptual and motoric representations. This paper presents a formal meta analysis of the neuroimaging evidence on noun and verb processing {{in order to address}} this dichotomy more effectively at the anatomical level. We used a hierarchical clustering algorithm that grouped fMRI/PET activation peaks {{solely on the basis of}} spatial proximity. Cluster specificity for grammatical class was then tested on the basis of the noun verb distribution of the activation peaks included in each cluster. 32 clusters were identified: three were associated with nouns across different tasks (in the right inferior temporal gyrus, the left angular gyrus, and the left inferior parietal gyrus); one with verbs across different tasks (in the posterior part of the right middle temporal gyrus); and three showed verb specificity in some tasks and noun specificity in others (in the left and right inferior frontal gyrus and the left insula). These results do not support the popular tenets that verb processing is predominantly based in the left frontal cortex and noun processing relies specifically on temporal regions; nor do they support the idea that verb lexical semantic representations are heavily based on embodied <b>motoric</b> <b>information.</b> Our findings suggest instead that the cerebral circuits deputed to noun and verb processing lie in close spatial proximity in a wide network including frontal, parietal, and temporal regions. The data also indicate a predominant – but not exclusive – left lateralization of the network...|$|E
40|$|Gibson's (1979) {{ecological}} {{approach to}} vision and perception suggested that objects hold <b>motoric</b> <b>information</b> that is automatically perceived upon first sight. This is {{the theory of}} affordances. Subsequent research has extensively suggested that the simple viewing of an object can automatically elicit motor response codes for relevant actions. In the present PhD thesis this affordance effect hypothesis was examined under experimental conditions that allowed the properties of this effect to be identified, particularly how it is modulated under different types of vision and attention. The methodological approaches applied included measurements of response times to simple motor tasks, as well as measurements of corticospinal excitability by applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques. Participants viewed real objects (or depictions of these) associated with specific limb actions (i. e. pinching and grasping), thus allowing associations to be drawn between the physical properties of the stimuli and the recorded reaction times or TMS-induced reactions. First and foremost, behavioural and neurophysiological evidence was provided that visual objects can automatically activate motor programmes for congruent actions, even in cases {{where there is no}} need to implement these actions. Furthermore, the temporal evolution of the affordance effect was investigated under various experimental conditions. It was found that object affordances are generated soon after first viewing an object (- 300 ms), but dissipate quite rapidly after that (- 600 ms). Finally, the present studies and findings provided strong evidence that vision and attention serve a pivotal role in the generation of the affordance effect, and that variations in how an object is perceived can greatly affect the way affordances are generated. Overall, the present PhD provided experimental evidence on a highly topical field within Psychology and Neuroscience that concerns the relationship between visual perception and motor planning.
