40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify actual {{conditions}} and problems in <b>medical</b> information <b>education</b> and to propose the educational concept to be adopted in medical information. A questionnaire survey was carried out by the anonymous method in June 2008. The survey was intended for 40 radiological technology schools. The questionnaire items were as follows: (1) educational environment in <b>medical</b> information <b>education,</b> (2) content of a lecture in medical information, (3) problems in <b>medical</b> information <b>education.</b> The response rate was 55. 0 % (22 schools). Half of the responding schools had a laboratory on medical information. Seventeen schools had a <b>medical</b> information <b>education</b> facility, and out of them, approximately 50 % had an educational medical information system. The main problems of the <b>medical</b> information <b>education</b> were as follows: (a) motivation of the students is low, (b) the educational coverage and level for medical information are uncertain, (c) there are not an appropriate textbook and educational guidance. In conclusion, these findings suggest that it is necessary to have a vision of <b>medical</b> information <b>education</b> in the education of radiological technologists...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{explored}} {{differences in}} changes in medical student empathy {{in the third}} year of medical school between volunteers at JeffHOPE, a multisite medical student-run free clinic of Sidney Kimmel Medical College (SKMC), and nonvolunteers. METHOD: Volunteerism and leadership experience at JeffHOPE were documented for medical students in the Class of 2015 (n = 272) across their <b>medical</b> <b>educations.</b> Students completed the Jefferson Scale of Empathy at the beginning of medical school {{and at the end of}} the third year. Students who reported participation in other Jefferson-affiliated clinics (n = 44) were excluded from this study. Complete data were available for 188 SKMC students. RESULTS: Forty-five percent of students (n = 85) volunteered at JeffHOPE at least once during their <b>medical</b> <b>educations.</b> Fifteen percent of students (n = 48) were selected for leadership positions involving weekly clinic participation. Nonvolunteers demonstrated significant decline in empathy in medical school (P = 0. 009), while those who volunteered at JeffHOPE at least once over the course of their <b>medical</b> <b>educations</b> did not show any significant decline (P = 0. 07). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that medical students may benefit from volunteering at student-run free clinics to care for underserved populations throughout medical school...|$|R
40|$|Landmark {{reports have}} {{confirmed}} that it is within the core responsibilities of doctors to address nutrition in patient care. There are ongoing concerns that doctors receive insufficient nutrition <b>education</b> during <b>medical</b> training. This paper {{provides an overview of}} a <b>medical</b> nutrition <b>education</b> initiative at the University of Cambridge, School of Clinical Medicine, including 1) the approach to <b>medical</b> nutrition <b>education,</b> 2) evaluation of the <b>medical</b> nutrition <b>education</b> initiative, and 3) areas identified for future improvement. The initiative utilizes a vertical, spiral approach during the clinically focused years of the Cambridge undergraduate and graduate medical degrees. It is facilitated by the Nutrition Education Review Group, a group associated with the UK Need for Nutrition Education/Innovation Programme, and informed by the experiences of their previous nutrition education interventions. Three factors were identified as contributing {{to the success of the}} nutrition education initiative including the leadership and advocacy skills of the nutrition academic team, the variety of teaching modes, and the multidisciplinary approach to teaching. Opportunities for continuing improvement to the <b>medical</b> nutrition <b>education</b> initiative included a review of evaluation tools, inclusion of nutrition in assessment items, and further alignment of the Cambridge curriculum with the recommended UK <b>medical</b> nutrition <b>education</b> curriculum.

40|$|Abstract Background There {{is strong}} support for educating {{physicians}} in medical informatics, {{and the benefits of}} such education have been clearly identified. Despite this, North American medical schools do not routinely provide <b>education</b> in <b>medical</b> informatics. Methods We conducted a qualitative study to identify issues facing the introduction of medical informatics into an undergraduate medical curriculum. Nine key informants at the University of Toronto medical school were interviewed, and their responses were transcribed and analyzed to identify consistent themes. Results The field of medical informatics was not clearly understood by participants. There was, however, {{strong support for}} <b>medical</b> informatics <b>education,</b> and the benefits of such education were consistently identified. In the curriculum we examined, <b>medical</b> informatics <b>education</b> was delivered informally and inconsistently through mainly optional activities. Issues facing the introduction of <b>medical</b> informatics <b>education</b> included: an unclear understanding of the discipline; faculty and administrative detractors and, the dense nature of the existing undergraduate medical curriculum. Conclusions The identified issues may present serious obstacles to the introduction of <b>medical</b> informatics <b>education</b> into an undergraduate medicine curriculum, and we present some possible strategies for addressing these issues. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background mLearning is {{increasingly}} presented as an attractive novel educational strategy for <b>medical</b> and nursing <b>education.</b> Yet evidence base for its effectiveness or factors which influence use, success, implementation or adoption are not clear. We aim to synthesise findings from qualitative studies to {{provide insight into}} the factors (barriers and facilitators) influencing adoption, implementation and use of mobile devices for learning in <b>medical</b> and nursing <b>education.</b> The review also aims to identify factors or actions which are considered to optimise the experience and satisfaction of educators and learners in using mobile technologies for <b>medical</b> and nursing <b>education,</b> and to identify strategies for improving mLearning interventions for <b>medical</b> and nursing <b>education.</b> Methods A systematic search will be conducted across a range of databases for studies describing or evaluating the experiences, barriers, facilitators, and factors pertaining to the use of mLearning for <b>medical</b> and nursing <b>education.</b> The framework synthesis approach will be used to organise and bring different components of the results together. The confidence in the qualitative review findings will be assessed using the CERQual approach. Discussion This study will contribute to the planning and design of effective mLearning, and the development of mLearning guidelines for <b>medical</b> and nursing <b>education...</b>|$|R
