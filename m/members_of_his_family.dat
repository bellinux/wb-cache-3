5|$|According to Theissen and Merz, it {{is common}} for {{extraordinary}} charismatic leaders, such as Jesus, to come into conflict with their ordinary families. In Mark, Jesus' family comes to get him, fearing that he is mad (Mark 3:20–34), and this account is likely historical because early Christians would not have invented it. After Jesus' death, many <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> joined the Christian movement. Jesus' brother James became a leader of the Jerusalem Church.|$|E
5|$|Allingham {{celebrated his}} 112th {{birthday}} with <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> at RAF Cranwell, Lincolnshire as {{the guest of}} honour at a luncheon at the college. During the day the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight performed a flypast which was followed by an aerobatic display from two Tutor aircraft.

5|$|Although Chaplin {{remained}} {{politically active}} {{in the years following}} the failure of Monsieur Verdoux, his next film, about a forgotten vaudeville comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London, was devoid of political themes. Limelight was heavily autobiographical, alluding not only to Chaplin's childhood and the lives of his parents, but also to his loss of popularity in the United States. The cast included various <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family,</b> including his five oldest children and his half-brother, Wheeler Dryden.|$|E

5|$|Christ Church, {{although}} a larger building than St John's, {{is the daughter}} church in Radyr. Designed by the Llandaff diocesan surveyor George Halliday, the nave was ready for use at Easter 1904 and the chancel and tower were completed in November 1910. Also in 1910 John Taylor & Co of Loughborough cast a ring of eight bells for the tower. Lieutenant Colonel Fisher paid for the bells, and each bell is inscribed {{with the names of}} <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{also built}} the Temple of Caesar, the Baths of Agrippa, and the Forum of Augustus with its Temple of Mars Ultor. Other {{projects}} were either encouraged by him, {{such as the}} Theatre of Balbus, and Agrippa's construction of the Pantheon, or funded by him {{in the name of}} others, often relations (e.g. Portico of Octavia, Theatre of Marcellus). Even his Mausoleum of Augustus was built before his death to house <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family.</b>|$|E

5|$|Some {{converts}} were sincerely devout {{in their}} Christian faith. Cisneros {{said that some}} converts chose to die as martyrs when demanded to recant by the Muslim rebels in Granada.

The crown later paid him compensation for his losses.|$|E
5|$|What {{became of}} Hasekura is unknown and {{accounts}} {{of his last}} years are numerous. Contemporary Christian commentators could rely only on hearsay, with some rumours stating that he abandoned Christianity, others that he was martyred for his faith, and others that he practised Christianity in secret. The fate of his descendants and servants, who were later executed for being Christians, suggests that Hasekura remained strongly Christian and transmitted his faith to the <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family.</b>|$|E
5|$|At Sutton Hoo (near Woodbridge, in Suffolk) is {{the site}} of two 6th-7th century Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, where it is {{believed}} that members of the Eorpwald's dynasty were entombed under large earth mounds. Several East Anglian kings, including Eorpwald, have been suggested as possible candidates for the occupant of the burial site under Mound 1, discovered in 1939. Martin Carver has speculated that historians could use regal lists and other sources of information to identify the occupants, whilst acknowledging that no material evidence exists to support the theory that Eorpwald or other <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> are buried there. He has used Eorpwald's relationship as the son of Rædwald to place him in either Mound 1 or 2.|$|E
60|$|This {{agent of}} Providence had been irritated and mortified by Mrs. Cleve's opposition, and hardly {{knew how to}} handle an adversary who failed to {{perceive}} that a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> gave <b>of</b> necessity more than he received. But he had obtained information on his return to Paris which exalted the uses of humility. Euphemia's fortune, wonderful to say, was greater than its fame, and in view of such a prize, even a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> could afford to take a snubbing.|$|R

5|$|Due to the band's slow progress, Shields {{contemplated}} relocating to New York City, where <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> {{were living}} at the time. However, Creation Records co-founder Joe Foster had decided to establish his own record label, Kaleidoscope Sound and persuaded My Bloody Valentine to record and release an EP. The New Record by My Bloody Valentine, produced by Foster, was released in October 1986 and was a minor success, peaking at number 22 on the UK Indie Chart upon its release. On {{the strength of the}} release, the band began performing more frequent shows, later developing a small following and travelling outside London for live performances, supporting and opening for bands such as The Membranes.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton is {{not known}} to have ever owned slaves, {{although}} <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> were slave owners. At {{the time of her}} death, Hamilton's mother owned two slaves named Christian and Ajax, and she had written a will leaving them to her sons; however, due to their illegitimacy, Hamilton and his brother were held ineligible to inherit her property, and never took ownership of the slaves. Later, as a youth in St. Croix, Hamilton worked for a company trading in commodities that included slaves. During his career, Hamilton did occasionally purchase or sell slaves for others as their legal representative, and one of Hamilton's grandsons interpreted some of these journal entries as being purchases for himself.|$|E
5|$|Hemming singles out the conquests of England by Cnut and William the Conqueror {{as being}} {{especially}} damaging. He {{claims that the}} work only covers the lost estates that were assigned to support the cathedral chapter, but as he describes the loss of several manors that were listed in Domesday Book as belonging to the bishop, the work probably covers more than the author claims. It also contains a listing of amounts paid to King William to regain items the king had taken from the diocese. Worcester paid over 45.5 marks of gold to recover their belongings. Others singled out in the work as significant plunderers of Worcester's lands included Leofric, Earl of Mercia, and other <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family.</b>|$|E

5|$|In June 1627, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham led an {{expedition}} to the island of Île de Ré to support the Huguenots besieged in La Rochelle by King Louis XIII of France. With no standing army, Buckingham's forces were largely volunteers and mercenaries. Since public opinion in England (particularly among extreme Protestants) supported the Huguenots, a number of well connected gentry came forward. The volunteers to join Buckingham included Temple, his elder brother John and other <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family.</b> The expedition to the Isle of Ré, was a disaster and altogether, Buckingham lost more than 5,000 men in the campaign out of a force of 7,000. Among those who died was Temple's brother.|$|E
5|$|Khurshid (Middle Persian: , Khōrshēd; Tabari/, Spāhbed Khōrshīd 'General Khorshid'; 734–761), erroneously {{designated}} Khurshid II {{by earlier}} scholars, {{was the last}} Dabuyid ispahbadh of Tabaristan. He succeeded to the throne at an early age, and was supervised by his uncle as regent {{until he reached the}} age of fourteen. Khurshid tried to assert his independence from his vassalage to the Caliphate, supported various rebellions and maintained diplomatic contacts with Tang China. Finally, the Abbasids conquered his country in 759–760, and captured most <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family.</b> Khurshid fled to Daylam, where he ended his life.|$|E
5|$|Lacking {{sufficient}} funds himself, Brown {{convinced the}} financier Jack C.

Sanders then began to have doubts about selling the company, as some <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> were against it. The group acquired the company in 1964 for US$2 million (around US$15 million in 2013).
