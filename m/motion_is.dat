5|$|So-called superluminal <b>motion</b> <b>is</b> seen {{in certain}} astronomical objects, {{such as the}} {{relativistic}} jets of radio galaxies and quasars. However, these jets are not moving at speeds {{in excess of the}} speed of light: the apparent superluminal <b>motion</b> <b>is</b> a projection effect caused by objects moving near the speed of light and approaching Earth at a small angle to the line of sight: since the light which was emitted when the jet was farther away took longer to reach the Earth, the time between two successive observations corresponds to a longer time between the instants at which the light rays were emitted.|$|E
50|$|<b>Motions</b> can <b>be</b> {{divided into}} direct and {{indirect}} motions.Direct, proper or rigid <b>motions</b> <b>are</b> <b>motions</b> like translations and rotations that preserve the orientation of a chiral shape.Indirect, or inproper <b>motions</b> <b>are</b> <b>motions</b> like reflections, glide reflections and Improper rotations that invert the orientation of a chiral shape.Some geometers define motion {{in such a way}} that only direct <b>motions</b> <b>are</b> <b>motions.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{dust devil}} is a strong, well-formed, and {{relatively}} long-lived whirlwind, ranging from small (half a metre wide {{and a few}} metres tall) to large (more than 10 metres wide and more than 1000 metres tall).

5|$|An {{animal that}} is {{commonly}} {{thought to be}} dazzle-patterned is the zebra. The bold stripes of the zebra have been claimed to be disruptive camouflage, background-blending and countershading. After many years in which {{the purpose of the}} coloration was disputed, an experimental study by Tim Caro suggested in 2012 that the pattern reduces the attractiveness of stationary models to biting flies such as horseflies and tsetse flies. However, a simulation study by Martin How and Johannes Zanker in 2014 suggests that when moving, the stripes may confuse observers, such as mammalian predators and biting insects, by two visual illusions: the wagon-wheel effect, where the perceived <b>motion</b> <b>is</b> inverted, and the barberpole illusion, where the perceived <b>motion</b> <b>is</b> in a wrong direction.|$|E
5|$|In Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī's (973–1048) Shadows, {{non-uniform}} <b>motion</b> <b>is</b> {{described as}} the result of acceleration. Ibn-Sina's theory of mayl tried to relate the velocity and weight of a moving object, a precursor of the concept of momentum. Aristotle's theory of motion stated that a constant force produces a uniform motion; Abu'l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī (c. 1080 – 1164/5) disagreed, arguing that velocity and acceleration are two different things, and that force is proportional to acceleration, not to velocity.|$|E

50|$|The {{films were}} then {{projected}} frame-by-frame and analysed and classified in to a predetermined format of Basic Motions. These Basic <b>Motions</b> <b>were</b> Reach, Grasp, Move, Position, Release, etc. A <b>motion</b> <b>was</b> taken to begin {{on the frame}} in which the hand first started performing the <b>motion</b> and <b>was</b> taken to end on the frame in which the <b>motion</b> <b>was</b> completed.

5|$|The {{concept of}} the conatus, as used in Baruch Spinoza's psychology, is derived from sources both ancient and medieval. Spinoza reformulates {{principles}} that the Stoics, Cicero, Laertius, and especially Hobbes and Descartes developed.

5|$|Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash (Italian: Dinamismo di un cane al guinzaglio), {{sometimes}} called Dog on a Leash or Leash in <b>Motion,</b> <b>is</b> a 1912 painting by Italian Futurist painter Giacomo Balla. It {{was influenced by}} the artist's fascination with chronophotograpic studies of animals in motion. It is considered one of his best-known works, {{and one of the most}} important works in Futurism, though it received mixed critical reviews. The painting has been in the collection of the Albright–Knox Art Gallery since 1984.|$|E
5|$|In general, <b>motion</b> <b>is</b> {{classified}} {{according to}} the anatomical plane it occurs in. Flexion and extension are examples of angular motions, in which two axes of a joint are brought closer together or moved further apart. Rotational motion may occur at other joints, for example the shoulder, and are described as internal or external. Other terms, such as elevation and depression, describe movement above or below the horizontal plane. Many anatomical terms derive from Latin terms with the same meaning.|$|E

5|$|In {{pictures}} {{taken by the}} Hubble Space Telescope in 1999, the motion of M87's jet was measured at four to six times the speed of light. This <b>motion</b> <b>is</b> presumably an optical illusion caused by the relativistic velocity of the jet, and not true superluminal motion. However, detection of such motion supports the theory that quasars, BL Lacertae objects and radio galaxies may all be the same phenomenon, known as active galaxies, viewed from different perspectives. It has been proposed M87 could actually be a BL Lacertae object (with a low-luminosity nucleus compared with the brightness of its host galaxy) seen from an unfavorable angle to appreciate the properties {{of that kind of}} galaxy.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of a driven wheel, a torque must be applied to {{generate}} the locomotive force. In human technology, this torque is generally provided by a motor, of which there are many types, including electric, piston-driven, turbine-driven, pneumatic, and hydraulic. (Torque may also be provided by human power, as in {{the case of}} a bicycle.) In animals, <b>motion</b> <b>is</b> typically achieved by the use of skeletal muscles, which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food. Because these muscles are attached to both of the components that must move relative to each other, they are not capable of directly driving a wheel. In addition, large animals cannot produce high accelerations, as inertia increases rapidly with body size.|$|E

5|$|In {{this new}} role, he invented the Shive wave machine (also {{known as the}} Shive wave {{generator}}). The wave generator illustrates wave motion using a series of steel rods joined by a thin torsion wire which transmits energy from one rod to the next. The high moment of inertia of each rod ensures the wave takes several seconds to traverse the entire series of rods, making the dynamics easily visible. The <b>motion</b> <b>is</b> analogous to high-frequency waves that are invisible to the human eye, such as electromagnetic waves on a transmission line. The wave generator could illustrate wave reflection, standing waves, resonance, partial reflection, and impedance matching. Shive made two educational films in which he demonstrated the machine, Simple Waves and Similarities in Wave Behavior, and wrote a book with the same name as the latter.|$|E
5|$|Love in <b>Motion</b> <b>is</b> {{the fourth}} studio album by New Zealand singer-songwriter Anika Moa. The album's {{underlying}} theme is love. Moa's civil partner, Azaria Universe, was her biggest influence when writing the album. With Love in Motion, Moa {{moved from the}} folk and country pop influences of In Swings the Tide to a pop rock sound. The album was released by EMI Records internationally on 12 March 2010, with releases in Moa's home country and Australia following on 5 April and 10 September, respectively. Moa toured Westfield malls {{the week of the}} album's release, and a concert tour followed in May and June 2010.|$|E
5|$|Most {{forms of}} {{camouflage}} are ineffective when the camouflaged animal or object moves, because the <b>motion</b> <b>is</b> easily {{seen by the}} observing predator, prey or enemy. However, insects such as hoverflies and dragonflies use motion camouflage: the hoverflies to approach possible mates, and the dragonflies to approach rivals when defending territories. Motion camouflage is achieved by moving so as to stay on a straight line between the target and a fixed point in the landscape; the pursuer thus appears not to move, but only to loom larger in the target's field of vision. The same technique {{can be used for}} military purposes, for example by missiles to minimise their risk of detection by the enemy. However, missile engineers, and animals such as bats, use the technique primarily for its efficiency rather than camouflage.|$|E
