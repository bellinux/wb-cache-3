500|$|Massa denied responsibility, {{and agreed}} with the stewards' decision: [...] "I think there's little to say: I had already entered the turn and he hit <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind,</b> {{spinning}} me round." [...] The penalty was largely criticized in the media. GrandPrix.com called the penalty [...] "bizarre", saying that Bourdais [...] "could not just disappear". James Allen of ITV said that in light of FIA race director Charlie Whiting's announcement prior to the race, which indicated that cars exiting the pit-lane would have right of way, the penalty was [...] "ridiculous". French sporting newspaper L'Équipe criticized the stewards for their intervention, saying that both drivers held their lines and the collision was just a racing incident. Mark Blundell, who drove in Formula One for five years, called for former drivers {{to be part of}} the stewards meetings which award penalties: [...] "You can examine pieces of paper, graphs, telemetry, but you don't know what's going on in a driver's brain until you've experienced it." [...] Blundell's suggestion eventually became fact - the 2010 season introduced a system whereby a former F1 driver acted as a steward during each Grand Prix.|$|E
2500|$|Tommy Jones, {{a former}} member of the Royal Military Police special {{investigations}} branch, became well known as a guide for Western journalists and visitors to the inner German border. Although he escorted around 4,000-5,000 visitors a year along the border, he averred that he [...] "never [...] frustrated. It is important to show people this border. It is impossible to imagine it or to describe it." [...] Jones arrived in Germany in 1945 during the British advance to the Elbe in the closing months of the Second World War and remained there for the next 45 years. He joined the BFS in 1960, moved to Helmstedt in 1974 and became the head of the BFS in 1983, by which time it had only four personnel left. In January 1990, he was awarded an MBE and retired to become a Chelsea Pensioner. His departure was noted not just by the West Germans with whom he had worked for so long, but by the East German border guards as well; as he put it, [...] "For 16 years at Helmstedt, the East German border guards never spoke to me... All they did was take pictures of <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> bushes. When the border was opened, suddenly the East German guards decided they wanted to try and shake my hand. But I didn't feel like shaking their hands." ...|$|E

60|$|This time I was {{pitted against}} men--the spear {{told me that}} all too plainly--but {{so long as they}} didn't take <b>me</b> unawares or <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> I had little fear of them.|$|R
5000|$|... 1597: In Act IV, Scene 5 of Shakespeares The Merry Wives of Windsor, Bardolph is mugged: [...] "so soon as I came beyond Eton, (cozenors) threw <b>me</b> off, <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> one of them, in a slough of mire". This {{could be}} a {{reference}} to Slough. In the same scene Cole-brooke (Colnbrook) is referenced along with Reading and Maidenhead.|$|R
60|$|Rude hands seized <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind,</b> and the doublet {{was torn}} from my back by fingers that never paused to untruss my points.|$|E

60|$|Passing of {{an evening}} I have seen his dark, grim figure flitting about {{in the shadow of}} the trees, or caught a glimpse of his hard, angular, swarthy face peering out suspiciously at <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> the bars.|$|E
60|$|Seven {{days later}} (on the 7th of May, {{that is to}} say) I was aware that I was lying in Heatherlegh's room as weak as a little child. Heatherlegh was {{watching}} <b>me</b> intently <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> the papers on his writing-table. His first words were not encouraging; but I was too far spent to be much moved by them.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{they should}} come," [...] thought the captain, as he again {{sat in the}} dark, [...] "I must not try to fight them in the passage. That would have been my best chance, but now some of them might pick <b>me</b> off <b>from</b> <b>behind.</b> No, I must fight them in this chamber. I can put {{everybody}} else in the middle apartment. Perhaps before to-morrow night it might be well to bring some of those loose rocks here and build a barricade. I wish I had thought of that before." ...|$|R
5000|$|His {{football}} career {{becomes apparent}} {{when he joined}} Makassar in Pekan Olahraga Daerah (Porda) Makassar in 1997. He scored a decisive goal that brought his team to victory and champion of the tournament. [...] "That is the most memorable grand final event for <b>me.</b> I went <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> and did some sprint and I scored with my head." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{to thank}} you for my life," [...] he said, holding out his hand to him. [...] "It would have gone hard with me if that fellow had {{attacked}} <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind.</b> I had not bargained for three of them." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{closed his}} eyes. The door opened, {{and the nurse}} entered, {{followed}} {{by a man who}} bowed gravely to me. He was still wearing a grey tweed suit and a red tie; his eyes beamed upon <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> his gold-rimmed spectacles.|$|E
60|$|Sabina Silver. Then I won't marry you, Mr. Paul, {{till you}} swear to me upon {{the book that}} you will never beat me with any stick that you could call a stick, and that you will never strike a kick on <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{man took}} out a {{handkerchief}} and mopped his forehead. He was short and stout, with a bushy brown beard, and eyes which blinked at <b>me</b> in amazement <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> his gold-rimmed spectacles. He wore a grey tweed travelling suit, and brown boots. He had exactly {{the air of a}} prosperous middle-class tradesman from the provinces.|$|R
60|$|IT was broad {{day when}} I awoke {{and found myself}} tossing at the {{south-west}} end of Treasure Island. The sun was up but was still hid <b>from</b> <b>me</b> <b>behind</b> the great bulk of the Spy-glass, which on this side descended almost to the sea in formidable cliffs.|$|R
60|$|As we {{neared the}} plaza and my {{presence}} was discovered we were immediately surrounded {{by hundreds of}} the creatures who seemed anxious to pluck <b>me</b> <b>from</b> my seat <b>behind</b> my guard.

6000|$|... ‘O!’ she cried. ‘The coward! He {{leaves me}} to bear all, {{and in the}} hour of trial he stabs <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind.</b> There is nothing in him, not respect, not love, not courage—his wife, his dignity, his throne, the honour of his father, he forgets them all!’ ...|$|E
60|$|At {{last she}} {{gave way to}} me and talked no more. Instead she looked at me--as a thing beyond her controlling, but none the less interesting--much as she had looked at <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> the skirts of Lady Drew in the Warren when we were {{children}} together.|$|E

5000|$|During {{his stay}} in politics, Debono enjoyed a troubled {{relationship}} with the press, accusing The Times of {{taking part in a}} [...] "character assassination" [...] aimed at him. He furthermore claimed in 2012 that the [...] "Prime Minister is viciously attacking <b>me</b> and others <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> paper screens like Ms Caruana Galizia's blog." [...] Caruana Galizia considers Debono a [...] "psycho" [...] and claims to support several campaigns intended to attack Debono.|$|R
5000|$|The sleigh {{spins around}} and its nose dips down towards the {{courtyard}} below, but Ludwig's mother grabs halt {{of it before}} the sleigh can fall.

5000|$|Gruesome Gertie is also infamous {{for having}} the first known {{incident}} of a failed execution by electrocution in the United States.

Let <b>me</b> breathe!" [...] <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> his leather hood. The execution was aborted, and an appeal was filed to the Supreme Court, which was denied. Francis was later successfully executed on May 9, 1947.|$|R
60|$|Leonore. I will. Forgive me, if I seem to fear thee; but thy voice sounds strangely hollow, and thine {{eyes look}} darkly on <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> this mask. Thou wilt lay it by {{when we are}} safe, and then I shall forget this foolish fear that hangs upon me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very {{much for}} the better! You were a horrid little brute. You used to terrify me. I never knew when {{you were going to}} bound out at <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> a tree or something. I {{remember}} your chasing me for miles, shrieking {{at the top of your}} voice!" ...|$|E

6000|$|And, forthwith, {{she began}} upon the first chapter; and having read five lines of this, {{she went back}} and read the title page, {{suddenly}} remembering that Mr Croft liked to begin a book at the very beginning. Miss Annie had been accustomed to read to her father, and she read aloud very well, and liked it. As she sat there, shaded by a great locust tree, which had dropped so many yellow leaves upon the grass, that, now and then, it could not help letting a little fleck of sunshine come down upon her, sometimes gilding for a moment her light-brown hair, sometimes touching {{the end of a}} crimson ribbon she wore, and again resting for a brief space on the toe of a very small boot just visible at the edge of her dress, Lawrence looked at her, and said to himself: [...] "Is it possible that this is the rather pale young girl in black, who gave <b>me</b> change <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> the desk of Mr Candy's Information Shop? I don't believe it. That young person sprang up, temporarily, and is defunct. This is some one else." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then, {{just as the}} Colonel passed within, a {{burst of}} cheering broke out, and in the mad {{scramble}} for the entrance Grace, who turned a moment to recover the cloak she dropped, was separated from her companion. He was driven forward in the thickest part of the stream of excited human beings, and fortune had signally favored <b>me.</b> Squeezing through <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> a pillar I reached her side, and grew hot with pride when she slipped her arm through mine, and we were borne forward irresistibly by the surging crowd. Once I saw Ormond vainly trying {{to make his way}} back in search of his companion, and I stood so that he could not see her. Half-way down the aisle we met an official who recognized me as a nephew of Martin Lorimer. [...] "I'll find you and the lady seats in the chancel. It will be the only good place left," [...] he said.|$|R

60|$|What {{happened}} then {{is still a}} blurred picture in my brain. I know that Cynthia was shot <b>from</b> under <b>me</b> before she had taken her leap, and we fell heavily together.
