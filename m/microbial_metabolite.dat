The reduced butyrate in CD 326 + intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) after allo-BMT resulted in decreased histone acetylation, which was restored after local administration of exogenous butyrate. Butyrate restoration improved IEC junctional integrity, decreased apoptosis and mitigated GVHD. Furthermore, alteration of the indigenous microbiota with 17 rationally selected strains of high butyrate-producing Clostridia also decreased GVHD.

40|$|The {{use of a}} high {{quercetin}} dose {{to demonstrate}} its absorption and bioavailability {{does not reflect the}} real dietary situation because quercetin glycosides are usually present in small amounts in the human diet. This study aimed to demonstrate the absorption and bioavailability of quercetin in mulberry leaves that represents a more physiologic dietary situation. Mulberry leaf ethanol extract was prepared similar to tea inftision, which is the way the tea leaves are generally prepared for consumption. Accordingly, rats were fed by oral intubation the mulberry leaf ethanol extract (15 g / rat per day) or pure rutin (135 mu g/rat per day) for 2 weeks. The control group received a similar volume of the vehicle, 10 ethanol. There was a significant increase in total antioxidant activity (TAA) in the urine and feces of the antioxidants-fed rats. Phenylacetic acid, a <b>microbial</b> <b>metabolite</b> of quercetin, was detected in the urine of the test animals, and quercetin was present in the fecal samples. By using an in situ intestinal preparation, 3 -hydroxyphenylacetic acid, another <b>microbial</b> <b>metabolite</b> of quercetin, was detected in the plasma when the duodenal segment was instilled with 2 mg of rutin. This <b>microbial</b> <b>metabolite</b> retained 50 of the TAA of quercetin.

40|$|The colonic {{microbial}} metabolism {{is an important}} source of uremic retention solutes accumulating in patients with chronic kidney disease and higher serum levels of <b>microbial</b> <b>metabolites</b> have been related to overall mortality, cardiovascular disease and progression of pre-existing renal disease. The interaction between the colonic {{microbial metabolism}} and renal function has been coined the ‘gut-kidney axis’. Although it has been well established that serum levels of microbiota derived uremic retention solutes rise in parallel with renal function decline due to diminished renal excretion, we demonstrate that variability in intestinal uptake is an equally important contributor to interindividual differences in serum levels of <b>microbial</b> <b>metabolites.</b> Higher intestinal uptake, which is a composite of intestinal generation and subsequent absorption, also independently relates to adverse outcomes in patients with renal dysfunction. Moreover, chronic kidney disease profoundly affects colonic microbial metabolism and generation of these solutes with a substantial impact of chronic kidney disease related dietary restrictions. Intestinal absorption of <b>microbial</b> <b>metabolites</b> consists of both diffusion and active transport following phase 2 metabolism. We also show that there is a clear interaction between microbial metabolism and endogenous metabolism, which is altered in patients with renal dysfunction and associates with overall mortality and cardiovascular disease. In a search for strategies targeting intestinal exposure to <b>microbial</b> <b>metabolites,</b> there appears no beneficial effect of prebiotic arabinoxylan oligosaccharides, while modulation of dietary protein intake affects generation of selected solutes. Renal transplantation substantially decreases serum levels of <b>microbial</b> <b>metabolites,</b> not only resulting from renal function recovery, but also due to an independent effect on intestinal uptake. Finally, we emphasize the relevance of solutes derived from microbial metabolism that are subjected to highly efficient tubular secretion, irrespective of protein binding characteristics. Gut barrier dysfunction and/or heightened innate immune system activation may be other factors in the causal chain between chronic kidney disease and adverse outcomes. Although our findings contribute to the appealing concept of the gut-kidney axis, further research remains necessary to search for effective measures that target this entity and, hopefully, improve morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease. status: publishe...|$|R
