[...] His teammate Nico Hülkenberg had finished the race in front of him, and said after the race: [...] "The Safety Car ended up playing into my hands, which is the little bit of luck you always need to get a good result". Speaking about the race, 14th-placed Jenson Button said: [...] "Painful, I think, is the word. I was on the harder tyre at the start but still it was just waving goodbye to everyone in front really." [...] He also stated that he believed that McLaren were more affected by the high altitude than the other teams. On his one-lap outing, Fernando Alonso explained that the problem that caused his retirement had been discovered the night before. He added: [...] "We had two possibilities, retire the car without even starting the race or try our maximum, knowing that <b>maybe</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> laps was the maximum we could achieve [...] We did one lap, for respect of the fans because they were amazing all weekend." ...|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} on PBS, Christopher Landsea said [...] "we certainly see substantial warming in the ocean and atmosphere {{over the last several}} decades on the order of a degree Fahrenheit, and I have no doubt a portion of that, at least, is due to greenhouse warming. The question is whether we're seeing any real increases in the hurricane activity." [...] He went on to say [...] "with the Atlantic hurricanes in particular, they're due to changes both in the ocean as well as the atmosphere. Just changing the ocean where it's a little bit warmer isn't sufficient." [...] As for climate change affecting hurricane strength, Landsea said that global warming theories and numerical modeling suggest only that [...] "hurricanes like Katrina and Rita may have been stronger due to global warming but <b>maybe</b> by <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> miles per hour." ...|$|R

This announcement was reported widely, most notably through Blabbermouth.net, which called Believer a [...] "much missed late 80s and early 90s technical thrash metal band." [...] In an interview, Bachman explained that he {{moved closer to the}} studio near where Joey Daub lives. Daub was working on mixing Fountain of Tears' new album and invited Bachman to help: [...] "We just got together and started playing and having fun," [...] Bachman stated, [...] "nothing serious, but the chemistry was still there and stuff started clicking.

5000|$|In 2015, Representative Polis voiced {{support for}} Title IX Standards {{that require a}} campus {{disciplinary}} process around rape allegations.

5000|$|... "And one of {{the things}} that was very {{impressive}} to me was that the photography was driving the crisis. In fact policy papers that were told to be prepared, were coming <b>maybe</b> <b>one</b> day <b>or</b> <b>two</b> days later and by that time, the situation had completely changed. So... the photography was creating a climate that was demanding that policy stay right with the photography. Now keep in mind, we were on two twelve hour shifts, but the policy-makers were only working eight to ten hours a day. So Lundahl raised the issue, maybe the policy-maker ought to be going into twelve hour shifts and then stay right with us at the centre as we were looking at the photography. Now that never occurred, but Lundahl raised the issue and later that would come up several times in crises in the future in which people did move into the centre." ...|$|R

This will be my last before I return home. Here at least there seems to me a chance of finding treasure, an {{infinitely}} better chance than any we have had, except in the gold valley. Here is a mysterious castle, of whose very existence the Spaniards seem never to have heard. It is just the place where treasure might be hidden. If it has guardians, they must be human, and also there can be but few. The urgent necessity for secrecy was so great, that it must, like all the other secrets, have been confided to a few only. <b>Maybe</b> but <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> old men are there, of whom certainly I need not be afraid. I have told you why I came here, and why I feel so anxious to find a valuable mine, or part of the lost treasures of the Incas.

5000|$|Film {{critic for}} the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert, gave the film a mixed review, writing, [...] "You would think an {{interesting}} picture could be made about Pancho Villa and the Mexican Revolution, a subject most Americans know next to nothing about. But we learn nothing except that Pancho was a romantic fellow who had a mustache and liked to have people lined up {{three in a row}} and killed with one bullet. (That scene, incidentally, got a big laugh.) Frankly, this kind of movie is beginning to get to me. You can enjoy <b>one,</b> <b>maybe,</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> <b>Or</b> you can enjoy a particularly well done shoot-em-up. But the Loop has been filled with one action-adventure after another for the last month, and if Villa Rides is not the worst, it is certainly not the best." ...|$|R
5000|$|Reflecting on his {{contribution}} to karate scholarship, Cook has said: [...] "I am deeply interested in history and I {{came to understand that}} many of the myths prevalent in karate were derived from an abysmal understanding of the history and evolution of karate.

Not really … the same myths are still heard over and over again … but <b>maybe</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> people have been pointed in the right direction." ...|$|E
5000|$|Over the years, O'Neill {{continued}} {{to work as a}} writer, producer, manager, and concert promoter. In 1996, he accepted Atlantic Records' offer to start his own band. He built the band on a foundation created by the marriage of classical and rock music and the artists he idolized (Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Queen, Yes, The Who, and Pink Floyd, and hard rock bands such as Aerosmith and Led Zeppelin and the multiple lead vocalists of the R&B groups the Temptations and the Four Tops). He brought in Oliva, Kinkel, and Pitrelli to help start the project. O'Neill has stated, [...] "My original concept was six rock operas, a trilogy about Christmas and <b>maybe</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> regular albums." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{thing that}} made the {{decision}} easy was {{that if we were}} to ship the game anyway and try to fix the problem later, some people were gonna get screwed. And that was wrong. It might not have been very many people - <b>maybe</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> But it would have bothered us the rest of our lives. Maybe not - maybe just two years. We'd be sitting around today: [...] "Damn, wonder when the next person's gonna call?" [...] It was so clear that there was one decision that led down the road of eternal damnation. The other was {{to spend a lot of}} money and do the right thing - and never make the same mistake again.|$|E
5000|$|The Chant were {{a little}} bit country, but way more rock and roll. [...] "The Chant were the jangliest, rockingest, twangiest, poppiest, psychedeliest post-punk Southern folk-rock band ever! (Okay, <b>maybe</b> there were <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> others...) Inspired by the 60s, {{informed}} by the 70s, formed in the 80s and ignored in the 90s, The Chant sparkled and roared out from a steamy SoFla punk scene to release two critically acclaimed albums, 1985's [...] "Three Sheets To The Wind" [...] and 1989's [...] "Two Car Mirage". The band relocated to Atlanta in 1986 and played shows {{up and down the east}} coast, headlining their own shows and opening for such indie luminaries as the Dream Syndicate, Jason and the Scorchers and The Swimming Pool Q's. They shared a side of a Chemical Imbalance 45 with Sonic Youth and appeared on tribute CDs to The Monkees and The Saints. They called it quits (for the first time) in 1996 after the death of their lead guitarist Gregory Dean Smalley." [...] The band reformed with the current lineup in 2011 and played a couple of mini-tours. There has recently been discussion of a reunion in honor of James [...] "Bing" [...] Johnson's 60th birthday.|$|R
500|$|The show, {{entitled}} Keeping Up With the Kardashians, premiered on October 14, 2007. The reality series {{centers around}} {{the members of the}} Kardashian-Jenner blended family, focusing on the sisters Kourtney, Kim and Khloé. Most episodes have very similar structure: the family [...] "show off their privileged lifestyle and <b>maybe</b> get into <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> minor family squabbles before ultimately wrapping things up with a monologue that reinforces the importance of family," [...] as noted by Caroline Siede of Quartz. Harriet Ryan and Adam Tschorn of the Los Angeles Times described the reality series as a: [...] "Hollywood version of The Brady Bunch -- the harmless high jinks of a loving blended family against a backdrop of wealth and famous connections". Kim Kardashian described the beginning of filming the show, [...] "When we first started , we came together as a family and said, 'If we're going to do this reality show, we're going to be 100 percent who we really are.'". She further commented on the show's authenticity by saying that the network [...] "has never once put anything out there that we haven't approved of or accepted". The series was renewed for a second season one month after its premiere due to high ratings. Seacrest described the show's success: [...] "At the heart of the seriesdespite the catfights and endless sarcasmis a family that truly loves and supports one another [...] The familiar dynamics of this family make them one Hollywood bunch that is sure to entertain." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{symmetry}} of a graph {{is measured by}} its automorphism group: the set of permutations of the vertices so that all edges and non-edges are preserved. There are natural questions which arise when considering the automorphism group {{and there are several}} interesting results in this area that are not well-known. This talk presents some of these results and <b>maybe</b> even proves <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> First, we will prove that almost all graphs have trivial automorphism group. Second, we will briefly discuss the relation of the graph automorphism and group intersection problems. Then, we will discuss Babai’s constrcution that any finite group with n elements can be represented by a graph on 2 n vertices (other than three exceptions). Finally, we will mention there exists a subgroup of Sn that is the automorphism group of no graph of size less than 1 2 (n 1 2 n). 1 Almost all graphs are rigid Before we can begin the proof of this fact, recall the Chernoff-Hoeffding bounds. Theorem 1. 1 ([DP 09]). Let X = ∑ n i= 1 Xi be a sum of identically distributed independent random variables Xi where Pr(Xi = 1) = p, Pr(Xi = 0) = q = 1 − p. Then, we have the following relative Chernoff-Hoeffding bound for all ε> 0 : Pr[X (1 + ε) np] ≤ e −npε 2 / 2 1. 1 Properties of G(n, p) Lemma 1. 2. Let ε be a function on n with ε(n) > 0. Then, the probability that G, distributed as G(n + 1, p), has all npε 2 vertices of degree deg v ∈ ((1 − ε) np, (1 + ε) np) is at least 1 − 2 (n + 1) e 2. Proof. Let Xi,j be the indicator variable for the edge {i, j} appearing in G(n + 1, p) (1 ≤ i (1 + ε) np] ≤ e −npε 2 / 2 1 Hence, Pr[deg i � ((1 − ε) np, (1 + ε) np) ] ≤ 2 e −npε 2 / 2 Thus, the probability that all vertices have degree within the requested bounds is at leas...|$|R
5000|$|In 2015, {{during a}} back-and-forth {{exchange}} before the House Education and Workforce Committee’s Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training, Polis argued for schools {{to be able}} to use lower standards of evidence when deciding to expel students accused of sexual assault by stating, [...] "If there are 10 people who have been accused, and under a reasonable likelihood standard <b>maybe</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> did it, it seems better to get rid of all 10 people." [...] Shortly after the comments, Polis said that he misspoke during the subcommittee hearing and that he committed a major gaffe during the discussion. Civil liberties and conservative sources have pointed to Polis' comments as evidence of the drive to erode due process rights with regards to answering accusations of sexual assault at U.S. colleges and universities.|$|E
5000|$|Williams is an ideas-driven author: {{the idea}} comes first. “Usually {{for me the}} trigger is an idea more than a {{character}} or a title. The Bobby Dollar book idea was ‘cold war,’ the Otherland idea was ‘river that links different virtual worlds together,’ the Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn idea was ‘after a King-Arthur-type Great King dies.’ Then they sort of find their own characters and titles. (Well, I help.)” In an interview with Heiner Wittmann for Klett-Cotta, Williams explains, “Almost every book starts out as <b>maybe</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> or three small ideas and then they kind of go into the mix and I wait.
