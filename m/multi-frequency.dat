A novel method, i. e., cubic spline interpolation method is applied in the detection of the voltage flicker envelope. The typical flicker signals, such as one or <b>multi-frequencies</b> and frequency time-varying flicker signal are selected and analyzed by this method. Simulation results indicate that this method is effective in the detection of the envelope of voltage flicker signal. Results of one or <b>multi-frequencies</b> flicker signal simulation show that, when flicker frequency is less than 15 Hz, the error of this method is quite tiny. The detection precision of this method is higher, especially in the scope of low frequencies of flicker and this method makes up for the disadvantage of square demodulation. Furthermore, results of frequency time-varying flicker signal simulation show that, the occurrence and recover time of voltage flicker signal can be accurately detected by cubic spline interpolation method...|$|R

25|$|A {{key feature}} of NMR {{is that the}} {{resonance}} frequency of a particular substance is directly proportional {{to the strength of}} the applied magnetic field. It is this feature that is exploited in imaging techniques; if a sample is placed in a non-uniform magnetic field then the resonance frequencies of the sample's nuclei depend on where in the field they are located. Since the resolution of the imaging technique depends on the magnitude of magnetic field gradient, many efforts are made to develop increased field strength, often using superconductors. The effectiveness of NMR can also be improved using hyperpolarization, and/or using two-dimensional, three-dimensional and higher-dimensional <b>multi-frequency</b> techniques.|$|E

25|$|In OFDM based {{wide area}} broadcasting, {{receivers}} {{can benefit from}} receiving signals from several spatially dispersed transmitters simultaneously, since transmitters will only destructively interfere with each other on {{a limited number of}} sub-carriers, whereas in general they will actually reinforce coverage over a wide area. This is very beneficial in many countries, as it permits the operation of national single-frequency networks (SFN), where many transmitters send the same signal simultaneously over the same channel frequency. SFNs utilise the available spectrum more effectively than conventional <b>multi-frequency</b> broadcast networks (MFN), where program content is replicated on different carrier frequencies. SFNs also result in a diversity gain in receivers situated midway between the transmitters. The coverage area is increased and the outage probability decreased in comparison to an MFN, due to increased received signal strength averaged over all sub-carriers.|$|E

2500|$|Numerical example: Analog FM {{requires}} 0.2MHz per programme. The {{frequency reuse}} factor {{in most countries}} is approximately 15, meaning that {{only one out of}} 15 transmitter sites can use the same channel frequency without problems with co-channel interference, i.e. cross-talk. [...] Assuming a total availability of 102 FM channels at a bandwidth of 0.2MHz over the Band II spectrum of 87.5 to 108.0 MHz, an average of 102/15 = 6.8 radio channels are possible on each transmitter site (plus lower-power local transmitters causing less interference). This results in a system spectral efficiency of 1 / 15 / (0.2 MHz) = 0.30 programmes/transmitter/MHz. DAB with 192 kbit/s codec requires 1.536MHz * 192 kbit/s / 1,136 kbit/s = 0.26MHz per audio programme. The frequency reuse factor for local programmes and <b>multi-frequency</b> broadcasting networks (MFN) is typically 4 or 5, resulting in 1 / 4 / (0.26MHz) = 0.96 programmes/transmitter/MHz. [...] This is 3.2 times as efficient as analog FM for local stations. For single frequency network (SFN) transmission, for example of national programmes, the channel re-use factor is 1, resulting in 1/1/0.25MHz = 3.85 programmes/transmitter/MHz, which is 12.7 times as efficient as FM for national and regional networks.|$|E
2500|$|HiPER {{differs from}} most ICF devices {{in that it}} also {{includes}} {{a second set of}} lasers for directly heating the compressed fuel. The heating pulse needs to be very short, about 10 to 20ps long, but this is too short a time for the amplifiers to work well. To solve this problem HiPER uses a technique known as chirped pulse amplification (CPA). CPA starts with a short pulse from a wide-bandwidth (<b>multi-frequency)</b> laser source, as opposed to the driver which uses a monochromatic (single-frequency) source. Light from this initial pulse is split into different colours using a pair of diffraction gratings and optical delays. This [...] "stretches" [...] the pulse into a chain several nanoseconds long. The pulse is then sent into the amplifiers as normal. When it exits the beamlines it is recombined in a similar set of gratings to produce a single very short pulse, but because the pulse now has very high power, the gratings have to be large (approx 1m) and sit in a vacuum. Additionally the individual beams must be lower in power overall; the compression side of the system uses 40 beamlines of about 5kJ each to generate a total of 200kJ, whereas the ignition side requires 24 beamlines of just under 3kJ to generate a total of 70kJ. The precise number and power of the beamlines are currently a subject of research. Frequency multiplication will also be used on the heaters, but it has not yet been decided whether to use doubling or tripling; the latter puts more power into the target, but is less efficient converting the light. As of 2007, the baseline design is based on doubling into the green.|$|E
