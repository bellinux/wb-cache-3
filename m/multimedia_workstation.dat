2500|$|Nintendo {{released}} a peripheral platform called 64DD, where [...] "DD" [...] stands for [...] "Disk Drive". Connecting {{to the expansion}} slot {{at the bottom of}} the system, the 64DD turns the Nintendo 64 console into an Internet appliance, a <b>multimedia</b> <b>workstation,</b> and an expanded gaming platform. This large peripheral allows players to play Nintendo 64 disk-based games, capture images from an external video source, and it allowed players to connect to the now-defunct Japanese Randnet online service. Not long after its limited mail-order release, the peripheral was discontinued. Only nine games were released, including the four Mario Artist games (Paint Studio, Talent Studio, Communication Kit, and Polygon Studio). Many more planned games were eventually released in cartridge format or on other game consoles. The 64DD and the accompanying Randnet online service were released only in Japan, despite always being announced for America and Europe.|$|E

An open cafeteria space features ample natural lighting and high ceilings with exposed structural components. The exposed structure is continued throughout the main gymnasium, the auxiliary gym, and the school’s central circulation spine. The state-of-the-art auditorium, with seating for 800, features a movable wall to accommodate different uses.

50|$|A {{number of}} {{modifications}} {{were made to}} circuits derived from the PA-7100LC. Prominently, the floating-point unit multiplier was modified to take up less area by halving the tree of carry-save adders that summed the partial products of the mantissa. This simplification left the latency of single precision multiplies unchanged (two cycles), but increased the latency of double precision multiplies to three cycles. The performance loss was deemed acceptable as the PA-7100LC was designed for mid-range <b>multimedia</b> <b>workstations</b> where single-precision multiplies are more prevalent. Integrated on-die to lower costs is a memory controller that supports up to 2 GB of memory and an I/O controller.|$|R

40|$|Audio {{compression}} {{has become}} one of the basic technologies of the multimedia age.

In many applications, such as the design of <b>multimedia</b> <b>workstations</b> and high quality audio transmission and storage, the goal is to achieve transparent coding of audio and speech signals at the lowest possible data rates. In other words, bandwidth cost money, therefore, the transmission and storage of information becomes costly. However, if we can use less data, both transmission and storage become cheaper.
