5|$|Among whites, gender nonconformity {{appeared}} {{to be important in}} the development of homosexuality among <b>masculine</b> homosexual women, but not among homosexual women who were not <b>masculine,</b> while adolescent homosexual involvement was important for non-masculine homosexual women but not <b>masculine</b> homosexual women. Bisexual women {{appeared to}} be more influenced by involvement in homosexual genital activities in childhood than exclusively homosexual women, but unlike exclusively homosexual women, their homosexual preference did not appear related to inability to experience heterosexual arousal in childhood. Childhood gender nonconformity appeared more significant for exclusively homosexual women than for bisexual women, and more significant for women who had been in psychotherapy than for women who had not.|$|E
5|$|Among {{both the}} Maguindanao and the Maranao, the agung embodies {{all that is}} <b>masculine</b> and thus the agung is {{traditionally}} considered a <b>masculine</b> instrument. To be considered a good player, one must possess strength, stamina (playing extremely fast tempos with no mistakes) and endurance. Players must also exhibit improvisation skills for different patterns to be considered as having quality musicianship—lest the audience considers the patterns played repetitions and mundane.|$|E

5|$|Old Norse Þórr, Old English ðunor, Old High German Donar, Old Saxon thunar, and Old Frisian thuner are {{cognates}} {{within the}} Germanic language branch, descending from the Proto-Germanic <b>masculine</b> noun *þunraz 'thunder'.|$|E
5|$|Shaktism's {{focus on}} the Divine Feminine does not imply a {{rejection}} of <b>masculine.</b> It rejects male-female, soul-body, transcendent-immanent dualism, considering nature as divine. Devi {{is considered to be}} the cosmos itself – she is the embodiment of energy, matter and soul, the motivating force behind all action and existence in the material universe. Yet in Shaktism, states C. MacKenzie Brown, the <b>masculine</b> and the feminine are aspects of the divine, transcendent reality. In Hindu iconography, the cosmic dynamic of masculine-feminine interdependence and equivalence, is expressed in the half-Shakti, half-Shiva deity known as Ardhanari.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, in the second-singular, {{inherited}} *-ta -ti {{competed with}} lengthened *-tā -tī for <b>masculine</b> and feminine forms. The expected {{result would be}} -t or -tā for <b>masculine,</b> -t or -tī for feminine, and in fact both variants of both forms {{are found in the}} Bible (with -h marking the long -ā and -y marking the long -ī). The situation appears to have been quite fluid for several centuries, with -t and -tā/tī forms found in competition both in writing and in speech (cf. the Secunda (Hexapla) of Origen, which records both pronunciations, although quite often in disagreement with the written form as passed down to us). Ultimately, writing stabilized on the shorter -t for both genders, while speech choose feminine -t but <b>masculine</b> tā. This is the reason for the unexpected qamatz vowel written under the final letter of such words.|$|E
5|$|The Modern English noun Valhalla {{derives from}} Old Norse Valhöll, a {{compound}} noun {{composed of two}} elements: the <b>masculine</b> noun valr 'the slain' and the feminine noun höll 'hall'. Valr has cognates in other Germanic languages such as Old English wæl 'the slain, slaughter, carnage', Old Saxon wal-dād 'murder', Old High German 'battlefield, blood bath'. All of these forms descend from the Proto-Germanic <b>masculine</b> noun *walaz. Among related Old Norse concepts, valr also appears as the first element of the nouns valkyrja 'chooser of the slain, valkyrie' and Valfreyja, one of the goddess Freyja's several names.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} shared {{association}} with skiing {{and the fact}} that both place names referring to Ullr and Skaði appear most frequently in Sweden, some scholars have proposed a particular connection between the two gods. On the other hand, Skaði may potentially be a <b>masculine</b> form and, as a result, some scholars have theorized that Skaði may have originally been a male deity.|$|E
5|$|Early Old Swedish was {{markedly}} {{different from the}} modern language in {{that it had a}} more complex case structure and also retained the original Germanic three-gender system. Nouns, adjectives, pronouns and certain numerals were inflected in four cases; besides the extant nominative, there were also the genitive (later possessive), dative and accusative. The gender system resembled that of modern German, having <b>masculine,</b> feminine and neuter genders. The <b>masculine</b> and feminine genders were later merged into a common gender with the definite suffix -en and the definite article den, in contrast with the neuter gender equivalents -et and det. The verb system was also more complex: it included subjunctive and imperative moods and verbs were conjugated according to person as well as number. By the 16th century, the case and gender systems of the colloquial spoken language and the profane literature had been largely reduced to the two cases and two genders of modern Swedish.|$|E
5|$|Heyer {{frequently}} {{highlights the}} heroine's many <b>masculine</b> qualities, {{which include a}} fierce independence and a disregard for social mores. Modern literary critics have noted {{that the relationship between}} the protagonists is modelled on those of the latter 20th century, offering companionship and allowing both parties to retain a level of independence. The heroine's unwillingness to conform attracts the hero, rather than repels him.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Jake's troubled masculinity, Romero represents an ideal <b>masculine</b> identity grounded in self-assurance, bravery, competence, and uprightness. The Davidsons note that Brett is attracted to Romero for these reasons, and they speculate that Jake might {{be trying to}} undermine Romero's masculinity by bringing Brett to him and thus diminishing his ideal stature.|$|E
5|$|Israel {{provides}} a tantalising {{link between the}} spheres of <b>masculine</b> camaraderie of a conventional royal court and the more rarefied, scholarly atmosphere that Æthelstan may have liked both his contemporaries and posterity {{to think he was}} keen to promote.|$|E
5|$|Madonna's {{body to be}} {{female and}} not <b>masculine.</b> Although the areas are {{separated}} by a wall, Spears and Madonna sense their presences through extrasensory perception and dance in synchronicity. Julie Andsager in Sex in consumer culture (2006) noted that the video hints at a same-sex relationship between the two.|$|E
5|$|Manning's father spent {{weeks in}} late 2007 {{asking her to}} {{consider}} joining the Army. Hoping to gain a college education through the G.I. Bill, and perhaps to study for a PhD in physics, she enlisted in September that year. She told her Army supervisor later that she had also hoped joining such a <b>masculine</b> environment would resolve her gender identity disorder.|$|E
5|$|On {{the death}} of Lord Sempill in 1934, both the barony and the baronetcy passed to William, the eldest child. Forbes {{inherited}} a farming estate at Brux, Aberdeenshire of about , and took to the new lifestyle with gusto, adopting a broad Doric accent and taking to wearing a <b>masculine</b> kilt.|$|E
5|$|Shelley {{uses the}} {{historical}} novel {{to comment on}} gender relations; for example, Valperga is a feminist version of Scott's masculinist genre. Introducing women into the story who {{are not part of}} the historical record, Shelley uses their narratives to question established theological and political institutions. Shelley sets the male protagonist's compulsive greed for conquest in opposition to a female alternative: reason and sensibility. In Perkin Warbeck, Shelley's other historical novel, Lady Gordon stands for the values of friendship, domesticity, and equality. Through her, Shelley offers a feminine alternative to the <b>masculine</b> power politics that destroy the male characters. The novel provides a more inclusive historical narrative to challenge the one which usually relates only <b>masculine</b> events.|$|E
5|$|The possessive determiners (analogous to English my, his, etc.) {{are used}} to {{indicate}} the possessor of the noun they determine. They mark the person and number of the possessor, and are inflected {{to agree with the}} noun they are attached in number and case. While the English language distinguishes between <b>masculine</b> and feminine singular possessors (his vs. her), late Quenya generally does not.|$|E
5|$|To appease {{those who}} {{considered}} her sex {{to be the}} most serious obstacle, Maria Theresa assumed <b>masculine</b> titles. Thus, in nomenclature, Maria Theresa was archduke and king; normally, however, she was styled as queen. No 18th-century commentary saw this crossing of gendered titles as inappropriate or impossible.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft's feminist critics {{charged that}} the <b>masculine</b> role for women that she envisioned—one {{designed}} for the public sphere but which women could not perform in the public sphere—left women without a specific social position. They saw it as ultimately confining and limiting—as offering women more {{in the way of}} education without a real way to use it.|$|E
5|$|After then {{considering}} a path into the NBA Development League, Owumi {{signed with the}} French club AL Roche-la-Molière of the Nationale <b>Masculine</b> 1 (NM1) for the 2009–10 season. He was encouraged to join due to the higher salary with AL Roche. A member of the team's starting lineup, he averaged 17.2 points and 6.0 rebounds and won league MVP accolades although his team finished with a poor record. During the season, he was benched without pay for multiple games for missing practice.|$|E
5|$|All the {{jewellery}} in the hoard is gold, and all gold {{items in}} the hoard, other than coins, are jewellery. None of the jewellery is unequivocally <b>masculine,</b> although several pieces, like the rings, might have been worn by either gender. There is one body chain, six necklaces, three rings, and nineteen bracelets. The total weight of the gold jewellery is about , and the average metal content of the jewellery pieces is 91.5% gold (about 22 carat), with small proportions in the metal of silver and copper.|$|E
5|$|Although Hall's author's note disclaims any {{real-world}} {{basis for}} the ambulance unit that Stephen joins, she drew heavily on the wartime experiences of her friend Toupie Lowther, co-commander of the only women's unit {{to serve on the}} front in France. Lowther, like Stephen, came from an aristocratic family, adopted a <b>masculine</b> style of dress, and was an accomplished fencer, tennis player, motorist and jujitsu enthusiast. In later years she said the character of Stephen was based on her, which may have been partly true.|$|E
5|$|Ardhanarishvara {{represents}} {{the synthesis of}} <b>masculine</b> and feminine energies of the universe (Purusha and Prakriti) and illustrates how Shakti, the female principle of God, is inseparable from (or the same as, according to some interpretations) Shiva, the male principle of God. The union of these principles is exalted as the root and womb of all creation. Another view is that Ardhanarishvara {{is a symbol of}} Shiva's all-pervasive nature.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists {{often make}} a {{critical}} distinction that <b>masculine</b> bias in economics {{is primarily a}} result of gender, not sex. In other words, when feminist economists highlight the biases of mainstream economics, they focus on its social beliefs about masculinity like objectivity, separation, logical consistency, individual accomplishment, mathematics, abstraction, and lack of emotion, {{but not on the}} gender of authorities and subjects. However, the over-representation of men among economists and their subjects of study is also a concern.|$|E
5|$|Ron, {{who has an}} {{extremely}} deadpan and <b>masculine</b> personality, actively works to make city hall less effective and despises interacting with the public. He loves meat, woodworking, hunting, whisky, and breakfast foods. He hates and fears his two ex-wives, both named Tammy, {{one of whom is}} played by Offerman's real-life wife, Megan Mullally. Ron claims not to be interested in the personal lives of those around him but actually cares a great deal about his colleagues, and has a particularly strong respect for Leslie.|$|E
5|$|The Shiva half has a flat <b>masculine</b> chest, a {{straight}} vertical chest, broader shoulder, wider waist and muscular thigh. He wears a yagnopavita (sacred thread) across the chest, which is sometimes {{represented as a}} naga-yagnopavita (a snake worn as a yagnopavita) or a string of pearls or gems. The yajnopavita may also divide the torso into its male and female halves. He wears ornaments characteristic of Shiva's iconography, including serpent ornaments.|$|E
5|$|Xavin is a non-binary/genderqueer Skrull (a race of shape-shifters) {{from the}} award-winning series, Runaways. Xavin {{was created by}} author Brian K. Vaughan and artist Adrian Alphona, and debuted in Runaways vol. 2 #7. Xavin had first {{appeared}} to the Runaways in their <b>masculine</b> form, but changed into their feminine form {{for the sake of}} Karolina Dean, a lesbian hero whom they were to marry. In the series, Xavin often switches between their two forms.|$|E

25|$|The <b>masculine</b> {{gender is}} also the {{indeterminate}} gender {{as in many other}} Indo-European languages. This means that for an entire mixed group of objects belonging to <b>masculine</b> and feminine genders, the <b>masculine</b> gender is used. The <b>masculine</b> as the indeterminate gender differs from the indefinite gender, which allows treatment of the word in two ways.|$|E
25|$|Some Esperanto {{roots are}} semantically <b>masculine</b> or {{feminine}}. In general, feminine words {{are derived from}} their <b>masculine</b> equivalents.|$|E
25|$|In noun declension, {{the second}} {{regressive}} palatalization originally figured in two important Slavic stem types: o-stems (<b>masculine</b> and neuter consonant-stems) and a-stems (feminine and <b>masculine</b> vowel-stems). This rule operated in the o-stem <b>masculine</b> paradigm in three places: before nominative plural and both singular and plural locative affixes.|$|E
25|$|Adjectival surnames, {{like all}} Polish adjectives, have <b>masculine</b> and {{feminine}} forms. If a <b>masculine</b> surname ends in -i or -y; its feminine equivalent ends in -a.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of puberty, {{androgen}} levels increase dramatically in males, and androgens mediate the development of <b>masculine</b> secondary sexual characteristics {{as well as the}} activation of spermatogenesis and fertility and <b>masculine</b> behavioral changes such as gynephilia and increased sex drive. <b>Masculine</b> secondary sexual characteristics include androgenic hair, voice deepening, emergence of the Adam's apple, broadening of the shoulders, increased muscle mass, and penile growth.|$|E
25|$|Hebrew makes gender {{distinction}} between <b>masculine</b> and feminine in 2nd and 3rd persons, both singular and plural. The <b>masculine</b> is collective, inclusive, but colloquially the <b>masculine</b> plural forms may be heard as gender-neutral. Hebrew is a pronoun dropping language, which is facilitated as the verbs are also inflected according to gender, number and person {{in virtually all}} forms of 2nd and 3rd singular and plural.|$|E
25|$|When {{referring}} {{to two or}} more {{members of the same}} family and surname, the suffix -ski is replaced with the plural -skich, -scy or -ccy (plural <b>masculine</b> or both <b>masculine</b> and feminine) as well as -skie or -ckie (plural feminine).|$|E
25|$|India has {{a highly}} <b>masculine</b> sex ratio, the chief reason being {{that many women}} die before {{reaching}} adulthood. Tribal societies in India have a less <b>masculine</b> sex ratio than all other caste groups. This, {{in spite of the}} fact that tribal communities have far lower levels of income, literacy and health facilities. It is therefore suggested by many experts, that the highly <b>masculine</b> sex ratio in India can be attributed to female infanticides and sex-selective abortions.|$|E
