40|$|Within {{the medical}} community, {{there has been}} {{increasing}} interest in understanding <b>material</b> <b>growth</b> in biomaterials. <b>Material</b> <b>growth</b> is the capability of a biomaterial to gain or lose mass. This research interest {{is driven by the}} host of health implications and medical problems related to this unique biomaterial property. Health providers are keen to understand the role of growth in healing and recovery so that surgical techniques, medical procedures, and physical therapy may be designed and implemented to stimulate healing and minimize recovery time. With this motivation, research seeks to identify and model mechanisms of <b>material</b> <b>growth</b> as well as growth-inducing factors in biomaterials. To this end, a theoretical formulation of stress-induced volumetric <b>material</b> <b>growth</b> in thermoelastic continua is developed. The theory derives, without the classical continuum mechanics assumption of mass conservation, the balance laws governing the mechanics of solids capable of growth. Also, a proposed extension of classical thermodynamic theory provides a foundation for developing general constitutive relations. The theory is consistent in the sense that classical thermoelastic continuum theory is embedded as a special case. Two growth mechanisms, a kinematic and a constitutive contribution, coupled in the most general case of growth, are identified. This identification allows for the commonly employed special cases of density-preserving growth and volume-preserving growth to be easily recovered. In the theory, <b>material</b> <b>growth</b> is regulated by a three-surface activation criterion and corresponding flow rules. A simple model for rate-independent finite growth is proposed based on this formulation. The associated algorithmic implementation, including a method for solving the underlying differential/algebraic equations for growth, is examined {{in the context of an}} implicit finite element method. Selected numerical simulations are presented that showcase the predictive capacity of the model for both soft and hard biomaterials...|$|R

40|$|A {{high and}} {{sustainable}} {{quality of life}} is a central goal for humanity. Our current socio-ecological regime and its set of interconnected worldviews, institutions, and technologies all support the goal of unlimited <b>growth</b> of <b>material</b> production and consumption as a proxy for quality of life. However, abundant evidence shows that, beyond a certain threshold, further <b>material</b> <b>growth</b> no longer significantly contributes to improvement in quality of life. Not only does further <b>material</b> <b>growth</b> not meet humanity's central goal, there is mounting evidence that it creates significant roadblocks to sustainability through increasing resource constraints (i. e., peak oil, water limitations) and sink constraints (i. e., climate disruption). Overcoming these roadblocks and creating a sustainable and desirable future will require an integrated, systems level redesign of our socio-ecological regime focused explicitly and directly on the goal of sustainable quality of life rather than the proxy of unlimited <b>material</b> <b>growth.</b> This transition, like all cultural transitions, will occur through an evolutionary process, but one that we, to a certain extent, can control and direct. We suggest an integrated set of worldviews, institutions, and technologies to stimulate and seed this evolutionary redesign of the current socio-ecological regime to achieve global sustainability...|$|R
