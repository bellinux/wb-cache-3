40|$|Markov chains {{have been}} widely used to the credit risk {{measurement}} in the last years. Using these chains we can model movements and distribution of clients within rating grades. However, various types of markov chains could be used. The goal of the theses is to present these types together with their advan- tages and disadvantages. We focus our attention primarily on various parameter estimation methods and hypotheses testing about the parameters. The theses should help the reader with a decision, which model of a markov chain and which method of estimation should be used for him observed data. We focus our attention primarily on the following models: a discrete-time markov chain, a continuous-time <b>markov</b> chain (we <b>estimate</b> based on continuous- time observations even discrete-time observations), moreover we present an even- tuality of using semi-markov chains and semiparametric multiplicative hazard model applied on transition intensities.

40|$|Estimating {{observability}} matrices {{or state}} sequences {{is the central}} component of existing subspace identification methods. In this paper a different approach, in which Markov parameters are first estimated under general input excitation, is proposed. The prominent difference {{of this approach is}} that a three-block arrangement of data matrices is used. It is shown that one advantage of this approach over other subspace algorithms is that several unbiased estimating procedures can be carried out. One immediate application is to obtain balanced or nearly balanced models directly from the <b>estimated</b> <b>Markov</b> parameters. Another application is that with the <b>estimated</b> <b>Markov</b> parameters, consistently initialised Kalman filter state sequences can be obtained, from which the system matrices can be easily determined without bias.

40|$|The pseudo {{likelihood}} {{method of}} Besag(1974), {{has remained a}} popular method for <b>estimating</b> <b>Markov</b> random field on a very large lattice, despite various documented deficiencies. This is partly because it remains the only computationally tractable method for large lattices. We introduce a novel method to <b>estimate</b> <b>Markov</b> random fields defined on a regular lattice. The method takes advantage of conditional independence structures and recursively decomposes a large lattice into smaller sublattices. An approximation is made at each decomposition. Doing so completely avoids the need to compute the troublesome normalising constant. The computational complexity is $O(N) $, where $N$ is the the number of pixels in lattice, making it computationally attractive for very large lattices. We show through simulation, that the proposed method performs well, even {{when compared to the}} methods using exact likelihoods. Comment: 24 pages, 8 figures, 4 table...|$|R

3000|$|Bernstein type {{inequality}} (5) {{implies a}} corresponding uniform <b>Markov</b> type <b>estimate</b> for star-like domains with Lipα boundary. Indeed, {{it is well}} known that univariate polynomials of degree at most n bounded by 1 on [- 1, 1] are also bounded by an absolute constant on the larger interval [- 1 - 1 /n^ 2, 1 + 1 /n^ 2], this easily follows, for instance, from the classical Remez inequality. Thus in case when K⊂R ^d is a Lipα star-like domain a bound that holds for a p∈ P^d_n when φ _K(x)< 1 - 1 /n^ 2 will also hold with another constant for every x∈ K. Since (5) implies a bound of magnitude cn^ 2 /α if we put φ _K(x)= 1 - 1 /n^ 2 it follows that [...] Dp _K=O(n^ 2 /α) whenever p∈ P^d_n, [...] p _K= 1. This <b>Markov</b> type <b>estimate</b> can be found in various papers (see e.g. [11] for corresponding references). The fact that a Markov type inequality of order O(n^ 2 /α) is sharp in general for Lipα domains goes back to an earlier paper by Goetgheluck [7]. Therefore Bernstein type inequality (5) must be sharp, as well, in the sense that the quantity (1 -φ _K(x))^ 1 /α- 1 / 2 in (5) can not be replaced by another function tending slower to 0 when x approaches the boundary of the domain, since this would clearly yield a better Markov type inequality.|$|R

In the multi-state framework, issues of interest include {{the study of}} the relationship between covariates and disease evolution, estimation of transition probabilities, and survival rates. This paper introduces p 3 state. msm, a software application for R which performs inference in an illness-death model. It describes the capabilities of the program for estimating semi-parametric regression models and for implementing nonparametric estimators for several quantities. The main feature of the package is its ability for obtaining non- <b>Markov</b> <b>estimates</b> for the transition probabilities. Moreover, the methods can also be used in progressive three-state models. In such a model, estimators for other quantities, such as the bivariate distribution function (for sequentially ordered events), are also given.

40|$|Numerous {{physical}} or chemical processes exhibit parameter variations due to non-stationary or nonlinear behaviour, often depending on measurable exogenous variables or measurable endogenous process states. These parameter variations can be {{captured in the}} linear parameter-varying (LPV) modeling paradigm. For control purposes, LPV state-space (SS) models are preferable, particularly with static and affine dependence on the scheduling signal. To tackle the computational complexity and perform rapid identification of LPV-SS models, a three-step approach is presented. The three steps are: 1) the estimation of the impulse response coefficients, also known as Markov coefficients, 2) an exact LPV-SS realization scheme based on these <b>estimated</b> <b>Markov</b> coefficients, and 3) an LPV-SS nonlinear optimization based refinement step. In the first step we present two possible methods: i) correlation analysis and ii) MIMO finite impulse response estimation with ridge regularization.

Finally, a third step is executed as a refinement step to reach the maximum likelihood estimate, for which two methods are considered i) an iterative LPV-SS expectation-maximization method and ii) {{an extension of the}} enhanced Gauss-Newton method...|$|R
