5|$|During the $14 million production, {{a lawsuit}} was filed by several extras who alleged {{that they were}} told to strip naked during a shower scene, but the lawsuit was {{determined}} to be without merit. The film was released in the United States and Canada in October 1998 to mixed reviews and made under $9 million. The <b>main</b> <b>actors</b> won several minor awards for their performances.|$|E
5|$|Season {{one had a}} cast of four <b>main</b> <b>actors.</b> MacFarlane voiced Peter Griffin, {{a blue-collar}} worker and the patriarch of the Griffin family. The family's evil-genius baby Stewie and their anthropromorphic pet dog Brian, were also voiced by MacFarlane. Other {{members of the family}} include Peter's {{responsible}} but rebellious wife Lois Griffin, voiced by Alex Borstein; their self-loathing goody two-shoes teenage daughter Meg, voiced by Lacey Chabert; and their socially-awkward teenage son Chris, voiced by Seth Green.|$|E
5|$|The Commonwealth, {{assertive}} militarily under King Stephen Báthory, {{suffered from}} dynastic distractions during the reigns of the Vasa kings Sigismund III and Władysław IV. It had {{also become a}} playground of internal conflicts, in which the kings, powerful magnats and factions of nobility were the <b>main</b> <b>actors.</b> The Commonwealth fought wars with Russia, Sweden and the Ottoman Empire. At the Commonwealth's height, some of its powerful neighbors experienced difficulties {{of their own and}} the Polish–Lithuanian state sought domination in Eastern Europe, in particular over Russia. Allied with the Habsburg Monarchy, it did not directly participate in the Thirty Years' War.|$|E

5|$|The {{audience}} is seated {{in front of}} the stage, to {{the left side of the}} stage, and in the corner front-left of stage; these are in order of decreasing desirability. While the metsuke-bashira pillar obstructs the view of the stage, the actors are primarily at the corners, not the center, and thus the two aisles are located where the views of the two <b>main</b> <b>actors</b> would be obscured, ensuring a generally clear view regardless of seating.|$|E
5|$|The show {{began with}} only eleven main {{characters}} {{in its first}} series, {{all of whom have}} since left the show. New main characters have been both written {{in and out of the}} series since, with a core of fifteen to twenty <b>main</b> <b>actors</b> employed on the serial at any given time. In casting the first series, Young sought out actors who were already well known in the television industry, something which has continued throughout the show's history, with cast members including Patsy Kensit, Jane Asher, Robert Powell, Adrian Edmondson, Alex Walkinshaw and Jemma Redgrave.|$|E
5|$|Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman co-produced {{most of the}} Eon films until 1975, when Broccoli {{became the}} sole producer. The single {{exception}} during this period was Thunderball, on which Broccoli and Saltzman became executive producers while Kevin McClory produced. From 1984 Broccoli was joined by his stepson Michael G. Wilson as producer and in 1995 Broccoli stepped aside from Eon {{and was replaced by}} his daughter Barbara, who has co-produced with Wilson since. Broccoli's (and until 1975, Saltzman's) family company, Danjaq, has held ownership of the series through Eon, and maintained co-ownership with United Artists since the mid-1970s. The Eon series has seen continuity both in the <b>main</b> <b>actors</b> and in the production crews, with directors, writers, composers, production designers, and others employed through a number of films.|$|E

5|$|But {{the real}} reason was that the {{production}} had financial issues, with the acquisition of new crew members {{and the increase in}} popularity of Doctor Leonard McCoy meaning that those salaries needed {{to come out of the}} original budget. In Justman and Herb Solow's 1996 book Inside Star Trek, they stated that following a discussion between Roddenberry, Solow and Bernie Weitzman in which they discussed her contract, they decided to terminate it because of Whitney's limited appearances and the financial issues that the series was having. The decision was attributed elsewhere in David Alexander's 1995 authorized biography of Gene Roddenberry, Star Trek Creator, which said that during the first batch of episodes, casting director Joseph D'Agosta reviewed the contracts for the <b>main</b> <b>actors</b> due to rising costs.|$|E
5|$|For {{the role}} of Apu, Ray advertised in {{newspapers}} for boys of ages five to seven. None of the candidates who auditioned fulfilled Ray's expectations, but his wife spotted a boy in their neighbourhood, and this boy, Subir Banerjee, was cast as Apu. (The surname {{of three of the}} <b>main</b> <b>actors</b> happened to be Banerjee, but they were not related to each other). The hardest role to fill was the wizened old Indir. Ray eventually found Chunibala Devi, a retired stage actress living in one of Calcutta's red-light districts, as the ideal candidate. Several minor roles were played by the villagers of Boral, where Pather Panchali was filmed.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} on Goldfinger commenced on 20 January 1964 in Miami, Florida, at the Fontainebleau Hotel; {{the crew}} was small, consisting only of Hamilton, Broccoli, Adam, and cinematographer Ted Moore. Sean Connery never travelled to Florida to film Goldfinger because he was filming Marnie elsewhere in the United States. On the DVD audio commentary, director Guy Hamilton states that other than Cec Linder who played Felix, none of the <b>main</b> <b>actors</b> in the Miami sequence were actually there. Connery, Gert Frobe, Shirley Eaton, Margaret Nolan who played Dink, and Austin Willis, who played Goldfinger's card victim, all filmed their parts on a soundstage at Pinewood Studios when filming moved there. Miami also served as location to the scenes involving Felix's pursuit of Oddjob.|$|E

5|$|Japanese voice {{recording}} {{for the game}} began two years before its release in 2008. Several voice actors had worked on other tri-Ace titles in the past. Beyond merely being given directions for their performances, the actors were able {{to contribute to the}} characters' personalities. Many characters were revised based on suggestions given by their voice actors during recording. The cast enjoyed their experience, as the game gave them the opportunity for a large range of performances, from comedic to dramatic scenes. Overall, the production process for both actors and development staff was a positive one. The English {{voice recording}} began in August 2009 under the supervision of Sega. Recording took place at studios in Los Angeles, and was overseen by Shimano and Suguro. Speaking about his view of the three <b>main</b> <b>actors,</b> Shimano was impressed, praising DiCocco's range and expression for Leanne and noting Menville's performances as Zephyr required fewer retakes than other actors.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the many}} {{theatrical}} devices in Angels is {{that each of the}} eight <b>main</b> <b>actors</b> has one or several other minor roles in the play. For example, the actor playing the nurse, Emily, also plays the Angel, Sister Ella Chapter (a real estate agent), and a homeless woman. This doubling and tripling of roles encourages the audience to consider the elasticity of, for example, gender and sexual identities.|$|E
25|$|The X-Files: I Want to Believe is a 2008 American supernatural thriller film {{directed}} by Chris Carter and written by both Carter and Frank Spotnitz. It {{is the second}} feature film installment of The X-Files franchise created by Carter, following the 1998 film.
