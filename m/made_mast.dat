50|$|Until {{the mid-19th}} century all vessels' masts were made of wood formed from a single or several pieces of timber which {{typically}} consisted of {{the trunk of a}} conifer tree. From the 16th century, vessels were often built of a size requiring masts taller and thicker than could be made from single tree trunks. On these larger vessels, to achieve the required height, the masts were built from up to four sections (also called masts), known in order of rising height above the decks as the lower, top, topgallant and royal masts. Giving the lower sections sufficient thickness necessitated building them up from separate pieces of wood. Such a section was known as a <b>made</b> <b>mast,</b> as opposed to sections formed from single pieces of timber, which were known as pole masts.|$|E
60|$|As {{he started}} to raise the hatch a sudden puff of wind <b>made</b> the <b>mast</b> creak loudly. This alarmed the men below and Sack Todd started up the ladder.|$|R
50|$|Use is not {{normally}} <b>made</b> of <b>masts</b> higher than five-eighths (5/8) of a wavelength, because such masts (except for some special constructions for high power mediumwave broadcasting) exhibit poor vertical radiation patterns. The heights of masts for mediumwave transmitters normally do {{not exceed the}} 300 metre (1000 foot) level.|$|R
50|$|Another notable {{section is}} {{near the village of}} Etsaut, where the route follows the Chemin de la Mâture, a track carved into a sheer cliff face. This path was created in the 18th century to {{facilitate}} the transport of tree trunks destined to be <b>made</b> into <b>masts</b> for French warships.|$|R

6000|$|The {{boat was}} indeed a large one, and would have very well carried fifteen or twenty men, and {{therefore}} was rather too big for them to manage; but as they had a fair breeze and the flood-tide with them, they did well enough; they had <b>made</b> a <b>mast</b> of a long pole, and a sail of four large goat-skins dried, which they had sewed or laced together; and away they went merrily enough; the Spaniards called after them, [...] "Bon veajo;" [...] and no man ever thought of seeing them any more.|$|R
60|$|Such a voyage, {{and with}} such a desperate crew, I believe was never made, for it is certain we took the worst {{side of the island}} to look for any shipping, {{especially}} for shipping of other nations, this being quite out of the way; however, we put to sea, after taking all our provisions and ammunition, bag and baggage, on board; we had <b>made</b> both <b>mast</b> and sail for our two large periaguas, and the other we paddled along as well as we could; but when a gale sprung up, we took her in tow.|$|R
50|$|Internally, the barrel-vaulted roof is {{supported}} by eight Tuscan columns, seven of oak and one of stone. There {{is no evidence to}} support the story that they were <b>made</b> from ships' <b>masts.</b> This gives a Dutch flavour to the architecture reminiscent of Hendrick de Keyser who built several churches in Amsterdam in the early seventeenth century.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{standard}} rig {{was made}} by Offshore Spars and was configured with triple spreaders and rod rigging. This was later changed a double spreader rig with wire rigging <b>made</b> by Seldén <b>Mast</b> AB of Sweden, but the Offshore Spars triple spreader rig remained optional. The standard rig was changed to a carbon fiber one in 2004.|$|R
50|$|The {{accumulation}} of ice {{was believed to}} have caused the collapse, but a committee of inquiry attributed it {{to a form of}} oscillation which occurred at a low but steady wind speed. Modifications, including hanging 150 tons of steel chains within each structure were <b>made</b> to similar <b>masts</b> at Belmont and Winter Hill. None of the modified masts have collapsed.|$|R
5000|$|An {{observation}} and radio tower {{stands on the}} highest point of the Merkur at [...] It was built in 1837 and was raised in height when the funicular was built. Since the 1950s it has also acted as a radio broadcast transmitter. A more recent reinforced concrete annex supports an antenna <b>mast</b> <b>made</b> of steel, reaching a total height of 63 metres.|$|R
50|$|Such {{images of}} {{spectacular}} ceremonial and royal glamour all {{apply to the}} two days of Elizabeth's visit - the 8 and 9 August. The Camp Royal itself had been in preparation for several weeks beforehand. On the river, just downstream of the Tudor blockhouse (fort), a defensive boom <b>made</b> of ships' <b>masts</b> and anchors was being constructed {{at a cost of}} over £2,000.|$|R
60|$|We stored {{ourselves}} likewise with {{oranges and}} lemons; and, buying a great quantity {{of very good}} limes, we made three or four hogsheads of lime-juice, which was a great relief to our men in the hot season, to mix with their water; as for making punch, we had some arrack and some sugar, but neither of them in such quantity as to have much punch <b>made</b> afore the <b>mast.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{vessel was}} bought in 1972 by the {{non-profit}} [...] "Lahaina Restoration Foundation" [...] in Denmark, brought to Hawaii, renamed Carthaginian II (after the eponymous {{ship in the}} novel [...] "Hawaii" [...] (1959) by James A. Michener) and restored over several years. <b>Masts</b> <b>made</b> of spruce, a deck of eucalyptus, and other details for a whaling supply ship of the 19th century were installed.

60|$|The {{necessary}} {{arrangements were}} soon <b>made,</b> the boat's <b>masts</b> unstepped, the party placed behind their covers, and the females comfortably bestowed in the spare sail, {{where they might}} got a little undisturbed sleep after the dreadful night, or morning, they had passed. Even Jack Tier lay down to catch his nap, as the most useful manner of bestowing himself {{for a couple of}} hours; the time Mulford had mentioned as the period of their stay where they were.|$|R
50|$|The club's {{flagpole}} {{was considered}} a great shame for the Chinese, as it was <b>made</b> from the <b>mast</b> of a Chinese warship captured by British and American troops. When the People's Republic of China was founded on 1 October 1949, the new Chinese national flag was hung from the pole. The new Communist government banned horse racing and gambling, and converted the racecourse into People's Park (the northern half) and People's Square (the southern half) in 1952.|$|R
500|$|Construction of the ship, now named Kreiser (Cruiser), began {{even before}} the design was approved, but changes to the design {{continued}} to be <b>made.</b> The <b>masts</b> and rigging were deleted, presumably shortly after {{the loss of the}} British masted turret ship [...] in a storm on 7 September 1870, although the exact date is not known. The decision between a ram and telescoping spar torpedoes in the ship's bow was not made until November 1870. The visit of the British naval architect Edward Reed in June 1871 prompted changes {{in the design of the}} breastwork. It was increased in thickness from [...] to [...] and extended to the sides of the ship in accordance with suggestions by Reed. Kreiser was renamed Petr Veliky on 11 June 1872, in honor of the bicentennial of Peter the Great's birth.|$|R
40|$|The {{actuator}} disc model is applied on lattice-type meteorological masts {{to estimate the}} influence of the tower on the accuracy of the measured wind speed. Combining the results with corrections for the boom, on which the anemometer is mounted, good agreement is found for measurements <b>made</b> on the <b>mast</b> at Tjcereborg. Iso-speed plots are computed to estimate the influence of different solidities.

50|$|Licensed {{supplier}} of the 49er mast {{is a company}} named Southern Spars. It is a three piece male moulded <b>mast</b> <b>made</b> from 100% standard modulus carbon. The height is 7.0 meters tall {{that is capable of}} holding a combined crew weight of 155 kg to 165 kg. It contains three sets of shrouds that connect to a fitting {{on the side of the}} boat. The crew is able to adjust them by tightening or loosening them, depending on the wind speed and sea states.|$|R
50|$|Like the {{hermaphrodite}} brig, a brigantine {{also has}} a main (second) <b>mast</b> <b>made</b> in two spars, and its large mainsail is also fore and aft rigged. However, above this it carries two or three square rigged yards instead of a gaff topsail (the hermaphrodite brig retains the gaff topsail), and carries no square rigged sail at all on its lowermost yard of its mainmast (the full-rigged brig retains a square rigged sail in this position, making {{it very difficult to}} visually distinguish at a distance from a brigantine).|$|R
2500|$|Komet was {{purchased}} in 1973 by LRF for approximately $21,000 and moved from Søby, Denmark to Hawaii by an all-Lahaina crew under diesel power, a voyage that lasted 105 days, arriving on September 7, 1973 after passing through Madeira and the Panama Canal. After installing [...] of cement and steel ballast {{to balance the}} rigging, which was being assembled onshore, it was renamed Carthaginian II and restored over several years. <b>Masts</b> <b>made</b> of spruce, a deck of eucalyptus, and other details for a whaling supply ship of the 19th century were installed. In 1980, the ship was opened as a floating whaling museum.|$|R
50|$|The Lockwood is rigged {{with two}} pole <b>masts,</b> <b>made</b> from trimmed pine trees. The {{foremast}} is 50 ft high and 12 in in diameter, while the shorter mainmast is 46 ft high and 9 in in diameter. Masts are raked at a traditionally extreme 15 degrees, facilitating sail reefing {{and maintaining a}} steady center of force under most rigging conditions. The rake also permitted the mast {{to be used as}} a crane for unloading the hold. The fore and main masts carried baggy triangular leg of mutton sails, with a jib on the foremast to the bowsprit.|$|R

I had no mast or sail in mine, but I <b>made</b> a <b>mast</b> out of a spare oar and hoisted a boat-awning for a sail, with a boat-hook for a yard. She was certainly over-masted, but I had the satisfaction of knowing that with the wind aft I could beat the other two. I {{had to wait for}} them. Then we all had a look at the captain's chart, and, after a sociable meal of hard bread and water, got our last instructions. These were simple: steer north, and keep together as much as possible. 'Be careful with that jury rig, Marlow,' said the captain; and Mahon, as I sailed proudly past his boat, wrinkled his curved nose and hailed, 'You will sail that ship of yours under water, if you don't look out, young fellow.' He was a malicious old man--and may the deep sea where he sleeps now rock him gently, rock him tenderly to the end of time! ...|$|R

60|$|While these canoes were making, the men, {{according}} to the old trade, fell to rummaging the shores of this river, as they had done the other, for gold, nor did they wholly lose their labour, for, in several places, they found some; and here it was that {{a certain number of}} them, taking one of the canoes that were first made, took a voyage of their own heads, not only without command, but against command; and, having <b>made</b> a little <b>mast</b> and sail to it, went up towards the lake, resolving to go quite into the lake to find another golden shore, or gold coast, as they called it.|$|R
50|$|After {{becoming}} {{pastor in}} 1954, Williams made vast {{improvements to the}} church such as building a low-rent apartment complex in 1969 and a parking lot that was paid off in 8 months. Williams continue to deliver sermons all across the country, however. Samuel Williams delivered a most- notable remarkable sermon on June 30, 1968, to an all white audience at All Saints Episcopal Church. There, he urged his audience to question what was their responsibility for justice, contending the power of deciding was in their field because they <b>made</b> up the <b>mast</b> majority.That is where he established his platform of schools should e a forum for the Christian's demand for justice.|$|R
40|$|An {{attempt was}} <b>made</b> to {{quantify}} <b>mast</b> cells using toluidine blue and macrophages, with alpha- 1 -antitrypsin as a marker, from adjacent sections in the mucosa of {{two groups of}} gall bladders showing either minimal inflammatory change or established chronic cholecystitis. The results were expressed as cells/mm 2 of mucosa. Alpha- 1 -antitrypsin showed both macrophages and mast cells, and therefore an estimate of macrophage numbers was obtained by subtraction. Mast cells comprised more than 60 % of the alpha- 1 -antitrypsin positive cells. There were significantly (p greater than 0. 001) more mast cells and macrophages in minimal inflammatory gall bladder mucosa than in established chronic cholecystitis...|$|R

"Though {{we could}} not well spare our fire arms, rather than they should go like naked men, we let them have two muskets, a pistol, a cutlass, and three hatchets, which were thought very {{sufficient}}: we gave them also goat's flesh, a great basket full of dried grapes, a pot of fresh butter, a young live kid, and a large canoe sufficient to carry twenty men.

50|$|The shortwave radio {{equipment}} {{used by the}} expedition was a Soviet-made solid state 10 watt tranceiver. It weighed 1.2 kilograms without batteries and had six fixed, crystal controlled frequencies for single-sideband (SSB) operation on the 80, 40 and 20 meter amateur radio bands. The 2 kg lithium battery provided the 2.2 amps at 12 V required to operate the transceiver for about a month, one hour per day, at low temperatures. The antenna for the system was an inverted-V with the <b>mast</b> <b>made</b> of five skis fitted together.

50|$|Mooring an airship by {{the nose}} {{to the top of}} a mast or tower of some kind might appear to be an obvious solution, but dirigibles had been flying for some years before the mooring <b>mast</b> <b>made</b> its appearance. The first airship known to have been moored to a mast was HMA (His Majesty's Airship) No.1, named the ‘Mayfly’, on 22 May 1911. The 38 ft mast was mounted on a pontoon, and a {{windbreak}} of cross-yards with strips of canvas were attached to it. However, the windbreak caused the ship to yaw badly, and she became more stable when it was removed, withstanding winds gusting up to 43 mph. Further experiments in mooring blimps to cable-stayed lattice masts were carried out during 1918.|$|R
2500|$|The Crowell-Collier Publishing Company had {{its roots}} in the {{agricultural}} trade of the 19th century. Industrialist Phineas P. Mast, the owner of P. P.

6000|$|The Spaniards told them, {{with great}} kindness, {{that if they}} were {{resolved}} to go they should not go like naked men, and be in no condition to defend themselves; and that though they could ill spare firearms, not having enough for themselves, yet they would let them have two muskets, a pistol, and a cutlass, and each man a hatchet, which they thought was sufficient for them. In a word, they accepted the offer; and having baked bread enough to serve them a month given them, and as much goats' flesh as they could eat while it was sweet, with a great basket of dried grapes, a pot of fresh water, and a young kid alive, they boldly set out in the canoe for a voyage over the sea, where it was at least forty miles broad. The boat, indeed, was a large one, and would very well have carried fifteen or twenty men, and therefore was rather too big for them to manage; but as they had a fair breeze and flood-tide with them, they did well enough. They had <b>made</b> a <b>mast</b> of a long pole, and a sail of four large goat-skins dried, which they had sewed or laced together; and away they went merrily together.
