His {{obituary}} in The Longford Leader noted that he [...] "...was associated with Michael Collins and other London comrades when they came to Ireland in 1916 for the Rising. After the Rising he was suspended from the Land Commission on suspicion of having been connected with the event, but was later reinstated". A detailed narrative of his activities during the 1916 Rising is contained in a handwritten letter he sent in 1937 to Máire English, supporting her claim to a <b>Military</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Pension.</b> It suggests that he was either physically in the GPO at some stage during the Rising, or in some way attached to the insurgents based there. The letter is available online at http://www.militaryarchives.ie/collections/online-collections/military-service-pensions-collection (File Reference MSP34REF24424).|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the early emergence of distributive politics in Congress – {{a key component}} of the electoral connection – by examining the rise of federal military pensions prior to the Civil War. The political responses of members of Congress to external pressures for <b>military</b> <b>service</b> <b>pensions</b> reveal that distributive interests, coupled with fiscal policies that exacerbated sectional animosities, significantly shaped the adoption and evolution of military pension legislation. Specifically, what began as a relatively simple program to provide for disabled Revolutionary War veterans grew into a mass entitlement program based on <b>military</b> <b>service.</b> Two cases are of particular interest – the Pension Acts of 1818 and 1832 – and we examine the politics of each, as well as pension-related politics in the intervening years, in detail. We contend that our analysis is crucial in establishing the applicability of key aspects of the electoral connection in the early Congress, as well as for understanding the antebellum foundations of important aspects of subsequent American political development...|$|R
500|$|During her voyages to Vietnam, Sydney transported 16,902 soldiers, 5,753 {{deadweight}} tons of cargo, 2,375 vehicles, and 14 aircraft. Initially, {{personnel from}} Sydney, the other transport ships, and their escorts, could not claim time served on logistics or escort deployments towards the active service {{requirements of the}} Vietnam Medal, the Australian Active Service Medal, or the Returned From Active Service Badge: the Department of Defence had attempted to limit the cost of repatriation benefits by taking the stance that these ships were not eligible as they were not in combat. Following numerous campaigns to change this, the Australian government issued the Returned from Active Service Badge to all these personnel in 1986, and allowed them to receive <b>military</b> <b>service</b> <b>pensions.</b> Further campaigning and legal challenges resulted {{in the creation of}} the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal in 1992, which was presented as a campaign medal to personnel who did not meet the requirements for the Vietnam Medal, but were still involved in the conflict. Similar efforts were made to have Sydneys service recognised with a battle honour: according to Nott and Payne, such a battle honour is yet to be awarded as of 2008, although a 2006 Department of Defence press release lists the honour [...] "Vietnam 1965–72" [...] among those awarded to the ship. The battle honour was confirmed in an updated list released in March 2010.|$|R

25|$|While Martin's {{record as}} finance {{minister}} was lauded {{in business and}} financial circles, there were undeniable costs. Some of these costs {{took the form of}} reduced government services, affecting the operations and achievement of the mandate of federal and provincial departments. This was probably most noticeable in health care, as major reductions in federal funding to the provinces meant significant cuts in service delivery. Martin's tactics, including those of using contributor's funds from RCMP, <b>Military</b> and Civil <b>Service</b> <b>pension</b> plans and Employment Insurance, created further controversy. CAW economist Jim Stanford said that a combination of a spending freeze at 1994 levels and lower interest rates would have eliminated the deficit in two years through economic growth alone, without the reduction in services.|$|R

Copies of archival documents also include annual reports of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs (1873, 1879 - 1882), an annual reportof the Secretary of War (1880), documents from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (1882 - 1883), an official compilation of the Navajo Campaign in New Mexico (1889), and the incorporation papers for the Chesapeake Railway Company. Additional material consists of Dubow's correspondence and notes concerning his research, his article "Simon Wolf: Champion of the American Jewish Fighting Men," and articles regarding a California War Paper (1861), the general and Jewish history of Colorado and New Mexico, and the Civil War in the SouthwestSylvan M. DubowOtto Mears (1840 - 1931) was born in Kurland, Russian and orphaned at an early age. He lived with different relatives until he ended up in San Francisco, searching for an uncle who had already left for Australia. He enrolled in the First Regiment of California Volunteers {{at the onset of}} the Civil War. During his military experiences, he participated in the Navajo War under Kit Carson's command. Upon his discharge, he moved to Sante Fe, and later to Colorado, where he built a grist mill and a road from Saguache to the Arkansas Valley. The road caught the interest of Governor Gilpin, who recommended it be built for a potential railway, and Mears applied for his first toll road. When rich mines were found in the San Juans Mountains, Mears organized a company to create toll roads earning his name "Pathfinder of San Juans. " To help promote the region, Mears published newspapers in Saguache and Lake City. In 1879, after the Meeker massacre, Mears helped rescue women captives and accompanied an Indian delegation to Washington, D. C. for treaty negotiations. Mears later expanded into railroad building, building the Rio Grande Southern and the Silverton Northern Colorado railroads.

At that time, a new pension system was introduced for the newly hired government employees and new private sector workers. Estimates are made {{of the difference between}} the present values of future contributions and the pension benefits. This approach measures the government’s net liabilities related to the accruals of the pension rights received by the individuals covered through these plans for the period from 2009 to the death of the last member in the system. The estimated unfunded cost of these civil <b>service</b> <b>pension</b> plans is 7. 3 billion euros or 276 % of GDP. This amount of implicit debt is significantly higher than 5. 8 billion euros that has been estimated as the amount of cash compensation for land and property that would need to be paid in order to reach an agreement for a solution to the Cyprus conflict. civil <b>service</b> <b>pensions,</b> pension liabilities, implicit pension debt, pension indexing, North Cyprus...|$|R
