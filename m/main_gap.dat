50|$|A {{trigatron}} {{has three}} electrodes. The heavy main electrodes {{are for the}} high current switching path, and a smaller third electrode serves as the trigger. During normal operation, the voltage between the main electrodes is somewhat lower than the breakdown voltage corresponding to their distance and the dielectric between them (usually air, argon-oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, or sulfur hexafluoride). To switch the device, a high voltage pulse is delivered to the triggering electrode. This ionizes the medium between it {{and one of the}} main electrodes, creating a spark which shortens the thickness of non-ionized medium between the electrodes. The triggering spark also generates ultraviolet light and free electrons in the <b>main</b> <b>gap.</b> These lead to the rapid electrical breakdown of the <b>main</b> <b>gap,</b> culminating in a low resistance electric arc between the main electrodes. The arc will continue to conduct until current flow drops sufficiently to extinguish it.|$|E

Regular population censuses have been taken ever since, except for the <b>main</b> <b>gap</b> between 1931 and 1961. In addition to population censuses, other statistics like number of ships entered, trade tonnage, public revenue and expenditure, death rate for European and American residents, number of schools, school attendance, number of prisoners and police strength were collected through various government departments in a scattered fashion. More details can be found in the Historical and Statistical Abstract of the Colony of Hong Kong published by the then Government House.|$|E
5000|$|Grossberg's work in {{the past}} few years has {{revolved}} around the classification theory of non-elementary classes. In particular, he has provided, in joint work with Monica VanDieren, a proof of an upward [...] "Morley's Categoricity Theorem" [...] (a version of Shelah's categoricity conjecture) for Abstract Elementary Classes with the amalgamation property, that are tame. In another work with VanDieren, they also initiated the study of tame Abstract Elementary Classes. Tameness is both a crucial technical property in categoricity transfer proofs and an independent notion of interest in the area - it has been studied by Baldwin, Hyttinen, Lessmann, Kesälä, Kolesnikov, Kueker among others.Other results include a best approximation to the <b>main</b> <b>gap</b> conjecture for AECs (with Olivier Lessmann), identifying AECs with JEP, AP, no maximal models and tameness as the uncountable analog to Fraïssé's constructions (with VanDieren), a stability spectrum theorem and the existence of Morley sequences for those classes (also with VanDieren).In addition to this work on the Categoricity Conjecture, more recently, with Boney and Vasey, new understanding of frames in AECs and forking (in the abstract elementary class setting) has been obtained.|$|E
40|$|The firing {{characteristics}} of the simple triggered vacuum gap (TVG) using lead zirconate titanate as dielectric material in the triggered gap are described. This TVG has a long life of about 2000 firings without appreciable deterioration of the electrical properties for main discharge currents upto 3 kA and is much superior to these made with Supramica (Mycalex Corporation of America) and silicon carbide as used in our earlier investigations. The effects of the variation of trigger voltage, trigger curcit, trigger pulse duration, trigger pulse energy, <b>main</b> <b>gap</b> voltage, <b>main</b> <b>gap</b> separation and main circuit energy on the firing characteristics have been studied. Trigger resistance progressively decreases {{with the number of}} firings of the trigger gap and {{as well as of the}} <b>main</b> <b>gap.</b> This decrease in the trigger resistance is more pronounced for main discharge currents exceeding 10 kA. The minimum trigger current required for reliable firing decreases with increase of trigger voltage upto a threshold value of 1. 2 kV and there-onwards saturates at 3. 0 A. This value is less than that obtained with Supramica as dielectric material. One hundred percent firing probability of the TVG at <b>main</b> <b>gap</b> voltages as low as 50 V is possible and this low voltage breakdown of the <b>main</b> <b>gap</b> appears to be similar to the breakdown at low pressures between moving plasma by other workers. and the cold electrodes immersed in it, as reported...|$|E
40|$|The {{assignment}} {{was a study}} on how the concept {{and the use of}} animal-based measures (ABMs) have penetrated the animal welfare (AW) community. The study is based on a gap mapping analysis in order to identify and describe the <b>main</b> <b>gaps</b> of ten years of activities in the EU on the use of ABMs to assess AW. The analysis was carried out by reviewing EU-research findings (i. e. EU-funded projects’ reports and peer-reviewed papers), quality assurance schemes (QAS) and taking into account EUlegislative acts on ABMs. The outcomes of the study were used for further discussion on ABMs among AW experts. The <b>main</b> <b>gaps</b> identified in scientific peer-reviewed papers were: a low number of papers with the general ABMs terms (toolbox) and heterogeneity in the use of different synonyms; a high number of specific ABMs (755) which were not easy to understand if they were similar in meaning and in measurement methods.

40|$|Nowadays the {{implementation}} of RM in enterprises has become compulsory to ensure a constant and stable growth without incurring unforeseen risks that could consequently bring about increased costs or, at worst, the firm's bankruptcy. If {{this is true for}} corporations it is even more so for small and medium enterprises that notably have fewer financial instruments at their disposal as opposed to large enterprises. In this work, the objective has been to analyse the studies conducted on risk management applied to small and medium enterprises in order to obtain, first, the quantitative evidence of the interest paid to this topic. And second, after a multi-objective classification has been performed, to highlight the different aspects of the literature by risk type, sector of application, RM stream, RM process phase and research type.

40|$|Purpose: To be {{successful}} in the service transformation, manufacturers should shift their value proposition from a product-centric one to a product-service system (PSS), and redesign their business model (BM). However, no specific model in the literature has been designed to analyse the maturity of the company’s resources and capabilities concerning this transformation. To provide a first step into closing this gap, this paper develops a maturity model that can be used by companies to assess their current BM and highlight the <b>main</b> <b>gaps</b> in the service transformation journey. Design/Methodology/Approach: This paper provides a new structured tool to evaluate the maturity level of company’s resources, capabilities and organizational and managerial aspects needed to successfully develop and deliver a PSS Findings: This paper suggests that maturity models are useful tools to assess the company’s BM and highlight the <b>main</b> <b>gaps</b> in the shift towards PSSs, supporting companies in identifying and bridging the gaps to successfully undertake the servitization journey.

40|$|The Arctic region {{undergoes}} {{rapid and}} unprecedented environmental change. Environmental assessment and monitoring {{is needed to}} understand and decide how to mitigate and/or adapt tothe changes and their impacts on society and ecosystems. This letter analyzes the application of strategic environmental assessment (SEA) and the monitoring, based on environmental observations, that {{should be part of}} SEA, elucidates <b>main</b> <b>gaps</b> in both, and proposes an overarching SEA framework to systematically link and improve both with focus on the rapidly changing Arctic region. Shortcomings in the monitoring of environmental change are concretized by examples of <b>main</b> <b>gaps</b> in the observations of Arctic hydroclimatic changes. For relevant identification and efficient reduction of such gaps and remaining uncertainties under typical conditions of limited monitoring resources, the proposed overarching framework for SEA application includes components for explicit gap/uncertainty handling and monitoring, systematically integrated within all steps of the SEA process. The framework further links to adaptive governance, which should explicitly consider key knowledge and information gaps that are identified through and must be handled in the SEA process, and accordingly (re) formulate and promote necessary new or modified monitoring objectives for bridging these gaps.
