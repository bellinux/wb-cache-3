60|$|One {{remarkable}} {{result of}} Emerson's idealism {{ought not to}} be passed over. 'The visible becomes the Bestial,' said Carlyle, 'when it rests not on the invisible.' <b>To</b> Emerson <b>all</b> rested on the invisible, and was summed up in terms of the invisible, and hence the Bestial was almost unknown in his philosophic scheme. Nay, we may say that some mighty phenomena in our universe were kept studiously absent from his mind. Here is one of the profoundest differences between Emerson and most of those who, on as high an altitude, have pondered the same great themes. A small trait will serve for illustration. It was well known in his household that he could not bear to hear of ailments. 'There is one topic,' he writes, 'peremptorily forbidden <b>to</b> <b>all</b> well-bred, <b>to</b> <b>all</b> rational mortals, namely, their distempers. If you have not slept, or if you have slept, or if you have headache, sciatica, or leprosy, or thunder-stroke, I beseech you by <b>all</b> angels <b>to</b> hold your peace, and not pollute the <b>morning,</b> <b>to</b> which <b>all</b> the housemates bring serene and pleasant thoughts, by corruption and groans. Come out of the azure. Love the day'--(Conduct of Life, 159).|$|R
25|$|Flight day six {{was devoted}} to {{transfer}} operations, and the two crews worked through the <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> complete <b>all</b> the rack transfers.

During the Mission Status briefing, Lead ISS Flight Director Ginger Kerrick noted that all the racks were now on station, and about 25% of the cargo transfers had been completed, which was slightly ahead of schedule. The two crews also began working on activating the Water Recovery System, so that samples of water from two areas could be taken and returned to Earth with Endeavour. The system's initial checkout was initiated, and water samples would be taken after several days of operation.

The hosts reached 106/3 at stumps on the fourth day, but then collapsed on the final <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> be <b>all</b> out for 186, handing Australia a 409-run victory. Cyril Washbrook and Tom Dollery top-scored for England with 37 apiece. Ernie Toshack had the pick of the figures with 5/40 while Lindwall took 3/61. Although Toshack had the better figures, commentators credited Lindwall with orchestrating the England collapse; {{at the start of}} the innings he bowled at leading English batsmen Len Hutton at great pace before dismissing him. Hutton had appeared very unsettled by Lindwall and played meekly. He was severely criticised for his timid manner and was controversially dropped for the following match as the selectors thought he was providing a poor example to the junior members of the team. The Australians were very pleased with this decision, which they believed to be wrong, as they regarded Hutton as their most formidable opponent. The match set a new record for the highest attendance at a Test in England.|$|R
