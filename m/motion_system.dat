25|$|The second law of {{thermodynamics}} requires that, in general, {{the total}} entropy of any system can't decrease other than {{by increasing the}} entropy of some other system. Hence, in a system isolated from its environment, the entropy of that system tends not to decrease. It follows that heat can't flow from a colder body to a hotter body without the application of work (the imposition of order) to the colder body. Secondly, {{it is impossible for}} any device operating on a cycle to produce net work from a single temperature reservoir; the production of net work requires flow of heat from a hotter reservoir to a colder reservoir, or a single expanding reservoir undergoing adiabatic cooling, which performs adiabatic work. As a result, there is no possibility of a perpetual <b>motion</b> <b>system.</b> It follows that a reduction in the increase of entropy in a specified process, such as a chemical reaction, means that it is energetically more efficient.|$|E

50|$|<b>Motion</b> <b>system</b> is a {{component}} of a test and measurement system that provides motion to a load or loads in a one or many directions. Generally a <b>motion</b> <b>system</b> {{is made up of}} a set (or stack) of linear and rotational stages. A linear stage moves in a straight line, while a rotation stage moves in a partial or full circle. A stage can either be manually controlled with a knob control, or automated with a motion controller.|$|E

50|$|Such {{behavior}} is easily {{applied in the}} context of aircraft simulation with very predictable and gradual maneuvers (such as commercial aircraft or larger transports). However, these slow, smooth dynamics do not exist in all practical simulation environments and diminish the returns of washout filters and a <b>motion</b> <b>system.</b> Take training of fighter pilots, for example: while the steady, cruise regime of a fighter aircraft may be able to be well simulated within these limitations, in aerial combat situations flight maneuvers are executed in a very rapid manner to physical extremes. In these scenarios, there is not time for a washout filter to react to bring the <b>motion</b> <b>system</b> back to its range equilibrium resulting in the <b>motion</b> <b>system</b> quickly hitting its range of movement limitations and effectively ceasing to accurately simulate the dynamics. It {{is for this reason that}} motion and washout filter based systems are often reserved for those that experience a limited range of flight conditions.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of friction in mechanical <b>motion</b> <b>systems</b> is a performance limiting factor as it induces stickâslip vibrations. To appropriately describe the stiction effect of friction, we adopt set-valued force laws. Then, the complete <b>motion</b> control <b>system</b> {{can be described}} by a Lurâe system with set-valued nonlinearities. In order to eliminate stickâslip vibrations for mechanical <b>motion</b> <b>systems,</b> a state-feedback control design is presented to stabilize the equilibrium. The proposed control design {{is based on an}} extension of a Popov-like criterion to systems with set-valued nonlinearities that guarantees input-to-state stability (ISS). The advantages of the presented controller is that it is robust to uncertainties in the friction and it is applicable to systems with non-collocation of actuation and friction where common control strategies such as direct friction compensation fail. Moreover, an observer-based output-feedback design is proposed for the case that not all the state variables are measured. The effectiveness of the proposed output-feedback control design is shown both in simulations and experiments for a typical <b>motion</b> control <b>system...</b>|$|R
