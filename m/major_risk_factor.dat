5|$|Substance misuse, {{dependence}} and withdrawal {{are associated with}} self-harm. Benzodiazepine dependence as well as benzodiazepine withdrawal is associated with self-harming behaviour in young people. Alcohol is a <b>major</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> for self-harm. A study which analysed self-harm presentations to emergency rooms in Northern Ireland found that alcohol was a major contributing factor and involved in 63.8% of self-harm presentations. A recent study in the relation between cannabis use and deliberate self-harm (DSH) in Norway and England found that, in general, cannabis use {{may not be a}} specific risk factor for DSH in young adolescents.|$|E
5|$|A {{small group}} of {{toddlers}} show a distressing way of reuniting after a separation. Called a disorganized/disoriented style, this reunion pattern can involve looking dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors that seem to imply fearfulness {{of the person who}} is being sought. Disorganized attachment has been considered a <b>major</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> for child psychopathology, as it appears to interfere with regulation or tolerance of negative emotions and may thus foster aggressive behavior. Disorganized patterns of attachment have the strongest links to concurrent and subsequent psychopathology, and considerable research has demonstrated both within-the-child and environmental correlates of disorganized attachment.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequent human cancers and a major cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The <b>major</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> for developing HCC are infection by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), chronic alcoholism, and aflatoxins; however, critical gene targets remain largely unknown. Herein, we sought to establish DNA methylation patterns in HCC and corresponding cirrhotic tissues and to identify DNA methylation changes associated with <b>major</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factors.</b> METHODS: We have established assays for quantitative analysis of DNA methylation levels in a panel of seven cancer-associated genes and repetitive elements, and combined these assays with a series of HCC tumors, associated with <b>major</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factors,</b> collected from two different geographical areas. RESULTS: We found a high frequency of aberrant hypermethylation of specific genes (RASSF 1 A, GSTP 1, CHRNA 3, and DOK 1) in HCC tumors as compared to control cirrhotic or normal liver tissues, suggesting that aberrant hypermethylation exhibits non-random and tumor-specific patterns in HCC. Importantly, our analysis revealed an association between alcohol intake and the hypomethylation of MGMT and between hypermethylation of GSTP 1 and HBV infection, indicating that hypermethylation of the genes analyzed in HCC tumors exhibits remarkably distinct patterns depending on associated <b>risk</b> <b>factors.</b> CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies aberrant DNA methylation of specific cellular genes in HCC and the <b>major</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> associated with these changes, providing information that could be exploited for biomarker discovery in clinics and molecular epidemiology...|$|R

25|$|Hallucinations {{can occur}} in parkinsonian syndromes {{for a variety of}} reasons. An overlap exists between PD and Lewy body dementia, so that where Lewy bodies are present in the visual cortex, {{hallucinations}} may result. Hallucinations can also be brought about by excessive dopaminergic stimulation. Most hallucinations are visual in nature, often formed as familiar people or animals, and are generally not threatening in nature. Some patients find them comforting; however, their caregivers often find this part of the disease most disturbing, and the occurrence of hallucinations is a <b>major</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> for hospitalisation. Treatment options consist of modifying the dosage of dopaminergic drugs taken each day, adding an antipsychotic drug such as quetiapine, or offering caregivers a psychosocial intervention to help them cope with the hallucinations.|$|E
25|$|Age is a <b>major</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> {{for most}} common {{neurodegenerative}} diseases, including mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease and Lou Gehrig's disease. While much {{research has focused}} on diseases of aging, there are few informative studies on the molecular biology of the aging brain (usually spelled ageing brain in British English) in the absence of neurodegenerative disease or the neuropsychological profile of healthy older adults. However, research does suggest that the aging process is associated with several structural, chemical, and functional changes in the brain as well as a host of neurocognitive changes. Recent reports in model organisms suggest that as organisms age, there are distinct changes in the expression of genes at the single neuron level. This page is devoted to reviewing the changes associated with healthy aging.|$|E
25|$|Tobacco use leads most {{commonly}} to diseases affecting the heart, liver and lungs. Smoking is a <b>major</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> for heart attacks, strokes, {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) (including emphysema and chronic bronchitis), and cancer (particularly lung cancer, cancers {{of the larynx}} and mouth, and pancreatic cancer). It also causes peripheral vascular disease and hypertension. The effects depend on the number of years that a person smokes and on how much the person smokes. Starting smoking earlier in life and smoking cigarettes higher in tar increases the risk of these diseases. Also, environmental tobacco smoke, or secondhand smoke, has been shown to cause adverse health effects in people of all ages. Tobacco use is a significant factor in miscarriages among pregnant smokers, and it contributes to a number of other health problems of the fetus such as premature birth, low birth weight, and increases by 1.4 to 3 times the chance of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Incidence of erectile dysfunction is approximately 85 percent higher in male smokers compared to non-smokers.|$|E

25|$|An {{elevated}} {{concentration of}} plasma cholesterol, especially low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, is now generally {{accepted as a}} <b>major</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> {{for the development of}} coronary heart disease. The objective is to decrease excess levels of cholesterol to an amount consistent with maintenance of normal body function. Cholesterol is biosynthesized in a series of more than 25 separate enzymatic reactions that initially involves three successive condensations of acetyl-CoA units to form the six-carbon compound 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA). This is reduced to mevalonate and then converted in a series of reactions to the isoprenes that are building-blocks of squalene, the immediate precursor to sterols, which cyclizes to lanosterol (a methylated sterol) and further metabolized to cholesterol. A number of early attempts to block the synthesis of cholesterol resulted in agents that inhibited late in the biosynthetic pathway between lanosterol and cholesterol. A major rate-limiting step in the pathway is {{at the level of the}} microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG CoA to mevalonic acid, and that has been considered to be a prime target for pharmacologic intervention for several years.|$|E
25|$|ONJ, {{even in its}} mild or minor forms, {{creates a}} marrow {{environment}} that is conducive to bacterial growth. Since many individuals have low-grade infections of the teeth and gums, this probably {{is one of the}} major mechanisms by which the marrow blood flow problem can worsen; any local infection / inflammation will cause increased pressures and clotting in the area involved. No other bones have this mechanism as a <b>major</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> for osteonecrosis. A wide variety of bacteria have been cultured from ONJ lesions. Typically, they are the same microorganisms as those found in periodontitis or devitalized teeth. However, according to special staining of biopsied tissues, bacterial elements are rarely found in large numbers. So while ONJ is not primarily an infection, many cases have a secondary, very low-level of bacterial infection and chronic non-suppurative osteomyelitis can be associated with ONJ. Fungal infections in the involved bone do not seem to be a problem, but viral infections have not been studied. Some viruses, such as the smallpox virus (no longer existent in the wild) can produce osteonecrosis.|$|E
25|$|Smoking most {{commonly}} leads to diseases affecting {{the heart and}} lungs and will {{most commonly}} affect areas such as hands or feet with first signs of smoking related health issues showing up as numbness, with smoking being a <b>major</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> for heart attacks, {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), emphysema, and cancer, particularly lung cancer, cancers of the larynx and mouth, and pancreatic cancer. Overall life expectancy is also reduced in long term smokers, with estimates ranging from 10 to 17.9. years fewer than nonsmokers. About one half of long term male smokers will die of illness due to smoking. The association of smoking with lung cancer is strongest, both in the public perception and etiologically. Among male smokers, the lifetime risk of developing lung cancer is 17.2%; among female smokers, the risk is 11.6%. This risk is significantly lower in nonsmokers: 1.3% in men and 1.4% in women. Historically, lung cancer was considered to be a rare disease prior to World War I and was perceived as something most physicians would never see during their career. With the postwar rise in popularity of cigarette smoking came a virtual epidemic of lung cancer.|$|E
