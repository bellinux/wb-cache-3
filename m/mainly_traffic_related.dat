40|$|<b>Traffic</b> <b>related</b> {{sources are}} a {{significant}} contributor of particulate matter, particularly in urban environments and major cities. <b>Traffic</b> <b>related</b> particles can be distinguished into: exhaust <b>traffic</b> <b>related</b> particles, which are emitted {{as a result of}} incomplete fuel combustion and lubricant volatilization during the combustion procedure, and non-exhaust <b>traffic</b> <b>related</b> particles, which are either generated from non-exhaust <b>traffic</b> <b>related</b> sources such as brake, tyre, clutch and road surface wear or already exist in the environment as deposited material and become resuspended due to traffic induced turbulence. It is estimated that exhaust and non-exhaust sources contribute almost equally to total traffic-related PM 10 emissions. However, as exhaust emissions control become stricter, relative contributions of non-exhaust sources to <b>traffic</b> <b>related</b> emissions will increasingly become more significant. The aim of the present literature review study is to present the state-of-the-art of the different aspects regarding particulate emissions resulting from non-exhaust sources and particularly from brake and tyre wear. For this reason several different literature sources such as peer reviewed papers, research project reports, technical publications, as well as licentiate and doctoral theses were examined and the most significant findings in terms of importance, physicochemical characteristics, EFs and possible adverse health effects are discussed.

40|$|<b>Traffic</b> <b>related</b> {{sources have}} been {{recognized}} as a significant contributor of particulate matter particularly within major cities. Exhaust and non-exhaust <b>traffic</b> <b>related</b> sources are estimated to contribute almost equally to <b>traffic</b> <b>related</b> PM 10 emissions. Non-exhaust particles can be generated either from non-exhaust sources such as brake, tyre, clutch and road surface wear or already exist {{in the form of}} deposited material at the roadside and become resuspended due to traffic induced turbulence. Among non-exhaust sources, brake wear can be a significant PM contributor, particularly within areas with high traffic density and braking frequency. Studies mention that in urban environments brake wear can contribute up to 55 % by mass to total non-exhaust <b>traffic</b> <b>related</b> PM 10 emissions and up to 21 % by mass to total <b>traffic</b> <b>related</b> PM 10 emissions, while in freeways this contribution is lower due to lower braking frequency. As exhaust emissions control become stricter, relative contributions of non-exhaust sources - and therefore brake wear - to <b>traffic</b> <b>related</b> emissions will become more significant and will raise discussions on possible regulatory needs. The aim of the present literature review study is to present the state-of-the-art of the different aspects regarding PM resulting from brake wear and provide all the necessary information in terms of importance, physicochemical characteristics, emission factors and possible health effects.

40|$|In current study, a {{mechanism}} to extract <b>traffic</b> <b>related</b> information such as congestion and incidents from textual data from the internet is proposed. The current source of data is Twitter, however, the same mechanism can be extended {{to any kind of}} text available on the internet. As the data being considered is extremely large in size automated models are developed to stream, download, and mine the data in real-time. Furthermore, if any tweet has <b>traffic</b> <b>related</b> information then the models should be able to infer and extract this data. To pursue this task, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing techniques are used. These models are designed {{in such a way that}} they are able to detect the traffic congestion and traffic incidents from the Twitter stream at any location. 	Currently, the data is collected only for United States. The data is collected for 85 days (50 complete and 35 partial) randomly sampled over the span of five months (September, 2014 to February, 2015) and a total of 120, 000 geo-tagged <b>traffic</b> <b>related</b> tweets are extracted, while six million geo-tagged non-traffic related tweets are retrieved. The classification models for detection of traffic congestion and incidents are trained on this dataset. Furthermore, this data is also used for various kinds of spatial and temporal analysis. A mechanism to calculate level of traffic congestion, safety, and traffic perception for cities in U. S. is proposed. Traffic congestion and safety rankings for the various urban areas are obtained and then they are statistically validated with existing widely adopted rankings. Traffic perception depicts the attitude and perception of people towards the traffic. 	It is also seen that <b>traffic</b> <b>related</b> data when visualized spatially and temporally provides the same pattern as the actual traffic flows for various urban areas. When visualized at the city level, it is clearly visible that the flow of tweets is similar to flow of vehicles and that the <b>traffic</b> <b>related</b> tweets are representative of traffic within the cities. With all the findings in current study, it is shown that significant amount of <b>traffic</b> <b>related</b> information can be extracted from Twitter and other sources on internet. Furthermore, Twitter and these data sources are freely available and are not bound by spatial and temporal limitations. That is, wherever there is a user there is a potential for data. M. S...|$|R

In our study region in Oregon, road traffic emissions are the biggest source of anthropogenic carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. A three-day mobile campaign covering 1700 km of roads in northwestern Oregon was performed during summer of 2012 using a laser-based Cavity Ring-Down Spectrometer.
