25|$|This <b>mesophile</b> {{forest is}} found in the wettest part of the Sierra Gorda, where the {{moisture}} can reach the east facing slopes. Most of the area is classed as moist and semi hot. (A) C (fm) by the Koppen classification, or moist and semi hot, with most rain falling in the summer rainy season but rain and fog can be found at other times too, especially in the highest elevations. The average annual rainfall is 920mm although this has varied significantly in recent years. Temperatures vary widely depending on altitude. The high mountains areas are the coldest, experiencing freezing temperatures regularly, with the lower flatter lands having more tropical or arid land characteristics. The average annual temperature is 22C, with May as the hottest month, with temperatures rising as high as 43C. In January, there can be temperatures as low as -2C. In the 2000s, areas of the state have experienced hard freezes on several occasions, with temperatures as low as -10C. These freezing temperatures are due to cold fronts coming from the north and west. These usually only produce fog and light rain, with stronger ones causing freezing temperatures. Freezing temperatures have caused emergency conditions requiring interventions by civil authorities and have also led to loss of pasture for cattle. During the rainy season, large storms can cause severe flooding along rivers such as the Moctezuma and Tancuilín. In 2010, flooding damaged crops in El Naranjo and El Lobo, with dozens of hecatares of corn damaged. The rugged geography makes roads vulnerable to landslides, with rocks up to 1.5 tons falling onto Highway 120. Recent years of drought have stressed the trees of the area and have made them vulnerable to insects.|$|E
2500|$|Most of the {{municipality}} {{is covered in}} various types of mostly deciduous forest, with leaves fully or partially fall {{during the dry season}} and the very cold weeks in December and January. Forests of pine, red and white cedar and sweetgum are prominent in the higher elevations. In the hot and dry areas, various cactus and other arid area plants such as cats claw, biznaga cactus, maguey, organ cactus, and nopals can be found. Landa has one of the few <b>mesophile</b> forests in the state of Querétaro, which is mostly found in steep canyon areas between 800 and 2000 masl. Between 600 and 800 meters, the <b>mesophile</b> forest blends with tropical rainforest such as {{in the bottom of the}} Tancuilin Canyon. A study of flora in {{the municipality}} counted 774 species of vascular plants, with the most diversity found in old growth areas where the thick tree canopy traps moisture. These areas have trees that measure thirty to forty meters in height. Most of the plant species are classified as herbs, followed by bushes, then trees, reeds, epiphyte and parasitic plants. Ninety one percent are classified as tropical vegetation. The variety of species here represents about 25% of the plant diversity in Mexico. A recently discovered species, named Physalis queretaroensis, is a rare plant restricted to the municipality. It is related to P. volubilis, [...] which is restricted to Jalisco and Michoacán, but differs in form and insertion of the leaves and vestiture.

40|$|Thermophiles are extremophiles {{that grow}} optimally at {{temperatures}} > 45 °C. To survive and maintain function of their biological molecules, {{they have a}} suite of characteristics not found in organisms that grow at moderate temperature (<b>mesophiles).</b> At the cellular level, thermophiles have mechanisms for maintaining their membranes, nucleic acids, and other cellular structures. At the protein level, each of their proteins remains stable and retains activity at temperatures that would denature their mesophilic homologs. Conversely, cellular structures and proteins from thermophiles may not function optimally at moderate temperatures. These differences between thermophiles and <b>mesophiles</b> presumably present a barrier for evolutionary transitioning between the 2 lifestyles. Therefore, studying closely related thermophiles and <b>mesophiles</b> can help us determine how such lifestyle transitions may happen. The bacterial phylum Thermotogae contains hyperthermophiles, thermophiles, <b>mesophiles,</b> and organisms with temperature ranges wide enough to span both thermophilic and mesophilic temperatures. Genomic, proteomic, and physiological differences noted between other bacterial thermophiles and <b>mesophiles</b> are evident within the Thermotogae.

50|$|Due to {{the less}} stable {{structure}} of <b>mesophiles,</b> it has reduced flexibility for protein synthesis. <b>Mesophiles</b> {{are not able to}} synthesize proteins in low temperatures. It is more sensitive to temperature changes, and the fatty acid composition of the membrane does not allow for much fluidity. Decreasing the optimal temperature of 37 °C to 0 °C to 8 °C leads to a gradual decrease in protein synthesis. Cold-induced proteins (CIPs) are induced during low temperatures, which then allows cold-shock proteins (CSPs) to synthesize.

40|$|We {{address the}} {{question}} of the thermal stability of proteins in thermophiles through comprehensive genome comparison, focussing on the occurrence of salt bridges. We compared a set of twelve genomes (from four thermophilic archaeons, one eukaryote, six mesophilic eubacteria, and one thermophilic eubacteria). Our results showed that thermophiles have a greater content of charged residues than <b>mesophiles,</b> both at the overall genomic level and in alpha helices. Furthermore, we found that in thermophiles the charged residues in helices tend to be preferentially arranged with a 1 - 4 helical spacing and oriented so that intra-helical charge pairs agree with the helix dipole. Collectively, these results imply that intra-helical salt bridges are more prevalent in thermophiles than <b>mesophiles</b> and thus suggest that they are an important factor stabilizing thermophilic proteins. We also found that the proteins in thermophiles appear to be somewhat shorter than those in <b>mesophiles.</b> However, this later observation may {{have more to do with}} evolutionary relationships than with physically stabilizing factors. In all our statistics we were careful to take into account and control for various biases. These could have, for instance, arisen due to repetitive or duplicated sequences.

40|$|Abstract Background Cold adapted or psychrophilic organisms grow at low temperatures, {{where most}} of other organisms cannot grow. This {{adaptation}} requires {{a vast array of}} sequence, structural and physiological adjustments. To understand the molecular basis of cold adaptation of proteins, we analyzed proteomes of psychrophilic and mesophilic bacterial species and compared the differences in amino acid composition and substitution patterns to investigate their likely association with growth temperatures. Results In psychrophilic bacteria, serine, aspartic acid, threonine and alanine are overrepresented in the coil regions of secondary structures, whilst glutamic acid and leucine are underrepresented in the helical regions. Compared to <b>mesophiles,</b> psychrophiles comprise a significantly higher proportion of amino acids that contribute to higher protein flexibility in the coil regions of proteins, such as those with tiny/small or neutral side chains. Amino acids with aliphatic, basic, aromatic and hydrophilic side chains are underrepresented in the helical regions of proteins of psychrophiles. The patterns of amino acid substitutions between the orthologous proteins of psychrophiles versus <b>mesophiles</b> are significantly different for several amino acids when compared to their substitutions in orthologous proteins of within the <b>mesophiles</b> or psychrophiles. Conclusion Current results provide quantitative substitution preferences (or avoidance) of amino acids that lead to the adaptation of proteins to cold temperatures. These finding would help future efforts in selecting mutations for rational design of proteins with enhanced psychrophilic properties. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{attempt to}} {{understand}} the origin of enhanced stability in thermophilic proteins by analyzing thermodynamic data for 116 proteins, the largest data set achieved to date. We compute changes in entropy and enthalpy at the convergence temperature where different driving forces are maximally decoupled, {{in contrast to the}} majority of previous studies that were performed at the melting temperature. We find, on average, that the gain in enthalpy upon folding is lower in thermophiles than in <b>mesophiles,</b> whereas the loss in entropy upon folding is higher in <b>mesophiles</b> than in thermophiles. This implies that entropic stabilization may be responsible for the high melting temperature, and hints at residual structure or compactness of the denatured state in thermophiles. We find a similar trend by analyzing a homologous set of proteins classified based only on the optimum growth temperature of the organisms from which they were extracted. We find that the folding free energy at the temperature of maximal stability is significantly more favorable in thermophiles than in <b>mesophiles,</b> whereas the maximal stability temperature itself is similar between these two classes. Furthermore, we extend the thermodynamic analysis to model the entire proteome. The results explain the high optimal growth temperature in thermophilic organisms and are in excellent quantitative agreement with full thermal growth rate data obtained in a dozen thermophilic and mesophilic organisms...|$|R
