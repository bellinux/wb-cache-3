The emirs had appointed an-Nasir Hasan in haste, having rejected the nomination of al-Amjad Husayn, another of an-Nasir Muhammads sons and the mamluks favorite for succession. An-Nasir Hasans role was ceremonial, with actual power being wielded by the following four Mamluk emirs: naib as-saltana (viceroy) Baybugha al-Qasimi, ustadar (chief of staff) and Baybughas brother, <b>Manjak</b> al-Yusufi, and the emirs Shaykhu an-Nasiri and Taz an-Nasiri. An-Nasir Hasans first year as sultan coincided with the Black Plague in Egypt, which peaked in October-December 1348 and ended in February 1349. In 1350, an-Nasir Hasan attempted to assert his executive power by assembling a council of the four qadis (chief judges), declaring to them that he had reached adulthood and thus no longer required the emirs guardianship. He concurrently dismissed <b>Manjak</b> as wazir (vizier) and ustadar. However, an-Nasir Hasans attempt to assert administrative authority was stifled by Taz a few months later.|$|E

At the onset of Salih's reign, emirs Shaykhu and <b>Manjak</b> (Baybugha's brother) were released. In effect, Emir Taz was the ruler of the sultanate and Salih was a figurehead sultan. However, Salih did assert his authority when Emir Baybugha launched a rebellion in Syria in 1352. Salih led his army to Damascus and confronted the rebels. Baybugha and the nuwwab (governors, sing. na'ib) of Safad, Hama and Tripoli were ultimately imprisoned, and Byabugha died while incarcerated in Aleppo later that year.|$|E
50|$|Shaykhu {{began his}} career as a mamluk (manumitted slave soldier) during the third reign of Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad (r. 1310-1341). Shaykhu rose to become a {{high-ranking}} emir under Sultan al-Muzaffar Hajji (r. 1346-1347). During the first term of the latter's child successor, an-Nasir Hasan, Shaykhu emerged as one of the four influential Mamluk emirs who wielded power in the sultanate. An-Nasir Hasan moved to assert his authority over the emirs in 1350 by arresting Shaykhu and Emir <b>Manjak</b> al-Yusufi, imprisoning them both in Alexandria. Shaykhu was pardoned in 1351 following Hasan's ouster and replacement by Sultan as-Salih Salih and the strongman of the sultanate, Emir Taz an-Nasiri. Shaykhu returned to Cairo where he and Taz effectively held the levers of power and supervised the affairs of the state. During this three-year period (1352-1355), Shaykhu commissioned the construction of a sabil kuttab (public fountain where the Qur'an was taught) in Cairo.|$|E
50|$|He {{was assassinated}} in 1357 C.E. Bey, the amir <b>Manjak</b> vizier, one of the Sultan’s Mamluks {{attacked}} him with a sword while Shaykhu {{was sitting at the}} House of Justice. The people in the Cairo Citadel panicked, causing so much turmoil throughout the crowd that people were killed. Bey was seized in the Mausoleum of al-Nasir, outside of Cairo, by ten of the grand amirs in full armor. Bey confessed and took full responsibility. “He said: ‘I brought to Shaykhu a request for a transfer from salary to landed property, but he did not gratify my concern. That decision had an overpowering influence on my soul’” (Smith). He was imprisoned before his execution by being impaled and afterwards his corpse circulated through the streets. Shaykhu was not killed instantly by the attacked but never recovered and died on the night of Friday, the 16th day of Dhu al-Qa’da in 758 or 1357 C.E. He is buried in his own khanqah and supplied the funds so that the Qur’an would be perpetually read at his tomb.|$|E
5000|$|In 1672, the Turkish {{traveler}} Evliya Celebi visited al-Ukhaydir {{and described}} it as a strongly-built, square building with a mosque, enough rooms to house forty soldiers, a separate room for the Jannisary commander, twelve long cannons and a reservoir was supplied by three channels. Celebi also noted that the site and its vicinity was inhabited by Bedouin from the Haydari Sufi order who claimed their ancestor, Ali Haydar al-Qarrar, built a fort at the site in 667 CE. Based on 20th-century excavations at the site, archaeologist Andrew Petersen concludes that a fort pre-dating the Ottomans likely existed at the site. Celebi further noted that the fort had been previously restored by a Damascene official named Haydar Pasha. The Sufi traveler Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi also noted the fort's strength and claimed it was named [...] "al-Ukhaydir" [...] after the Muslim holy figure of al-Khadr (identified with Elijah), who according to legend, dug the fort's well, which contained high-quality water. In the early 18th century, al-Ukhaydir was controlled by the Bani <b>Manjak</b> tribe. Further religious association to the site was reported by the Turkish traveler Mehmed Edib in the late 18th century, including that Ali Haydar's tomb was located there and was a pilgrimage site for Bedouin tribesmen and that it was the place where Job was covered with insects which were turned into stones.|$|E

40|$|Želimo uočiti pozitivne elemente i naglaske koji bi trebali biti prisutniji u novoj evangelizaciji kada je riječ o očekivanju eshatona. Vremenom se u pastvu Crkve uvuklo izričaja i shvaćanja koja ne odgovaraju biblijskom učenju kao i današnjem naučavanju Crkve te pokoncilskom teološkom razmišljanju. <b>Manjak</b> eshatološke svijesti i spasiteljske nade, te zauzetog iščekivanja "novog neba i nove zemlje" pogoduje stvaranju umornog kršćanstva, {{a time i}} priklanjanju raznim ezoterijskim prorokovanjitna i strahovima. Iščekivanje, s druge strane, nipošto ne umanjuje čovjekovo zalaganje na zemlji već mu naprotiv daje novi smisao i elan. U tom svjetlu ističu se neki pomaci u govoru o "posljednjim stvarima", tj. o smrti, sudu, čistilištu, raju ili paklu. Naglasak se pomiče od straha na odgovornost i ozbiljnost, a poglavito na radost konačnog susreta s Bogom i uspjelim ljudima. SUMMARY Starting {{from the}} fact that the {{expectation}} of the coming century or New God 2 ̆ 7 s World, in other words, eschatological consciousness which needs to be in the principles of the Christian belief and life, this article is trying to answer the question how to place the mentioned theme in the process, of the New Evangelisation. In this sense, it is endeavoured to speak up about the "De Novissimis" or precisely, about the realities which will be shown in a final meeting and union with God and the rest of successful people. This is the way we should see the need of authentic Christian attitude referring death and dying, as one of the stages to human termination. It gets completely new importance when it happens on Christ way and together with Christ. This stage represents the end of sin and various evil during lifetime, from baptism on. Speaking of judgement that will happen at the end of life and world, there in no intention to frighten but imply on necessity to emphasise the responsibility and seriousness in life. For, there is a possibility for human being to succeed and enter the joy of eternal life, or to thoroughly fall into an eternal death. Walking toward success or to the entrance of paradise, there is a possibility that a human being has to go through the stage of purgatory, which means purification of last zones of resistance that keep him from living his eternal life with God. When describing paradise, we emphasise the communication and community in permanent growth in full life, in human being 2 ̆ 7 s prosperity in a world of God 2 ̆ 7 s life. Regarding Hell, it is pointed out as necessity to redress the vision of God who "is punishing and determining someone for destruction". On contrary, a human being decides himself for Hell. With certain lifestyle, refusing God 2 ̆ 7 s love, he excludes himself from community and rejoice with God and other successful people. Biblical pictures needn 2 ̆ 7 t have to be repeated in sense of threat, but as an invitation for responsibility and possibility of destruction if conversion is not accepted. In a word, we start {{from the fact that}} eschatological dimension, the complete human achievement in a sphere of forthcoming, has to be in centre of preachment and catechesis, in the light of authentic biblical interpretation of the Magisterium of the Church, Second Vatican Council, as well as current theological reflections, considering that the eschatological hope does not reduce but, on contrary, dynamize the completion of earthly duties. A human being receives new incentive for intensive life, stronger and productive moral on earth with a power of Eschaton, where in fact his Eschaton begins...|$|E

O tome izravno svjedoče četiri novoprona đe na spisa koja je 20. rujna 1552. dala regi stri rati u dubrovačkom Notarijatu. Du bro vačke vlasti su pomno zapisivale svaku pojedinost iz političkog, gospodarskog, pri vat nog i javnog života Republike. Zato je <b>manjak</b> podataka o poznatoj osobi kakva je bila Gracija Mendes vrlo neobičan. Ta činjenica, kao i sadržaj spomenutih spisa, po ta knuli su nas da pokušamo odgovoriti na razna pitanja koja se tiču njena boravka u Du bro vni ku i poslovanja s Dubrovčanima. The name of Gracia Mendes alias Beatrice de Luna has {{attracted}} the attention of many historians researching the life of this exceptional business woman, a Portuguese conversa, {{from the middle of the}} sixteenth century. Although much of Gracia 2 ̆ 7 s life has been reconstructed – from her birth in Lisbon around 1510 until death in Constantinople in the early months of 1569 – yet her final decision to choose the sultan 2 ̆ 7 s haven over the West remains obscure. A most recent discovery at the State Archives in Dubrovnik has helped elucidate this gap, providing evidence on Gracia 2 ̆ 7 s stay in Dubrovnik in 1552, where she and her daughter Ana found temporary shelter having fled from the Apennine Peninsula. Realising that the Western potentates were a threat to her wealth and person by suspecting her of heresy and return to the faith of her Jewish ancestors, Gracia decided to follow the path of many compatriots before her. However, Gracia 2 ̆ 7 s established business ties in the commercial and financial centres of West Europe were a solid enough reason for her to act warily, not only by protecting her own property but by making sure that her decision would not harm her loyal business partners. For this reason, on 20 September 1552 Gracia Mendes registered four documents at the Dubrovnik notary office, by which her former partners were exempted from any liability and responsibility, and by which she settled all her debts towards them. Although her arrival in Dubrovnik was clandestine, the Senate offered her protection and support. By acting against certain influential individuals from the political and Church circles who strongly disapproved any collaboration with a crypto-Jewess in exile, the Ragusan authorities once again displayed their mercy, but equally so proved to have a sharp eye for anything that could be of concrete benefit for the state. The rightness of their step manifested in Gracia 2 ̆ 7 s decision to choose no other but Dubrovnik for her main port in trading with the West, which she was soon to conduct from Constantinople. To mutual satisfaction, the business relations lasted for almost twenty years, until Gracia 2 ̆ 7 s death. The episode of her visit to Dubrovnik bears a twofold meaning. On the one hand, it represents an important element in the multilayered mosaic of Gracia 2 ̆ 7 s meandring life path, by which she largely propagated the consciousness of her people and of the ability of women in general. On the other, by offering her hospitality and showing disregard for the possible consequences such an act may have caused on the domestic and foreign scene, Ragusan Senate was not solely led by the expected financial gain but also proved its greatness through a lasting spiritual good: by supporting the threatened minority, they truly shielded the weak...|$|E

Pilara. U članku se daje sažet pregled njegova životnog puta (obitelj, školovanje, mladenački dani, profesionalni život pravnika/odvjetnika, politički angažman i sudjelovanje u javnom/kulturnom, šire-društvenom životu) prije i nakon g. 1918. i ističe raznovrsnost njegovih stručnih i znanstvenih interesa, koji se ogledaju i u tematici spisa jednoga među prvim teoretičarima hrvatske modernizacije. Ivo Pilar (Zagreb, 1874 - 1933) {{belongs to}} a larger group of {{distinguished}} people of Croatia’s public life who worked {{near the end of}} the 19 th and during the first half of the 20 th century, and yet no reliable biographies of the same are available. According to the author, one of the underlying reasons for this is to be found in the disinclination of the “socialist rule” after 1945 to facilitate (i. e. permit) any objective research of the corpus of Croatian civil politics of the period in question, warning of the fact that no serious study of “contemporary history” (in the German science of history:‘Zeitgeschichte’) in Croatia — with due exceptions — had been conducted before the 1970 s; in fact, freedom of approach and research was achievable only after 1990, when the imposed “embargo” on the life and work of Ivo Pilar was lifted. Extensive research of Pilar’s work and activities began as late as 2000 (the results of which are being published in Godiπnjak PILAR / PILAR Yearbook, 1 / 2001 and 2 / 2002, by the Ivo Pilar Institute of Social Sciences, Zagreb). The author highlights that, regarding a whole series of unresearched questions, we have not yet (seriously) started. Nevertheless, one can state, with certainty, that Pilar is one of the most intriguing phenomena of Croatia’s public life of the time. He was a lawyer and sociologist by profession (he studied in Vienna and Paris), and he gained the attribute of a “theoretician of modernisation” as early as 1898 with his work Secesija / Secession (although the field of his research here is fine art, his discourse has much wider social implications). He worked in judicature and banking, and had a reputable law practice from 1905 until he died (first in Tuzla until 1920 and then in Zagreb). He was a noted political publicist with two important works published (under pseudonyms) in the original, i. e. in the German language (Südslawische Frage und der Weltkrieg / The Southern-Slavic Question and the World War, Vienna 1918, and Immer wieder Serbien / Always and Only Serbia, Berlin 1933). There was considerable interest in the Southern-Slavic question in the world even after World War I (one of the people who was presented with a copy by the author himself was the then American president Harding). Professionally and scientifically, Pilar was interested in several different disciplines: law, geopolitics, sociology, psychology, anthropology, literary theoretical questions and history (from medieval to contemporary). He was politically active between 1906 and 1918 not only in Bosnia and Herzegovina (where he lived and worked for 20 years) but also in the entire Habsburg Monarchy, attempting in vain to get the country’s ruling elites to implement administrative, legal and political reforms, firmly believing that these reforms were the only possible way to preserve this Central-European union of nations. He was opposed, on principle, to the constitution of a common Southern-Slavic state, having rightly cautioned of the Great Serbian hegemony. Thus, from 1918 he was under the watchful eye of the authorities — so disinclined to him ‡ of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes/Yugoslavia. He then became widely socially active, although remained politically active too “behind the curtain”, having established contacts from the time of the murder of Stjepan Radić in the parliament building in Belgrade with some of the most distinguished Croatian politicians (Ante Trumbić, Vladko Maček et al.). He died in Zagreb under mysterious circumstances that remain unresolved to date (suicide? political murder?) ...|$|E
40|$|Background Multi-strategic {{community}} wide {{interventions for}} physical activity are increasingly popular but {{their ability to}} achieve population level improvements is unknown. Objectives To evaluate the effects of community wide, multi-strategic interventions upon population levels of physical activity. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Public Health Group Segment of the Cochrane Register of Studies,The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, PsycINFO, ASSIA, the British Nursing Index, Chinese CNKI databases, EPPI Centre (DoPHER, TRoPHI), ERIC, HMIC, Sociological Abstracts, SPORTDiscus, Transport Database and Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Social Sciences Citation Index, Conference Proceedings Citation Index). We also scanned websites of the EU Platform on Diet, Physical Activity and Health; Health-Evidence. org; the International Union for Health Promotion and Education; the NIHR Coordinating Centre for Health Technology (NCCHTA); the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and NICE and SIGN guidelines. Reference lists of all relevant systematic reviews, guidelines and primary studies were searched and we contacted experts in the field. The searches were updated to 16 January 2014, unrestricted by language or publication status. Selection criteria Cluster randomised controlled trials, randomised controlled trials, quasi-experimental designs which used a control population for comparison, interrupted time-series studies, and prospective controlled cohort studies were included. Only studies with a minimum six-month follow up {{from the start of}} the intervention to measurement of outcomes were included. Community wide interventions had to comprise at least two broad strategies aimed at physical activity for the whole population. Studies which randomised individuals from the same community were excluded. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. Each study was assessed for the setting, the number of included components and their intensity. The primary outcome measures were grouped according to whether they were dichotomous (per cent physically active, per cent physically active during leisure time, and per cent physically inactive) or continuous (leisure time physical activity time (time spent)), walking (time spent), energy expenditure (as metabolic equivalents or METS)). For dichotomous measures we calculated the unadjusted and adjusted risk difference, and the unadjusted and adjusted relative risk. For continuous measures we calculated percentage change from baseline, unadjusted and adjusted. Main results After the selection process had been completed, 33 studies were included. A total of 267 communities were included in the review (populations between 500 and 1. 9 million). Of the included studies, 25 were set in high income countries and eight were in low income countries. The interventions varied by the number of strategies included and their intensity. Almost all of the interventions included a component of building partnerships with local governments or non-governmental organisations (NGOs) (29 studies). None of the studies provided results by socio-economic disadvantage or other markers of equity. However, of those included studies undertaken in high income countries, 14 studies were described as being provided to deprived, disadvantaged or low socio-economic communities. Nineteen studies were identified as having a high risk of bias, 10 studies were unclear, and four studies had a low risk of bias. Selection bias was a major concern with these studies, with only five studies using randomisation to allocate communities. Four studies were judged as being at low risk of selection bias although 19 studies were considered to have an unclear risk of bias. Twelve studies had a high risk of detection bias, 13 an unclear risk and four a low risk of bias. Generally, the better designed studies showed no improvement in the primary outcome measure of physical activity at a population level. All four of the newly included, and judged to be at low risk of bias, studies (conducted in Japan, United Kingdom and USA) used randomisation to allocate the intervention to the communities. Three studies used a cluster randomised design and one study used a stepped wedge design. The approach to measuring the primary outcome of physical activity was better in these four studies than in many of the earlier studies. One study obtained objective population representative measurements of physical activity by accelerometers, while the remaining three low-risk studies used validated self-reported measures. The study using accelerometry, conducted in low income, high crime communities of USA, emphasised social marketing, partnership with police and environmental improvements. No change in the seven-day average daily minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity was observed during the two years of operation. Some program level effect was observed with more people walking in the intervention community, however this result was not evident in the whole community. Similarly, the two studies conducted in the United Kingdom (one in rural villages and the other in urban London; both using communication, partnership and environmental strategies) found no improvement in the mean levels of energy expenditure per person per week, measured from one to four years from baseline. None of the three low risk studies reporting a dichotomous outcome of physical activity found improvements associated with the intervention. Overall, there was a noticeable absence of reporting of benefit in physical activity for community wide interventions in the included studies. However, as a group, the interventions undertaken in China appeared to have the greatest possibility of success with high participation rates reported. Reporting bias was evident with two studies failing to report physical activity measured at follow up. No adverse events were reported. The data pertaining to cost and sustainability of the interventions were limited and varied. Authors' conclusions Although numerous studies have been undertaken, there is a noticeable inconsistency of the findings in the available studies and this is confounded by serious methodological issues within the included studies. The body of evidence in this review does not support the hypothesis that the multi-component community wide interventions studied effectively increased physical activity for the population, although some studies with environmental components observed more people walking. Plain language summary Community wide interventions for increasing physical activity Not having enough physical activity leads to poorer health. Regular physical activity can reduce the risk of chronic disease and improve one's health and wellbeing. The lack of physical activity is a common and in some cases a growing health problem. To address this, 33 studies have used improvement activities directed at communities, using more than one approach in a single program. When we first looked at the available research in 2011 we observed that there was a lack of good studies which could show whether this approach was beneficial or not. Some studies claimed that community wide programs improved physical activities and other studies did not. In this update we found four new studies that were of good quality; however none of these four studies increased physical activity levels for the population. Some studies reported program level effects such as observing more people walking, however the population level of physical activity had not increased. This review found that community wide interventions are very difficult to undertake, and it appears that they usually fail to provide a measurable benefit in physical activity for a population. It is apparent that many of the interventions failed to reach a substantial portion of the community, and we speculate that some single strategies included in the combination may lack individual effectiveness. Laički sažetak Intervencije u zajednici za povećanje tjelesne aktivnosti Nedostatna tjelesna aktivnost povezana je s lošijim zdravljem. Redovita tjelesna aktivnost može umanjiti rizik od kroničnih bolesti te poboljšati zdravlje i kvalitetu života pojedinca. <b>Manjak</b> tjelesne aktivnosti čest je problem, a učestalost tog problema se povećava. Cochrane sustavni pregled je analizirao 33 studije koje su istražile programe za povećanje tjelesne aktivnosti u zajednici, u kojima se koristilo više od jednog pristupa. Kad su prvi put pregledani dokazi iz istraživanja koja su bila dostupna 2011. godine, utvrđeno je da nema dovoljno dobrih studija koje bi mogle pokazati je li takav pristup koristan ili ne. Primjerice, neke studije tvrde da programi za povećanje tjelesne aktivnosti u zajednici poboljšavaju tjelesnu aktivnost pojedinaca u zajednici, a druge studije tvrde suprotno. U ovom obnovljenom sustavnom pregledu pronađene su 4 nove studije koje su bile visoke kvalitete, ail nijedna od tih studija nije pokazala da je istraživana intervencija dovela do povećanja tjelesne aktivnosti u zajednici. Neke su studije opisale učinak na način da je opisano da je uočeno da više ljudi u zajednici hoda, međutim, ukupna razina tjelesne aktivnosti u promatranoj populaciji nije se povećala. Ovaj sustavni pregled je utvrdio da je intervencije za povećanje tjelesne aktivnosti u zajednici teško provesti i čini se da one obično ne uspijevaju u svojoj namjeri da na mjerljiv način povećaju tjelesnu aktivnost u populaciji. Čini se da mnoge intervencije nisu uspjele doseći veći broj stanovnika u zajednici pa se može smatrati da neke od strategija uključene u analizirane kombinacije nisu zasebno učinkovite...|$|E
