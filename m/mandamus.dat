5|$|Still in January, Martindale {{applied to}} the Supreme Court for <b>mandamus,</b> and the court issued an {{alternative}} <b>mandamus</b> (essentially, an order to show cause why peremptory <b>mandamus</b> should not issue) on March 6, 1845, which was served March 25. On April 19, the deadline was extended to the first Tuesday in June. Before the Supreme Court, Martindale was joined by New York Attorney General John Van Buren and opposed by A. Taber and J. L. Brown.|$|E
5|$|The {{court also}} found the {{affidavit}} of Parker to be insufficient as a factual matter {{to comply with the}} terms of the statute. However, even if the district attorney had brought the action and the affidavit had been sufficient, the Supreme Court still would have denied <b>mandamus</b> as a matter of law.|$|E
5|$|From 18211846, the {{district}} attorney would have been appointed; thereafter, the office was elected. Martindale was {{the district}} attorney of Genesee County from 18421844 and again from 18471849. Thus, Martindale himself filed the complaints in People ex rel. Blacksmith v. Tracy and People ex rel. Waldron v. Soper, and his successor, Seth Wakeman (18501855) filed the complaint in New York ex rel. Cutler v. Dibble. Although Martindale was district attorney when the complaint in Tracy was filed, he lost the election and attempted to litigate the <b>mandamus</b> issue as a private attorney.|$|E
5|$|In Marbury, the Supreme Court {{held that}} Madison's failure {{to deliver the}} {{commission}} to Marbury was illegal, but did not grant Marbury a writ of <b>mandamus</b> {{on the ground that}} § 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 was unconstitutional insofar as it authorized the Court to issue such writs under its original jurisdiction. Stuart v. Lairdinvolving a civil judgment rendered by a circuit court constituted under the Midnight Judges Act and enforced by a circuit court constituted under the Judiciary Act of 1802challenged the constitutionality both of abolishing the circuit judgeships and of requiring the Supreme Court justices to ride circuit. In a brief opinion, the Court rejected both challenges.|$|E
5|$|In March 1891, Clayton and C.Wood Daily of Keyser argued {{on behalf}} of the West Virginia Central and Pittsburgh Railway Company in a <b>mandamus</b> case at the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia brought by a {{director}} of the company, W.Irvine Cross. Alex Shaw of Baltimore claimed his right to cumulate his stock ownership in the company, and elected Cross as a director of the company. On March 24, the court ruled that the company was governed by the cumulative method, and therefore, Cross was entitled to his director seat.|$|E
5|$|The ancient {{remedies}} of certiorari, <b>mandamus,</b> prohibition and {{habeas corpus}} were originally only {{available to the}} British Crown and thus termed prerogative writs, that is, writs that could be issued at the prerogative of the sovereign. By {{the end of the}} 16th century, they could theoretically be sought by any aggrieved citizen. In 1938, the writs were abolished in the United Kingdom and replaced by prerogative orders with essentially the same names and functions. As a former British colony, Singapore inherited English administrative law at independence and the Singapore courts continue to pay close attention to English cases. In Singapore, the prerogative orders were known by their traditional names until 2006, when the names were modernized.|$|E
5|$|The {{court also}} reviews death penalty cases, state tax court appeals, and items {{regarding}} legal discipline on direct review. Direct review {{means that the}} Supreme Court hears cases directly upon appeal without the case first going to the Court of Appeals. Other direct review items include state agency decisions such as the placement of prisons, placement of energy production facilities, locations of sites for solid waste disposal, and some labor law injunctions. Additionally, the court has original jurisdiction in, writs of <b>mandamus,</b> writs quo warranto, writs of habeas corpus, reapportionment of state legislative districts, and challenges to ballot measures such as their titles, the fiscal impact statement, and the explanatory statement as listed in the Voter’s Pamphlet.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Chief Justice Marshall's tenure, the Supreme Court {{had heard}} only two {{criminal}} casesboth by prerogative writ. First, in United States v. Hamilton (1795), the Court granted bail to a capital defendant charged with treasonas it was authorized {{to do by}} § 33 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 and § 4 of the Judiciary Act of 1793on an original writ of habeas corpus. The greater portion of the decision was dedicated to the Court's refusal to order the case tried by a special circuit court, as was provided for by § 3 of the Judiciary Act of 1793. Second, in United States v. Lawrence (1795), the Court declined to issue a writ of <b>mandamus</b> to compel a district judge to order the arrest of a deserter of the French navy, as the French government argued to be required by the consular convention between the United States and France.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court had other, limited {{sources of}} appellate {{jurisdiction}} in criminal cases. The Court could hear criminal appeals {{from the state}} courts by writ of error, as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1789. The Court could hear federal criminal appeals by certificate of division, as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1802, original habeas petition, as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1789, and <b>mandamus,</b> as authorized by the same act. Between 1867 and 1868, and after 1885, the Court had jurisdiction to hear writs of error from habeas petitions (a civil action) in the circuit courts. Beginning in 1850, the Court also entertained such appeals from the territorial courts. Attempts to utilize other prerogative writs as sources of jurisdiction were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The {{remedies}} {{available in}} Singapore administrative law are the prerogative orders – the mandatory order (formerly known as <b>mandamus),</b> prohibiting order (prohibition), quashing order (certiorari), and order for review of detention (habeas corpus) – and the declaration, {{a form of}} equitable remedy. In Singapore, administrative law is the branch of law that enables a person to challenge an exercise of power by {{the executive branch of}} the Government. The challenge is carried out by applying to the High Court for judicial review. The Court's power to review a law or an official act of a government official is part of its supervisory jurisdiction, and at its fullest may involve quashing an action or decision and ordering that it be redone or remade.|$|E
5|$|However, the United Kingdom courts {{gradually}} {{adopted a}} single sufficient interest test for all prerogative orders. In R. v. Commissioners of Customs and Excise, ex parte Cook (1969), for example, the High Court used a sufficient interest test {{to determine whether}} an applicant had standing {{to apply for a}} mandatory order. Singapore followed the UK's move towards a uniform test for all prerogative orders. In Re Lim Chor Pee, ex parte Law Society of Singapore (1986), the Court of Appeal endorsed the sufficient interest test for mandatory orders. In that case, the Law Society of Singapore had applied for a <b>mandamus</b> (now known as a mandatory order) to ensure that the Disciplinary Committee heard and investigated all six charges levied against an advocate and solicitor. The Court, applying the decision of the House of Lords in R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd. (1981), held that the test for standing was whether the applicant had a sufficient interest in the subject matter, and not whether he or she had a specific legal right.|$|E
5|$|The Right to Constitutional Remedies {{empowers}} {{citizens to}} approach the Supreme Court of India to seek enforcement, or protection against infringement, of their Fundamental Rights. Article 32 provides a guaranteed remedy, {{in the form of}} a Fundamental Right itself, for enforcement of all the other Fundamental Rights, and the Supreme Court is designated as the protector of these rights by the Constitution. The Supreme Court has been empowered to issue writs, namely habeas corpus, <b>mandamus,</b> prohibition, certiorari and quo warranto, for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights, while the High Courts have been empowered under Article 226 – which is not a Fundamental Right in itself – to issue these prerogative writs even in cases not involving the violation of Fundamental Rights. The Supreme Court has the jurisdiction to enforce the Fundamental Rights even against private bodies, and in case of any violation, award compensation as well to the affected individual. Exercise of jurisdiction by the Supreme Court can also be suo motu or on the basis of a public interest litigation. This right cannot be suspended, except under the provisions of Article 359 when a state of emergency is declared.|$|E
5|$|The first {{shipment}} of coins, $130,000 in half dollars, arrived by ship on December 9, 1883. Hawaii {{was still in}} an economic recession. A number {{of members of the}} business community, including Sanford B. Dole, objected to the issue on the grounds that so much silver would inflate the currency, and went to court to prevent the government from giving Spreckels bonds in exchange for anything except gold coin, as the law required. The government opposed the action, which was brought in the islands' supreme court, {{on the grounds that the}} silver coins were equivalent to gold. The chief justice, A. F. Judd, granted a temporary writ of <b>mandamus</b> against the government giving the Dole plaintiffs what they wanted, finding that the coins were not equivalent to gold, and that the coinage and loan acts had been violated. On appeal to the full court, though, Judd was reversed, as the court found that Dole and his associates should have filed for an injunction. But when they did, the petition was denied. In the interim at a meeting chaired by the king, the privy council had declared the new coinage a legal tender; once the lawsuit was resolved, the government paid for a half million dollars in coins with a like amount of bonds.|$|E
5|$|Re Lim Chor Pee, {{ex parte}} Law Society of Singapore (1985) {{is another example}} of a case where a {{mandatory}} order was granted by the High Court. The appellant, Lim Chor Pee, who was an advocate and solicitor, had been convicted of several income tax offences and had been found to have tampered with a witness. On 16 July 1982, the Attorney-General wrote to the President of the Law Society of Singapore, providing information on the appellant's conviction and other records. Following a report by the Society's Inquiry Committee that a formal inquiry into the appellant's conduct was necessary, a Disciplinary Committee was appointed. The appellant successfully applied to the Disciplinary Committee to delete certain paragraphs of the statement of case which had been formulated against him by the Council of the Law Society, on the ground that the facts in those paragraphs did not appear in the Inquiry Committee's report. Consequently, three of the six charges against the appellant and a major portion of one other charge did not require investigation by the Disciplinary Committee. Dissatisfied with this decision, the Law Society applied to the High Court for an order of <b>mandamus</b> to direct the Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate all the six charges against the appellant. The High Court granted the application, holding that under the Legal Profession Act, the Inquiry Committee's only function was to consider the matters before it and decide whether or not there should be a formal investigation by a Disciplinary Committee. It was the duty of the Council of the Law Society to draw up the charges, and the duty of the Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate the charges properly before the Committee in the statement of case. Thus, the appellant could not object that some of the charges against him were based on facts not mentioned in the Inquiry Committee's report. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.|$|E
25|$|The Waite Court heard two {{criminal}} cases under the prerogative writ of <b>mandamus</b> (habeas corpus {{is also a}} prerogative writ). In Virginia v. Rives (1879), the Court used <b>mandamus</b> to order a {{criminal cases}} removed to federal court under the civil rights removal statute to be remanded back to state court, finding that the statute did not authorize federal jurisdiction because the bar on African-Americans serving on juries was not codified by statute or state constitution. In Ex parte Wall (1883), the Court denied a writ of <b>mandamus,</b> finding that it was proper to remove an attorney who participated in a lynch mob from a case.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mandamus</b> is {{the remedy}} where {{a lower court}} has clearly failed to issue {{compulsion}} to produce documents, or to allow the petitioner access to such documents as {{may be in the}} possession of the court or the parties to the action. <b>Mandamus</b> can be used to compel a court to enforce an order to answer interrogatories (questions submitted by the court or one of the parties to be answered under oath and pain of perjury).|$|E
25|$|The Taney Court {{also heard}} and {{rejected}} to petitions for <b>mandamus</b> in criminal cases. In Ex parte Taylor (1852), denied a petition on the merits, holding that federal bail in D.C. depended on federal law, not Maryland law. In Kentucky v. Dennison (1860), the Court denied another <b>mandamus</b> petition, holding that—even though the Extradition Clause of the Constitution obliged states to extradite criminals {{to other states}} for trial—this provision was not enforceable in the federal courts. Dennison was overruled by Puerto Rico v. Branstad (1987).|$|E
25|$|In 1835, King William IV {{brought a}} case against the Ouse Bank Commissioners {{regarding}} a <b>mandamus</b> writ issued in 1834 about the Eau Brink Cut and possible damages it caused to the King's Lynn harbour.|$|E
25|$|Because Marbury filed his {{petition}} for the writ of <b>mandamus</b> {{directly in the}} Supreme Court, the Court needed {{to be able to}} exercise original jurisdiction over the case in order to have the power to hear it.|$|E
25|$|Tramways case, (1914): {{in which}} the High Court {{considered}} {{the effect of the}} amendment. The Court refused to overule Whybrow and held that the amendments to s 31 were not effective to remove the constitutional availability of prohibition and <b>mandamus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Algerine was {{commissioned}} in April 1810 under Lieutenant John Aitken Blow. She served initially in the Downs. On 30 March 1811, Algerine, {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Thomas Greenwood, seized the smuggling vessel <b>Mandamus.</b> The account in the London Gazette refers to Algerine as a cutter.|$|E
25|$|The court's {{original}} jurisdiction {{is limited}} to cases of habeas corpus, <b>mandamus,</b> prohibition, and writs of actual innocence based on DNA or other biological evidence. It also has original jurisdiction in matters filed by the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission relating to judicial censure, retirement, and removal of judges.|$|E
25|$|To {{direct a}} public body fulfil a {{legitimate}} expectation, the court issues a mandatory order (also {{known as a}} <b>mandamus).</b> This is a prerogative order which commands a public body to perform a public duty, and {{is often used to}} compel public bodies to exercise the powers given to them.|$|E
25|$|The four {{applied to}} the High Court of Australia for writs of <b>mandamus</b> {{compelling}} several people, including Pearson, the Australian Electoral Officer for New South Wales, {{to appear before the}} court to show cause why they should not be ordered to register the four people. The court granted the writs, and the hearings were held on 16 and 17 February.|$|E
25|$|In {{all other}} cases, however, the Court has only appellate jurisdiction, {{including}} {{the ability to}} issue writs of <b>mandamus</b> and writs of prohibition to lower courts. It considers cases based on its original jurisdiction very rarely; almost all cases are brought to the Supreme Court on appeal. In practice, the only original jurisdiction cases heard by the Court are disputes between two or more states.|$|E
25|$|In February 1946, Heman Marion Sweatt, an African American man, {{applied to}} the University of Texas School of Law. He was denied {{admission}} because of race, and subsequently filed suit in Sweatt v. Painter (1950). The state had no law school for African Americans. Instead of granting Sweatt a writ of <b>mandamus</b> to attend the University of Texas, the trial court granted a continuance for six months to allow the state time to create a law school for blacks.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Marbury and Madison, the federal judges {{declared}} that commissions, signed and sealed by the President, were valid, although not delivered. I deemed delivery essential to complete a deed, which, {{as long as it}} remains {{in the hands of the}} party, is as yet no deed, it is in posse only, but not in esse, and I withheld delivery of the commissions. They cannot issue a <b>mandamus</b> to the President or legislature, or to any of their officers.|$|E
25|$|To enforce {{judicial}} decisions, the Constitution grants {{federal courts}} both criminal contempt and civil contempt powers. The court's summary punishment for contempt immediately overrides all other punishments {{applicable to the}} subject party. Other implied powers include injunctive relief and the habeas corpus remedy. The Court may imprison for contumacy, bad-faith litigation, and failure to obey a writ of <b>mandamus.</b> Judicial power includes that granted by Acts of Congress for rules of law and punishment. Judicial power also extends to areas not covered by statute. Generally, federal courts cannot interrupt state court proceedings.|$|E
25|$|Like its predecessor, the Supreme Court of the United States under Chief Justice Roger B. Taney {{exercised}} {{only limited}} appellate jurisdiction in criminal cases. Like its predecessor, it heard original habeas petitions, writs of error {{from the state}} courts, and certificates of division from the circuit courts. In addition, unlike its predecessor, the Court heard two writs of error from the territorial courts and three prerogative writs of <b>mandamus</b> and prohibition in criminal matters. The Court denied every petition for a prerogative writ that it received, habeas or otherwise.|$|E
25|$|A legal {{challenge}} was {{filed in the}} Superior Court of Essex County, contesting the fine imposed for a citizen's failure to get health insurance {{as well as the}} fine imposed for a failure to provide information on a tax return as to whether that citizen had health insurance. The judge dismissed the case upon a motion filed by an assistant to Attorney General Martha Coakley for failure to state a case upon which relief can be granted. A petition for a writ of <b>mandamus</b> to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC), ordering Essex Superior Court to vacate this dismissal on procedural grounds, the failure to provide trial by jury in a dispute over property as requested by the plaintiff, was denied by Associate Justice Spina. An appeal was then filed with the Massachusetts Appeals Court. A later petition for a writ of <b>mandamus</b> with the SJC was also denied, this time by Chief Justice Ireland. The Appeals Court then heard the appeal and declined to send the case back to Essex Superior Court for trial by jury based on their belief that no facts needed to be determined and therefore trial by jury in this case was not a protected right under either the US or Massachusetts Constitutions. The SJC declined to hear any further appeals.|$|E
25|$|Marshall first {{examined}} the Judiciary Act of 1789 {{and determined that}} the Act purported to give the Supreme Court original jurisdiction over writs of <b>mandamus.</b> Marshall then looked to Article III of the Constitution, which defines the Supreme Court's original and appellate jurisdictions (see Relevant Law above). Marbury had argued that the Constitution was only intended to set a floor for original jurisdiction that Congress could add to. Marshall disagreed and held that Congress {{does not have the}} power to modify the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction. Consequently, Marshall found that the Constitution and the Judiciary Act conflict.|$|E
25|$|In a {{judicial}} reminder, the Indian Supreme Court observed Sikhism and Jainism to be sub-sects or special faiths {{within the larger}} Hindu fold, and that Jainism is a denomination within the Hindu fold. Although the government of British India counted Jains in India as a major religious community right from the first Census conducted in 1873, after independence in 1947 Sikhs and Jains were not treated as national minorities. In 2005 the Supreme Court of India declined to issue a writ of <b>Mandamus</b> granting Jains {{the status of a}} religious minority throughout India. The Court however left it to the respective states to decide on the minority status of Jain religion.|$|E
25|$|However, {{notwithstanding}} the grant of original jurisdiction, the Court has, through the years, assigned to lower courts {{such as the}} Court of Appeals the power to hear petitions for certiorari, prohibition, <b>mandamus,</b> quo warranto and habeas corpus. As a result, the Court has considerable discretion to refuse to hear these petitions filed directly before {{it on the ground}} that such should have been filed instead with the Court of Appeals or the appropriate lower court. Nonetheless, cases that have attracted wide public interest or for which a speedy resolution is of the essence have been accepted for decision by the Supreme Court without hesitation.|$|E
25|$|Section 3 of the Courts and Legal Services Act amends the County Courts Act 1984 {{to allow}} the County Courts to award any remedy used by the High Court. There were several {{exceptions}} because {{the status of the}} County Courts made it illogical {{to allow the}}m to write orders of <b>mandamus</b> or certiorari. The new section also allows the Lord Chancellor to prohibit the County Courts from making certain other types of order, with these types to be introduced by Statutory Instrument. Again, these are orders which it would be illogical to allow the County Courts to write, such as Anton Piller orders or Mareva injunctions.|$|E
25|$|Freedom of {{religion}} is a fundamental right according to the Indian Constitution. The Constitution also suggests a uniform civil code for its citizens as a Directive Principle. This has not been implemented until now as Directive Principles are Constitutionally unenforceable. The Supreme Court has further held that the enactment of a uniform civil code all at once may be counter-productive to {{the unity of the}} nation, and only a gradual progressive change should be brought about (Pannalal Bansilal v State of Andhra Pradesh, 1996). In Maharishi Avadesh v Union of India (1994) the Supreme Court dismissed a petition seeking a writ of <b>mandamus</b> against the government to introduce a common civil code, and thus laid the responsibility of its introduction on the legislature.|$|E
25|$|The High Court of Kerala is {{the highest}} court in the Indian state of Kerala and in the Union Territory of Lakshadweep. It is {{headquartered}} at Kochi. Drawing its powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the High Court {{has the power to}} issue directions, orders and writs including the writs of habeas corpus, <b>mandamus,</b> prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari for ensuring the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution to citizens or for other specified purposes. The High Court is empowered with original, appellate and revisional jurisdiction in civil as well as criminal matters, and the power to answer references to it under some statutes. The High Court has the superintendence and visitorial jurisdiction over all courts and tribunals of inferior jurisdiction covered under its territorial jurisdiction.|$|E
