Ham sausage can be cured using a curing solution that is rubbed into the ham, and machines can perform this process. Ham sausage has a marbled appearance due to the ham and bacon pieces in it, which can be observed when the product is sliced. German ham sausage can be sliced and then grilled or fried, and is also used as an ingredient in soups and stews.|$|E

BPI had a rate of 36 positives for salmonella per 1,000 tests, compared to a rate of nine positives per 1,000 tests for other suppliers for the program. However, the program continued to source from BPI because its price was substantially lower than ordinary <b>meat</b> <b>trimmings,</b> saving about $1m a year for the program.Cargill, among the largest hamburger makers in the U.S., is a big buyer of the meat-based product from BPI for its patties, according to the Times.

40|$|Clostridium difficile can be {{isolated}} from the intestines of healthy pigs (10 %) at slaughter age. Contamination of meat during the slaughter process has been described for many intestinal bacteria, i. e. Salmonella. Since C. difficile spores could survive the recommended cooking temperatures for meat and infect the consumer, C. difficile contaminated meat could be a potential public health risk. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine to which level contamination of the carcasses occurs and whether the presence of C. difficile on carcasses of pigs changes during the slaughter process. Rectal samples, cork bore samples and swab samples were taken from carcasses at the beginning and the end of the slaughter process. To determine whether the prevalence of C. difficile on carcasses correlates with its presence in <b>meat,</b> pork <b>trimmings</b> were also collected. The samples were cultured with both quantitative and qualitative culture methods. C. difficile was not isolated from any of the carcasses or the pork trimmings with the quantitative culture method. Even with qualitative culture methods cork bore samples of a carcass from a pig that intestinally carried C. difficile were negative. With the qualitative culture method C. difficile was isolated from 28 (18 %) carcasses that were sampled with electrostatic cloths directly after stunning, but from none of the 163 carcasses that were sampled after chilling. C. difficile was cultured from two of the eight pork trimmings. The results of this study indicate that carcasses can be contaminated at the beginning of the slaughter process with C. difficile, although with very low numbers of spores, since the bacterium was only recovered from samples when qualitative culture methods were used. The procedures along the slaughterline are sufficient to remove C. difficile from the carcasses, because spores were not found on any of the carcasses that were sampled with electrostatic cloths after chilling. Further research is required to investigate the source of the contamination of the pork trimmings...|$|R

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to {{determine}} the water-binding capacity of each individual trimming in a multicomponent system. Three types of experimental cooked sausages (finely chopped luncheon sausage, coarsely chopped sausage and ring sausage with potato starch) were made of five different meat trimmings: two pork trimmings and two beef trimmings, and one beef trimming used as a replacer. The water-binding was determined by the Tuominen-Honkavaara method by stepwise addition of water (basic formulation and four water additions) to the formulations and determining the firmness by a consistometer. The water-binding of each trimming was obtained by replacing the trimming by an additional trimming. A total of 3 sausage types x 5 <b>meat</b> <b>trimmings</b> x 5 water levels giving 75 experimental batches of five kg each were made. The average water-binding values of the same meat trimming combination in each sausage type were practically the same, and therefore the total averages for the same meat trimming combinations of each of the three sausage types were used for the subsequent calculations. The determination of the water-binding values of the <b>meat</b> <b>trimmings</b> were solved by forming five equations with four unknowns each, and then solving the unknowns using Microsoft Excel's ‘Solver’ function. By this procedure it was possible to determine the water-binding of individual <b>meat</b> <b>trimmings</b> in sausage systems.

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the physicochemical characteristics of three formulations of smoked cooked linguiças, only differing in the lean meat used: (Formula 1 ― 100 % ostrich meat; Formula 2 ― 50 % ostrich meat + 50 % pork; and Formula 3 ― 50 % ostrich meat + 50 % chicken), elaborated with ostrich <b>meat</b> <b>trimmings.</b> The formulas showed slightly higher moisture content (62. 00 - 64. 41 %) than the maximum allowed in the legislation for cooked linguiças (60 %) (Brasil, 2000). However, their protein content (19. 99 - 22. 14 %) was at least 42 % higher than the minimum required level (14 %); the fat content (11. 82 - 14. 25 %) was less than half the maximum permitted level (35 %) in the same legislation, and at least 45 % less than three well-known smoked cooked linguiça brands commercialized in Brazil; and the energy value (194. 89 - 208. 19 Kcal%) was at least 31 % less than the same smoked linguiça brands; thus the three ostrich smoked linguiça formulas elaborated could be claimed "light" in fat content and energy value (European Union, 2006; Brasil, 2012).

Energy valorization can be obtained through the thermochemical processing of meat and bone meal or the use of waste animal fats for the production of biodiesel. More recently, new applications have been reported like the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates as alternative to plastics produced from petroleum. Other interesting valorization strategies are based on the hydrolysis of by-products to obtain added value products like bioactive peptides with relevant physiological effects as antihypertensive, antioxidant, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, etc. with promising applications in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industry.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} bacteriological characteristics and shelf life of three formulations of ostrich sausages (linguiças), only differing in lean meat percentage: Formula 1, 100 % ostrich meat; Formula 2, 75 % ostrich meat + 25 % pork; and Formula 3, 50 % ostrich meat + 25 % pork + 25 % chicken. All linguiças were vacuum-packed and stored at 5 ± 2 ºC. Mesophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria, sulfite-reducing Clostridia, coagulase-positive Staphylococci, and Escherichia coli were enumerated and Salmonella spp were isolated and identified. Initial mesophilic and psychotropic bacteria counts were high. During storage time, sulfite-reducing Clostridia, coagulase-positive Staphylococci, and Escherichia colicounts never reached the tolerance limit established by the Brazilian legislation. However, Salmonellawas isolated from a Formula 2 sample on day 1, therefore, it was considered inappropriate for consumption.

40|$|Blood meal, {{meat and}} bone meal. and feather meal {{are high in}} escape protein, {{relative}} to oil meals and forages. and increase performance when included in forage-based diets sufficient in rumen degradable protein. Two factors that influence the nutritive value of animal byproduct meals are processing conditions and raw materials. Renderers apply heat to drive off moisture. extract fat. and eliminate bacterial contamination from animal tissues. This cooking also denatures proteins. creating cross links and insoluble bonds within and between protein chains: enhancing resistance to microbial degradation in the rumen. However. processing at very high temperatures can limit the extent of enzymatic breakdown of proteins, reducing digestibility and absorption in the small intestine. Variable inputs (deadstock, tankage, <b>meat</b> <b>trimmings</b> and bones) contribute to the great diversity encountered in commercial meat and bone meals. Concentration of meat and bone meal components. specifically bone. hair, and lean tissues. influence protein quantity and quality. Bone content, exhibited through ash, is negatively correlated with crude protein, whereas hair is high in protein but poorly digested. Animal performance with meat and bone meal supplementation has been inconsistent, and may result from inadequate escape protein and(or) poor protein digestibility arising from raw materials or processing conditions. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine how processing temperature and composition of animal byproduct meals influence in vivo true protein digestibility and escape protein concentrations. and to compare in situ and in vitro ammonia release techniques for measuring escape protein...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} "The Influence of Genotype of Leptin Gene on Qualitative Characteristics of Beef" {{describes the}} effect of polymorphisms of gene of leptin on selected qualitative, morphometric and weight indicators of beef and carcass. The analysis was carried out on 333 bulls of Czech Fleckvieh, which were genotyped (by PCR/RFLP method) of chosen locus. This locus is associated with qualitative changes in beef according to previous foreign studies. The weight of carcass, fore and hind quarter of the right half of the carcass, {{the weight of the}} individual tissues (meat, bone, and fat) and the weight of main meaty parts from the right half of carcass were measured. Before the dissection chosen morphometric indicators were measured. After the dissection, a sample of the musculus longissimus lumborum et thoracis was taken and then analysed in the laboratory. Basic chemical composition (dry matter, fat content, protein, and ash), muscle fibers diameter and fatty acid profile was determined. In addition, pH, added water holding capacity, colour (CIE Lab colour coordinates) were analysed both for one-day post-mortem and after 14 days of ageing. The shear force (using the Warner-Bratzler probe) was evaluated at the same time intervals as for both raw and heat-treated samples by grilling. The studied LEP polymorphism had a statistically significant effect on the weight of the hot carcass, the weight of right half of carcass and fore and hind quarter. LEP polymorphism significantly affected the proportion of meat on the right half of carcass, the weight of the bones and total weight of the I. class meat, and the weight of the I. class meat in the fore quarter. Further, {{the effect of}} LEP polymorphism on the weight of boneless round, boneless chuck, plate, flank, rib, hind shank, and <b>meat</b> <b>trimmings</b> of fore quarter was found. In a group of morphometric indicators, the effect was significant on lengths of round, fullness of round and round circumference. In the case of chemical composition, the effect of LEP polymorphism on the intramuscular fat content was significant. From the qualitative indicators, the effect was significant on the pH value and added water holding capacity, both one-day post-mortem and after 14 days of ageing. In the case of tenderness, the effect on shear force of heat treated, non-aged meat was significant. From the indicators describing colour, a statistically significant effect on the indicator of lightness was found in the case of unconditioned meat and after 14 days of ageing the effect was significant on the indicator characterising yellow colour and the colour saturation. Determination of fatty acid profile was carried out by gas chromatography. The effects of studied polymorphism and differences between LEP genotypes were found in myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, linoleic, -linolenic, -linolenic, conjugated linoleic, eisocapentaenoic, docosatetraenoic, docosapentaenoic both n- 6 and n- 3 and docosahexaenoic acids. From aggregated indicators, the statistical significant effect of LEP polymorphims on PUFA content, omega- 3 fatty acids content, and omega- 6 /omega- 3 fatty acids ratio was found. In connection with other candidate gene loci influencing the quality of beef, the results of dissertation can be used in the preparation of breeding schemes aimed at the production of quality breeding animals, highlighting the higher quality standards of the produced meat...|$|E
40|$|Realizou-se três experimentos objetivando: (1) estudar os efeitos da substituição parcial de gordura por água, com utilização de 0, 6 % de uma mistura {{comercial}} (BEKAPLUS C 4 @) de carragena com tripolifosfato de sódio, em partes iguais, para reter a água; (2) avaliar a possibilidade de substituir, parcial ou totalmente, a carne de pernil por carne de paleta, e (3) quantificar a influência do método de congelamento criogênico versus convencional - das porções. Comparou-se a influência das modificações nas formulações e processos de fabricação de uma carne suína reestrurada, pré-cozida e congelada, através de análises físicas, químicas, sensoriais e de custos de matérias primas. Em linhas gerais, o processamento desenvolvido nessa pesquisa envolve a mistura de carne cortada em cubos a 1 °C, com adição de sal, tripolifosfato e gelo em escamas, até que ocorra uma intensa liberação de proteínas miofibrilares. Adiciona-se, então a carne moída, a 1 °C, e os demais ingredientes, misturando até que a massa atinja 5 °C, quando é adicionada a gordura e mais gelo. Mistura-se por mais 4 min., sem vácuo, e mais 1, 5 min. sob vácuo. O embutimento da massa é feito em envoltório de poliamida e o cozimento com elevação gradual da temperatura da água até o produto atingir 72 °C. O produto é, então, resfriado, fatiado, embalado à vácuo e armazenado a - 18 °C. As fatias são aquecidas em chapa elétrica a temperatura de 180 °C até atingirem a temperatura interna de 75 °C, antes das análises sensoriais, de cor e textura objetivas. Avaliou-se sensorialmente os tratamentos do experimento 1 através de teste triangular, onde verificou-se diferença (p 0, 05) nas medidas de LH (luminosidade), aH (teor de vermelho) e bH (teor de amarelo) entre os tratamentos A e B. Os valores TBA encontrados foram de 0, 5 e 0, 6 mg malonaldeídolkg de amostra para os tratamentos B e A respectivamente, não observando-se diferença significativa. A avaliação sensorial não revelou diferença significativa quanto a preferência em relação a suculência entre os tratamentos, que receberam pontuação média de 4, 68 (TratA) e 5, 74 (TratB), próximas do valor 5, considerado ideal. Também não houve diferença estatística para sabor e aceitação global, porém, o TratB obteve valores de avaliação um pouco superiores ao TratA. No experimento 2, estudou-se a substituição parcial e total da carne de pernil por carne de paleta, para reduzir os custos da formulação. Comparou-se três formulações contendo carragena, STP e água, denominadas tratamentos 1, 2 e 3. O Tratl contendo 100 % de carne de pernil suíno; o Trat 2 com 50 % carne de pernil e 50 % carne de paleta, e o Trat 3 com 100 % carne de paleta. Não houve diferenças (p> 0, 05) entre os tratamentos nas medldas de cor, exceto para a medida aH (p 0, 05) entre os tratamentos. Também não houve diferença (p. 0, 05) na aceitação das amostras, porém, o Trat 2 apresentou escores um pouco superiores aos demais. No experimento 3, estudou-se a influência do congelamento rápido criogênico, com gás de nitrogênio líquido (TratR), em comparação com o congelamento convencional (Trat C) em carne suína reestruturada, durante a estocagem em freezer a - 18 °C. Calculou-se as formulações dos dois tratamentos para serem isoprotéicas e com baixo teor de gordura, utilizando-se a mistura comercial de carragena e tripolifosfato. Não se detectou diferença (p> 0, 05) entre os tratamentos nas medidas de cor feitas nas porções pré-cozidas frias. Porém, após o aquecimento, observou-se diferenças (p 0, 05) entre os tratamentos, porém o Trat R apresentou valores menores tanto para o pico 1 como para a força máxima. Os valores TBA apresentaram aumento linear relativamente intenso nas três primeiras semanas e um aumento relativamente mais lento nas semanas seguintes. Os valores de TBA para o Trat R foram inferiores aos do Trat C. Não se detectou qualquer tendência de aumento ou redução de valores sensoriais quanto ao sabor que pudessem ser relacionados aos valores TBA. Three {{experiments were}} carried out with the following objectives: (1) to {{study the effects of}} partial replacement of fat by water using 0, 6 % of a commercial mixture (Bekaplus C 4 @) of carrageenan and sodium trypoliphosfate (stp) in equal parts; (2) to evaluate the possibility of partial and total replacement of boneless fresh pork ham by blade plus shoulder meat, and (3) to quantify the influence of two freezing methods - cryogenic versus conventional - on the restructured meat portions. The effects of these changes in fonnulation and processing of the restructured, precooked and frozen pork were compared through physical, chemical, sensorial and raw material cost analysis. In general tenns, the processing methods, developed in this research, involve the mixture of chunked meat (at 1 °C) with addition of salt, stp and flaked ice, until the release of a fair amount of myofibrilar proteins. Ground <b>meat</b> <b>trimmings</b> (at 1 °C) and the other ingredients were then added while mixing until the temperature of the meat reaches 5 C, when more flaked ice and fat trimmings are added. The meat batch is then mixed for another 4 min. with the blender (or tumbler) lid opened, and 1, 5 min. under vacuum. Stuffing is made in poliamide casings and the cooking process is done by gradual rise of the water temperature until the internal product reaches 72 °C. The product is then chilled, sliced, vacuum packed and kept at - 18 °C. The experiment 1 treatments were evaluated through a sensory analysis triangle test and later through a preference test for flavor, tenderness, juiciness and global acceptance. In the experiment 2, it was applied a difference test with a structured hedonic scale. In the experiment 3, a scale was used to measure the intensity of characteristic, strange, and rancid fat (WOF) taste throughout the frozen storage period. Objective color measurements of LH, aH and bH were made with a Minolta CR 300 colorimeter, and objective texture measurements of peak 1 and maximum force were determined with a TA. XT 2 / 25 texture system coupled with a burger punch device. In the experiment 1, two formulations with the same protein level, labeled treatments A and B, were compared. Treatment A was calculated to have 16 % fat and 65 % moisture, and Treat. B, with carrageenan and stp to have 8 % fat and 73 % moisture. There was a difference (p 0, 05) between treatments A and B, for LH (luminance), aH (redness), and bH (yellowness) values. The TBA number for treatments A and B were 0, 5 and 0, 6 mg malonaldehydelkg of sample, and no signifícant difference was found. No difference (p> 0, 05) was found for juiciness between A and B treatments, with scores of 4, 68 (A) and 5, 74 (B), close to 5, which was previously established as the most desirable score for this trait. Also, no signifícant differences were found for flavor and general acceptance, but Treat. B had slightly higher scores than Treat A. In the experiment 2, the partial and total replacement of ham by blade plus shoulder were intended to reduce formulation costs. Three formulations containing carrageenan, stp and water, were labeled treatments 1, 2 and 3. Treatment 1 had 100 % ofthe meat from ham; Treat. 2 had 50 % ofthe meat from ham and 50 % from blade plus shoulder, and Treat 3 had 100 % ofthe meat from blade plus shoulder. There were no differences (p> 0, 05) between treatments for color measurements of the non-heated samples, except for aH value (p< 0, 05). However, differences (p< 0, 05) were found for the LH and bH values measured on the heated samples. The objective analyses of texture have not shown any difference among treatments. Also, there was no detectable sensorial differences, but Treat 2 had slightly higher scores than the other two. In the experiment 3, the influence offast cryogenic freezing with liquid nitrogen gas (Treat. R) compared to the conventional freezing (Treat. C) on the restructured pork during frozen storage at - 18 °C was studied. The formulations for both treatments were calculated to have equal composition, with a low fat content and 0, 6 % of the commercial rnixture of carrageenan and stp. No differences (P. 0, 05) were found between treatments for the color measurements made on the non-heated samples, but differences (p 0, 05) between treatments in the objective texture analysis, but Treat. R showed smaller peak 1 and maximum force values. The TBA number showed strong linear increases in the fírst two weeks and slower increases in the following weeks. TBA numbers for Treat. R were lower than for Treat. C, but were not statistically compared. No trend of increase or reduction in the sensorial nevalution of flevor scores was detected that coyld be related to TBA numbers...|$|E
