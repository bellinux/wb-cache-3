40|$|There is {{a special}} class of <b>magic</b> <b>squares</b> that are called pan-diagonal <b>magic</b> <b>squares</b> among general <b>magic</b> <b>squares.</b> In this paper, we shall {{consider}} a classification of a subclass of pan-diagonal 8 × 8 <b>magic</b> <b>squares.</b> Key clues for the present investigation are the 4 -adic expansion of the entries of <b>magic</b> <b>squares</b> and the transformations of <b>magic</b> <b>squares</b> that are represented by the permutations of rows and columns of the <b>magic</b> <b>squares...</b>|$|R

25|$|Number puzzles {{appeared}} in {{newspapers in the}} late 19th century, when French puzzle setters began experimenting with removing numbers from magic squares. Le Siècle, a Paris daily, published a partially completed 9×9 <b>magic</b> <b>square</b> with 3×3 subsquares on November 19, 1892. It was not a Sudoku because it contained double-digit numbers and required arithmetic rather than logic to solve, but it shared key characteristics: each row, column and subsquare added up to the same number.|$|E
25|$|On July 6, 1895, Le Siècle rival, La France, refined {{the puzzle}} {{so that it}} was almost a modern Sudoku. It {{simplified}} the 9×9 <b>magic</b> <b>square</b> puzzle so that each row, column, and broken diagonals contained only the numbers 1–9, but did not mark the subsquares. Although they are unmarked, each 3×3 subsquare does indeed comprise the numbers 1–9 and the additional constraint on the broken diagonals leads to only one solution.|$|E

The most important text from that period is the Precious Mirror of the Four Elements by Chu Shih-chieh (fl. 1280–1303), dealing with the solution of simultaneous higher order algebraic equations using a method similar to Horner's method. The Precious Mirror also contains a diagram of Pascal's triangle with coefficients of binomial expansions through the eighth power, though both appear in Chinese works as early as 1100. The Chinese also made use of the complex combinatorial diagram known as the <b>magic</b> <b>square</b> and magic circles, described in ancient times and perfected by Yang Hui (AD 1238–1298).|$|E
25|$|There is a {{game that}} is {{isomorphic}} to tic-tac-toe, but on the surface appears completely different. It is called Pick15 or Number Scrabble. Two players in turn say a number between one and nine. A particular number may not be repeated. The game is won by the player who has said three numbers whose sum is 15. If all the numbers are used and no one gets three numbers that add up to 15 then the game is a draw. Plotting these numbers on a 3×3 <b>magic</b> <b>square</b> shows that the game exactly corresponds with tic-tac-toe, since three numbers will be arranged {{in a straight line}} if and only if they total 15.|$|E
25|$|The favoured form of both Mughal garden pavilions and mausolea (seen as a funerary form of pavilion) was the hasht bihisht which {{translates}} from Persian as 'eight paradises'. These were a square or rectangular planned buildings {{with a central}} domed chamber surrounded by eight elements. Later developments of the hasht bihisht divided the square at 45 degree angles {{to create a more}} radial plan which often also includes chamfered corners; examples of which can be found in Todar Mal's Baradari at Fatehpur Sikri and Humayun's Tomb. Each element of the plan is reflected in the elevations with iwans and with the corner rooms expressed through smaller arched niches. Often such structures are topped with chhatris (small pillared pavilions) at each corner. The eight divisions and frequent octagonal forms of such structures represent the eight levels of paradise for Muslims. The paradigm however was not confined solely to Islamic antecedents. The Chinese <b>magic</b> <b>square</b> was employed for numerous purposes including crop rotation and also finds a Muslim expression in the wafq of their mathematicians. Ninefold schemes find particular resonance in the Indian mandalas, the cosmic maps of Hinduism and Buddhism.|$|E
