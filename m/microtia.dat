5|$|Anomalies and malformations of the pinna are common. These {{anomalies}} include chromosome syndromes such as ring 18. Children {{may also}} present cases of abnormal ear canals and low ear implantation. In rare cases no pinna is formed (atresia), or is extremely small (<b>microtia).</b> Small pinnae can develop when the auricular hillocks do not develop properly. The ear canal can fail to develop {{if it does}} not channelise properly or if there is an obstruction. Reconstructive surgery to treat hearing loss is considered as an option for children older than five, with a cosmetic surgical procedure to reduce the size or change the shape of the ear is called an otoplasty. The initial medical intervention is aimed at assessing the baby's hearing and the condition of the ear canal, as well as the middle and inner ear. Depending on the results of tests, reconstruction of the outer ear is done in stages, with planning for any possible repairs {{of the rest of the}} ear.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microtia</b> is a {{congenital}} deformity where the pinna (external ear) is underdeveloped. A completely undeveloped pinna {{is referred to}} as anotia. Because <b>microtia</b> and anotia have the same origin, it can be referred to as microtia-anotia. <b>Microtia</b> can be unilateral (one side only) or bilateral (affecting both sides). <b>Microtia</b> occurs in 1 out of about 8,000-10,000 births. In unilateral <b>microtia,</b> the right ear is most commonly affected. It may occur as a complication of taking Accutane (isotretinoin) during pregnancy.|$|E
50|$|Aural atresia is the {{underdevelopment}} of {{the middle}} ear and canal and usually occurs in conjunction with <b>microtia.</b> Atresia occurs because patients with <b>microtia</b> may not have an external opening to the ear canal, though. However, the cochlea and other inner ear structures are usually present. The grade of <b>microtia</b> usually correlates to the degree of development {{of the middle}} ear.|$|E

50|$|Anotia ("no ear") {{describes}} a rare congenital deformity {{that involves the}} complete absence of the pinna, the outer projected portion of the ear, and narrowing or absence of the ear canal.

5000|$|Ear augmentation, {{addressing}} <b>Microtia</b> (underdeveloped pinna) and Anotia (absent pinna) involves adding {{structural elements}} {{to replace the}} missing structures.

50|$|Because {{the middle}} and inner ears are {{necessary}} for hearing, people with complete agenesis of the ears are totally deaf.

5000|$|The {{congenital}} defect <b>microtia,</b> deformed or unformed outer ear, can {{be associated with}} partial or complete conductive deafness, depending upon the severity of the deformity and whether the middle ear is also affected.

50|$|John Reinisch is an American {{physician}} {{specializing in}} plastic surgery. He is {{a pioneer in}} the field of pediatric plastic surgery, and developed the Medpor method of ear reconstruction for treatment of <b>microtia.</b> He founded the division of plastic surgery at Children's Hospital Los Angeles in 1983 and was also chairman of the division of plastic surgery at the University of Southern California, where he remains on the faculty. He is currently the director of Craniofacial and Pediatric Plastic Surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and a plastic surgeon at Cedars-Sinai Medical Group. He is also director of the Center for Ear Reconstruction. He developed many of the techniques currently in use for treatment of <b>microtia,</b> cleft lip and palate, wound care, post operative pain relief, vascular and pigmented birth marks, and the use of tissue expansion in children. He has an international practice that was built in part on his early adoption of the use of telemedicine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Microtia</b> — A {{congenital}} defect characterized {{by either the}} severe underdevelopment or {{the absence of the}} pinna (outer ear). At one end of the spectrum is a pinna slightly smaller than normal, but of normal appearance, and {{at the other end of}} the spectrum is anotia, the absence of the pinna. The Nagata classiﬁcation correlates the ear deformity with the surgical approach thus: (i) Lobule type — The patient has an ear remnant and malpositioned lobule, but no concha, acoustic meatus, or tragus. (ii) Concha type — The patients presents an ear remnant, malpositioned earlobe, concha (with or without acoustic meatus), tragus, and antitragus with an incisura intertragica. (iii) Small concha type — The patient presents an ear remnant, malpositioned lobule, and a small indentation instead of a concha. (iv) Anotia — The patient presents either no ear remnant, or a minute, ear remnant. (v) Atypical <b>microtia</b> — The patient presents deformities of the ear that are not comprehended in the four preceding Nagata classifications.|$|E
