25|$|Degradation during service life, {{or after}} {{careless}} disposal, is a chemical change that drastically reduces the {{average molecular weight}} of the polyvinyl chloride polymer. Since the mechanical integrity of a plastic depends on its high average molecular weight, wear and tear inevitably weakens the material. Weathering degradation of plastics results in their surface embrittlement and <b>microcracking,</b> yielding microparticles that continue on in the environment. Also known as microplastics, these particles act like sponges and soak up Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) around them.

25|$|Attempts at {{repair of}} ischaemic-damaged bone will usual occur in 2 phases. First, when dead bone abuts live marrow, {{capillaries}} and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells grow into the dead marrow spaces, while macrophages degrade dead cellular and fat debris. Second, mesenchymal cells differentiate into osteoblasts or fibroblasts. Under favorable conditions, layers of new bone {{form on the}} surface of dead spongy trabeculae. If sufficiently thickened, these layers may decrease the radiodensity of the bone; therefore, the first radiographic evidence of previous osteonecrosis may be patchy sclerosis resulting from repair. Under unfavorable conditions repeated attempts at repair in ischaemic conditions can be seen histologically and are characterized by extensive delamination or <b>microcracking</b> along cement lines as well as the formation of excessive cement lines. Ultimate failure of repair mechanisms due to persistent and repeated ischaemic events is manifested as trabecular fractures that occur in the dead bone under functional load. Later followed by cracks and fissures leading to structural collapse of the area involved (osteocavitation).|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{crack tip}} region in an elastic {{composite}} can be separated into three different regions. {{based on a}} simple rate-independent phenomenological constitutive model, the path independence of the J-integral {{and the concept of}} cracktip shielding, the maximum radii R of the damage saturation zone is obtained. Damage isotropy in the largest saturated damage zone is expressed by utilizing the Monte-Carlo technique to create the uniform distributions of <b>microcrack</b> location and orientation. With the assumption of dilute <b>microcrack</b> concentration, interaction among <b>microcracks</b> are neglected, and the stress intensity factor produced by interaction between main-crack and each <b>microcrack</b> can be superposed. Two sources of loading are analyzed, one is for the main-crack <b>microcrack</b> interaction under an applied remote load, and the other is for the main-crack <b>microcrack</b> interaction accompanied by the relief of residual stresses on the <b>microcrack</b> surfaces. The results show that two sources of loading can shield the main-crack tip, and <b>microcracks</b> behind the main-crack tip can make the most shielding whereas <b>microcracks</b> ahead of the main-crack tip play no role in shielding...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to develop three-dimensional numerical models to predict transport properties of concrete from its internal structure. The models relate the macroscopic transport property to internal structure of concrete so {{a better understanding of}} the influence of microstructure, especially <b>microcracks,</b> on transport properties can be obtained. Diffusivity of concrete is modelled by combining a digitised mesostructure and finite difference algorithm. This allows the determination of the effect of <b>microcracks,</b> ITZ and aggregate shape on the diffusivity of mortar and concrete. The limitation of this approach in modelling very small features (several micrometres) is discussed. A finite element technique is coupled with aligned meshing approach to study the effect of <b>microcracks</b> on the diffusivity of concrete. <b>Microcracks</b> are incorporated as interface elements. New information regarding the effect of <b>microcrack</b> properties such as width, density, diffusivity and percolation on overall diffusivity of concrete is obtained. The transport model is then combined with a mechanical model to investigate the effect of tensile load-induced <b>microcracks</b> on diffusivity. In doing so, the mechanical model is used to simulate the formation and propagation of <b>microcracks</b> due to tensile loading which is then used as an input to the transport model. A similar technique is applied to investigate the effect of <b>microcracks</b> on the permeability of concrete. The simulations show the influence of <b>microcrack</b> properties such as width, density and percolation on overall permeability of concrete. The difference between the effect of <b>microcracks</b> on permeability and diffusivity is discussed. Capillary absorption of concrete is modelled by using a Lattice-Network approach in which unsaturated flow is simulated using a non-linear finite element method. The model is employed to evaluate the effect of heterogeneities produced by aggregate particles and <b>microcracks</b> on the sorptivity of concrete. Open Acces...|$|R

In this study, in vivo <b>microcracks</b> in human ribs were bulk-stained in basic fuchsin and viewed in longitudinal section and in 3 dimensions using 2 different computer-based methods of reconstruction: (1) serial sectioning of methylmethacrylate embedded sections using a sledge macrotome and identification of <b>microcracks</b> using UV epifluorescence followed by computerised reconstruction of <b>microcracks</b> using software and (2) laser scanning confocal microscopy of thick sections followed by reconstruction of <b>microcracks</b> into a 3 -D image. The size and shape of <b>microcracks</b> were found to be similar using both techniques. Both techniques of reconstruction showed <b>microcracks</b> to be approximately elliptical in shape. From the serial sectioning reconstructions (n = 9), <b>microcracks</b> were found to have a mean length of 404 +/- 145 microm (mean +/- S. D.)

However, the phenomenon of <b>microcrack</b> formation is difficult to capture experimentally. Therefore, this paper presents a finite element (FE) model to simulate the <b>microcrack</b> formation during orthogonal cutting. The model has been validated by performing orthogonal micro-cutting experiments and error in cutting force prediction is less than 11. 5 %. The simulation helps identify locations at which <b>microcracks</b> are formed in the shear zone using the mathematical and FEA models. Furthermore, {{the contribution of the}} specific energy (energy/volume) associated with the <b>microcrack</b> formation to the total specific energy of the shear zone has been evaluated.

Because <b>microcracks</b> in concrete structure are the preferential ingression channels for aggressive ions, e. g., chloride, sulphate, etc. However, <b>microcracks</b> have potentials to self-heal autogenously due to the continuous hydration of unhydrated cement, especially when ultra-/ high strength concrete is used. To quantify the autogenous self-healing effects of <b>microcracks</b> in cement paste, our experiment is designed to monitor the self-healing process of <b>microcracks</b> in cement paste continuously by using optical microscope.
