5|$|Although the F-35B {{is fully}} capable of {{performing}} vertical landing, {{in a similar}} fashion to the way that the Harrier and Sea Harrier operated, this <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> places limitations on the loads that the aircraft is capable of returning to the ship with. As a consequence, to avoid the costly disposal at sea of both fuel and munitions, the Royal Navy is developing the Shipborne rolling vertical landing (SRVL) technique for its operation of the Lightning II. SRVL is a hybrid landing technique that uses the Lightning's vectored thrust capability to slow its forward speed to around 70 knots to allow it to make a rolling landing, using its disc brakes, without the need of an arrestor wire. A special type of metallic 'thermal paint' is being developed to withstand temperatures of up to 1,500C in the vicinity of jet nozzles.|$|E

25|$|The Bizon uses {{a simple}} {{straight}} blowback <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> an unlocked breech system reduces cost and build complexity. The Bizon's operating cycle {{is characterized by}} a very short recoil stroke, standard 9×18mm ammunition will only drive the bolt partially {{to the rear of the}} receiver and produces a cyclic rate of 700 rounds/min. High-impulse ammunition forces the bolt to travel all the way to the end of the receiver, barely striking the receiver wall. A rate of fire of 650–680 rounds/min is the result. This has the effect of reducing perceived recoil and increasing controllability and hit probability.|$|E

25|$|To change up a gear, {{the lever}} is pushed forward (against a spring pressure) towards the +, {{and to change}} down, the lever is pulled {{rearward}} towards the −. The DSG transmission can now be operated with the gear changes being (primarily) determined by the driver. This <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> is commonly called tiptronic. In the interests of engine preservation, when accelerating in Manual/tiptronic mode, the DSG will still automatically change up just before the redline, and when decelerating, it will change down automatically at very low revs, just before the engine idle speed (tickover). Furthermore, if the driver calls for a gear {{when it is not}} appropriate (e.g., requesting a downshift when engine speed is near the redline) the DSG will not change to the driver's requested gear.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{examples of}} this device were from {{the first half of}} the nineteenth century in the silver mining area of the Harz mountains, Germany, where they were driven by cranks connected to water wheels, although bucket hoists ("Hakenkunst") using the same <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> had been used in Swedish iron mines since the 17th century. They appear to have evolved from an informal modification to the beam pumps, where the miners used spikes stuck into the wooden pump rods to get themselves carried up the shaft. As beam pumps were universal in deep mines, it was a then simple development to make proper platforms to carry the miners. The first formal engine was installed in 1833 at a mine at Clausthal, Lower Saxony, where inspector Wilhelm Albert and manager Georg Dörell (1793–1854) fastened foot platforms and hand-holds to adjacent, reciprocating pump rods, using a waterwheel-driven pump put out of use when a new drainage adit was made at a lower level. The 1837 man engine at the Samson Pit in Sankt Andreasberg in the same region is still in use, although converted from water to electric power in 1922.|$|E

500|$|... "Good Vibrations" [...] {{established}} a new <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> for Wilson. Instead {{of working on}} whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or [...] "modules").

[...] Brian acknowledged: [...] "We had done about six months work on another thing, but we jumped and ended up doing the entire thing here at the house with an entirely different mood and approach than what we originally started out with."

2500|$|NIF is {{designed}} primarily {{to use the}} indirect drive <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> in which the laser heats a small metal cylinder instead of the capsule inside it. The heat causes the cylinder, known as a hohlraum (German for [...] "hollow room", or cavity), to re-emit the energy as intense X-rays, which are more evenly distributed and symmetrical than the original laser beams. Experimental systems, including the OMEGA and Nova lasers, validated this approach through the late 1980s. In {{the case of the}} NIF, the large delivered power allows for the use of a much larger target; the baseline pellet design is about 2mm in diameter, chilled to about 18 kelvins (−255°C) and lined with a layer of frozen deuterium-tritium (DT) fuel.
