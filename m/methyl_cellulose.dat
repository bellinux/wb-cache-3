These polymers have always been considered to weakly adsorb (via physical adsorption forces) on gangue minerals and consequently the adsorption is considered to be an equilibrium process and therefore reversible. Micro-scale flotation tests on a talc sample showed that the floatability of the talc could be completely reduced by the adsorption of these polysaccharides but could be restored, depending on the conditions, by washing with water showing that the adsorption is reversible in a pure water system.

Monomer composition and methyl distribution in the polymer chain were analyzed after total or partial random hydrolysis and appropriate derivatization with gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS), respectively, and used as reference data. The same MCs were then hydrolyzed with an enzyme preparation of Trichoderma longibrachiatum and further investigated with size-exclusion chromatography with multiangle light scattering and refractive index detection (SEC-MALS/RI) and MS. Electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) in combination with various MS analyzers were compared with respect to quantification of the degradation products directly and after perdeuteriomethylation. The methyl group distribution in the oligomeric fractions and the average DS as a function of chain length were calculated from ESI mass spectra.

40|$|The Common Cold {{remains the}} most {{frequent}} symptomatic viral infection in man. Current best therapies are all symptomatic. New pharmacological therapies {{are likely to be}} prescription-bound, and as most Common Cold infections are successfully treated without the intervention of a Physician, {{there is a need for}} effective non-prescription therapy options. Aim of this study is to propose a new type of approach, based on the concept of making a hostile biological environment for virus survival and spreading at the point of infection, the nasopharynx. The hypothesis was advanced that infections could be controlled using a physical biological approach to create an environment at the point of infection, that is inhibitory to the survival, and persistence of infecting virus, and of viruses newly released from infected mucosal epithelial cells. A nasal irrigation spray, designed to deliver a low pH gel to the nasal cavity, was developed and tested in this study. The study was a randomised, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of three formulations of irrigation nasal spray in 441 subjects. The objective was to test whether the formulations reduced Cold severity and Cold duration compared to a placebo nasal spray. Subjects were recruited, and supplied with the product when healthy, and were instructed to begin treating and recording symptom severity once they experienced the "first signs" of a Common Cold. To qualify, subjects had to volunteer that they had at least one of the symptoms: sore/scratchy throat, runny nose or congested nose. The product was used 4 times daily, with at least 4 hours separating each dose, for a maximum of 7 days. Efficacy was assessed by an Interactive Voice Recall System whereby subjects were required to contact the investigation site, by telephone, twice daily when they were asked to assess the severity of their symptoms using a four point ordinal scale where 0 = "absent", and 3 = "severe". The symptoms assessed were sore throat, runny nose, blocked nose, cough and tired/run-down feeling. Two formulations demonstrated significant effects. A hydroxy <b>methyl</b> propyl <b>cellulose</b> based formulation reduced symptom severity compared with placebo by 17 % and a Poloxamer based formulation reduced severity by 21 %.

The mean particle size of drug loaded pellets was in the range 1018 to 1065 mm. SEM photographs and calculated sphericity factor confirms that the prepared formulations were spherical in nature. The drug loaded pellets were stable and compatible as confirmed by DSC and FTIR studies. XRD patterns revealed the crystalline nature of pure clozapine. Loose surface crystal study indicated that crystalline clozapine was observed in all formulation and more clear in formulation A 5.

Our comparative studies show that the alcoholysis of cellulose in methanol or ethanol proceeds more efficiently than the hydrolysis of cellulose in water medium.

40|$|Grape is {{considered}} as a non-climacteric fruit, the maturation of which is independent of ethylene. However, previous work had shown that ethylene is capable of affecting the physiological processes during maturation of grape berries. Experiments were designed to screen the gene pool affected by ethylene at the ripening inception in Cabernet Sauvignon berries. The results showed that only 73 of 14 562 genes of microarray slides were significantly modulated by a 24 -h ethylene treatment (4 ml l 21), performed 8 weeks after flowering. The study then focused on accumulation of several mRNAs affected by ethylene {{in relation to the}} berry size. Indeed, we observed that ethylene application at ve´ raison led to a berry diameter increase. This increase is mainly because of sap intake and cell wall modifications, enabling cell elongation. This was related to changes in the expression pattern of many genes, classified in two groups: (1) ‘water exchange’ genes: various aquaporins (AQUA) and (2) ‘cell wall structure’ genes: polygalacturonases, xyloglucan endotransglucosylases (XTH), pectin <b>methyl</b> esterases, <b>cellulose</b> synthases and expansins. The expression patterns were followed either along berry development or in three berry tissues (peel, pulp and seeds). Ethylene stimulates the accumulation of most gene transcripts in 1 h, and in several parts of the berry, this stimulation may last for 24 h in some cases. One XTH and one AQUA seem to be good candidates to explain the ethylene-induced berry expansion.

40|$|We {{report the}} ability to detect with high {{sensitivity}} sporadic mutations using a mutation scanning assay, which employs thermostable endonuclease V (EndoV) and DNA ligase. The products of the mutation scanning assay were separated using microchip capillary electrophoresis (mu CE) and detected with a dual-color laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detector. PCR products from mutant and wild-type DNA of p 53 exon 8 were generated using Cy 3 -labeled forward and Cy 5 -labeled reverse primers to allow LIF detection with mCE. EndoV recognizes and primarily cleaves heteroduplexed DNA one base 30 to a mismatch and can nick matched sites at low levels as well. DNA ligase is used to reseal nicks generated at matched sites, which creates a highly sensitive and specific assay for analyzing sporadic mutations in genomic DNA. Heteroduplexed DNA samples were treated with EndoV alone and with both EndoV and DNA ligase and separated using a 4 % (w/v) linear polyacrylamide gel constituted in 1 x TTE buffer, 7 M urea, and 0. 05 % (w/v) <b>methyl</b> hydroxyethyl <b>cellulose,</b> which was used to suppress the EOF in the microchip.
