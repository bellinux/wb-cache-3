40|$|Abstract Background Exercise induces {{changes in}} several organs and tissues, and this process {{might be due}} to {{oxidative}} damage caused by free radicals and inflammatory mediators. <b>Methyl</b> <b>Sulphonyl</b> <b>Methane,</b> better known as MSM, is a naturally occurring sulphur compound with well-known antioxidant properties. On the other hand, Vitamin C is important in limiting free radical damage in the aqueous phase of the cell, and cellular vitamin C status may be linked to the mechanisms involved in quenching cellular reactive oxygen species. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if supplementation with MSM and vitamin C could alleviate exercise-induced oxidative stress in horses undergoing jumping competition. Methods Twenty four jumping horses involved in competition were used. Horses were given the following three treatment diets: control (without supplementation), MSM 8 mg/kg, and combined supplements (MSM 8 mg/kg + Vit-C 5 mg/kg). EDTA blood samples were collected before exercise, upon arrived to the schooling area (control), and each week after last show. Nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, lipid hydroperoxides and the antioxidant enzymes, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase and glutathione reductase, plasma levels were determined. Results Competition induced a significant increase in lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide and carbon monoxide. By contrary, reduced glutathione as well as antioxidant enzyme activities, were decreased. MSM administration significantly ameliorated all these exercise-related changes, and this effect was potentiated by Vit C reaching values in some of the parameters similar to those found before competition. Conclusion These results suggest that jumping exercise could induce harmful effects on horses, probably due to an increase in oxidative damage and proinflammatory molecules. In addition, we have demonstrated that MSM could exert some protective effect on oxidative and inflammatory exercise-induced injury. </p...|$|E

MCSE hydrolyzed casein {{with the specific}} activity of 0. 780 â€Šunits/mg per min. Interestingly, it enhanced the clot formation process of citrated human plasma from control 146 to 432 â€Šs. In addition, the intravenous injection of MCSE significantly prolonged the bleeding time in a dose-dependent manner from control 150 to more than 800 â€Šs, and strengthened its anticoagulant activity. Interestingly, MCSE specifically prolonged the clotting time of only activated partial thromboplastin time, but not prothrombin time, and revealed the participation of MCSE in the intrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade. Furthermore, MCSE completely hydrolyzed both AÎ± and BÎ² chains of the human fibrinogen and partially hydrolyzed the Î³ chain. However, it hydrolyzed all the chains (Î± polymer, Î± chain, Î² chain and Î³-Î³ dimmers) of partially cross-linked human fibrin clot.

In this study, we have investigated the presence of proteolytic activity directed against insulin-like growth factor binding protein- 1 (IGFBP- 1) in pregnancy. In addition, the effect of protease activity on IGFBP- 1 immunoreactivity and IGF binding was characterised. 125 I-IGFBP- 1 was incubated with maternal and foetal serum, amniotic fluid and placental extracts. Breakdown of 125 I-IGFBP- 1 was determined by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The size distribution of endogenous IGFBP- 1 was determined by Western immunoblotting. Protease inhibitor studies characterised the proteolytic activity, and Western ligand blotting with 125 I-IGF-I {{was used to determine}} IGF binding capacity of proteolysed IGFBP- 1. Amniotic fluid samples collected after labour onset contained proteolytic activity that generated 12 - and 19 -kDa IGFBP- 1 fragments that did not bind to 125 I-IGF-I.

40|$|A {{detailed}} product {{study has}} been performed on the OH radical initiated oxidation of dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) under different conditions of temperature, partial pressure of O 2 and NO x concentration. The products of the OH radical initiated oxidation of DMS have been investigated under NO x free conditions at temperatures of 284, 295 and 306 ± 2 K and the O 2 partial pressures of 20, 200 and 500 mbar. The major identified sulphur-containing products were DMSO, SO 2 and methane sulphonic acid (MSA). Evidence has been found {{for the formation of}} methane sulphinic acid (MSIA) in considerable yield. Formation of methane thiol formate (MTF) and carbonyl sulphide (OCS) has been also observed. The variation of the formation yield of DMSO and SO 2 with temperature and O 2 partial pressure {{has been found to be}} consistent with a mechanism involving both addition and abstraction channels of the initial reaction. The found formation yields of DMSO for 284 K (46. 3 ± 5. 0 %), 295 K (34. 8 ± 7. 6 %) and 306 K (24. 4 ± 2. 8 %), at 200 mbar O 2, give evidence for the predominance of the addition pathway at low temperature. High overall molar formation yields of SO 2, about 90 % at all temperatures, leads to the conclusion that further oxidation of the products in both the addition and abstraction channels results mainly in SO 2 production under the experimental conditions of this study. The major sulphur-containing products identified in the presence of NO x were SO 2, DMSO, dimethyl sulphone (DMSO 2), MSA, <b>methane</b> <b>sulphonyl</b> peroxy nitrate (MSPN) and OCS. The variation of the product yields with NO x concentration at different temperatures was also found to be consistent with the occurrence of both addition and abstraction channels. It was found that increasing the initial NO concentration depresses the DMSO, SO 2 and OCS formation yields and enhances those of DMSO 2, MSA and MSPN. The branching ratio for DMSO formation was found to decrease with increasing initial NO and to decrease with increase of the temperature. This behaviour is expected for a reaction sequence involving formation of a thermally unstable peroxy radical adduct and its subsequent reaction with NO with formation of an oxy-alcoxy species which can react with molecular O 2 to form DMSO 2. The molar formation yield of SO 2 was found to decrease with increasing both the temperature and initial NO x. A study of the gas phase oxidation of DMSO by OH radicals has been performed under conditions similar to those for DMS. Formation of MSIA in a very high yield was found. The results show quite definitely that MSIA is the major oxidation product of DMSO and that its measured yield is independent of the reaction conditions. Formation of DMSO 2, SO 2, MSA and MSPN has been observed. The observed behaviour of these products supports a formation mechanism involving secondary chemistry of MSIA initiated either by OH or by peroxy radicals...|$|R
40|$|The {{various groups}} {{into which the}} triterpenes are divided are defined and {{emphasis}} is placed on the structural relationships which exist between these groups. A brief description is given of the methods used in the determination of the structure of triterpenes with particular reference to β-asyrin (I), a member of the oleanane (II) group. Recent progressin the problems of biogenesis and the total synthesis of triterpenes is reviewed. All approaches, so far investigated, to the synthesis of pentacyclic triterpenes involve the fusion of two bicyclic moities representing rings A and B and rings D and E of the proposed structure. This thesis describes attempts to synthesise pentacyclic triterpenes of the oleanane (II) group, via the tetracyclic-cis-ketone (IIIa), the tetracyclic-trans-ketone (IIIc) or the tetracyclic-αβ-unsaturated-ketone (IVa). The important bicylic intermediates in these syntheses are 5 -(2 '-bromoethyl) - 6 -exomethylene- 1, 1, 10 -trimethyl-trans-decaline(Va), 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-cis-decal- 2 -one (VI) and 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one (VII); the preparation of the last two compounds has been reported previously by Halsall and Thomas. It was proposed originally to obtain the racemic modification of 5 -(2 '-bromoethyl) - 6 -exomethylene- 1, 1, 10 -tri- methyl-trans-decalin from Δ-podocarpen- 7 -one (VIII), the synthesis of which requires large amounts of 2, 2, 6 -trimethyl- cyclohexanone. A rapid technique was developed for the preparation of this compound in high yield from 2 -methylcyclo- hexanone. The availability of sclareol (IX), which is a suitable relay in the synthesis of (+) - 5 -(2 '-bromoethyl) - 6 - exomethylene- 1, 1, 10 -trimethyl-trans-decalin (Va) led to the abandonment of the route via Δ-podocarpen- 7 -one. Oxidation of sclareol with potassium permaganate gave the enol-ether (X). Ozonolysis of the enol-ether (X), followed by decomposition of the Oozonide (XI) with Raney nickel and reduction of the product with lithium aluminium hydride gave a mixture of 5 -(2 '-hydroxyethyl) - 6 -hydroxy- 1, 1, 6, 10 - tetramethyl-trans-decalin (XII) and 5 -(2 '-hydroxyethyl) - 6 - exomethylene- 1, 1, 10 -trimethyl-trans-decalin (Vb). Treatment of either of these compounds with phosphorus oxybromide in pyridine gave (+) - 5 -(2 '-bromoethyl) - 6 -exomethylene- 1, 1, 10 -trimethyl-trans- decalin (Va), from which ambreinolide (XXIII) was prepared. The crude product, obtained after decomposing the ozonide (XI) with Raney nickel, was reduced with sodium borohydride but only small yields of compounds, which could be characterised were obtained. These were 5 -(2 '-hydroxyethyl- 6 -acetoxy- 1, 1, 6, 10 -tetramethyl-trans-decalin, 5 -carboxymethyl- 6 -acetoxy- 1 - 1 - 6 - 10 -tetramethyl-trans-decalin and the lactone derived from 5 -carboxymethyl- 6 -hydroxy- 1, 1, 6,, 10 -tetramethyl- trans-decaline. The first two of these compounds were obtained also by catalytic hydrogenation of the ozonide (XI); the lactone was the only compound isolated from the product obtained by oxidising the enol-ether (X) with sodium metaperiodate/ osmium tetroxide. It has been predicted on theoretical grounds that that 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-cis-decal- 2 -one (VI) should enolise towards C - 3. Alkylation of this compound with ethyl iodide gave 3 -ethyl- 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-cis-decal- 2 -one, from which a mixture of 3 -ethyl- 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-Δ-cis-octal- 2 -one and 3 -ethyl- 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one was obtained by brominating and dehydrobrominating. 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl— cis-decal- 2 -one (VI) was brominated in several ways and the crude product was dehydrobrominated to give, in all cases, a mixture of 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-Δ-cis-octal- 2 -one and 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl- Δ-octal- 2 -one. The implications from the results of the alkylation and bromination/dehydrobromination experiments are discussed. Alkynation of (±) - 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one (VII) with (+) - 5 -(2 -bromoethyl) — 6 -exomethylene- 1, 1, 10 -trimethyl- trans-decalin (Va) gave a mixture of the tetracyclic-αβ-unsaurated ketones (IVa and b). A second product was obtained from this alkylaqtion and may be a mixture of the isomeric tetracyclic-βδ-unsaturated- ketones (XIIIa and b). The tetracyclic-αβ-unstaurated- ketones (IVa and b) were reduced with lithium in liquid ammonia to give the tetracyclic-trans-ketones (IIIc and d) this mixture was resolved. The C, 30 -alcohols (XIVa and/or b) were prepared from the tetracylic-trans-ketones (IIIc and/or d) and lithium methyl, and they were treated with boron trifluoride etherate. A hydrocarbon (or mixture of hydrocarbons } was obtained and was stable to further treatment with acid. Possible products of this series of reactions are oleon- 18 -ene (IV) and 18 βH-olean- 12 —one (XVI); neither of these compounds was isolated. The tetracyclic-hydrocarbons (XVIIa and b) were obtained by treating the tetracyclic-αβ-unsaturated-ketones (IVa and b) with methyl magnesium iodide. Spectroscopic analysis of the product obtained by treating the tetracyclic- hydrocarbons (XVIIa and b) with boron trifluoride etherate, fluoroboric acid or aluminium trichloride in nitromethane indicated that the yields of olean- 11 (12), 13 (18) -diene (XVIII) (one of the expected products of this series of reactions) was greater than that obtained from the tetracyclic-allylic-alcohols (XIXa and b) by Corey and co-workers, who used acetic acid saturated with hydrogen chloride as the cyclising agent. An investigation was made into the stability of the conjugated diene system in 3 β-bezoyl-olean- 11 (12 }, 13 (18) -diene to treatment with acid. An attempt was made to prepare (+) - 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl- Δ-octal- 2 -one (XX) for use in the alkynation with (+) - 5 -(2 '-bromoethyl- 6 -exomethylene- 1, 1, 10 -trimethyl-trans- decalin (Va). Only partial resolution of (±) - 7, 7, 10 -tri- methyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one (VII) was achieved using standard procedures. 10 -Carbethoxy- 7, 7,dimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one (XXIa) has been resolved and in the present work the racemic modification of this compound. was converted into 7, 7, 10 -tri- methyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one by two routes. It is possible therefore, to obtoin the optical isomers of 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl- Δ-octal- 2 -one (VII) by an indirect method. The carbonyl group was protected by preparing the dioxolane-derivative (XXIIa), which was reduced with lithium aluminium hydride to give 10 -hydroxymethyl- 7, 7 -dimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one- 2 -dioxolane (XXIIb). In naming dioxolane derivatives in this abstract it is assumed that the double bond is in the Δ position; no evidence was obtained to confirm this. 10 -Methanesulphonyloxymethyl- 7, 7 -dimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one- 2 - dioxolane (XXIIc) was prepared by treating 10 -hydroxymethyl- 7, 7,-dimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one- 2 -dioxolane (XXIIb) with <b>methane</b> <b>sulphonyl</b> chloride. the two routets to 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-Δ- octal- 2 -one diverge at this stage. In the first method 10 -methanesulphonyloxymethyl- 7, 7 -dimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one- 2 - dioxolane (XXIIc) was converted to the dioxolane-methanethiol (XXIId), which without purification, was desulphurised with hydrazine. The dioxolane protecting group was removed from the product and 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one was obtained. In the second method 10 -methanesulphonyloxymethyl- 7, 7 -dimethyl- Δ-octal- 2 -one- 2 -dioxolane (XXIIc) was converted to 10 -iodomethyl- 7, 7 -dimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one- 2 -dioxolane (XXIIe), which was reduced with lithium aluminium hydride. The product was hydrolysed and 7, 7, 10 -trimethly-Δ-octal- 2 -one was obtained. 10 -(+) -Camphor- 10 -sulphonyloxymethyl- 7, 7,-dimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 - one- 2 -dioxolene (XXIIf) was prepared by treating 10 -hydroxymethyl- 7, 7 -dimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one- 2 -dioxolane (XXIIb) with (+) -camphor- 10 -sulphonyl chloride; the cli? ^tei^eoiaoi for;. ^ of tlie ? f / 4 *dinltro_ ^•^. hydrfu. orue ve,-e resolved by euaiia' tion.
