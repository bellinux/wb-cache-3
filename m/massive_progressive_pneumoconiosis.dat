40|$|ABSTRACT Lungs from 123 coalworkers {{coming to}} {{necropsy}} were examined {{to determine the}} association between dust related changes in the central lymph nodes and <b>progressive</b> <b>massive</b> fibrosis and secondary foci in the lung parenchyma. Increasingly extensive changes of the central nodes were scored macroscopically, the highest scores indicating erosion through the walls of adjacent bronchi or branches of the pulmonary artery or both. In 88 cases (mainly with extensive changes) microscopic assessment was also made. Increasingly extensive changes of central nodes were asso-ciated {{with the presence of}} <b>progressive</b> <b>massive</b> fibrosis in the lungs (p < 0. 001) and the presence of secondary foci in lungs without <b>progressive</b> <b>massive</b> fibrosis (p < 0 - 03).

40|$|Introduction: Sinus {{histiocytosis}} {{with massive}} lymphadenopathy is an infrequent, self-resolving histo-proliferative disorder of benign nature, {{also known as}} Rosai–Dorfman Disease. The typical manifestation of this disease includes bilateral, progressive cervical lymphadenopathy along with pyrexia. Laboratory manifestations consist of raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate, leukocytosis and hypergammaglobulinemia. Case report: An 8 year old female child presented with progressive, painful cervical and submandibular lymphadenopathy of three months duration. There was polymorphic leukocytosis and anemia along with raised Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and hypergammaglobulinemia. Fine Needle Aspiration cytology revealed sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, which was confirmed by the cervical lymph node biopsy. The histopathology revealed dilated sinuses filled with lympho plasma cells, large histiocytes and engulfed neutrophils (Emperipolesis). Conclusion: <b>Massive,</b> <b>progressive</b> bilateral cervical and sub mandibular lymphadenopathy, suggesting Sinus histiocytosis and massive lymphadenopathy-Rosai–Dorfman Disease.

ResultsAmong eight miners {{who worked as}} drill operators or blasters {{for most of their}} tenure (median, 35. 5 years), two reported poor dust control practices, working in visible dust clouds as recently as 2012. Chest radiographs progressed to <b>progressive</b> <b>massive</b> fibrosis in as few as 11 years. One miner 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s lung biopsy demonstrated fibrosis and interstitial accumulation of macrophages containing abundant silica, aluminum silicate, and titanium dust particles.

40|$|Information {{regarding}} {{adverse health}} effects resulting from exposure to respirable coal mine dust was reviewed {{as a basis for}} the development of new occupational safety and health standards. Evidence indicated that coal mine dust exposures over a working lifetime may result in the development of simple coal workers' <b>pneumoconiosis,</b> <b>progressive</b> <b>massive</b> fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Based on epidemiology studies, a working lifetime exposure to levels of coal dust at the current Mine Safety and Health Administration permissible exposure limit of 2 mg/m 3 increased the risk of developing these disorders. When exposure also occurs to crystalline silica (14808607) at respirable size particles, the danger of developing silicosis or mixed dust pneumoconiosis was also present. NIOSH recommends in this report that the exposures to respirable coal mine dust be limited to 1 mg/m 3 as a time weighted average concentration for up to 10 hours a day during a 40 hour work week. Recommendations are provided concerning respirable coal mine dust sampling to monitor worker exposure, the proper use of personal protective equipment, and medical screening and surveillance examinations.

40|$|To aid in {{diagnostic}} chest film {{interpretation of}} coal workers' pneumoconiosis, a composite profile of common radiologic patterns {{was developed in}} 98 Appalachian former coal miners who were diagnosed as having coal miner's pneumoconiosis and who applied for black lung benefits. The mean age was 61 years, with a lifetime coal mine dust exposure of 18. 7 years. Results showed that chest radiographs of coal workers' simple pneumoconiosis contained small irregular linear opacities more frequently (47 %) than small rounded opacities. Sparse profusion of all small opacities was the rule. Small opacities involved two out of six lung zones simultaneously 39 % of the time while other combinations occurred less frequently. Lower zones were involved more frequently than upper ones. Thickened pleura occurred in 18 % of radiographs. Other frequent radiographic abnormalities were parenchymal calcifications (19 %), marked emphysema (12 %), and inactive tuberculosis (12 %). Calcification of the aortic knob, a degenerative process reflecting age, occurred in 9 %.
