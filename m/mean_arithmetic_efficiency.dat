40|$|Long-term total {{phosphorus}} loads from 17 urban catchments in the USA were predicted using five different measures of central tendency defining site <b>mean</b> concentration (<b>arithmetic</b> <b>mean,</b> geometric mean, median, harmonic mean and flow-weighted mean). Overall, the flow-weighted mean concentration produced {{the most accurate}} predictions of long-term loads. The geometric mean produced the second most accurate predictions. Along with the median and harmonic mean, the geometric mean predicted long-term load relatively well at most catchments exhibiting negative correlations between event mean concentration and total event runoff depth. However, they significantly underestimated long-term load at catchments exhibiting {{a positive correlation between}} these variables.

40|$|The {{specific}} growth rate, G, {{is widely}} used in articles dealing {{with the growth of}} aquatic organisms under experimental conditions. When individuals are untagged, the <b>arithmetic</b> <b>mean</b> of G for a group of animals must be calculated from weight geometric <b>means,</b> not from <b>arithmetic</b> <b>means.</b> The type of weight mean used in articles to calculate the <b>arithmetic</b> <b>mean</b> of G is usually not reported, and an extended use of weight <b>arithmetic</b> <b>means</b> is common. The <b>arithmetic</b> <b>mean</b> of G so calculated is biased according to the increment in the squared coefficient of variation of body weights. Another potential bias in the calculation of the <b>arithmetic</b> <b>mean</b> of G is size-dependent mortality; this bias cannot be avoided when individuals are untagged, but maximal and minimal values can be obtained. In summary, in view of these analytical results, it seems prudent to calculate the <b>arithmetic</b> <b>mean</b> of G for a group of untagged animals from geometric means of weights, and to estimate the maximal error due to the possibility of size-dependent mortality whenever possible...|$|R
