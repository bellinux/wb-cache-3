5|$|A B <b>movie</b> <b>or</b> B {{film is a}} low-budget {{commercial}} movie, but {{one that}} is not an arthouse film. In its original usage, during the Golden Age of Hollywood, the term more precisely identified films intended for distribution as the less-publicized bottom half of a double feature (akin to B-sides for recorded music). Although the U.S. production of movies intended as second features largely ceased {{by the end of the}} 1950s, the term B movie continues to be used in its broader sense to this day. In its post–Golden Age usage, there is ambiguity on both sides of the definition: on the one hand, the primary interest of many inexpensive exploitation films is prurient; on the other, many B movies display a high degree of craft and aesthetic ingenuity.|$|E
