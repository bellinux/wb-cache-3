5|$|Childfree couples {{choose to}} not have {{children}}. These include: young couples, who plan to have children later, {{as well as those}} who do not plan to have any children. Involuntary childlessness <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> infertility, medical problems, death of a child, or other factors.|$|E
5|$|Opportunistic infections <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites {{that are}} {{normally}} {{controlled by the}} immune system. Which infections occur depends partly on what organisms are common in the person's environment. These infections may affect nearly every organ system.|$|E
5|$|Several Parkinson-related {{genes are}} {{involved}} in the function of lysosomes, organelles that digest cellular waste products. It has been suggested that some cases of PD <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> lysosome dysfunctions that reduce the ability of cells to break down alpha-synuclein.|$|E

50|$|Chorea <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> drugs (commonly levodopa, anti-convulsants and anti-psychotics).|$|R
5|$|Toothache <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> dental (odontogenic) {{conditions}} (such {{as those}} involving the dentin-pulp complex or periodontium), or by non-dental (non-odontogenic) conditions (such as maxillary sinusitis or angina pectoris). There are many possible non-dental causes, {{but the vast}} majority of toothache is dental in origin.|$|E
5|$|Unusually low or high sodium {{levels in}} humans are {{recognized}} in medicine as hyponatremia and hypernatremia. These conditions <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> genetic factors, ageing, or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea.|$|E
5|$|In COPD, it {{may take}} longer to breathe out than to breathe in. Chest {{tightness}} may occur but is not common and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> another problem. Those with obstructed airflow may have wheezing or decreased sounds with air entry on examination of the chest with a stethoscope. A barrel chest is a characteristic sign of COPD, but is relatively uncommon. Tripod positioning may occur as the disease worsens.|$|E

5|$|In March 2007, it {{was found}} that the {{variation}} of radio emissions from the planet did not match Saturn's rotation rate. This variance <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> geyser activity on Saturn's moon Enceladus. The water vapor emitted into Saturn's orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon Saturn's magnetic field, slowing its rotation slightly relative to the rotation of the planet.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{in cancer}} can be {{produced}} by mechanical (e.g. pinching) or chemical (e.g. inflammation) stimulation of specialized pain-signalling nerve endings found {{in most parts of}} the body (called nociceptive pain), or it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> diseased, damaged or compressed nerves, in which case it is called neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is often accompanied by other feelings such as pins and needles.|$|E
5|$|The {{observed}} helium to hydrogen {{ratio in}} Vega is 0.030±0.005, {{which is about}} 40% lower than the Sun. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> the disappearance of a helium convection zone near the surface. Energy transfer is instead performed by the radiative process, which may be causing an abundance anomaly through diffusion.|$|E

25|$|Neurotoxic effects <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> {{rattlesnake}} venom. These effects vary by species, {{and within}} species by population.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} found with Nasodigitoacoustic syndrome {{can be managed}} or treated. Sensorineural hearing loss in humans <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> a loss of hair cells (sensory receptors in the inner ear {{that are associated with}} hearing). This can be hereditary and/or within a syndrome, {{as is the case with}} nasodigitoacoustic syndrome, or attributed to infections such as viruses. For the management of sensorineural hearing loss, hearing aids have been used. Treatments, depending upon the cause and severity, may include a pharmacological approach (i.e., the use of certain steroids), or surgical intervention, like a cochlear implant.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of the metal, toxicological data are available only for compounds. Water-soluble barium compounds are poisonous. In low doses, barium ions act as a muscle stimulant, and higher doses affect the nervous system, causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, anxiety, shortness of breath, and paralysis. This toxicity <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> Ba2+ blocking potassium ion channels, which are critical to the proper function of the nervous system. Other organs damaged by water-soluble barium compounds (i.e., barium ions) are the eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin causing, for example, blindness and sensitization.|$|E
5|$|Eta Apodis {{is a white}} main {{sequence}} star located 138 ± 1 light-years distant. Of apparent magnitude 4.89, it is 1.77 times as massive, 15.5 times as luminous as the Sun and has 2.13 times its radius. Aged 250 ± 200 million years old, this star is emitting an excess of 24μm infrared radiation, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> a debris disk of dust orbiting {{at a distance of}} more than 31 astronomical units from it.|$|E
50|$|Allergic {{rhinitis}} <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> allergy to Balsam of Peru, {{which is}} in various fragrances and other products.|$|R

5|$|Observations, {{first with}} the Palomar Testbed Interferometer by David Ciardi and Gerard van Belle in 2001 and then later {{confirmed}} with the CHARA array at Mt. Wilson in 2006 and the Infrared Optical Telescope Array at Mt. Hopkins in 2011, revealed evidence for an inner dust band around Vega. Originating within 8AU of the star, this exozodiacal dust may be evidence of dynamical perturbations within the system. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> an intense bombardment of comets or meteors, and may be evidence {{for the existence of}} a planetary system.|$|E
5|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} and cumulative fatigue effects describe how individuals {{who fail to}} have an adequate period of sleep (78hours in 24hours) or who have been awake longer than the conventional 1617hours will suffer sleep deprivation. A sleep deficit accumulates with successive sleep-deprived days, and additional fatigue <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> breaking daily sleep into two shorter periods {{in place of a}} single unbroken period of sleep. A sleep deficit is not instantly reduced by one night's sleep; it may take two or three conventional sleep cycles for an individual to return to unimpaired performance.|$|E
5|$|Some TLPs <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> gas {{escaping}} from underground cavities. These gaseous events are purported {{to display a}} distinctive reddish hue, while others have appeared as white clouds or an indistinct haze. The majority of TLPs appear {{to be associated with}} floor-fractured craters, the edges of lunar maria, or in other locations linked by geologists with volcanic activity. However, {{these are some of the}} most common targets when viewing the Moon, and this correlation could be an observational bias.|$|E
25|$|Conjunctivitis <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> allergens such as pollen, perfumes, cosmetics, smoke, dust mites, Balsam of Peru, and eye drops.|$|R
