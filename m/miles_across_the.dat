The cyclone entered the Gulf of Mexico, and two barges broke loose from towing vessels via strong winds and high waves. One barge was an oil rig tender that {{contained}} 16people; it was carried several hundred <b>miles</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> central Gulf of Mexico. All crew members survived, {{and there were no}} maritime deaths related to the hurricane. Jeanne produced a prolonged period of rough surf and heavy swells along the Texas coast. Tides reached 2 to 4feet (1.20m) above normal. The hurricane caused coastal flooding; the worst flooding occurred near Galveston.|$|E
5|$|This British Empire victory, {{the first}} against the Ottoman Empire in the war, ensured {{the safety of}} the Suez Canal from ground attacks, and ended the Central Powers' ambitions of disrupting traffic through the canal by gaining control of the {{strategically}} important northern approaches to the Suez Canal. The pursuit by the Anzac Mounted Division which ended at Bir el Abd on 12 August began the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. Thereafter, the Anzac Mounted Division supported by the Imperial Camel Brigade were on the offensive, pursuing the German and Ottoman army many <b>miles</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Sinai Peninsula, reversing in a most emphatic manner the defeat suffered at Katia three months earlier.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} the British in the Siege of Boston on March 17, 1776, commander-in-chief General George Washington brought the Continental Army {{to defend the}} port city of New York, then limited to the southern end of Manhattan Island. Washington understood that the city's harbor would provide an excellent base for the British Navy during the campaign, so he established defenses there and waited for the British to attack. In July, the British under the command of General William Howe landed a few <b>miles</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> harbor from Manhattan on the sparsely-populated Staten Island, where they were slowly reinforced by ships in Lower New York Bay during the next month and a half, bringing their total force to 32,000 troops. Washington knew the difficulty in holding the city with the British fleet in control of the entrance to the harbor at the Narrows, and he moved the bulk of his forces to Manhattan, believing that {{it would be the first}} target.|$|E

5|$|GeoJourney was {{a special}} {{academic}} program conducted by the School of Earth, Environment, and Society that featured a nine-week field trip/camping trip/road trip across the United States to national parks and monuments granting 24 students a semester of college credit. The GeoJourney field program included Geology, Environmental Studies and Native American studies. Credits applied to the BG Perspective general education requirements. Students on the journey conducted interdisciplinary field investigations and gained first-hand experiences {{in a wide range}} of environments. In 2004 the first GeoJourney trip went to 24 states, 30 national parks and covered over 14,500 <b>miles</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> United States. The program was pulled from the University in 2013 by its creators Nichole and Ian Rodgers.|$|E
5|$|The coast path then reaches St Alban's Head, just to {{the south}} of the village of Worth Matravers. Between St Alban's Head and the resort of Swanage is Durlston Country Park nature reserve. North of Swanage is the chalk Ballard Down, the eastern tip of which has been eroded to form Old Harry Rocks– a series of stacks, arches and caves jutting into the sea between Swanage Bay and Studland Bay. This {{headland}} marks the end of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site. Behind Studland beach, an extensive system of sand dunes have formed a psammosere, stretching for <b>miles</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Studland peninsula. The peninsula forms one shore of Poole Harbour, one of the largest natural harbours in the world. Part of Studland beach is the National Trust's only official naturist beach. The South West Coast Path ends at South Haven Point, where there is a commemorative marker. The Sandbanks Ferry links this to the Sandbanks area of Poole on {{the eastern edge of the}} harbour.|$|E
5|$|No {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} Adams or its glaciers existed until Professor William Denison Lyman and Horace S. Lyman published descriptions of three of its glaciers and various other features of the southern flanks of the mountain in 1886. The White Salmon/Avalanche, Mazama, and Klickitat Glaciers were those described. They also postulated Adams {{to be the source}} of some of the Columbia River basalt flows. They thought that Adams was within what was originally an enormous caldera that was about one hundred <b>miles</b> <b>across.</b> <b>The</b> southern boundary of this enormous caldera was the anticline ridge that forms the southern border of the Glenwood Valley. Modern geology has since dismissed this theory. From information collected on an outing of the Mazamas in 1895, Professor Lyman expanded his descriptions of those three glaciers in 1896. Adams was finally properly surveyed in 1901, when Rusk led noted geologist/glaciologist Harry Fielding Reid to Adams' remote location. Reid conducted the first systematic study of the volcano and also named its most significant glaciers, Pinnacle, Adams, Lava, Lyman, and Rusk with suggestions from Rusk. He also named Castle Rock (The Castle), Little Mount Adams, and Red Butte. Reid noted that it was apparent that the glaciers of Adams had been significantly larger during the Little Ice Age. The geologic history of Adams would have to wait another 80 years before it was fully explored.|$|E

Although not {{the intention of the}} Army Air Forces, gliders were generally considered expendable by high-ranking European theater officers and combat personnel and were abandoned or destroyed after landing. While equipment and methods for extracting flyable gliders were developed and delivered to Europe, half of that equipment was rendered unavailable by certain higher-ranked officers. Despite this lack of support for the recovery system, several gliders were recovered from Normandy and even more from Operation Market Garden in the Netherlands and Wesel, Germany.|$|E

However, the Soviet ground forces to be committed had little or no experience in amphibious warfare and little time for familiarization with Shumshu itself, and this, too, threatened the Soviet ability to establish the necessary beachhead. Gnechko hoped that by focusing the landing force in a concentrated attack on a small area, he could overcome these difficulties and establish a secure beachhead on which the Soviets could deploy artillery and mortars quickly.|$|E

25|$|Hurricane Hugo was a {{powerful}} Cape Verde–type hurricane that caused widespread damage and loss of life in Guadeloupe, Saint Croix, Puerto Rico, and the Southeast United States. It formed over the eastern Atlantic near the Cape Verde Islands on September 9, 1989. Hugo moved thousands of <b>miles</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic, rapidly strengthening to briefly attain category 5 hurricane strength on its journey. It later crossed over Guadeloupe and St. Croix on September 17 and 18 as a category 4 hurricane. Weakening slightly more, it passed over Puerto Rico as a strong category 3 hurricane. Further weakening occurred several hours after re-emerging into the Atlantic, becoming downgraded to a category 2 hurricane. However, it re-strengthened into a category 4 hurricane before making landfall just slightly north of Charleston, on Isle of Palms on September 21 with 140mph sustained winds (gusts to more than 160mph). It had devolved to a remnant low near Lake Erie by the next day. As of 2016, Hurricane Hugo is the most intense tropical cyclone to strike the East Coast north of Florida since 1900.|$|E
25|$|At first all firing was {{at close}} range; half the Indian men {{were killed or}} wounded before {{they had a chance}} to get off any shots. Some of the Indians grabbed rifles from the piles of confiscated weapons and opened fire on the {{soldiers}}. With no cover, and with many of the Indians unarmed, this lasted a few minutes at most. While the Indian warriors and soldiers were shooting at close range, other soldiers used the Hotchkiss guns against the tipi camp full of women and children. It is believed that many of the soldiers were victims of friendly fire from their own Hotchkiss guns. The Indian women and children fled the camp, seeking shelter in a nearby ravine from the crossfire. The officers had lost all control of their men. Some of the soldiers fanned out and finished off the wounded. Others leaped onto their horses and pursued the Indians (men, women, and children), in some cases for <b>miles</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> prairies. In less than an hour, at least 150 Lakota had been killed and 50 wounded. Historian Dee Brown, in Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, mentions an estimate of 300 of the original 350 having been killed or wounded and that the soldiers loaded 51 survivors (4 men and 47 women and children) onto wagons and took them to the Pine Ridge Reservation. Army casualties numbered 25 dead and 39 wounded.|$|E
25|$|At the Drive-In {{was founded}} in 1994 by guitarist Jim Ward and vocalist Cedric Bixler. The newly formed band played its first live show on October 15, 1994 at the Loretto High School Fair in El Paso, Texas. Not long after, At the Drive-In {{released}} its first studio recording entitled Hell Paso, a 7-inch EP issued in November 1994. Following Hell Paso’s release, the band members embarked on their first tour – a 2,000-mile trek across the state of Texas. After a drummer change, At the Drive-In released its second EP ¡Alfaro Vive, Carajo! in June 1995. The band then set out on another tour, this one in a newly purchased 1981 Ford Econoline and spanning 42 days and 10,000 <b>miles</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> United States. During these tours, At the Drive-In began developing a large underground following by mostly playing in basements and small venues across the western United States, with their popularity spread {{by word of mouth}} among fans. One such show that changed the course of history for the band was in a now defunct bar in Los Angeles, where the band put on an explosive performance for just nine people – some of them employees of the Flipside record label. The staffers were so enthralled by the show that they offered to put out At the Drive-In’s record then and there. Accepting the offer, the band first headed out on another 21-day tour of the Southwest before ending in Los Angeles again where they recorded their debut full-length album titled Acrobatic Tenement for $600.|$|E
