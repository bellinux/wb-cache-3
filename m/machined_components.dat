500|$|The CH-47Fs have {{generally}} similar performance to the CH-47Ds. However, the F variant {{was designed to}} be easier to maintain and deploy. Its fuselage comprises a small number of <b>machined</b> <b>components,</b> rather than the large number of fabricated sections of sheet metal used in the D variant, which reduces vibration and structural cracking. The F variant also includes more advanced avionics as well as design features which enable the helicopters to be more quickly prepared to be transported within a cargo aircraft. The first seven Australian CH-47Fs are fitted with rotor brakes and other equipment to better enable them to operate from the Royal Australian Navy's Canberra class landing helicopter dock vessels, but are otherwise identical to those operated by the US Army. The second tranche of three CH-47Fs are not fitted with rotor brakes as they were taken directly from the production line of helicopters for the US Army. As of 2017, it was planned to fit these helicopters with rotor brakes by 2020.|$|E

30|$|Time Synchronous Averaging {{can remove}} {{interference}} frequencies induced by environmental noise and other irrelevant <b>machine</b> <b>components</b> [43]. But, {{there is no}} environmental noise in the simulated signals.

When a more complex gearbox system is simulated, TSA may be needed. However, in real applications, especially for the slight pitting damage scenario, TSA and subsequent feature extraction may not be adequate for effective fault detection and diagnosis. Advanced signal processing techniques, such as empirical mode decomposition and wavelet analysis, may be used together with TSA for more effective fault detection and diagnosis.|$|R
