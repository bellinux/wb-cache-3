500|$|The {{rivalry between}} Fillmore and Seward was {{affected}} by the growing anti-slavery movement. Although Fillmore disliked slavery, he saw no reason {{it should be a}} political issue. [...] Seward, on the other hand, was hostile to slavery and <b>made</b> <b>that</b> <b>clear</b> in his actions as governor, refusing to return slaves claimed by Southerners. When in 1839, the Buffalo bar proposed Fillmore for the position of vice chancellor of the eighth judicial district. [...] Seward refused, and nominated Frederick Whittlesey; in making the nomination, Seward indicated that if the state senate rejected Whittlesey, he still would not appoint Fillmore.|$|E
2500|$|A {{year after}} Corus' purchase, co-founders and co-CEOs Loubert and Smith left the studio. Loubert voluntarily left in November after Corus {{eliminated}} 50 positions from the staff, saying [...] "The {{time has come}} that Corus will stop acquiring {{for a while and}} start operating. John Cassaday has <b>made</b> <b>that</b> <b>clear,</b> but this makes my job less rather than more".|$|E
2500|$|In March 2011, Cambage {{expressed}} {{a reluctance to}} play for the Tulsa Shock in the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), stating, [...] "I don't want to play at Tulsa, I've <b>made</b> <b>that</b> <b>clear.</b> They want to make me a franchise player, but I'm not going to the WNBA for that. I'm going there to learn and improve my game. But what can you do?" [...] She played in the 2011 WNBA All-Star Game.|$|E
6000|$|RENCH (after a pause). Why, I thought we'd <b>made</b> <b>that</b> pretty <b>clear,</b> Captain. We've got {{something}} {{to fall back on}} in case the employers don't live up to their agreements. I'm not speaking of you-- ...|$|R

2500|$|Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams {{added his}} voice to the condemnation, saying, [...] "There is no {{justification}} for what happened this afternoon in Dublin. Sinn Féin had appealed to people to ignore this loyalist parade {{and not to be}} provoked by it. Our view was that it should not be opposed in any way and we <b>made</b> <b>that</b> <b>clear.</b> Regrettably a small, unrepresentative group chose to ignore our appeal." [...] The President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, also condemned the rioters. Jeffrey Donaldson of the Democratic Unionist Party, who was in Dublin to address the Love Ulster march, said he was 'appalled' by the violence.|$|E

50|$|Noseworthy was {{an active}} parliamentarian and defended the rights of {{immigrants}} and minorities.

5000|$|The FBI report <b>made</b> it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{the more}} {{consistent}} accuracy of 9mm {{in the hands}} of their agents was a factor in their returning to 9mm as their standard handgun caliber. It was also <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the similar effectiveness of 9mm compared to [...]40 S&W and [...]45 ACP was due to the high quality of 9mm ammunition available.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was clear}} to Smith that {{only a portion of}} the {{precious}} objects which were buried with the mummy had been placed in this basket. Why had these been left where he found them? A little reflection <b>made</b> <b>that</b> <b>clear</b> also. Something had prompted the thief to destroy the desecrated body and its coffin with fire, probably in the hope of hiding his evil handiwork. Then he fled with his spoil. But he had forgotten how fiercely mummies and their trappings can burn. Or perhaps the thing was an accident. He must have had a lamp, and if its flame chanced to touch this bituminous tinder! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing--first. I {{might have}} {{told her she had}} been in a hurry. But if she don't bother me, I won't her. We got as far as that. And I reckon she won't, but I thought we'd better have a clear understanding, and she knows now it's bigamy in her case, and bigamy's a penitentiary offense. I <b>made</b> <b>that</b> <b>clear.</b> And now see here, David: I'm going to stay here in this settlement, and I don't want any trouble from you, no matter what you think of my doings, past, present, or future. I don't want you to say anything, or look anything. Don't you let on, even to that girl of yours, that you ever saw me before in your life. If you do, you'll wish you had split my head open with that ax. But I'm not afraid; I've got you safe, and I've got your sister safe." ...|$|E
6000|$|But Dickens {{has been}} careful to suggest, with {{suspicious}} breadth of candour, another {{explanation of the}} source of Grewgious's knowledge. If Edwin has really escaped, and met Grewgious, Dickens does not want us to be sure of that, as Mr. Proctor was sure. Dickens deliberately puts his readers on another trail, though neither Mr. Walters nor Mr. Proctor struck the scent. As we have noted, Grewgious at once says to Jasper, [...] "I HAVE JUST COME FROM MISS LANDLESS." [...] This tells Jasper nothing, but it tells a great deal to the watchful reader, who remembers that Miss Landless, and she only, is aware that Jasper loves, bullies, and insults Rosa, and that Rosa's life is embittered by Jasper's silent wooing, and his unspoken threats. Helena may also know that [...] "Ned is a threatened name," [...] as we have seen, and that the menace comes from Jasper. As Jasper is now known to be Edwin's rival in love, and as Edwin has vanished, the murderer, Mr. Grewgious reckons, is Jasper; and his experiment, with Jasper's consequent shriek and fit, confirms the hypothesis. Thus Grewgious had information enough, from Miss Landless, to suggest his experiment--Dickens intentionally <b>made</b> <b>that</b> <b>clear</b> (though not clear enough for Mr. Proctor and Mr. Cuming Walters)--while his experiment gives him a moral certainty of Jasper's crime, but yields no legal evidence.|$|E

6000|$|Then he understood. It was Marjorie! He had {{a twinge}} of surprise, and glanced at his own {{daughter}} {{as though he had}} never seen her before. He perceived in a flash {{for the first time that}} this troublesome, clever, disrespectful child was tall and shapely and sweet, and indeed quite a beautiful young woman. He forgot his anecdotes. His being was suffused with pride and responsibility and the sense of virtue rewarded. He did not reflect for a moment that Marjorie embodied in almost equal proportions the very best points in his mother and his mother-in-law, and avoided his own more salient characteristics with so neat a dexterity that from top to toe, except for the one matter of colour, not only did she not resemble him but she scarcely even alluded to him. He thought simply that she was his daughter, that she derived from him, that her beauty was his. She was the outcome of his meritorious preparations. He recalled all the moments when he had been kind and indulgent to her, all the bills he had paid for her; all the stresses and trials of the coach-building collapse, all the fluctuations of his speculative adventures, became things he had faced patiently and valiantly for her sake. He forgot the endless times when he had been viciously cross with her, all the times when he had pished and tushed and sworn in her hearing. He had on provocation and in spite of her mother's protests slapped her pretty vigorously, but such things are better forgotten; nor did he recall how bitterly he had opposed the college education which had made her now so clear in eye and thought, nor the frightful shindy, only three months since, about that identical green dress in which she now stood delightful. He forgot these petty details, as an idealist should. There she was, his daughter. An immense benevolence irradiated his soul--for Marjorie--for Magnet. His eyes were suffused with a not ignoble tenderness. The man, he knew, was worth at least thirty-five thousand pounds, a discussion of investments had <b>made</b> <b>that</b> <b>clear,</b> and he must be making at least five thousand a year! A beautiful girl, a worthy man! A good fellow, a sound good fellow, a careful fellow too--as these fellows went! ...|$|E
50|$|Despite {{efforts by}} the Grand Trunk Railway to turn a profit, {{including}} the former CAR lines, it was fairly obvious {{not long after the}} 1905 purchase that this was not going to happen.

60|$|At last, however, {{she fell}} into a really calm sleep, and when she awoke, the room was full of light, but her watch had stopped; she had been too much tired to {{remember}} to wind it; and she lay a little while hearing sounds <b>that</b> <b>made</b> it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the world was astir, {{and she could see}} that preparations had been made for her getting up.|$|R

She claims to know a lot about guys despite barely interacting with them, intereacting even less so when she becomes friends with Mari. Over the course of the story she developed feelings for Mari, and her increasing jealousy of Mari's boyfriend <b>made</b> <b>that</b> <b>clear</b> for her.|$|E
