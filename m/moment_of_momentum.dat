25|$|In physics, angular {{momentum}} (rarely, <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> <b>momentum</b> or rotational momentum) is the rotational equivalent of linear momentum.

25|$|The only {{remedy for}} {{this loss of}} control is to desaturate the CMGs by {{removing}} the excess angular momentum from the spacecraft. The simplest way of doing this is to use Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters. In our example of saturation along the forward axis, the RCS will be fired to produce an anticlockwise torque about that axis. The CMG control program will then command the rotor spin axes to begin fanning out away from the forward direction, producing gyroscopic torques whose resultant is clockwise about the forward direction, opposing the RCS {{as long as it}} is still firing and holding the spacecraft steady. This is continued until a suitable amount of forward angular momentum has been drained out of the CMG rotors; it is transformed into the <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> <b>momentum</b> of the moving matter in the RCS thruster exhausts and carried away from the spacecraft.|$|E

40|$|The {{experimentally}} obtainable <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>momentum</b> {{have become}} a standard way to evaluate the performance of computational methods in p-space. The absolute percentage errors on the moments APE() with respect to those of a high quality electron momentum distribution (EMD), were previously studied by Hart and Thakkar 1 and lead {{to the conclusion that}} DFT generally performs worse than Hartree-Fock (HF) in momentum space. These findings are contradictory to those published earlier by Hamel et al 2 and Duffy 3. There, DFT is considered a useful source of molecular orbitals for comparison with EMS experiments. In order {{to bridge the gap between}} these contradictive statements concerning DFT in p-space, we present a study that employs momentum space quantum similarity measures or mQSM as a tool to evaluate the errors on <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>momentum.</b> Our test set consists of 68 closed-shell molecules in their ground states.

40|$|A three-step {{theory of}} crystal growth is {{proposed}} which involves first {{an association of}} molecules or ions in solution to form an impinging growth unit, then second the orientation of this unit prior to {{its impact on the}} surface of a crystal, and finally the attachment of this unit to the crystal face.

40|$|Using overlap {{as well as}} Wilson fermions, we have {{computed}} the one-loop renormalization {{factors of}} ten non-singlet operators which measure the third <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> quark <b>momentum</b> and helicity distributions (the lowest two having been computed in a previous paper), {{as well as the}} lowest three <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> the $g_ 2 $ structure function and the lowest two non-trivial <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> the $h_ 1 $ transversity structure function (plus the tensor charge). These factors are needed to extract physical observables from Monte Carlo simulations of the corresponding matrix elements. An exact chiral symmetry is maintained in our calculations with overlap fermions, and its most important consequence here is that the operators measuring $g_ 2 $ do not show any of the power-divergent mixings with operators of lower dimension which are present in the Wilson case. Many of our results for Wilson fermions are also new; for the remaining ones, we agree with the literature except in one case. The computations have been carried out using the symbolic language FORM, in a general covariant gauge, which turns out also to be useful in checking the gauge-invariance of the final results.
