50|$|On 1987 ZyMOS {{introduced}} a POACH (PC-On-A-Chip) 82x3x <b>multifunction</b> <b>peripheral</b> series, a virtually first chipset for cloning IBM AT. Intel soon licensed this chipset to support Intel 80286 sales.|$|E
50|$|Desktop {{publishing}} {{combines a}} personal computer and WYSIWYG page layout software to create publication documents on a computer for either large scale publishing or small scale local <b>multifunction</b> <b>peripheral</b> output and distribution. Desktop publishing methods provide more control over design, layout, and typography than word processing. However, word processing software has evolved to include some, though by no means all, capabilities previously available only with professional printing or desktop publishing.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{third-party}} PostScript-compatible interpreters {{are widely}} used in printers and <b>multifunction</b> <b>peripherals</b> (MFPs). For example, CSR plc's IPS PS3 interpreter, formerly known as PhoenixPage, is standard in many printers and MFPs, including those developed by Hewlett-Packard and sold under the LaserJet and Color LaserJet lines. Other third-party PostScript solutions used by print and MFP manufacturers include Jaws and the Harlequin RIP, both by Global Graphics. A free software version, with several other applications, is Ghostscript. Several compatible interpreters are listed on the Undocumented Printing Wiki.|$|R
5000|$|SigmaTel (SGTL delisted from NASDAQ after 2008 {{acquisition}} by Freescale Semiconductor) was a System On a Chip SOC {{electronics and}} software company headquartered in Austin, Texas, that designed AV media player/recorder SOCs, reference circuit boards, SOC Software Development Kits {{built around a}} custom cooperative kernel and all SOC device drivers including USB Mass Storage and AV decoder DSP, media player/recorder software apps, and controller chips for <b>multifunction</b> <b>peripherals.</b> SigmaTel became Austin's largest IPO as of 2003 when it became publicly traded on NASDAQ. The company was driven by a talented mix of electrical and computer engineers plus other professionals with semiconductor industry experience in Silicon Hills, the number two IC design region in the United States, after Silicon Valley.|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} a 6 -month project with a physical therapy clinic, involving equal parts ethnographic fieldwork and rapid prototyping. It differed from most reported user-informed design by having an explicit dual purpose. On the one hand, the prototype should provide significant, measurable improvements {{for the field}} site. On the other hand, the project sponsor {{did not intend to}} develop the prototype into a product but rather identify future opportunities and needs in the small-to-medium health care sector, requirements for next generation <b>multifunction</b> <b>peripherals</b> (MFPs), and business applications of existing technology. Thus, the project simultaneously investigated specific solutions for a specific work practice while looking for key technologies to address future needs. This paper provides a detailed account of the process and results, highlighting particular contingencies that come with a dual-purpose exploration, as well as the benefits of a small, focused team that “oscillates ” between research and deployment.
