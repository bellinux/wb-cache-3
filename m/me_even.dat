500|$|Burrell {{signed a}} one-day {{contract}} with the Philadelphia Phillies on May 19, 2012, so he could officially retire as a Phillie. It was announced on February 28, 2015 that Burrell will be inducted onto the Phillies Wall of Fame. He was subsequently inducted on Friday, July 31. He stated, [...] "I always knew that the fans were behind <b>me,</b> <b>even</b> through the tough times. When David (Montgomery) called and told me I had been voted in by the fans, it was overwhelming." [...] He was the 37th inductee to the Wall of Fame.|$|E
500|$|We Are Not Alone {{garnered}} mixed reviews. It was {{met with}} high acclaim from IGN's Colin Moriarty, who felt [...] "extremely satisfied," [...] saying [...] "safely and confidently" [...] that it [...] "might be my personal favorite album of the year," [...] giving it a score of 9.3 out of 10. Conversely, Exclaim! writer Amber Authier felt that, [...] "On first listen its simply generic sound did nothing for me," [...] though later admitted, [...] "I listened to Breaking Benjamin several times over a week and several elements of the disc started to grow on <b>me,</b> <b>even</b> appeal to me." [...] The writer concluded, [...] "Breaking Benjamin created a standard of quality for themselves that they simply couldn't meet on the entire disc." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] {{became a}} Radio Disney hit, {{remaining}} at number one for 12 weeks. The song's success ultimately benefited Milian's {{career as a}} performer; she explained, [...] "I never realized that show would give me so much exposure. It's great because people have grown with <b>me,</b> <b>even</b> with that damn song. Didn’t know {{so many people were}} watching Kim Possible like that. Because of that song, it actually inspired me to do my own musical animated artist {{because a lot of people}} thought I was Kim Possible." [...] Milian has yet to perform the song live in concert but has expressed interest in recording a remix for fans. [...] "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] was the first song Lerios and Gabriel wrote together, and the songwriting duo has since gone on to collaborate on both scoring and writing songs for several other major television networks and programs.|$|E

500|$|In 1962 Littleton’s first {{pieces in}} blown glass were, like his earlier works in pottery, {{functional}} forms: vases, bowls and paperweights. His breakthrough to non-functional form came in 1963 when, with no purpose in mind, he remelted and finished a glass piece {{that he had}} earlier smashed {{in a fit of}} pique. The object lay in his studio for several weeks before he decided to grind the bottom. As Littleton recounts in his book Glassblowing: A Search for Form, he brought the object into the house where [...] "it aroused such antipathy in my wife that I looked at it much more closely, finally deciding to send it to an exhibition. Its refusal there made <b>me</b> <b>even</b> more obstinate, and I took it to New York ... I later showed it to the curators of design at the Museum of Modern Art. They, perhaps relating it to some other neo-Dada work in the museum, purchased it for the Design Collection." [...] This led to Littleton’s mid-1960s series of broken-open forms, and [...] "Prunted," [...] "Imploded" [...] and [...] "Exploded" [...] forms.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} based on actual recent {{research}} and involved much collaboration among the series' different departments. For the scene in which they remove the victim's eyeball, the special effects crew created a mold based on actress Elizabeth Stanley's head. Using plaster to make a prosthetic, they [...] "drilled out the eyeball and sculpt it open and [...] {{through a series of}} molds." [...] Stanley stated that [...] "it's really cool to see the head because it really does look just like <b>me,</b> <b>even</b> though it's very gruesome because the eyeball's popping out." [...] The prop department rigged a weapon which they called a [...] "photon gun"; according to prop master Peter Gelfman, this gun {{was based on}} real devices employed in airport security that look through people's clothing for concealed weapons. VFX Supervisor Christopher Scollard explained that for the eye's last vision, they used [...] "a lot of actual photographic reference on the set and on the location," [...] which they then used to [...] "take that imagery and composite it into the various computer monitors and displays in the lab." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a conference}} call with reporters on August 21, 2012, Daniels {{announced}} that this would be the final season of the series. Daniels said, [...] "This year feels like the last chance to really go out together and make an artistic ending for the show that pays off {{a lot of the stuff}} that matters most to fans." [...] Daniels also said all the questions would be answered, such as who was behind the documentary, and why they had been filming it for so long, as well as the reveal of the Scranton Strangler. A central point during the season was the romance between Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Pete Miller (Jake Lacy). According to Michael Ausiello of TVLine, the nature of their relationship was heavily debated by the writers and producers; he noted that [...] "the triangle [...] has stirred up a number of debates in the writers room, which tells <b>me</b> <b>even</b> they don't know at this point which guy Erin will choose." [...] Daniels consulted with Kemper and asked for her input, as he felt she had the best understanding of Erin's characterization.|$|E

500|$|The Vidiians' {{debut in}} [...] "Phage" [...] {{received}} primarily positive responses from Voyagers cast and crew. Kate Mulgrew praised {{the moment in}} which Janeway {{had to choose between}} [...] "sacrificing Neelix's lungs or allowing another species to continue to survive". She viewed Janeway's initial difficulty with approaching the Vidiians about the subject of ethics as showcasing a level of [...] "poignancy". While discussing the alien species introduced in the early seasons of Voyager, Westmore said that he found the Vidiians to have the most compelling design. He described them as [...] "the most interesting ones that we've run into as far as a new concept and look, and something totally different", highlighting their use of horror conventions. Taylor praised Westmore's work representing the Vidiians as [...] "truly grisly-looking people" [...] without turning them into flat or static characters. Skye Dent had a more critical opinion of the episode, saying that alterations made to her first draft of the script weakened the effectiveness of the alien species as antagonists. She felt that they [...] "just seemed very wimpy to <b>me,</b> <b>even</b> though they were saying the same dialogue I had written".|$|E
500|$|On 25 June 2007, in an {{unexpected}} turn of events, Henry {{was transferred to}} Barcelona for €24million. He signed a four-year deal for a reported €6.8 (£4.6) million per season. It was revealed that the contract included a release clause of €125 (£84.9) million. Henry cited the departure of Dein and continued uncertainty over Wenger's future as reasons for leaving, and maintained that [...] "I always said that if I ever left Arsenal {{it would be to}} play for Barcelona." [...] Despite their captain's departure, Arsenal got off to an impressive start for the 2007–08 campaign, and Henry admitted that his presence in the team might have been more of a hindrance than a help. He stated, [...] "Because of my seniority, the fact that I was captain and my habit of screaming for the ball, they would sometimes give it to <b>me</b> <b>even</b> when I was not in the best position. So in that sense it was good for the team that I moved on." [...] Henry left Arsenal as the club's leading all-time league goalscorer with 174 goals and leading all-time goalscorer in European competitions with 42 goals; in July 2008, Arsenal fans voted him as Arsenal's greatest player ever in Arsenal.com's Gunners' Greatest 50 Players poll.|$|E
500|$|The final {{took place}} on August 16, at 10:10 CST. Before the race, Milorad Čavić made {{headlines}} by saying {{in an interview that}} it would be better for swimming if he beat Phelps. Phelps' coach Bob Bowman used the quote to provide motivation to his protégé. In an interview, Phelps said that doubters like Čavić [...] "fires me up more than anything, I always welcome comments. It definitely motivates <b>me</b> <b>even</b> more." [...] Almost immediately after the race started, Čavić took the lead with Phelps getting off to a slow start. At the turn, Čavić was first, followed by Ian Crocker, while Phelps made the split in seventh place, just 0.62 seconds behind Čavić. As the two approached the finish, Čavić tried to coast to the wall on one last stroke, while Phelps, who had misjudged the end, took an extra half-stroke, causing both competitors to touch the wall at almost exactly the same time. It turned out that Phelps had actually finished one one-hundredth of a second ahead of Čavić, with a time of 50.58 seconds. Phelps even admitted that, at first, he thought the extra stroke he took had cost him the gold medal, until he looked at the scoreboard displaying the results. Andrew Lauterstein won the bronze medal, also beating Crocker by one one-hundredth of a second.|$|E

Malay {{said that he and}} Ocean focused on sonic [...] "intricacies" [...] such as interludes and skits on tracks when mixing the album, which he referred to as their [...] "art project". Ocean said that he admires [...] "the anonymity that directors can have about their films" [...] and explained his use of interludes on the album, saying that [...] "the work is the work. The work is not <b>me</b> ... <b>Even</b> though it's my voice, I'm a storyteller." [...] According to Malay, Kanye West helped Ocean during the album's final stages by providing [...] "a mentorship situation" [...] and connecting him with his [...] "visual people". Malay recalled in an interview for Complex how he and Ocean were [...] "somewhat oblivious to how quickly everything happened" [...] as they were finishing the album, as Ocean's name was [...] "continuing to get bigger and bigger." [...] To downplay himself from being [...] "the focal point" [...] of the album, Ocean did not want his name on the cover and had Everest, his Bernese Mountain Dog, credited as the executive producer instead.|$|E
500|$|The {{context of}} [...] "Part of Your World" [...] {{and the fact}} that it occurs before Ariel meets and falls in love with Eric is often used to defend Ariel against critics who accuse her of sacrificing her talents for a man. Boing Boings Caroline Siede {{explained}} that Ariel [...] "just happens to end up with a prince in the process of achieving her larger dream" [...] to become human. Similarly, Sophie Katz of The Odyssey Online wrote that the song proves that Ariel [...] "doesn’t give up her voice only for a guy. She already wanted to be 'part of that world.' The prince was a bonus." [...] Writing for Yahoo! Movies, Gwynne Watkins penned [...] "There’s little doubt that Ariel’s crush on Prince Eric strengthens her resolve to be part of the human world. But crucially, her love of 'the world above' is established long before she sets eyes on the prince" [...] during [...] "Part of Your World". Laura Stampler, writing for Time, agreed that the character [...] " [...] in love with the human world before she even knew who Eric was" [...] because [...] "she has always dreamed of being a 'part of your world'". Ariel sings [...] "Bright young women, sick of swimmin’, ready to stand" [...] to indicate that she fantasizes about [...] "living in a feminist-friendly society where she can speak her mind freely and grow intellectually", demonstrating envy towards women who are capable of doing this on land. However, Times Laura Stampler joked that Ariel will find the human world disappointing [...] "considering my dad definitely still reprimanded <b>me</b> (<b>even</b> though I had legs)." [...] In the reprise, the lyrics [...] "Part of that world" [...] are replaced with [...] "part of your world" [...] to distinguish that the character is now referring to her feelings for Eric, whom Ariel had not yet met when she sang the original song.|$|E
500|$|Steve Wozniak (who {{consulted}} with Sorkin {{before he had}} written the screenplay) commented on a trailer released on July 1, 2015 {{that he does not}} [...] "talk that way... I would never accuse the graphical interface of being stolen. I never made comments to the effect that I had credit (genius) taken from me... The lines I heard spoken were not things I would say but carried the right message, at least partly... I felt a lot of the real Jobs in the trailer, although a bit exaggerated." [...] Wozniak did not ask to see the final script because he did not [...] "think that would be appropriate... it is the creative work of the producer and writer and actors and director and others." [...] He also noted that the trailer's reference to Jobs' initial rejection of his daughter Lisa evoked an emotional response: [...] "It was hard on <b>me,</b> <b>even</b> being quiet, when Jobs refused to acknowledge his child when the money didn't matter, and I can almost cry remembering it." [...] In September 2015, after seeing a rough cut of the film, Wozniak stated that he felt like he [...] "was actually watching Steve Jobs and the others [...] not actors playing them, I give full credit to Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin for getting it so right." [...] In an interview with San Francisco Chronicle on February 10, 2016, Wozniak claimed that the film's scenes between him and Jobs never occurred in reality. Wozniak specifically mentioned that he never requested Jobs to acknowledge the Apple II team onstage, as was shown in the movie. However, he added that Jobs did purportedly show a lack of respect towards the group. When asked about the accuracy of the film's portrayal of Jobs, Wozniak replied: [...] "In real life, to real people, that's the way he could be, very sharp, (although) never quite as much as in the movie." ...|$|E

500|$|Ria Brown, the biographer of {{competitive}} swimmer Anita Lhoest, claims Lhoest terminated a pregnancy by Eastwood without consulting him {{at one point}} during their late 1950s to early 1960s affair. Restaurant critic Gael Greene admitted to an affair with Eastwood that began when she was assigned to interview him on the set of 1970's Two Mules for Sister Sara. A fling with French model Cathy Reghin around the same time was one of his few extramarital involvements to receive press coverage of any kind during the fact. According to McGilligan, Eastwood had many other affairs, including with co-stars Inger Stevens (Hang 'Em High), Jean Seberg (Paint Your Wagon) and Jo Ann Harris (The Beguiled), as well as actresses Jill Banner, Catherine Deneuve, and Susan St. James, columnist Bridget Byrne and singer Keely Smith while married to Johnson, who, after a trial separation and lingering bout of hepatitis during the mid-1960s, expressed desire to reconcile and start a family. They had two children together: Kyle Eastwood (born May 19, 1968) and Alison Eastwood (born May 22, 1972). In 1972, Eastwood met married actress (later director) Sondra Locke. The two began living together while filming The Outlaw Josey Wales in the autumn of 1975, by which time, according to Locke, [...] "He had told me that there was no real relationship left between him and Maggie." [...] Locke wrote in her autobiography, [...] "Clint seemed astonished at his need for <b>me,</b> <b>even</b> admitting that he'd never been faithful to one woman — because he'd [...] "never been in love before," [...] he confided. He even made up a song about it: [...] "She made me monogamous." [...] That flattered and delighted me. I would never doubt his faithfulness and his love for me." [...] Locke moved into the Sherman Oaks house Eastwood had once shared with Johnson (who by then lived full-time in Pebble Beach), but felt uncomfortable there because [...] "psychologically, it would always be Maggie's." [...] "Finally I told Clint that I couldn't live there any longer," [...] writes Locke. The couple moved to Bel-Air in a fixer-upper Locke spent three years renovating. She underwent two abortions and a tubal ligation in the late 1970s and was most reluctant about the second abortion, noting [...] "I couldn't help but think that that baby, with both Clint's and my best qualities, would be extraordinary." [...] Johnson made no secret of her dislike for Locke, even though the two women never met. [...] "Maggie placed severe rules on my relationship with the kids. Apparently, she never forgave me ... After she learned that Clint had taken me onto her property to show me a baby deer that had just been born there, she laid down a rule that I was never to be allowed there again. I was not even allowed to phone the Pebble Beach house." [...] In 1978 Johnson filed for legal separation from Eastwood, but did not file for divorce until May 1984, a divorce which was finalized that November with Johnson receiving a straight cash payment reported to be between $25 and $30million.|$|E
