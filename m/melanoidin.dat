40|$|The {{ability of}} high {{molecular}} weight <b>melanoidins</b> extracted from coffee, barley coffee and dark beer to inhibit lipid peroxidation during simulated gastric digestion of turkey meat has been investigated. Results showed that <b>melanoidins</b> decrease the synthesis of lipid hydroperoxides and secondary lipoxidation products.

Recent research into nutritional, physiological and functional properties of <b>melanoidins</b> has suggested that they have antioxidant activity. Instant coffees produced from roasted coffee beans were obtained from a company coffee in three different roasting degrees: light (CTn 110), medium (CTn 85) and dark (CTn 60). <b>Melanoidins</b> of high molecular weight (> 10 000 Da) were obtained from each coffee, as well as pure <b>melanoidins</b> by incubation in 2 M ClNa and ultrafiltration.

Therefore, we present a review in which the gastro-intestinal tract is hypothesized to be the main site of action of food <b>melanoidins</b> and melanoproteins biological activity. We described recent data supporting this hypothesis both in vitro model systems and in vivo. Importantly, we focused this review only on the effect of <b>melanoidins</b> and melanoproteins extracted from food.

Isolated fractions were characterized for their <b>melanoidin,</b> nitrogen, protein, phenolic groups, chlorogenic acid, quinic acid, caffeic acid, and sugar content. It {{was found that the}} <b>melanoidin</b> level in all fractions correlated with both the nitrogen and the protein content. The <b>melanoidin</b> level also correlated with the phenolic groups¿ level and ester-linked quinic acid level. It was concluded that proteins and chlorogenic acids should be primarily involved in <b>melanoidin</b> formation. Initial roasting, from green to light-roasted beans, especially {{led to the formation of}} intermediate Mw (IMw) melanoidins when compared to high Mw (HMw) melanoidins. Indications were found that this IMw <b>melanoidin</b> formation is mainly due to Maillard reactions and chlorogenic acid incorporation reactions between chlorogenic acids, sucrose, and amino acids/protein fragments. Additionally, it was found that prolonged roasting predominantly led to formation melanoidins with a high Mw. Furthermore, arabinogalactans seem to be relatively more involved in <b>melanoidin</b> formation than galactomannans.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if preliminary treatment of <b>melanoidin</b> based wastewater by an advanced oxidation process (AOP) made the associated DOC and DON more biodegradable. UV-C irradiation of H 2 O 2 was used to create the hydroxyl radical for chemical oxidation, while aerobic batch bioassays were used to assess the subsequent biodegradability of the DOC and DON associated with <b>melanoidin.</b> State-of-the-art natural organic matter identification techniques were used to identify <b>melanoidin</b> and study the subsequent degradation products throughout the chemical and biological oxidation processes. Melanoidins are large (50 - 70 kDa), coloured. nitrogenous organic compounds that are refractory to sewage treatment plant (STP) biodegradation, but are Susceptible to degradation by sunlight in receiving environments. This study showed that over an extended chemical oxidation period (72 h, which was sufficient to reach maximum chemical degradability) DOC and DON removal from a synthetic <b>melanoidin</b> wastewater were 92 % and 48 %, respectively. In comparison, the DOC and DON removal after 4 h cf chemical oxidation followed by 7 days of aerobic biodegradation were 82 % and 86 %, respectively. Thus, the removal of organic bound nitrogen was drastically improved by using a combination of chemical and biological oxidation in place of the hydroxyl radical AOP alone. Molecular weight fractionation results showed that the cleavage of the large nitrogenous <b>melanoidin</b> molecules, during chemical oxidation, produced small DON molecular weight compounds (< 1 kDa) and ammonia, which were readily biodegradable.

The {{aim of this study}} was to isolate a potential thermotolerant <b>melanoidin</b> decolorizing yeast from natural resources, and optimized different physico-chemical and nutritional parameters. Results Total 24 yeasts were isolated from the soil samples of near by distillery site, in which isolate Y- 9 showed maximum decolorization and identified as Candida tropicalis by Microbial Type Culture Collection (MTCC) Chandigarh, India. The decolorization yield was expressed as the decrease in the absorbance at 475 [*]nm against initial absorbance at the same wavelength. Uninoculated medium served as control. Yeast showed maximum decolorization (75 %) at 45 °C using 0. 2 %, glucose; 0. 2 %, peptone; 0. 05 %, MgSO 4; 0. 01 %, KH 2 PO 4; pH- 5. 5 within 24 [*]h of incubation under static condition.

For all <b>melanoidin</b> fractions, {{it was found}} that more QA than CA was released. QA levels correlated with <b>melanoidin</b> levels, indicating that QA is incorporated in melanoidins. The QA level was correlated with increasing ionic charge of the <b>melanoidin</b> populations, suggesting that QA may contribute to the negative charge and consequently is, most likely, not linked via its carboxyl group.

50|$|<b>Melanoidins</b> are brown, high {{molecular}} weight heterogeneous polymers that are formed when sugars and amino acids combine (through the Maillard reaction) at high temperatures and low water activity. <b>Melanoidins</b> are commonly present in foods that have undergone some form of non-enzymatic browning, such as barley malts (Vienna and Munich), bread crust, bakery products and coffee. They are also present in the wastewater of sugar refineries, necessitating treatment {{in order to avoid}} contamination around the outflow of these refineries.|$|R

However, whether processed plant foods provide the same benefits as unprocessed ones is an open question. <b>Melanoidins</b> from heat-processed apricots were isolated and their presence confirmed by colorimetric analysis and browning index. Oxidative injury of endothelial cells (ECs) is the key step for the onset and progression of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), therefore the potential protective effect of apricot <b>melanoidins</b> on hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative mitochondrial damage and cell death was explored in human ECs. The redox state of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial compartments was detected by using the redox-sensitive, fluorescent protein (roGFP), while the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was assessed with the fluorescent dye, JC- 1. ECs exposure to hydrogen peroxide, dose-dependently induced mitochondrial and cytoplasmic oxidation. Additionally detected hydrogen peroxide-induced phenomena were MMP dissipation and ECs death. Pretreatment of ECs with apricot <b>melanoidins,</b> significantly counteracted and ultimately abolished hydrogen peroxide-induced intracellular oxidation, mitochondrial depolarization and cell death. In this regard, our current results clearly indicate that <b>melanoidins</b> derived from heat-processed apricots, protect human ECs against oxidative stress...|$|R
