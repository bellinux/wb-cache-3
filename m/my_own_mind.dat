500|$|When Cherry-Garrard {{returned}} from One Ton Depot without Scott's party, anxieties rose. Atkinson, {{now in charge}} at Cape Evans as the senior naval officer present, decided to make another attempt to reach the polar party when the weather permitted, and on [...] set out with Keohane, man-hauling a sledge containing 18days' provisions. In very low temperatures (−40°F,−40°C) they had reached Corner Camp by , when, in Atkinson's view, the weather, the cold {{and the time of}} year made further progress south impossible. Atkinson recorded, [...] "In <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mind</b> I was morally certain that the [...] party had perished".|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1902, Eleanor {{encountered}} her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, on a train to Tivoli, New York. The two began a secret correspondence and romance, and became engaged on November 22, 1903. Franklin's mother, Sara Ann Delano, opposed the union, and made him promise that the engagement would not be officially announced for a year. [...] "I know what pain I must have caused you," [...] he wrote his mother of his decision. But, he added, [...] "I know <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mind,</b> and known {{it for a long}} time, and know that I could never think otherwise." [...] Sara took her son on a Caribbean cruise in 1904, hoping that a separation would squelch the romance, but Franklin remained determined. The wedding date was set to accommodate President Theodore Roosevelt, who was scheduled to be in New York City for the St. Patrick's Day parade, and who agreed to give the bride away.|$|E

500|$|Rand {{acknowledged}} Aristotle as {{her greatest}} influence and remarked {{that in the}} history of philosophy she could only recommend [...] "three A's"—Aristotle, Aquinas, and Ayn Rand. In a 1959 interview with Mike Wallace, when asked where her philosophy came from, she responded, [...] "Out of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mind,</b> with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to Aristotle, the only philosopher who ever influenced me. I devised the rest of my philosophy myself." [...] However, she also found early inspiration in Friedrich Nietzsche, and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from Rand's journals, in passages from the first edition of We the Living (which Rand later revised), and in her overall writing style. However, by the time she wrote The Fountainhead, Rand had turned against Nietzsche's ideas, and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed. Among the philosophers Rand held in particular disdain was Immanuel Kant, whom she referred to as a [...] "monster", although philosophers George Walsh and Fred Seddon have argued that she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences.|$|E
500|$|Rob Zombie's contribution, Werewolf Women of the SS, starred Nicolas Cage as Fu Manchu; Udo Kier as Franz Hess, {{the commandant}} of Death Camp 13; Zombie's wife, Sheri; and Sybil Danning as SS officers/sisters Eva and Gretchen Krupp (The She-Devils of Belzac). Professional wrestlers Andrew [...] "Test" [...] Martin and Oleg [...] "Vladimir Kozlov" [...] Prudius also featured, plus Olja Hrustic, Meriah Nelson, and Lorielle New as the Werewolf Women. According to Zombie, [...] "Basically, I had two ideas. It was {{either going to}} be a Nazi movie or a women-in-prison film, and I went with the Nazis. There're all those movies like Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS; Fräulein Devil; and Love Camp 7—I've always found that to be the most bizarre genre." [...] Zombie is also quoted as saying [...] "I was getting very {{conceptual}} in <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mind</b> with it. [...] A lot of times these movies would be made like, 'Well, you know, I've got a whole bunch of Nazi uniforms, but I got this Chinese set too. We'll put 'em together!' They start jamming things in there, so I took that approach." ...|$|E

Let each reader make what he will of her; fancy her of any outward shape and colour that he please, and endow her with any amount of divine beauty. But for her inner character, let him take that from me as I go on, if so be that I can succeed in making clear to others that which is clear enough to <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mind's</b> eye. I have called her a heroine; it is the novelist's customary name for his prima donna, and so I use it. But many opera companies {{have more than one}} prima donna. There is the donna prima, and if one may so say, the donna primissima. Now Adela Guantlet is no more than my donna prima. My donna primissima will be another guess sort of lady altogether.|$|R

2500|$|I am {{perfectly}} convinced in <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mind</b> that Shelley {{never had}} an improper connexion [...] with Claire ... we lived in lodgings where I had momentary entrance into every room and such a thing could not have passed unknown to me ... I do remember that Claire did keep to her bed there for two days – but I attended on her – I saw the physician – her illness was one {{that she had been}} accustomed to for years – and the same remedies were employed as I had before ministered to her in England.|$|E
2500|$|Eliot {{also made}} {{significant}} contributions to the field of literary criticism, strongly influencing the school of New Criticism. He was somewhat self-deprecating and minimising of his work and once said his criticism was merely a [...] "by-product" [...] of his [...] "private poetry-workshop" [...] But the critic William Empson once said, [...] "I do not know for certain how much of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mind</b> [...] invented, let alone {{how much of it is}} a reaction against him or indeed a consequence of misreading him. He is a very penetrating influence, perhaps not unlike the east wind." ...|$|E

5000|$|I {{was much}} troubled in spirit, {{in my first}} years upon the bench, to find how {{trackless}} was the ocean on which I had embarked. I sought for certainty.

I would take a hundred pounds with you; not for <b>my</b> <b>own</b> use, <b>mind,</b> but to lay in a bank in our joint names. You see it makes the {{beginning}} of an account, and we could pay in there all we took, and settle our losses by cheques, which looks much better, and would give us a much better name altogether." ...|$|R
2500|$|While {{working on}} his General Theory, Keynes wrote to George Bernard Shaw [...] "I believe myself to be {{writing a book on}} {{economic}} theory which will largely revolutionize, not I suppose at once but {{in the course of the}} next ten years – the way the world thinks about economic problems ... I don't merely hope what I say, in <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mind</b> I'm quite sure". Keynes's ideas quickly became established as the new foundations for mainstream economics, and also as a leading inspiration for industrial nations economic policy makers from about 1941 to the midseventies, especially in the English speaking countries. The 1950s and 1960s period, when Keynes's influence was at its peak, to many appeared in retrospect to have been a golden age.|$|E
2500|$|After the Boxer Campaign, {{the couple}} had at first {{exchanged}} letters, which Beatty signed 'Jack', as Ethel was still a married woman and discretion was advised. Ethel became involved with another man and the exchange of letters ceased but on Beatty's return she sent him a telegram and letter inviting him to resume their friendship. Beatty did not respond until after surgery on his arm in September 1900 when he wrote, [...] "I landed from China with my heart full of rage, and swore I did not care if I ever saw you again, or if I were killed or not.

40|$|The {{history of}} {{landscape}} {{painting in the}} West has dictated and reiterated a phenomenological point-of-view derived from the Cartesian coordinate plane system. After having journeyed to northern India for eight months, I became influenced by other pictorial conceptions of space, namely the radial cosmological mandalas of Tibetan Buddhism and yantras of Hinduism. Unable to fully eliminate the coordinate plane system from the recess of my mind, I embarked upon a creative journey through consciousness in which <b>my</b> <b>own</b> studio practice provided the means to construct a new orientation, {{not only in terms}} of the perceivable, external world, but within the realm of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> embodied <b>mind...</b>|$|R

6000|$|And what is {{the dire}} {{necessity}} and [...] "iron" [...] law under which men groan? Truly, most gratuitously invented bugbears. I suppose if there be an [...] "iron" [...] law, it is that of gravitation; and if there be a physical necessity, it is that a stone, unsupported, must fall to the ground. But what is all we really know and can know about the latter phænomenon? Simply, that, in all human experience, stones have fallen to the ground under these conditions; {{that we have not}} the smallest reason for believing that any stone so circumstanced will not fall to the ground; and that we have, on the contrary, {{every reason to believe that}} it will so fall. It is very convenient to indicate that all the conditions of belief have been fulfilled in this case, by calling the statement that unsupported stones will fall to the ground, [...] "a law of nature."
