5|$|In eukaryotes, the enzymes in this {{electron}} {{transport system}} use the energy {{released from the}} oxidation of NADH to pump protons across the inner membrane of the <b>mitochondrion.</b> This causes protons to build up in the intermembrane space, and generates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane. The energy stored in this potential is then used by ATP synthase to produce ATP. Oxidative phosphorylation in the eukaryotic <b>mitochondrion</b> is the best-understood example of this process. The <b>mitochondrion</b> is present in almost all eukaryotes, {{with the exception of}} anaerobic protozoa such as Trichomonas vaginalis that instead reduce protons to hydrogen in a remnant <b>mitochondrion</b> called a hydrogenosome.|$|E
5|$|A <b>mitochondrion</b> {{contains}} DNA, {{which is}} organized as several {{copies of a}} single, usually circular, chromosome. This mitochondrial chromosome contains genes for redox proteins, {{such as those of}} the respiratory chain. The CoRR hypothesis proposes that this co-location is required for redox regulation. The mitochondrial genome codes for some RNAs of ribosomes, and the 22 tRNAs necessary for the translation of messenger RNAs into protein. The circular structure is also found in prokaryotes. The proto-mitochondrion was probably closely related to the Rickettsia. However, the exact relationship of the ancestor of mitochondria to the alphaproteobacteria and whether the <b>mitochondrion</b> was formed at the same time or after the nucleus, remains controversial.|$|E
5|$|In the liver, the {{carboxylation}} of cytosolic pyruvate into intra-mitochondrial oxaloacetate is {{an early}} step in the gluconeogenic pathway, which converts lactate and de-aminated alanine into glucose, {{under the influence of}} high levels of glucagon and/or epinephrine in the blood. Here, the addition of oxaloacetate to the <b>mitochondrion</b> does not have a net anaplerotic effect, as another citric acid cycle intermediate (malate) is immediately removed from the <b>mitochondrion</b> to be converted into cytosolic oxaloacetate, which is ultimately converted into glucose, in a process that is almost the reverse of glycolysis.|$|E
5|$|The cytosol or cytoplasmic matrix is {{the liquid}} found inside cells. It {{constitutes}} {{most of the}} intracellular fluid (ICF). It is separated into compartments by membranes. For example, the mitochondrial matrix separates the <b>mitochondrion</b> into many compartments.|$|E
5|$|In the {{citric acid}} cycle, all the {{intermediates}} (e.g. citrate, iso-citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate and oxaloacetate) are regenerated during each {{turn of the}} cycle. Adding more {{of any of these}} intermediates to the <b>mitochondrion</b> therefore means that the additional amount is retained within the cycle, increasing all the other intermediates as one is converted into the other. Hence, the addition of any one of them to the cycle has an anaplerotic effect, and its removal has a cataplerotic effect. These anaplerotic and cataplerotic reactions will, {{during the course of the}} cycle, increase or decrease the amount of oxaloacetate available to combine with acetyl-CoA to form citric acid. This in turn increases or decreases the rate of ATP production by the <b>mitochondrion,</b> and thus the availability of ATP to the cell.|$|E
5|$|The {{reaction}} catalyzed by complex III is the oxidation of one molecule of ubiquinol and {{the reduction}} of two molecules of cytochrome c, a heme protein loosely associated with the <b>mitochondrion.</b> Unlike coenzyme Q, which carries two electrons, cytochrome c carries only one electron.|$|E
5|$|In plants, {{nitrogen}} {{is first}} assimilated into organic compounds {{in the form}} of glutamate, formed from alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia in the <b>mitochondrion.</b> In order to form other amino acids, the plant uses transaminases to move the amino group to another alpha-keto carboxylic acid. For example, aspartate aminotransferase converts glutamate and oxaloacetate to alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate. Other organisms use transaminases for amino acid synthesis, too.|$|E
5|$|Mitochondria divide by binary fission, {{similar to}} {{bacterial}} cell division. The regulation of this division differs between eukaryotes. In many single-celled eukaryotes, their growth and division {{is linked to}} the cell cycle. For example, a single <b>mitochondrion</b> may divide synchronously with the nucleus. This division and segregation process must be tightly controlled so that each daughter cell receives at least one <b>mitochondrion.</b> In other eukaryotes (in mammals for example), mitochondria may replicate their DNA and divide mainly in response to the energy needs of the cell, rather than in phase with the cell cycle. When the energy needs of a cell are high, mitochondria grow and divide. When the energy use is low, mitochondria are destroyed or become inactive. In such examples, and in contrast to the situation in many single celled eukaryotes, mitochondria are apparently randomly distributed to the daughter cells during the division of the cytoplasm. Understanding of mitochondrial dynamics, which is described as the balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission, has revealed that functional and structural alterations in mitochondrial morphology are important factors in pathologies associated with several disease conditions.|$|E
5|$|Pumping protons {{out of the}} {{mitochondria}} {{creates a}} proton concentration difference across the membrane and generates an electrochemical gradient. This force drives protons back into the <b>mitochondrion</b> through the base of an enzyme called ATP synthase. The flow of protons makes the stalk subunit rotate, causing the active site of the synthase domain to change shape and phosphorylate adenosine diphosphateâ€“ turning it into ATP.|$|E
5|$|The human {{mitochondrial}} genome is {{a circular}} DNA molecule of about 16 kilobases. It encodes 37 genes: 13 for subunits of respiratory complexes I, III, IV and V, 22 for mitochondrial tRNA (for the 20 standard amino acids, plus an extra gene for leucine and serine), and 2 for rRNA. One <b>mitochondrion</b> can contain two to ten copies of its DNA.|$|E
5|$|The matrix is {{the space}} {{enclosed}} by the inner membrane. It contains about 2/3 {{of the total}} protein in a <b>mitochondrion.</b> The matrix {{is important in the}} production of ATP with the aid of the ATP synthase contained in the inner membrane. The matrix contains a highly concentrated mixture of hundreds of enzymes, special mitochondrial ribosomes, tRNA, and several copies of the mitochondrial DNA genome. Of the enzymes, the major functions include oxidation of pyruvate and fatty acids, and the citric acid cycle.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} roles of mitochondria are {{to produce the}} energy currency of the cell, ATP (i.e., phosphorylation of ADP), through respiration, and to regulate cellular metabolism. The central set of reactions involved in ATP production are collectively known as the citric acid cycle, or the Krebs cycle. However, the <b>mitochondrion</b> has many other functions {{in addition to the}} production of ATP.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{exhibit a}} great variety of {{chemical}} reactions in their metabolism and use many sources of energy. These reactions are classified into nutritional groups, depending on energy and carbon sources. Some archaea obtain energy from inorganic compounds such as sulfur or ammonia (they are lithotrophs). These include nitrifiers, methanogens and anaerobic methane oxidisers. In these reactions one compound passes electrons to another (in a redox reaction), releasing energy to fuel the cell's activities. One compound acts as an electron donor and one as an electron acceptor. The energy released is used to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through chemiosmosis, the same basic process that happens in the <b>mitochondrion</b> of eukaryotic cells.|$|E
5|$|Most lipids are {{synthesized}} in yeast {{either in}} the endoplasmic reticulum, lipid particles, or the <b>mitochondrion,</b> {{with little or no}} lipid synthesis occurring in the plasma membrane or nuclear membrane. Sphingolipid biosynthesis begins in the endoplasmic reticulum, but is completed in the Golgi apparatus. The situation is similar in mammals, {{with the exception of the}} first few steps in ether lipid biosynthesis, which occur in peroxisomes. The various membranes that enclose the other subcellular organelles must therefore be constructed by transfer of lipids from these sites of synthesis. However, although it is clear that lipid transport is a central process in organelle biogenesis, the mechanisms by which lipids are transported through cells remain poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|The {{generation}} of ATP by the <b>mitochondrion</b> from cytosolic NADH {{relies on the}} malate-aspartate shuttle (and to a lesser extent, the glycerol-phosphate shuttle) because the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD+. Instead of transferring the generated NADH, a malate dehydrogenase enzyme converts oxaloacetate to malate, which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix. Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite direction, producing oxaloacetate and NADH from the newly transported malate and the mitochondrion's interior store of NAD+. A transaminase converts the oxaloacetate to aspartate for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the endomembrane system {{is linked to the}} origin of eukaryotes {{themselves}} and the origin of eukaryoties to the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria. Many models have been put forward to explain the {{origin of the}} endomembrane system (reviewed in). The most recent concept suggests that the endomembrane system evolved from outer membrane vesicles the endosymbiotic <b>mitochondrion</b> secreted. This OMV-based model for the origin of the endomembrane system is currently the one that requires the least amount of novel inventions at eukaryote origin and explains the many connections of mitochondria with other compartments of the cell.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{well-known}} drugs and toxins that inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. Although {{any one of}} these toxins inhibits only one enzyme in the electron transport chain, inhibition of any step in this process will halt the rest of the process. For example, if oligomycin inhibits ATP synthase, protons cannot pass back into the <b>mitochondrion.</b> As a result, the proton pumps are unable to operate, as the gradient becomes too strong for them to overcome. NADH is then no longer oxidized and the citric acid cycle ceases to operate because the concentration of NAD+ falls below the concentration that these enzymes can use.|$|E
5|$|It {{contains}} more than 151 different polypeptides, and has a very high protein-to-phospholipid ratio (more than 3:1 by weight, which is about 1protein for 15phospholipids). The inner membrane is home to around 1/5 of the total protein in a <b>mitochondrion.</b> In addition, the inner membrane is rich in an unusual phospholipid, cardiolipin. This phospholipid was originally discovered in cow hearts in 1942, and is usually characteristic of mitochondrial and bacterial plasma membranes. Cardiolipin contains four fatty acids rather than two, and may help to make the inner membrane impermeable. Unlike the outer membrane, the inner membrane doesn't contain porins, and is highly impermeable to all molecules. Almost all ions and molecules require special membrane transporters to enter or exit the matrix. Proteins are ferried into the matrix via the translocase of the inner membrane (TIM) complex or via Oxa1. In addition, there is a membrane potential across the inner membrane, formed {{by the action of}} the enzymes of the electron transport chain.|$|E
5|$|Making these {{predictions}} is not trivial, {{even for}} simple systems. For example, oxaloacetate is formed by malate dehydrogenase within the <b>mitochondrion.</b> Oxaloacetate {{can then be}} consumed by citrate synthase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase or aspartate aminotransferase, feeding into the citric acid cycle, gluconeogenesis or aspartic acid biosynthesis, respectively. Being able to predict how much oxaloacetate goes into which pathway requires knowledge of the concentration of oxaloacetate {{as well as the}} concentration and kinetics of each of these enzymes. This aim of predicting the behaviour of metabolic pathways reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms. Alternatively, one useful simplification of the metabolic modelling problem is to ignore the underlying enzyme kinetics and only rely on information about the reaction network's stoichiometry, a technique called flux balance analysis.|$|E
5|$|Many catabolic {{biochemical}} processes, such as glycolysis, the {{citric acid}} cycle, and beta oxidation, produce the reduced coenzyme NADH. This coenzyme contains electrons {{that have a}} high transfer potential; in other words, they will release {{a large amount of}} energy upon oxidation. However, the cell does not release this energy all at once, as this would be an uncontrollable reaction. Instead, the electrons are removed from NADH and passed to oxygen through a series of enzymes that each release a small amount of the energy. This set of enzymes, consisting of complexes I through IV, is called the electron transport chain and is found in the inner membrane of the <b>mitochondrion.</b> Succinate is also oxidized by the electron transport chain, but feeds into the pathway at a different point.|$|E
5|$|The redox {{reactions}} catalyzed by oxidoreductases {{are vital}} {{in all parts}} of metabolism, but one particularly important area where these reactions occur is in the release of energy from nutrients. Here, reduced compounds such as glucose and fatty acids are oxidized, thereby releasing energy. This energy is transferred to NAD by reduction to NADH, as part of beta oxidation, glycolysis, and the citric acid cycle. In eukaryotes the electrons carried by the NADH that is produced in the cytoplasm are transferred into the <b>mitochondrion</b> (to reduce mitochondrial NAD) by mitochondrial shuttles, such as the malate-aspartate shuttle. The mitochondrial NADH is then oxidized in turn by the electron transport chain, which pumps protons across a membrane and generates ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. These shuttle systems also have the same transport function in chloroplasts.|$|E
5|$|Uniparental {{inheritance}} {{leads to}} little opportunity for genetic recombination between different lineages of mitochondria, although a single <b>mitochondrion</b> can contain 2â€“10 copies of its DNA. For this reason, mitochondrial DNA is usually thought to reproduce by binary fission. What recombination does take place maintains genetic integrity rather than maintaining diversity. However, there are studies showing evidence of recombination in mitochondrial DNA. It {{is clear that}} the enzymes necessary for recombination are present in mammalian cells. Further, evidence suggests that animal mitochondria can undergo recombination. The data are a bit more controversial in humans, although indirect evidence of recombination exists. If recombination does not occur, the whole mitochondrial DNA sequence represents a single haplotype, which makes it useful for studying the evolutionary history of populations.|$|E
5|$|As in prokaryotes, {{there is}} a very high {{proportion}} of coding DNA and an absence of repeats. Mitochondrial genes are transcribed as multigenic transcripts, which are cleaved and polyadenylated to yield mature mRNAs. Not all proteins necessary for mitochondrial function are encoded by the mitochondrial genome; most are coded by genes in the cell nucleus and the corresponding proteins are imported into the <b>mitochondrion.</b> The exact number of genes encoded by the nucleus and the mitochondrial genome differs between species. Most mitochondrial genomes are circular, although exceptions have been reported. In general, mitochondrial DNA lacks introns, {{as is the case in}} the human mitochondrial genome; however, introns have been observed in some eukaryotic mitochondrial DNA, such as that of yeast and protists, including Dictyostelium discoideum. Between protein-coding regions, tRNAs are present. During transcription, the tRNAs acquire their characteristic L-shape that gets recognized and cleaved by specific enzymes. Mitochondrial tRNA genes have different sequences from the nuclear tRNAs but lookalikes of mitochondrial tRNAs have been found in the nuclear chromosomes with high sequence similarity.|$|E
5|$|Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are a {{class of}} closely related enzymes that {{catalyze}} {{the breakdown of the}} superoxide anion into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. SOD enzymes are present in almost all aerobic cells and in extracellular fluids. Superoxide dismutase enzymes contain metal ion cofactors that, depending on the isozyme, can be copper, zinc, manganese or iron. In humans, the copper/zinc SOD is present in the cytosol, while manganese SOD is present in the <b>mitochondrion.</b> There also exists a third form of SOD in extracellular fluids, which contains copper and zinc in its active sites. The mitochondrial isozyme seems to be the most biologically important of these three, since mice lacking this enzyme die soon after birth. In contrast, the mice lacking copper/zinc SOD (Sod1) are viable but have numerous pathologies and a reduced lifespan (see article on superoxide), while mice without the extracellular SOD have minimal defects (sensitive to hyperoxia). In plants, SOD isozymes are present in the cytosol and mitochondria, with an iron SOD found in chloroplasts that is absent from vertebrates and yeast.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{mitochondrial}} membrane, which encloses {{the entire}} organelle, is 60 to 75 angstroms (Ã…) thick. It has a protein-to-phospholipid ratio {{similar to that}} of the eukaryotic plasma membrane (about 1:1 by weight). It contains large numbers of integral membrane proteins called porins. These porins form channels that allow molecules of 5000daltons or less in molecular weight to freely diffuse from one side of the membrane to the other. Larger proteins can enter the <b>mitochondrion</b> if a signaling sequence at their N-terminus binds to a large multisubunit protein called translocase of the outer membrane, which then actively moves them across the membrane. Mitochondrial pro-proteins are imported through specialised translocation complexes. The outer membrane also contains enzymes involved in such diverse activities as the elongation of fatty acids, oxidation of epinephrine, and the degradation of tryptophan. These enzymes include monoamine oxidase, rotenone-insensitive NADH-cytochrome c-reductase, kynurenine hydroxylase and fatty acid Co-A ligase. Disruption of the outer membrane permits proteins in the intermembrane space to leak into the cytosol, leading to certain cell death. The mitochondrial outer membrane can associate with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, in a structure called MAM (mitochondria-associated ER-membrane). This is important in the ER-mitochondria calcium signaling and is involved in the transfer of lipids between the ER and mitochondria.|$|E
5|$|Mitochondria (and related structures) {{are found}} in all eukaryotes (except oneâ€”the Oxymonad Monocercomonoides sp.). Although {{commonly}} depicted as bean-like structures they form a highly dynamic network {{in the majority of}} cells where they constantly undergo fission and fusion. Mitochondria vary in number and location according to cell type. A single <b>mitochondrion</b> is often found in unicellular organisms. Conversely, numerous mitochondria {{are found in}} human liver cells, with about 1000â€“2000 mitochondria per cell, making up 1/5 of the cell volume. The population of all the mitochondria of a given cell constitutes the chondriome. The mitochondrial content of otherwise similar cells can vary substantially in size and membrane potential, with differences arising from sources including uneven partitioning at cell divisions, leading to extrinsic differences in ATP levels and downstream cellular processes. The mitochondria can be found nestled between myofibrils of muscle or wrapped around the sperm flagellum. Often, they form a complex 3D branching network inside the cell with the cytoskeleton. The association with the cytoskeleton determines mitochondrial shape, which can affect the function as well: different structures of the mitochondrial network may afford the population a variety of physical, chemical, and signalling advantages or disadvantages. Mitochondria in cells are always distributed along microtubules and the distribution of these organelles is also correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Recent evidence suggests that vimentin, one of the components of the cytoskeleton, is also critical to the association with the cytoskeleton.|$|E
25|$|The genome of the <b>mitochondrion</b> of the {{cucumber}} (Cucumis sativus) {{consists of}} three circular chromosomes (lengths 1556, 84 and 45 kilobases), which are entirely or largely autonomous {{with regard to their}} replication.|$|E
25|$|In total, the <b>mitochondrion</b> hosts about 3000 {{different}} types of proteins, but only about 13 of them are coded on the mitochondrial DNA. Most of the 3000 types of proteins {{are involved in a}} variety of processes other than ATP production, such as porphyrin synthesis. Only about 3% of them code for ATP production proteins. This means most of the genetic information coding for the protein makeup of mitochondria is in chromosomal DNA and is involved in processes other than ATP synthesis. This increases the chances that a mutation that will affect a <b>mitochondrion</b> will occur in chromosomal DNA, which is inherited in a Mendelian pattern. Another result is that a chromosomal mutation will affect a specific tissue due to its specific needs, whether those may be high energy requirements or a need for the catabolism or anabolism of a specific neurotransmitter or nucleic acid. Because several copies of the mitochondrial genome are carried by each <b>mitochondrion</b> (2â€“10 in humans), mitochondrial mutations can be inherited maternally by mtDNA mutations which are present in mitochondria inside the oocyte before fertilization, or (as stated above) through mutations in the chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|To cataplerotically remove {{oxaloacetate}} {{from the}} citric cycle, malate can be transported from the <b>mitochondrion</b> into the cytoplasm, decreasing {{the amount of}} oxaloacetate that can be regenerated. Furthermore, citric acid intermediates are constantly used to form a variety of substances such as the purines, pyrimidines and porphyrins.|$|E
25|$|Chloroplasts are {{believed}} to have arisen after mitochondria, since all eukaryotes contain mitochondria, but not all have chloroplasts. This is called serial endosymbiosisâ€”an early eukaryote engulfing the <b>mitochondrion</b> ancestor, and some descendants of it then engulfing the chloroplast ancestor, creating a cell with both chloroplasts and mitochondria.|$|E
25|$|Plasmodium species {{each have}} 14 {{chromosomes}} in the nucleus, {{as well as}} genetic material in the <b>mitochondrion</b> and in the apicoplast. The chromosomes vary from 500 kilobases to 3.5 megabases in length. The apicoplast is involved in isoprenoid metabolism, Fe-S cluster synthesis, fatty acid synthesis, and phospholipid biosynthesis.|$|E
25|$|The {{pyruvate}} {{produced by}} glycolysis {{is an important}} intermediary in the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids and cholesterol. This occurs via the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA in the <b>mitochondrion.</b> However, this acetyl CoA needs to be transported into cytosol where the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol occurs. This cannot occur directly. To obtain cytosolic acetyl-CoA, citrate (produced by the condensation of acetyl CoA with oxaloacetate) {{is removed from the}} citric acid cycle and carried across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol. There it is cleaved by ATP citrate lyase into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. The oxaloacetate can be used for gluconeogenesis (in the liver), or it can be returned into <b>mitochondrion</b> as malate. The cytosolic acetyl-CoA is carboxylated by acetyl CoA carboxylase into malonyl CoA, the first committed step in the synthesis of fatty acids.|$|E
25|$|In humans, {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) forms closed circular {{molecules that}} contain 16,569 DNA base pairs, with each such molecule normally containing {{a full set}} of the mitochondrial genes. Each human <b>mitochondrion</b> contains, on average, approximately 5 such mtDNA molecules, with the quantity ranging between 1 and 15. Each human cell contains approximately 100 mitochondria, giving a total number of mtDNA molecules per human cell of approximately 500.|$|E
25|$|The Mitochondrial DNA Polymerase (Pol gamma, encoded by the POLG gene) {{is used in}} the copying of mtDNA during replication. Because the two (heavy and light) strands on the {{circular}} mtDNA molecule have different origins of replication, it replicates in a D-loop mode. One strand begins to replicate first, displacing the other strand. This continues until replication reaches the origin of replication on the other strand, at which point the other strand begins replicating in the opposite direction. This results in two new mtDNA molecules. Each <b>mitochondrion</b> has several copies of the mtDNA molecule and the number of mtDNA molecules is a limiting factor in mitochondrial fission. After the <b>mitochondrion</b> has enough mtDNA, membrane area, and membrane proteins, it can undergo fission (very similar to that which bacteria use) to become two mitochondria. Evidence suggests that mitochondria can also undergo fusion and exchange (in a form of crossover) genetic material among each other. Mitochondria sometimes form large matrices in which fusion, fission, and protein exchanges are constantly occurring. mtDNA shared among mitochondria (despite the fact that they can undergo fusion).|$|E
25|$|The acetyl-CoA {{produced}} by beta oxidation enters the citric acid cycle in the <b>mitochondrion</b> by combining with oxaloacetate to form citrate. This {{results in the}} complete combustion of the acetyl-CoA to CO2 and water. The energy released in this process is captured {{in the form of}} 1 GTP and 11 ATP molecules per acetyl-CoA molecule oxidized. This is the fate of acetyl-CoA wherever beta oxidation of fatty acids occurs, except under certain circumstances in the liver.|$|E
25|$|The theory {{suggests}} that an anaerobic cell probably ingested an aerobic bacterium but failed to digest it. The aerobic bacterium flourished within the cell because the cell's cytoplasm was abundant in half-digested food molecules. The bacterium digested these molecules with oxygen and gained great amounts of energy. Because the bacterium had so much energy, it probably leaked some of it as adenosine triphosphate into the cell's cytoplasm. This benefited the anaerobic cell because it was now able to breathe aerobically, which means more potential for energy gain. Eventually, the aerobic bacterium could no longer live independently from the cell, and it, therefore, became a <b>mitochondrion.</b> The origin of the chloroplast {{is very similar to}} that of the <b>mitochondrion.</b> A cell must have captured a photosynthetic cyanobacterium and failed to digest it. The cyanobacterium thrived in the cell and eventually evolved into the first chloroplast. Other eukaryotic organelles may have also evolved through endosymbiosis; it has been proposed that cilia, flagella, centrioles, and microtubules may have originated from a symbiosis between a Spirochaete bacterium and an early eukaryotic cell, but this is not widely accepted among biologists.|$|E
