40|$|Allan <b>Meltzer</b> <b>s</b> {{career in}} {{economics}} has featured outstandingcontributions in an astonishingly {{wide range of}} activities. As thebasis of all of these, of course, lies his work in economic research. Perhaps most well known is Allan s long line of papers in monetaryeconomics, many written together with Karl Brunner, which helped toestablish the broad and widely accepted approach once known asmonetarism. But several other areas have, at different times,attracted his main research efforts; among these are business-cycleanalysis, financial intermediation, analytical political economy, andthe history of economic thought. Recently, he has become deeplyimmersed in a major historical project the writing of an extensivehistory of the Federal Reserve System and its monetary policymaking. A second type of outstanding accomplishment has been Allan Meltzer swork as a conference-series creator and organizer. In the 1970 s, heand Karl Brunner founded the Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series onPublic Policy, which has been unusually fruitful as an incubator ofnew ideas and talent. Together, Brunner and Meltzer also founded theInterlaken Seminar on Analysis and Ideology, which for many yearsbrought together economists, political philosophers, and other socialscientists. Allan was {{a major contributor to}} Brunner s organizationof the Konstanz Seminar on Monetary Theory and Policy still acreative force in European economics and with colleagues he createdand ran the Carnegie Mellon Conference on Political Economy from 1979 to 1990. As if all this were not enough for three or four normal beings, Allanand Karl created the Shadow Open Market Committee. At its inceptionthis was a unique institution, but it has since served as a model forother groups designed to provide policy analysis for a wider publicaudience. In terms of that latter objective, Allan has been andcontinues {{to be one of the}} economists most frequently sought out andquoted in the national and international press. He maintains anamazingly fresh and extensive store of knowledge about economic andsocial affairs the world over, one that he shares generously withother scholars. Allan Meltzer has not spent much time in full-time governmentalpositions, but has served extensively as a consultant or advisor to the U. S. Treasury and theCouncil of Economic Advisors, as well asofficial agencies in several other nations, including most notablythe Bank of Japan. Also he has for several years spent a good bit oftime at the American Enterprise Institute. For over 40 years, however, his principal professional home has been the Graduate Schoolof Industrial Administration at Carnegie Mellon University. From the foregoing account, it will be obvious that Allan Meltzer isequipped with an enormous supply of energy and enthusiasm, as well asanalytical ability. A closely related characteristic, familiar toall those who are lucky enough to spend time with him, is anunfailing attitude of optimism and cheerfulness. My interview with Allan took place on May 14, 1997, in his office,with its pleasant corner location in the new wing of GSIA s building. We talked in the afternoon and continued somewhat longer thanintended because there was so much of interest to discuss. Evenafter 16 years of having nearby offices andmultiple conversations on dayswhen we both are in Pittsburgh I found it instructive and enjoyableto learn more about Allan <b>Meltzer</b> <b>s</b> remarkable career.

40|$|TThe {{subspecialty}} {{of pediatric}} anesthesia {{has come a}} long way since its origin in Jefferson, Georgia, when Dr. Crawford Long administered the first documented ether anesthetic to an 8 -year-old boy for a toe amputation on July 3, 1842. 1 Thus began the practice of pediatric anesthesia in the hands of an observant rural physician. Dr. Long, however, did not publish his anesthetic practice until three years after William T. G. Morton, a dentist, performed the first demonstration of ether anesthesia at Massachusetts General Hospital. Overseas, Dr. John Snow in London advanced the practice even further by providing chloroform anesthesia to infants under the age of 1. In capable hands, this practice was a success, but in those less experienced, chloroform produced fatal hypotension and cardiac arrests. 2 From the very beginning, it was clear that children were at higher risk than adults for anesthesia-related complications and death because of differences in their physiology, anatomy and functional development. Indeed, between the 1840 s and the 1940 <b>s,</b> <b>anesthesia</b> for children was such a risky endeavor that few parents, surgeons o...|$|R

However, studies of several infectious, allergic, and autoimmune diseases {{have shown that}} chronic type- 1 and type- 2 cytokine responses can also cause significant morbidity and mortality if left unchecked. We used mouse cDNA microarrays to molecularly phenotype the gene expression patterns that characterize two disparate but equally lethal forms of liver pathology that develop in Schistosoma mansoni infected mice polarized for type- 1 and type- 2 cytokine responses. Hierarchical clustering analysis identified at least three groups of genes associated with a polarized type- 2 response and two linked with an extreme type- 1 cytokine phenotype. Predictions about liver fibrosis, apoptosis, and granulocyte recruitment and activation generated by the microarray studies were confirmed later by traditional biological assays. The data show that cDNA microarrays are useful not only for determining coordinated gene expression profiles but are also highly effective for molecularly ?fingerprinting? diseased tissues.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Propofol is an {{intravenous}} anesthetic used worldwide as an anesthesia induction {{and maintenance}} agent. Propofol also used as sedation agent in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Despite it 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> usual <b>anesthesia</b> properties, propofol has an unique pharmacologic characteristic, especially as antioxidant and stress response reduction. These advantages suggested propofol has positive effects when {{used as an}} anesthesia agent in surgery or sedation in ICU in conditions when high stress and free radical level are released. CONTENT:Stress response and free radical can be elevated in various conditions including surgery or during care in ICU, especially critical ill patient. Cortisol is a major stress hormone that influences metabolism, cardiovascular and central nervous system, either in acute or chronic phase. Oxidative stress was marked by free radical elevation called Radical Oxygen Species (ROS). Combination of both elements (cortisol and ROS) can worsen patient condition. Propofol with anti-stress and antioxidant properties {{could be used to}} reduce stress response and attenuate free radical level in order to improve patient condition.

40|$|Background: Unlike most anesthetics, {{ketamine}} racemate (S,R() -ketamine) induces heterogenous {{changes in}} cerebral metabolism. S,R() -ketamine is an equimolar mixture of two enantiomers, S() -ketamine and R() -ketamine, which differ in afﬁnity for neuroreceptors and pharmacologic activities. This study investigated comparatively {{the effects of}} ketamine racemate and enantiomers on cerebral metabolism. Methods: Regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (rCMRglc) were determined with the quantitative, autoradio- graphic [14 C] 2 -deoxy-D-glucose technique in 40 brain regions of Fischer- 344 rats. rCMRglc were measured in three groups of rats during equimolar anesthesia, 10 min after intraperitoneal injection of 170 mg/kg S,R() -ketamine, S() -ketamine, or R() -ketamine; in three groups of rats during recovery from equivalent anesthesia, 20 min after intravenous injection of 20, 12. 5, and 30 mg/kg S,R() -ketamine, S() -ketamine, or R() -ketamine; and in two groups of sa line-injected control rats. Results: S,R() -ketamine and S() -ketamine induced a sus-tained anesthesia; deep rCMRglc decreases in 22 and 14 cortical, thalamic, cerebellar, and brainstem regions; and rCMRglc in-creases in two limbic regions (average decreases, 23 and 15 %). R() -ketamine determined a shorter anesthesia, lesser rCMRglc decreases in 11 brain areas, and marked rCMRglc increases in 14 basal ganglia and limbic regions (average decrease, 4 %). S,R() -ketamine, S() -ketamine, and R() -ketamine all produced postanesthetic behavioral activation; widespread rCMRglc in-creases in 28, 16, and 20 cortical, thalamic, basal ganglia, limbic, and brainstem regions; and rCMRglc decreases in few auditory and limbic regions (average increases, 35, 13, and 20 %). Conclusions: S,R() -ketamine and <b>S()</b> -ketamine <b>anesthesia</b> but not R() -ketamine anesthesia induced widespread rCMRglc reductions that were unreported but are typical of gaseous and intravenous general anesthetics. Postanesthetic recovery led to divergent, sharp behavioral and rCMRglc activations.

Patients and methods 50 Adult patients scheduled for meniscectomy were randomly assigned into two groups: TIVA group (Group T: n= 25), and VIMA group (Group V: n= 25). A blood sample was collected 24 h before surgery (Sbasal). The first sample on the day of operation was collected just before the induction of <b>anesthesia</b> (<b>S</b> 1), then 3 h later after induction (S 2), and lastly 24 h after surgery (S 3). CRP levels were assayed and T-lymphocyte subpopulations were investigated by flow-cytometry. ResultsCRP was increased at (S 1) and reached its maximum levels at (S 3) in both groups. CRP levels at (S 3) were significantly higher in TIVA compared to VIMA groups. A significant decrease in the percentage of CD 3, CD 4 and decreased CD 4 /CD 8 ratio occurred at (S 2) and (S 3) in both groups but more significantly with TIVA.

Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study in a university hospital setting. The participants were patients admitted for hip fracture (n = 98) or for elective surgery (n = 50). Delirium was assessed daily perioperatively in hip fracture patients using the Confusion Assessment Method. A consensus-based diagnosis of prefracture dementia was made using all available information. CSF was drawn {{at the onset of}} spinal <b>anesthesia.</b> <b>S</b> 100 B and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) concentrations were measured using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, respectively. Results: In the hip fracture population (n = 98) {{there was no significant difference}} in CSF S 100 B concentrations between patients with ongoing preoperative (i. e., prevalent) delirium (n = 36, median [interquartile range] 1. 11 μg/L [0. 91 – 1. 29]) and patients who never developed delirium (n = 46, 1. 08 μg/L [0. 92 – 1. 28], p = 0. 92). In patients without preoperative delirium, those who developed delirium postoperatively (i. e., incident delirium) (n = 16, 1. 38 μg/L [1. 08 – 1. 62]) had higher concentrations of S 100 B than the 46 who never did (p = 0. 013). This difference was confined to patients with pathological concentrations of P-tau (≥ 60 ng/L, n = 38). We also found that P-tau and S 100 B were correlated in CSF in the elective surgery patients.

The {{aim of the}} study was to investigate the effects of different anesthesia techniques on oxidative stress caused by tourniquetinduced ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury during extremity operations at children's age. Methods. The study included 45 patients American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification I or II, 8 to 17 years of age, undergoing orthopedic procedures that required bloodless limb surgery. The children were randomized into three groups of 15 patients each: general inhalational anesthesia with sevoflurane (group <b>S),</b> total intravenous <b>anesthesia</b> with propofol (group T) and regional anesthesia (group R). Venous blood samples were obtained at four time points: before peripheral nerve block and induction of general anesthesia (baseline), 1 min before tourniquet release (BTR), 5 and 20 min after tourniquet release (ATR). Postischemic reperfusion injury was estimated by measurement of concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) in plasma and erythrocytes as well as catalase (CAT) activity. Results. Plasma MDA concentration in the group S was significantly higher at 20 min ATR in comparison with the groups T and R (6. 78 ± 0. 33 μmolL- 1 - 1 vs 4. 07 ± 1. 53 and 3. 22 ± 0. 9. μmolL- 1 - 1, respectively). There was a significant difference in MDA concentration in erytrocythes between the groups S and T after 5 min of reperfusion (5. 88 ± 0. 88 vs 4. 27 ± 1. 04 nmol/mlEr, p < 0. 05). Although not statistically significant, CAT activity was slightly increased as compared to baseline in both groups S and R. In the group T, CAT activity decreased at all time points when compared with baseline, but the observed decrease was only statistically significant at BTR (34. 70 ± 9. 27 vs 39. 69 ± 12. 91 UL- 1, p < 0. 05).

40|$|Background & Goal: To {{study the}} {{response}} to acute hypoxia in micro- and macrocirculatory variables during propofol- (PROPO) vs. sevoflurane- (SEVO) anesthesia. Materials and methods: In randomized cross over design, chronically instrumented dogs (24 - 32 kg, n= 6 per group) were anesthetized with PROPO or SEVO (equi-anesthetic dosages), mechanically ventilated (FiO 2 ~ 0. 3) and underwent a hypoxemic episode (FiO 2 ~ 0. 1 for 15 min [1]), followed by normoxic recovery (FiO 2 ~ 0. 3; 90 min). Microcirculatory perfusion of oral mucosa (µ-mucosa) and hindlimb skin (µ-skin) were measured by laser Doppler fluxmetry. Regional gastric intraluminal PCO 2 (PgiCO 2) was measured by tonometry. Macro-hemodynamics (cardiac output (CO), blood pressures), metabolism (O 2 -consumption (VO 2); indirect alorimetry) and blood-derived variables (art. O 2 -content (CaO 2), acid/base variables) were also measured. Statistics: Data are mean±sem for n= 6 experiments per group, and compared by two-way-ANOVA, corrected for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni). A p< 0. 05 was significant. Results and Discussion: During normoxia, both CO and CaO 2  were similar (both N. S.) under PROPO and SEVO. In addition, the hypoxia model achieved comparable drops in CaO 2  (N. <b>S.)</b> under both <b>anesthesia</b> types. However, hypoxia elicited markedly different responses between PROPO and SEVO: Hypoxia during PROPO significantly increased µ-mucosa and µ-skin, but decreased both during SEVO. After hypoxia under PROPO, PgiCO 2  was preserved, whereas under SEVO, PgiCO 2  significantly accumulated. During PROPO, hypoxia generally stimulated macro-hemodynamics (e. g., CO increased from 86 ± 3 to 123 ± 8 ml/kg/min), whereas in contrast during SEVO-hypoxia hemodynamics were unresponsive (CO, 72 ± 8 vs. 71 ± 6 ml/kg/min) or even depressed. On the metabolic level, VO 2  was maintained during PROPO/hypoxia, but significantly decreased with SEVO/hypoxia. Conclusion:  In this dog model, only PROPO permitted hemodynamic stimulation by acute hypoxia, resulting in (compensatory) increased micro- and macrocirculatory perfusion. In line, PROPO-hypoxia maintained VO 2  , without aggravating anaerobiosis markers (lactate), and with preservation of PgiCO 2. In contrast, SEVO failed to permit hemodynamic stimulation by hypoxia and failed to preserve PgiCO 2. If our data can {{be transferred to the}} clinical setting, PROPO appears beneficial (vs. SEVO) to support the systemic and regional circulation during acute hypoxia. Reference: 1.

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that {{preoperative}} stress is associated with poorer health outcomes in adults and young children, {{but there is little}} in the literature about the stress experienced by adolescents. Clinical experience, however, {{has shown that}} adolescents behave differently throughout the perioperative experience than either adults or children. For example, common behaviors of adolescent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> emerging from <b>anesthesia</b> include combativeness, thrashing, and crying. To promote adolescent health and to provide adolescents with appropriate interventions that will support a positive surgical outcome, research is needed to discover the perceptions and meanings adolescents attribute to the perioperative experience. The purpose of this hermeneutic phenomenological study was to describe and capture the meaning of perioperative experiences of adolescents. The research question for this study was 2 ̆ 2 What is the meaning of the perioperative experience to adolescents? 2 ̆ 2 Max van Manen 2 ̆ 7 s phenomenological approach especially guided uncovering the descriptions of the meanings provided by the participants through the lifeworld: lived body, lived relation, lived space, and lived time. Although the lifeworld provided a way to interpret the perioperative experience, the Neuman Systems Model (NSM) allowed for further exploration of the perioperative experience. Nine female adolescents, ages 18 to 20 years, undergoing a surgical procedure were interviewed twice: once preoperative and once postoperative. The themes for the perioperative experience of adolescents 2 ̆ 7 were 2 ̆ 2 I knew that [...] . 2 ̆ 2 and feelings of apprehension for the preoperative experience. Following the surgical procedure, themes gleaned from the postoperative stories were 2 ̆ 2 not as bad as I thought 2 ̆ 2, concern, and 2 ̆ 2 I needed my mom. 2 ̆ 2 What the stories told was that much like adults and children, the overall perioperative experience was stressful for the adolescent. However, the developmental concerns unique to adolescents added another layer to the meaning of this experience. Specifically, issues with autonomy and loss of control were gleaned from the stories shared by the adolescent about their perioperative experience. This study is significant because it generated new knowledge that could facilitate development of interventions specific to the needs and concerns of adolescents undergoing a surgical procedure. It is unique as {{it is one of the}} few studies that explored the preoperative experience through the voices of adolescents and compared and contrasted the preoperative and postoperative experiences...|$|R
