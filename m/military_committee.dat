5|$|In 1962, the <b>military</b> <b>committee</b> of the Syrian Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party {{spent most}} of its time plannining to take power through a {{conventional}} military coup. The <b>military</b> <b>committee</b> decided it had to capture al-Kiswah and Qatana, two military camps, seize control of the 70th Armoured Brigade at al-Kiswah, the Military Academy {{in the city of}} Homs and the Damascus radio station. While the conspirators of the <b>military</b> <b>committee</b> were all young, the sitting regime had been slowly disintegrating and the traditional elite had lost effective political power.|$|E
5|$|NATO's {{military}} operations are {{directed by the}} Chairman of the NATO <b>Military</b> <b>Committee,</b> and split into two Strategic Commands commanded by a senior US officer and (currently) a senior French officer assisted by a staff drawn from across NATO. The Strategic Commanders are responsible to the <b>Military</b> <b>Committee</b> for the overall direction and conduct of all Alliance military matters within their areas of command.|$|E
5|$|While it {{planned the}} coup, the <b>military</b> <b>committee</b> {{and its members}} were frowned upon by {{civilian}} Ba'athists. The reason for the army–party alliance {{in the first place}} was to safeguard the party from repression. The <b>military</b> <b>committee</b> did not look favourably on the civilian leadership led by Michel Aflaq, objecting to his dissolution the Ba'ath Party during the UAR years. While Aflaq needed the <b>military</b> <b>committee</b> to seize power, the committee needed Aflaq to hold on power – without Aflaq they would have no support base. At the 5th National Ba'ath Party Congress, held on 8 May 1962, it was decided to reestablish the party and keep Aflaq as Secretary General of the National Command. Muhammad Umran, a leading member of the <b>military</b> <b>committee,</b> was a delegate at the 5th National Congress, and told Aflaq of the military committee's intentions – Aflaq consented to the coup, but no agreement was made between him and the committee on how to share power after the coup.|$|E

The Russian invasion command in Trabzon provided the logistic support for the Greek <b>military</b> <b>committees.</b> From 1916 to 1918, the Greek <b>military</b> <b>committees</b> set road blocks, raided Muslim villages, transported goods, and overrun the food warehouses. The activities of Greek <b>military</b> <b>committees</b> prepared the substructure for the Pontus idea to be realized, which became more apparent during the National War of Liberation...|$|R
5|$|On October 3, 1945, {{the bill}} was {{introduced}} in the House of Representatives by Congressman Andrew J. May from Kentucky, the chairman of the House <b>Military</b> Affairs <b>Committee,</b> and in the Senate by Senator Edwin C. Johnson from Colorado, the ranking member of the Senate <b>Military</b> Affairs <b>Committee.</b> The bill was known as the May-Johnson Bill for its sponsors. May immediately had the bill referred to the <b>Military</b> Affairs <b>Committee,</b> which held hearings on October 9. Bush, Conant and Groves all testified before the committee. But in the Senate <b>Military</b> Affairs <b>Committee,</b> {{the bill was}} held up by Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg.|$|R
50|$|The Central Organisation of <b>Military</b> Education <b>Committees</b> of the Universities and University Colleges was {{established}} in September 1919 following a conference of representatives of <b>Military</b> Education <b>Committees</b> of universities. The name was changed in 1970 to the Council of <b>Military</b> Education <b>Committees</b> of the Universities of the United Kingdom in order to express clearly {{the fact that it}} was not an organisation with an executive role but rather an advisory and coordinating body.|$|R
5|$|Each country's {{delegation}} {{includes a}} Military Representative, a senior officer from each country's armed forces, {{supported by the}} International Military Staff. Together the Military Representatives form the <b>Military</b> <b>Committee,</b> a body responsible for recommending to NATO's political authorities those measures considered necessary for the common defence of the NATO area. Its principal role is to provide direction and advice on military policy and strategy. It provides guidance on military matters to the NATO Strategic Commanders, whose representatives attend its meetings, and {{is responsible for the}} overall conduct of the military affairs of the Alliance under the authority of the Council. The Chairman of the NATO <b>Military</b> <b>Committee</b> is Petr Pavel of the Czech Republic, since 2015.|$|E
5|$|Like the Council, {{from time}} to time the <b>Military</b> <b>Committee</b> also meets at a higher level, namely at the level of Chiefs of Defence, the most senior {{military}} officer in each nation's armed forces. Until 2008 the <b>Military</b> <b>Committee</b> excluded France, due to that country's 1966 decision to remove itself from the NATO Military Command Structure, which it rejoined in 1995. Until France rejoined NATO, it was not represented on the Defence Planning Committee, and this led to conflicts between it and NATO members. Such {{was the case in the}} lead up to Operation Iraqi Freedom. The operational work of the Committee is supported by the International Military Staff.|$|E
5|$|The coup {{was planned}} by the <b>military</b> <b>committee,</b> {{rather than the}} Ba'ath Party's {{civilian}} leadership, but Michel Aflaq, {{the leader of the}} party, consented to the conspiracy. The leading members of the <b>military</b> <b>committee</b> throughout the planning process and {{in the immediate aftermath of}} taking power were Muhammad Umran, Salah Jadid and Hafez al-Assad. The committee enlisted the support of two Nasserists, Rashid al-Qutayni and Muhammad al-Sufi, and the independent Ziad al-Hariri. The coup was originally planned for 7 March, but was postponed one day after the government discovered where the conspirators were planning to assemble.|$|E

5|$|Umran {{was first}} given {{the command of}} the 5th Brigade in Homs, but was {{promoted}} in June to become commander of the 70th Armoured Brigade. As head of the Bureau of Officers' Affairs, Jadid appointed friends to senior positions, purged his enemies and appointed several Ba'athists to senior positions. Ahmad Suwaydani, {{one of the new}} members of the <b>Military</b> <b>Committee,</b> was appointed Head of Military Intelligence and Mazyad Hunaydi became Head of the Military Police. The Military Academy at Homs was put under Ba'athist control—several hundred Ba'athists, including Assad's brother Rifaat al-Assad, were given a crash course in military teaching before being given command. Assad became the de facto head of the Syrian Air Force, a dizzying promotion for a man in his thirties. Considering that the members of the <b>Military</b> <b>Committee</b> were all too young to be perceived as the real leaders of Syria by the populace, the <b>Military</b> <b>Committee</b> appointed Colonel Amin al-Hafiz to the post of Minister of the Interior.|$|E
5|$|At the beginning, {{there were}} no signs of the quarrels that would destroy the <b>military</b> <b>committee.</b> At the time, the members were bound {{together}} by their goal of building a prosperous nation. On 9 March the NCRC released Lu'ay al-Atassi from jail, promoted him to the rank of lieutenant general, appointed him commander-in-chief and NCRC chairman, the de facto head of state. Hariri was appointed chief of staff. While Atassi and Hariri held powerful posts, they did not possess enough personal or political power to threaten the NCRC. The Nasserist officers were also given notable offices with Muhammad al-Sufi becoming Minister of Defence and Rashid al-Qutayni becoming deputy chief of staff. However, the <b>Military</b> <b>Committee,</b> which had expanded its membership with five new members, ensured that the Ba'athists controlled the real levers of powers. The committee decided state policies before the sessions of the NCRC, and by doing so became the real seat of power.|$|E
5|$|For {{the coup}} to be successful, the <b>military</b> <b>committee</b> needed {{to gain the}} support {{of some of the}} Syrian officer corps. The {{collapse}} of the UAR, coupled with mutinies, purges and transfers left the officer corps in complete disarray and open to anti-government agitation. At the time, the officer corps was split into five different factions; the Damascus faction which supported the ancien régime, supporters of Akram al-Hawrani, a Nasserist faction, a Ba'athist faction and a group of independents. The Damascus faction was the enemy of the <b>military</b> <b>committee</b> because of their support for Nazim al-Kudsi's regime and the Hawranist were considered as rivals because of their stance against pan-Arabism. The Nasserists became allies of the Ba'ath, even while they supported Gamal Abdel Nasser and the reestablishment of the UAR.|$|E

5|$|In late May and June 1941, {{members of}} the Provincial Committee for Bosnia-Herzegovina {{travelled}} to the oblast (regional) centres of Banja Luka in the Bosanska Krajina region, Mostar in Herzegovina, and Tuzla in the Birač region of eastern Bosnia to advise the oblast KPJ committees of {{the decisions of the}} Central Committee, and to form oblast military committees. This also occurred in Sarajevo, for an oblast <b>military</b> <b>committee</b> responsible for the Romanija region of eastern Bosnia located north of that city. Each oblast <b>military</b> <b>committee</b> formed district military committees, who in turn contacted KPJ members in towns and villages of their district to organise resistance. This pyramid-like structure mirrored the KPJ structure, and following the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June, the Central Committee met on 4 July and decided to initiate an armed uprising against the occupiers. This included the creation of a formal military structure, headed by the General Staff for the People's Liberation Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito, who was also the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the KPJ.|$|E
5|$|The 1966 Syrian coup d'état {{refers to}} events between 21 and 23 February {{in which the}} {{government}} of the Syrian Arab Republic was overthrown and replaced. The ruling National Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party were removed from power by a union of the party's <b>Military</b> <b>Committee</b> and the Regional Command, under the leadership of Salah Jadid.|$|E
5|$|The Regional Congress of the Syrian Regional Branch, in March 1965, devolved {{power from}} the center, the National Command, to the Regional Command. From then on, the Regional Secretary of the Regional Command was {{considered}} Syria's ex officios head of state. The Regional Secretary {{had the power to}} appoint the Prime Minister, the cabinet, the chief of staff and top military commanders. Aflaq was unsettled by the way things were moving, and in May he convened the Eighth National Congress to get a showdown between his followers and those of the <b>Military</b> <b>Committee.</b> However, this never came to fruition. Several civilian members of the National Command, such as the Lebanese Jibran Majdalani and the Saudi Ali Ghannam, advised caution, believing that if he pressed the <b>Military</b> <b>Committee</b> too hard the military would take over the Syrian Regional Branch, and then the Ba'ath Party—as had happened in Iraq following the ousting of the Iraqi Regional Branch.|$|E

5|$|The power {{contest between}} the allied <b>Military</b> <b>Committee</b> and the Regionalists against the National Command was fought out {{within the party}} {{structure}}. However, the <b>Military</b> <b>Committee</b> and the Regionalists managed to turn the party structure on its head. At the 2nd Regional Congress (held in March 1965), {{it was decided to}} endorse the principle that the Regional Secretary of the Regional Command would be the ex officio head of state, and the Regional Command acquired the power to appoint the prime minister, the cabinet, the chief of staff, and the top military commanders. This change curtailed the powers of the National Command, who thenceforth had very little say in Syrian internal affairs. In response, at the 8th National Congress (April 1965) Aflaq had originally planned to launch an attack on the <b>Military</b> <b>Committee</b> and the Regionalists, but was persuaded not to by fellow National Command members – most notably by a Lebanese member, Jibran Majdalani, and a Saudi member, Ali Ghannam – because it could lead to the removal of the party's civilian leadership, as had occurred in the Iraqi Regional Branch. Because of this decision, Aflaq was voted from office as Secretary General, to be succeeded by fellow National Command member Munif al-Razzaz. Razzaz was a Syrian-born Jordanian who was not rooted enough in party politics to solve the crisis, even if under his command several joint meetings of the National and Regional Commands took place. Not longer after Aflaq's loss of office, Hafiz, the Secretary of the Regional Command, changed his allegiance to support the National Command. While Hafiz was the de jure leader of Syria (he held the offices of Regional Command secretary, Chairman of the Presidential Council, prime minister and commander-in-chief), it was Jadid, the Assistant Secretary General of the Regional Command, who was the de facto leader of Syria.|$|E
5|$|Following Habyarimana's death, a <b>military</b> <b>committee</b> led by Colonel Théoneste Bagosora took {{immediate}} {{control of}} the country. Under the committee's direction, the Hutu militia Interahamwe and the Presidential Guard began to kill Hutu and Tutsi opposition politicians and other prominent Tutsi figures; within 24 hours they had killed all moderate leaders, including Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana. The killers then began targeting the entire Tutsi population, as well as moderate Hutu, beginning the Rwandan Genocide. Over the course of approximately 100 days, over 1,000,000 Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well-planned attacks.|$|E

The Military Committee's stated goal was to reestablish a pan-Arab state; a goal Atrash shared. He was appointed Minister of Labor and Social Affairs in Salah al-Din al-Bitar's first government, and {{became a member of}} the Presidential Council, an organ responsible for running day-to-day state affairs. In February 1964 Atrash was elected to the 12-member Ba'ath Party National Command, which was nominally the highest policy-making body of the party.|$|E

5|$|However, between 28 April-2 May, the Ba'athist-dominated <b>Military</b> <b>Committee</b> {{virtually}} renounced {{the agreement}} when it purged over 50 Nasserist officers from their high-ranking {{positions in the}} armed forces, leading to a wide-scale propaganda campaign by Egypt via radio denouncing the Ba'ath (Nasserist-leaning newspapers had been previously shut down.) Mass pro-union rioting in Aleppo, Damascus, Hama {{and other parts of}} the country followed. The purges prompted the protest resignations of Nasserist officials, including Defense Minister al-Sufi, Deputy Chief of Staff al-Qutayni, and four other Nasserist cabinet members.|$|E
5|$|Jadid {{appointed}} Nureddin al-Atassi as President, Regional Secretary of the Regional Command and Secretary General of the National Command, Yusuf Zu'ayyin became Prime Minister again, and Ibrahim Makhus {{was appointed}} Minister of Foreign Affairs.

5|$|The Ba'ath Party {{captured}} 20 seats, {{down from}} 22, in the 1961 election. In 1962, after four years, Aflaq convened the Fifth Congress in Homs. Al-Hawrani was not invited; cells that had stayed active and defied Aflaq's orders, and Ba'athists who become Nasserists {{during the period}} of the UAR, were not invited to the congress. Aflaq was reelected the National Command's Secretary General, and ordered the reestablishment of the Syrian-regional Ba'ath organisation. During the congress, Aflaq and the <b>Military</b> <b>Committee,</b> through Muhammad Umran, made contact for the first time; the committee asked for permission to initiate a coup d'état; Aflaq supported the conspiracy. Following the success of the February 1963 Iraqi coup d'état, led by the Ba'ath Party's Iraqi Regional Branch, the <b>Military</b> <b>Committee</b> hastily convened to hatch a coup against Nazim al-Kudsi's presidency. The 8th of March Revolution, a military coup launched in 1963, proved successful, and a Ba'athist government in Syria was established. The plotters first order was to establish the National Council of the Revolutionary Command (NCRC), consisting entirely of Ba'athists and Nasserists, and controlled by military personnel rather than civilians from the very beginning.|$|E
