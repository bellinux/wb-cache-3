5|$|This is not {{the world}} of Ally McBeal. It is not about finding love remedially. This is {{a world in which}} too <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are asking what use is love if you find it too late. Yet somehow, {{probably}} because the moral judgments are lightly made, superannuated singletons such as myself can look on and see an advertisement for, rather than a warning against, that famously honourable estate—just as we do when we gaze at the more benign marriages of our friends. In Vanity Fair, Thackeray deliberately wrote a novel without a hero. We respond to Cold Feet because it, on the contrary, does not despise its characters.|$|E

25|$|In 1997 former Tikkun editors accused Lerner of {{publishing}} pseudonymous {{letters to the}} editor that he himself had written. While many of the letters were laudatory ("Your editorial stand on Iraq said publicly what <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> in the Israeli peace camp are feeling privately but dare not say."), a few were critical ("Have you gone off your rocker?"). Lerner admitted that he had written the letters but said his only mistake was not informing readers that the authors' names were pseudonyms.|$|E
25|$|For us {{the real}} {{revolution}} in critical theory...was heralded by the publication, in 1938, of Understanding Poetry...for <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who were preparing ourselves to teach English is those years....this book...came {{as a kind}} of revelation. It made sense because it opened up for us a way of talking about an actual poem in an actual classroom, and because the technique of focusing upon a poem as language rather than as history or biography or morality, gave a whole new meaning to and justification for the teaching of poetry (qtd. in Singh 1991).|$|E

25|$|The {{crisis in}} health and welfare {{services}} in our nation today highlights for NASW what <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have been stressing for a long time: inherent in the responsibility for leadership in social welfare is responsibility for professional action. They are not disparate aspects of social work but merely two faces {{of the same coin}} to be spent on more and better services for the people who need our help. It is out of our belief in this broad definition of responsibility for social welfare that NASW is taking leadership in the efforts to reorder our nation's priorities and future direction, and is calling on social workers everywhere to do the same.|$|E
25|$|The term heterophobia is {{confusing}} {{for some people}} for several reasons. On the one hand, some {{look at it as}} just another of the many me-too social constructions that have arisen in the pseudoscience of victimology in recent decades. (<b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> recall John Money’s 1995 criticism of the ascendancy of victimology and its negative impact on sexual science.) Others look at the parallelism between heterophobia and homophobia, and suggest that the former trivializes the latter... For others, it is merely a curiosity or parallel-construction word game. But for others still, it is part of both the recognition and politicization of heterosexuals' cultural interests in contrast to those of gays—particularly where those interests are perceived to clash.|$|E
25|$|In December 2013 in a blog {{article for}} The Spectator website {{published}} shortly after Nelson Mandela died, Rod Liddle wrote of BBC coverage: But for Christ's sake BBC, {{give it a}} bloody break for five minutes, will you? It's as if the poor bugger now has to bear your entire self-flagellating white post-colonial bien pensant guilt; look! Famous nice black man dies! Let's re-run {{the entire history of}} South Africa. That's better than watching the country we're in being flattened by a storm. He also wrote:Look; I'm sorry Nelson Mandela is dead. It happens quite often to people in their 90s who have been very ill, even famous people, but I'm sure that doesn't lessen the sadness for <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> I never met the man but, on balance, I {{came to the conclusion that}} he was a force for good rather than ill. I think I came to that rather banal and broad brush conclusion twenty years ago, or maybe fifteen. So, I'm sorry he's dead, I wish it were otherwise.|$|E

Chen alleged that his primary function at the consulate involved efforts to monitor and harass Falun Gong and to minimize support for the practice from Australian media and elected officials.

500|$|After a month's time, {{as early}} adopters started {{receiving}} their first monthly bills, stories of unusually large and expensive iPhone bills began to circulate. The 300-page bill was exceptional, but other heavy users received 50- to 100-page bills.

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Eric Goldman of IGN thought the episode [...] "wasn't {{as strong as}} the pilot" [...] and rated it at 7.4 ("Decent").

[...] Nonetheless, Goldman praised the episode's humorous scenes and the introduction of Dr. Conner's limb regeneration experiments.|$|E
