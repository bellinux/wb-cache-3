40|$|Systems {{containing}} {{a significant number}} of <b>Op</b> <b>Amps</b> can {{take a lot of time}} of simulation when <b>Op</b> <b>Amps</b> are described at the transistor level. For instance a 5 th order filter might involve 7 <b>Op</b> <b>Amps</b> and if each <b>Op</b> <b>Amps</b> contains say 12 to 15 transistors, the SPICE analysis of a circuit containing 60 to 75 Transistors can be too long and tricky in particular for time domain simulations. Therefore the use of a macromodel representing the <b>Op</b> <b>Amp</b> behavior reduces the simulation time and the complexity of the analysis. The simplicity of the analysis of <b>Op</b> <b>Amps</b> containing macromodels is because macromodels can be implemented using SPICE primitive components. Some examples of macromodels are discussed next...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{intelligently}} select the correct high speed <b>op</b> <b>amp</b> {{for a given}} application, {{an understanding of the}} various <b>op</b> <b>amp</b> topologies as well as the tradeoffs between them is required. The two most widely used topologies are voltage feedback (VFB) and current feedback (CFB). An overview of these topologies has been presented in previous tutorials (MT- 050, MT- 051, MT- 052), but the following discussion treats the frequency-related aspects of the two topologies in considerably more detail. HIGH SPEED VOLTAGE FEEDBACK (VFB) <b>OP</b> <b>AMP</b> TOPOLOGIES A voltage feedback (VFB) <b>op</b> <b>amp</b> is distinguished from a current feedback (CFB) <b>op</b> <b>amp</b> by circuit topology. The VFB <b>op</b> <b>amp</b> is certainly the most popular in low frequency applications, but the CFB <b>op</b> <b>amp</b> has some advantages at high frequencies. We will discuss high speed CFB in detail in Tutorial MT- 057, but first the more traditional VFB architecture. Early IC voltage feedback <b>op</b> <b>amps</b> were made on "all NPN " processes. These processes were optimized for NPN transistors—the "lateral " PNP transistors had relatively poor performance. Some examples of these early VFB <b>op</b> <b>amps</b> which used these poor quality PNPs include the 709, the LM 101 and the 741. Lateral PNPs were generally only used as current sources, level shifters, or for other non-critical functions. A simplified diagram of a typical VFB <b>op</b> <b>amp</b> manufactured on such a process is shown in Figure 1 below. v in...|$|R
40|$|In most {{applications}} of high speed <b>op</b> <b>amps,</b> {{it is the}} total output rms noise that is generally of interest. Because of the high bandwidths involved, the chief contributor to the output rms noise is therefore the white noise, and the 1 /f noise is negligible. Typical high speed <b>op</b> <b>amps</b> have bandwidths greater than 150 MHz or so, and bipolar voltage feedback (VFB) input stages have input voltage noises ranging from about 1 to 20 nV/√Hz. For a VFB <b>op</b> <b>amp,</b> the inverting and non-inverting input current noise are typically equal, and almost always uncorrelated. Typical values for wideband VFB <b>op</b> <b>amps</b> range from 0. 5 to 5 pA/√Hz. The input current noise of a bipolar input stage is increased when input bias-current compensation generators are added, because their current noise is not correlated, and therefore adds (in a root-sum-square manner) to the intrinsic current noise of the bipolar stage. However, bias current compensation is rarely used in high speed <b>op</b> <b>amps.</b> The input voltage noise in current feedback (CFB) <b>op</b> <b>amps</b> tends to be lower than for VFB <b>op</b> <b>amps</b> having the same approximate bandwidth. This is because the input stage in a CFB <b>op</b> <b>amp</b> is usually operated at a higher current, thereby reducing the emitter resistance and hence the voltage noise. Typical values for CFB <b>op</b> <b>amps</b> range from about 1 to 5 nV/√Hz...|$|R

40|$|Even though <b>op</b> <b>amps</b> and {{comparators}} {{may seem}} interchangeable {{at first glance}} there are some important differences. Comparators are designed to work open-loop, {{they are designed to}} drive logic from their outputs, and they are designed to work at high speed with minimal instability. <b>Op</b> <b>amps</b> are not designed for use as comparators, they may saturate if over-driven which may cause it to recover comparatively slowly. Many have input stages which behave in unexpected ways when used with large differential voltages, in fact, in many cases, the differential input voltage range of the <b>op</b> <b>amp</b> is limited. And <b>op</b> <b>amp</b> outputs are rarely compatible with logic. Yet many people still try to use <b>op</b> <b>amps</b> as comparators. While this may work at low speeds and low resolutions, many times the results are not satisfactory. Not all of the issues involved with using an <b>op</b> <b>amp</b> as a comparator can be resolved by reference to the <b>op</b> <b>amp</b> data sheet, since <b>op</b> <b>amps</b> are not intended for use as comparators. The most common issues are speed (as we have already mentioned), the effects of input structures (protection diodes, phase inversion in FET amplifiers, and many others), output structures which are not intended to drive logic, hysteresis and stability, and common-mode effects...|$|R

The second <b>Op</b> <b>Amp</b> is configured as a simple active high pass filter or a notch filter to attenuate 60Hz. The PCB circuit is usually designed with passive filtering capacitor/resistor networks due to space and cost.

40|$|<b>Op</b> <b>amps</b> {{have many}} applications. They {{are used in}} a wide variety of {{mathematical}} applications as a fundamental element of a mathematical circuit. Some more complicated models of an <b>op</b> <b>amp</b> have different properties such as input offset voltage, dc gain, bias current, input and output resistance. To account for these properties, more complicated models are required. This section will ignore practical and more advanced models and focus on the ideal operational amplifier. This module introduces the operational amplifier in a circuit. We will explore the purpose of an <b>op</b> <b>amp,</b> look at the characteristics and examine examples of it.

40|$|This {{tutorial}} {{discusses the}} noise generated within <b>op</b> <b>amps,</b> not the external noise {{which they may}} pick up due to magnetic and electric coupling. Minimizing this external noise is also important, but in this section we are concerned solely with <b>op</b> <b>amp</b> internal noise. There {{are a number of}} noise sources within an <b>op</b> <b>amp</b> (resistor noise, current noise, KT/C noise, etc.), but it is customary to model them externally as a voltage noise which appears differentially across the two inputs and two current noise sources, one in each input. These three noise sources are shown externally to the ideal "noiseless " <b>op</b> <b>amp.</b> The simple voltage noise <b>op</b> <b>amp</b> model is shown in Figure 1 below. The three noise sources are effectively uncorrelated (independent of each other). There is a slight correlation between the two noise currents, but it is too small to need consideration in practical noise analyses.

40|$|The {{need for}} high {{bandwidth}} operational amplifiers (<b>op</b> <b>amp)</b> exists for numerous applications. This need requires {{research in the}} area of <b>Op</b> <b>Amp</b> bandwidth extension. The exploited method in this thesis uses a class of compensation called Indirect Feedback Frequency Compensation in which the compensation current is fed back indirectly from the output to an internal high impedance node, to extend the bandwidth of an <b>Op</b> <b>Amp.</b> Among various compensation methods for operational amplifiers, indirect compensation offers potentially large benefits in regards to power to speed trade-off. The indirect compensated <b>Op</b> <b>Amps</b> can exhibit significant improvements in speed over traditional Miller compensated <b>Op</b> <b>Amps</b> and result in much smaller layout size and lower power consumption. However the technique has not been widely used in practice due to a lack of clear design procedure. This thesis develops an analytical description of how indirect compensation works and derives key trade off equations among various specifications. These results provide the insight needed for practically designing operational amplifiers with this technique. Based on the results, a step-by-step design procedure is proposed for an operational amplifier using indirect compensation. To demonstrate the proposed design procedure, a two stage <b>Op</b> <b>Amp</b> is designed. The <b>Op</b> <b>Amp</b> achieved a 2 MHz gain-bandwidth product (GBW) driving a large capacitive load (100 pF). The GBW of the <b>Op</b> <b>Amp</b> was improved by a factor of 10 times compared to the miller compensation scheme. The amplifier documented in this thesis achieved a higher simulated figures-of-merit (FoMs) compared to the state-of-art and can be directly used in integrated systems to achieve higher performance...|$|R
40|$|The gain-bandwidth (GB) {{product of}} an {{operational}} amplifier (<b>op</b> <b>amp)</b> can effect the filtering characteristics of an infinite gain, multiple feedback, low pass active RC filter.

Optimization theory is used to find adjusted values for the filter's elements to compensate for these GB effects. Of the sixty-five compensation design methods examined with the optimization program GOSPEL, twelve methods produced useful compensation results.

40|$|Some {{practical}} basic {{points are}} now considered regarding the allowable {{input and output}} voltage ranges of a real <b>op</b> <b>amp.</b> This obviously varies with not only the specific device, but also the supply voltage. While we can always optimize this performance point with device selection, more fundamental considerations come first. Any real <b>op</b> <b>amp</b> will have a finite voltage range of operation, at both input and output. In modern system designs, supply voltages are dropping rapidly, and 3 V to 5 V total supply voltages are now common for analog circuits such as <b>op</b> <b>amps.</b> This {{is a far cry}} from supply systems of the past, which were typically ± 15 V (30 V total). Because of these smaller voltages, it is very important to understand the limitations of both the input and the output voltage ranges—especially during the <b>op</b> <b>amp</b> selection process. OUTPUT COMMON-MODE VOLTAGE RANGE Figure 1 below is a general illustration of the limitations imposed by input and output dynamic ranges of an <b>op</b> <b>amp,</b> related to both supply rails.

40|$|<b>Op</b> <b>amp</b> {{oscillators}} are circuits {{that are}} unstable — {{not the type}} that are sometimes unin-tentionally designed or created in the lab — but circuits intentionally designed to remain in an unstable state. Oscillators are useful for creating uniform signals that are used as a reference in applications such as audio, function generators, digital systems, and com-munication systems. Two general classes of oscillators exist: sinusoidal and relaxation. Sinusoidal oscillators consist of amplifiers with RC or LC circuits that have adjustable oscillation frequencies, or crystals that have a fixed oscillation frequency. Relaxation oscillators generate triangu-lar, sawtooth, square, pulse, or exponential waveforms, {{and they are not}} discussed here. <b>Op</b> <b>amp</b> sine wave oscillators operate without an externally applied input signal. Some combination of positive and negative feedback is used to drive the <b>op</b> <b>amp</b> into an unsta-ble state, causing the output to transition back and forth at a continuous rate. The ampli-tude and the oscillation frequency are set by the arrangement of passive and active com-ponents around a central <b>op</b> <b>amp.</b> <b>Op</b> <b>amp</b> oscillators are restricted to {{the lower end of the}} frequency spectrum because <b>op</b> <b>amps</b> do not have the required bandwidth to achieve low phase shift at high frequencies. Voltage-feedback <b>op</b> <b>amps</b> are limited to a the low kHz range since their dominant, open loop pole may be as low as 10 Hz.
