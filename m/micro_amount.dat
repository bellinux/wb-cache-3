40|$|To date bulk {{amounts of}} commercially {{available}} energetic materials {{are used to}} train explosive sniffer dogs. The handling of these substances is strictly regulated due to legal reasons and their dangerous properties. The threat posed by extremely sensitive homemade explosives like TATP or HMTD made the development of safe training aids necessary. The use of bulk amounts of explosives can also cause uncontrollable contamination of the training area. A new type of training aid has been developed. The test bodies (EMPK® -Echtstoff Mikromengen Prüfkörper or <b>Micro</b> <b>amount</b> test devices) – entirely made of inorganic compounds - are mechanically impregnated {{with a small amount}} of real explosives. No solvents or other substances which might falsify the true odour of the explosive are used in this process. Many different types of compounds – solid, paste-like or liquid – can be incorporated. The EMPK® have been examined by German Institutes and are not considered to be explosives by law. They can therefore (within the EU) be sent by mail and stored in odourless glass containers instead of non-splintering cardboard or plastic containers. The training aids represent a strong local odour source. The rate of evaporation is reproducible and remains constant over a longer time period but is dependent on temperature and substance. This was proven by static μ-thermo-gravimetric measurements. Chromatographic measurements further indicate that softeners or residual monomers from plastics are not present in the gas phase. The explosive is only set free as vapour. Particles are not released...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{identify}} ostrich sex by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on <b>micro</b> <b>amounts</b> of DNA from blood, bloodstain and feathers. Sixteen male and 18 female ostriches were used as test individuals. Genomic DNA as a template was extracted by the Chelex method.

PCR products were checked using agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining and ostrich sex was determined directly by the bands shown on the gel. The results demonstrate that ostrich sex can be determined by the extraction of DNA from as little as 0. 0125 mu l blood using Chelex, whereby the use of large amounts of organic solvents such as phenol and chloroform are unnecessary. In addition, it is possible to identify ostrich sex using <b>micro</b> <b>amounts</b> of DNA extracted from bloodstains and/or feathers.

30|$|The lack of {{sensitivity}} {{associated with the}} need for detection of <b>micro</b> <b>amounts</b> of samples {{is probably one of the}} most frequently encountered problems in trace chemical analysis. As a whole, it was shown that TLS solved these problems, because in addition to the major advantage of thermal lens spectrometry (sensitivity), it gives the possibility to analyze a very low volume of the sample (15  µL); on the other hand, the volume of the remained phase after cloud point extraction is in the micro liter range. Therefore, TLS is suitable for analysis of the remained phase after the cloud point extraction, and this combination method (CPE-LI-TLS) exhibits high enhancement factor because of the preconcentration enhancement factor in CPE and the enhancement factor of TLS. In fact, the combined ultrasensitivity and small volume capability make it possible to be successfully used as powerful techniques for analytical devices. Moreover, in this work, by using an alkaline aqueous solution, the selectivity and sensitivity of the TLS method were improved.

Best results are obtained from electrolytic baths of approximately 2 M sulfuric acid, 0. 4 M ammonium sulfate, 0. 1 M sodium tartrate and 0. 06 M sodium nitrate.

The aim of {{this study}} is to compare two types of restoration for <b>micro</b> leakage <b>amount.</b> Subjects and Methods: Thirty four premolars were randomly divided in two groups. In the direct composite restorations, mesio-occlusal cavities were prepared. After etching and bondig the cavity, 1 mm of the floor of the box was filled with F 2 composite and the rest of it was restored with Nulite F. In the direct inlay composite group, cavities with same dimensions but with divergent walls (5 - 6 degrees) were prepared. Then Tetric Ceram composite was directly formed and cured in the cavity. Inlays were taken out and heated in boiling water for seven minutes. Then sandblasting by aluminum oxide was performed and inlays were cemented in the cavities with Rely X cement. Then the specimens were thermo cycled and immersed in 2 % fushin for 24 hours. Samples were investigated with stereomicroscope with magnification ratio of 40 and analysis was done with Mann-Whitney test. Results: All the samples in to the two groups are in score 0 and score 1 division based on their microleakage (without microleakage: score 0, microleakage to enamel: score 1). The data analysis showed that the two groups had not significant statistical difference. Discussion: Although in direct inlay restorations most of polymerization shrinkage occurs extra oral, but it is not sufficient for complete reduction in <b>micro</b> leakage <b>amount</b> but this restoration is clinically suitable as direct composite restoration.

40|$|Traditional {{models of}} {{electronic}} money, usually used for electronic payment {{systems are not}} adap- ted for small amounts of high-volume transactions. When the product is very low value, such as music, art, transport tickets, traditional schemes are far from ideal. Payments must be made very quickly, wi- thout requiring significant system resources. As we know the system resources cost money, and some low-value goods would become cheaper than the transaction costs. In this work i present the electronic money model based on the conceptual WebCoin electronic payment scheme. Model is extended by using a fully hierarchical proxy signature, Schnorr signature scheme and some small changes in the WebCoin scheme. Closed circuit of bank, customers and vendors is extended to fully hierarchical tree of banks. Blind signature from fully hieararchical electronic signature scheme is substituted with a classic Shnorr electronic signature scheme. Instead of two denominations of coins used by the WebCoin scheme, I introduce an additional denomination. In this way, I improve a system of <b>micro</b> <b>amounts</b> to medium-sized payments. Medium amount payments in this work are such that the transaction amount does not exceed 100 LTL, but other interpretations are possible. The system is prepared {{to be used with}} unlimited amounts, but in offline mode it is more difficult to prevent duplication or counterfeiting of money. Medium amount payments are simply not worth the risk. Analytical part of this work introduces different electronic money schemes and types of signatures, and review their properties. Methodological section presents models and schemes that are used in this work. It also will present theorems showing properties of schemes. Research part will describe the creation of functioning model and code of the package in which the model is realized...|$|R
