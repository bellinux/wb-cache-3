40|$|Energy efficiency, {{in modern}} buildings, is {{increasingly}} taken in to account, {{while maintaining the}} comfort of visitors. Because of technology evolution interconnection between systems becomes simpler. Combining different technologies into a single system, the system becomes more flexible, more functional and have fewer elements. Modern building management systems include the growing diversity of the buildings, so as to ensure a growing urban energy efficiency. People working in the office, {{spend most of the}} day there, so efficient and comfortable <b>management</b> <b>of</b> these <b>premises</b> is very relevant. Lighting, ventilation, and refrigeration equipment are controlled, in order to maintain energy efficiency and comfort. Energy efficient and comfort guarantees algorithms was created who were used in programmable logic controllers, functionally complemented by KNX system elements. This system made it possible to establish custom adapted algorithms using KNX system provided information on office space availability. From an overall system profound study found that using this kind system, about 50 % of the electricity can be saved for office lighting, ventilation and air conditioning systems work. Such system has not only energy efficiency, but also helps to save on system installation as for efficient ventilation and air conditioning systems work not need to install additional equipment. Thus, such a building management system becomes a great option for effectively manage modern buildings...|$|R

Therefore, the object of this research is represented by the question of the relationship between performance and excellence at the organizational level. Under these conditions, assuming such options aims, on the one hand, an economic analysis of what the mission of an organization represents, and on the other hand, an investigation focused on the identification and the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> the <b>premises</b> underlying its definition and enunciation. From the methodological point of view, this research is organized in an explanatory approach whose aim consists in analyzing the performance and the business excellence within the organization. In this regard, as a result of some significant changes at the society level, we support the idea that the analysis of the business organization's mission should be linked to a pragmatic approach which implies an efficient management strategy. The present interest and the importance of this approach express the fact that economically, but also socially, an important role in explaining the business organization's mission is represented by the contextual pattern. Thus, the comprehension of typology and the establishment <b>of</b> some well-founded <b>management</b> strategies (at the organization level and at the business level) represent evaluation criteria and performance analysis in business administration. Therefore, the particular meanings of a social reality generate specific attitudes for managers to assume the business organization's mission...|$|R

30|$|While {{the zones}} {{described}} above {{are presented as}} fixed spatial entities, the highly dynamic nature of WNR suggests a role for temporal as well as spatial zonation. Ecosystem management that allows for different management strategies to be expressed temporally helps achieve clearly enunciated conservation targets. As we have described the overall target for WNR – conservation and maintenance of migratory wetland bird populations - is seasonal in nature. Learning from nature and seizing the “right” time to maximise conservation is essential to developing an efficient management system. Accordingly, we suggest a system of dynamic zoning {{on an annual basis}} would further improve the effectiveness <b>of</b> WNR <b>management.</b> The <b>premise</b> <b>of</b> such dynamic zoning assumes a deep understanding of ecological processes at spatial and temporal scales, which we believe exists for WNR.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the gathering, interpretation {{and use of}} information pertaining to work-related violence as a risk {{to the health and}} safety of staff. It considers incident reporting systems in particular, and describes work carried out to extend the usefulness of such a system operating within the licensed retail trade. Information obtained from the system falls into two categories. First, information about the reporting system itself includes the benefits and limitations of incident reporting as a diagnostic tool for the occurrence of violence, and the use of complementary methods to enhance its effectiveness; the design of a report form that elicits more detail than is required by national reporting; the evolution of a flexible and easily expandable coding scheme; and the usefulness of innovative pathway and survival techniques in the treatment of the violent incident as a developing situation. Second, information about violent incidents within licensed <b>premises</b> concerns characteristics <b>of</b> reported incidents; the dynamic nature of incidents; common pathways through violent incidents; the relation of the outcomes of incidents to other features; the timing of incidents; and the perceived seriousness of the reported incidents. Key findings include the role of every-day situations and ordinary objects used as weapons; the pivotal importance of intervention by staff, particularly in challenging customer misbehaviour; a system memory effect that increases the likelihood of a further incident occurring during the days and weeks following a reported incident at the same premises; and the variety of features that contribute to the seriousness rating given to an incident by the members of staff involved. The methods and findings have implications for academic research, for the organisational <b>management</b> <b>of</b> work-related violence and for the day-to-day <b>management</b> <b>of</b> licensed <b>premises.</b> Primarily, they can be used in devising strategies to reduce the risks to staff...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Enterprises {{compete in}} high dynamic and fast {{changing}} markets. Reacting quickly and flexibly to market changes {{is a crucial}} competitive advantage for an enterprise. Therefor <b>premises</b> <b>of</b> strategic planning and achievement of strategic goals have to be controlled permanently and in a systematic way. Strategic control which is part <b>of</b> strategic <b>management</b> monitors <b>premises</b> <b>of</b> the corporate strategy and {{the environment of the}} enterprise in order to evaluate whether the strategic positioning is still appropriate or whether the strategy has to be adopted due to changes in constraints. This paper shows how the enterprise architecture of an enterprise can be used as an instrument of strategic control. Strategic control is characterized by a high demand on information. Hence one needs to know where needed information is to gather. Enterprise architecture which is enriched by results and information <b>of</b> strategic <b>management</b> process is a helpful instrument in delivering information respectively the source of gathering information used in strategic control. In particular for each enterprise architecture layer a proposal is given how strategic control can be supported. ...|$|R

Decentralisation, {{has led to}} devolving responsibilities to local authorities, bringing along more independence for the schools {{and at the same}} time an increase in the number of decision makers with a new set of agendas, criteria, concerns and priorities. School buildings on the other hand are prone to post-occupancy design and alteration. In addition to post-occupancy design decisions, many other operational and maintenance decisions need to be made on a day-to-day basis to ensure that all activities within a premise will be carried out flawlessly. An ongoing research project focuses on post-occupancy design issues in schools in the UK. The research investigates the key factors in post-occupancy performance, in close collaboration with key stakeholders in school projects. It also outlines the maintenance and <b>management</b> <b>of</b> those <b>premises</b> and maps out the flow of information and the exchange of knowledge in this process. Using those findings it will then propose a decision support system to assist schools as well as local authorities in their post-occupancy design decisions. This paper establishes the decision processes and investigates the relationships between the stakeholders and how those may have impacts on the decision processes. The main focus of this paper however, is on the collaborative work processes for all the stakeholders to co-create knowledge and value. Once established it will then be used to devise a decision support system which will act as a permanent hub to facilitate information flow and knowledge exchange for post-occupancy works in school buildings. The paper will conclude with the design criteria for such a platform...|$|R

Lamentably the rate <b>of</b> chicken slaughter <b>premises</b> which got halal accreditation from the Jabatan Kemajuan Islam Malaysia (JAKIM) and the Jabatan Agama Islam Negeri (JAIN) is low. This {{study was conducted to}} identify the application of the halal slaughtering concept as indicated by Islamic Law, taking into account four fundamental variables which poultry slaughterhouse managements, works procedures in slaughterhouses, the poultry slaughter process and poultry slaughtering equipment. This study was conducted in the Pontian area, with the number of respondents that was 19 among poultry slaughterhouse managers. A questionnaire was utilized as the research instrument.

International productivity differences have more often been examined by bringing managers from the relatively weak performer (i. e. the UK) to factories in best-practice economies but the novelty in this study was to supplement visits to Germany by bringing a senior German manager into factories in the low productivity area. He examined the following characteristics: markets served; comparative physical productivity; product quality; machine type and appropriateness, attitudes and skills of the shop-floor labour force; quality <b>of</b> <b>management</b> and <b>premises.</b> The Northern Ireland managers made a return visit to four German factories and assessed those companies on the same criteria.
