25|$|Artificial fog is {{man-made}} fog that {{is usually}} created by vaporizing a water- and glycol-based or glycerine-based fluid. The fluid is injected into a heated <b>metal</b> <b>block,</b> and evaporates quickly. The resulting pressure forces the vapor out of a vent. Upon coming into contact with cool outside air, the vapor condenses in microscopic droplets and appears as fog. Such fog machines are primarily used for entertainment applications.|$|E
25|$|Block printing, called tarsh in Arabic, {{developed}} in Arabic Egypt during the ninth and tenth centuries, mostly for prayers and amulets. There {{is some evidence}} to suggest that these print blocks made from non-wood materials, possibly tin, lead, or clay. The techniques employed are uncertain, however, and they appear to have had very little influence outside of the Muslim world. Though Europe adopted woodblock printing from the Muslim world, initially for fabric, the technique of <b>metal</b> <b>block</b> printing remained unknown in Europe. Block printing later went out of use in Islamic Central Asia after movable type printing was introduced from China.|$|E
2500|$|Mechanically, {{the cavity}} {{magnetron}} {{consists of a}} large, solid cylinder of metal with a hole drilled {{through the center of}} the circular face. A wire acting as the cathode is run down the center of this hole, and the <b>metal</b> <b>block</b> itself forms the anode. Around this hole, known as the [...] "interaction space", are a number of similar holes ("resonators") drilled parallel to the interaction space, separated only a very short distance away. A small slot is cut between the interaction space and each of these resonators. The resulting block looks something like the cylinder on a revolver, with a somewhat larger central hole. (Early models were actually cut using Colt pistol jigs.) The parallel sides of the slots act as a capacitor while the anode block itself provides an inductor analog. Thus, each cavity forms its own resonant circuit, the frequency of which is defined by the energy of the electrons and the physical dimensions of the cavity.|$|E

50|$|Through {{this process}} of TDTR, the thermal {{properties}} of many materials can be obtained. Common test setups include having multiple <b>metal</b> <b>blocks</b> connected together in a diffusion multiple, where once subjected to high temperatures various compounds can be created {{as a result of}} the diffusion of two adjacent <b>metal</b> <b>blocks.</b> An example would be a Ni-Cr-Pd-Pt-Rh-Ru diffusion multiple which would have diffusion zones of Ni-Cr, Ni-Pd, Ni-Pt and so on. In this way, many different materials can be tested at the same time. Lowest thermal conductivity for a thin film of solid, fully dense material (i.e. not porous) was also recently reported with measurements using this method.|$|R
40|$|According to {{the survey}} on block-printed batik {{production}} using <b>metal</b> <b>blocks</b> in Thailand’s three southernmost provinces – Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat, only batik factories in Narathiwat were found using such method. Since the blocks were made of metal, their parts were damaged by getting bent, twisted or hit by one another when stored. Additionally, the metal parts would come off the plates {{because they were not}} properly welded. According to Mr. Ya Bindorlao, a <b>metal</b> block-maker, batik <b>block</b> production and repair required meticulous skills and expertise. In addition, some blocks were repairable while others were discarded due to high repair cost although some parts were still functional. Batik makers, therefore, tended to use the same blocks repeatedly, limiting innovative patterns in the market. The objectives of this study were as follows: 1) To collect and examine batik motifs on <b>metal</b> <b>blocks</b> in the three southernmost provinces of Thailand. 2) To develop modular batik blocks, whose parts can be removable and adjustable in order to create more patterns The study shows that the motifs found on the <b>metal</b> <b>blocks</b> can be classified into six categories: 1) a flora motif, 2) a geometric motif, 3) a fauna motif, 4) an object motif, 5) ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe goods made of light-gage <b>metal</b> <b>blocks</b> {{providing}} for threaded attachment of different components have currently been {{widely used in}} mechanical engineering. The problem of ensuring strength of such connections consists in achieving a sufficient screwing length {{providing for}} three-five thread turns. Such methods as plate bending, welding of nuts, molding of plugs and deformation of <b>metal</b> <b>blocks</b> in closed press tools are applied to increase the screwing length. All these methods are insufficiently advanced and require application of additional equipment and consumables. This problem can be solved by forming tap holes by thermal drilling, when the material of the hole is not removed with chips but used for flanging, thus, ensuring sufficient screwing length. This article considers the mechanism of flanging formation by the rotating punch, interconnection between geometrical dimensions of flanging and process simulation by means of ANSYS software package...|$|R

50|$|The letterpress, perfected {{in the mid}} {{fifteenth century}} by Johannes Gutenberg (1398-1468) through the {{combined}} use of the printing press, oil-based inks, and cast metal type, remained {{the most common and}} efficient method of printing until the 1960s. Used frequently with typography design and type layout, the letterpress operates through the stamping of type and photo-engraved <b>metal</b> <b>blocks</b> on paper. The <b>metal</b> <b>blocks</b> are arranged in a frame by the printer, and the text columns and etchings are separated by vertical or horizontal metal bars; it is even possible to arrange the blocks at an angle using a letterpress. With the letterpress, print design and graphics remained black and white print on paper until the late nineteenth century. The letterpress was the first technology that allowed for mass production and distribution of printed material at a large scale, and because of this, quickly replaced the slow processes of woodblock printing and hand copying of print design.|$|R
