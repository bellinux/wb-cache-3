5|$|The {{idea was}} first {{discussed}} in 2000. To make the game {{feel like a}} film, Revolution brought in a cinematic consultant, Bob Keen, who <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> game conveyed emotions and atmosphere appropriate for each scene. The game was originally planned to have similar cartoon-quality visuals as its prequels, but the developers decided to aim at a style similar to Japanese animated films. Unlike the first two Broken Sword games, which used the Virtual Theatre engine, The Sleeping Dragon was built with the RenderWare engine. The game's music was composed by Ben McCullough, and Rolf Saxon returned to voice George Stobbart.|$|E
5|$|Islanders {{struggled}} with food shortage {{in the last}} months of the occupation. Hathaway organised a raid on German grain stocks and saved many families from starvation with her secret potato hoard. Sark was liberated on 10 May 1945. Three British officers arrived and, explaining that no British troops were available, asked the Dame to take command of 275 men belonging to the defeated German garrison. She <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> garrison cleared up the island of land mines. She was, however, so concerned about the legal status of the decisions she had issued during the war that she sailed to Guernsey to validate them as soon as the island was liberated. Her experience of the German occupation inspired William Douglas-Home's play The Dame of Sark. Hathaway's manner of receiving Germans has been described as both impressive and overly cordial.|$|E
5|$|New York {{was unable}} to build on their 1970 success. Tarkenton left the team's 1971 {{training}} camp in a salary dispute, before coming back {{a few days later}} after signing a one-year contract. In place of a salary increase, Tarkenton had asked for a large loan to get a tax break, but the Maras turned it down, and <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> press knew the raise and loan were denied. Johnson missed most of the season with a knee injury, and the Giants dropped to 4–10. Before the 1972 season they traded Tarkenton, who frequently feuded with Webster, back to the Vikings. Initially the trade produced positive results, as New York rallied to finish 8–6 in 1972. The 1972 team was led by veteran journeyman quarterback Norm Snead (acquired in the trade for Tarkenton), who led the league in passing and had the best season of his career. They set a still-standing team record on November 26 when they scored 62 points via eight touchdowns and two field goals. After the 1972 season however, the Giants suffered one of the worst prolonged stretches in their history. Meanwhile, Tarkenton would lead the Vikings to three Super Bowls and establish a Hall of Fame resume.|$|E

5|$|When first {{introducing}} Sasuke, Kishimoto {{wrote him}} as a rival who never noticed Naruto. However, as the series continued, Naruto became strong enough to be recognized by Sasuke as a rival. He also intended both as brothers {{due to the fact}} both characters suffered loneliness, something which made the readers relate to them as he noted through fan latters. By Part I's ending, the bond between Naruto and Sasuke was weakened {{as a result of their}} fight but still expected the time when the Sasuke accepted Naruto as an equal. Kishimoto drastically changed Sasuke's character, and the plot, by making him one of the series' antagonists, comparing Sasuke and Naruto to the concept of yin and yang because of their notable differences. When one of the two progressed, Kishimoto <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> other did too. Before the serialization began, Kishimoto had decided the ending would feature a fight between these two characters. He wanted the conflict to end with Naruto forgiving Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato. By 2013 when the series was reaching its climax, Kishimoto told the readers to look forward the final fight between the two characters. In regards to the fight, Kishimoto wanted to focus on hand-to-hand combat rather than ninja techniques. Anime staff Chengxi Huang said the animated adaptation of this fight, the group worked carefully to depict the action in every scene by showing changes on Sasuke and Naruto's clothes and hair. Huang added he felt fatigue by working so much into this fight due to reaching 70 successive cuts at a time.|$|E

The presence of politicians was very heavy indeed– the festival was opened by Vojvodina provincial assembly president Nenad Čanak and Novi Sad mayor Borislav Novaković. Furthermore, Minister of Finance Božidar Đelić and the National Bank governor Mlađan Dinkić performed a set of EKV covers before a raucous crowd.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, {{while visiting}} Brazil, Dunham and her group were refused rooms at a {{first-class}} hotel in São Paulo, the Hotel Esplanada, frequented by many American businessmen. Understanding {{that the fact}} was due to racial discrimination, she <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> incident was publicized. The incident was widely discussed in the Brazilian press and became a hot political issue. In response, the Afonso Arinos law was passed in 1951 that made racial discrimination in public places a felony in Brazil.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, the perp walks {{dates back}} more than a century, to when cameras' shutter speed became fast enough to allow {{photography}} {{of a small group}} of individuals walking. It is believed to have been done even prior to Theodore Roosevelt's tenure as New York City police commissioner in the 1890s. The city's newspaper photographers soon ritualized it. J.

25|$|Maurice led {{the army}} into the {{captured}} city {{and then set}} about repairing and strengthening the defenses. The city was then garrisoned by the Scottish troops that {{took part in the}} siege; they remained there until the Autumn of the same year. After the success at Geertruidenberg the Frisian troops urged the States-General to bring the army to Groningen. However, because there was a truce in France at this time, Mansfeld {{in the eyes of the}} Dutch, could have threatened the Republic with his large army. Maurice as a result <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> army kept a watch on the Spanish troops threatening the south of the Republic.|$|E
25|$|Federal marshals {{are most}} {{famous for their}} law {{enforcement}} work, {{but that was only}} a minor part of their workload. The largest part of the business was paper work—serving writs (e.g., subpoenas, summonses, warrants), and other processes issued by the courts, making arrests and handling all federal prisoners. They also disbursed funds as ordered by the courts. Marshals paid the fees and expenses of the court clerks, U.S. Attorneys, jurors, and witnesses. They rented the courtrooms and jail space, and hired the bailiffs, criers, and janitors. They <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> prisoners were present, the jurors were available, and that the witnesses were on time.|$|E

25|$|The {{contract}} for the aircraft to Air Ministry specification C.16/46 was signed on 9 March 1946 and Vickers allocated the designation Type 609 and the name Viceroy. Although George Edwards had always favoured the 800hp Rolls-Royce Dart other engines were considered, including the Armstrong Siddeley Mamba which the government specified for the two prototypes. The choice of the Mamba engine increased the weight but Vickers <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> engine nacelle would fit either the Mamba or Dart. While the Dart progressed better in development, the government asked in August 1947 for the second prototype to be Dart-powered. The second prototype was designated the 630 and was named as the Viscount. The first prototype already under construction was converted to the Dart as a 630 as well.|$|E
25|$|Kupcinet {{apparently}} {{went straight}} home after dining with her friends. She was visited by freelance writer Edward Stephen Rubin shortly afterward. The two were then joined by actor Robert Hathaway around 9:30 pm. They told detectives they watched TV, including The Danny Kaye Show, with Kupcinet. They all drank coffee until she fell asleep, {{sitting next to}} them on the couch. She awoke and went to her room. The men either turned the TV set off or simply lowered the volume (three days later it was still playing with a low volume), and <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> door was locked behind them before departing at about 11:15 pm. Hathaway said Rubin and he returned to his place and were later joined by Kupcinet's boyfriend, Andrew Prine, who was also Hathaway's neighbor. The three young men watched television and talked until around 3:00 am.|$|E
25|$|Bruce Gradkowski's {{homecoming}} {{was also}} his worst {{game of the}} season. In the first quarter, Ben Roethlisberger threw his only interception {{early in the game}} to linebacker Derrick Brooks. Later in the quarter, Gradkowski tossed his first interception to Steeler linebacker Larry Foote. In the final seconds of the first quarter, Roethlisberger threw a short touchdown pass to tight end Jerame Tuman. Later in the first half, Gradkowski tossed another interception in the red zone to Bryant McFadden. Steeler kicker Jeff Reed, kicked a fifty-yard field goal to end the first half. After another interception of Gradkowski in the second half, Roethlisberger completed a touchdown pass in the early fourth quarter. By the two-minute warning, the score was 20–0, in the favor of the Steelers. Tampa Bay kicker Matt Bryant, <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> Bucs did not get shut out with a 27-yard field goal in the last seconds of regulation.|$|E

25|$|The {{victory at}} Amiens was celebrated {{as a huge}} victory; {{not only did it}} mark a {{definitive}} turn in the road to Franco-Spanish peace but Spain had to sacrifice the war against France. In conjunction with Spanish financial distress, her insolvency caused by her bankrupt nature after the Capture of Cadiz, two costly failed armadas (in 1596 and 1597) against England and the war against the Dutch meant that Spain had too much too deal with. Mutinies in the garrisons of Doulens, Cambrai, Ardres and Le Catalet added to Spain's problems. With this advantage Henry <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> Peace of Vervins was signed which would end the war between Spain and France. The treaty was highly beneficial to France - an ill and dying Philip recognized the formerly Protestant Henry as King of France. In addition Spanish ruled towns were handed over to the French king under terms of the peace. Vervins was the final defeat of Philip II, and a sign of the long downfall of Habsburg Spain and the gradual rise in European hegemony of France during the ensuing Grand Siècle.|$|E

While Fisher had ordered the deposits retrieved and <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> tickets weren't used, he didn't tell anyone in the athletic or compliance offices, as he was required to do.

500|$|Steve Albini, nicknamed the"Godfather of grunge", {{was another}} {{important}} {{influence on the}} grunge sound. Albini prefers {{to be called a}} [...] "recording engineer", because he believes that putting record producers in charge of recording sessions often destroys the band's real sound, while the role of the recording engineer is to capture the actual sound of the musicians, not to threaten the artists' control over their creative product. Albini's recordings have been analyzed by writers such as Michael Azerrad, who stated that Albini's [...] "recordings were both very basic and very exacting: like Endino, Albini used few special effects; got an aggressive, often violent guitar sound; and <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> rhythm section slammed as one." ...|$|E
500|$|Charles Cecil was the {{director}} of the game, and Tony Warriner was responsible for AI programming and some aspects of the game's design. To make the game feel like a film, Revolution brought in a cinematic consultant, Bob Keen, who <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> game conveyed emotions and atmosphere appropriate for each scene. The music in the game was composed by Ben McCullough. The voice recording was scheduled to take five days; however, the entire process took four days. The voices were recorded with the voice actors together, enabling better acting and interaction. The full script is 6,000 lines in total, similar to Broken Sword II. While Rolf Saxon returned to voice George Stobbart, Nicole [...] "Nico" [...] Collard was played by Sarah Crook.|$|E

The results were notable as the [...] "Million Dollar Quartet" [...] recordings—Johnny Cash was long thought to have played as well, but he was present only briefly at Phillips's instigation for a photo opportunity. The year ended with a front-page story in The Wall Street Journal reporting that Presley merchandise had brought in $22 million on top of his record sales, and Billboards declaration that he had placed more songs in the top 100 than any other artist since records were first charted. In his first full year at RCA, one of the music industry's largest companies, Presley had accounted for over 50 percent of the label's singles sales.|$|E
