40|$|Objective: The {{differential}} diagnosis of <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesotheliomas</b> and lung adenocarcinomas is problematic for pathologists especially in small biopsy materials. In this study, we aimed {{to investigate whether}} the immunohistochemically determined Claudin 3 and Claudin 4 immunoreactivities are useful in the {{differential diagnosis}} between <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesotheliomas</b> and lung adenocarcinomas. Material and Method: Using the epitope-specific rabbit antibody Claudin 3 and Claudin 4, 32 cases of <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesothelioma</b> (25 epithelioid, 7 biphasic) and 14 cases of lung adenocarcinoma were studied immunohistochemicallyResults: None of the cases of <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesotheliomas</b> expressed Claudin 4, whereas all lung carcinomas were immunopositive. Claudin 3 expression was immunonegative in 29 (90. 6 %) cases and immunopositive in 3 (9. 3 %) cases of <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesothelioma.</b> With Claudin 3, 11 / 14 (78. 9 %) lung adenocarcinomas and 3 / 32 (9. 4 %) <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesotheliomas</b> were immunopositive (p= 0. 000).

40|$|Abstract Background Diffuse <b>malignant</b> peritoneal <b>mesothelioma</b> and ocular {{melanoma}} {{are both}} rare tumors. To {{the best of}} our knowledge there is only one previous report of three cases in a family with known susceptibility to malignancies associating diffuse <b>malignant</b> peritoneal <b>mesothelioma</b> and ocular melanoma, with no sporadic cases previously reported. Case presentation We describe the case of a 59 -year-old man with a history of diffuse <b>malignant</b> peritoneal <b>mesothelioma,</b> who presented with ocular melanoma 41 months after cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. We also briefly review the literature. Conclusions Diffuse <b>malignant</b> peritoneal <b>mesothelioma</b> is an uncommon but aggressive disease. As diffuse <b>malignant</b> peritoneal <b>mesothelioma</b> characteristically remains confined to the abdominal cavity, any new extra-abdominal symptom should eventually raise suspicion of another primary tumor. Few cases of diffuse <b>malignant</b> peritoneal <b>mesothelioma</b> associated with other primary tumors have been reported. As ocular melanoma is also infrequent, we suspect a genetic predisposition to these tumors. There is emerging evidence supporting the role of BAP 1 mutations in the pathogenesis of these two neoplasias. </p...|$|R

In all mesotheliomas but one the integrated optical density was greater than in reactive mesothelial hyperplasia.

We examined a series of 13 diffuse <b>malignant</b> <b>mesotheliomas</b> and four mesothelial cell rich effusion samples of non-neoplastic aetiology from non-immunodepressed patients using the polymerase chain reaction to detect HHV- 8 specific sequences.

40|$|ObjectiveAlthough platinum-based {{chemotherapy}} {{is widely}} used in <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesothelioma,</b> its modest therapeutic effect warrants identification of enhancing agents. As with many cancers, the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase/Akt pathway is often activated in <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesothelioma</b> and has been implicated in the tumor's aggressiveness. Sirolimus is a well-established inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin. We sought to determine whether combination treatment with sirolimus and cisplatin would enhance cell death in <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesothelioma.</b> MethodsHuman <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesothelioma</b> cell lines were incubated with sirolimus or cisplatin alone or in combination and assayed for cell viability. To characterize phosphorylation status after treatment, Akt and downstream proteins of mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, p 70 S 6 kinase and 4 E-BP 1, were analyzed by Western blot. Effect of combination treatment was also analyzed with extreme drug resistance assay in 12 human <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesothelioma</b> tumors with varying resistance to cisplatin. ResultsIndividual <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesothelioma</b> cell lines exhibited a range of sensitivities to each drug without correlation with subtype. Sirolimus and cisplatin significantly (P =. 029) increased cell death versus either drug alone in 4 cell lines. Combined treatment caused dephosphorylation of Akt, 4 E-BP 1, and p 70 S 6 kinase. Cell proliferation was significantly decreased in tumors subjected to sirolimus and cisplatin versus cisplatin or sirolimus alone. ConclusionsSirolimus appears to enhance the cytotoxicity of cisplatin in <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesothelioma</b> cell lines through the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway.

40|$|Introduction. We {{investigated}} {{the expression of}} microRNAs and mRNAs in pleural tissues from patients with either <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesothelioma</b> or benign asbestos-related pleural effusion. Methods. Fresh frozen tissues from a total of 18 <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesothelioma</b> and 6 benign asbestos-related pleural effusion patients were studied. Expression profiling of mRNA and microRNA was performed using standard protocols. Results. We discovered significant upregulation of multiple microRNAs in <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesothelioma</b> compared to benign asbestos-related pleural effusion. Hsa-miR- 484, hsa-miR- 320, hsa-let- 7 a, and hsa-miR- 125 a- 5 p were able to discriminate malignant from benign disease. Dynamically regulated mRNAs were also identified. MET was the most highly overexpressed gene in <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesothelioma</b> compared to benign asbestos-related pleural effusion. Integrated analyses examining microRNA-mRNA interactions suggested multiple altered targets within the Notch signaling pathway. Conclusions. Specific microRNAs and mRNAs may have diagnostic utility in differentiating patients with <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesothelioma</b> from benign asbestos-related pleural effusion.

40|$|ObjectiveIntegrin-linked kinase, {{which is}} {{relevant}} to neoplastic transformation, is highly expressed in <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesothelioma.</b> Recently, detection of integrin-linked kinase in serum of patients with ovarian cancer has been reported. This study asks whether integrin-linked kinase can also be detected in serum of patients with <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesothelioma</b> and whether serum level has diagnostic or prognostic relevance for that disease. MethodsA sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was designed to detect integrin-linked kinase and applied to serum samples from 46 patients with <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesothelioma,</b> 98 patients with other malignant chest disease, and 23 patients with benign chest disease. Integrin-linked kinase serum concentration and clinical data were correlated statistically. ResultsMedian serum integrin-linked kinase concentration was significantly higher in <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesothelioma</b> (8. 89 ng/mL) than in other malignant chest disease (0. 66 ng/mL) or benign chest disease (0. 78 ng/mL, P < . 001). There was no relevant correlation of serum integrin-linked kinase with cell lysis parameters (R 2  <  0. 1). Serum integrin-linked kinase concentration greater than 2. 48 ng/mL had diagnostic sensitivity of 80 %, specificity of 95 %, positive predictive value of 85. 7 %, negative predictive value of 92. 7 %, and overall accuracy of 91 % for distinction between <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesothelioma</b> and other diseases. Serum integrin-linked kinase concentration in <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesothelioma</b> was independent of histologic subtype or asbestos exposure. There was no statistically significant impact of serum integrin-linked kinase concentration on prognosis.

40|$|Anti-calretinin {{antibodies}} {{are useful}} to differentiate adenocarcinomas from <b>malignant</b> <b>mesotheliomas</b> of the lung. Therefore, calretinin expression is rarely reported for sarcomatoid mesotheliomas.

For {{the interpretation of}} spindle cell lesions of the pleura, knowledge of calretinin and D 2 - 40 expression frequencies in sarcomatoid mesothelioma is desirable. To systematically investigate the sensitivity of calretinin and D 2 - 40 antibodies in epithelioid and sarcomatoid areas of <b>malignant</b> <b>mesotheliomas,</b> a tissue microarray with 341 <b>malignant</b> <b>mesotheliomas,</b> including 112 epithelioid, 46 sarcomatoid and 183 biphasic tumors was constructed. Epithelioid and sarcomatoid differentiated tumor areas were clearly separated within the tissue microarray.

Calretinin expression was found in 91 % of epithelioid and 57 % of sarcomatoid tumor areas. D 2 - 40 immunostaining was present in 66 % of the epithelioid and 30 % of the sarcomatoid tumor areas.
