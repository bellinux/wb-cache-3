5|$|Fort Cumberland {{was located}} on the Isthmus of Chignecto, which connects modern {{mainland}} Nova Scotia with New Brunswick. The area was strategically important in earlier conflicts between the French colony of Acadia and British-controlled Nova Scotia. Originally built by the French in 1750 as Fort Beauséjour, Fort Cumberland was in deplorable condition. Won from the French in the Battle of Fort Beauséjour in 1755, the fortifications had been <b>minimally</b> garrisoned by the British after the Seven Years' War and abandoned in 1768.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Mary Immaculate Hospital {{opened its}} doors in the only faith-based {{hospital}} on the Peninsula. The Mary Immaculate Hospital is an acute care hospital, and was relocated to the Denbigh area {{of the city and}} offers a wide range of services, including <b>minimally</b> invasive surgery, orthopedic services, The Liver Institute of Virginia, and women's services.|$|E
5|$|Procedural due process, {{arising from}} the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, is <b>minimally</b> the right to notice and a hearing, but has been held to include in some {{circumstances}} rights to counsel and rights to confrontation. Procedural due process is required any time a person faces the deprivation of life, liberty, or property. As substantive due process arises from the liberty clause, a deprivation of a substantive due process right is a deprivation of liberty and thus requires procedural due process.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the epaulette shark as of Least Concern. This species {{is common in}} Australian waters, where it is not captured by either commercial or recreational fisheries, and is <b>minimally</b> affected by collection for the aquarium trade and fishery bycatch. Much of its Australian habitat is encompassed by protected marine parks. Off New Guinea, the epaulette shark has been assessed as Near Threatened, as there it faces habitat degradation, destructive fishing practices, and over-exploitation by artisan fishers.|$|E
5|$|The game's plot – <b>minimally</b> expounded in {{the manual}} – {{concerns}} soldiers partaking in a Middle Eastern conflict (which forms the game's early levels) abducted by aliens {{to do battle}} on an alien world (which forms the later levels). During the process of space travel, the aliens send the soldiers to various times and places, resulting in the intervening medieval and Chicago settings.|$|E
5|$|Type I endometrial carcinomas occur most {{commonly}} before {{and around the}} time of menopause. In the United States they are more common in whites, particularly those with a history of endometrial hyperplasia. Type I endometrial cancers are often low-grade, <b>minimally</b> invasive into the underlying uterine wall (myometrium), estrogen-dependent, and have a good outcome with treatment. Type I carcinomas represent 75–90% of endometrial cancer.|$|E
5|$|Yet if the Benedictine reforms {{dominate}} the sources from this period, their wider impact {{should not be}} overstressed: large areas of England were affected only <b>minimally,</b> if at all. It was the emergence of small local churches {{and the development of}} new systems of pastoral care – processes only imperfectly documented – that would have the more enduring impact and more thoroughgoing effect on religious life in England.|$|E
5|$|A {{technique}} called radioembolization {{is used to}} treat hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastasis. Radioembolization is a low toxicity, targeted liver cancer therapy that uses millions of tiny beads made of glass or resin containing radioactive yttrium-90. The radioactive microspheres are delivered directly to the blood vessels feeding specific liver tumors/segments or lobes. It is <b>minimally</b> invasive and patients can usually be discharged after a few hours. This procedure may not eliminate all tumors throughout the entire liver, but works on one segment or one lobe {{at a time and}} may require multiple procedures.|$|E
5|$|Born to Irish immigrants, Talbot was <b>minimally</b> educated, {{working in}} textile mills {{from an early}} age. He entered into a {{partnership}} with his brother, founding the Talbot Mills of Billerica in 1857. He became politically active, partly due to issues with the mills, and served two terms as Lieutenant Governor, acting as Governor {{for part of the}} second term after Governor William B. Washburn won election to the United States Senate. Talbot was a strong temperance advocate, and his veto of a popular alcohol licensing bill contributed to his loss in the 1874 gubernatorial race. He was more successful in 1878 against divided opposition, serving a single lackluster term.|$|E
5|$|He re-invented the {{practice}} of stiff-arming his tacklers, which {{had gone out of}} favor among running backs in the 1970s. At times, he used his high school experience as a long jumper to leap over his opponents, landing on his head in the end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait was somewhat unusual, as his knees were <b>minimally</b> bent, and the motion was largely powered from the hip. This may have given his knees, a football player's most vulnerable joints, some protection, although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 1983. He referred to this procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup.|$|E
5|$|In April 2005, {{plans for}} a Japanese anime version, Demashita! Powerpuff Girls Z, were announced. The series premiered in Japan the {{following}} year with 52 half-hour episodes, airing each Saturday from July 1 to December 23, 2006, and from January 6 to June 30, 2007. The series deviated from its American predecessor in terms of style, storyline, and characterization, but only <b>minimally</b> retained the essential themes that made the original a success. The characters feature three junior high school students Momoko Akatsutsumi (Hyper Blossom), Miyako Gotokuji (Rolling Bubbles), and Kaoru Matsubara (Powered Buttercup) as the three heroes. A manga adaptation, illustrated by Shiho Komiyuno, was serialized in Shueisha's Ribon magazine between June 2006 and July 2007.|$|E
5|$|In {{most cases}} of early-stage NSCLC, {{removal of a}} lobe of lung (lobectomy) is the {{surgical}} treatment of choice. In people who are unfit for a full lobectomy, a smaller sublobar excision (wedge resection) may be performed. However, wedge resection has {{a higher risk of}} recurrence than lobectomy. Radioactive iodine brachytherapy at the margins of wedge excision may reduce the risk of recurrence. Rarely, removal of a whole lung (pneumonectomy) is performed. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and VATS lobectomy use a <b>minimally</b> invasive approach to lung cancer surgery. VATS lobectomy is equally effective compared to conventional open lobectomy, with less postoperative illness.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{conditions}} that inhibit consciousness are considered disorders of consciousness. This category generally includes <b>minimally</b> conscious state and persistent vegetative state, but sometimes {{also includes the}} less severe locked-in syndrome and more severe chronic coma. Differential diagnosis of these disorders is an active area of biomedical research. Finally, brain death results in an irreversible disruption of consciousness. While other conditions may cause a moderate deterioration (e.g., dementia and delirium) or transient interruption (e.g., grand mal and petit mal seizures) of consciousness, they {{are not included in}} this category.|$|E
5|$|More {{active at}} night {{than during the}} day when it is usually buried in sediment, the bluntnose {{stingray}} is a predator of small benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. This species is aplacental viviparous, in which the unborn young are nourished initially by yolk, and later histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by their mother. Females give birth to 1–6 pups every May after a gestation period of 11–12 months, most of which consists of a period of arrested embryonic development. The venomous tail spine of the bluntnose stingray is potentially dangerous to unwary beachgoers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, as it is widely distributed, common, and <b>minimally</b> threatened by commercial fisheries.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, 2017, McCain {{underwent}} a <b>minimally</b> invasive craniotomy at Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, {{in order to}} remove a blood clot above his left eye. His absence prompted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to delay {{a vote on the}} Better Care Reconciliation Act. Five days later, Mayo Clinic doctors announced that the laboratory results from the surgery confirmed the presence of a glioblastoma, which is a very aggressive brain tumor. Standard treatment options for this tumor include chemotherapy and radiation, although even with treatment, average survival time is approximately 14 months. McCain is a survivor of previous cancers, including melanoma.|$|E
5|$|Pollution {{was not as}} high in New Jersey or Connecticut as in New York, but it {{was still}} significant. New Jersey {{reported}} its worst-ever smog. Elizabeth, New Jersey had smog at half the levels of New York City. A Connecticut health official reported air pollution four times higher than average; Greenwich, Connecticut was <b>minimally</b> impacted. The nearby New York counties of Nassau, Suffolk, and Westchester reported very little smog. Although not part of the area covered by the alert, unusually high smog was reported as far as Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Boston, Massachusetts, whose mayor issued a similar health warning.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia Genesis {{starts with}} the history of {{schizophrenia}}. Gottesman takes the view that schizophrenia is a disease of the industrial world. because it is not mentioned in the Bible, by the ancient Greeks, the ancient physicians, or authors including Shakespeare. He saw it first mentioned by physicians in 1809 and by Balzac in a short story in 1832, showing <b>minimally</b> the disorder had by then been recognized as such. In 1896, Kraepelin defined its symptoms, and his student Ernst Rüdin began a genetic study of its transmission in 1916.} The book noted that schizophrenia existed across cultures and its rates had stayed steady for fifty years.|$|E
5|$|The crowd {{moved away}} from the {{immediate}} area of the custom house, but continued to grow in nearby streets. Captain Preston immediately called out most of the 29th Regiment, which adopted defensive positions in front of the state house. Acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson was summoned to the scene, and was forced by the movement of the crowd into the council chamber of the state house. From its balcony he was able to <b>minimally</b> restore order, promising there would be a fair inquiry into the shootings if the crowd dispersed.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{methoxyflurane}} on the circulatory system {{resemble those of}} diethyl ether. In dogs, methoxyflurane anesthesia causes a moderate decrease in blood pressure with minimal changes in heart rate, and no significant effect on blood sugar, epinephrine, or norepinephrine. Bleeding and increased arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) both induce further decreases in blood pressure, as well as increases in blood glucose, epinephrine and norepinephrine. In humans, methoxyflurane produces some decrease in blood pressure, but cardiac output, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance are only <b>minimally</b> depressed. Its effect on the pulmonary circulation is negligible, {{and it does not}} predispose the heart to cardiac dysrhythmias.|$|E

25|$|BPH can {{be treated}} with medication, a <b>minimally</b> {{invasive}} procedure or, in extreme cases, surgery that removes the prostate. <b>Minimally</b> invasive procedures include transurethral needle ablation of the prostate (TUNA) and transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT). These outpatient procedures may be followed by the insertion of a temporary prostatic stent, to allow normal voluntary urination, without exacerbating irritative symptoms.|$|E

25|$|<b>Minimally</b> {{invasive}} {{procedures have}} been developed in total knee replacement (TKR) that do not cut the quadriceps tendon. There are different definitions of <b>minimally</b> invasive knee surgery, which may include a shorter incision length, retraction of the patella (kneecap) without eversion (rotating out), and specialized instruments. There are few randomized trials, but studies have found less postoperative pain, shorter hospital stays, and shorter recovery. However, no studies have shown long-term benefits.|$|E
