5|$|Gaara {{was created}} a foil to the series' eponymous character, Naruto Uzumaki, {{as the two}} were born through similar circumstances, but develop vastly {{different}} personalities due to a troubled upbringing. His designs and name underwent <b>major</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> making of his final one which also was modified in later arcs to give Gaara a design that is easier to draw. In the Japanese version of the series, Gaara is voiced by Akira Ishida while Liam O'Brien replaces him in the English dub.|$|E
5|$|In the offseason, Houston saw <b>major</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> roster as the Rockets {{acquired}} Tracy McGrady in a seven-player {{deal with}} the Orlando Magic. The 2004–05 season saw McGrady and Yao lead the Rockets to their best record in 10 years, finishing at 51–31 and seeded fifth in the Western Conference playoffs. However, their season ended {{in the first round}} of the playoffs as they lost to their in-state rival, the Dallas Mavericks, in seven games, despite leading the series 2–0.|$|E
5|$|The system expounded by Medhurst {{influenced}} later dictionary compilers {{with regard}} to tonal notation and initials, but both his complicated vowel system and his emphasis on the literary register of Southern Min were dropped by later writers. Following on from Medhurst's work, Samuel Wells Williams became the chief proponent of <b>major</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> orthography devised by Morrison and adapted by Medhurst. Through personal communication and letters and articles printed in The Chinese Repository a consensus was arrived at for the new version of POJ, although Williams' suggestions were largely not followed.|$|E

5|$|World WarII {{contributed to}} <b>major</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nation's economy, {{military}} and foreign policy. The war accelerated {{the process of}} industrialisation, {{led to the development}} of a larger peacetime military and began the process with which Australia shifted the focus of its foreign policy from Britain to the United States. The final effects of the war also contributed to the development of a more diverse and cosmopolitan Australian society.|$|E
5|$|Before the 20th century, Torajans {{lived in}} {{autonomous}} villages, where they practised animism and were relatively {{untouched by the}} outside world. In the early 1900s, Dutch missionaries first worked to convert Torajan highlanders to Christianity. When the Tana Toraja regency was further opened {{to the outside world}} in the 1970s, it became an icon of tourism in Indonesia: it was exploited by tourism development and studied by anthropologists. By the 1990s, when tourism peaked, Toraja society had changed significantly, from an agrarian model—in which social life and customs were outgrowths of the Aluk To Dolo—to a largely Christian society. Today, tourism and remittances from migrant Torajans have made for <b>major</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Toraja highland, giving the Toraja a celebrity status within Indonesia and enhancing Toraja ethnic group pride.|$|E
5|$|In the offseason, Houston saw <b>major</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> roster as the Rockets {{acquired}} Tracy McGrady in a seven-player {{deal with}} the Orlando Magic. The scoring champion McGrady and the strong rebounder Yao formed a well-regarded pair that helped the Rockets win 22 consecutive games in the 2007–08 NBA season, which {{was at the time}} the 3rd longest winning streak in NBA history. Still, the duo was plagued with injuries – of the 463 regular season games for which they were teammates, Yao missed 146 and McGrady 160 – and did not win any playoff series, despite gathering leads over the Dallas Mavericks in 2005 and the Jazz in 2007. After the 2007 elimination, Van Gundy was fired, and the Rockets hired Rick Adelman to replace him.|$|E

5|$|The 1909–10 hockey season saw <b>major</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hockey world, as the ECHA {{organization}} {{split and}} created two organizations, the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA) and the National Hockey Association (NHA). The CHA {{was formed to}} 'freeze out' the Wanderers, whose ownership change led the team {{to move to a}} smaller arena. At the same time, millionaire businessman J. Ambrose O'Brien, who wanted his Renfrew Creamery Kings to challenge for the Stanley Cup, saw his Renfrew application to join the CHA rejected. Together with the Wanderers, O'Brien instead decided to form the NHA, and founded the Montreal Canadiens. The NHA became the fore-runner of today's National Hockey League.|$|E
5|$|The Conservatives {{remained}} {{a minority in}} the House of Commons and {{the passage of the}} Reform Bill required the calling of a new election once the new voting register had been compiled. Disraeli's term as Prime Minister, which began in February 1868, would therefore be short unless the Conservatives won the general election. He made only two <b>major</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cabinet: he replaced Lord Chelmsford as Lord Chancellor with Lord Cairns, and brought in George Ward Hunt as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Derby had intended to replace Chelmsford once a vacancy in a suitable sinecure developed. Disraeli was unwilling to wait, and Cairns, in his view, was a far stronger minister.|$|E
5|$|These {{and other}} major changes brought about major defections among ministers and members, which in turn contributed to a further drop in church revenue. In order to bring the {{finances}} in order, <b>major</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> church infrastructure were implemented. The World Tomorrow, which had seen record numbers of viewers {{in the early years}} of the Tkach administration, was stopped. The Plain Truth publication runs were reduced. Staff at the church headquarters were laid off. The famous, church-subsidized Ambassador Auditorium concert series was canceled and offers were sought for the purchase of the Ambassador College Pasadena campus.|$|E

5|$|Waddington {{licensed}} other editions from 1936 to 1938, and {{the game}} was exported from the UK and resold or reprinted in Switzerland, Belgium, Australia, Chile, The Netherlands, and Sweden. In Italy, under the fascists, the game was changed dramatically {{so that it would}} have an Italian name, locations in Milan, and <b>major</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rules. This was for compliance under Italian law of the period. Italian publishers Editrice Giochi produced the game in Italy until 2009, having held a unique licensing agreement from Parker Brothers and their own copyright dating back to 1935/1936. As of 2009, Hasbro has taken over the publishing of the game in Italy, but have also, for now, kept the Milan-based properties.|$|E
5|$|In {{what was}} Moss's first {{pre-season}} as coach, he {{did little to}} change what Arnold had built at the club. The only <b>major</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> side were {{with the addition of}} Senegalese international Malick Mané and Hungarian Richárd Vernes, and Marcos Flores leaving the club, with Mile Sterjovski retiring. Mariners began the season on a high, progressing to the semi-finals of the 2014 FFA Cup and defeating local rivals Newcastle Jets 1–0 at home in the opening round of the A-League. However the season soon turned with the team failing to secure a win {{for the remainder of the}} year. After their elimination from the 2015 AFC Champions League qualifying play-off by Chinese side Guangzhou R and a continued poor league record after a short mid-season break, the club stood down Moss as head coach. The decision was made on 6 March 2015, with Mariners appointing technical director Tony Walmsley in an interim capacity and captain John Hutchinson in a dual player-coach role, until the end of the season. Portuguese player Fábio Ferreira also joined the team at the tail end of the season. On 15 April Walmsley was announced as Mariners' permanent technical director and head coach for the 2015–16 season. The announcement came despite an end to the season in which the club finished the league in eighth position.|$|E
5|$|Kuala Lumpur {{had seen}} a number of civil {{disturbances}} over the years. A riot in 1897 was a relatively minor affair {{that began with the}} confiscation of faulty dacing (a scale used by traders), and in 1912, a more serious disturbance called the tauchang riot began during the Chinese New Year with the cutting of pigtails and ended with rioting and factional fighting lasting a number of days. The worst rioting on record in Malaysia however occurred on 13 May 1969, when race riots broke out in Kuala Lumpur. The so-called 13 May Incident refers to the violent conflicts that took place between members of the Malay and the Chinese communities. The violence was the result of Malaysian Malays being dissatisfied with their socio-political status. The riots caused the deaths of 196 people according to official figures, and led to <b>major</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country's economic policy to promote and prioritise Malay economic development over that of the other ethnicities.|$|E
