25|$|The Chain Home radar {{transmitters}} {{were built}} by Metrovick at its Trafford Park Works, which {{became part of}} AEI in 1929, GEC in 1968, and as Alstom it was closed in June 2000. 2ZY, the first broadcasts {{in the north of}} England, were made from the Metrovick factory in November 1922, which became part of the BBC National Programme in 1927. GEC opened its first factory in Manchester in 1888, moving to Salford in 1895 at the Peel Works, and had built the Osram electric light company in 1893. The Metropolitan-Vickers F.2 of Trafford Park Works, Manchester was the first axial-flow jet engine, with a nine-stage compressor, first running in 1941. It would end up as the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire and the American-built Wright J65. The F.2 gas turbine would power MGB.2009 the first gas-turbine-powered vessel in 1947. No. 1 Parachute Training School RAF—the <b>main</b> <b>parachute</b> training site for the war—was at RAF Ringway (the Central Landing Establishment and Airborne Forces Experimental Establishment) now Manchester Airport; many aircraft were built there too, and the Ford Trafford Park Factory built 34,000 aircraft engines—mostly Merlin engines; the nearby Metropolitan-Vickers factory built many Lancasters.|$|E
25|$|Komarov. Kamanin, as {{the state}} {{commissioner}} for the Soyuz 1 launch, was present at Baikonur throughout launch preparation that began 6 April 1967. Once the rocket lifted off on 23 April Kamanin {{took charge of the}} first mission control shift. Vladimir Komarov, on his second orbit, reported failure in solar panels - one of them failed to deploy. So far, the situation was manageable, and Kamanin dispatched Gagarin to the second mission control station in Yevpatoria. On the 13th orbit, state commission realized imminent danger and decided to land Komarov and cancel Soyuz 2. 6:45 AM, 24 April while Komarov was still alive, Kamanin boarded the plane departing to the landing area. In the air, Kamanin received the first (incorrect) news of Soyuz descending with a fully deployed parachute. He was not aware of disaster until meeting General Artamonov on the Orsk airfield. Kamanin lost an hour and half travelling to the crash site, only to see the capsule still on fire. Later, the Soyuz 1 parachute failure was linked to an insufficient pilot chute that failed to drag the <b>main</b> <b>parachute</b> from its container.|$|E

40|$|At higher altitudes, {{prior to}} the {{deployment}} of the <b>main</b> <b>parachutes,</b> the Orion spacecraft descent to Earth will rely on deceleration by drogue parachutes. These parachutes have a ribbon construction, and in fluid–structure interaction (FSI) modeling this creates geometric and flow complexities comparable to those encountered in FSI modeling of the <b>main</b> <b>parachutes,</b> which have a ringsail construction. The drogue parachutes {{to be used with}} the Orion spacecraft have 24 gores, with 52 ribbons in each gore, resulting in hundreds of gaps that the flow goes through. We address this computational challenge, as was done for the <b>main</b> <b>parachutes,</b> with the Homogenized Modeling of Geometric Porosity (HMGP). Like the <b>main</b> <b>parachutes,</b> the drogue parachutes will be used in multiple stages, starting with a "reefed" stage where a cable along the parachute skirt constrains the diameter to be less than the diameter in the subsequent stage. After {{a certain period of time}} during the descent, the cable is cut and the parachute "disreefs" (i. e. expands) to the next stage. Computing the parachute shape at the reefed stage and FSI modeling during the disreefing involve computational challenges beyond those in FSI modeling of fully-open drogue parachutes. Orion spacecraft drogue parachutes will have three stages, with FSI modeling of disreefing from Stage 1 to Stage 2 being somewhat more challenging than disreefing from Stage 2 to Stage 3. We present the special modeling techniques we devised to address the computational challenges and the results from the computations carried out. We also present the methods we devised to calculate for a parachute gore the radius of curvature in the circumferential direction. The curvature values are intended for quick and simple engineering analysis in estimating the structural stresses. The flight envelope of the Orion drogue parachutes includes regions where the Mach number is high enough to require a compressible-flow solver. We present some preliminary computations for such cases...|$|R

50|$|After {{its mission}} at the orbital {{laboratory}} was completed, newly arrived Expedition 33 Flight Engineer Kevin Ford used the Canadarm2 robotic arm to detach Dragon from Harmony, maneuver {{it out to}} the 15-meter (50-foot) release point, and release the vehicle. Dragon then performed a series of three burns to place it on a trajectory away from the station. Approximately six hours after Dragon departed the station, it conducted a deorbit burn, which lasted up to 10 minutes. Dragon's trunk, which contains its solar arrays, was then jettisoned.The landing was controlled by automatic firing of its Draco thrusters during reentry. In a carefully timed sequence of events, dual drogue parachutes deploy at an altitude of 13700 m to stabilize and slow the spacecraft. Full deployment of the drogues triggers the release of the three <b>main</b> <b>parachutes,</b> each 35 meters (116 feet) in diameter, at about 3000 m. While the drogues detach from the spacecraft, the <b>main</b> <b>parachutes</b> further slow the spacecraft's descent to approximately 4.8 to 5.4 m/s. Even if Dragon were to lose one of its <b>main</b> <b>parachutes,</b> the two remaining chutes would still permit a safe landing. The Dragon capsule is expected to land in the Pacific Ocean, about 450 km off the coast of southern California. SpaceX uses a 100-foot boat equipped with an A-frame and an articulating crane, a 90-foot crew boat for telemetry operations, and two 24-foot rigid-hull inflatable boats to perform recovery operations. On board are approximately a dozen SpaceX engineers and technicians as well as a four-person dive team. Once the Dragon capsule splashed down, the recovery team secured the vehicle and then placed it on deck for the journey back to shore.|$|R

2500|$|If a skydiver {{experiences}} a malfunction of their <b>main</b> <b>parachute</b> which they cannot correct, they pull a [...] "cut-away" [...] {{handle on the}} front right-hand side of their harness (on the chest) which will release the main canopy from the harness/container. Once free from the malfunctioning main canopy, the reserve canopy can be activated manually by pulling a second handle on the front left harness. Some containers are fitted with a connecting line from the main to reserve parachutes – known as a reserve static line (RSL) – which pulls open the reserve container faster than a manual release could. Whichever method is used, a spring-loaded pilot-chute then extracts the reserve parachute from {{the upper half of}} the container.|$|E
2500|$|Equipment failure rarely causes {{fatalities}} and injuries. Approximately one in 750 deployments of a <b>main</b> <b>parachute</b> {{result in}} a malfunction. Ram-air parachutes typically spin uncontrollably when malfunctioning, and must be jettisoned before deploying the reserve parachute. [...] Reserve parachutes are packed and deployed differently; they are also designed more conservatively and built and tested to more exacting standards so they are more reliable than main parachutes, but the real safety advantage comes from the probability of an unlikely main malfunction multiplied by the even less likely probability of a reserve malfunction. This yields an even smaller probability of a double malfunction although {{the possibility of a}} main malfunction that cannot be cutaway causing a reserve malfunction is a very real risk.|$|E
2500|$|After reentry, a small, drogue {{parachute}} (H) was deployed at [...] for stabilizing the spacecraft's descent.

Just before hitting the water, the landing bag inflated from behind the heat shield to reduce the force of impact (J). Upon landing the parachutes were released. An antenna (K) was raised and sent out signals that could be traced by ships and helicopters. Further, a green marker dye was spread around the spacecraft to make its location more visible from the air. Frogmen brought in by helicopters inflated a collar around the craft to keep it upright in the water. The recovery helicopter hooked onto the spacecraft and the astronaut blew the escape hatch to exit the capsule. He was then hoisted aboard the helicopter that finally brought both him and the spacecraft to the ship.|$|E
