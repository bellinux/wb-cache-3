5|$|One of the <b>most</b> <b>visible</b> Hispanic {{legacies}} is {{the prevalence}} of Spanish names and surnames among Filipinos; a Spanish name and surname, however, does not necessarily denote Spanish ancestry. This peculiarity, unique among the people of Asia, came {{as a result of}} a colonial edict by Governor-General Narciso Clavería y Zaldua, which ordered the systematic distribution of family names and implementation of Hispanic nomenclature on the population.|$|E
5|$|Shaktism {{encompasses}} a nearly endless variety of {{beliefs and practices}} – from animism to philosophical speculation {{of the highest order}} – that seek to access the Shakti (Divine Energy or Power) that {{is believed to be the}} Devi's nature and form.

It is <b>most</b> <b>visible</b> when the grass around it is cut short, for the stones are obscured when the grass grows longer.|$|E
5|$|Today, the Masked Rider, {{with guns}} up, {{leads the team}} onto the field for all home games. This mascot, adorned in a {{distinctive}} gaucho hat like the ones worn {{by members of the}} marching band, is one of the <b>most</b> <b>visible</b> figures at Texas Tech.|$|E
5|$|At {{the four}} corners of the wall sit towers (E) with {{intricate}} roofs boasting 72 ridges, reproducing the Pavilion of Prince Teng and the Yellow Crane Pavilion as they appeared in Song dynasty paintings. These towers are the <b>most</b> <b>visible</b> parts of the palace to commoners outside the walls, and much folklore is attached to them. According to one legend, artisans could not put a corner tower back together after it was dismantled for renovations in the early Qing dynasty, and it was only rebuilt after the intervention of carpenter-immortal Lu Ban.|$|E

There she was a top policy maker who worked actively with the organization's lawyers on issues such as New York City hiring practices, police brutality, the death penalty, and voting rights. The group achieved its <b>most</b> <b>visible</b> triumph when it successfully blocked a city primary election on the grounds that New York City Council boundaries diminished the power of minority voters.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{projects}} such as these constituted only the <b>most</b> <b>visible</b> part of Domitian's religious policy, which also concerned itself with the fulfilment of religious law and public morals. In 85, he nominated himself perpetual censor, the office that held the task of supervising Roman morals and conduct. Once again, Domitian acquitted himself of this task dutifully, and with care. He renewed the Lex Iulia de Adulteriis Coercendis, under which adultery was punishable by exile. From the list of jurors he struck an equestrian who had divorced his wife and taken her back, while an ex-quaestor was expelled from the Senate for acting and dancing.|$|E

40|$|A {{particular}} human {{drive is}} to arrange things into categories, look for patterns and allocate labels. Since ancient times, humans have applied this to life itself.

5|$|Furthermore, despite {{changes to}} the {{campaign}} finance laws, there was no perceptible decrease in campaigning activity. One reason was a compensatory expansion of advertising by way of internet search engines such as Facebook and other social media which were relatively inexpensive. Helsingin Sanomat called election workers in all electoral districts, excluding the Åland Islands, to ask for their assessments of the electoral campaigns. They reported that while the NCP's campaign was the <b>most</b> <b>visible,</b> the Centre Party and the Social Democrats also had high-profile campaigns with some variations across districts. The NCP were also said to be spending more {{of their own money}} than in the past.|$|E

Other merchandise produced includes several sets of action figures, produced by Joyride Studios and McFarlane Toys among other manufacturers. Halos characters have received varying reception, with characters such as the Chief, Cortana, and the Arbiter well received by critics.|$|E
5|$|In the 1682 {{assembly}} of the Riksdag of the Estates, the king put forth his suggestion for military reform, whereby each of the lands of Sweden were to have 1,200 soldiers at the ready, at all times, and two farms were to provide accommodations for one soldier. His soldiers were known as Caroleans, trained to be skilled and preferring to attack rather than defend. Savaging and looting were strictly forbidden. Soldier huts around the country were the <b>most</b> <b>visible</b> {{part of the new}} Swedish allotment system. However, Charles also modernized the military techniques and worked to improve the overall skill and knowledge of the officers by sending them abroad to study.|$|E
50|$|Several modern Pagan {{religions}} are practised at the Medway Megaliths, the <b>most</b> publicly <b>visible</b> {{of which is}} Druidry. Research conducted among these Druids in 2014 revealed that some Druidic ceremonial activity had taken place at Kit's Coty.|$|R
50|$|The <b>most</b> obvious <b>visible</b> {{difference}} is that the lower edges of the cab windows were now angled downwards rather than horizontal. This was to improve visibility at close-range, particularly when being marshalled by a banksman standing nearby.|$|R

5|$|Saturn is {{probably}} {{best known for the}} system of planetary rings that makes it visually unique. The rings extend from 6,630km to 120,700km outward from Saturn's equator, average approximately 20meters in thickness and are composed of 93% water ice with traces of tholin impurities and 7% amorphous carbon. The particles that make up the rings range in size from specks of dust up to 10m. While the other gas giants also have ring systems, Saturn's is the largest and <b>most</b> <b>visible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shed Light was a crash {{development}} project, and {{was largely}} unguided. It was tasked with {{research and development}} of almost any piece of equipment that might help with the mission outlined in its charter. As a result, few of the programs came to fruition and fewer still left a definitive mark on the conflict. The developments under Shed Light were quickly eclipsed by new aircraft produced under Project Gunship (notably under Gunship II and Gunship III). They were fitted with many of the sensors developed under Shed Light, but took on a life all their own. Shed Light’s <b>most</b> <b>visible</b> programs, Black Spot and Tropic Moon, have largely fallen into obscurity.|$|E
