40|$|Magnetorheological dampers {{have become}} {{prominent}} semi-active control devices for vibration mitigation of structures which {{are subjected to}} severe loads. However, the damping force cannot be controlled directly due to the inherent nonlinear characteristics of the magnetorheological dampers. Therefore, for fully exploiting {{the capabilities of the}} magnetorheological dampers, one of the challenging aspects is to develop an accurate inverse model which can appropriately predict the input voltage to control the damping force. In this article, a hybrid modeling strategy combining shuffled frog-leaping algorithm and adaptive-network-based fuzzy <b>inference</b> <b>system</b> is proposed to model the inverse dynamic characteristics of the magnetorheological dampers for improving the modeling accuracy. The shuffled frog-leaping algorithm is employed to optimize the premise parameters of the adaptive-network-based fuzzy <b>inference</b> <b>system</b> while the consequent parameters are tuned by a least square estimation method, here known as shuffled frog-leaping algorithm-based adaptive-network-based fuzzy <b>inference</b> <b>system</b> approach.

Thus, they have lead {{in the development of}} many specialized algorithms looking for one or more particular footprints under distinct settings. Naturally, the performance of such algorithms are not perfect and accordingly the provided output they might be noisy, inaccurate and only partially correct. Furthermore, in practical scenarios, a forged image is often the result of utilizing several tools made available by the image-processing softwares. Therefore, reliable tamper detection requires developing several tools to deal with various tampering scenarios.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{deals with}} the {{prediction}} of chaotic time series by using the multi-stage fuzzy <b>inference</b> <b>system</b> and its application {{to the analysis of}} operating flexibility. Multi-national corporation obtained by shifting manufacturing plants located in different countries is denoted as operating flexibility. Even though the operating flexibility is optimized by the stochastic dynamic programming under the known process of exchange rate, it is usually hard to explicitly predict the change. Therefore, the value of operating flexibility depends on the prediction of time series. Then, we utilize the prediction of exchange rate by using the multi-stage fuzzy <b>inference</b> <b>system.</b> Since we divide the fuzzy <b>inference</b> <b>system</b> and related input variables into several stages, the number of rules included in multi-stage fuzzy <b>inference</b> <b>systems</b> is remarkably smaller compared to conventional fuzzy <b>inference</b> <b>systems.</b> The weight included in inference rules are optimized by the backpropagation algorithm. We also propose a method to optimize the shape of membership function and the appropriate selection of input variables based upon the genetic algorithm (GA). The method is applied to the approximation of typical multi-dimensional chaotic dynamics. The simulation study for multi-dimensional chaotic dynamics shows that the <b>inference</b> <b>system</b> gives a better prediction. The prediction is then applied to estimate the exchange rates by using input variables consisting of economic indicators as well as the exchange rates. The result shows a better performance of the multi-stage fuzzy <b>inference</b> <b>system</b> than when conventional methods are used. Then, we can find effective operating flexibility for shifting the manufacturing plants depending on the predicted exchange rate. 1...|$|R
