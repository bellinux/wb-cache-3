5|$|After {{the player}} defeats the Elite Four {{and enters the}} Champion's chamber, he or she finds that N has {{defeated}} Alder and become the newest Pokémon Champion. Soon after, he summons a large castle that surrounds the Pokémon League, challenging the player to find him {{to take part in}} one final battle. When the player finally reaches him, Reshiram in Black or Zekrom in White appears before the player, and the player must capture the legendary Pokémon before challenging N. After his defeat, N laments the possibility that his ideals are mistaken, Ghetsis intrudes and angrily reveals that his true intentions were to use N to ensure that he would be the only human left with control over Pokémon and use them to rule the world. In his rage, Ghetsis challenges the player to battle. After Ghetsis's defeat, he is arrested, allowing Alder to resume his position as the Pokémon Champion of the Unova region. N then thanks the player for helping realize his <b>mistake</b> <b>about</b> {{the nature of the relationship}} between people and their Pokémon before leaving the castle on his captured Pokémon to a far-off land.|$|E

Persons who have such information and have been withholding it when they know they should report it are leaving themselves open to possible charges of complicity in event the slayer is captured. Make no <b>mistake</b> <b>about</b> {{the fact that the}} slayer will be captured because we will not give up this hunt until he has been captured or killed. All information received will be treated confidentially. We urge you to come in and tell what you know. Don't be hesitant or fear that you are causing an innocent man embarrassment and trouble in as much all investigation will be confidential. This is no time to take any chance on information which might lead us to the slayer. This maniac must be captured. We believe that we are justified in going to any ends to halt this chain of murder. Bear in mind--this killer may strike at any one. He may strike at persons close to him. For that reason, we believe any person with information that may lead us to the murderer should act in the interest of self-preservation.|$|E

Angelica agrees and drinks from the second chalice. Jack is upset to lose Angelica, but reveals that he made a <b>mistake</b> <b>about</b> which chalice contained the tear. Neither of the two are happy, and they both believe Jack deliberately tricked them. Angelica's wounds are healed as the Fountain fatally consumes Blackbeard's body.|$|E
500|$|Several reviews {{considered}} Born Villain to be {{a comeback}} for the band.

[...] Similarly, Kill Hipsters called it [...] "one hell of a comeback for a guy everyone–including myself–thought was well and truly dead and gone." [...] Loudwire's Graham Hartmann praised the album as a whole, as did Rick Florino of Artistdirect, who said: [...] "From top to bottom, it's Manson's most vicious and vibrant effort since Antichrist Superstar.

500|$|... e {{conclude}} that, as in Waters, the government's {{reason for}} demoting Heffernan is what counts here. When an employer demotes an employee {{out of a}} desire to prevent the employee from engaging in political activity that the First Amendment protects, the employee is entitled to challenge that unlawful action under the First Amendment... —even if, as here, the employer makes a factual <b>mistake</b> <b>about</b> the employee's behavior.The Court remanded the case to the Third Circuit and made clear in its opinion that, while it is impermissible to retaliate based upon perceived protected speech, the lower courts should take into consideration whether Heffernan was disciplined for violating any different and neutral policies. The majority provided three main arguments in support of its reasoning: that their interpretation is more in line with the text of the First Amendment, that it better served the First Amendment's purpose of limiting political patronage, and that such an interpretation will not significantly burden employers.|$|E

Success instead came in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, as Leeds knocked out Sarpsborg (Norway), Dynamo Dresden (East Germany), Sparta Prague (Czechoslovakia), Vitória (Portugal) and Liverpool to reach the final with Juventus (Italy). Bremner recovered from an ankle injury just in time to face Liverpool in the semi-finals, and scored the only goal of the two-legged tie with a header at Anfield. Leeds won the final on the away goals rule after recording a 2–2 draw at the Stadio Olimpico di Torino and then a 1–1 draw at Elland Road.|$|E
40|$|Can we make <b>mistakes</b> <b>about</b> what {{rationality}} requires? A natural {{answer is}} that we can, since it is a platitude that rational belief does not require truth; {{it is possible for}} a belief to be rational and mistaken, and this holds for any subject matter at all. However, the platitude causes trouble when applied to rationality itself. The possibility of rational <b>mistakes</b> <b>about</b> what rationality requires generates a puzzle. When combined with two further plausible claims – the enkratic principle, and the claim that rational requirements apply universally – we get the result that rationality generates inconsistent requirements. One popular and attractive solution to the puzzle denies {{that it is possible to}} make rational <b>mistakes</b> <b>about</b> what rationality requires. I show why (contra Titelbaum (2015 b), and Littlejohn (2015) this solution is doomed to fail. Consequently, we are left with the surprising result that solving the puzzle will require pursuing one of three highly unintuitive solutions that have so far not proved popular – we must accept that rationality sometimes generates dilemmas, reject the enkratic principle, or defend a conception of rationality for which the requirements of rationality do not apply universally...|$|R

500|$|In the 2001 case of Kyllo v. United States, Scalia {{wrote the}} Court's opinion in a 5–4 {{decision}} that cut across ideological lines. That decision found thermal imaging {{of a home}} to be an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment. The Court struck down a conviction for marijuana manufacture based on a search warrant issued after such scans were conducted, which showed that the garage was considerably hotter {{than the rest of}} the house because of indoor growing lights. Applying that Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable search and seizure to arrest, Scalia dissented from the Court's 1991 decision in County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, allowing a 48-hour delay before a person arrested without a warrant is taken before a magistrate, on the ground that at the time of the adoption of the Fourth Amendment, an arrested person was to be taken before a magistrate as quickly as practicable. In a 1990 First Amendment case, R.A.V. v. St. Paul, Scalia wrote the Court's opinion striking down a St. Paul, Minnesota, hate speech ordinance in a prosecution for burning a cross. Scalia noted, [...] "Let there be no <b>mistake</b> <b>about</b> our belief that burning a cross in someone's front yard is reprehensible.

Scalia's concurrence, signed by the other three justices, complained that her opinion left open the question of how courts should resolve the question if the employer's belief was found to be unreasonable. [...] "Loose ends are the inevitable consequence of judicial invention," [...] he complained. [...] "We will spend decades trying to improvise the limits of this new First Amendment procedure that is unmentioned in text and unformed by tradition."

When it became apparent a few months later, however, that the record {{would no longer be}} a solo album {{and that it would be}} significantly different in style musically from the previous records, Darnell told interviewers at the time that it was [...] "a chance to do some other things", but in reality he felt he was being forced to do [...] "a cop-out album, an R album" [...] in order to ease ZE's considerable financial difficulties with their parent label in the US, Sire Records. By the time of the album's release in May 1982, Darnell acknowledged that his record company had put pressure on him and that the record had not turned out how he had wanted: [...] "Make no <b>mistake</b> <b>about</b> it, this album is a compromise. It's much more steeped in R than Kid Creole should be. That's why it originally was supposed to be an August Darnell solo album.
