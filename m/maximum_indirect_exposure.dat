40|$|Spreading broadly {{refers to}} the notion of an entity {{propagating}} throughout a networked system via its interacting components. Evidence of its ubiquity and severity can be seen in a range of phenomena, from disease epidemics to financial systemic risk. In order to understand the dynamics of these critical phenomena, computational models map the probability of propagation as a function of direct exposure, typically in the form of pairwise interactions between components. By doing so, the important role of <b>indirect</b> <b>exposure</b> remains unexplored. In response, we develop a simple model that accounts for the effect of both direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>exposure,</b> which we deploy in the novel context of failure propagation within a real-world engineering project. We show that <b>indirect</b> <b>exposure</b> has a significant effect in key aspects, including the: (a) final spreading event size, (b) propagation rate, and (c) spreading event structure. In addition, we demonstrate the existence of hidden influentials in large-scale spreading events, and evaluate the role of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>exposure</b> in their emergence. Given the evidence of the importance of <b>indirect</b> <b>exposure,</b> our findings offer new insight on particular aspects that need to be included when modelling network dynamics in general, and spreading processes specifically.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundAlthough rabbits are {{becoming}} popular as pets, {{data about the}} characteristics of allergic sensitization to rabbit allergens in patients without professional exposure are scarce. Aims of the studyTo determine the characteristics of allergic sensitization to pet rabbits, {{and the role of}} direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>exposure</b> to rabbits and rabbit allergens in non-professionally exposed patients. MethodsFrom among 1124 consecutive outpatients, we selected all subjects with an immediate skin reaction to rabbit dander. A clinical history including a careful evaluation of the modality of rabbit exposure, the results of skin-prick tests (SPTs) and total/specific IgE antibodies were recorded. The prevalence of rabbit ownership in the Naples area was also calculated. ResultsAmong 753 SPT-positive patients, 20 (2. 65 %) were sensitized to rabbit dander (5 patients were mono-sensitized). Fifteen patients reported direct rabbit contact (7 were rabbit owners and 8 had occasional contact outside the home); 3 patients had <b>indirect</b> <b>exposure</b> through contact with rabbit owners and 2 patients denied any direct or <b>indirect</b> <b>exposure.</b> Rabbit mono-sensitized owners of pet rabbits had persistent (moderate-severe) symptoms. The prevalence of rabbit ownership is 1. 56 %. ConclusionsIn susceptible not professionally exposed individuals, direct rabbit contact and, in some cases, indirect or no apparent exposure, may induce allergic sensitization to rabbit allergens. A progressive increase in rabbit sensitization (also by <b>indirect</b> <b>exposure)</b> may be expected {{as a consequence of the}} increase in rabbit ownership...|$|R

40|$|Maternal {{exposure}} {{during pregnancy}} to toxins can occasionally lead to miscarriage and malformation. It is currently thought that toxins {{pass through the}} placental barrier, albeit bilayered in the first trimester, and damage the fetus directly, albeit at low concentration. Here we examined the responses of human embryonic stem (hES) cells in tissue culture to two metals at low concentration. We compared direct <b>exposures</b> with <b>indirect</b> <b>exposures</b> across a bi-layered model of the placenta cell barrier. Direct exposure caused increased DNA damage without apoptosis or a loss of cell number but with some evidence of altered differentiation. <b>Indirect</b> <b>exposure</b> caused increased DNA damage and apoptosis but without loss of pluripotency. This was not caused by metal ions passing through the barrier. Instead the hES cells responded to signalling molecules (including TNF-α) secreted by the barrier cells. This mechanism was dependent on connexin 43 mediated intercellular ‘bystander signalling’ both within and between the trophoblast barrier and the hES colonies. These results highlight key differences between direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>exposure</b> of hES cells across a trophoblast barrier to metal toxins. It offers a theoretical possibility that an indirectly mediated toxicity of hES cells might have biological relevance to fetal development...|$|R

40|$|While {{there is}} a {{considerable}} number of studies on the relationship between the risk of disease or death and direct exposure from the atomic bomb in Hiroshima, the risk for <b>indirect</b> <b>exposure</b> caused by residual radioactivity has not yet been fully evaluated. One of the reasons is that risk assessments have utilized estimated radiation doses, but {{that it is difficult to}} estimate <b>indirect</b> <b>exposure.</b> To evaluate risks for other causes, including <b>indirect</b> radiation <b>exposure,</b> as well as direct exposure, a statistical method is described here that evaluates risk with respect to individual location at the time of atomic bomb exposure instead of radiation dose. In addition, it is also considered to split the risks into separate risks due to direct exposure and other causes using radiation dose. The proposed method is applied to a cohort study of Hiroshima atomic bomb survivors. The resultant contour map suggests that the region west to the hypocenter has a higher risk compared to other areas. This in turn suggests that there exists an impact on risk that cannot be explained by direct exposure...|$|R

40|$|<b>Indirect</b> <b>exposure</b> {{approaches}} offer a feasible {{and accurate}} method for estimating population exposures to indoor pollutants, including {{environmental tobacco smoke}} (ETS). In {{an effort to make}} the <b>indirect</b> <b>exposure</b> assessment approach more accessible to people in the health and risk assessment fields, this paper provides examples using real data from (italic>a(/italic>) a week-long personal carbon monoxide monitoring survey conducted by the author; and (italic>b(/italic>) the 1992 to 1994 National Human Activity Pattern Survey (NHAPS) for the United States. The indirect approach uses measurements of exposures in specific microenvironments (e. g., homes, bars, offices), validated microenvironmental models (based on the mass balance equation), and human activity pattern data obtained from questionnaires to predict frequency distributions of exposure for entire populations. This approach requires fewer resources than the direct approach to exposure assessment, for which the distribution of monitors to a representative sample of a given population is necessary. In the <b>indirect</b> <b>exposure</b> assessment approach, average microenvironmental concentrations are multiplied by the total time spent in each microenvironment to give total integrated exposure. By assuming that the concentrations encountered in each of 10 location categories are the same for different members of the U. S. population (i. e., the NHAPS respondents), the hypothetical contribution that ETS makes to the average 24 -hr respirable suspended particle exposure for Americans working their main job is calculated in this paper to be 18 microg/m 3.

Items were used to ascertain high and moderate disaster exposure groups and an <b>indirect</b> <b>exposure</b> comparison group. Results Long-term PTS trajectories were best characterized by a resilient (72. 3 %), a severe chronic (4. 6 %), a moderate chronic (11. 2 %) and a recovering (11. 9 %) trajectory. Trajectories {{reported higher levels of}} PTS than the comparison group. Exposure severity and bereavement were highly influential risk factors. Conclusions These findings have implications regarding anticipation of long-term psychological adjustment after natural disasters and need for interventions after a single traumatic event with few secondary stressors...|$|R
