40|$|A planar {{graphene}} metasurface with rectangular holes, {{which is}} capable of supporting a dynamically tunable Fano resonance at Terahertz (THz) frequencies, is proposed. The rectangular hole is patterned asymmetrically within the <b>metasurface's</b> <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> to 'brighten' an originally-dark quadrupolar surface plasmon mode. Fano resonance is achieved via the destructive interference of this mode with a dipolar surface plasmon. The spectral location and line shape of the Fano resonance can be dynamically tuned via a gate voltage applied to the metasurface to change graphene's optical properties.

40|$|Non-uniform metasurfaces (electrically thin {{composite}} layers) can be {{used for}} shaping refracted and reflected electromagnetic waves. However, known design approaches based on the generalized refraction and reflection laws do not allow realization of perfectly performing devices: there are always some parasitic reflections into undesired directions. In this paper we introduce and discuss a general approach to the synthesis of metasurfaces for full control of transmitted and reflected plane waves and show that perfect performance can be realized. The method is based on the use of an equivalent impedance matrix model which connects the tangential field components at the two sides on the metasurface. With this approach we are able to understand what physical properties of the metasurface are needed in order to perfectly realize the desired response. Furthermore, we determine the required polarizabilities of the <b>metasurface</b> <b>unit</b> <b>cells</b> and discuss suitable cell structures. It appears that only spatially dispersive metasurfaces allow realization of perfect refraction and reflection of incident plane waves into arbitrary directions. In particular, ideal refraction is possible only if the metasurface is bianisotropic (weak spatial dispersion), and ideal reflection without polarization transformation requires spatial dispersion with a specific, strongly non-local response to the fields.

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{rectenna}} systems {{almost half a}} century ago has enabled numerous applications in a number of areas, with the main goal of recycling the ambient microwave energy. In previously presented rectennas, microstrip antennas were the main energy source used to capture and convert microwaves to AC power. However, the conversion efficiency of antennas have never been examined in terms of their capability of absorbing microwave energy, and hence any enhancements to the overall efficiency of rectenna systems were mainly attributed to the rectification circuitry instead of the antenna. In {{the first part of this}} dissertation, a novel electromagnetic energy collector is presented, consisting of an array of Split Ring Resonators (SRRs), used for the first time as the main electromagnetic source of energy in a rectenna system. The SRR array is compared to an array of patch antennas to determine the radiation to AC efficiency when both arrays are placed on the same footprint. Numerical simulations and experimental tests show that the SRRs achieve higher efficiency and wider bandwidth than microstrip antennas. The idea of electromagnetic energy harvesting using metamaterials is further explored by designing a metamaterial slab based on the full absorption concept. The metasurface material parameters are tuned to achieve a surface that is matched to the free space impedance at a certain band of frequencies to minimize any reflections and ensure full absorption within the metasurface. The absorbed energy is then channeled to a resistive load placed within each element of the metasurface. Different from previous metasurface absorber designs, here the power absorbed is mostly dissipated across the load resistance instead of the substrate material. A case study is considered where the metamaterial slab is designed to operate at 3 GHz. The simulation and experimental results show radiation to AC efficiencies of 97 % and 93 %, respectively. A novel method is proposed in the second part of the thesis that significantly increases the conversion efficiency of electromagnetic energy harvesting systems. The method is based on utilizing the available vertical volume above a 2 -D flat panel by vertically stacking panels while maintaining the same 2 -D footprint. The concept is applied to SRRs and folded dipole antennas. In both cases, four vertically stacked arrays are compared to a single array panel, both occupying the same flat 2 -D footprint in terms of power efficiency. The numerical and experimental results for both the SRRs and the antennas show that the stacking concept can increase the conversion efficiency by up to five times when compared to a single 2 -D flat panel. The third part presents the design of a near unity electromagnetic energy harvester that uses a Tightly Coupled Antenna array. Compared to the <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> of metamaterial surfaces, the dimension of a TCA <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> is about five times larger, thus providing simplified channeling networks and cost-effective solutions. The TCA surface contains an array of Vivaldi shape <b>unit</b> <b>cells</b> with a diode at each cell to convert the harvested electromagnetic energy to dc power. The dc power from each <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> is channeled to one single load via series inductors. A sample 4 X 4 TCA array, when simulated, fabricated and tested shows solid agreement between the simulated and measured results. The thesis then discusses the idea and design of a dually polarized metasurface for electromagnetic energy harvesting. A 4 X 4 super cell with alternating vias between adjacent cells is designed to allow for capturing the energy from various incident angles at an operating frequency of 2. 4 GHz. The collected energy is then channeled to a feeding network that collects the AC power and feeds it to rectification circuitry. The simulation results yield a radiation to AC, and AC to DC conversion efficiencies of around 90 % and 80 %, respectively. As a proof of concept, an array consisting of nine super cells is fabricated and measured. The experimental results show that the proposed energy harvester is capable of capturing up to 70 % of the energy from a plane wave with various incident angles and then converting it to usable DC power. As future work, the last part introduces the concept of metasurface energy harvesting in the infrared regime. The <b>metasurface</b> <b>unit</b> <b>cells</b> consist of an H-shaped resonator with the load placed across the gap of the resonator. Different from infrared meta-material absorber designs, the resonator is capable of not only full absorption but also maximum energy channeling across the load resistance. The numerical simulation demonstrates that 96 % of the absorbed energy is dissipated across the load resistance. In addition, a cross-polarized H-resonator design is presented that is capable of harvesting infrared energy using dual polarization within three frequency bands...|$|R

To simplify these designs, a symmetrical CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> having equal input and output impedance is proposed. In the design of TDDLs, the symmetrical CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> with higher time-delay efficiency helps achieve a size reduction of 67. 9 %, compared with the TTDL designed using right-handed transmission line (RH TL). The symmetrical CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> is further modified to a compact CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> to further reduce the size by 58 %. For performances comparison, the TTDLs using the compact CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cells,</b> symmetrical CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cells</b> and RH TL are studied using computer simulation and measurement. Results show that the TTDLs using the compact CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cells</b> can achieve much longer time delays. The TTDLs designed using CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cells</b> have narrow bandwidths because CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cells</b> have narrow bandwidths. In this thesis, a wideband <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> obtained by rotating the CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> by 900 is proposed {{in the design of}} TTDLs. Simulation and measurement show that the TTDL using wideband <b>unit</b> <b>cells</b> can achieve a time delay about 3 times and 6 times longer than that of the periodic microstrip line (PML) and RH TL, respectively. A 2 -bit, 3 -bit and 6 -bit phase shifters using symmetrical CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cells</b> are designed using computer simulation. In these designs, positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) diodes mounted on the fingers of the CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cells</b> are used as switches to control the phase response at the output. Different phase shifts are achieved using different switching states determined by controlling bits. The phase shifters are fabricated and measured. Simulated and measured results agree very well. Power-handling capability is also analyzed using surface-current density on the CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cells.</b> Results show that the phase shifters have much higher power-handling capabilities than that of the PIN diodes. A wideband 1800 -switched-line phase shifter using symmetrical CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> is proposed. The switched-line phase shifter employs a symmetrical CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> as the reference arm and a RH TL as the delay arm to produce a constant phase shift across a wide frequency band. For comparison, a traditional 1800 -switched-line phase shifter using RH TLs for both reference and delay arms is also designed. To reduce the size, the CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> is realized using lump elements (LEs).
