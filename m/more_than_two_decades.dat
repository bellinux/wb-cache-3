40|$|Challenged by {{a global}} crisis, the {{building}} industry is currently seeking new orientation and strategies. Stakeholders in {{the built environment}} are being forced at an extensive and unprecedented pace to improve a set of conflicting objectives.

On the other hand, the market demands that the functional performance, indoor quality, comfort levels and social sustainability of the building shall be increased. And at the same time, building professionals concentrate on the reduction of energy consumption, the ecological footprint of a building process and its carbon emission, boosting the environmental sustainability.

5|$|Whatever {{the true}} impact of Marwan's campaigns, warfare between the Khazars and the Arabs ceased for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> after 737.

Despite the Umayyad success at establishing a more or less stable frontier anchored at Derbent, Blankinship is also critical of the long-term results of the Second Arab–Khazar War: Arab control was in reality limited to the lowlands and coast, and the land itself was too poor to recompense the expenses sustained during the wars. Furthermore, the need to maintain the large garrison at Derbent further depleted the already overstretched Syro-Jaziran army, the main pillar of the Umayyad regime. Eventually, this weakening of the Syrian army would be the major factor in the fall of the Umayyad dynasty during the Muslim civil wars of the 740s and the Abbasid Revolution that followed them.|$|E
