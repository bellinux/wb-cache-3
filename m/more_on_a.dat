5|$|Louisville {{took over}} on offense needing {{to get a}} {{touchdown}} to regain a lead before the waning clock finally ran out of time. After the Tech kickoff and a touchback, the Cardinals took over at their 20-yard line. Michael Bush ran for 10yards and a first down, and Hunter Cantwell scrambled for six <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rushing play. Facing third down and needing four yards, Cantwell dropped back to pass for the first down. As the pass soared through the air, Tech defender James Anderson jumped and caught the ball, intercepting it. Still on his feet, Anderson quickly rushed the other way and, unimpeded, ran 39yards {{into the end zone}} for a Virginia Tech touchdown. The score and extra point energized Virginia Tech's offense and defense and gave the Hokies an 11-point lead—35–24—with 4:45 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{second quarter}} began with Alabama in {{possession}} of the ball and facing first down and 21 yards at their 40-yard line. Zow completed a seven-yard pass to Hall, then Alexander lost three yards on a running play, setting up third down and 17. Alabama gained the needed yardage and <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 24-yard pass from Zow to Alexander at the Tech 32-yard line. On first down, Alexander was tackled for a four-yard loss. Zow regained the lost yards with a completion to Alexander at the Tech 25-yard line. After a one-yard rush, Alabama faced fourth down and one yard at the Tech 23-yard line. Alexander ran to the Tech 20-yard line and gained the first down. After a four-yard rush, Zow completed a pass to Quincy Jackson for no gain, setting up third down. Zow scrambled for a first down at the Tech nine-yard line. Alexander advanced to the five-yard line on a running play, and Zow completed a touchdown pass to Vaughn for the Tide's first points of the game. The extra point kick was successful, and with 9:13 remaining in the first half, the game was tied, 77.|$|E

5|$|With {{the ongoing}} {{conflict}} with Chart House {{on the mind}} of the company's board in 1978, Burger King hired McDonald's executive Donald N. Smith to help revamp the company. Smith initiated a restructuring of all future franchising agreements. New owners were barred from living more than an hour's drive from their restaurants, corporations were not permitted to own franchises, and franchisees could no longer operate other chains. This new policy effectively limited the size of franchisees and prevented larger franchises from challenging Burger King as Chart House had. It also became a requirement for the corporation to own the properties of any new store and lease them to franchisees. This policy would allow the company to take over the operations of failing stores or evict those owners who would not conform to the company guidelines and policies. Beyond the changes to the franchise system, Smith also restructured Burger King's corporate operations to better compete against his former employer as well as then up and coming chain Wendy's. He broadened the product offering by adding the Burger King specialty sandwich line in 1979, and also added many non-hamburger sandwiches including new chicken and fish offerings. The new line {{was one of the first}} attempts by a major fast food chain to target a specific demographic, in this case adults aged between 18 and 34 years, members of which were presumably willing spend <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> higher quality product. The new products were successful and the company's sales increased by 15%.|$|E

25|$|With 2:36 {{left and}} with all three timeouts, Hostetler and the Giants began driving again. He hit Mark Bavaro for {{nineteen}} yards on the first play and later hit Stephen Baker for thirteen <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> second down {{to set up a}} short run by Ottis Anderson for two yards and a first down. The Giants called two running plays to get the ball {{to the middle of the}} field, and with four seconds left Bahr was called on to try to win the game. His kick went through the uprights as time ran out and the Giants won 15–13.|$|E

25|$|He loved celebrities, so {{he painted}} them as well. From these {{beginnings}} he developed his later style and subjects. Instead {{of working on}} a signature subject matter, as he started out to do, he worked more and <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> signature style, slowly eliminating the handmade from the artistic process. Warhol frequently used silk-screening; his later drawings were traced from slide projections.

25|$|For a short time, under Captain Josiah Myrick, Shoshone carried {{miners and}} their {{equipment}} from Olds Ferry to the mining areas around Boise. The mining traffic {{then took a}} different route, {{and there was no}} business for the Shoshone. She was laid up for three years, with only two watchmen keeping an eye on her. This was frustrating for O.S.N. which had enjoyed spectacular success with almost all of its boats, often earning <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> single trip than it had cost (generally not long before) to build the steamboat in the first place.|$|E
25|$|Rigg was {{initially}} {{unhappy with the}} way she was treated by the show's producers. During her first series she learned she was being paid less than the camera man. She demanded a raise, to put her <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> par with her co-star, or she would leave the show. The producers gave in, thanks to the show's great popularity in the US. At the end of the fifth series in 1967, Rigg left to pursue other projects. This included following Honor Blackman to play a leading role in a James Bond film, in this case On Her Majesty's Secret Service as James Bond's wife Tracy Bond.|$|E

25|$|In 1998 {{the band}} {{released}} the single Lisbon, {{followed by the}} album Fireworks, produced by Chris Tsangarides. Fireworks was a departure from Angra's earlier experimental sound, focusing <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> neo-classical metal sound and lacking the Brazilian rhythms that were included in Holy Land. The album was the first for the Steamhammer label and appeared in North America through Century Media. A lengthy world tour {{was set up in}} support for the album. The band appeared at the Buenos Aires edition of Monsters of Rock, while they co-headlined shows in Europe with Time Machine and Stratovarius in 1999. Bruce Dickinson made a guest appearance during the Paris show, while the band also performed at the Wacken Open Air festival.|$|E
25|$|The Marshall Plan aid {{was divided}} among the {{participant}} states on a roughly per capita basis. A larger amount {{was given to}} the major industrial powers, as the prevailing opinion was that their resuscitation was essential for general European revival. Somewhat more aid per capita was also directed towards the Allied nations, with less for those that {{had been part of the}} Axis or remained neutral. The exception was Iceland, which had been neutral during the war, but received far <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> per capita basis than the second highest recipient. The table below shows Marshall Plan aid by country and year (in millions of dollars) from The Marshall Plan Fifty Years Later. There is no clear consensus on exact amounts, as different scholars differ on exactly what elements of American aid during this period were part of the Marshall Plan.|$|E
25|$|For {{a period}} Ethiopia lacked a {{permanent}} capital; instead, the royal encampment {{served as a}} roving capital. For a time Menelik's camp was on Mount Entoto, but in 1886, while Menelik was on campaign in Harar, Empress Taytu Betul camped at a hot spring {{to the south of}} Mount Entoto. She decided to build a house there and from 1887 this was her permanent base, which she named Addis Ababa ('new flower'). Menelik's generals were all allocated land nearby to build their own houses, and in 1889 work began in a new royal palace. the city grew rapidly, and by 1910 the city had around 70,000 permanent inhabitants, with up to 50,000 <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> temporary basis. Only in 1917, after Menelik's death, was the city reached by the railway from Djibouti.|$|E

25|$|After {{their victory}} over Mississippi State, Alabama reentered the AP Poll at the No.19 {{position}} and LSU {{was in the}} No.11 position in the week prior to their match-up at Birmingham. Playing in a regionally televised game, Alabama was defeated by the Tigers 14–9 at Legion Field. Richard Ciemny gave Alabama an early 3–0 lead with his 23-yard field goal in the first, but the Tigers responded with a two-yard Arthur Cantrelle touchdown run {{in the second quarter}} that gave LSU a 7–3 halftime lead. The Tigers extended their lead further to 14–3 after Felix Lee threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Jimmy LeDoux in the third quarter. Although the Crimson Tide defense had a goal line stand that prevented a late LSU score, the offense only scored once <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> ten-yard Scott Hunter touchdown pass to David Bailey that made the final score 14–9. The loss brought Alabama's all-time record against LSU to 20–10–4.|$|E
25|$|The {{main event}} and the semi-main event both {{stemmed from the}} same storyline, pitting the team of Los Guerreros del Infierno (Último Guerrero and Rey Bucanero) against the tecnico team of Shocker and Vampiro Canadiense. The storyline started not long after Guerrero and Bucanero {{defeated}} Negro Casas and El Hijo del Santo to win the CMLL World Tag Team Championship in mid-2002 and originally centered around Los Guerreros championship, with Shocker and Vampiro chasing the title. The two teams met {{in one of the}} feature matches at the CMLL 69th Anniversary Show where Los Guerreros successfully defended the tag team title. Following the title defense the storyline split into two, with Último Guerrero focusing on Shocker, demanding a match for Shocker's CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship. In the other storyline the feud between Bucanero and Vampiro focused <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Lucha de Apuestas or bet match challenge. Since neither held a singles championship they would both bet their hair against the outcome of the match and be shaved bald in case they lost. The Luchas de Apuestas match is the most prestigious match type in Lucha Libre, which is why it was chosen over the championship match to main event the show. In the semi-main event Último Guerrero won the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship after forcing Shocker to submit to his own trademark submission hold La Reienera (a Modified spinning backbreaker rack). In the main event Vampiro gained a measure of revenge for his tag team partner as he defeated Rey Bucanero, pinning him to win the third and deciding fall. Following the match Bucanero's long hair was cut off and then the rest of his hair was shaved off as per the Lucha Libre traditions.|$|E
