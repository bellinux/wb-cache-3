40|$|An {{investigation}} of active control communications {{sponsored by the}} NASA Langley Research Center is summarized. Particular attention is given to comparative architectures, for which {{a common set of}} requirements is generated as a baseline. Most of the requirements are aircraft functional in nature, such as stability and command augmentation, structural load relief, flight path control, flight control linkage, flight monitoring, management, navigation, engine control, and ground communication; the time element, the hazard environment, and the communications capacity estimation are also important factors. The architectures involve several communication technologies, including dedicated links, broadcast busing, and multiplex busing. The <b>multiplex</b> <b>bus</b> system provides the greatest flexibility and installation efficiency. A future homogeneous network system is also proposed, which would be fault and damage tolerant and would, with advanced technology, avoid the problems of designing a very large and flight critical <b>multiplex</b> <b>bus</b> system...|$|R
50|$|These goals {{resulted}} in a microcomputer with a <b>multiplexed</b> <b>bus</b> architecture, with just two buses for all functions: the time-multiplexed data bus and a 7-bit control bus for synchronizing the system's components relative to the data bus. The functions of the F8 were distributed among several devices resulting in system simplification.|$|E
50|$|The R18000 was a {{canceled}} {{further development}} of the R10000 microarchitecture that featured major improvements by Silicon Graphics, Inc. described at the Hot Chips symposium in 2001. The R18000 was designed specifically for SGI's ccNUMA servers and supercomputers. Each node would have two R18000s connected via a <b>multiplexed</b> <b>bus</b> to a system controller, which interfaced the microprocessors to their local memory {{and the rest of}} the system via a hypercube network.|$|E
50|$|The on-die memory {{controller}} supports 256 MB to 16 GB of 133 MHz DDR-I SDRAM. The {{memory is}} accessed via a 137-bit memory bus, of which 128 bits are for data and 9 are for ECC. The memory bus has a peak bandwidth of 4.2 GB/s. The microprocessor {{was designed to}} support four-way multiprocessing. Jbus is used to connect up to four microprocessors. It is a 128-bit address and data <b>multiplexed</b> <b>bus</b> that operates at one half or {{one third of the}} microprocessor's clock frequency.|$|E

50|$|The R4000 used a 64-bit {{system bus}} called the SysAD bus. The SysAD bus was an address and data <b>multiplexed</b> <b>bus,</b> that is, it {{used the same}} set of wires to {{transfer}} data and addresses. While this reduced bandwidth, it was also less expensive than providing a separate address bus, which would have required more pins and increased the complexity of the system. The SysAD bus can be configured to operate at half, a third or a quarter of the internal clock frequency. The SysAD bus generates its clock signal by dividing the operating frequency.|$|E
50|$|TURBOchannel is a 32-bit {{address and}} data <b>multiplexed</b> <b>bus,</b> clocked at {{frequencies}} between 12.5 and 25 MHz, {{with a maximum}} theoretical usable bandwidth of 90 MB/s. The bus however differs from others at the time by having point to point control lines. The firmware contained within TURBOchannel cards is MIPS machine code, a remnant of the bus' original use in MIPS-based systems. Because of this, later systems that used this bus such as the Alpha-based DEC 3000 AXP used an emulator contained in its system firmware to properly initialize them.|$|E
50|$|The {{processor}} has a 24-bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) and overlapped {{processing of}} several instructions (a so-called pipeline) {{which are the}} two primary reasons for its speed. Unlike the older Z280 and Z380 {{it does not have}} (or need) a cache memory. Instead, it is intended to work with fast SRAM directly as main memory (as this had become much cheaper). Nor does it have the <b>multiplexed</b> <b>bus</b> of the Z280, making it as easy to work with (interface to) as the original Z80 and Z180, and equally predictable when it comes to exact execution times.|$|E

50|$|The TURBOchannel bus uses a 32-bit {{data and}} address <b>multiplexed</b> <b>bus</b> for {{transferring}} data and addresses. Every TURBOchannel option slot {{has its own}} set of seven point-to-point control lines and five lines for universal control and arbitration. The point-to-point control lines are connected directly to the TURBOchannel interface. The TURBOchannel interface was not defined in the TURBOchannel specification, although Digital introduced three possible schemes and an example ASIC. The three possible schemes were divided into a low-cost, a mid-range and high performance system implementations. The system can either time-multiplex multiple option slots in order to use a single memory port to share its bandwidth or dedicate a memory port to each option slot.|$|E
5000|$|Like most busses of the era, GIO was a 32-bit {{address and}} data <b>multiplexed</b> <b>bus</b> that was {{normally}} clocked at 25 or 33 MHz. This {{meant that the}} bus uses the same path for addressing and data, thus normally requiring three cycles to transfer a single 32-bit value; one cycle to send the address, the next to send the data and then another to read or write it. This limited the bus to a maximum throughput of about 16 Mbyte/s at 33 MHz for these sorts of small transfers. However the system also included a long-burst read/write mode that allowed continual transfers of up to 4 kilobytes of data (the fundamental page size in R3000-based SGI machines); using this mode dramatically increased the throughput to 132 Mbyte/s (32 bits per cycle * 33 MHz). GIO also included a [...] "real time" [...] interrupt allowing devices to interrupt these long transfers if needed. Bus arbitration was controlled by the Processor Interface Controller (PIC) in the original R3000-based SGI Indigo systems.|$|E

The output of a 40 mm-radius micro-ring laser is vertically coupled to a passive waveguide bus and the chip is subsequently mounted in a butterfly package with fibre pigtailing at both input and output. In {{the first such}} experiment with a micro-ring-based module, a wavelength channel is added into a wavelength multiplexed fibre-optic link with negligible power penalty. Successful transmission of a 2 λ x 2. 5 Gbit/s signal over 25 km is demonstrated for a 0. 9 nm channel spacing. ...|$|E

The bus adapter is configured as either a bus controller of a remote terminal interface. It is coupled directly to the <b>multiplex</b> <b>bus,</b> or stub coupled through an additional isolation transformer located at the connection point.

50|$|The 8085 is {{supplied}} in a 40-pin DIP package. To maximise the functions on the available pins, the 8085 uses a <b>multiplexed</b> address/data <b>bus.</b> However, an 8085 circuit requires an 8-bit address latch, so Intel manufactured several support chips with an address latch built in. These include the 8755, with an address latch, 2 KB of EPROM and 16 I/O pins, and the 8155 with 256 bytes of RAM, 22 I/O pins and a 14-bit programmable timer/counter.

40|$|The {{basic module}} {{consists}} of a minicomputer, low cost peripheral storage device (disk) and a modest number (8 - 12) of microcomputer modules.

By running the machine in a dedicated mode {{for long periods of}} time, {{it will be possible to}} obtain a large number of solutions. As such, the device should be useful as a research tool. A scheme is outlined to assemble a number of these computing modules in parallel to decrease computing time. The advantages and disadvantages are discussed of using a number of these systems assembled in a loosely coupled configuration, each independently computing a separate flow, to give a very high throughput...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{a class of}} irredundant low power encoding techniques for memory address buses. The basic idea is to partition the memory space {{into a number of}} sectors. These sectors can, for example, represent address spaces for the code, heap, and stack segments of one or more application programs. Each address is first dynamically mapped to the appropriate sector and then is encoded with respect to the sector head. Each sector head is updated based on the last accessed address in that sector. The result of this sector-based encoding technique is a {{reduction in the number of}} bus transitions when encoding consecutive addresses that access different sectors. Our proposed techniques have small power and delay overhead when compared with many of the existing methods in the literature. One of our proposed techniques is very suitable for encoding addresses that are sent from an on-chip cache to the main memory when multiple application programs are executing on the processor in a time-sharing basis. For a computer system without an on-chip cache, the proposed techniques decrease the switching activity of data address and multiplexed address buses by an average of 55 % and 67 %, respectively. For a system with on-chip cache, up to 55 % transition reduction is achieved on a multiplexed address bus between the internal cache and the external memory. Assuming a 10 pf per line bus capacitance, we show that power reduction of up to 52 % for an external data address bus and 42 % for the <b>multiplexed</b> <b>bus</b> between cache and main memory is achieved using our methods...|$|E
