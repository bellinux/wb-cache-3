It proved to be unsuitable for its designed purpose, due to its poor penetration and stopping power , and most went to target shooters and collectors. It had a fixed <b>match</b> <b>stock</b> with a rubber buttpad and an adjustable cheekpiece, folding bipod, flash hider, and a 6 × 42mm Leupold VIII Adjustable Objective scope.

50|$|M1903 NM (1921-1940): {{selected}} rifles {{produced at}} Springfield Armory for National Match shooting competition. Production barrels were measured with star-gauges, and those meeting specified tolerances were stamped with an asterisk shaped {{star on the}} muzzle crown. These barrels were fitted to selected receivers with hand-fitted and polished parts. The bolt was left unblued while the receiver and barrel were finished with a black Parkerizing process. Some bolts have the safety direction reversed {{to prevent it from}} striking the nose of a right-handed shooter, and those made from 1924 to 1929 have the knurled cocking piece removed to decrease lock time. Early rifles used the type S stock until the type C stock became standard in 1929. Rifles made for sale to NRA members (priced at $40.44) were drilled and tapped for a Lyman 48 receiver sight and had either a type B (or NB) stock with no grasping grooves and a noticeable drop at the heel for a long pistol grip, or a special National <b>Match</b> <b>stock</b> with a high comb and pistol grip.

40|$|We {{estimate}} the long-run stock performance after {{initial public offerings}} (IPOs) in the German capital market with a larger sample than prior studies and alternative benchmarks (the equally and the value-weighted market portfolio, size portfolios and <b>matching</b> <b>stocks).</b> In addition we present the first results on the long-run performance after seasoned equity issues (SEOs) in Germany. We conclude that size portfolios and <b>matching</b> <b>stocks</b> are better benchmarks than market portfolios. Using buy-and-hold abnormal returns, we estimate that German stocks involved in an IPO or in a SEO, on the average, underperform a portfolio consisting of stocks with a similar market capitalization by 6 % in three years. This is considerably less than the underperformance after IPOs and SEOs in the US market reported by Loughran/Ritter (1995) and the underperformance after IPOs in Germany reported by Ljungqvist (1997). We also show that the apparent underperformance of the 1988 - 1990 IPO cohort discussed by Ljungqvist (1997) disappears when the abnormal performance estimate is based on size instead of market portfolios.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{why some}} employers provide matching contributions to 401 (k) plans in company stock and explores {{the implications of}} match policy for employee retirement wealth. Unlike stock option grants to non-executives, a firm’s decision to <b>match</b> in company <b>stock</b> {{does not appear to}} be strongly correlated with cash flow or with measures of the benefits of aligning incentives of employees and employers. Rather, we find evidence that firms are more likely to provide the <b>match</b> in company <b>stock</b> if firm risk is low (i. e. lower stock price volatility and lower bankruptcy risk) and employees are also covered by a defined benefit plan. These findings suggest that firms consider the retirement security of their workers in making the match decision, either because firms want to minimize the risk of violating their fiduciary responsibility or because employees more fully value company stock at companies with lower firm-specific risk. Evidence also indicates that firms may want to <b>match</b> in company <b>stock</b> to boost employee ownership, perhaps to help deter takeovers, or because of the tax advantages for dividends on the company <b>stock</b> <b>match.</b> Simulation results suggest that sufficiently risk-tolerant individuals actually prefer a 401 (k) plan at a company with a company <b>stock</b> <b>match</b> to a plan at a company with an unrestricted match, unless the equity premium is reduced substantially...|$|R

We find that reassigned stocks have unusually wide spreads before reassignments and experience a decline in spreads to levels comparable to <b>matched</b> <b>stocks</b> after the reassignment. This improvement in liquidity is associated with a reduced cost of capital for the reassigned firms. We find that portfolio size, and industry and size concentration of the individual specialist portfolios are associated with the decision of specialist firms to reassign stocks. ...|$|R

S. stocks have wider spreads and larger adverse-selection costs than U. S. stocks even after controlling for macro-level institutional differences. Regression analysis shows that spreads and adverse-selection costs are negatively correlated with institutional ownership and analyst followings. Thus, the higher spreads and adverse-selection costs for non-U. S. stocks can be partly explained by the lower institutional ownership and analyst following of non-U. S. stocks. In addition, we find that although the spreads and adverse-selection costs for non-U. S. stocks are significantly higher before the implementation of Regulation Fair Disclosure (FD), the differences become even greater after Regulation FD, suggesting that Regulation FD has improved the information environment for U. S. stocks. 2005 The Southern Finance Association and the Southwestern Finance Association. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the effect of short-sale {{restrictions}} (SSR) with particular emphasis on their impact on the liquidity and informed trading in the stock and option markets. Design/methodology/approach: Using a panel regression with controls for volatility, VIX and <b>matched</b> <b>stocks,</b> this study examines the effect of the short-sale ban (SSB) on stock and option liquidity, expressed in terms of spread and volume. In addition, the PIN and option information share (OIS) measures have been used to analyze its impact on informed trading in those related markets. Findings: The results suggest that the SSB leads to a significant reduction in the liquidity of the affected stocks and their options. However, no significant change in the trader composition can be detected. This result is consistent to the short-prohibition effect predicted by Diamond and Verrecchia (1987). Research limitations/implications: Due to the sizeable data required to estimate the PIN and OIS measures, only a select sample of optionable stocks has been examined. Originality/value: This study offers both academics and policy makers some useful insights into the effect of SSR on trading activities in both stock and option markets. From a policy perspective, it clearly demonstrates that regulatory changes targeting a specific market also affect other related markets via the arbitrage link between them...|$|R
