The C-terminal end of folliculin has {{shown to be}} the domain through which it interacts with FNIP1, and thereby possibly the <b>mTOR</b> <b>pathway.</b> FLCN is highly conserved in vertebrates—it is very similar between many vertebrate species. The 508th amino acid, normally lysine, is affected by a missense mutation in some people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. The lysine at this position {{is found to be}} conserved between invertebrate and vertebrate orthologs of folliculin, indicating {{that it is important to}} the protein's function.|$|E
5|$|FLCN {{creates a}} protein called folliculin that has two isoforms. It appears {{to act as}} a tumor {{suppressor}} and is expressed strongly in the skin, distal nephrons, and type I pneumocytes. It has also been found in the parotid gland, brain, breast, pancreas, prostate, and ovaries. Tumor suppressors normally prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in the FLCN gene may interfere with the ability of folliculin to restrain cell growth and division, leading to the formation of noncancerous and cancerous tumors. Recent studies suggest that folliculin accomplishes this function through its involvement with cellular metabolism, possibly through modulation of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway and/or oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Folliculin interacts with FNIP1 and FNIP2 (FLCN-interacting protein) to form a complex with AMP-activated protein kinase. Folliculin's participation in the <b>mTOR</b> <b>pathway</b> may explain the similarity in phenotype between BHD syndrome, Cowden syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.|$|E

Specifically, the PI 3 K/Akt and <b>mTOR</b> <b>pathways</b> {{have been shown to}} play a pivotal role on the initiation and progression of malignancies, enhancing cell survival by stimulating cell proliferation, and inhibiting apoptosis. Therefore, it is critical to examine therapeutic agents that explicitly target both the PI 3 K/Akt and mTOR signaling cascades in diseases, such as Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (WM), that harbor activation of the PI 3 K/Akt pathway. We demonstrated that dual targeting of the PI 3 K and <b>mTOR</b> <b>pathways</b> by the novel inhibitor NVP-BEZ 235, exhibited toxicity on WM cells by directly targeting the tumor clone and indirectly through an effect on the bone marrow milieu.

40|$|AMP-activated {{protein kinase}} (AMPK) {{is a key}} energy-sensitive enzyme that {{controls}} numerous metabolic and cellular processes. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is another energy/nutrientsensitive kinase that controls protein synthesis and cell growth. In this study we determined whether older versus younger men have alterations in the AMPK and <b>mTOR</b> <b>pathways</b> in skeletal muscle, and examined {{the effect of a}} long term resistance type exercise training program on these signaling intermediaries. Older men had decreased AMPKa 2 activity and lower phosphorylation of AMPK and its downstream signaling substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). mTOR phosphylation also was reduced in muscle from older men.

5|$|The {{different}} {{manifestations of}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are controlled in different ways. The fibrofolliculomas {{can be removed}} surgically, through curettage, shave excision, skin resurfacing, or laser ablation; however, {{this is not a}} permanent solution as the tumors often recur. The renal and pulmonary symptoms are managed preventatively: CT scans, ultrasounds, or MRIs of the kidneys are recommended regularly, and family members are advised not to smoke. MRIs are the preferred method for surveillance of the kidneys in people with BHD because they do not carry the same risk of radiation complications as CT scans and are more sensitive than ultrasounds. Smokers with Birt–Hogg–Dubé have more severe pulmonary symptoms than non-smokers. Though nephrectomy is sometimes indicated, kidney tumors in cases of Birt–Hogg–Dubé are often removed without taking the whole kidney, in a procedure called partial nephrectomy. Knockout mouse studies have shown that administration of rapamycin may mitigate the effects of FLCN mutations on kidneys and improve renal cancer prognoses because of folliculin's interaction with the <b>mTOR</b> <b>pathway.</b>|$|E
5|$|People with Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} {{are born}} with one mutated copy of the FLCN gene in each cell. Haploinsufficiency—only having one functional copy of the FLCN gene—is enough to cause the fibrofolliculomas and pulmonary cysts, however, one copy of the gene is enough to keep kidney cells in check. During their lifetime, random mutations might inactivate the normal copy of the gene in a subset of cells. When this occurs, {{the result is that}} these cells have no functional copies of the FLCN gene, allowing the cells grow out of control. This loss of heterozygosity is a common mechanism in cancer, and it is frequently detected in the renal cancers associated with BHD. The molecular genetic defects in renal tumors of people with BHD are different from two other similar kidney tumors, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and renal oncocytoma. BHD-associated tumorigenesis differs between the kidney, where loss of FLCN heterozygosity is responsible for cancers, and the skin, where FLCN is strongly expressed in heterozygotes.

Inhibitors of MEK/ERK and <b>mTOR</b> <b>pathways</b> are tested as anticancer agents. They are generally considered to induce a G(1) cell cycle arrest through down-regulation of D-type cyclins and up-regulation of p 27 (kip 1). Here, we examined the effect of targeting mTOR by rapamycin and/or MEK by PD 184352 in human glioblastoma cell lines. In combination, these drugs cooperatively and potently inhibited the G(1) -S transition and retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation. Their cooperation could not be explained by their partial and differential inhibitory effects on cyclin D 1 or D 3 but instead by their synergistic inhibition of the activating T 172 phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4. This appeared independent of p 27 and unrelated to weak modulations of the CDK-activating kinase activity. The T 172 phosphorylation of CDK 4 thus appears as a crucial node integrating the activity of both MEK/ERK and <b>mTOR</b> <b>pathways.</b> Combined inhibition of both pathways {{should be considered as}} a promising strategy for treatment of tumors harboring a deregulated CDK 4 activity.

We determined the spinal {{effects of the}} rapamycin analogue cell cycle inhibitor (CCI) - 779 on neuronal responses and behavioral hypersensitivity in a model of persistent neuropathic pain. We also assessed the anatomical distribution of spinal <b>mTOR</b> signaling <b>pathways.</b> Specifically, we ligated rat spinal nerves L 5 and L 6 to produce a model of neuropathic pain. After confirming neuropathy with behavioral testing, we obtained in vivo single-unit extracellular stimulus-evoked recordings from deep dorsal horn spinal neurons. We applied CCI- 779 spinally in electrophysiological and behavioral studies and assessed its effects accordingly. We also used immunohistochemistry to probe for <b>mTOR</b> signaling <b>pathways</b> in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and the spinal cord. We found that spinally administered CCI- 779 rapidly attenuated calibrated mechanically but not thermally evoked neuronal responses and mechanically evoked behavioral responses.

40|$|Master of Science in Biomedical SciencesDepartment of Anatomy and PhysiologyYongming SangAnimal {{metabolic}} and {{immune systems}} integrate and inter-regulate to exert effective immune responses to distinct pathogens. The signaling pathway mediated by mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) {{is critical in}} cellular metabolism and implicated in host antiviral responses. Recent studies highlight {{the significance of the}} <b>mTOR</b> signaling <b>pathway</b> in the interferon (IFN) response. Type I IFNs mediate host defense, particularly, against viral infections, and have myriad roles in antiviral innate and adaptive immunity. In addition to their well-known antiviral properties, type I IFNs also affect host metabolism. However, little is known about how animal type I IFN signaling coordinates immunometabolic reactions during antiviral defense. Therefore, understanding the interaction of mTOR signaling and the type I IFN system becomes increasingly important in potentiating antiviral immunity. Tissue macrophages (MФs) are a primary IFN producer during viral infection, and their polarization to different activation statuses is critical for regulation of immune and metabolic homeostasis. Using porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) as a model, we found that genes in the <b>mTOR</b> signaling <b>pathway</b> were regulated differently in PRRSV-infected porcine alveolar MФs at different activation statuses. Therefore we hypothesize that: 1) the <b>mTOR</b> signaling <b>pathway</b> involves host anti-PRRSV regulation; 2) mTOR signaling interacts with IFN signaling to modulate the antiviral response; and 3) different type I IFN subtypes (such as IFN-α 1 and IFN-β) regulate mTOR signaling differently. We show that modulation of mTOR signaling regulated PRRSV infection in MARC- 145 cells and porcine primary cells, in part, through regulating production and signaling of type I IFNs. In addition, expression and phosphorylation of two key components in the <b>mTOR</b> signaling <b>pathway,</b> AKT and p 70 S 6 kinase, were regulated by type I IFNs and PRRSV infection. Taken together, we determined that the <b>mTOR</b> signaling <b>pathway,</b> a key pathway in regulation of cell metabolism, also mediates the type I IFN response, a key immune response in PRRSV infection. Our findings reveal that the <b>mTOR</b> signaling <b>pathway</b> potentially has a bi-directional loop with the type I IFN system and implies that some components in the <b>mTOR</b> signaling <b>pathway</b> can serve as targets for augmentation of antiviral immunity and therapeutic designs...|$|R

40|$|Summary. The {{mammalian}} {{target of}} rapamycin (mTOR) {{is a highly}} conserved serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates a number of diverse biologic processes important for cell growth and proliferation, including ribosomal biogenesis and protein translation. In this regard, hyperactivation of the <b>mTOR</b> signaling <b>pathway</b> has been demonstrated in numerous human cancers, including a number of inherited cancer syndromes in which individuals have {{an increased risk of}} developing benign and malignant tumors. Three of these inherited cancer syndromes (Lhermitte-Duclos disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, and tuberous sclerosis complex) are characterized by significant central nervous system dysfunction and brain tumor formation.
