[...] On Carey's official Facebook page on May 12, 2012, shortly after the release, she wrote, [...] "I spent four years writing this song, only because after I performed in Schenectady, NY, I started hearing this melody and singing {{it over and over}} to <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was taking a bath, looking at the moon.. Four years later, as I was leaving a devastating part of my life behind, I wrote the second verse, the bridge and the outro." ...|$|E
500|$|Tracy disliked when he {{was asked}} about his technique, or about what advice he would give to others. He often belittled the profession, for {{instance}} saying to Kanin, [...] "Why do actors think they're so God damn important? They're not. Acting is not an important job in the scheme of things. Plumbing is." [...] Tracy was humble about his abilities, telling a journalist, [...] "it's just that I try no tricks. No profile. No 'great lover' act... I just project <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am—plain, trying to be honest." [...] He was known to have enjoyed the quip once made by Alfred Lunt: [...] "The art of acting is—learn your lines!" [...] Katharine Hepburn, in an interview six years after Tracy's death, suggested that Tracy wished he had held a different profession.|$|E
2500|$|Beat Takeshi told a {{documentary}} crew during filming {{that he believes}} [...] "an actor's job is to satisfy the director... I move the way I'm told to. I try to look the way I'm told to. I don't {{know much about the}} emotional side", before adding, [...] "Mr. Fukasaku told me to play myself. I did not really understand, but he told me to play <b>myself,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> ordinarily would be! I'm just trying to do what he tells me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Melba's first {{recordings}} {{were made}} around 1895, recorded on cylinders at the Bettini Phonograph Lab in New York. A reporter from Phonoscope magazine was impressed: [...] "The next cylinder was labelled 'Melba' and was truly wonderful, the phonograph reproducing her wonderful voice in a marvellous manner, especially the high notes which soared away above {{the staff and}} were rich and clear." [...] Melba was less impressed: [...] "'Never again,' I said to <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> listened to the scratching, screeching result. 'Don't tell me I sing like that, or I shall go away and live on a desert island.'" [...] The recordings never reached the general public– destroyed on Melba's orders, it is suspected– and Melba would not venture into a recording studio for another eight years. Melba can be heard singing on several Mapleson Cylinders, early attempts at live recording, made by the Metropolitan Opera House librarian Lionel Mapleson in the auditorium there during performances. These cylinders are often poor in quality, but they preserve something {{of the quality of}} the young Melba's voice and performance that is sometimes lacking from her commercial recordings.|$|E

If you will be so good as to favour me with your attention for a couple of minutes, miss, not more, I'll endeavour to explain <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> clearly <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can." ...|$|R
