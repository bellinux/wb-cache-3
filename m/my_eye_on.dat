500|$|In the lyrics, Spears {{lets the}} subject {{know he is}} on her radar, while she lists the qualities the man has. Kimberly Chou said Spears' {{delivery}} [...] " [...] so aggressive it's almost threatening." [...] Spears sings lyrics such as [...] "Confidence is a must / cockiness is a plus / edginess is a rush / edges I like 'em rough / A man with a Midas touch / Intoxicate me I'm a lush." [...] During the bridge she sings [...] "I got <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> you / And I can't let you get away", making clear her attraction.|$|E
500|$|While {{performing}} {{shows with}} The Second City in 1997, Fey submitted several scripts to NBC's variety show Saturday Night Live (SNL), {{at the request}} of its head writer Adam McKay, a former performer at Second City. She was hired as a writer for SNL following a meeting with SNL creator Lorne Michaels, and moved to New York from Chicago. Fey told The New Yorker, [...] "I'd had <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> the show forever, the way other kids have their eye on Derek Jeter." [...] Originally, Fey [...] "struggled" [...] at SNL. Her first sketch to air starred Chris Farley in a Sally Jessy Raphael satire. Fey went on to write a series of parodies, including one of ABC's morning talk show The View. She co-wrote the [...] "Sully and Denise" [...] sketches with Rachel Dratch, who plays one of the teens.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{arriving}} at a polo mansion. She comes out from the car wearing a vest, jeans and showing her midriff. She starts singing while her boyfriend welcomes her. They walk past a barn, where a polo player is sitting. They {{look at each other}} briefly and she starts to sing in a balcony, watching the second man with a pair of binoculars. At {{the end of the first}} chorus, her boyfriend comes and puts a studded necklace around her neck, as a surprise gift. Until the end of the second chorus, we see scenes of Spears singing and watching the polo player as he gets ready. When the bridge begins, Spears arrives at a match wearing a white dress and a large hat. She looks at the polo player over her shoulder and sings the lines [...] "I got <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> you / And I can’t let you get away". When the match ends, she leaves and the second man follows her. They flirt inside a hallway and leave. Her boyfriend notices her absence, walks into the hallway and sees her necklace on the floor. The video ends with Spears and the second man walking into the sunset.|$|E

500|$|From {{the early}} 1920s Poulenc was well {{received}} abroad, particularly in Britain, {{both as a}} performer and a composer. In 1921 Ernest Newman wrote in The Manchester Guardian, [...] "I keep <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> Francis Poulenc, {{a young man who}} has only just arrived at his twenties. He ought to develop into a farceur of the first order." [...] Newman said that he had rarely heard anything so deliciously absurd as parts of Poulenc's song cycle Cocardes, with its accompaniment played by the unorthodox combination of cornet, trombone, violin and percussion. In 1922 Poulenc and Milhaud travelled to Vienna to meet Alban Berg, Anton Webern and Arnold Schönberg. Neither of the French composers was influenced by their Austrian colleagues' revolutionary twelve-tone system, but they admired the three as its leading proponents. The following year Poulenc received a commission from Serge Diaghilev for a full-length ballet score. He decided that the theme would be a modern version of the classical French fête galante. This work, Les biches, was an immediate success, first in Monte Carlo in January 1924 and then in Paris in May, under the direction of André Messager; it has remained one of Poulenc's best-known scores. Poulenc's new celebrity after the success of the ballet was the unexpected cause of his estrangement from Satie: among the new friends Poulenc made was Louis Laloy, a writer whom Satie regarded with implacable enmity. Auric, who had just enjoyed a similar triumph with a Diaghilev ballet, Les Fâcheux, was also repudiated by Satie for becoming a friend of Laloy.|$|E
2500|$|Paulie (Raskopoulos), a {{young man}} of unknown Mediterranean heritage, dressed in a green-and-pink striped polo shirt, confronts various people to {{complain}} about what might be termed pedantic issues. For example, in his first appearance, he explains to a cashier at a store that gnocchi is actually made of potatoes, {{and should not be}} placed in the pasta aisle. Other complaints he made included wanting to change the nickname of the Australian soccer team because a [...] "socceroo" [...] isn't a real animal, and that George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four is [...] "incorrect" [...] because its events did not occur in 1984. [...] In a more recent episode, Paulie confronts the owner of an Adult Sex shop telling him that the [...] "edible undies" [...] should have a nutritional value printed on the box, just in case a vegan is starving to death and needs to know that there is no beef in them. At the end of each sketch Paulie recommends that the problem be solved by putting a sticker on the offending object, and assures the target of his complaint that [...] "I've got <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> youse". Perhaps to prove a point, the scenarios are often shown later on in the episode.|$|E
2500|$|Ullman {{contends that}} her impersonations are played with great admiration and affection. [...] "I hope {{they take it}} in the right spirit!" [...] One person {{impersonated}} who's reacted positively to her portrayal as a kleptomaniac Dame who wreaks havoc on an unsuspecting public is actress Judi Dench. Dench's daughter, Finty Williams, posted a clip of Ullman playing her mother on Facebook with the caption, [...] "brilliant, just brilliant." [...] Critics also praised the impersonation, with one writer saying: [...] "Her impersonation of Dench is so spot on that, {{for a second or}} two, you can't be sure she is not the real deal. Her performance easily transcends the make-up thanks to her mastery of posture, gesture and facial control as well as pitch- perfect vocals." [...] While filming on location, on-lookers asked if they were filming a James Bond film after catching Ullman in character. At the 36th London Critics' Circle Film Awards, Judi Dench introduced herself as [...] "Tracey Ullman." [...] In April 2017, while speaking to BBC Radio 4's Front Row, Dench commented on Ullman's portrayal, saying that she doted on it, and dubbed Ullman as brilliant. [...] "But I get into trouble now if I go into a shop with a bag over my arm [...] A man came up to me in M the other day and said to me, 'I've got <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> you'." ...|$|E
