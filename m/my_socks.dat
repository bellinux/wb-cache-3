500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an 'A', saying [...] "Community is going {{away for a}} while, but it's going away with an episode that reminds me why I love the show so much. This is a very {{personal}} thing—since humor's subjective like that—but for me, this was the funniest episode since the clip show... I laughed myself silly at this one, {{to the point where}} I was devolving into hiccups at certain scenes, and I'm glad we get to go out on an episode like this, one that plays around with form and makes me laugh." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix also praised the Glee-spoofing, saying [...] "'Regional Holiday Music' was the logical, clever, funny endpoint to it." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said, [...] "As with its best theme-episodes, the show bridged the gap between high-concept parody and character-based comedy." [...] TV Fanatic's Leigh Raines gave the episode a 4/5 rating, saying while the show [...] "definitely went out with a bang, it didn't totally blow <b>my</b> <b>socks</b> off... While there were a few moments that upped the ick factor, overall this episode fell on the positive side." [...] She praised Troy and Abed's rap performance, but called the scene where Annie seduces Jeff [...] "creepy". Robert Canning of IGN said it was a [...] "great" [...] episode, but [...] "faltered just a bit" [...] at the end: [...] "Abed's realization that his attempts to brighten the holiday only made things darker, as Jeff had previously suggested, fit the character well enough, but the study group's follow-up felt a bit forced and holiday hokey. Of course, that could well have been the point." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{have claimed}} that the sound of [...] "That's Alright" [...] was not entirely new, [...] "It wasn't that they said 'I never heard {{anything}} like it before.' It wasn't as if this started a revolution, it galvanized a revolution. Not because Elvis had expressed something new, but he expressed something {{they had all been}} trying to express." [...] Sam Phillips indicated that for him it was a new sound, saying [...] "It just broke me up". And many echo the sentiment that it was a sound like no other they had heard: [...] "When I first heard Elvis singing 'That's Alright Mama'. The time just stood still. It knocked <b>my</b> <b>socks</b> off." [...] --Ramon Maupin.|$|E

60|$|I thought so: I {{am always}} wrong. All <b>my</b> best <b>socks</b> have yellow spots. I rather fancied them. They were expensive, too, now I {{come to think}} of it.|$|R

60|$|On {{the morning}} after our being trapped upon the plateau by the villainous Gomez we began a new stage in our experiences. The first {{incident}} in it was not such as {{to give me a}} very favorable opinion of the place to which we had wandered. As I roused myself from a short nap after day had dawned, my eyes fell upon a most singular appearance upon my own leg. My trouser had slipped up, exposing a few inches of my skin above <b>my</b> <b>sock.</b> On this there rested a large, purplish grape. Astonished at the sight, I leaned forward to pick it off, when, to my horror, it burst between my finger and thumb, squirting blood in every direction. My cry of disgust had brought the two professors to my side.|$|R

Please to {{make all}} <b>my</b> <b>socks</b> with a hitch like that in them all round, just above the ankle. It will form an {{ornamental}} ring.

6000|$|I {{immediately}} {{turned to}} my work, and was gratified to find that all my things were laid out ready for dressing; my portmanteau had of course come open, as my keys were in my pocket, and therefore some of the excellent servants of {{the house had been}} able to save me all the trouble of unpacking. There was my shirt hanging before the fire; my black clothes were spread upon the bed, <b>my</b> <b>socks</b> and collar and handkerchief beside them; my brushes were on the toilet table, and everything prepared exactly as though my own man had been there. How nice! ...|$|E

40|$|The sock-drawer problem {{seemed to}} {{be a good place to}} start when {{thinking}} about size (or numbers), especially on cold, dark, winter mornings. When we think about size (or num-bers) in the sock drawer or any other context, the numbers we need to answer a question depend on the precise ques-tion asked. Socks can help us get our brains around it (and help us look clever at dinner parties). The scenario We have 20 pairs of socks: 10 pairs of red socks (20 red socks in total) and 10 pairs of white socks (20 white socks in to-tal). The problem is that they are all mixed up in <b>my</b> <b>sock</b> drawer, and it is dark, so I can’t see the colour of the socks I am taking out of the drawer. We can ask a number of subtly different questions. Q 1 : How many socks do I have to take out to be sure tha...|$|R

"I am satisfied, for he's {{done what}} I hoped he would; and he's none the less a gentleman because he's a private and wears <b>my</b> <b>socks.</b> I pray {{they will keep}} him safe, and bring him home to us when he has done his duty like a man, as I know he will. I'm proud of my brave substitute, and I'll try to be worthy of him," [...] cried Belle, {{kindling}} beautifully as she looked out into the wintry sunshine with a new softness in the eyes that still seemed watching that blue-coated figure marching away to danger, perhaps death.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think, unfortunately, of a {{great many}} other things. Hashed mutton is simply symbolical. Under the head of hashed mutton I include poor lodgings, growlers when we get {{ourselves}} asked to eat a dinner at somebody's table, limited washing-bills, table-napkins rolled up in their dirt {{every day for a}} week, antimacassars to save the backs of the chairs, a picture of you darning <b>my</b> <b>socks</b> while I am reading a newspaper hired at a halfpenny from the public-house round the corner, a pint of beer in the pewter between us,--and perhaps two babies in one cradle because we can't afford to buy a second." ...|$|E

6000|$|She begged {{permission}} to remain, {{and promised to}} turn her back, and so on, but I was obdurate, and she then delivered herself of a passionately affectionate farewell to her charge, which was really all directed against me, and ended with these powerful words: [...] "And if he takes off your <b>socks,</b> <b>my</b> pretty, may he be blasted for evermore." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Three quid a {{week from}} me, and the delights of <b>my</b> society. No <b>socks</b> mended. Nothing from Torp except a nod on the landing now and again, and all his socks mended.

60|$|The thing {{really began}} when I {{got back to}} Easeby, my uncle's place in Shropshire. I was {{spending}} {{a week or so}} there, as I generally did in the summer; and I had had to break my visit to come back to London to get a new valet. I had found Meadowes, the fellow I had taken to Easeby with me, sneaking <b>my</b> silk <b>socks,</b> a thing no bloke of spirit could stick at any price. It transpiring, moreover, that he had looted {{a lot of other things}} here and there about the place, I was reluctantly compelled to hand the misguided blighter the mitten and go to London to ask the registry office to dig up another specimen for my approval. They sent me Jeeves.|$|R
60|$|Thus it {{is obvious}} what were my {{qualifications}} when I was rashly engaged as a leader-writer (it was my sister who saw the advertisement) on an English provincial paper. At the moment I was as uplifted as the others, for the chance had come at last, with what we all regarded as a prodigious salary, but I was wanted {{in the beginning of}} the week, and it suddenly struck me that the leaders were the one thing I had always skipped. Leaders! How were they written? what were they about? My mother was already sitting triumphant among <b>my</b> <b>socks,</b> and I durst not let her see me quaking. I retired to ponder, and presently she came to me with the daily paper. Which were the leaders? she wanted to know, so evidently I could get no help from her. Had she any more newspapers? I asked, and after rummaging, she produced a few with which her boxes had been lined. Others, very dusty, came from beneath carpets, and lastly a sooty bundle was dragged down the chimney. Surrounded by these I sat down, and studied how to become a journalist.|$|E
60|$|It was an {{expedition}} getting there. This arose, not from any special fault in the path, {{which for the}} first half of the way consisted of a string of stepping-stones neatly laid in the ground, and for the latter fraction of no worse mud than could easily be met with elsewhere. The trouble came from a misunderstanding in foot-gear. It seemed too short a walk to put one's boots twice on and off for the doing of it. On the other hand, to walk in stocking-feet was out of the question, for the mud. So I attempted a compromise, consisting of <b>my</b> <b>socks</b> and the native wooden clogs, and tried to make the one take kindly to the other. But my mittenlike socks would have none of my thongs, and, failing of a grip for my toes, compelled me to scuffle along in a very undignified way. Then every few steps one or the other of the clogs saw fit to stay behind, and I had to halt to recover the delinquent. I made a sorry spectacle as I screwed about on the remaining shoe, groping after its fellow. Once I was caught in the act by my cicerone, who turned round inopportunely to see why I was not following; and twice in attempting the feat I all but lost my balance into the mud.|$|E
60|$|Then Penfentenyou, venal and {{adaptable}} politician of {{the type}} that survives {{at the price of}} all the higher emotions, appeared at the window of the house on my right, broken and congested with mirth, the woman beside him, and the child in his arms. I saw his mouth open and shut, he hollowed his hands round it, but the churr of the motor and the bees drowned his words. He pointed dramatically across the street many times and fell back, tears running down his face. I turned like a hooded barbette in a heavy seaway (not knowing when my trousers would come out of <b>my</b> <b>socks</b> again) through one hundred and eighty degrees, and in due time bore on the village green. There was a salmon in the pond, rising short at a cloud of midges to the tune of Yip-i-addy; but there was none to gaff him. The swing-boats were empty, cocoa-nuts sat still on their red sticks before white screens, and the gay-painted horses of the giddy-go-rounds revolved riderless. All was melody, green turf, bright water, and this greedy gambolling fish. When I had identified it by its grey gills and binoculars as Lingnam, I prostrated myself before Allah in that mirth which is more truly labour than any prayer. Then I turned to the purple Penfentenyou at the window, and wiped my eyes on the rug edge.|$|E

Michael McKeegan, Gerry & Susan our management team and Polly at Blast have really worked hard {{on a daily basis}} to get it out {{before the end of the}} year.Most of the unreleased material had been in various band members cupboards and storage unheard since they were recorded and dusted down for the collection. There's a ton of material there which we hope you'll all love.'Dark Naughty Steps' is a fave of mine that I wanted to be on ABCOL, 'All Low No High' should have been a single but didn't even make it on an album. The re-work of 'Animal Bones' has some sublime bass playing from Mr McKeegan and the drum pattern of 'Glamour of Potential' is Meester Cooper, The Derby Demon, at his finest. Speaking of drum patterns there's a classic one from Fyfe on ‘Mind Body Soul’ which was a constant in our live sets pre-'Babyteeth'. Watch out too for lots of lovely unheard cello playing from Martin McCarrick.Most of the photographs in the booklet are from our private collections, taken on Polaroids and cheap cameras in various countries in the world over all of our career. From hotel rooms, tour buses and plain old sightseeing, there's candid shots aplenty and a few wee celebrities chucked in there too.You might not want to know this but the 'Live At The White Horse' tape languished at the back of <b>my</b> <b>sock</b> drawer for years hidden inside a felt bag.

Father was busy with his team drawing off wheat and hogs and hay, and often came into the house at night, white with the storms through which he had passed. My trips to school were often interrupted by the cold, and the path which my sister and I trod was along the ever-deepening furrows made by the bob-sleighs of the farmers.
