30|$|This paper {{performs}} a cross-country level {{analysis on the}} impact of the level of specific youth <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> on the labor market performance of young individuals. We use information on the use and level of youth <b>minimum</b> <b>wages,</b> as compared to the level of adult <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> {{as well as to the}} median wage (i.e., the Kaitz index). We complement these data with variables on the employment, labor force participation, and unemployment rates of 5 -year age interval categories—all derived from the official OECD database. We distinguish between countries without <b>minimum</b> <b>wages,</b> countries with uniform <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> for all age groups, and countries with separate youth and adult <b>minimum</b> <b>wages.</b> Our results indicate that the relative employment rates of young individuals below the age of 25 —as compared to the older workers—in countries with youth <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> are close to those in countries without <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> at all. Turning to the smaller sample of countries with <b>minimum</b> <b>wages,</b> increases in the level of (youth) <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> exert a substantial negative impact on the employment rate for young individuals.|$|R

30|$|Results {{reveal that}} in general, the {{association}} between <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> and firms’ actual wages, for both production workers and non-production workers, is robust and significant. For production workers, a 10 percent increase in real <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> {{is associated with a}} 1.8 percent increase in wages in small firms, but only 0.8 percent increase in wages in large firms. For non-production workers, a 10 percent increase in real <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> is associated with a 1.65 percent increase in wages in small firms, but only 1.2 percent in larger firms. The association between <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> and actual wages is significant, of large magnitude in small firms, but less so in larger firms. This suggests that wages in small firms are more sensitive to changes in <b>minimum</b> <b>wages,</b> which is consistent with the fact that on average, wages in small firms are significantly lower. In other words, small firms are more likely to raise their wages in response to an increase in <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> because their wages are more binding.|$|R
