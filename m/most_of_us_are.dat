500|$|Nevertheless, {{like many}} other U.S. media sources, the Times had {{suffered}} from a decline in public perceptions of credibility in the U.S. from 2004 to 2012. A Pew Research Center survey in 2012 asked respondents about their views on credibility of various news organizations. Among respondents who gave a rating, 49% said that they believed [...] "all or most" [...] of the [...] Timess reporting, while 50% disagreed. A large percentage (19%) of respondents were unable to rate believability. The Timess score was {{comparable to that of}} USA Today. Media analyst Brooke Gladstone of WNYC's On the Media, writing for The New York Times, says that the decline in U.S. public trust of the mass media can be explained (1) by the rise of the polarized Internet-driven news; (2) by a decline in trust in U.S. institutions more generally; and (3) by the fact that [...] "Americans say they want accuracy and impartiality, but the polls suggest that, actually, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> seeking affirmation." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} one of the few in the series that has no paranormal {{elements}} to it. Carter said of the episode's conception, [...] "My first chance to work with David Nutter in a long time, and I wanted to give him something he could sink his teeth into. It's a little bit different for us. It doesn't really have a paranormal aspect, except for Scully's perceptions of her deepest fears. I felt that I had to figure out what she is most afraid of, and she is most afraid of those things that <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> afraid of. [...] The idea of dying at the hands of someone—creature or not—and she is helpless to do anything about it. I thought it was a very good way to explore Scully's character." [...] The scene where Dana Scully imagines Pfaster appearing as a devil was influenced by real-life accounts, as described by Carter: [...] "There are reports of people who had been under the spell of Jeffrey Dahmer, who actually claimed that he shape-shifted during those hours when they were held hostage; that his image actually changed." [...] Nutter said [...] "In many ways, Chris wanted to sell the idea that, as established in Mulder's closing dialogue in the show, not all terror comes from the paranormal. It could come from the person next door." ...|$|E

I've realized as I've gotten older that we all think we're living either in a black or white world, or on a straight path, but <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> living right in between those straight lines. And everything you thought you knew, the older you get, you realize, 'Damn, I don't know nothing about this. I better pay attention, I better listen and keep learning.' So I think that, that's what I've been realizing these past few years." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ayaan Hirsi Ali {{called on}} Western leaders {{to wake up}} to the reality of the situation. She stated [...] "For the {{majority}} of Muslims in the world the Holocaust is not a major historical event they deny; they simply do not know because they were never informed. Worse, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> groomed to wish for a Holocaust of Jews." [...] She says that she never learned anything about the Holocaust while she was studying in Saudi Arabia and Kenya. She called for action from charities: [...] "Western and Christian charities in the third world should take it upon themselves to inform Muslims and non-Muslims alike, in the areas where they are active, about the Holocaust." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} Diana Fuss (1991) explains, [...] "the {{problem of}} {{course with the}} inside/outside rhetoric...is that such polemics disguise the fact that <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> {{both inside and outside}} at the same time". Further, [...] "To be out, in common gay parlance, is precisely to be no longer out; to be out is to be finally outside of exteriority and all the exclusions and deprivations such outsiderhood imposes. Or, put another way, to be out is really to be in—inside the realm of the visible, the speakable, the culturally intelligible." [...] In other words, coming out constructs the closet it supposedly destroys and the self it supposedly reveals, [...] "the first appearance of the homosexual as a 'species' rather than a 'temporary aberration' also marks the moment of the homosexual's disappearance—into the closet".|$|E
2500|$|When {{coming out}} is {{described}} as a gradual process or a journey, it is meant to include becoming aware of and acknowledging one's same-sex desires or gender identity. This preliminary stage, which involves soul-searching or a personal epiphany, is often called [...] "coming out to oneself" [...] and constitutes the start of self-acceptance. Many LGBT people say that this stage began for them during adolescence or childhood, when they first became aware of their sexual orientation toward members of the same sex. Coming out has also been described as a process because of a recurring need or desire to come out in new situations in which LGBT people are assumed to be heterosexual or cisgender, such as at a new job or with new acquaintances. As Diana Fuss (1991) explains, [...] "the problem of course with the inside/outside rhetoric...is that such polemics disguise the fact that <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> both inside and outside at the same time".|$|E

2500|$|Merengue típico {{songs are}} {{generally}} composed in two parts. The first section is rhythmically straightforward {{and is used}} to introduce the song's melodic and lyrical material; here, verses are sung and the only improvisation heard occurs {{at the end of}} song lines, when the accordion or saxophone fills in. The second section is dominated by improvisation, more complex rhythms, and hard-driving mambo, or the part of the song where melody instruments (sax and accordion) unite to play catchy, syncopated riffs or jaleos which help motivate and stimulate dancers. Típico rhythms include merengue derecho, or straight-ahead merengue, which is the kind of fast-paced [...] time merengue <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> used to hearing, usually used in the first section. Pambiche or merengue apambichao is similar but usually slower, and can be recognized by the double slap rhythm on the tambora. Guinchao is a third rhythm combining the first two that is commonly heard in the second section of a merengue. Típico groups do not have to limit themselves to merengue as they can also play other traditional rhythms from the Dominican Republic and elsewhere, though this was more common in the past than at present. Mangulina and guaracha are now seldom heard; the latter is a clave-based style in [...] originally from Cuba, while the former is a [...] dance native to the DR. Paseo was a slow introduction to a merengue song during which couples would promenade around the dance floor in stately fashion. Orquesta or big band merengue became the merengue of choice for the urban Dominican middle and upper classes in the twentieth century. Although merengue had been played in upper class salons as early as the 1850s, moralists like then-president Ulises Espaillat succeeded in banning the dance from such locations only two decades later, causing the merengue to effectively die out in the cities. Still, it was kept alive by rural musicians such as accordionist/composer Nico Lora, and it began to reappear in towns of the Cibao during the 1910s.|$|E
