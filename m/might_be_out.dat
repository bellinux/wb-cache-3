500|$|American {{pop culture}} critic Chuck Klosterman later cited Spin Alternative Record Guide {{as one of}} his five {{favorite}} books, saying in 2011, [...] "I fear this <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> of print, but it's probably my favorite music book of all time. Since its 1995 publication, I doubt a year has passed when I didn't reread at least part of it." [...] Robert Christgau, who contributed to the book, wrote that while most music guides and encyclopedia books he has consulted were unremarkable, Spin Alternative Record Guide {{was one of the few}} [...] "useful exceptions" [...] because of what he felt was the [...] "sharpest writing" [...] from contributors such as Weisbard and Sheffield. Maura Johnston, on the other hand, said in retrospect that the book's list of the 100 best albums catered to [...] "hipper, Gen-Xier tastes".|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of April 18, Gage ordered a mounted patrol of about 20 men {{under the command of}} Major Mitchell of the 5th Regiment of Foot into the {{surrounding}} country to intercept messengers who <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> on horseback. [...] This patrol behaved differently from patrols sent out from Boston in the past, staying out after dark and asking travelers about the location of Samuel Adams and John Hancock. This had the unintended effect of alarming many residents and increasing their preparedness. [...] The Lexington militia in particular began to muster early that evening, hours before receiving any word from Boston. [...] A well-known story alleges that after nightfall one farmer, Josiah Nelson, mistook the British patrol for the colonists and asked them, [...] "Have you heard anything about when the regulars are coming out?" [...] upon which he was slashed on his scalp with a sword. However, the story of this incident was not published until over a century later, which suggests that it may be little more than a family myth.|$|E
500|$|The {{first part}} of the finale {{received}} critical acclaim. Ramsey Isler of IGN thought it [...] "fantastic," [...] because it was [...] "a great story that leads us into one hell of a conclusion to the season," [...] and that it [...] "right away [...] us the deepest, most exciting look into the alternate universe we've seen so far." [...] He rated it 9.0/10. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly and MTV's Josh Wigler agreed on this last point, with Tucker noting the first part [...] "was a complete success and a blast at giving us a fully lived-in alternate universe." [...] Noel Murray of The Onions The A.V. Club graded the first part with an A−, calling it [...] "a fun, exciting episode that nicely set up next week's finale". Isler, Wigler, and Murray loved the return of the Cortexifan subjects; Murray docked the episode a half point, explaining [...] "I love the idea of Olivia & The Cortexifanatics so much that I'm bummed Fringe burned through the group so quickly." [...] Critic Andrew Hanson, writing for the Los Angeles Times, noted that because of the parallel universe focus, the first part felt like the following season's premiere. He praised the opening scene, and believed the scenes between Peter and his mother helped [...] "ground the episode. They <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> of pace with the action and drama pouring out of every other moment, but there was weight and emotion. Bravo Joshua Jackson and Orla Brady. Bravo." [...] Ken Tucker noted that the scenes with Peter and his true mother indicated [...] "a great, humantistic use of a sci-fi trope". MTV's Josh Wigler praised Torv's performance, but wished the two-part finale was not broken up, explaining [...] "I could have easily tuned in for another several hours. Heck, I could watch an entire parallel series focused solely on the alternate universe!" ...|$|E

500|$|The three coinage bills—Maine Centennial, Alabama Centennial, and Pilgrim Tercentenary—were {{considered}} {{in that order}} by the House of Representatives on April 21, 1920. As the Maine and Alabama pieces were considered, Ohio's Warren Gard asked {{a number of questions}} about various matters, including regarding the wisdom of having so many half dollar designs issued, though he did not object to the passage of either bill. After the Pilgrim bill came to the floor, Gard asked Walsh why the bill provided for 500,000 half dollars, so much more than for the state coins; Walsh responded that it was because the coin was for a 300th anniversary rather than just a 100th. [...] Gard followed up this point, asking {{if it had been a}} 400th anniversary, whether even more coins would be justified, and Walsh agreed. Both Walsh and Vestal were asked by Gard how many half dollars were in circulation, but neither legislator knew. Washington Representative John Franklin Miller asked whether the coin was to commemorate the original landing of the Pilgrims at Provincetown or their subsequent landing at Plymouth, but Walsh did not answer the question definitively. Congressman James W. Dunbar of Indiana noted that the price of silver had risen so high that the Mint <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> of pocket in striking the coins, and asked if the federal government would cover any losses; Vestal responded that Massachusetts would. Vestal then moved the committee amendment to reduce the authorized mintage from 500,000 to 300,000, attracting the attention of Gard, who asked the reason for the change and was told the original bill had a typographical error. Walsh had told the committee that he had selected the figure of 500,000 since the Pilgrim anniversary was more important than the Maine state centennial. Gard enquired if the amendment had been approved by the committee, and when he was told it had, asked if the Pilgrim half dollars would buy more than ordinary half dollars to which Walsh replied, [...] "why, I think very likely, especially on Cape Cod." [...] Gard indicated his hope that he could spend a few days there that summer, and Vestal stated that Gard would be welcome to obtain and spend half dollars in any of the three states celebrating anniversaries. The bill passed the House without recorded opposition.|$|E
2500|$|Howard {{had back}} surgery earlier in April, and the Lakers had {{acquired}} {{him with the}} possibility that he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> [...] until December or January. He did not play basketball until training camp in October. The Lakers went a winless 0–8 in the preseason with Howard playing in just two of the games while he was still recovering. Brown estimated it could take until January for the Lakers to fully master the new offense. The Lakers starting lineup {{at the start of the}} regular season was both the league's tallest and its oldest with Nash (38 years old), Bryant (34), Gasol and World Peace (32), and Howard (26). The five All-Stars had a combined 33 All-Star appearances, and the team had the league's highest payroll at just over $100 million. The New York Times called them [...] "one of the most talented lineups in NBA history." [...] ESPN wrote that the Lakers were [...] "not only expected to win the title but to do so in record-breaking fashion." [...] Bryant cautioned that they were not [...] "the most athletic team in the world" [...] and could be limited in their rebounding and transition game. Howard was ready for the start of the season, but he was still recovering from his back surgery. In his Laker debut, Howard had 19points and 10rebounds, but he was only 3-for-14 on free throws and fouled out; the Lakers lost 99–91.|$|E
