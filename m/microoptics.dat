Development of miniaturized fluorescence detection devices will enable the construction of fully integrated platforms for clinical diagnostics. This dissertation reports the conceptual design, fabrication implementation, and experimental application of a piezoelectrically tunable Microoptoelectromechanical System (MOEMS) device as the central system for a combined spectral/time-resolved fluorescence biosensor for tissue characterization. From design point of view, this dissertation examined the theoretical characteristics using a piezoelectric multimorph model with the appropriate diffraction geometry and evaluated the ray tracing geometries to estimate the system spectroscopic performance. To realize the MOEMS device, the fabrication was divided into three main parts: 1) Piezoelectrically actuated grating, 2) <b>microoptics</b> for light coupling, and 3) a three-dimensional aligned packaging. The micrograting actuator was fabricated via bulk-micromachining process with a ZnO thin-film sandwich to provide linear actuation with input voltage. Its performance is characterized by measured frequency response and linearity of actuation as well as the optical efficiency of its lithographically patterned grating. As the center of the <b>microoptics,</b> the microlens diaphragm is built via a polymer molding technique and is characterized with a novel setup based on Gaussian beam propagation technique.
