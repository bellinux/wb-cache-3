5|$|Until {{the twentieth}} century, access to Padstow's harbour was via a narrow channel between the Doom Bar and the cliffs at Stepper Point, a {{difficult}} passage for sailing ships to navigate especially in north-westerly gales when the cliffs would {{cut off the}} wind. Many ships were wrecked on the Doom Bar, despite the installation of mooring rings and capstans on the cliffs and quarrying away part of Stepper Point to improve the wind. In {{the early twentieth century}} the main channel moved away from the cliffs, and continued dredging has made it <b>much</b> <b>safer</b> for boats, but deaths have occurred on the bar as recently as 1997.|$|E
5|$|Although benzodiazepines are <b>much</b> <b>safer</b> in {{overdose}} {{than their}} predecessors, the barbiturates, {{they can still}} cause problems in overdose. Taken alone, they rarely cause severe complications in overdose; statistics in England showed that benzodiazepines were responsible for 3.8% of all deaths by poisoning from a single drug. However, combining these drugs with alcohol, opiates or tricyclic antidepressants markedly raises the toxicity. The elderly are {{more sensitive to the}} side effects of benzodiazepines, and poisoning may even occur from their long-term use. The various benzodiazepines differ in their toxicity; temazepam appears most toxic in overdose and when used with other drugs. The symptoms of a benzodiazepine overdose may include; drowsiness, slurred speech, nystagmus, hypotension, ataxia, coma, respiratory depression, and cardiorespiratory arrest.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop the {{evaluation}} system of which the city safety can be realized in the U-City. The evaluation system on "how <b>much</b> <b>safe</b> the present city is " and "how <b>much</b> <b>safe</b> it will be in the future " has been selected and the criticality has also been analyzed. The result of criticality analysis is that the indicator for "how safe the current city is " showed that the disaster prevention and environmental field are important. In the future, the indicator of possibility for the U-safe city should be prepared by the imtegrative operation management system, and on the basis of this, it also showed that the necessary indicator to build the system for keeping the safe city is important. The evaluation system for the U-safe city, hereafter, can be utilized for the city plan, construction, operation, and management utilized by IT in local government...|$|R

Ramsay MacDonald became the first Labour Prime Minister, but the Labour government fell within months, necessitating another general election. By a margin of only 77 votes, Chamberlain narrowly defeated Labour candidate Oswald Mosley (who later led the British Union of Fascists).

5|$|Informed of the King's decision, Le Gris {{contacted}} Jean Le Coq, {{widely considered}} the best lawyer {{of the day in}} France. Le Coq kept meticulous notes of the entire trial process and it is through his record that many of {{the facts of the case}} are known. Le Coq also comments in his records his own suspicions about his client, whose claims of innocence he considered to be false. Le Gris was urged by his family and lawyer to insist on being tried in a church court, which as a cleric in minor orders was his right. This would have given him a more favourable hearing in a court which did not condone trial by combat and thus would also be <b>much</b> <b>safer.</b> Le Gris rebuffed this advice and became angry when challenged on the decision, insisting on his right to trial before the Parlement.|$|E
5|$|Fairley's {{proposed}} use of atebrin as a prophylactic {{agent was}} accepted and Fairley switched the Australian Army over to using atebrin as a prophylaxis instead of quinine in March 1943. The most acute problem {{at this time}} was a shortage of atebrin. The Australian Army had only seven weeks' stock was on hand in March 1943 and US forces in both the South West Pacific and South Pacific Area were drawing on Australian Army stocks as they had not yet received adequate stocks of their own. The drug is also a dye, and had the known side effect of making the skin and eyeballs of the user go yellow in colour after repeated use but this was an acceptable drawback in wartime. Prolonged use could cause lichen planus and psychosis in rare cases, but atebrin still {{turned out to be}} <b>much</b> <b>safer</b> than quinine.

5|$|Why {{they went}} to land {{in the first place}} is still debated. One reason could be that the small juveniles who had {{completed}} their metamorphosis had what it took to make use of what land had to offer. Already adapted to breathe air and move around in shallow waters near land as a protection (just as modern fish and amphibians often spend the first part of their life in the comparative safety of shallow waters like mangrove forests), two very different niches partially overlapped each other, with the young juveniles in the diffuse line between. One of them was overcrowded and dangerous while the other was <b>much</b> <b>safer</b> and much less crowded, offering less competition over resources. The terrestrial niche was also a much more challenging place for primary aquatic animals, but because of the way evolution and selection pressure work, those juveniles who could take advantage of this would be rewarded. Once they gained a small foothold on land, thanks to their preadaptations and being at {{the right place at the}} right time, favourable variations in their descendants would gradually result in continuing evolution and diversification.|$|E
