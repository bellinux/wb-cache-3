Contamination poses a frequent challenge depending on the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>collection</b> used, thus a cutoff of 105CFU/mL is used for a [...] "clean-catch" [...] mid stream sample, 104CFU/mL is used for catheter-obtained specimens, and 102CFU/mL is used for suprapubic aspirations (a sample drawn directly from the bladder with a needle). The use of [...] "urine bags" [...] to collect samples is discouraged by the World Health Organization due to {{the high rate of}} contamination when cultured, and catheterization is preferred in those not toilet trained. Some, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends renal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram (watching a person's urethra and urinary bladder with real time x-rays while they urinate) in all children less than two years old who have had a urinary tract infection. However, because {{there is a lack of}} effective treatment if problems are found, others such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence only recommends routine imaging in those less than six months old or who have unusual findings.|$|E

Under the invoice <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>collection,</b> each seller charges VAT rate on his output and passes the buyer a special invoice that {{indicates}} the amount of tax charged. Buyers who are subject to VAT on their own sales (output tax), consider the tax on the purchase invoices as input tax and can deduct the sum from their own VAT liability. The difference between output tax and input tax is paid to the government (or a refund is claimed, {{in the case of}} negative liability). Under the accounts based method, no such specific invoices are used. Instead, the tax is calculated on the value added, measured as a difference between revenues and allowable purchases. Most countries today use the invoice method, the only exception being Japan, which uses the accounts method.|$|E
