5|$|The M15 was {{equipped}} with the M42 armored weapon mount, with two water-cooled coaxial M2 Browning machine guns above a 37mm gun. A total of 680 M15s were produced in 1943 by White and Autocar before the considerable stress this mount placed on the M3 chassis, which resulted in its replacement with the M54 <b>mount.</b> <b>The</b> new mount reversed weapon placement, used simpler and lighter air-cooled M2 Brownings, and added a M6 sighting system.|$|E

Australian warships and the fighter, bomber and airfield construction squadrons of No.10Operational Group RAAF participated in the capture of Hollandia, Biak, Noemfoor and Morotai. After western New Guinea was secured No.10Operation Group was renamed the First Tactical Air Force (1TAF) and was used to protect the flank of the Allied advance by attacking Japanese positions in the NEI and performing other garrison tasks. The losses incurred whilst performing these relatively unimportant roles led to a decline in morale, and contributed to the 'Morotai Mutiny' in April 1945.|$|E

Sir David Lindsay of the <b>Mount</b> <b>the</b> Lord Lyon, {{the head of the}} Lyon Court and diplomat, was a prolific poet. He produced an interlude at Linlithgow Palace thought to be a version of his play The Thrie Estaitis in 1540, the first surviving full Scottish play, which satirised the corruption of church and state, making use of elements such as medieval morality plays, with a humanist agenda.|$|E
5|$|As {{a patron}} of poets and authors James V {{supported}} William Stewart and John Bellenden, who translated the Latin History of Scotland compiled in 1527 by Hector Boece, into verse and prose. Sir David Lindsay of the <b>Mount</b> <b>the</b> Lord Lyon, {{the head of}} the Lyon Court and diplomat, was a prolific poet. He produced an interlude at Linlithgow Palace thought to be a version of his play The Thrie Estaitis in 1540. James also attracted the attention of international authors. When he married Mary of Guise, Giovanni Ferrerio, an Italian scholar who had been at Kinloss Abbey in Scotland, dedicated to the couple a new edition of his work, On the true significance of comets against the vanity of astrologers. Like Henry VIII, James employed many foreign artisans and craftsmen to enhance the prestige of his renaissance Court.|$|E
5|$|Further {{armament}} was {{to consist}} of a 128mm anti-tank gun of the type used in the Jagdtiger or Maus, two 15mm Mauser MG 151/15 autocannons, and eight 20mm Flak 38 anti-aircraft guns, probably with at least four {{of them as a}} Flakvierling quad <b>mount.</b> <b>The</b> 128mm anti-tank gun's precise location on the Ratte is a point of contention among historians, most believing {{that it would have been}} mounted within the primary turret, with some others thinking a smaller secondary turret at the rear of the Ratte more logical. Some concept drawings exist to suggest a flexible mount on the glacis plate. The tank was to be provided with a vehicle bay that could hold two BMW R12 motorcycles for scouting, and several smaller storage rooms, a compact infirmary area, and a self-contained lavatory system.|$|E

5|$|In October 1940, {{development}} {{began to}} produce a vehicle {{in response to a}} long-standing requirement for an anti-aircraft vehicle to protect the U.S. Army's mechanized troop convoys from aerial attack. The first vehicle produced {{in the development of a}} half track with an anti-aircraft armament was the T1, which had two M2 machine guns on a Bendix machine gun mountas used on jeepson a 4×4 truck. The T1E1 had a power-operated Bendix mount, and the T1E2 a Maxson <b>mount.</b> <b>The</b> T1E3 had an electro-dynamic Glenn L. Martin Company aircraft-type turret. Evaluation of these test vehicles led to the T1E2 design being preferred. The T1E2 became the M16 Half-track by replacing the M33 with the M45 mount and the M2 Half-track chassis with the M3 Half-track chassis.|$|E

5|$|Later in August, Alabama {{departed}} for the Pacific theater; {{the ship was}} assigned to the US Third Fleet during the amphibious operations in the Gilbert islands, particularly Kwajalein in early 1944. During the night of 21 February 1944, Alabamas 5-inch guns were firing upon Japanese aircraft in the area. The ship turned {{in the direction of the}} Japanese aircraft in order to better engage them, but the rearmost turret was masked behind the amidships <b>mount.</b> <b>The</b> gunner in the rearmost turret accidentally overrode the safety mechanism that prevented the gun from firing in that circumstance, and when the gun was fired, it hit the 5-inch turret in front of it. Five men were killed and 11 wounded in the incident; an investigation revealed that the override switch was faulty and prone to accidental operation.|$|E

Members of the third batch (70045–70054) were equipped with another tender design, the BR1D, which had 9 tons of coal and 4,750 gallons of water, {{due to the fact}} that they were intended for use on longer runs in the north of the railway network. This tender design also featured a steam-powered coal pusher, which eliminated the need for crew members to <b>mount</b> <b>the</b> tender to pull forward coal when the locomotive was at a stop.|$|E
