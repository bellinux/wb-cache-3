25|$|Despite his {{experience}} in the ballet world, Henze had never before composed a subject in the romantic style which Ashton requested, however Ashton had been impressed by Henze's treatment of magical material in his opera König Hirsch. Henze attended many ballet performances at Covent Garden, frequently accompanied by Ashton who told him clearly what he liked {{and what he did}} not like in <b>music</b> <b>for</b> <b>dance.</b> Eventually the work was completed, but when Ashton heard a recording of the orchestrated score he realised {{that he would have to}} revise his ideas; the sustained orchestral sounds were such a contrast to the piano score and made him think very differently.|$|E

2500|$|Tin Pan Alley was {{the biggest}} source of popular music early in the 20th century (Garofolo, 17). [...] Tin Pan Alley was a place in New York City which {{published}} sheet <b>music</b> <b>for</b> <b>dance</b> songs like [...] "After the Ball Is Over". [...] The first few decades of the 20th century also saw the rise of popular, comic musical theater, such as the vaudeville tradition and composers and writers like Oscar Hammerstein II, Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin. [...] At the same time, jazz and blues, two distinct but related genres, began flourishing in cities like Memphis, Chicago and New Orleans and began to attract some mainstream audiences.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1980s, Glass {{produced}} [...] "works {{in different}} media at an extraordinarily rapid pace". Projects from that period include <b>music</b> <b>for</b> <b>dance</b> (Glass Pieces choreographed for New York City Ballet by Jerome Robbins in 1983 to a score drawn from existing Glass compositions created for other media including {{an excerpt from}} Akhnaten; and In the Upper Room, Twyla Tharp, 1986), music for theatre productions Endgame (1984) and Company (1983). Beckett vehemently disapproved of the production of Endgame at the American Repertory Theater (Cambridge, Massachusetts), which featured JoAnne Akalaitis's direction and Glass's Prelude for timpani and double bass, but in the end, he authorized the music for Company, four short, intimate pieces for string quartet that were played in the intervals of the dramatization. This composition was initially regarded by the composer {{as a piece of}} Gebrauchsmusik ('music for use')—"like salt and pepper (...) just something for the table", as he noted. Eventually Company was published as Glass's String Quartet No. 2 and in a version for string orchestra, being performed by ensembles ranging from student orchestras to renowned formations such as the Kronos Quartet and the Kremerata Baltica.|$|E
