This design was easier to manufacture, easier to maintain and provided the flexibility to add and remove options without affecting <b>the</b> entire <b>vehicle's</b> wiring architecture. Each <b>module,</b> a node <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> network, controls specific components related to its function and communicates with the other modules as necessary, using a standard protocol, over <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> network.|$|R
2500|$|... 1980: General Motors {{implements}} {{a proprietary}} interface and protocol for {{testing of the}} Engine Control <b>Module</b> (ECM) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> assembly line. <b>The</b> 'assembly line diagnostic link' (ALDL) protocol broadcasts at 160 bit/s Implemented <b>on</b> California <b>vehicles</b> for <b>the</b> 1980 model year, {{and the rest of}} the United States in 1981. Most owners can read DTCs (Diagnostic Trouble Code(s)) by commanding the ECM (Engine Control Module) to flash the CEL (Check Engine Lamp) or MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) on and off. [...] A PC based Software package called WinALDL will listen to the CLCC (Closed Loop Carburetor Control) and early CLC EFI datastreams over a fairly easy to construct interface cable that converts the 160 baud TTL serial data being transmitted by the ECM to RS232 or USB serial data [...] but there is not much information transmitted by these early ECMs.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} of vision stabilization, potentially applied to mobile robot or unmanned vehicle, which is inspired by the characteristics of human eye. Vision information processing is a key technology of intelligent mobile platform. However, in some condition, such as <b>the</b> vision <b>module</b> mount <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> moving <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rugged ground, the system could not acquire stable vision, which influence the post-process of image information and make the observer uncomfortable. With video stabilization technology, the unwanted vibrations or shakes of video sequences is smoothed at real time speed. The algorithm proposed is mainly based on digital image stabilization technology, which divides the whole vision in 9 sub-area averagely, then processes searching and matching strategy by macro block with size of 16 × 16 or 8 × 8 pixels. Both the start point for searching and motion vector are predicted by the motion trend. After the motion compensation procedure, the video is stabilized. During the procedure above, the edge area of the video is lost. In this paper, a recovery method inspired by human vision is discussed, which consider the duration of vision factors. With the evaluating a sequence of unstable images acquired by vision system <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mobile robot, we can draw {{the conclusion that the}} effectiveness and validation of the method aforementioned is implemented...|$|R
40|$|Overheating issues <b>on</b> <b>the</b> University of Illinois???s Formula SAE cars {{prompted}} a study evaluating the cooling module performance. The challenge faced by many Formula SAE teams internationally {{is a large}} limit on their budget and resources {{as well as their}} short development cycle. The developed experimental method needed to be straight-forward and to use the limited equipment available and supplied by the university. A simple and cost effective method for analyzing the heat carrying capacity of <b>the</b> cooling <b>module</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Formula SAE <b>vehicles</b> was developed. Simple fixtures were designed and built in order to equip the Formula SAE car with sensors able to acquire the necessary data in order to calculate the heat carrying capacities of the air flowing through the heat exchanger and the water flowing through the engine. Physical testing was successfully carried out under driving conditions whenever possible to attain the most applicable results. The University of Illinois???s 2009 Formula SAE car was tested to determine the effectiveness of its cooling system and to identify problem areas. It was found that design changes made from 2008 to 2009 did provide {{a significant increase in the}} capacity of the cooling module to adequately cool the Honda F 4 i engine <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Formula SAE car. In addition, the cooling capacity of the system was quantified for the first time for the Formula SAE team. Results from this research laid groundwork for future improvements <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Formula SAE car to be quickly and cheaply evaluated and compared with previous baselines using the tools available from the university and avoiding guess work...|$|R
