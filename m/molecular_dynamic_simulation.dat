In the case of the classical simulation we use the potential proposed by van Beest et al. (BKS) whereas the ab initio simulation is done with a Car-Parrinello method (CPMD). We find that the surfaces generated by BKS have a higher concentration of defects (e. g. concentration of two-membered rings) than those generated with CPMD. In addition also the distribution functions of the angles and of the distances are different for the short rings. Hence we conclude that whereas the BKS potential is able to reproduce correctly the surface on the length scale beyond approx 5 Angstroems, it is necessary to use an ab initio method to predict reliably the structure at small scales.
