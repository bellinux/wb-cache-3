2500|$|In late 1965, after {{numerous}} car-club dances, juke joint gigs, {{appearances at}} the Avalon Ballroom {{and winning the}} Teenage Fair Battle of the Bands, the group finally bagged a contract for recording two singles with the newly created A Records label with Leonard Grant as their manager. It was {{at this time that}} musical relationships had also been struck with members of Rising Sons who would later feature in the band's recordings. The A deal also brought some contention between members of the band, torn between a career as an experimental [...] "pop" [...] group and that of a purist blues band. Working with young producer David Gates also opened up horizons for Vliet's skills as a poet-cum-lyricist, with his [...] "Who Do You Think You're Fooling" [...] on the flipside of the band's first single, a cover of the Ellas McDaniel/Willie Dixon-penned hit, [...] "Diddy Wah Diddy". Fate and circumstance, not for the first time, would befall the band's success upon its release â€“ which coincided with a singles cover of the same song by the Remains. The initial line-up of the Magic Band that entered the studio for the A recordings was not that which emerged by the second release, [...] "Moonchild", also backed by a Vliet-penned number, [...] "Frying Pan". A 12" [...] vinyl 45rpm mono EP/mono <b>mini-cassette</b> tape was later released in 1987, with the four tracks of the two singles, plus [...] "Here I Am, I Always Am" [...] as a fifth previously unreleased song. This release was titled The Legendary A Sessions, with a red-marbled cover and (later) members Moon, Blakely, Vliet, Snouffer and Handley seated in a [...] "temperance dance band" [...] photo-pose.|$|E
5000|$|Philips Speech Processing {{was founded}} in 1954, when the first {{dictation}} machine was produced in Vienna. In 1957, the first cassette-based dictation machine followed. One of the company's achievements was {{the development of the}} <b>Mini-Cassette</b> (also referred to as minicassette) in 1967. The <b>Mini-Cassette</b> had a tape cassette format, mainly for the use with dictation recorders, which is still today's standard in professional analog dictation. The cassettes were subsequently used in the Philips Pocket Memo devices, which were launched in the same year.|$|E
50|$|A smaller {{version of}} the <b>Mini-Cassette</b> was later {{introduced}} {{that could be used}} in a standard player using an adaptor; however, this did not become widespread.|$|E
50|$|Inside, {{they found}} Buster {{chained to the}} wall. Buster told them what Decepticons were up to, but the room was too small for Blaster to {{transform}} and cut the chain, {{so they had to}} leave him behind. Against Blaster's advice, Jessie sneaked into a Decepticon meeting and stole Raindance and Grand Slam. The theft was soon discovered, and Ratbat sent the Seacons to the beach in pursuit. Blaster transformed to protect the tourists. The battle was going badly, so Blaster spit the <b>mini-cassettes</b> into the ocean to lure the Seacons away.|$|R
5000|$|In 1947, having {{relied on}} wax-cylinder {{recording}} {{to the end}} of World War II, Dictaphone introduced their Dictabelt technology. This cut a mechanical groove into a Lexan plastic belt instead of a wax cylinder. The advantage of the Lexan belt was that recordings were permanent and admissible in court. Eventually IBM introduced a dictating machine using an erasable belt made of magnetic tape which enabled the user to correct dictation errors rather than marking errors on a paper tab. Dictaphone in turn added magnetic recording models while still selling the models recording on the Lexan belts. Machines based on magnetic tape recording were introduced in the late seventies, initially using the standard compact (or [...] "C") cassette, but soon, in dictation machines, using <b>mini-cassettes</b> or microcassettes instead. The size of the cassette was important as it enabled the manufacturer {{to reduce the size of}} portable recorders.|$|R
50|$|Sharp and Hewlett-Packard {{also sold}} {{dedicated}} micro- or <b>mini-cassette</b> recorders that connected {{directly to the}} calculator. These set-ups, while being more practical and reliable, were also more expensive.|$|E
50|$|The P2000T was a Z80-based home {{computer}} that used a Teletext display chip {{to produce the}} video picture and a small <b>Mini-Cassette</b> recorder for 42 kilobytes of mass storage capacity. The <b>Mini-Cassette</b> {{was treated as a}} floppy drive from the user's perspective while using the automatic search for a program (CLOAD command) or free space (CSAVE). A command to display the directory of the cassette also exists. Philips used components they already produced for other markets (television sets and dictation machines) to quickly design a small computer system. It was partially designed by Austrian professor Dieter Hammer.|$|E
50|$|Packaged {{with fellow}} <b>mini-cassette</b> Rumble, the Ravage toy {{originated}} in Takaras Microman line, featuring household objects that transformed into small, in-scale robots. Armed with two chromed missiles that insert into the spool {{holes in his}} rear end, he {{can be stored in}} the chest door of the Soundwave toy.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Mini-Cassette,</b> often written minicassette, is a {{magnetic}} tape audio cassette format introduced by Philips in 1967. It is used primarily in dictation machines {{and was also}} employed as a data storage for the Philips P2000 home computer. Unlike the Compact Cassette, also designed by Philips, and the later Microcassette, introduced by Olympus, the <b>Mini-Cassette</b> does not use a capstan drive system; instead, the tape is propelled past the tape head by the reels. This is mechanically simple and allows the cassette to be made smaller and easier to use, but produces a system unsuited to any task other than voice recording, as the tape speed is not constant (averaging 2.4 cm/s) and prone to wow and flutter. However, {{the lack of a}} capstan and a pinch roller drive means that the tape is well-suited to being repeatedly shuttled forward and backward short distances as compared to microcassettes, leading to the Mini-Cassette's use in the first generations of telephone answering machines, and continuing use in the niche markets of dictation and transcription, where fidelity is not critical, but robustness of storage is, and where analog media are still widely preferred.|$|E
5000|$|A {{very early}} tablet-style {{personal}} computer system - the WorkSlate - {{was designed and}} marketed by Convergent Technologies. Its primary user interface was a spreadsheet. The tablet utilized a <b>mini-cassette</b> for voice- and data-recording and for loading a range of pre-packaged [...] "Add-on" [...] applications to handle tasks such as the management of personal expenses, calendars, etc. (At that time there was no facility to download such [...] "apps" [...] over the Internet, so they were available only on the mini-cassettes.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Mike survives, {{and he and}} Lily {{are seen}} back {{together}} in their home, although she is unsure of the supernatural events he has explained to her. Lily finds Mike's possessions that were rescued from 1408 and suggested disposing of them because they are ruined by smoke. Mike takes them, saying, [...] "Bad memories {{are not to be}} forgotten, they are meant to be lived with." [...] Lily now realizes Mike is ready to move on from his daughter's death. Suddenly they hear Katie's voice on the <b>mini-cassette</b> recorder, confirming his account.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{invention}} of the audion tube in 1906, electric microphones gradually replaced the purely acoustical recording methods of earlier dictaphones by the late 1930s. In 1945, the SoundScriber and Gray Audograph, which cut grooves into a plastic disc, was introduced, and two years later Dictaphone replaced wax cylinders with their Dictabelt technology, which cut a mechanical groove into a plastic belt instead of into a wax cylinder. This was later replaced by magnetic tape recording. While reel-to-reel tape was used for dictation, the inconvenience of threading tape spools led to development of more convenient formats, notably the Compact Cassette, <b>Mini-Cassette,</b> and Microcassette.|$|E
5000|$|Philips {{introduced}} the first combination portable radio and cassette recorder, which was marketed as the [...] "radiorecorder", {{and is now}} {{better known as the}} boom box. Later, the cassette was used in telephone answering machines, including a special form of cassette where the tape was wound on an endless loop. The C-cassette was used as the first mass storage device for early personal computers in the 1970s and 1980s. Philips reduced the cassette size for the professional needs with the <b>Mini-Cassette,</b> although it would not be as successful as the Olympus Microcassette. This became the predominant dictation medium up to the advent of fully digital dictation machines.|$|E
5000|$|Coleman's {{career as}} a voice actor took off in the 1980s when, having {{recently}} moved to Los Angeles, he auditioned {{for the role of}} Corporal Capeman on Inspector Gadget. He also portrayed Riot on Jem, Gobo in the animated version of Jim Henson's Fraggle Rock, Scott Howard on the animated Teen Wolf and many others. In TV commercials, he was the 7-Up [...] "Spot", Keebler Elves, and Raid Bugs. Coleman has also been the voice of NBC commercials for programs such as Must See TV and The Tonight Show since the early 1990s. Coleman has also provided the voice for Jason Whittaker on the Focus on the Family radio drama Adventures in Odyssey since 1994. He also voiced the Autobot <b>Mini-Cassette</b> Rewind on the Transformers cartoon series (1986) and provided the voice of Colt in Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{inside the}} room, Mike {{describes}} on his <b>mini-cassette</b> recorder the room's boring appearance and its unimpressive lack of supernatural behavior. During his examination, the clock radio starts playing [...] "We've Only Just Begun", a hit song by The Carpenters. Mike assumes that Olin is pulling a prank to scare him. At 8:07, the song plays {{again and the}} clock's digital display changes to a countdown starting from [...] "60:00". The window slams down and breaks his hand. He begins to see hallucinations and ghosts of the room's past victims, and visions of his own dead family members, including his father and Katie. Mike tries to leave, but in vain: the room brass key is sucked into the lock and the doorknob falls off; climbing through the air ducts prompts an attack from the corpse of O'Malley; and his attempt to escape to an adjacent room by walking along the outside window ledge reveals {{the windows of the}} other rooms have disappeared.|$|E
