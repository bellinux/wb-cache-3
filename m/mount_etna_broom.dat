40|$|Despite {{the clear}} {{evidence}} of active flank dynamics that is affecting {{the eastern side of}} <b>Mount</b> <b>Etna,</b> the contribution of tectonic processes has not been yet understood. So far, the various models proposed to explain the observed flank deformation have been based on onshore structural data, coming from the volcanic edifice. The Ionian offshore of <b>Mount</b> <b>Etna</b> has been only recently investigated using multichannel seismic profiles, and offers the opportunity to image the structural features of the substrate of the unstable flank of the volcano. This contribution aims at describing the deformation located offshore <b>Mount</b> <b>Etna</b> using multichannel seismic profiles recently acquired during three seismic surveys. The onshore flank deformation of <b>Mount</b> <b>Etna</b> appears to be laterally confined by two tectonic guidelines, trending roughly E–W, located to the north and south of the deforming flank; the northern guideline, in particular, takes the surface expression of a sharp fault (Pernicana Fault). Though often assumed that these boundary structures continue offshore as linear features, connected to a frontal thrust ramp, the occurrence of this simple offshore structural system has not been imaged. In fact, seismic data show a remarkable degree of structural complexity offshore <b>Mount</b> <b>Etna.</b> The Pernicana Fault, for instance, is not continuing offshore as a sharp feature; rather, the deformation is expressed as ENE–WSW folds located very close to the coastline. It is possible that these tectonic structures might have affected the offshore of <b>Mount</b> <b>Etna</b> before the Pernicana Fault system was developed, less than 15 ka ago. The southern guideline of the collapsing eastern flank of the volcano is poorly expressed onshore, and does not show up offshore; in fact, seismic data indicate that the Catania canyon, a remarkable E–W-trending feature, does not reflect a tectonic control. Seismic interpretation also shows the occurrence of a structural high located just offshore the edifice of <b>Mount</b> <b>Etna.</b> Whereas a complex deformation affects the boundary of this offshore bulge, it shows only limited internal deformation. Part of the topography of the offshore bulge pre-existed the constructional phase of <b>Mount</b> <b>Etna,</b> being an extension of the Hyblean Plateau. Only in the northern part, the bulge is a recent tectonic feature, being composed by Plio-Quaternary strata that were folded before and during the building of <b>Mount</b> <b>Etna.</b> The offshore bulge is bounded by a thrust fault that can be related to the intrusion of the large-scale magmatic body below <b>Mount</b> <b>Etna...</b>|$|R

40|$|Analysis of fossils from cave {{deposits}} at <b>Mount</b> <b>Etna</b> (eastern-central Queensland) {{has established}} that a species-rich rainforest palaeoenvironment existed {{in that area}} during the middle Pleistocene. This unexpected finding has implications for several fields (e. g., biogeography/phylogeography of rainforest-adapted taxa, {{and the impact of}} climate change on rainforest communities), but it was unknown whether the <b>Mount</b> <b>Etna</b> sites represented a small refugial patch of rainforest or was more widespread. In this study numerous bone deposits in caves in north-east Queensland are analysed to reconstruct the environmental history of the area during the late Quaternary. Study sites are in the Chillagoe/Mitchell Palmer and Broken River/Christmas Creek areas. The cave fossil records in these study areas are compared with dated (middle Pleistocene-Holocene) cave sites in the <b>Mount</b> <b>Etna</b> area. Substantial taxonomic work on the <b>Mount</b> <b>Etna</b> faunas (particularly dasyurid marsupials and murine rodents) is also presented as a prerequisite for meaningful comparison with the study sites further north. Middle Pleistocene sites at <b>Mount</b> <b>Etna</b> contain species indicative of a rainforest palaeoenvironment. Small mammal assemblages in the <b>Mount</b> <b>Etna</b> rainforest sites (> 500 - 280 ka) are unexpectedly diverse and composed almost entirely of new species. Included in the rainforest assemblages are lineages with no extant representatives in rainforest (e. g., Leggadina), one genus previously known only from New Guinea (Abeomelomys), and forms that appear to bridge gaps between related but morphologically-divergent extant taxa ('B-rat' and 'Pseudomys C'). Curiously, some taxa (e. g., Melomys spp.) are notable for their absence from the <b>Mount</b> <b>Etna</b> rainforest sites. After 280 ka the rainforest faunas are replaced by species adapted to open, dry habitats. At that time the extinct ‘rainforest’ dasyurids and rodents are replaced by species that are either extant or recently extant. By the late Pleistocene all ‘rainforest’ and several ‘dry’ taxa are locally or completely extinct, and the small mammal fauna resembles that found in the area today. The faunal/environmental changes recorded in the <b>Mount</b> <b>Etna</b> sites were interpreted by previous workers as the result of shifts in climate during the Pleistocene. Many samples from caves in the Chillagoe/Mitchell-Palmer and Broken River/Christmas Creek areas are held in the Queensland Museum’s collection. These, supplemented with additional samples collected in the field as well as samples supplied by other workers, were systematically and palaeoecologically analysed for the first time. Palaeoecological interpretation of the faunal assemblages in the sites suggests that they encompass a similar array of palaeoenvironments as the <b>Mount</b> <b>Etna</b> sites. ‘Rainforest’ sites at the Broken River are here interpreted as being of similar age to those at <b>Mount</b> <b>Etna,</b> suggesting the possibility of extensive rainforest coverage in eastern tropical Queensland during part of the Pleistocene. Likewise, faunas suggesting open, dry palaeoenvironments are found at Chillagoe, the Broken River and <b>Mount</b> <b>Etna,</b> and may be of similar age. The 'dry' faunal assemblage at <b>Mount</b> <b>Etna</b> (Elephant hole Cave) dates to 205 - 170 ka. Dating of one of the Chillagoe sites (QML 1067) produced a maximum age for the deposit of approximately 200 ka, and the site is interpreted as being close to that age, supporting the interpretation of roughly contemporaneous deposition at <b>Mount</b> <b>Etna</b> and Chillagoe. Finally, study sites interpreted as being of late Pleistocene-Holocene age show faunal similarities to sites of that age near <b>Mount</b> <b>Etna.</b> This study has several important implications for the biogeography and phylogeography of murine rodents, and represents a major advance {{in the study of the}} Australian murine fossil record. Likewise the survey of the northern study areas is the first systematic analysis of multiple sites in those areas, and is thus a major contribution to knowledge of tropical Australian faunas during the Quaternary. This analysis suggests that climatic changes during the Pleistocene affected a large area of eastern tropical Queensland in similar ways. Further fieldwork and dating is required to properly analyse the geographical extent and timing of faunal change in eastern tropical Queensland...|$|R
