25|$|It is {{important}} that the gas mixture in a cylinder is thoroughly mixed before analysing or the results will be inaccurate. When partial pressure or mass blending is done at low flow rates the gases entering the cylinder are not moving fast enough to ensure good mixing, and particularly when blends contain Helium, they may tend to remain in layers due to density differences. This is termed stratification, and if left long enough, diffusion will ensure complete mixing. However, if the gas is to be analysed soon after blending, <b>mechanical</b> <b>agitation</b> is recommended. This may be by lying a single cylinder on a flat surface and rolling it for a short period, but twins are more usually inverted a few times. Stratification is more pronounced with blends containing helium, but can also lead to inaccurate analysis of Nitrox blends.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{piezoelectric}} {{generation of}} perovskite BaTiO 3 thin films on a flexible substrate {{has been applied}} to convert mechanical energy to electrical energy for the first time. Ferroelectric BaTiO 3 thin films were deposited by radio frequency magnetron sputtering on a Pt/Ti/SiO 2 /(100) Si substrate and poled under an electric field of 100 kV/cm. The metal-insulator (BaTiO 3) -metal-structured ribbons were successfully transferred onto a flexible substrate and connected by interdigitated electrodes. When periodically deformed by a bending stage, a flexible BaTiO 3 nanogenerator can generate an output voltage of up to 1. 0 V. The fabricated nanogenerator produced an output current density of 0. 19 µA/cm 2 and a power density of ∼ 7 mW/cm 3.

40|$|To {{fabricate}} living cell-based immunological sensors, we {{have examined}} two PEO-based biomaterials {{that can be}} patterned to generate cellular array templates: poly(allylamine) -g- poly(ethylene glycol) graft-copolymer and poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate hydrogel. Poly(allylamine) -g-poly(ethylene glycol) polycation graft-copolymers were designed, synthesized, and characterized in order to combine bio-functionality with patternability on charged polyelectrolyte multilayer surfaces. Polymer-on-polymer stamping (POPS) techniques were used to create micron scale patterned regions on negatively charged multilayer surfaces via direct stamping of these graft copolymers. The long PEG side chains effectively resisted adsorption of antibodies or other proteins, and created a bio-inert area when patterned by POPS. On the other hand, desired proteins can be covalently attached to the graft copolymer by introducing proper coupling agents. Arrays of proteins were produced by either simple adsorption or coupling of proteins onto the graft copolymer patterned surfaces. The protein arrays were utilized as templates in fabricating cellular arrays of non-adherent B cells. (cont.) Poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate hydrogel precursors were photopolymerized into 3 D rmicrowell array templates via micromolding. After the floors of microwells were decorated with antibodies, hydrogel microwell array templates were employed in fabrication of cellular arrays. The topology of microwells facilitates the positioning of cells inside microwells and improves the binding stability of cells with protection from <b>mechanical</b> <b>agitations.</b> T cell arrays fabricated on hydrogel microwell array templates were tested as living cell- based immunological sensors. B cells were settled uniformly on T cell arrays to establish contacts between B and T cells over a large area. A level of T cell activation by target peptides were quantified using calcium sensitive fura dyes. A large set of individual T cell response data was acquired from a single T cell array and utilized to obtain average dose-response behavior of T cells. Average T cell responses were suitable as quantitative signal of a living cell-based immunological sensor. In addition, a potential application of T cell arrays in high throughput assay of individual T cell responses was investigated. (cont.)

40|$|Modal {{noise in}} optical fibers imposes {{limits on the}} signal to noise and {{velocity}} precision achievable with {{the next generation of}} astronomical spectrographs. This is an increasingly pressing problem for precision radial velocity (RV) spectrographs in the near-infrared (NIR) and optical that require both high stability of the observed line profiles and high signal to noise. Many of these spectrographs plan to use highly coherent emission line calibration sources like laser frequency combs and Fabry-Perot etalons to achieve precision sufficient to detect terrestrial mass planets. These high precision calibration sources often use single mode fibers or highly coherent sources. Coupling light from single mode fibers to multi-mode fibers leads to only a very low number of modes being excited, thereby exacerbating the modal noise measured by the spectrograph. We present a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solution that significantly mitigates modal noise at all optical and NIR wavelengths, and which can be applied to spectrograph calibration systems. Our solution uses an integrating sphere in conjunction with a diffuser that is moved rapidly using electrostrictive polymers, and is generally superior to most tested forms of <b>mechanical</b> fiber <b>agitation.</b> We demonstrate a high level of modal noise reduction with a narrow bandwidth 1550 nm laser.

40|$|Membrane {{distillation}} (MD) is {{an emerging}} low energy desalination technology, where low-grade heat source can be utilized to provide heat to the feed, offering an alternative solution to saline concentrate treatment. Yet, MD still suffers prominently from scaling, wetting and low flux. To overcome these problems, methods of fouling control are frequently investigated, such as process optimization by selecting the appropriate operational parameters and cleaning protocols, and refining the intrinsic {{properties of the}} membrane {{to meet the needs}} of membrane distillation, in terms of enhanced fouling/wetting resistance and reduced mass transfer resistance. This dissertation examined the fouling mechanisms in MD process by different substances in treating saline concentrates produced from coal seam gas generation, as well as the desalination of brackish groundwater. In particular, the fouling mechanisms of substances such as alkaline scalants, silica, and humic acids were studied. During the treatment of coal seam gas water with the presence of silica, magnesium formed porous structured depositions with silica, which caused a less severe flux decline as compared to the feed without silica. Initially, the precipitation of calcite was spotted, followed by the deposition of magnesium silicate and sodium chloride. The roles of fouling control via intermittent cleaning, <b>mechanical</b> <b>agitations,</b> as well as an integrated thermal crystallizer were investigated. As such, cleaning of the membrane prior to catastrophic membrane degradation is a critical operating protocol as an approach to the maintenance of membrane performance. It should be noted that the approaches to fouling control should be carefully selected according to the specific fouling mechanism by the pollutants present in the feed. While vigorous agitations might be undesirable in MD process for the treatment of inorganic feed, it was discovered that the application of an integrated thermal crystallizer could help sustain membrane performance and harvest crystals. On the other hand, high speed transverse vibration at 500 rpm was found to be effective in fouling control for the treatment of brackish groundwater concentrates with a considerable amount of humic aicds. This work also explored the effect of surface engineering on membrane performance for different MD processes. To be specific, two approaches to surface functionalization were investigated as the purpose of different MD applications, namely Janus hydrophobic-hydrophilic membrane and superhydrophobic surface. To fabricate a Janus membrane, a facile solution-immersion method in the dopamine solution was applied. Significant increase of flux measured in a submerged direct contact membrane distillation configuration was observed from the modified membrane by this approach. The thickness of the hydrophilic layer determined the flux values and the rejection rate for long-term operation in saline solution; the trade-off caused by these two parameters should be carefully examined during the design of membrane. The maximum flux enhancement achieved by the Janus membranes was 120 % as compared to the nascent membranes. To fabricate the superhydrophobic surface, the membrane was immersed in the dopamine solution, followed by the deposition of silica nano-particles and low surface energy material of 1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane (PDTS). The modified membrane showed enhanced anti-fouling and anti-wetting properties in a submerged vacuum membrane distillation setup for the desalination of brackish groundwater concentrates and sodium chloride solution. Both modified membranes showed superior stability in long-term desalination processes for MD applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) is generally done using standard spray application techniques. However, {{in contrast to}} chemical pesticides, these biological antagonists must remain viable {{during and after the}} application process. For the {{application of}} EPN, a good agitation system is indispensable as the nematodes tend to sediment fast in a spray tank without agitation. Three <b>agitation</b> systems, viz. <b>mechanical,</b> pneumatic and hydraulic agitation were tested for their ability to keep Steinernema carpocapsae (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae) suspended in an undamaged way. Hydraulic agitation was tested using a centrifugal and a diaphragm pump. Nematode damage was quantified based on viability and infectivity of the EPN. The ability of the agitation system to keep the nematodes in suspension was examined by comparing the nematode concentration observed in the samples taken at different agitation times. Only the hydraulic agitation using the centrifugal pump damaged the nematodes. After 120 min of recirculation, only 19. 3 % of the nematodes survived. Infectivity was even reduced to 0 %. An additional experiment revealed that the temperature rise, from 21. 7 to 45. 4 degrees C, was responsible for the observed nematode damage. The concentration measurements showed that the pneumatic agitation was unstable. Agitation during 120 min using the other agitation systems resulted in a significant loss of nematodes at 15 cm above the spray tank bottom. In conclusion, <b>mechanical</b> and hydraulic <b>agitation</b> using a diaphragm pump can be recommended when S. carpocapsae is applied, although attention should be paid to possible nematode loss during application...|$|R

40|$|At {{the moment}} melanins are still enigmatic bio-pigments with {{structure}} and determination methods not clearly understood {{for the international}} scientific community. Among biopolymers, melanins are unique in many aspects. Some essential biopolymers (proteins, nucleic acids and carbohydrates) are chemically well characterized and can be determined using well established analytical methodologies. On the contrary, no available methods allow us to accurately determine melanin, mostly due to the intrinsic chemical properties of melanins. These pigments, in fact, are insoluble in {{a broad range of}} solvents and pH as well as difficult to purify {{as a result of the}} heterogeneity in their structural features. Mammalian melanins exist in two chemically distinct forms: the brown to black Eumelanin and the yellow to reddish-brown Pheomelanin. Sepia melanin obtained from Sepia officinalis consists of more than 98 % of Eumelanin and is therefore used as standard material in the analysis of melanic black. Commercial sepia melanin is purified according to an undescribed procedure. In this research, extraction and purification studies were carried out on sepia melanin using a hydrochloric acid (0. 5 - 3. 0 M) treatment under <b>mechanical</b> or ultrasonic <b>agitation.</b> A high degree purity sepia melanin was obtained and further characterized using Elemental Analysis (EA), Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-VIS) and Infrared (IR) spectroscopy and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) for metal ion analysis.

40|$|Two {{different}} routes, namely solvent aided dispersion {{and direct}} mixing, {{were employed to}} disperse Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWNTs) into a mono-component epoxy system used as matrix for advanced composites. In the first route, MWCNTs were diluted in three different solvents (acetone, sodium dodecyl sulfate and ethanol) and then mixed with the matrix by tip sonication. In the second case, carbonaceous nanoparticles were added directly into the hosting system and dispersion {{was carried out by}} using three different techniques (<b>mechanical</b> stirring, magnetic <b>agitation</b> and tip sonication). The effects of the solvents and agitation energy were investigated by optical microscopy at micron level, in order assess the more efficient dispersion procedure for the considered epoxy system. It was demonstrated that parameters associated with direct mixing rather than solvent solubility govern MWCNT dispersion. Optical analysis of the nanocomposite morphology evidenced a very low density of MWCNTs micron sized aggregates in the case of direct mixed tip sonicated samples if compared to those obtained by solution aided dispersion. In addition, nanocomposites obtained by sonication showed the lowest density of MWCNTs micron sized aggregates, also when compared with mechanically and magnetically stirred system. Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) and Thermo-Mechanical Analysis (TMA) results confirm the final result that among the considered direct mixing techniques, the direct tip sonication represents the most efficient route for MWCNT dispersion. Moreover, the mixing temperature of the hosting matrix system represents a fundamental feature in enhancing the MWCNT de-bundling and dispersion.
