40|$|Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) {{conducted}} an comprehensive literature review of actual reactor decontamination {{processes that are}} currently available. In general, any decontamination process {{should be based on}} the following criteria: effectiveness, efficiency, safety, and waste production. The information that was collected and analyzed has been divided into three major categories of decontamination: chemical, mechanical, and electrochemical. Chemical methods can be further classified as either low-concentration, singlestep processes or high-concentration, single- or multistep processes. Numerous chemical decontamination methods are detailed. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>decontamination</b> methods are usually restricted to the removal of a contaminated surface layer, whlch limits their versatility; several <b>mechanical</b> <b>decontamination</b> methods are described. Electrochemical decontamination. is both fast and easily controlled, and numerous processes that have been used in industry for many years are discussed. Information obtained from this work is tabulated in Appendix A for easy access, and a bibliography and a glossary have been provided...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{contains}} {{a review of}} the data relevant to the technologies and some results of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>decontamination</b> of the ground and buildings located at the territory of two recreational areas in the Bryansk Region. Both areas were significantly contaminated by the Chernobyl debris in 1986. The obtained values of the gamma-dose rate reduction factor were about 0. 2 and 0. 3 for the outdoor and indoor locations, respectively. The follow-up monitoring of the treated and control areas demonstrated long-term stability of the effect of the decontamination carried out...|$|E
40|$|Results for {{the direct}} {{determination}} of trace amounts of Pb and Cd in Antarctic and Greenland ancient ice and recent snow by laser-excited atomic fluorescence spectrometry (LEAFS) are presented. The whole procedure starting from field sampling, <b>mechanical</b> <b>decontamination</b> {{of the samples}} in an ultra-clean laboratory and final analysis of the decontaminated samples is described. The measured concentrations varied in the ranges 0. 1 – 3 pg ml^(– 1) for Cd and 0. 3 – 30 pg ml^(– 1) for Pb. The results for direct analysis by LEAFS agree favourable with those obtained by isotope dilution mass spectrometry and electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry, which require time-consuming pre-treatment and pre-concentration stages...|$|E

30|$|The primary outcome {{variable}} {{was the difference}} in anaerobic bacterial load of the implant surface before and after mechanical and chemical debridement and decontamination. After flap deflection and granulation tissue removal, a sample {{was obtained from the}} implant surface by rubbing a sterilized brush (Microbrush® International, Grafton, WI, USA) across the implant surface (Tpre). A second sample was obtained after <b>mechanical</b> debridement, <b>decontamination</b> of the implant surface with the test or control substance, and subsequent rinsing with sterile saline (Tpost). After sampling, the top part of the brush was cut off and collected in a vial containing reduced transport fluid [33]. From every implant presenting peri-implantitis, separate samples were obtained. All microbiological samples were processed within 24  h [34]. The total anaerobic bacterial load and the presence and numbers of the periodontal pathogens [35] Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, and Campylobacter rectus were determined by laboratory technicians who were blind to treatment allocation.|$|R
30|$|The main {{strengths}} {{of our study}} are that we considered direct medical costs and that we performed sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the results. The main limitation is {{that we did not}} assess the effectiveness of the single-use scopes and that the choice of fibrescopes was appreciated by operators. A review of the literature indicates that {{further research is needed to}} assess the effectiveness of disposable scopes in daily practice [6 – 9, 16]. It is also important to measure bronchoscope failure rates and the medical consequences of failure on effectiveness and direct medical costs. We considered the limitation noted by Tvede et al. [12] in their measurement of the break-even point regarding the actual need for the device. However, we did not consider opportunity costs associated with decontamination by auxiliary nurses and automatic annual microbiological samples. Indeed, time spent for decontamination procedures can be reassigned to patient care. The costs were considered with manual decontamination procedures, but they could be determined equally in case of <b>mechanical</b> centralized <b>decontamination</b> procedures. Another limitation was that BAL was not performed with single-use fiberscope, because the two first generation have not operator channel and then use of them was not validated by the pharmacy for BAL.|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} {{investigation}} is {{development of a}} new method of producing fibrous plates from 100 -percent precipitate after <b>mechanical</b> <b>decontamination</b> of waste waters resulting from production of paper and pulp. The researchers have pioneered in studying the physico-chemical, structural and mechanical properties of the precipitate, classifying the precipitate, developing a new method of investigating the filtration properties of precipitates contained in waste waters discharged from paper and pulp plants, determining the optimum methods of intensification of the filtration process and establishing the correlation relationship between the precipitate properties and the physico-mechanical characteristics of fibrous plates. They have determined the ortimal parameters of the process of moulding and hot pressing and developed a new method of utilization of substandard raw materials. The obtained results have been promoted at the "Svyatogorsk" production corporation, St-Petersbourg cardboard-producing and polygraphic integrated works, Kamensk cardboard factory, etc. The said product may find application as a heat-insulating, sound-proofing and constructional materials in the sphere of smale-scale industrial construction and civil engineeringAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report was to {{identify}} and evaluate alternatives for the decontamination of the RSM stainless steel that will {{be removed from the}} Idaho Chemical Processing plant (ICPP) fuel storage area (FSA) located in the FAST (CPP- 666) building, and to recommend decontamination alternatives for treating this material. Upon the completion of a literature search, the review of the pertinent literature, and based on the review of a variety of chemical, mechanical, and compound (both chemical and <b>mechanical)</b> <b>decontamination</b> techniques, the preliminary results of analyses of FSA critically barrier contaminants, and the data collected during the FSA Reracking project, it was concluded that decontamination and beneficial recycle of the FSA stainless steel produced is technically feasible and likely to be cost effective as compared to burying the material at the RWMC. It is recommended that an organic acid, or commercial product containing an organic acid, be used to decontaminate the FSA stainless steel; however, it is also recommended that other surface decontamination methods be tested in the event that this method proves unsuitable. Among the techniques that should be investigated are mechanical techniques (CO{sub 2 } pellet blasting and ultra-high pressure water blasting) and chemical techniques that are compatible with present ICPP waste streams...|$|E
30|$|The {{mainstay}} {{treatment for}} peri-implantitis includes {{the elimination of}} etiologic factors and the mechanical removal of calculus, cement, and plaque followed by subgingival irrigation with tetracycline and chlorhexidine base mouthwash. Lang et al. first described a treatment protocol for peri-implantitis including <b>mechanical</b> cleaning, <b>decontamination</b> of the implant surface, antibiotic regimen, and regenerative surgery (if required) in 1997 [10]. However, literate indicates {{that the use of}} air-powder abrasive (APA) treatment for the decontamination of the implant surface remains controversial. Although some reports advocate that the in vivo usage of APA systems pose a potential risk of emphysema and may have limited clinical applications [11, 12], some other studies, such as the study reported by Duarte et al. found that APA is more effective in the decontamination of dental implants than lasers, metal curettes, and plastic curettes [13]. On the other hand, Renvert et al. compared the use of APA and Er:YAG laser application on dental implant surfaces and found that the two methods produced similar outcomes with regards to the decontamination of implant surfaces. In the present study, we used a combination of APA and citric acid for the decontamination of the surfaces of the retrieved implants, mainly because both methods are easily available, have minimal cost, and are easy to use when compared to laser treatment [14].|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to analyse the planktonic growth of Streptococcus mutans on the {{surfaces}} of three implants retrieved after three different peri-implantitis treatments. Three implants from a male patient with high levels of bone loss were treated by <b>mechanical</b> debridement, chemical <b>decontamination,</b> and implantoplasty. After 4 months of follow-up, the implants were removed. The growth and biofilm formation were measured by spectrophotometry (OD 630 [*]nm) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), after 48 hours of incubation. Results showed an average of Streptococcus mutans planktonic growth over the implants of 0. 21 [*]nm (mechanical debridement), 0. 16 [*]nm (chemical decontamination), and 0. 15 [*]nm (implantoplasty). Data were analysed by ANOVA and Tukey’s test (p< 0. 05 for chemical decontamination and implantoplasty). Implantoplasty and chemical decontamination showed the lowest levels of planktonic growth, indicating a possible influence of the modification procedures on the titanium surface on the initial biofilm attachment...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{review the}} {{literature}} on decontamination of titanium implant surfaces following peri-implantitis {{and the effect of}} various cleaning methods on re-osseointegration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic search of the literature at PubMed was conducted on the studies published between 1966 and October 2010. In vitro, animal, and clinical studies were included. RESULTS: Of 597 studies retrieved, 74 manuscripts were selected for the review. Various implant surface decontamination methods using various chemical and mechanical agents have been suggested for treatment and re-osseointegration following periimplantitis. It has been shown that re-osseointegration of contaminated implant surfaces is possible; this largely depends upon the surface of the implant and the types of decontamination techniques and bone regenerative materials used. Complete re-osseointegration cannot be achieved by surface decontamination alone. Titanium implants with titanium plasma-sprayed or sandblasted and acid-etched surfaces may be effectively decontaminated by applying chlorhexidine and saline-soaked gauze or by repeated rinsing with these solutions. CONCLUSIONS: Both <b>mechanical</b> and chemical <b>decontamination</b> techniques should be applied alongside regenerative surgical procedures to obtain optimum re-osseointegration and successfully treat peri-implantitis. In recent years, lasers and photodynamic therapy have shown minor beneficial results, which need to be confirmed by long-term clinical studies with comparable groups...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present case report was to {{describe}} the surgical treatment of a peri-implantitis lesion associated with a regenerative approach. A 48 -year-old patient came to authors’ attention 36 months after the placement of a dental implant (ITI-Bonefit Straumann, Waldenburg, Switzerland) in position 46. A swelling of the peri-implant soft tissues was observed, associated with bleeding on probing and probing depth > 10 [*]mm. A significant peri-implant bone loss was clearly visible on the periapical radiograph. A nonsurgical periodontal supportive therapy was firstly conducted to reduce the inflammation, followed by the surgical treatment of the defect. After <b>mechanical</b> and chemical <b>decontamination</b> with tetracycline solution, a regenerative approach consisting in the application of deproteinized bovine bone mineral (Bio-Oss, Geistlich Pharma AG, Wolhusen, Switzerland) and a collagen membrane (Bio-Gide, Geistlich Pharma AG, Wolhusen, Switzerland) was performed. An antibiotic therapy was associated with the treatment. The 17 -year follow-up showed a physiological probing depth with no clinical signs of peri-implant inflammation and bleeding on probing. No further radiographic bone loss was observed. The treatment described in the present case report seemed to show improved clinical results up to a relevant follow-up period...|$|R
5000|$|Contamination control {{products}} {{have been used}} by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the commercial nuclear industry for decades to minimize contamination on radioactive equipment and surfaces and fix contamination in place. “Contamination control products” is a broad term that includes fixatives, strippable coatings, and decontamination gels. A fixative product functions as a permanent coating to stabilize residual loose/transferable radioactive contamination by fixing it in place; this aids in preventing the spread of contamination and reduces the possibility of the contamination becoming airborne, reducing workforce exposure and facilitating future deactivation and decommissioning (D&D) activities. Strippable coating products are loosely adhered paint-like films and are used for their decontamination abilities. They are applied to surfaces with loose/transferable radioactive contamination and then, once dried, are peeled off, which removes the loose/transferable contamination along with the product. The residual radioactive contamination on the surface is significantly reduced once the strippable coating is removed. Modern strippable coatings show high decontamination efficiency and can rival traditional <b>mechanical</b> and chemical <b>decontamination</b> methods. Decontamination gels work {{in much the same way}} as other strippable coatings. The results obtained through the use of contamination control products is variable and depends on the type of substrate, the selected contamination control product, the contaminants, and the environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.).https://www.dndkm.org/DOEKMDocuments/library/Contamination%20Control%20Fixatives%20List.pdf ...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: Denture {{stomatitis}} {{results from}} colonization of oral Candida {{on the surface}} of denture acrylic base. To control this infection,Candida biofilm formation must be prevented using <b>mechanical</b> and chemical <b>decontamination.</b> The {{purpose of the present study}} was to evaluate the effect of Amylase, Papaein and Pepsin solutions on removal of Candida Albicans plaques formed on acrylic resin plates. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study Candida biofilm was formed on 220 acrylic resin plaques. The average attached Candida cells on 20 randomly selected plates were determined by staining of the plates with Crystal violet and observing them under an optical microscope. 200 contaminated plates were then randomly divided into 4 groups of 50, immersed in 100 µg/ml Amylase, Pepsin, and Papain enzyme solutions as test groups, as well as sterile distilled water as negative control group. They were kept in solutions for 8 hours in room temperature. The mean attached Candida cells were determined and data was analyzed using ANOVA and T- test using SPSS software. Results: The average Candida cells attached on to acrylic resin plates on each visual field after decontamintion with Papain solutions was 2. 39 ± 0. 76, Pepsin 7. 14 ± 1. 47 followed by Amylase 8. 22 ± 1. 29, but it was 9. 66 ± 1. 54 in negative control group. The results showed significant differences (P= 0. 001). Papain enzyme cleaned 78. 9 % of attached Candida cells on acrylic resin plates, whereas Amylase showed minimum antimicrobial properties by removing only 27. 4 % of attached Candida cells. Conclusion: Papain solution has maximum effect on removal of Candida from acrylic resin platesKey word: Acrylic Resin; Pepsin; Biofil...|$|R
40|$|A liquid chromatography/electrospray {{ionization}} tandem {{mass spectrometry}} (LC/ESI-MS/MS) method {{has been developed}} {{for the analysis of}} bulprenorphine (BLIP) and nor-buprenorphine (NBUP) in biological fluids. Analytes are isolated from urine and blood, after addition of d(4) -buprenorphine (d(4) -BUP) as internal standard, by solid-phase extraction. Preparation of hair involves external <b>decontamination,</b> <b>mechanical</b> pulverization, overnight incubation in acidic medium, and neutralization prior to extraction. Enzymatic hydrolysis with P-glucuronidase may be performed to distinguish between free and total BLIP. Chromatographic separation is accomplished by gradient elution on a cyanopropyl 2. 1 X 150 mm, column. Positive ion ESI and MS analyses are carried out in an ion trap mass spectrometer. The use of this mass analyzer allows effective collisional experiments to be performed on ESI-generated MH+ species. Abundant product ions are produced, which can be monitored together with precursor ions without losing sensitivity. Thus, assay selectivity is definitely increased with respect to LC/ESI-MS/MS methods in which only precursor ions are monitored. The method has good linearity (calibration curves were linear in the range 0. 1 - 10 ng/mL in urine and blood, in the range 10 - 160 pg/mg in hair) and limits of detection of 0. 05 ng/mL for both BLIP and NBUT in blood and urine samples, of 4 pg/mg for both analytes in hair. Both intra- and inter-assay precision and accuracy were satisfactory at three concentrations studied: relative standard deviations were < 13. 7 % in urine, < 17. 3 % in blood, < 17. 8 % in hair; percent deviation of the mean from the true value was always < 10. 5 % in urine and blood, < 16. 1 % in hair. The method can be used to determine both analytes in the urine and hair of drug addicts on replacement therapy, and in post-mortem blood specimens when there is suspicion of drug-related death...|$|R
