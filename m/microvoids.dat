Such a state is usually achieved at high homologous temperature. Examples of superplastic materials are some fine-grained metals and ceramics. Other non-crystalline materials (amorphous) such as silica glass ("molten glass") and polymers also deform similarly, but are not called superplastic, {{because they are not}} crystalline; rather, their deformation is often described as Newtonian fluid.

50|$|Microscopic {{material}} {{failure is}} {{defined in terms of}} crack propagation and initiation. Such methodologies are useful for gaining insight in the cracking of specimens and simple structures under well defined global load distributions. Microscopic failure considers the initiation and propagation of a crack. Failure criteria in this case are related to microscopic fracture. Some of the most popular failure models in this area are the micromechanical failure models, which combine the advantages of continuum mechanics and classical fracture mechanics. Such models are based on the concept that during plastic deformation, <b>microvoids</b> nucleate and grow until a local plastic neck or fracture of the intervoid matrix occurs, which causes the coalescence of neighbouring voids. Such a model, proposed by Gurson and extended by Tvergaard and Needleman, is known as GTN. Another approach, proposed by Rousselier, is based on continuum damage mechanics (CDM) and thermodynamics. Both models form a modification of the von Mises yield potential by introducing a scalar damage quantity, which represents the void volume fraction of cavities, the porosity f.|$|E

These planar <b>microvoids</b> differ in size and density from the more common process voids that are found in solder joints. However, unlike the process voids, these planar <b>microvoids</b> reduce the reliability margin by accelerating crack propagation during thermal cycling.

There are no caves found in any of the conditions in the DOE, even for an extremely thick silver coating (more than 3 microns).

40|$|The {{influence}} of {{lead on the}} fracture behavior of aluminum alloy AA 6262 is investigated. Under certain conditions, the mode of fracture changes from transgranular <b>microvoid</b> coalescence to an intergranular mechanism. Three different intergranular fracture mechanisms are observed: liquid metal embrittlement, dynamic embrittlement at temperatures below the melting temperature of lead, and intergranular <b>microvoid</b> coalescence. An attempt is made to examine the dependence of these three mechanisms on temperature, strain rate, and stress state using in situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Liquid metal embrittlement occurs when the alloy is fractured at temperatures above the melting temperature of lead and at low strain rates. At lower temperatures, the occurrence of dynamic embrittlement depends largely on strain rate, stress state, and temperature. Intergranular <b>microvoid</b> coalescence is not often observed.

The influences of heat-treatment, drawing ratio and drawing temperature on melting behavior, crystalliza-tion, multi-pore-structure (MPS) and porosity were investigated. The {{results of this}} study demonstrated that the original crystal grains became more perfect and that new micro crystallites were produced through heat treatment. Defects were more easily formed by the micro crystallites in cold stretching. Heat treat-ment also made the pores contract. The MPS including TIPS pore, stretching pore and interfacial mi-crovoid was constructed after stretching. A model of interfacial <b>microvoid</b> was built. The model indicated that the area of interfacial <b>microvoid</b> increased as the drawing ratio became larger, reaching a maximum at a certain drawing ratio. Values above this maximum drawing ratio made no contribution to further in-crease the triangular area of interfacial <b>microvoid</b> but made many TIPS pores close. As the drawing ratio increased, the pore diameter (PD) and total pore fraction (TPF) of the stretched pores increased whereas the TPF of the TIPS pores decreased. The pore diameter distribution (PDD) and the porosity resulted from the joint effect of multiple pores. Without stretching, the porosity was slight due to the pores con-tracting, and it increased as the drawing ratio became larger, reaching a maximum at a drawing ratio of 5 times.

The loading step at which each microvoid was nucleated was identified by tracking the microvoid throughout tension, together with its nucleation site.

In {{order to}} study the damage {{mechanism}} under different stress states of aluminum alloy components, two kinds of representative triaxial stress states were adopted, namely notch tensile and pure shear.
