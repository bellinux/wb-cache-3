An open {{question is to}} ask about the minimum number of <b>measurement</b> <b>geometries</b> required to completely characterize their observed color shift. A recently published principal components analysis (PCA) -based procedure to estimate the color of special-effect coatings at any <b>geometry</b> from <b>measurements</b> at a reduced set of geometries was tested in this work by using the <b>measurement</b> <b>geometries</b> of commercial portable multiangle spectrophotometers X-Rite MA 98, Datacolor FX 10, and BYK-mac as reduced sets. The performance of the proposed PCA procedure for the color-shift estimation for these commercial geometries has been examined for 15 special-effect coatings. Our results suggest that for rendering the color appearance of 3 D objects covered with special-effect coatings, the color accuracy obtained with this procedure may be sufficient. This is the case especially if geometries of X-Rite MA 98 or Datacolor FX 10 are used.

Innumeracy has been seen in those suffering from poor education and childhood deprivation of numeracy.Innumeracy is apparent in children during the transition of numerical skills obtained before schooling and the new skills taught in the education departments because of their memory capacity to comprehend the material. Patterns of innumeracy have also been observed depending on age, gender, and race.Older adults {{have been associated with}} lower numeracy skills than younger adults. Men have been identified to have higher numeracy skills than women. [...] Some studies seem to indicate young people of African heritage tend to have lower numeracy skills. The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) in which children at fourth-grade (average 10 to 11 years) and eighth-grade (average 14 to 15 years) from 49 countries were tested on mathematical comprehension.

This scattering amplitude is a function of frequency and the angles and polarizations of the incident and scattered fields. The diffraction corrections are designed to allow results of measurements in complex geometries to be related to these unbounded medium scattering amplitudes...|$|E
