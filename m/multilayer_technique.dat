40|$|During {{the past}} decade, {{electrically}} conducting polymers have attracted considerable attention [1 - 3] {{because of their}} application potential for the electronics and biomaterials industry. Polypyrrole (PPy) {{is one of the}} most commonly used conducting polymers. The conductivity is invoked through incorporation (“doping”) of anions into the polymer matrix, leading to the formation of (bi) polarons. The stability of PPy films is a widely debated issue, and previous studies have largely focused on thermally induced ageing and its effects on the conductivity of the material [4 - 7]. In addition, degradation effects upon irradiation with soft X-rays have occasionally been reported (e. g. [4]). The ageing of PPy caused by irradiation with high energy photons is an equally significant topic of research. For instance, X-ray absorption spectroscopy at higher energies is attractive, because (i) transition metals, such as ruthenium, are important constituents of dopants for biomaterials applications, and (ii) PPy can be deposited on metal films, such as copper or stainless steel [8, 9].

Single-charge devices are sub-micrometer sized electronic circuits that use the fact that charge is quantized. Their main component is the tunnel junction, a resistive element that can be made as small as one nanometer. In the past, many different circuits have been fabricated with the tunnel junction such as ultra-sensitive electrometers. To actually fabricate logical gates and memory, a multi-layer technology is required to couple the circuit elements. We developped a special multi-layer technology, using heavily oxidized aluminum gates. With this new technique it was possible to make a memory cell, where information was coded as {{the presence or absence of}} a single electron. Also a logic inverter was fabricated with voltage gain. As another example of the performance of this <b>multilayer</b> <b>technique,</b> an on-chip frequency generator was coupled to a single-electron transistor. By measuring the photo-response of the single-electron transistor, it could be estimated that 75 % of the generated signal was coupled through.

The technique has been used to couple various single-charge devices, demonstrating the feasibility of even more complex single-charge devices. Applied Science...|$|E

Ordinary ISO sheets and freely dried sheets were manufactured from these pulp samples to serve as reference sheets. The laboratory sheets made of pulp from the pressurized system had a higher strain at break and tensile energy adsorption index but a lower tensile index than sheets made of pulp from a conventional atmospheric highconsistency refiner. These sheets were subject to a polyelectrolyte multilayer treatment to increase {{the interaction between the}} fibres, thus enhancing the paper strength properties.

40|$|In this research, novel meta {{material}} structures {{based on}} microstrip integrated circuit technology {{have been investigated}} for filter application {{in the next generation}} of microwave wireless communication systems. A number of novel microstrip planar filter structures have been developed that are able to meet the stringent requirements for high-performance systems and subsystems, such as sharp-cutoff frequency response, low passband insertion-loss and high return-Joss, high out-af-band rejection, compact size, low cost and ease of integration. The filters are approximately 70 % smaller than their conventional counterparts. Analysis and mathematical modeling of these microstrip devices involved the use of transmission-line theory and EM simulation tools which were based on the method of moments and finite element analyses. Measured results were used to validate the predicted behavior and performance of these devices. In fact there was good agreement with the theory and simulation modeling. A Composite right/left-handed (CRLH) metamaterial unit-cell whose ground-plane is defected with a rectangular dielectric slot was used to develop a single and multi-pole bandpass filters. The unit-cell comprises of serial inter-digital capacitors whose junction is connected to a short-circuited inductive stub. By defecting the ground-plane of the unit-cell 's structure with a dielectric slot, which is located immediately below the unit-cell, enables substantial tuning of the filter's centre frequency in the order of 26. 5 %. This was achieved with minimal effect on the unitcell's insertion- and return-loss performance as well as its selectivity. The filters were fabricated on conventional dielectric substrate and their performance measured to verify the design methodology. The proposed technique eases the trade-off constraints that plague conventional filter designs and makes possible the realization of challenging filter specifications constituted from CRLH unit-cells using distributed transmission-lines. A novel <b>multilayer</b> <b>technique</b> is presented that enables (i) the control of the filter's bandwidth, (ii) significantly improves its passband selectivity, and (iii) enhances its out-of-band rejection without affecting the filter's overall dimensions. The technique involves implementation of identical filter structures {{on both sides of the}} dielectric substrate that are interconnected through vias. The filter circuit is laid on top of another identical substrate with a ground-plane. This structure results in a device that exhibits a sharp selectivity that is substantially smaller than traditional filter constructions. The sharpness of the filter is due to the upper and lower transmission zeros present on either side of the filter's passband being shifted closer together which causes reduction in its bandwidth. This effect is opposite to that encountered in conventional multilayer filter structures. It is shown the filter's bandwidth can be controlled while maintaining a good passband insertion- and return-loss performance, i. e. 10 dB, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed filter is relatively easy to fabricate using conventional technology. A diplexer was developed based on the proposed <b>multilayer</b> <b>technique</b> and was shown to yield a high out-af-band rejection and high isolation between the two very closely spaced channels. Normally isolators are used to provide isolation between channels in order to prevent inter-channel interference. The technique is relatively simple to realize and cost effective to manufacture. Design methodology and experimental results are presented that show good correlation between the measured and simulation results. This diplexer should find application in multi band wireless communication systems. A triplexer deSign is also presented whose multiband performance was created using CRLH unit-cell structures. The three passband channels of the triplexer have a common input splitter and transmission-line matching network is used to ensure high isolation between the channels is maintained in order to prevent undesired interaction between the channels which would otherwise adversely affect the triplexer's passband response. This was achieved using stepped impedance lines (SIL). No isolators were necessary using the proposed technique. It is also shown that by curving the SIL can provide enhancement in the triplexer's loss performance, bandwidth, and suppression of high order spurii. The design analysis and performance of the triplexer was verified via fabrication and measurement. A novel compact microstrip wideband bandpass filter was presented for wideband application that possesses good insertion- and return-loss, sharp frequency selectivity and high out-of-band rejection. The proposed filter comprises of two inter-digital capacitors with four inductive stubs. It employs a T-shaped open stub that is inserted between the symmetrical unitcell structures.

The aim of this thesis work was to use the two techniques mentioned above and to optimize {{them in order to}} produce a paper with both high tensile index and strain at break. In this study high consistency refined pulp from an atmospheric and a pressurized refiner was low consistency refined in an Escher-Wyss laboratory refiner to a SR-number between 17, 5 - 20, 5. Ordinary ISO-sheets and freely dried sheets were manufactured from those pulp samples. The laboratory sheets made from pulp samples from the pressurized system had higher strain at break and tensile energy adsorption index but lower tensile index compared to sheets from the pulp sample refined in a conventional atmospheric high consistency system. ISO-sheets and freely dried sheets were also made from refined pulp samples whose fibres had been coated with one or three layers of polymer. Polyelectrolyte multilayers were built by sequential provision of anionic starch and cationic CMC. Three different stock preparation strategies were used for the provision of polymer. Adsorption equilibrium was determined indirectly by charge titration of non-adsorbed polyelectrolyte in a particle charge detector. Physical paper properties of the sheets showed that the addition of only one layer of starch increased strain at break, tensile index, tensile energy adsorption index and Scott-Bond significantly.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} a tremendous growth {{of research and}} development to provide mobile users with "seamless" communication through wireless media. Service provision in mobile networks is closely intertwined with network mobility management and therefore efficient management of subscriber mobility remains a challenging and an important area of research. This thesis examines management of signalling traffic in mobile networks and packet network design approaches, with specific contributions relating to i) reduction of network database signalling costs in GSM; ii) minimization of mobility signalling over the air-interface based a new technique for subscriber location management; iii) an efficient network design technique for packet communication networks with application to GPRS, based on a novel hybrid GA-Heuristic approach. A novel location management technique is proposed to reduce signalling costs in the core network, by reducing the rate of HLR-related transactions. By intelligent distribution of the HLR related signalling over a number of VLRs, the HLR is prevented from being a potential bottleneck and a single point of failure in the signalling network. Based on the analytical model developed, it is demonstrated that within the call-to-mobility range considered, the total network signalling cost as well as location management costs can be significantly reduced, compared to current strategy adopted in GSM, To address location management signalling in the access network, a number of dynamic schemes are considered and compared with the proposed adaptive <b>multilayer</b> <b>technique.</b> Through detailed simulations under various scenarios, the superiority of the proposed scheme, in terms of significant savings in the total signalling traffic (i. e. location update and paging) and ease of implementation, compared to other techniques is demonstrated. The location management scheme of GSM is used as baseline for comparisons. Finally, efficient design of packet communication networks, with application to GPRS backbone architecture, is addressed. To meet the cost and traffic requirements whilst ensuring that the delay and reliability constraints are also satisfied, a hybrid GA-heuristic approach is developed as an alternative to purely GA based and heuristic-only approaches. Under a common set of parameters, the performance of various techniques are compared and it is shown that the hybrid approach is capable of producing solutions that are superior to other typical network design methods...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The rising {{demand for}} {{aesthetic}} adhesive restorations {{has led to}} the wide use of composites. <b>Multilayer</b> <b>techniques</b> are recommended for the success of these restorations. However, this technique of layering causes the problem of interlayer adhesion, thus supporting the influence of the oxygen-inhibited layer. This study sought to test the hypothesis that the oxygen-inhibited layer increases the shear bond strength of composite resin by allowing the resins on both sides to cross the interface and form an interdiffusion zone. Materials and Methods: A microhybrid composite resin, Charisma, and a nanofill composite resin, Solare, were used in this study. Cylindrical specimens of the composites of 5 mm diameter and 6 mm height were prepared and embedded in acrylic resin moulds after curing. Curing was done in an argon atmosphere to prevent the formation of the oxygen-inhibited layer. To clinically simulate an inert atmosphere, a cellophane matrix strip was used during the process of curing. Results: Shear bond strength of the specimens was tested using a universal testing machine and the results were tabulated and statistically analyzed...|$|R
40|$|By {{alternate}} {{deposition of}} Fe and Mg in ultra high vacuum atmosphere, multilayered films with artificial superstructure were prepared. Fe and Mg are insoluble {{even in the}} liquid states (so-called two melt system), nevertheless, artificial superlattices with very short periodicity were established. The superstructure is confirmed by X-ray diffraction. An example of the X-ray pattern is shown below. The higher order reflections indicate the compositional modulation of a square wave mode. Magnetic properties were studied by means of Mössbauer spectroscopy. When the Fe layer thickness is less than 10 Å, no hyperfine field was observed at 300 K. It seems the magnetization is spatially unstable due to a thermal agitation. At 4. 2 K, a six-line pattern was observed and all the Fe atoms, including those at the interface sites, have local magnetic moments. The success to compose artificial superlattices in such a dissimilar combination as Fe and Mg suggests that the <b>multilayering</b> <b>technique</b> is a very promising method to produce new materials which can {{not exist in the}} thermal equilibrium states...|$|R
40|$|Extrapolation of PbTe/II-VI <b>multilayer</b> interference-filter <b>technique</b> from 20 to beyond 40 µm is {{described}} and PbTe transparency reviewed; improvements below 20 µm are reported. A composite filter cutting on steeply at 40 µm {{is described}} that uses absorptive films of ZnS and As 2 S 3, thin Quartz, and supplementary multilayer interference. Absorptive filters are described containing the II-VI compounds since these are found transparent at wavelengths shorter and longer than their reststrahl. ...|$|R
