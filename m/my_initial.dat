In an interview with The Times of India Kapoor commented, [...] "In <b>my</b> <b>initial</b> years in the industry, I pushed myself {{to do a lot of}} work because I was greedy. I did some films—which I now regret—purely for the money. Today, I want to do selective films." [...] Later that year, she appeared briefly in one of the year's biggest hits, the Farhan Akhtar action-thriller Don (a remake of the 1978 film of the same name).|$|E

These fears were also shared by James who revealed that the front rows of the gigs that the band were performing at during the Britpop years were primarily attracting 15-year-old girls and that he thought the change in style was a [...] "fucking big balls move." [...] Andy Ross, who was running Food Records at the time, admitted that when he first heard it he was [...] "taken aback. We'd won Brits, we'd won two consecutive Q magazine Albums of the Year and <b>my</b> <b>initial</b> reaction was it's awkward and difficult. My immediate reaction was will you sell as many records? Where's my royalties? Everyone's first reaction to it {{was that it was}} a departure: that’s clear from the artwork onwards." ...|$|E

500|$|Within {{months of}} the novel's release, {{computer}} gaming company I-Play began developing a downloadable casual-play game based on the story. [...] Roberts' input was limited to approval of the graphics and the game's interpretation of the story line. [...] The game followed the general plot of the novel, {{from the perspective of}} the heroine. [...] More than 40 different locations from the book were featured, including Mac's office and Carter's kitchen. [...] There were hidden-object tasks and several mini-games featuring wedding-related activities, such as cake decorating and floral arranging. [...] Roberts was pleased with the final product, remarking that [...] "to have a story translated into a game like this, it's tremendous fun for me. It's <b>my</b> <b>initial</b> vision, but I enjoy seeing how, when you translate it into that other medium, how somebody else's vision manages to affect it but keep the core of the story." [...] The game was released in February 2010. [...] According to Roberts' website, game sales did not match the developer's expectations, and plans for sequels to the game were cancelled.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reactions}} of the episode were positive. Chris Carabott of IGN rated the episode 9 out of 10, calling it [...] "a swift return to form" [...] with [...] "plenty of striking and emotional moments" [...] that made {{it one of the}} better episodes of the first season. Carabott commented on the flashbacks; [...] "We don't necessarily learn anything new about Jack from a personality standpoint," [...] but Fox did [...] "an exceptional job of conveying Jack's heartbreak as he reveals that his father operated on a woman while under the influence of alcohol." [...] He enjoyed Jack and Ethan's encounter, calling it [...] "chilling." [...] Carabott also praised the scene where Jack tries to save Charlie; [...] "I remember believing that they had killed off Charlie on <b>my</b> <b>initial</b> viewing and even though I knew the outcome this time, it was still a hard scene to watch," [...] adding [...] "after Jack finally manages to resuscitate him, you have to feel for Charlie because you know that he's disappointed in himself for letting Claire down."

500|$|The {{search for}} a new guitarist and drummer began with {{advertisements}} placed in copies of Melody Maker. The invitation was spotted by drummer Phil Collins, formerly of Flaming Youth who already knew Stratton-Smith. He recalled, [...] "My only knowledge of Genesis was through seeing the ads for their gigs. It seemed like they were constantly working. ... I thought 'At least I'm going to be working if I get the gig'." [...] Roger Taylor, subsequently of Queen, turned down an invitation to audition. Collins went to the audition at Gabriel's parents' house in Chobham, Surrey with his Flaming Youth band mate, guitarist Ronnie Caryl. As they arrived early, Collins took a swim in the pool and heard what the other drummers were playing. [...] "They put on 'Trespass', and <b>my</b> <b>initial</b> impression of a very soft and round music, not edgy, with vocal harmonies and I came away thinking Crosby, Stills and Nash". Gabriel and Rutherford noticed the confident way Collins approached and sat at his drum kit and knew he would be the right replacement. Banks said, [...] "It was a combination of things. He could make it swing a little bit ... he could also tell good jokes and make us laugh ... And he could sing, which was an advantage because Mike and I were not very good at back-up vocals". In August 1970, Collins became the new drummer for Genesis. Caryl's audition was unsuccessful; Rutherford thought he was not the player the group were looking for.|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Born This Way, season ten American Idol {{contestant}} Haley Reinhart sang [...] "You and I" [...] as one of two performances for the [...] "Songs from Now and Then" [...] episode. Jimmy Iovine, head of Gaga's record label, asked for the song and Reinhart received her permission before the performance. Reviews of Reinhart's performance were mostly positive. Len Melisurgo of The Star-Ledger considered it a risky choice, since the song had not been released, but accepted that Reinhart [...] "sounded amazing" [...] by hitting [...] "some really high notes". Brian Mansfield of USA Today described Reinhart's performance as an [...] "old-fashioned dance-hall groove, kind of like a mid-'70s Elton John number. It's perfectly suited to that slippery growl that such a distinctive part of Haley's style. By the end of the song, she turns it into a gospel-style rocker, and she takes it to the house." [...] Mansfield also noted that the American Idol judges—Randy Jackson, Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler—reacted positively to it. On the contrary, Jim Farber of the New York Daily News considered the choice risky and was thankful when Reinhart performed a more familiar song for her second round. On May 5, 2011, Reinhart's studio recording of [...] "You and I" [...] was released as a digital single to the iTunes Store, and appeared on the compilation album American Idol Top 5 Season 10. Mansfield, who initially had misgivings about Reinhart as a singer, complimented her studio recording of the track, feeling that if she could [...] "get another 10 songs this good {{when it comes time to}} cut the record, then all <b>my</b> <b>initial</b> misgivings about this girl will vanish into thin air." ...|$|E

The money would pay visiting professors and a program {{coordinator}} for conferences, guest speakers and other events. Kramer agreed to leave his literary papers and those chronicling the AIDS movement and his founding of GMHC and ACT-UP to Yale's Beinecke Library. [...] "A lot has changed since I made <b>my</b> <b>initial</b> demands," [...] said Kramer. [...] "I was trying to cram stuff down their throat. I'd rather they fashion their own stuff.

Emily soon began to suffer from breast cancer, and died three years into their marriage. Prior to Emily's death, Wain discovered the subject that would define his career. During her illness, Emily was comforted by their pet cat Peter, a stray black and white kitten they had rescued after hearing him mewing in the rain one night. Emily's spirits were greatly lifted by Peter, and Louis began to draw extensive sketches of him, which Emily strongly encouraged him to have published. She died before this happened, but he continued to make cat sketches. He later wrote of Peter, [...] "To him, properly, belongs the foundation of my career, the developments of <b>my</b> <b>initial</b> efforts, and the establishing of my work."

The poll appeared to show that 8 out of 10 businesses backed Britain's continued membership of the EU. Vote Leave claimed that the poll was [...] "wholly unrepresentative" [...] of Britain's businesses due to skewed sampling in the poll and alleged that the research had [...] "caused the public to be misled about the views of British businesses on the EU for nearly two years." [...] The British Polling Council's formal response concluded that YouGov had [...] "not provided an adequate explanation of the sampling procedures {{that had been used}} to conduct the survey" [...] at the time of publishing the survey, whilst a leaked email sent in response to the initial complaint by Nick Moon, secretary of the British Polling Council, stated: “Survey looks pretty dodgy but luckily we don’t need to rule on that. But <b>my</b> <b>initial</b> thought is that YouGov did not give as much info as they should have.” Vote Leave described the CBI as the [...] "Voice of Brussels" [...] and also published research allegedly showing that the CBI had received over £1million in funding from the EU over the previous six years.|$|E

So I didn't change my mind {{on the question of whether}} we had established all the key facts that related to Coach Paterno's involvement and/or responsibility. But I had reached the conclusion that, from the standpoint of what the University's values would be interpreted to be by the broader public, that what was known was sufficiently serious as it relates to child sexual abuse that it would send the wrong message about our values as a University if Coach Paterno were allowed to coach as though none of this had ever happened." ...|$|E

I didn't like at all the attention that came with being on such a high-profile show. It simply wasn't what I signed up for in the first place-all that craziness. I was naive, I admit. Of course it does come with the job of being on the show and {{you have to learn to}} deal with it and cope with it. The advantages always outweigh the drawbacks, anyway, but it didn't seem like that to me at the time. I was very young and extremely shy, so it all became a huge difficulty for me…But I also have to make it clear that from the beginning when I joined, I always intended to stay in it for just a year anyway. I honoured <b>my</b> <b>initial</b> one-year contract and then moved on…they did express their interest in signing me for another year, but I politely but firmly declined. They were a bit shocked. I tried to explain in the best way I could my reasons for leaving at the end of my contract and they ultimately understood, and so I left on good terms with them…I had some growing up to do and instinctively knew that growing up more or less in front of the British public for one year was enough!” ...|$|E
