Amorphous metal wires have been produced by sputtering molten metal onto a spinning metal disk. More recently a number of alloys have been produced in layers with thickness exceeding 1 millimeter.

40|$|Novel {{thermoplastic}} bonding using bulk <b>metallic</b> <b>glass</b> solder A novel thermoplastic bonding {{concept is}} demonstrated {{based on the}} unique rheological behavior and pattern-replication ability of bulk <b>metallic</b> <b>glass</b> forming liquids. In this approach, the bulk <b>metallic</b> <b>glass</b> is heated above Tg to the “supercooled liquid ” region while a small normal {{force is applied to}} the joint.
