5|$|In August 1863, {{as part of}} {{his duties}} as aide-de-camp to General Barnard, Alexander was named {{as a member of a}} board of {{military}} officers who would examine the defenses of Washington and suggest improvements as needed. The board, created by the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton, was designed to replace a civilian board that he had created in 1862. In a November 1863 <b>meeting,</b> <b>this</b> board recommended final allotments of guns and ammunition for the forts protecting Washington, D.C., thus establishing the number of guns that would be in place during the Battle of Fort Stevens eight months later.|$|E

5|$|Responsibility for the {{development}} and testing of the critical detonators was shared between Lauritsen's group at Caltech and Robert Henderson's group at Los Alamos. By mid-1945, the object was to produce 1,000 detonators each week. <b>Meeting</b> <b>this</b> target proved challenging. Reliability was the key problem, with initial batches containing unacceptably high numbers of failures. In May 1945, a box of detonators manufactured by Raytheon fell from a truck and tumbled down a mountain side, but were found to still be in working order.|$|E

5|$|The XR-1, {{having been}} {{repaired}} in the meantime, {{was once again}} flying, and a contract had been awarded to Platt-Lepage {{for the construction of}} seven pre-production aircraft, to be built to an improved version of the XR-1A design, and designated YR-1A. Motivated by Congressional concerns about potential favouritism towards Sikorsky Aircraft, which had in the meantime been given a contract for development of an improved version of their VS-300 experimental helicopter, the contract called for delivery of the first YR-1A to the Army in January 1945. However, due to continued financial and flight-testing problems, Platt-Lepage proved incapable of <b>meeting</b> <b>this</b> schedule.|$|E
5|$|Yugoslav naval {{policy in}} the interwar period lacked {{direction}} until the mid-1920s, although it was generally accepted that the Adriatic coastline was effectively a sea frontier that the naval arm was responsible for securing with the limited resources made available to it. In 1926, a modest ten-year construction program was initiated to build up a force of submarines, coastal torpedo boats, torpedo bombers and conventional bomber aircraft to perform this role. The Hrabri-class submarines were one of the first new acquisitions aimed at developing a naval force capable of <b>meeting</b> <b>this</b> challenge.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{originally}} {{announced that}} users {{who did not}} install the update would not receive any other updates after May 13, 2014. However, <b>meeting</b> <b>this</b> deadline proved challenging: The ability to deploy Windows 8.1 Update through Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) was disabled shortly after its release following {{the discovery of a}} bug which affects the ability to use WSUS as a whole in certain server configurations. Microsoft later fixed the issue but users continued to report that the update may fail to install. Microsoft's attempt to fix the problem was ineffective, to the point that Microsoft pushed the support deadline further to June 30, 2014. On 16 May, Microsoft released additional updates to fix a problem of BSOD in the update.|$|E

5|$|The Grand Fleet {{conducted}} a sweep {{into the central}} North Sea on 1719 May without encountering any German vessels. On 25 May, Iron Duke carried Jellicoe to Rosyth to meet with Admiral Henry Jackson, the new First Sea Lord. Iron Duke returned to Scapa Flow on 28 May, in time to participate in another sweep into the North Sea on 2931 May. After returning to Scapa Flow, Iron Duke immediately departed for Cromarty. The fleet conducted gunnery training in mid-June. Iron Duke, the 2nd Battle Squadron, and the 1st Cruiser Squadron conducted gunnery training at Cromarty on 2 August; after completing the drills, the ships returned to Scapa Flow. On 7 August, the ship again took Jellicoe to Cromarty for another <b>meeting,</b> <b>this</b> time with the Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith. Iron Duke was back in Scapa Flow by 16 August.|$|E

25|$|This {{motion was}} later {{withdrawn}} due to McQueen's powers of persuasion. However, McQueen's problems were not over. Council moved {{to reduce his}} authority by insisting that he produce a Principal's report for each Council <b>meeting.</b> <b>This</b> also highlighted Gillespie's {{lack of confidence in}} him as this had never before been the practice at Croydon, nor was it the case at Gillespie's other school, Knox Grammar School.

25|$|In July 1910 Germans in Omaha rallied {{with other}} {{immigrant}} organizations {{across the city}} to create the National German-American Alliance. At least 54 social, farming and cultural organizations from around Omaha were represented at the first <b>meeting.</b> <b>This</b> alliance brought together many German organizations around Omaha in July 1911 at the city's annual SÃ¤ngerfest, which was a dance and rally for more than 5,000 attendees. By masking political objectives within a German cultural event, National German-American Alliance leaders were able to openly politicize the event without scrutiny from the mainstream press.|$|E
25|$|There {{is always}} a risk that outsiders and {{undercover}} policemen might masquerade as a mafioso to infiltrate the organization. To ensure that this does not happen, a mafioso must never introduce himself to another mafioso whom he does not personally know, even if he knows the other through reputation. If he wants to establish a relationship, he must ask a third mafioso whom they both personally know to introduce them {{to each other in}} a face-to-face <b>meeting.</b> <b>This</b> intermediary can vouch that neither of the two is an impostor.|$|E

40|$|As {{the range}} of ICT {{applications}} in business organizations grows ever larger and takes up an increasing amount of time, the question arises as to whether this could {{have an impact on}} <b>meetings.</b> <b>This</b> paper explores {{the extent to which the}} use of ICTs replaces face-to-face interactions. The data was gathered by telephone interviews from a sample population of 2, 500 company managers questioned over a five-year period between 2001 and 2005. The results indicate that substitution of face-to-face interactions by e-mail only occurs in a few organizations (< 15 percent of cases), while a quarter of the sample population felt that ICT use had led to an improvement in <b>meetings.</b> <b>This</b> appears to confirm the superposition effect of different media or the so-called âNapoleon effect. ...|$|R

On 29 June 1794, three colleagues of Robespierre at 'the Committee' called him a dictator in his face â Robespierre baffled left the <b>meeting.</b> <b>This</b> encouraged other Convention members to also defy Robespierre. On 26 July, a long and vague speech of Robespierre wasn't met with thunderous applause as usual but with hostility; some deputies yelled that Robespierre should {{have the courage to}} say which deputies he deemed necessary to be killed next, what Robespierre refused to do.|$|E
25|$|In the Polish capital desperate street-to-street and house-to-house {{fighting}} took place. The Warsaw AK district had 50,000 poorly armed members. They faced a massively reinforced German {{force of}} 22,000 SS and regular army units. The Polish command hoped {{to establish a}} provisional Polish administration to greet the arriving Soviets, but came nowhere close to <b>meeting</b> <b>this</b> goal. The Germans and their allies engaged in mass slaughter of the civilian population, including between 40,000 and 50,000 massacred in the districts of Wola, Ochota and MokotÃ³w. The SS and auxiliary units recruited from the Soviet Army deserters (the Dirlewanger Brigade and the R.O.N.A. Brigade) were particularly brutal.|$|E
25|$|<b>Meeting</b> <b>this</b> {{scalability}} {{condition is}} possible {{for a wide range}} of systems. However, the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required bits. The number required to factor integers using Shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between L and L2, where L is the number of bits in the number to be factored; error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of L. For a 1000-bit number, this implies a need for about 104 bits without error correction. With error correction, the figure would rise to about 107 bits. Computation time is about L2 or about 107 steps and at 1nbsp&MHz, about 10 seconds.|$|E
