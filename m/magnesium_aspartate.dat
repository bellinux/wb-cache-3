50|$|ZMA (Zinc Monomethionine Aspartate, <b>Magnesium</b> <b>Aspartate</b> and Vitamin B6) is a {{supplement}} used primarily by athletes, gymnasts, and bodybuilders. It advertises {{itself as a}} 'recovery aid' that allegedly helps the body achieve deeper levels of REM sleep. It was developed by Victor Conte (founder of BALCO Laboratories in Burlingame, California, and a felon who served time in prison in 2005 after pleading guilty to conspiracy to distribute steroids and money laundering). ZMA claims to raise strength levels and enhance hormonal profiles.The study most often used to support the hormone effects of ZMA is one done at Western Washington University. Dr. Lorrie Brilla (and a ZMA supplement manufacturer) studied 12 NCAA division II football players who took ZMA nightly during an eight-week spring training program and a separate selected group assigned a placebo pill. The athletes taking the ZMA reportedly had 2.5 times greater muscle strength gains than the placebo group; the ZMA group increased by 11.6 percent compared to only 4.6 percent in the placebo group. The ZMA group also had 30 percent increases in testosterone levels (compared to 10 percent in the placebo group).However, one of the scientists who conducted the study holds the registered trademark for the original formula of ZMA, and his company funded the research, contrary to the best-practices in scientific research that avoids conflicts-of-interest.|$|E
50|$|Aspartate and {{glutamate}} are excitatory neurotransmitters. At {{high doses}} (consumed either independently or {{in excess of}} other protein-containing foods), can potentially stimulate neurons {{to the point of}} injury or death. The most compelling evidence that glutamate and aspartate function as neurotransmitters came from the observation that at low concentrations they excite virtually every neuron in the central nervous system. Excitotoxicity has been identified in animal studies and found that aspartic acid loads on the same brain receptors as glutamic acid, causing brain lesions and neuroendocrine disorders, and to act in an additive fashion with glutamic acid.When considering aspartate sources individually, the levels of exposure estimated in this opinion amount up to 6 g/day for calcium aspartate (equivalent to 100 mg/kg bw/day for a 60 kg individual), 5.8 g/day for <b>magnesium</b> <b>aspartate</b> (equivalent to 97 mg/kg bw/day), 4 g/day for potassium aspartate (equivalent to 67 mg/kg bw/day), 0.05 g/day for zinc aspartate (0.8 mg/kg bw/day) and 0.008 g/day for copper aspartate (0.1 mg/kg bw/day). These values are all below those reported to induce amino acid imbalance in intervention trials (6.3 g aspartate/day) and they are, respectively, 7, 7.2, 10.5, 875 and 7000 times lower than the NOAEL for aspartate identified from a 90-day rat study. Based on these margins of safety, the Panel concludes that the use of zinc and copper aspartate, as sources of zinc and copper at the proposed use levels, are not of safety concern but that the use of calcium, magnesium and potassium aspartate could be of safety concern because the margins of safety are considered too low. The Panel notes that if all sources would be used simultaneously, combined exposure will be 16 g/day (equivalent to 267 mg/kg bw/day), which is above the reported amounts inducing amino acid imbalance in intervention trials (6.3 g/day). Furthermore, this value is only 3 times lower than the NOAEL from the rat study and due to the low margin of safety the Panel considers this of safety concern. The Panel estimates that the exposure to aspartate from these food supplements should be added to the aspartate exposure arising from the diet.Based on US data, estimates of the mean exposure to aspartic acid arising from the diet are 4.1 g/day (children 1-3 year old) to 9.3 g/day (males 19-30 year old) and at the 95th percentile 6.6 g/day (children 4-8 year old) to 12.9 g/day (males 19-50 year old). Under these conditions, estimates of maximum daily exposure to aspartate ions from the diet (13 g/day) and from calcium or <b>magnesium</b> <b>aspartate</b> supplements would be approximately 19 g/day6, and from potassium aspartate would be 17 g/day. Aspartate exposure estimates from zinc or copper supplementation would not significantly change aspartate exposure from the diet. Taken individually these levels of exposure are lower than those reported to induce amino acid imbalance in intervention trials, when aspartate exposure from the diet is also taken into consideration (19.3 g/day). However, when considering the potential total intake of aspartic ions arising from the diet and from a potential multi-mineral combination of all food supplements the exposure could add up to 29 g/day. In line with the SCF concerns, the Panel considers that the use of L-amino acids in food supplements should not give rise to a nutritional imbalance of the amino acids. Thus the Panel concludes that under these conditions aspartate ion exposure from a multi-mineral combination of this type could be of safety concern.|$|E

40|$|Mg is an {{important}} mineral for > 300 processes {{in the human body}} such as energy production, muscle anabolism and blood pressure regulation. However, there is limited research into Mg 2 + performance-related effect on short-term high-intensity exercise and subsequent effect on blood pressure and muscle recovery post exercise. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effect of Mg supplementation on peak and mean power during all-out maximal-intensity short-term exercise in order to examine its effect on systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) post maximal exercise and to investigate whether muscular recovery, using post-exercise isokinetic knee extensions, could be improved. Six healthy male subjects (mean age 20. 8 years old, mean height 1. 80 m and mean mass 79 kg) were required to fill out a 3 d diet sheet before testing for analysis of Mg intake. The study was a double-blind repeated-measures cross-over design with subjects supplemented with either placebo (cornflour) or 300 mg <b>magnesium</b> <b>aspartate</b> for 2 d before the test day and 300 mg on the test day before testing. Maximal isokinetic extensions of five repetitions by the right leg were performed by each subject 1 week before the testing to produce a baseline result for peak torque (N/m). The test day consisted of subjects performing a 30 s Wingate anaerobic test (WAnT) (1) and resting for 30 min post WAnT before performing five maximal isokinetic knee extensions at 60 /s on the right leg. A further 100 mg <b>magnesium</b> <b>aspartate</b> or placebo was given to each subject immediately post WAnT. Peak power and mean power (W) were recorded from each WAnT. Peak torque (N/m) was measured from the isokinetic knee extensions. SBP and DBP were recorded at rest and every 5 min during the 30 min recovery after the WAnT. Mean peak power (W) was significantly increased (P 0. 05) in DBP between the placebo and the Mg condition during the 30 min recovery post WAnT. These improvements in WAnT and peak torque may be a result of Mg acting as a ???second messenger??? for insulin, thus increasing the insulin sensitivity of cell membranes(2), allowing for a greater uptake of energy substrates such as creatine into the muscles(3), a consequence of which would be an improved intramuscular recovery of phosphocreatine and ATP. It has been known for some time that intramuscular Mg elicits ATPase activity(4) and that Mg-bound ATP present on the acto-myosin cross-bridges has been proved to speed up filament detachment(5). This increased rate of ATP hydrolysis (from higher ATPase activity) on the myosin heads results in faster and stronger filament detachment and reattachment producing a faster and more powerful muscle contraction, as shown by the results of the present study. It is further suggested that the reduction in blood pressure can be attributed to increased vasodilation attributed to decreased Ca channel activity in the presence of Mg, resulting in decreased vascular resistance(6). The present study demonstrates that Mg supplementation increases peak and mean power during a WAnT and can enhance recovery by reducing SBP and improving peak torque in an isokinetic knee extension after maximal short-term exercise. Further research on hypertensive recreational athletes is needed to build on these initial findings...|$|E

Based on the epidemiological data collected in these 2 years, we initiated an investigation on the source of the outbreak. The aim {{of this study was to}} report the results of the investigation, as well as the intervention strategies that resulted in successful control of the outbreak. MethodsAn infection control team was set up consisting of infectious disease specialists, microbiologists, infection control practitioners, and head nurses. The microbiology and medical records of case-patients with P. fulva or P. putida bloodstream infections were reviewed. Environmental samples and intravenous (IV) solutions from the wards and the pharmacy center were collected for culturing. The molecular characteristics of the bacterial isolates were studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Strict infection control strategies were implemented. ResultsA total of 20 case-patients from five inpatient wards were identified during three summer seasons from 2010 to 2012. Nineteen of them recovered with proper antibiotics. Unfortunately one died from complications of heart failure. A total of 19 isolates of P. fulva and four of P. putida were identified, of which 20 were from blood, two from environmental surface samples from the hospital pharmacy, and one from an in-use compounded solution from a case-patient in the cardiology ward.

40|$|A complex {{interaction}} of animal factors, pre-slaughter {{management of the}} pig and post-slaughter carcass processing can have a significant influence on pork quality. Pork quality attributes are dependent upon the concentration of glycogen in the muscle at slaughter and the rate and extent of post-slaughter muscle glycolysis. Acute stress just prior to slaughter can lead to rapid rate of glycolysis and therefore rapid accumulation of lactate and a low muscle pH and pale, soft, exudative (PSE) pork. On the other hand low muscle glycogen at slaughter can lead to insufficient lactic acid formation, high muscle pH and dark, firm, dry (DFD) pork. Major pork quality defects such as PSE and DFD have resulted in large economic losses for the Australian pork industry, where PSE pork alone has been estimated to cost the industry $ 24 million per year. This thesis comprises {{a review of the}} literature related to the biochemistry involved, particularly muscle glycogenolysis, in the conversion of muscle to meat and the influence of various animal, pre- and post-slaughter factors on pork quality. The experimental work comprises of six experiments which examine the relationships between on-farm management, pre-slaughter management and post-slaughter processing and their influence on muscle physiology and glycogenolysis and ultimate pork quality. 1. Determination of muscle glycogen and lactic acid concentrations in muscle samples removed from the live pig using a shot-biopsy procedure. A total of 14 male crossbred finisher pigs were used in this experiment. The shot-biopsy procedure was used to remove muscle samples from the live pig. The Longissimus thoracis and Biceps femoris muscle had similar glycogen (13. 7 and 12. 5 mg/g wet weight respectively) and lactic acid (1. 3 and 1. 9 mg/g wet weight respectively) concentrations. By determining resting muscle glycogen and lactic acid concentrations in the live pig, the results can be used as an indicator of the extent of glycogenolysis that occurs in the muscle pre-slaughter and in comparing the influence of pre-slaughter factors such as handling and mixing of unfamiliar pigs on muscle glycogen concentrations at slaughter. 2. The effect of on farm and pre-slaughter handling on pork quality. Thirty-six male crossbred pigs were used in a 2 x 2 factorial design which consisted of 2 on-farm handling treatments (positive and negative handling) and 2 abattoir handling treatments (minimal and negative handling just prior to slaughter). Pigs negatively handled on-farm had lower muscle glycogen concentrations at slaughter, but there was no difference in muscle paleness or % drip loss compared to pigs positively handled on-farm. Pigs negatively handled at the abattoir had lower muscle glycogen concentrations at slaughter, but muscle paleness, % drip loss and the incidence of PSE were similar compared to pigs minimally handled at the abattoir. The results from this experiment indicate that pigs negatively handled on-farm have the potential to respond adversely to handling at the abattoir and hence may result in inferior pork quality. 3. The effect of mixing pigs during lairage and negative handling just prior to slaughter on pork quality. Forty-eight male crossbred pigs were used in a 2 x 2 factorial design which consisted of 2 lairage treatments (unmixed pigs during lairage and pigs mixed during lairage) and 2 abattoir handling treatments (minimal and negative handling just prior to slaughter). Mixing of pigs during lairage induced a high level of fighting among pigs and hence the pigs had lower muscle glycogen concentrations at slaughter, lower % drip, darker pork, a higher incidence of DFD and a lower incidence of PSE pork compared with unmixed pigs kept together during lairage. Negative handling just prior to slaughter did not affect muscle glycogen concentrations at slaughter or pork quality indicators in pigs that were unmixed or mixed during lairage. The unmixed pigs had a higher incidence of PSE irrespective of the handling treatment just prior to slaughter. This experiment has demonstrated that mixing of unfamiliar pigs during lairage can have a major influencer on pork quality, increase the incidence of DFD pork and reduce the incidence of PSE. 4. The effect of negative handling pre-slaughter and delays in carcass processing post-slaughter on pork quality. Forty-eight male crossbred pigs were used in a 2 x 2 factorial design which consisted of 2 abattoir handling treatments (minimal and negative handling just prior to slaughter) and 2 carcass processing durations (normal - 45 min and delayed - 70 min processing). Pigs negatively handled prior to slaughter had lower muscle glycogen concentrations at slaughter, higher surface exudate and higher incidence of PSE pork compared to pigs minimally handled just prior to slaughter. Delays in carcass processing resulted in paler pork in the leg although the effect was minimal. The results from this experiment suggest that the quality of preslaughter handling had a greater effect on the incidence of PSE compared to delays in carcass processing. 5. The effect of dietary <b>magnesium</b> <b>aspartate</b> on pork quality. Forty-eight male crossbred pigs were used in a 2 x 2 factorial design which consisted of 2 diet treatments (control diet and diet supplemented with <b>magnesium</b> <b>aspartate</b> (MgAsp)) and 2 abattoir handling treatments. Pigs fed the MgAsp supplemented diet had higher plasma magnesium concentrations and lower plasma noradrenaline concentrations at slaughter compared to pigs fed the control diet. Pigs fed the control diet also had higher % drip loss, paler pork and a higher incidence of PSE compared to pigs fed the MgAsp supplemented diet. Dietary MgAsp supplementation reduced the incidence of PSE to zero irrespective of the handling treatment prior to slaughter. Pigs fed the control diet and negatively handled at the abattoir had lower muscle glycogen at slaughter and higher % drip loss compared to pigs fed the control diet and minimally handled prior to slaughter. The results from this experiment indicate that dietary MgAsp supplementation is effective in reducing the effects of stress, improving pork quality and reducing the incidence of PSE pork. 6. The effect of different dietary magnesium supplements on pork quality. Fortyeight male crossbred pigs were used in this experiment and consisted of 4 diet treatments (control diet, <b>magnesium</b> <b>aspartate</b> (MgAsp) supplemented diet, magnesium sulphate (MgSO 4) supplemented diet and magnesium chloride (MgC 12) supplemented diet. The MgAsp and MgSO 4 but not the MgC 12 supplemented diet increased plasma magnesium concentrations in comparison with the control diet however no reduction in plasma catecholamine concentrations were observed. Pigs fed the magnesium diets (MgAsp, MgSO 4 and MgCl 2) had higher muscle glycogen concentrations at slaughter and lower % drip loss in comparison with pigs fed the control diet. The results further highlight the benefit of dietary magnesium supplementation in improving pork quality. Thus MgSO 4 and MgC 12, which are cheaper and more readily available sources of magnesium can be as effective as MgAsp in improving pork quality. 7. The effect of dose and duration of dietary <b>magnesium</b> <b>aspartate</b> supplementation on plasma metabolites in pigs. Sixteen crossbred males which were cannulated via the cephalic vein prior to the start of the supplementation period were used in this experiment. The pigs were allocated to one of four diets (control diet, 20 g MgAsp, 40 g MgAsp and 60 g MgAsp respectively). Pigs fed the magnesium diets exhibited increases in plasma magnesium concentration in the first two days. Also the highest increases in plasma magnesium concentrations corresponded to the pigs fed the lowest magnesium supplemented diet. The lowest magnesium dose maintained plasma concentrations throughout the supplementation period whereas the other diets declined to pre-treatment concentrations. The results hence indicate, that a lower dose of dietary magnesium for a shorter duration is more appropriate to maintain increases in plasma magnesium concentration. The results in this thesis demonstrate the importance of positive on-farm handling, management of pigs during the lairage period, handling just prior to slaughter and carcass processing to consistently produce quality pork. The propensity to develop PSE may be already evident prior to transport from the farm, however, results indicate that the factor which determines whether the pork carcass will be PSE is the nature of handling the pigs receives in the last few minutes prior to slaughter. Finally the results from this thesis highlight the effectiveness of dietary magnesium supplementation in improving pork quality and reducing the incidence of PSE pork.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: <b>Magnesium</b> <b>aspartate</b> {{hydrochloride}} (Magnesiocard, Mg-Asp-HCl) {{is proposed}} {{as a substitute}} of magnesium sulfate {{for the treatment of}} preeclampsia and premature labor. After an i. v. administration of a dose equivalent to that used in the treatment of preeclampsia to nonpregnant volunteers, a 10 -fold increase of aspartic acid (Asp) over the physiological level was observed. Animal experiments have demonstrated that highly increased fetal levels of acidic amino acids such as Asp could be associated with neurotoxic damage in the fetal brain. The influence of such an elevation of Asp concentration in the maternal circuit on the fetal level, using the in vitro perfusion model of human placenta, was investigated. STUDY DESIGN: After a control phase (2 h), a therapeutic dose of Mg combined with Asp (Magnesiocard, Mg-Asp-HCl) was applied to the maternal circuit approaching 10 times the physiological level of Asp. The administration was performed in two different phases simulating either a peak of maximum concentration (bolus application, 2 h) or a steady state level (initially added, 4 h). RESULTS: In four experiments, during experimental phases (6 h) a slow increase in concentration in the fetal circuit was seen for Mg, AIB (alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, artificial amino acid) and creatinine confirming previous observations. In contrast, no net transfer of Asp across the placenta was seen. A continuous decrease in the concentration of Asp on both maternal and fetal side suggests active uptake and metabolization by the placenta. Viability control parameters remained stable indicating the absence of an effect on placental metabolism, permeability and morphology. CONCLUSION: Elevation of Asp concentration up to 10 times the physiological level by the administration of Mg-Asp-HCl to the maternal circuit under in vitro perfusion conditions of human placenta has no influence on the fetal level of Asp suggesting no transfer of Asp from the maternal to fetal compartment. Therefore, the administration of Mg-Asp-HCl to preeclamptic patients would be beneficial for the patients without any impact on placental or fetal physiology...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{observe the}} {{therapeutic}} effect of Chishaodanpi decoction (CSDPD) on chronic viral cholestatic hepatitis. MethodsA total of 107 subjects with chronic viral cholestatic hepatitis {{were enrolled in}} our hospital from March 2007 to November 2012. Patients were randomly divided into treatment (54 cases) and control groups (53 cases). The control group was treated with potassium <b>magnesium</b> <b>aspartate,</b> diammonium glycyrrhizinate, glucurolactone, vitamin C, and lamivudine, once a day. The treatment group was treated with modified CSDPD, 100 mL a time, twice a day, {{in addition to the}} treatment given to the control group. The patients in both groups were treated for 8 weeks. The main symptoms and signs were recorded every day throughout the clinical trial. Before and after the trial, changes in liver function including total bilirubin (TBil), direct bilirubin (DBil), total bile acid (TBA), and the activities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and γ-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT), were all detected. Adverse reactions were also recorded. ResultsThere were no differences in gender, age, disease duration, symptoms, signs, or laboratory findings between the two groups (P> 0. 05). After an 8 -week treatment, improvements in jaundice, weakness, poor appetite, abdominal distention, and skin itching were significantly better in the treatment group than in the control group (P< 0. 05). In the treatment group, 43 patients had a significant response to the treatment, seven patients had a response, and four patients had no response, with 21, 12, and 20 patients in the control group, respectively. The total effective rate was 92. 6 % in the treatment group and 62. 3 % in the control group, which was a significant difference (P< 0. 05). The levels of TBil, DBil, TBA, ALP, ALT, AST, and γ-GT in both groups were significantly lower after treatment, and were significantly different between the two groups (P< 0. 05). A few patients in the treatment group had mild adverse effects such as increased bowel movement frequency and mild stomachache. No other adverse reactions were observed in either group. ConclusionCSDPD has a satisfactory therapeutic effect on chronic viral cholestatic hepatitis...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to its antiarrhythmic and antithrombotic effects magnesium {{is said to have}} a beneficial effect in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Magnesium can protect myocardial tissue after coronary occlusion and reduces infarct size in experimental models of ischaemia and reperfusion, though the given doses of magnesium are relatively high and differ from clinically reachable serum concentrations. We tested 2 hypotheses in a dog model of ischaemia-reperfusion: 1. The protective effect may be due to a direct, local influence of magnesium on myocardial reperfusion injury. 2. Systemic magnesium treatment with low doses comparable to clinical study regiments may reduce myocardial infarct size. Anaesthetized open chest dogs underwent 1 h of left anterior descending artery occlusion followed by 6 h of reperfusion. 1. Ten animals received intracoronary <b>magnesium</b> <b>aspartate</b> (Mg i. c.) or vehicle infusion (control i. c.) for the first hour of reperfusion to increase regional Mg-concentration by 2 mmol/l. 2. Fourteen animals received intravenous infusion with magnesium potassium aspartate (Mg-K i. v.) or vehicle infusion (control i. v.), beginning 1 h before occlusion {{until the end of the}} 6 h reperfusion period. Regional magnesium concentration in the Mg i. c. -group increased to 2. 7 +/- 1. 00 mmol/l at 45 min of reperfusion. Intravenous infusion raised serum magnesium from 0. 71 +/- 0. 03 mmol/l to 1. 29 +/- 0. 14 mmol/l in the Mg-K i. v. group (5 min of reperfusion, p < 0. 01 vs. baseline). Infarct size after 6 h reperfusion (TTC staining) was similar in both groups of intracoronary treatment (Mg i. c., 20. 6 +/- 5. 0; control, 24. 4 +/- 8. 7 % of area at risk; p = n. s.) and intravenous treatment (Mg-K i. v. 18. 1 +/- 14. 8; control 14. 1 +/- 12. 2 % of area at risk; p = n. s.). Neither regional nor systemic magnesium leads to a clinically relevant reduction of infarct size in the regional ischaemic-reperfused dog heart when it is given in clinically usable doses. The beneficial action of systemic Mg is probably not due to an early direct protective effect on ischaemic-reperfused myocardium but to its antiarrhythmic and antithrombotic effects. Possibly only to high doses of Mg applied under experimental conditions can reduce infarct siz...|$|E
40|$|Published Online: 3 APR 2014; Assessed as up-to-date: 31 MAR 2013 Background: Magnesium is an {{essential}} mineral required for regulation of body temperature, nucleic acid and protein synthesis and in maintaining nerve and muscle cell electrical potentials. Many women, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, have low intakes of magnesium. Magnesium supplementation during pregnancy {{may be able to}} reduce fetal growth restriction and pre-eclampsia, and increase birthweight. Objectives: To assess the effects of magnesium supplementation during pregnancy on maternal, neonatal/infant and paediatric outcomes. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 March 2013). Selection criteria: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials assessing the effects of dietary magnesium supplementation during pregnancy were included. The primary outcomes were perinatal mortality (including stillbirth and neonatal death prior to hospital discharge), small-for-gestational age, maternal mortality and pre-eclampsia. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Main results: Ten trials involving 9090 women and their babies were included; one trial had a cluster design (with randomisation by study centre). All 10 trials randomly allocated women to either an oral magnesium supplement or a control group; in eight trials a placebo was used, and in two trials no treatment was given to the control group. In the 10 included trials, the compositions of the magnesium supplements, gestational ages at commencement, and doses administered varied, including: magnesium oxide, 1000 mg daily from ≤ four months post-conception (one trial); magnesium citrate, 365 mg daily from ≤ 18 weeks until hospitalisation after 38 weeks (one trial), and 340 mg daily from nine to 27 weeks' gestation (one trial); magnesium gluconate, 2 to 3 g from 28 weeks' gestation until birth (one trial), and 4 g daily from 23 weeks' gestation (one trial); <b>magnesium</b> <b>aspartate,</b> 15 mmol daily (three trials, commencing from either six to 21 weeks' gestation until birth, ≤ 16 weeks' gestation until birth, or < 12 weeks until birth), or 365 mg daily from 13 to 24 weeks until birth (one trial); and magnesium stearate, 128 mg elemental magnesium from 10 to 35 weeks until birth (one trial). In the analysis of all trials, oral magnesium supplementation compared to no magnesium was associated with no significant difference in perinatal mortality (stillbirth and neonatal death prior to discharge) (risk ratio (RR) 1. 10; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 72 to 1. 67; five trials, 5903 infants), small-for-gestational age (RR 0. 76; 95 % CI 0. 54 to 1. 07; three trials, 1291 infants), or pre-eclampsia (RR 0. 87; 95 % CI 0. 58 to 1. 32; three trials, 1042 women). None of the included trials reported on maternal mortality. Considering secondary outcomes, while no increased risk of stillbirth was observed, a possible increased risk of neonatal death prior to hospital discharge was shown for infants born to mothers who had received magnesium (RR 2. 21; 95 % CI 1. 02 to 4. 75; four trials, 5373 infants). One trial contributed over 70 % of the participants to the analysis for this outcome; the trial authors suggested that the large number of severe congenital anomalies in the supplemented group (unlikely attributable to magnesium) and the deaths of two sets of twins (with birthweights < 750 g) in the supplemented group likely accounted for the increased risk of death observed, and thus this result should be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, when the deaths due to severe congenital abnormalities in this trial were excluded from the meta-analysis, no increased risk of neonatal death was seen for the magnesium supplemented group. Magnesium supplementation was associated with significantly fewer babies with an Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (RR 0. 34; 95 % CI 0. 15 to 0. 80; four trials, 1083 infants), with meconium-stained liquor (RR 0. 79; 95 % CI 0. 63 to 0. 99; one trial, 4082 infants), late fetal heart decelerations (RR 0. 68; 95 % CI 0. 53 to 0. 88; one trial, 4082 infants), and mild hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (RR 0. 38; 95 % CI 0. 15 to 0. 98; one trial, 4082 infants). Women receiving magnesium were significantly less likely to require hospitalisation during pregnancy (RR 0. 65, 95 % CI 0. 48 to 0. 86; three trials, 1158 women). Of the 10 trials included in the review, only two were judged to be of high quality overall. When an analysis was restricted to these two trials none of the review's primary outcomes (perinatal mortality, small-for-gestational age, pre-eclampsia) were significantly different between the magnesium supplemented and control groups. Authors' conclusions: There is not enough high-quality evidence to show that dietary magnesium supplementation during pregnancy is beneficial.
