500|$|Faust {{noted the}} cynicism about the brony fandom, and commented that in {{considering}} the idea of grown men watching a show for little girls, [...] "They think there's something wrong with that, something devious about it"; she noted that it was [...] "upsetting to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> jump to those conclusions". Faust believes that her future animated shows aimed at girls {{will be easier to}} sell considering the male adult fandom of Friendship Is Magic, and that that type of programming is not as great a risk as is perceived. After Hasbro issued a cease and desist to the Fighting Is Magic project over the use of copyrighted and trademarked characters, Faust offered to provide the developers with original character arts to allow them to continue to develop the game without copyright issues.|$|E

[...] "It's so interesting to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> talk about late-night comedy being cynical," [...] he says. [...] "What's more cynical than forming an ideological news network like Fox and calling it 'fair and balanced'? What we do, I almost think, is adorable in its idealism." [...] Stewart has said {{that he does not}} take any joy in the failings of American government, despite the comedic fodder they provide. [...] "We're not the guys at the craps table betting against the line," [...] he said on Larry King Live. [...] "If government suddenly became inspiring... we would be the happiest people in the world to turn our attention to idiots like, you know, media people, no offense." ...|$|E
500|$|Partially {{due to her}} {{experiences}} filming Mermaids, Cher turned down leading roles in such films as The War of the Roses and Thelma & Louise. According to Berman, [...] "After the success of Moonstruck, she was so worried about her next career move that she was overly cautious." [...] In the early 1990s, she contracted the Epstein–Barr virus and developed chronic fatigue syndrome, which left her too exhausted to sustain her music and film careers. Because she needed to earn money and was not healthy enough to work on other projects, she starred in infomercials launching health, beauty, and diet products, which earned her close to $10million in fees. The skits were parodied on Saturday Night Live and critics considered them a sellout, many suggesting her film career was over. She told Ladies' Home Journal, [...] "Suddenly I became the Infomercial Queen and it didn't occur to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> would focus on that and strip me of all my other things." ...|$|E

500|$|Of Rubber Souls [...] "If I Needed Someone", Harrison said: [...] "it's like {{a million}} other songs written around the D chord. If you move your fingers about, you get various little melodies... it amazes <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> still find new {{permutations}} of the same notes." [...] His other contribution to the album, [...] "Think for Yourself", features what Everett described as [...] "ambiguous tonal coloring", using chromaticism in G major with a [...] "strange" [...] mixture of the Dorian mode and the minor pentatonic; he called it a [...] "tour de force of altered scale degrees". In 1966 Harrison contributed innovative musical ideas to Revolver. He played backwards guitar on Lennon's composition [...] "I'm Only Sleeping" [...] and a guitar counter-melody on [...] "And Your Bird Can Sing" [...] that moved in parallel octaves above McCartney's bass downbeats. His guitar playing on [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] exemplified the pairing of altered chordal colours with descending chromatic lines and his guitar part for Sgt Peppers [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" [...] mirrors Lennon's vocal line {{in much the same}} way that a sarangi player accompanies a khyal singer in a Hindu devotional song.|$|E
500|$|Before the album's release, in December 2012, Cudi {{dedicated}} Indicud to {{the late}} Ben Breedlove and all his fans who died, continuing: [...] "My journey shall continue in your honor. Never forgotten." [...] The dedication was ultimately included in the album's liner notes. The album is upbeat and optimistic, very much unlike his previous studio album [...] (2010), which was considered darkly erratic. The positive vibe stems from Cudi's desire to always change and reinvent: [...] "I always try to push myself {{to the next level}} with everything I do. Since I've been in the business, critics have known that about me. When I started working on Indicud, I just wanted to bring more energy into my sound. Most of my old music was driven towards relaxed, chilled out smoke music. And that was my goal first coming in. Now it's like, 'What’s a side of <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> haven’t seen?' The only time people have seen me on up-tempos is on remixes or some shit. So I just wanted to take the energy to the next level. That ultimately inspired the subject matter. It was a chain reaction. With the up-tempos came more positive lyrics. It just brightened up the whole shit." ...|$|E
500|$|One dispute {{among the}} founders of Century 21 – Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, Reg Hill and John Read – emerged from the filming of other scenes, {{including}} {{one in which the}} character of Lise Hartman bathes in a shower. Read, the director of photography, had complied with Parrish's instructions to light the sequence in silhouette. Anderson, who had intended the scene to display full-frontal nudity from actress Loni von Friedl, demanded a re-shoot, insisting that Read honour his obligations not just to Parrish as director but also to his Century 21 partners. According to Sylvia Anderson, [...] "Gerry was very keen to show that {{he was part of the}} 'Swinging Sixties' and felt that seeing a detailed nude shot – as he visualised it – was more 'with it' than the more subdued version." [...] Anderson clashed with Read and Parrish for a second time when special effects shots of Phoenix were filmed with a hand-held camera: [...] "I knew enough about space travel to know that in a vacuum a spacecraft will travel as straight as a die... told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> were not familiar with space travel and therefore they would expect to see this kind of movement." [...] Refusing to re-film the scenes on the basis that Parrish's instructions had precedence over Anderson's, Read resigned from both Century 21 and the production of Doppelgänger at the Andersons' and Hill's request. Anderson elaborated: [...] "Clearly John was in a difficult position. I do now understand how he must have felt, but in my heart I feel he couldn't play a double role." ...|$|E

[...] When Moore retired in 2013, he reflected on the play, [...] "It's amusing to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> think it's so amusing.

[...] "It upsets <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> think what I'm doing is a bad thing", Hilton told Access Hollywood. [...] "I don't think it's a bad thing.

2500|$|Mark Bell's {{programming}} {{gave the}} song its [...] "militaristic mode", which further conveys {{the sense of}} mission expressed in the lyrics. Björk had recorded the vocals, bass line and chord structure of [...] "Hunter" [...] before Bell met her in Spain; he recorded the beats in one take after she had explained to him how she wanted them to sound like. In an interview with Sweater, Björk said: [...] "It amazes <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> still can't grasp that live element of it." [...] Regarding {{the beat of the}} song, engineer Markus Dravs stated it [...] "is very much a Mark Bell beat interpretation of her. The idea of it being a Boleric beat was hers, but we tried different versions and I think it was Mark in the end {{who came up with the}} idea of just doing it on a 909. Then we all had a go on the filtering and played around with the decay of each individual drum." ...|$|E
2500|$|Due to a {{widespread}} practice by insurers to indemnify San Francisco properties from fire, but not earthquake damage, {{most of the}} destruction in the city was blamed on the fires. Some property owners deliberately set fire to damaged properties in order to claim them on their insurance. Capt. Leonard D. Wildman of the U.S. Army Signal Corps reported that he [...] "was stopped by a fireman who told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> in that neighborhood were firing their houses… {{they were told that}} they would not get their insurance on buildings damaged by the earthquake unless they were damaged by fire. The insurance industry eventually paid out over $250,000,000 (the largest amount they paid out for the next 60 years) which significantly helped to rebuild the city." [...] Building standards of the original 1906 buildings had almost no earthquake resistance built in. Since 1906 earthquake standards have been steadily upgraded as damages caused by earthquakes are investigated. Unfortunately, a lot of older buildings do not meet today's standards, and it would typically cost too much to upgrade them. It was discovered in 1906 (again) that all masonry-type structures built of brick and un-reinforced concrete are resistance to fire but not earthquakes. A detailed analysis of the city of San Francisco today estimates that an earthquake over 7.0 magnitude would completely destroy or seriously damage many sections of San Francisco and could possibly result in thousands of deaths. Today in most communities, structures built to later earthquake standards would do well in all but the strongest earthquakes. The water mains and other infrastructure needed for fighting fires have all been upgraded but are yet untested.|$|E
2500|$|Lewis {{is widely}} hailed {{as one of}} the most {{influential}} pianists in the history of rock and roll. [...] In an often quoted tribute, Elvis Presley once said that if he could play the piano like Lewis he would quit singing. [...] Lewis's pivotal role in popularizing the piano in rock and roll is indisputable. [...] Up until his arrival, the music had been primarily associated with guitars, but his early Sun recordings and television appearances pushed the instrument to the forefront. [...] Lewis was also an incendiary showman who often played with his fists, elbows, feet, and backside, sometimes climbing on top of the piano during gigs and even apocryphally setting it on fire. [...] Like Chuck Berry's guitar playing, Lewis's piano style has become synonymous with rock and roll, having influenced generations of piano players. [...] In a 2013 interview with Leah Harper, Elton John recalls that up until [...] "Great Balls of Fire," [...] "the piano playing that I had heard had been more sedate. [...] My dad collected George Shearing records, but this was the first time I heard someone beat the shit out of a piano. When I saw Little Richard at the Harrow Granada, he played it standing up, but Jerry Lee Lewis actually jumped on the piano! This was astonishing to <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> could do that. Those records had such a huge effect on me, and they were just so great. I learned to play like that." [...] Lewis is primarily known for his [...] "boogie woogie" [...] style, which is characterized by a regular left hand bass figure and dancing beat, but his command of the instrument and highly individualistic style set him apart. [...] Appearing on Memphis Sounds with George Klein in 2011, Lewis credited his older piano-playing cousin Carl McVoy as being a crucial influence, stating, [...] "He was a great piano player, a great singer, and a nice looking man, carried himself real well. [...] I miss Carl very much." [...] Lewis also cited Moon Mullican as a source of inspiration. [...] Although almost entirely self-taught, Lewis conceded to biographer Rich Bragg in 2014 that Paul Whitehead, a blind pianist from Meadville, Mississippi, was another key influence on him in his earliest days playing clubs, confiding, [...] "Paul Whitehead done a lot. [...] His lesson was worth a billion dollars to me...He taught me. [...] I'd sit beside him, and say, 'Mr. Paul, can you show me exactly how you do that?' [...] Mr. Paul was good to me." ...|$|E

60|$|By and by, {{in the bed}} of {{a shallow}} rivulet, I found a deposit of shining yellow scales, and my breath almost forsook me!

Solitude. No creature was near. Then I returned to my mine, fortifying myself against possible disappointment, but my fears were groundless--the shining scales were still there. I set about scooping them out, and for an hour I toiled down the windings of the stream and robbed its bed. But at last the descending sun warned me to give up the quest, and I turned homeward laden with wealth. As I walked along I could not help smiling at the thought of my being so excited over my fragment of silver when a nobler metal was almost under my nose.
