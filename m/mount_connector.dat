The specification defines a 156-pin surface <b>mount</b> <b>connector</b> for the PCI Express signals. The new connector occupies the same board location as the legacy PC/104 ISA connector.

40|$|Consumer comfort {{is a top}} {{priority}} in todayâ€™s vehicle design. Reduction of noise and vibration enhances comfort and improves {{the overall quality of}} the vehicle. Linear elastic vibration isolation mounts are traditionally applied within complex structures to combat noise and vibration. Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) is becoming an established and tested noise and vibration modeling methodology that is frequently used to model the flow of noise and vibration in complex structures. A SEA model of a linear elastic vibration isolation mount is developed here which enables SEA analysis of elastically isolated systems for the first time. A vibration isolation mount model has been absent from SEA models {{because of the lack of}} an SEA formulation. Linear elastic vibration isolation mount SEA equations are developed here for the first time. The basis of SEA theory is energy sharing among vibrational mode groups. Traditionally, vibration isolation mounts were thought of as compliant elements with no modes suitable to SEA analysis. An example mount is defined and the number of energy storage modes computed. The results show that a linear elastic vibration isolation mount should be modeled in SEA analysis and provide the equations for a SEA isolation mount model. Also included is the analysis for three unique SEA connectors, a mount to acoustic volume connector, a beam to <b>mount</b> <b>connector,</b> and a mount to flat plate connector...|$|E

40|$|Today, the use {{of surface}} <b>mount</b> <b>connectors</b> to {{increase}} the component density of printed circuit boards is growing as a total percentage of connectors processed in various printed circuit boards. Resources have been channeled to develop various requirements pertaining to the design and processing of surface <b>mount</b> <b>connectors.</b> This paper summarizes {{some of the key}} developments in relation to the evolution of the pager design. Pagers have become small, cheap and reliable. With the drive towards smaller and slimmer pagers with increased functions, a two-printed-circuit-board-construction is needed for design flexibility due to the great variations in language and feature sets. What you can hold in your hand, you can drop. Therefore the pager (and the connector inside) must be mechanically rugged enough to take the various impacts in the course of its useful life and continue to function as designed. 2 To minimize the void area in the pager, the board-to-board connector stacked height is driven down to the height of the tallest components. Besides switching from through-hole to surface <b>mount</b> technology, <b>connector</b> density has been moved from 1. 27 mm to 1. 0 mm, and gradually to 0. 8 mm and 0. 5 mm pitch {{in order to meet the}} demands for miniaturization. Added to that, connectors also switched from pin-and-socket to blade-on-beam design technology to meet the demand for a robust system that can withstand physical shocks suffered by smaller, denser and more complex pagers. In conclusion, connectors will continue to evolve and remain one of the key elements in the evolution of packaging and interconnect solutions for pagers...|$|R

The signaling data rate achievable in our system is from 1 Gbps to 8. 5 Gbps, which depends on the 3 dB coupling frequency of the composite channel consisting of the inductive interconnections and the transmission lines. Methods to improve signal integrity in inductively coupled systems are established. Options include transformer geometry optimization, integrated series terminations and system level tradeoffs...|$|R

25|$|There {{are three}} card form factors: Type I, Type II, and Type III cards. The card {{connector}} used {{for each type}} include: Type I and II use a 100-pin stacking connector, while Type III uses a 124-pin edge connector, i.e. the connector for Types I and II differs from that for Type III, where the connector is {{on the edge of}} a card, like with a SO-DIMM. The additional 24 pins provide the extra signals required to route I/O back through the system connector (audio, AC-Link, LAN, phone-line interface). Type II cards have RJ11 and RJ45 <b>mounted</b> <b>connectors.</b> These cards must be located at the edge of the computer or docking station so that the RJ11 and RJ45 ports can be mounted for external access.|$|R

50|$|A D-sub {{contains}} {{two or more}} parallel rows of pins or sockets usually surrounded by a D-shaped metal shield that provides mechanical support, ensures correct orientation, and may screen against electromagnetic interference. The part containing pin contacts is called the male connector or plug, while that containing socket contacts is called the female connector or socket. The socket's shield fits tightly inside the plug's shield. Panel <b>mounted</b> <b>connectors</b> usually have threaded nuts that accept screws on the cable end connector cover that are used for locking the connectors together and offering mechanical strain relief. Occasionally the nuts may be found on a cable end connector if {{it is expected to}} connect to another cable end (see the male DE-9 pictured). When screened cables are used, the shields are connected to the overall screens of the cables. This creates an electrically continuous screen covering the whole cable and connector system.|$|R
5000|$|A {{connector}} in a fixed {{location is}} a jack and a moveable connector is a plug. The distinction is relative, so a portable radio is considered stationary {{compared to the}} cable from the headphones; the radio has a jack, and the headphone cable has a plug. Where the relationship is equal, such as when two flexible cables are connected, each is considered a plug. Jacks use the reference designator prefix of J and plugs use the reference designator prefix of P. [...] It is possible {{in the case of}} box <b>mounted</b> <b>connectors</b> for the connector to be a receptacle with male pin contacts. In this case the connector is designated a jack (J ref des) regardless of the contact gender because the housing for the contacts is in fact configured as the receptacle even though its mate (the plug) goes around the receptacle. See MIL-STD-38999 and similar cases.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} H2S {{sets were}} essentially prototype units that were hand-built to equip the Pathfinder Force with all possible speed.

40|$|A <b>connector</b> {{retainer}} and <b>mounting</b> {{system has}} been designed to replace screw-mounting of Winchester connectors. Countersunk screws are normally used to secure connectors to structures, and to keep them from coming apart. These screws are normally put into threaded or through-holes in metallic structures. This unique retainer is designed such that integral posts keep the connector halves retained, and a groove permits a cable tie to be fastened around the retainer and composite tube, thus securing the connector to the structure. The system is compatible for use on cryogenic (and conventional) bonded composite tube assemblies. Screws and tapped/through-holes needed to retain and <b>mount</b> Winchester <b>connectors</b> cannot be used on blind-access composite tubes. This system allows for rapid installation, removal, low-molecular-outgassing materials, and particulate-free installation and removal. Installation and/or changes late in the integration, and test flow with limited access in a cleanroom environment are possible. No sanding or bonding is needed...|$|R
50|$|A cable {{assembly}} is {{the composition of}} one or more electrical cable(s) and one or more connectors.
