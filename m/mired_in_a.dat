5|$|Upon Austria's {{entrance}} into the war in summer 1805, Klenau joined the Habsburg army in southern Germany and became <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> short campaign that exposed {{the worst of the}} Habsburg military organization. Archduke Charles was sick, and had retired to recuperate. Archduke Ferdinand, the brother-in-law of the Emperor Francis, was theoretically in command, but Ferdinand was a poor choice of replacement, having neither experience, maturity, nor aptitude. Although Ferdinand retained nominal command, decisions were placed in the hands of Karl Mack, who was timid, indecisive, and ill-suited for such an important assignment. Furthermore, Mack had been wounded earlier in the campaign, and was unable to take full charge of the army. Consequently, command further devolved to Lieutenant Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, an able military officer, but as yet inexperienced in the command of such a large army.|$|E
5|$|The halt of the Third Army {{during the}} month of September was enough to allow the Germans to {{strengthen}} the fortress of Metz. In October and November, the Third Army was <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> near-stalemate with the Germans during the Battle of Metz, both sides suffering heavy casualties. An attempt by Patton to seize Fort Driant just south of Metz was defeated, but by mid-November Metz had fallen to the Americans. Patton's decisions in taking this city were criticized. German commanders interviewed after the war noted he could have bypassed the city and moved north to Luxembourg where he {{would have been able to}} cut off the German Seventh Army. The German commander of Metz, General Hermann Balck, also noted that a more direct attack would have resulted in a more decisive Allied victory in the city. Historian Carlo D'Este later wrote that the Lorraine Campaign was one of Patton's least successful, faulting him for not deploying his divisions more aggressively and decisively.|$|E
5|$|While Charles Theodore's {{dream of}} a Burgundian renaissance receded, Joseph {{continued}} on his course to annex part of Bavaria. The widow—Max Joseph's widow or the mother-in-law or both—petitioned Prussia on behalf of Charles II August. Frederick's envoys to the heir presumptive convinced this slighted prince to lodge protests with the Imperial Diet in Regensburg. Joseph's troops remained in portions of Bavaria, even establishing an Austrian administration at Straubing, precipitating a diplomatic crisis. Austrian occupation of Bavaria was unacceptable to Charles August's champion, Frederick. Prussian troops mobilized near Prussia's border with Bohemia, reminiscent of the invasion in 1740 that so endangered Maria Theresa's succession to the Habsburg hereditary lands. Meanwhile, the French wriggled out of their diplomatic obligations to Austria, telling Joseph {{that there would be}} no military support from Paris for a war against Prussia. Britain, Prussia's strongest ally, was already <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> war in North America, but Prussia's military had recovered from the Seven Years' War and Frederick did not require any help. Prussia's other ally, Saxony, aligned by two marriages with Charles August, was strategically prepared for war against Austria and ready to contribute twenty thousand troops. Watching from St. Petersburg, Catherine II was willing to mop up the spoils of war for the Russian Empire but did not want to get involved in another costly European conflict.|$|E

25|$|As {{had become}} {{increasingly}} common with sports franchises, the Rams began to blame {{much of their}} misfortune on their stadium situation. With Orange County <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> deep recession resulting largely from defense sector layoffs, the Rams were unable to secure a new or improved stadium in the Los Angeles area, which ultimately cast their future in Southern California into doubt.|$|E
25|$|With the state's {{system of}} fixed {{parliamentary}} terms, the election date was known long in advance, denying the incumbents {{the opportunity to}} set the election date. This {{has the effect of}} lengthening the campaign season beyond the customary one month. The opening shots of the election campaign came in November 2006 as the Iemma government found itself <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> series of ministerial scandals.|$|E
25|$|Krugman {{has done}} much to revive {{discussion}} of the liquidity trap as a topic in economics. He recommended pursuing aggressive fiscal policy and unconventional monetary policy to counter Japan's lost decade in the 1990s, arguing {{that the country was}} <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Keynesian liquidity trap. The debate he started at that time over liquidity traps and what policies best address them continues in the economics literature.|$|E

The Celtics would go just 29-53 on the year, but the young Maxwell's potential, along with the promising addition of Bird and others, {{set the stage for}} what would become an NBA dynasty.|$|R

25|$|In 2009 and 2010, Robinson became <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} {{political}} scandals. In the 2010 general election, however, the Alliance Party candidate and sitting Lord Mayor of Belfast Naomi Long defeated Robinson, in a shock result, more than tripling the Alliance vote {{and giving the}} Alliance their first ever seat in Westminster. Predictably, {{this was also the}} seat in which the Alliance gained the highest share of the vote, at 37.2%, more than double their best efforts elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Krugman {{has since}} drawn {{parallels}} between Japan's 'lost decade' {{and the late}} 2000s recession, arguing that expansionary fiscal policy is necessary as the major industrialized economies are <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> liquidity trap. In response to economists who {{point out that the}} Japanese economy recovered despite not pursuing his policy prescriptions, Krugman maintains that it was an export-led boom that pulled Japan out of its economic slump in the late-90s, rather than reforms of the financial system.|$|E
25|$|In the First Boer War of 1880–81 the Boers of the Transvaal Republic {{had proved}} {{skillful}} fighters in resisting the Britain's attempt at annexation, causing {{a series of}} British defeats. The British government of William Ewart Gladstone had been unwilling to become <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> distant war, requiring substantial troop reinforcement and expense, for what {{was at the time}} perceived to be a minimal return. An armistice followed, ending the war, and subsequently a peace treaty was signed with the Transvaal President Paul Kruger.|$|E

25|$|He {{followed}} {{this with a}} season playing for Edmonton Brickmen before joining the Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the American Soccer League. After a knee injury sidelined him, the Strikers released him. He spent one season (1990) playing for cross-state rivals Tampa Bay {{before returning to the}} Strikers in 1991. By this time the team was playing in the American Professional Soccer League. He was released by the Strikers when the club was <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> four-match scoreless streak to begin the season. In 1992, he injured his other knee while playing in an NASL reunion match between NASL-era Strikers and Rowdies.|$|E
25|$|On 14 March 1960, Stein was {{appointed}} manager of Dunfermline. When Stein {{was appointed}}, the team {{were only two}} points above last place and <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> battle against relegation. The team had not won in four months, but then won their first six matches managed by Stein. To build upon this initial success, Stein signed Willie Cunningham and Tommy McDonald from Leicester City. Dunfermline became a powerful force and Stein guided them to their first Scottish Cup victory in 1961, winning 2–0 in a replayed Final against Celtic. This success prompted job offers from Newcastle United and Hibernian, {{both of which were}} rejected by Stein.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the month, {{arrangements}} for Freud's own departure for London had become stalled, <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> legally tortuous and financially extortionate process of negotiation with the Nazi authorities. The Nazi-appointed Kommissar put in charge of his assets and those of the IPA proved to be sympathetic to Freud's plight. Anton Sauerwald had studied chemistry at Vienna University under Professor Josef Herzig, an old friend of Freud's, and evidently retained, notwithstanding his Nazi Party allegiance, a respect for Freud's professional standing. Expected to disclose details of all Freud's bank accounts to his superiors and to follow their instructions to destroy the historic library of books housed in the offices of the IPA, in the event Sauerwald did neither, removing evidence of Freud's foreign bank accounts to his own safe-keeping and arranging the storage of the IPA library in the Austrian National Library where it remained until {{the end of the}} war.|$|E

25|$|The Senate was {{dominated}} by the Republican Party {{for much of the}} 20th century. Since World War II, the Democrats have only controlled the upper house twice. The first time came in 1965, after the 1964 Presidential Election only for them to lose it in special elections that year. The second time again came to power following the 2008 elections on the coattails of the victory of President Barack Obama. In mid-2009, dissatisfaction by some Democrats in the State Senate along with billionaire Tom Golisano, over the leadership of Senate Majority Leader Malcolm Smith resulted in 2 Democratic Senators joining with the entire Republican caucus to install Senator Dean Skelos as Majority Leader and Temporary President. Over the month of June and July the Senate was <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> leadership crisis that ended with the breakaway Democrats rejoining the caucus in late July. The Democrats maintained their majority throughout the remainder of the 2009–2010 session. Following state elections in 2010, Republicans were able to gain the two seats necessary to again reclaim the majority.|$|E
25|$|The 2004 {{season was}} a disappointing {{year for the}} Blue Jays right from the beginning. They started the season 0–8 at SkyDome and never started a lengthy winning streak. Much of that was due to {{injuries}} to All-Stars Carlos Delgado, Vernon Wells and Roy Halladay among others. Although the additions of starting pitchers Ted Lilly and Miguel Batista and reliever Justin Speier were relatively successful, veteran Pat Hentgen faltered throughout the season and retired on July 24. Rookies and minor league callups David Bush, Jason Frasor, Josh Towers and others filled the void in the rotation and the bullpen; however, inconsistent performances were evident. With the team struggling in last place and <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> five-game losing streak, manager Carlos Tosca was fired on August 8, 2004, {{and was replaced by}} first base coach John Gibbons. Long-time first baseman Carlos Delgado became a free agent in the off-season. Nevertheless, prospects Russ Adams, Gabe Gross, and Alex Ríos provided excitement for the fans. Rookie pitchers David Bush, Gustavo Chacín and Jason Frasor also showed promise for the club's future. The Blue Jays' lone MLB All-Star Game representative was Lilly.|$|E
500|$|The Yankees {{acquired}} Rodriguez {{from the}} Texas Rangers during the 2003–04 offseason. Rodriguez had won two Gold Glove Awards at shortstop {{and was considered}} the best shortstop in baseball. Jeter—who had no Gold Gloves at the time—remained the team's starting shortstop while Rodriguez moved to third base. Rodriguez's fielding range allowed Jeter to cede ground to his right to Rodriguez and cheat to his left: fielding balls hit to his left is a weakness identified by scouts. The 2004 season began with Jeter <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> slump, at one point getting only one hit in a span of 36 at-bats; through April, he batted [...]168.

Chapdelaine is the first francophone head coach in the 62-year history of the Montreal Alouettes franchise. He earned his first win in his first game as head coach against the Toronto Argonauts in front of the first sellout crowd in Montreal since 2010.

500|$|Cameron drew {{inspiration}} for the Aliens story from the Vietnam War, {{a situation in which}} a technologically superior force was <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hostile foreign environment: [...] "Their training and technology are inappropriate for the specifics, and that can be seen as analogous to the inability of superior American firepower to conquer the unseen enemy in Vietnam: a lot of firepower and very little wisdom, and it didn't work." [...] The attitude of the space marines was influenced by the Vietnam War; they are portrayed as cocky and confident of their inevitable victory, but when they find themselves facing a technologically inferior but more determined enemy, the outcome is not what they expect. Cameron listed Robert A.
