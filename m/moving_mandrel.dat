25|$|There {{are five}} types of tube drawing: tube sinking, mandrel drawing, {{stationary}} mandrel, <b>moving</b> <b>mandrel,</b> and floating mandrel. A mandrel {{is used in}} many of the types to prevent buckling or wrinkling in the workpiece.|$|E
50|$|A {{continuous}} {{filament winding machine}} (CFW Machine / CW Machine) is a machine for laying filament windings continuously over a cylindrical steel band. The steel band is carried on a forward <b>moving</b> <b>mandrel</b> which is able to collapse {{and return to the}} beginning of the travel. The steel band is released after the mandrel collapses and is continuously fed back to the start of the travel where it is again wound on to the mandrel.|$|E
40|$|Modeling and {{simulation}} of metal forming processes are increasingly in demand {{from the industry}} as the resulting models {{are found to be}} valuable tools considering the optimization of the existing and development of new processes. By the application of modeling and simulation techniques, it is possible {{to reduce the number of}} time-consuming experiments such as prototyping. Seamless tubes of various sizes and shapes are manufactured by various processes like sinking, fixed plug, floating plug, <b>moving</b> <b>mandrel,</b> cold working and hot working. The present work deals with the {{simulation of}} round tubes while passing through the sink pass, using ANSYS software. The simulation results are the displacement and von Mises stresses. The procedure can be used to improve the product quality and to study the effect of various parameters like die angle on the product quality...|$|E
40|$|Parison {{dimensions}} in {{extrusion blow molding}} are affected by two phenomena, swell due to stress relaxation and sag drawdown due to gravity. It is well established that the parison swell and sag are strongly dependent on the die geometry and the operating conditions. The availability of a modeling technique ensures a more accurate prediction of the entire blow molding process, as the proper prediction of the parison formation is the input for the remaining process phases. This study considers both the simulated and the experimental effects of the die geometry, the operating conditions, and the resin properties on the parison dimensions using high density polyethylene. Parison programming with a <b>moving</b> <b>mandrel</b> and the flow rate evolution in intermittent extrusion are also considered. The parison dimensions are measured experimentally by using the pinchoff mold technique on two industrial scale machines. The finite element software BlowParison developed at IMI is used to predict the parison formation, {{taking into account the}} swell, sag, and nonisothermal effects. The comparison between the predicted parison/part dimensions and the corresponding experimental data demonstrates the efficiency of numerical tools in the prediction of the final part thickness and weight distributions.

40|$|Nowadays {{application}} of light alloys like aluminium in automobile industry {{has found a}} striking role. Higher strength over weight ratio which causes lower fuel consumption {{seems to be the}} first reason. Also some other reasons like ease of manufacturing, protection against corrosion and ease of recycling are other motivations for car designers to use various aluminium alloys as much as possible. Due to lack of variable thickness tubes, they have not found a lot of applications in the car component design. This paper aims to introduce these types of tubes to automotive industry. Also these tubes are one of the essential elements in the complementary processes like tube hydroforming and cause ease of production and decreasing risk of scrap in manufacturing cycles. Tube drawing is one of the mostly used methods for reducing thickness and/or diameter of tubes which, can be classified in four categories like sinking (without mandrel), float mandrel, fixed mandrel and ultrasonically <b>moving</b> <b>mandrel.</b> This paper presents numerical studies that have been done on the drawing tubes with variable thickness. The influence of process variables on material thinning and formability in 63. 5 mm outer diameter, 2. 62 mm wall thickness AA 6063 aluminium alloy tube, were investigated and optimised. Validation of the numerical simulation on the different parameters setting will be performed by comparing the final shape and deformation, measured from the tested part. Acceptable agreement between numerical and experimental results was observed. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
