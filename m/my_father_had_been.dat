60|$|When <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{married a}} little while, {{he took his}} {{youngest}} brother {{to live with him}} as his assistant.|$|E
60|$|This puzzled me yet more; and {{a thought}} coming into my head, I {{asked if he}} and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> twins.|$|E

6000|$|... "Here in Genoa, where I was married; and {{his family}} had lived here generations ago. But <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in various countries." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> pacing {{to and fro}} {{the tiny}} platform. Now {{he came to a}} halt {{opposite}} my mother, placing his hands upon her shoulders.|$|E
60|$|Now <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a {{judge and}} I had a brother who was a barrister; but the madness was upon me and I spoke quickly and convincingly.|$|E
60|$|D'you think I {{can go to}} Oxford {{again when}} <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> tried for forgery? No, no! No, no! I'd rather shoot myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "My father," [...] {{he gasped}} at last. [...] "'Sdeath, sir, {{what is it}} you mean? <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> dead these ten years. I scarce {{remember}} him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> unwell, and I had to {{stay with}} him a few days or I should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> here sooner. You got home all of you quite well?" ...|$|R
60|$|There {{had been}} a rising and a bloody battle at Perugia, Falcone {{informed}} us. An attempt {{had been made to}} overthrow the rule there of Pier Luigi Farnese, Duke of Castro, the pope's own abominable son. For some months <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> enjoying the shelter of the Perugians, and he had repaid their hospitality by joining them and bearing arms with them in the ill-starred blow they struck for liberty. They had been crushed in the encounter by the troops of Pier Luigi, and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> among the slain.|$|E
60|$|A look of pain crossed Mr. Banker's face. He and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> warm friends, and I well {{knew that}} he would do all in his power for me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know this,' said Mrs. Doncastle, {{in great}} anger, 'that if <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in the room, I {{should not have}} let the fact pass unnoticed, and treated him like a stranger!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; this is {{the first}} time <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> out. He went in search of you, to ask how you met poor Arthur, who <b>has</b> <b>been</b> able to give no account of himself.' ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>My</b> <b>Father</b> also <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{interpreted}} as performative. As Andrew Parker describes the term, [...] "performativity has enable a powerful {{appreciation of the}} ways that identities are constructed iteratively through complex citational processes. <b>My</b> <b>Father</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> linked to performativity because of its disruption of the viewers sense of space and time as Kubotas mourning appears to take place as the figure of her father lingers on the television, both present and absent, as a ghost incarnated.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{conceive}} why {{you of all}} {{men should}} call your horse by such a name. If <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> President of the United States, I don't think I'd call a horse President." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I might," [...] he answered, [...] "if I {{had known}} the value of it. I found a cable waiting for me in New York. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> dead a month; and I had to return immediately." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> less obstinate, {{you need}} not have gone; he could have hired a {{professional}} inquiry agent. But you had better not say anything about your object to him--it must be a secret between us." ...|$|E
60|$|This being finally settled, and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> {{pretty well}} {{exhausted}} by his ramble round the farm, I set {{him down on}} the rustic chair with a newspaper and left him, saying that I should be back in an hour or so.|$|R

"The {{only time}} I ever saw Sir Wingrave Seton," [...] she said, [...] "was {{on the day}} before I was told that a {{relation}} of <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> found, who was willing to take charge of me. There was a younger man with him, someone very, very different from Sir Wingrave. Do you know who he was?" ...|$|E
60|$|It chanced {{that the}} farm, of which <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> tenant {{for nearly a}} quarter of a century, was taken by a {{neighbour}} who had no use for the house, and so it was arranged that we should stay on at a merely nominal rent. Then began a chapter of my life without event, which I can pass rapidly over.|$|E
60|$|To my mind {{there was}} no reason why I should be treated as one so far beneath the family. My mother had been a gentlewoman and my father a gentleman, and I was {{conceited}} enough to think that by both breeding and education I was fully the equal of my cousins. Besides, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> well-to-do, and had, no doubt, left me a fair inheritance.|$|E
6000|$|... "With little, I fear," [...] {{answered}} the charming girl, in a low, melancholy tone. [...] "At least, I know that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> disappointed.

6000|$|... "That follows by no means, commodore, as I {{have some}} reason to know; for <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> a parson, and I being a seaman, we may <b>be</b> said to <b>have</b> the whole subject, as it were, in the family. St. Paul-- you have {{heard of such a}} man as St. Paul, commodore?--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes,” {{she said}} slowly; “but there’s a regret. We <b>have</b> <b>been</b> very happy since we left; <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> light-hearted, and I have had him to myself. At home he often has an anxious look, and is always occupied. I have some friends and many acquaintances, but {{now and then}} I feel lonely.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{was proud}} of me. I was big-boned and fair, like my mother. And when I came {{home at the end}} of a Semester I can see him now, as he would hobble to the door, wearing the red and black and gold of the Burschenschaft. And he would keep me up half the night-telling him of our 'Schlager' fights with the aristocrats. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a noted swordsman in his day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If they'd lived now," [...] she concluded, [...] "I feel it wouldn't have happened. People aren't so {{set upon}} tragedy {{as they were}} then. If <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> able to go round the world, or if she'd had a rest cure, {{everything}} would have come right. But what could I do? And then they had bad friends, both of them, who made mischief. Ah, Katharine, when you marry, be quite, quite sure that you love your husband!" ...|$|E
60|$|Resolutely, then, if by slow stages, we pursued our journey, {{and came}} {{at last to}} Montauban. There we lay {{a night at the}} Auberge de Navarre, {{intending}} to push on to Lavedan upon the morrow. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> on more than friendly terms with the Vicomte de Lavedan, and upon this I built my hopes of a cordial welcome and an invitation to delay for a few days the journey to Toulouse, upon which I should represent myself as bound.|$|E
6000|$|... "My sword, madam," [...] {{replied the}} Duke, [...] "like that of <b>my</b> <b>fathers,</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{always at the}} command of my lawful king, and of my native country--I trust it is {{impossible}} to separate their real rights and interests.

6000|$|... "I can't," [...] exclaimed Godfrey {{in a kind}} of wail. [...] "I am to {{be taken}} off to a school in some town or other, I forget which, that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> examining.

6000|$|... "My lord," [...] {{answered}} the Countess, [...] "I {{do not think}} it so. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> long noted a worthy and honourable man; and for Tressilian, if we can pardon ourselves the ill we have wrought him, I will wager the coronet I am to share with you one day that he is incapable of returning injury for injury." ...|$|R
