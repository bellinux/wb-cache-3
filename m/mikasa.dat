5|$|After 1922, <b>Mikasa</b> was {{decommissioned}} {{in accordance}} with the Washington Naval Treaty and preserved as a museum ship at Yokosuka. She was badly neglected during the post-World War II Occupation of Japan and required extensive refurbishing in the late 1950s. She is now fully restored as a museum ship and can be visited at <b>Mikasa</b> Park in Yokosuka.|$|E

50|$|Until the {{marriage}} of the Crown Prince Hirohito (Emperor Shōwa) to Princess Nagako of Kuni (posthumously Empress Kōjun) in January 1924, the principal consorts of emperors and crown princes had always been recruited {{from one of the}} Sekke Fujiwara. Imperial princesses were often married to Fujiwara lords - throughout a millennium at least. As recently as Emperor Shōwa's third daughter, the late former Princess Takanomiya (Kazoku), and Prince <b>Mikasa's</b> elder daughter, the former Princess Yasuko, married into Takatsukasa and Konoe families, respectively. Likewise a daughter of the last Tokugawa Shogun married a second cousin of Emperor Shōwa.|$|R
5|$|<b>Mikasa,</b> {{named after}} Mount <b>Mikasa,</b> was {{laid down by}} Vickers at their Barrow-in-Furness {{shipyard}} on 24 January 1899. She was launched on 8 November 1900 and completed on 1 March 1902. After a visit to Devonport, she left Plymouth on 13 March 1902, bound for Yokohama, {{under the command of}} Captain Hayasaki.|$|E
5|$|Six {{days after}} the Treaty of Portsmouth that ended the war was signed, <b>Mikasa</b> sank at her {{moorings}} after a fire and magazine explosion at Sasebo {{on the night of}} 11/12 September 1905 that killed 251 crewmen. She was refloated on 7 August 1906, reconstructed and repaired at Sasebo Naval Arsenal. The navy took the opportunity to upgrade her existing armament with more powerful 45-calibre twelve-inch and six-inch guns during the two years it took to repair the ship. <b>Mikasa</b> was restored to active service on 24 August 1908. During World War I, she served on coast-defence duties, based at Maizuru, during 1914–15 and was then assigned to the Second and Fifth Squadrons, in that order, {{for the rest of the}} war. The ship supported the Japanese intervention in Siberia during the Russian Civil War during 1921 and was reclassified on 1 September 1921 as a first-class coast-defence ship. On 17 September, <b>Mikasa</b> ran aground near Askold Island off Vladivostok, but was not seriously damaged.|$|E
5|$|After World War I, most battleships, {{dreadnought}} and pre-dreadnought alike, were disarmed {{under the}} terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. Largely this meant the ships being broken up for scrap; others were destroyed in target practice or relegated to training and supply duties. One, <b>Mikasa,</b> was given a special exemption to the Washington Treaty and was maintained as a museum and memorial ship.|$|E

However, they also discover that their race, the Eldians, are being oppressed and persecuted by the Marleyans, the ruling race that {{with the objective of}} conquering their island, Paradis, and seizing their natural resources, have transformed Eldian prisoners into rogue Titans to keep them trapped inside the walls and sent Zeke, Annie, and the other Titan Shifters to steal the Coordinate. In the occasion, Eren also learns that Zeke is his older half-brother, who betrayed their father and defected to the Marleyans. After Wall Maria is reclaimed, Eren and the others make preparations for their imminent confrontation with the Marleyan forces.|$|R

When the Titans invade his town, he is powerless to save her from being devoured by one of the Titans, and vows to kill every Titan henceforth. Enlisting in the military, Eren eventually places fifth overall in his graduating class. Parts of Eren's past are revealed through the series. Following Shingashina's fall, he has a brief encounter with his father Grisha who entrusts him with a key to the basement of their house, and who injects him with a mysterious liquid. When he was nine years old, he and his father were planning to meet <b>Mikasa</b> Ackerman and her family, but they discover that her parents have been killed and that she is held hostage.

25|$|In {{the year}} 1882, the railway of Horonai was {{completed}} (官営幌内鉄道, Kan'ei Horonai Tetsudō), the third railway of the Japanese empire connecting the mine with the Otaru harbor. Also, the government {{decided to build}} the prison of sorachi in <b>Mikasa</b> (空知監獄). Thus the problem of overcrowded prisons {{as well as the}} problem of insufficient labour power in the mine were solved. Between 1883 and 1894, this prison provided an average of 720 prison miners a year, making up 80 percent of the total workforce.|$|E
25|$|Miwa was {{a native}} of Aichi prefecture, and {{graduated}} 59th out of 148 cadets in the 39th class of the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy in 1911.

25|$|In 1868, {{carpenter}} Kimura Kichitarō (木村 吉太郎) discovered coal in Horonai, <b>Mikasa</b> (三 笠). However, it {{took another}} 6 years before Chōjūrō Hayakawa a citizen of Sapporo, delivered the first coal to the colonization commission (開拓使, Kaitakushi). The local government took action, and the mining engineers Benjamin Smith Lyman and Takeaki Enomoto welded an investigation. Their findings were satisfactory, and the Meiji government decided to build in Horonai the first coal mine of the Ishikari coal basin. The construction of the mine was led by the American engineer L.C.E. Goujot and his disciple Edward Parry. The first adit, the Daikōdō (大抗道, big adit) was opened in 1879. It {{was followed by the}} opening of the Takinosawa adit (瀧ノ沢抗) and Honsawa adit (本沢抗) in 1882, which meant the start of the coal production.|$|E
25|$|During a mission, Eren is {{swallowed}} by a Titan when he sacrifices himself {{to save his}} friend Armin Arlert. Inside the Titan, however, he suddenly transforms into a 15-meter class Titan that attacks the other Titans and disregards humans before the Titan collapses and his real body is exposed, unconscious, {{at the back of}} the neck. Though he is distrusted initially by the military, especially due to his inability to control himself in Titan form, Eren earns a place in the Special Operations Squad, a branch of Survey Corps under Levi assigned to watch over him. Shortly after joining, Eren finds himself hunted by a female Titan who kills all of his squadmates to get to him. With help of Levi and <b>Mikasa,</b> Eren is saved from the Titan who is later revealed to be Annie Leonhart. Though Eren defeats Annie alongside his allies, they are unable to get answers as they watch her encase herself using her Titan's hardening ability.|$|E

However, {{at the request}} of the Japanese government, each of the signatory countries to the treaty agreed that <b>Mikasa</b> could be preserved as a memorial ship with her hull encased in concrete. On 12 November 1926, <b>Mikasa</b> was opened for display in Yokosuka in the presence of Crown Prince Hirohito and Tōgō. Following the surrender of Japan in 1945, the ship deteriorated under control of the occupation forces, but was restored after another campaign led by the Japan Times and Fleet Admiral Chester W.

500|$|Although not an {{official}} national flag, the Z signal flag {{played a major}} role in Japanese naval history. On May 27, 1905, Admiral Heihachirō Tōgō of the <b>Mikasa</b> was preparing to engage the Russian Baltic Fleet. Before the Battle of Tsushima began, Togo raised the Z flag on the <b>Mikasa</b> and engaged the Russian fleet, winning the battle for Japan. The raising of the flag said to the crew the following: [...] "The fate of Imperial Japan hangs on this one battle; all hands will exert themselves and do their best." [...] The Z flag was also raised on the aircraft carrier Akagi on the eve of the Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in December 1941.|$|E
500|$|At the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905, <b>Mikasa</b> again led the 1st Fleet into combat, {{this time}} against the Second and Third Pacific Squadrons {{detached}} from the Baltic Fleet. The ship opened fire at the battleship , the Russian flagship, at 14:10, and was joined by the battleship [...] and the armoured cruiser [...] shortly afterwards. Within an hour the Japanese ships had started a serious fire aboard the Russian ship, badly wounded the fleet commander, Vice Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky, knocked out her rear twelve-inch gun turret, and jammed Knyaz Suvorovs steering so that she fell out of formation. During this time, <b>Mikasa</b> {{was the focus of}} the Russian fire as the leading ship in the Japanese column and was hit by 6 twelve-inch and 19 six-inch shells. They did very little damage and Tōgō was able to cross the T of the Russian squadrons. Knyaz Suvorovs steering was later repaired, but she blundered between the Japanese and Russian fleets several times later in the battle and <b>Mikasa</b> fired three torpedoes at her to no avail. Later in the battle, the ship appears to have fired mostly on the battleship [...] although [...] fired the shots that caused the Russian ship's magazines to explode and sink her. At 18:04, a twelve-inch shell detonated prematurely in the barrel of the right gun of the forward turret, disabling the gun and knocking out the left gun until 18:40. Another twelve-inch shell had exploded in that same barrel almost two hours earlier, but had not damaged the gun. One six-inch gun jammed after firing 19 rounds, but the only other damage to any of the ship's guns was one six-inch gun that was disabled by a Russian shell of the same size that entered through the gunport. She fired 124 twelve-inch shells during the battle, more than any other ship except Asahis 142. In total, <b>Mikasa</b> was hit more than 40 times during the battle, including 10 twelve-inch and 22 six-inch shells, but none of them seriously damaged her. While Mikasas casualties are not precisely known, the entire Japanese force combined only lost 110 men killed and 590 wounded to all causes during the battle.|$|E

500|$|As {{with the}} earlier [...] and s, Japan lacked the {{technology}} and capability to construct its own battleships, and turned again to the United Kingdom for the four remaining battleships of the programme. <b>Mikasa,</b> the last of these ships, was ordered from the Vickers shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness in 1898 {{at the cost of}} £880,000 (8.8 million yen at that time). Although she closely resembled several of the other ships ordered in this program, she was the only ship in her class.|$|E

500|$|Poltava was {{sixth in}} the column of Russian ships when the Japanese engaged them, and from her {{position}} started to bombard [...] at around 14:45. The battleship , the Japanese flagship, then fired several shots that hit Poltava, causing the Russian squadron to drop back to support her. The Russians scored several hits on <b>Mikasa,</b> including two by Poltava. She also scored one hit on the armored cruiser [...] Owing to the damage <b>Mikasa</b> had sustained, the Japanese fleet broke off the attack at around 15:20 and turned to starboard, opening the range. By 17:35 the Japanese were again closing on the Russian rear. <b>Mikasa</b> and three other battleships opened fire on Poltava and three armored cruisers, but problems with their turrets forced the Japanese battleships to break off the engagement. They returned at 18:30, with [...] and Asahi firing on Poltava. As the Russian fleet began to slip away, two 12-inch shells from Asahi penetrated the conning tower of the Russian flagship , killing Vitgeft and the helmsman, severely wounding the captain, and causing the ship {{to come to a}} dead stop after executing a sharp turn. Thinking that this was a maneuver planned by Vitgeft, the Russian line started to execute the same turn, causing all of the ships directly behind Tsesarevich, including Poltava, to maneuver wildly to avoid hitting the stationary flagship. Rear Admiral Prince Pavel Ukhtomsky, second in command of the squadron, signaled the other Russian ships to steam back to Port Arthur. The signal flags were only gradually recognized by Pobeda, Sevastopol, Pallada and Poltava and the other vessels took some time to re-form for the return voyage. Poltava was hit by 12 to 14 large-caliber shells during the battle that knocked out five of her 6-inch guns, as well as killing 12 crewmen and wounding 43. Poltava, along with Tsesarevich and , sustained hits at the waterline that crippled their maneuverability, [...] preventing the Russian squadron from fleeing to Vladivostok.|$|E
500|$|Knyaz Suvorov never regained her {{position}} in the battle line and was engaged at short range by <b>Mikasa</b> and the battleship [...] as well as five cruisers of Vice Admiral Kamimura Hikonojō's 2nd Division between 15:20 and 15:35. <b>Mikasa</b> {{and two of the}} cruisers fired one torpedo each at her during this time, but none of them hit the ship. At 15:39, the unprotected cruiser [...] fired a pair of torpedoes and claimed one hit although no change was visible in Knyaz Suvorovs condition. Chihaya was hit by one shell just above the waterline during her attack that forced her to make emergency repairs. Around 15:40 the British observer aboard Azuma reported that Knyaz Suvorov was down by the bow with a heavy list to port and was a mass of thick gray smoke from forecastle to mainmast. By this time, the ship's forward 12-inch gun turret had been knocked out, but some smaller guns were still in action. The Japanese 5th Destroyer Division attacked five minutes later with torpedoes at ranges under , but failed to score any hits with their five torpedoes. The destroyer leader was hit in the boiler room by a three-inch shell that may have been fired by Knyaz Suvorov.|$|E
500|$|During the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August, <b>Mikasa</b> was at {{the head}} of the column of Japanese battleships and was one of the primary targets of the Russian ships. She was hit twenty times, two of which knocked out her aft 12-inch gun turret, and {{suffered}} 125 casualties among her crew. In turn, she concentrated most of her fire upon the battleships [...] and [...] although both ships were only lightly damaged by the Japanese shells which generally failed to penetrate any armour and detonated on impact.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the Russo-Japanese War, <b>Mikasa,</b> {{commanded}} by Captain Hikojirō Ijichi, was assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet. She participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904 when Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō led the 1st Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur. Tōgō had expected his surprise night attack on the Russians by his destroyers to be much more successful than it actually was and expected to find them badly disorganized and weakened, but the Russians had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The Japanese ships were spotted by the cruiser [...] which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defences. Tōgō chose to attack the Russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the Russian ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a bad idea as the Japanese [...] and six-inch guns inflicted very little significant damage on the Russian ships who concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect. Although a large number of ships on both sides were hit, Russian casualties numbered only 17 while the Japanese suffered 60 killed and wounded before Tōgō disengaged. <b>Mikasa</b> was hit by two ten-inch shells during the engagement that wounded seven crewmen.|$|E
