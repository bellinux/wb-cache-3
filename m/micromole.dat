50|$|Nutrient pollution, {{particularly}} {{nitrogen and}} phosphorus can cause eutrophication, upsetting {{the balance of the}} reef by enhancing algal growth and crowding out corals. This nutrient-rich water can enable blooms of fleshy algae and phytoplankton to thrive off coasts. These blooms can create hypoxic conditions by using all available oxygen. Biologically available nitrogen (nitrate plus ammonia) needs to be below 1.0 <b>micromole</b> per liter (less than 0.014 parts per million of nitrogen), and biologically available phosphorus (orthophosphate plus dissolved organic phosphorus) needs to be below 0.1 <b>micromole</b> per liter (less than 0.003 parts per million of phosphorus). In addition concentrations of chlorophyll (in the microscopic plants called phytoplankton) needs to be below 0.5 parts per billion. Both plants also obscure sunlight, killing both fish and coral. High nitrate levels are specifically toxic to corals, while phosphates slow down skeletal growth.|$|E

Lighting was provided with fluorescent lamps as a 12 h photoperiod with 300 <b>micromoles</b> m- 2 s- 1 PAR. Mid-day stomatal conductances for potato were greatest at 400 and 10000 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1 and least at 1000 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1 CO 2. Mid-day conductances for wheat were greatest at 400 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1 and least at 1000 and 10000 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1 CO 2. Mid-dark period conductances for potato were significantly greater at 10000 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1 than at 400 or 1000 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1, whereas dark conductance for wheat was similar in all CO 2 treatments. Temporarily changing the CO 2 concentration from the native 1000 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1 to 400 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1 increased mid-day conductance for all species, while temporarily changing from 1000 to 10000 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1 also increased conductance for potato and sweetpotato. Temporarily changing the dark period CO 2 from 1000 to 10000 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1 increased conductance for potato, soybean and sweetpotato. In all cases, the stomatal responses were reversible, i. e. conductances returned to original rates following temporary changes in CO 2 concentration. Canopy water use for potato was greatest at 10000, intermediate at 400, and least at 1000 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1 CO 2, whereas canopy water use for wheat was greatest at 400 and similar at 1000 and 10000 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1 CO 2. Elevated CO 2 treatments (i. e. 1000 and 10000 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1) resulted in increased plant biomass for both wheat and potato relative to 400 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1, and no injurious effects were apparent from the 10000 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1 treatment. Results indicate that super-elevated CO 2 (i. e. 10000 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1) can increase stomatal conductance in some species, {{particularly during the}} dark period, resulting in increased water use and decreased water use efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{elevated}} CO 2 on growth, pod, and seed yield, and gas exchange of 'Georgia Red' peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) were evaluated under controlled environmental conditions. Plants {{were exposed to}} concentrations of 400 (ambient), 800, and 1200 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1 CO 2 in reach-in growth chambers. Foliage fresh and dry weights increased with increased CO 2 up to 800 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1, but declined at 1200 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1. The number and the fresh and dry weights of pods also increased with increasing CO 2 concentration. However, the yield of immature pods was not significantly influenced by increased CO 2. Total seed yield increased 33 % from ambient to 800 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1 CO 2, and 4 % from 800 to 1200 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1 CO 2. Harvest index increased with increasing CO 2. Branch length increased while specific leaf area decreased linearly as CO 2 increased from ambient to 1200 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1. Net photosynthetic rate was highest among plants grown at 800 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1. Stomatal conductance decreased with increased CO 2. Carboxylation efficiency was similar among plants grown at 400 and 800 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1 and decreased at 1200 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1 CO 2. These results suggest that CO 2 enrichment from 400 to 800 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1 had positive effects on peanut growth and yield, but above 800 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1 enrichment seed yield increased only marginally...|$|R

We {{have examined the}} fluence-response, time-course, and reciprocity characteristics of four nuclear, blue-light-regulated transcripts in Pisum sativum L. var Alaska: Cab RNA, pEA 207 RNA, pEA 215 RNA, and pEA 25 RNA. To avoid complications due to blue-light-induced transformation of phytochrome, we have adapted the procedure of measuring blue-light-induced changes in steady-state-RNA levels in seedlings grown in continuous red light. The fluence-response curves for Cab and pEA 215 RNA are bell-shaped, with peak accumulations at 102 and 101 <b>micromoles</b> per square meter, respectively. No response is observed at 104 <b>micromoles</b> per square meter. pEA 25 RNA has threshold and saturation fluences below 10 − 1 <b>micromoles</b> per square meter. pEA 207 RNA has a threshold at 102 <b>micromoles</b> per square meter and saturates above 104 <b>micromoles</b> per square meter. pEA 215 and Cab RNA start to increase within 1 hour after the 101 <b>micromoles</b> per square meter pulse, and finish accumulation by 5 hours. The decrease in pEA 207 RNA in response to 104 <b>micromoles</b> per square meter and pEA 25 RNA in response to 101 or 104 <b>micromoles</b> per square meter starts between 3 and 5 hours after the blue-light pulse.

40|$|The N,N'-bis-(4 -trifluoromethylphenyl) -urea is {{demonstrated}} to {{be a powerful}} uncoupler of ATP formation in plant mitochondria and thylakoid membranes. In mitochondria, the full uncoupling effect was obtained at a concentration of 3 <b>micromole</b> uncoupling agent in the medium, which corresponded to an inner mitochondrial concentration of 7. 2 nmol uncoupling agent mg- 1 protein. The full uncoupling concentration was displaced from 3 to 0. 6 <b>micromole</b> when bovine serum albumin was omitted from the reaction medium. Up to 10 <b>micromole,</b> the studied compound acted as a strictly selective uncoupler. At concentrations higher than 10 <b>micromole,</b> a selective inhibition of electron transfer occurred {{at the level of the}} external NADH dehydrogenase of the inner mitochondrial membrane; the I 50 value was 25 <b>micromole.</b> In thylakoid membranes, the full uncoupling effect was obtained for a concentration of 0. 6 <b>micromole</b> uncoupling agent in the medium, which corresponded to a concentration of 25 nmol uncoupling agent mg- 1 chlorophyll. The addition of bovine serum albumin (0. 1 %) to the reaction medium reversed this effect. For concentrations greater than 2 <b>micromole,</b> inhibition of PSII electron transfer was observed. Full inhibition was obtained at 15 <b>micromole</b> uncoupling agent and corresponded to 650 nmol uncoupling agent mg- 1 chlorophyll. In marked contrast with classical uncouplers such as CCCP (m-chlorophenylhydrazone) or substituted phenols, the N,N'-bis-(4 - trifluoromethylphenyl) -urea cannot be classified among the protonophoric class of uncouplers, due to its inability to exchange protons at pHs between 2 and 9. Its uncoupling action must therefore be attributed either to conformational changes of a transmembrane protein present both in mitochondria and in thylakoid membranes, or to a modification of the arrangement of the phospholipid membrane bilayers...|$|E
40|$|Kalanchoë daigremontiana, {{a species}} {{possessing}} crassulacean acid metabolism, was grown at four photon flux densities (1300, 400, 60, and 25 <b>micromole</b> photons per square meter per second). In leaves which had developed at 1300 and 400 <b>micromole</b> photons per square meter per second, CO 2 was mainly incorporated through the lower, shaded leaf surfaces, and the chlorenchyma {{adjacent to the}} lower surfaces showed {{a higher degree of}} nocturnal acid synthesis than the chlorenchyma adjacent to the upper surfaces. In leaves acclimated to 60 and 25 <b>micromole</b> photons per square meter per second, the gradient in CAM activity was reversed, i. e. more CO 2 was taken up through the upper than through the lower surfaces and nocturnal acidification was higher in the tissue next to the upper surfaces. Total net carbon gain and total nocturnal acid synthesis were highest in leaves which had developed at 400 <b>micromole</b> photons per square meter per second. Chlorophyll content was markedly reduced in leaves which had developed at 1300 <b>micromole</b> photons per square meter per second, especially in the exposed adaxial parts. There was also a sustained reduction in photosystem II photochemical efficiency as indicated by measurements of the ratio of variable over maximum chlorophyll a fluorescence. These findings suggest that, at high growth photon flux densities, the reduced activity of the exposed portions of these succulent leaves is caused by (a) the adverse effects of excess light, (b) together with a genotypic component which favors CO 2 uptake and acid synthesis in the abaxial (lower) leaf parts even when light is not or only marginally excessive. This latter component is predominant at medium photon flux densities, e. g. at 400 <b>micromole</b> photons per square meter per second. It becomes overridden, however, under conditions of deep shade when strongly reduced light levels in the abaxial parts of the leaf chlorenchyma severely limit photosynthesis...|$|E

Treatments included: (a) continuous photosynthetic photon flux of 200 <b>micromoles</b> per square meter per second cool-white fluorescent (CWF); (b) continuous 400 <b>micromoles</b> per square meter per second CWF; (c) 12 hours 400 <b>micromoles</b> per square meter per second CWF plus 12 hours dim CWF at 5 <b>micromoles</b> per square meter per second; (d) 12 hours [400] <b>micromoles</b> per square meter per second CWF plus 12 hours dim incandescent (INC) at 5 <b>micromoles</b> per square meter per second and a control treatment of 12 hours light at 400 <b>micromoles</b> per square meter per second CWF and 12 hours dark. The study included five cultivars ranging from early- to late-season types: 'Norland,' 'Superior,''Norchip,' 'Russet Burbank,' and 'Kennebec,' Tuber development progressed well under continuous irradiation at 400 <b>micromoles</b> per square meter per second and under 12 hours irradiance and 12 hours dark, while tuber development was suppressed in all other light treatments. Continuous irradiation at 200 or 400 <b>micromoles</b> per square meter per second resulted in severe stunting and leaf malformation on 'Superior' and 'Kennebec' plants, but little or no injury and vigorous shoot growth in the other cultivars. No injury or stunting were apparent under 12 -dim light or 12 -dark treatments. Plants given 12 hours dim INC showed significantly greater stem elongation but less total biomass than plants in other treatments. The continuous light encouraged shoot growth over tuber growth but this trend was overridden by providing a high irradiance level. The variation among cultivars for tolerance to continuous lighting indicates that potato may be a useful species for photoinhibition studies...|$|R

All of the CaM antagonists used in these studies delayed gravity-induced curvature at a concentration (1 <b>micromole)</b> that did not affect root growth. Calmodulin antagonists (> or = 1 <b>micromole)</b> inhibited downward transport of label from 45 Ca 2 + across the caps of gravistimulated roots relative to the downward transport of 45 Ca 2 + in gravistimulated roots which were not treated with CaM antagonists. Application of CaM antagonists at the root tip (> or = 1 <b>micromole)</b> also decreased the relative downward movement of label from 3 H-IAA applied to the upper side of the elongation zone of gravistimulated roots. In general, tip application of antagonists inhibited neither the upward transport of 45 Ca 2 + in the root tip nor the upward movement of label from 3 H-IAA in the elongation zone of gravistimulated roots. Thus, roots treated with CaM antagonists > or = 1 <b>micromole</b> become less graviresponsive and exhibit reduced or even a reversal of downward polarity of calcium transport across the root tip and IAA transport across the elongation zone. The results indicate that calmodulin-regulated events play a role in root gravitropism...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} changes in {{carbohydrate}} status on the synthesis of specific proteins was investigated in millet (Pennisetum americanum L., Leeke, Tift 23 B 1 E 1) seedlings grown in sterile solution culture. Carbohydrate status was altered by extended darkness and sucrose feeding. Root proteins from intact seedlings were labeled with [35 S]methionine, phenol-extracted, separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography. In four separate experiments, two proteins showed a consistent change in labeling when root carbohydrate levels were varied between 200 and 1000 <b>micromole</b> hexose per gram residual dry weight. Labeling of the first protein (P 47, Mr 47 kD) increased as the carbohydrate levels rose above 500 <b>micromole</b> hexose per gram residual dry weight. Labeling of the second protein (P 34, Mr 34 kD) increased as carbohydrate levels declined from 500 to 200 <b>micromole</b> hexose per gram residual dry weight. Under extreme conditions, when carbohydrate levels fell below 100 <b>micromole</b> hexose per gram residual dry weight, the labeling pattern of most proteins was drastically altered. It is suggested that P 47 and P 34 are `carbohydrate responsive proteins,' i. e. proteins whose concentrations are controlled {{either directly or indirectly}} by tissue carbohydrate status. In contrast, the changes in protein labeling that occur once carbohydrate pools are depleted may be involved in adaptation to periods of prolonged starvation...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} {{between the amount of}} light and the amount of response for any photobiological process can be {{based on the number of}} incident quanta per unit time (fluence rate-response) or on the number of incident quanta during a given period of irradiation (fluence-response). Fluence-response and fluence rate-response relationships have been measured for second positive phototropism by seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana. The fluence-response relationships exhibit a single limiting threshold at about 0. 01 <b>micromole</b> per square meter when measured at fluence rates from 2. 4 × 10 − 5 to 6. 5 × 10 − 3 micromoles per square meter per second. The threshold values in the fluence rateresponse curves decrease with increasing time of irradiation, but show a common fluence threshold at about 0. 01 <b>micromole</b> per square meter. These thresholds are the same as the threshold of about 0. 01 <b>micromole</b> per square meter measured for first positive phototropism. Based on these data, it is suggested that second positive curvature has a threshold in time of about 10 minutes. Moreover, if the times of irradiation exceed the time threshold, there is a single limiting fluence threshold at about 0. 01 <b>micromole</b> per square meter. Thus, the limiting fluence threshold for second positive phototropism is the same as the fluence threshold for first positive phototropism. Based on these data, we suggest that this common fluence threshold for first positive and second positive phototropism is set by a single photoreceptor pigment system...|$|E

Photosynthetically active radiation (400 - 700 nm) was attenuated slightly faster through canopies grown in 360 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1 than through canopies grown in 1200 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1, even though high-CO 2 canopies attained larger leaf area indices. Tissue fractions were sampled from each 5 -cm layer of the canopies. Leaf tissue sampled from the tops of canopies grown in 1200 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1 accumulated significantly more total non-structural carbohydrate, starch, fructan, sucrose, and glucose (p < 0. 05) than for canopies grown in 360 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1. Non-structural carbohydrate did not significantly increase in the lower canopy layers of the elevated CO 2 treatment. Elevated CO 2 induced fructan synthesis in all leaf tissue fractions, but fructan formation was greatest in the uppermost leaf area. A moderate temperature reduction of 10 degrees C over 5 d increased starch, fructan and glucose levels in canopies grown in 1200 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1, but concentrations of sucrose and fructose decreased slightly or remained unchanged.

To avoid the complication of blue-light-induced transformation of phytochrome we have adapted the procedure of measuring blue-light-induced suppression of stem elongation in Pisum sativum L. var Alaska grown under continuous red light. The resulting fluence-response curve for suppression of epicotyl elongation measured twenty-four hours after a blue-light treatment is bell-shaped, with the peak of suppression between 100 and 101 <b>micromoles</b> per square meter, and no suppression at 104 <b>micromoles</b> per square meter. Suppression is first observed 5 and 11 hours after the blue-light treatment for the fourth and third internodes, respectively.

Level of photon flux (PPF) influenced {{the type and}} extent of plant response to mechanical stress. Plant parts responded differently as PPF varied between 135 and 592 <b>micromoles</b> m- 2 s- 1. Stem length was significantly reduced by seismic stress at 135 <b>micromoles</b> m- 2 s- 1 but this effect was insignificant at higher PPFs. Reduced stem length resulted from an inhibition of internode elongation. Stem diameter was unaffected by stress at the PPFs tested. In contrast to effects on stem elongation, leaf area was insensitive to stress treatments at 135 <b>micromoles</b> m- 2 s- 1 but was progressively inhibited by stress as PPF increased. Statistically significant reductions in shoot f. wt and d. wt by seismic stress occurred only at 295 <b>micromoles</b> m- 2 s- 1.

While leaf water potential fell and leaf kill progressed, the betaine (trimethylglycine) {{content of the}} second leaf blade rose from about 0. 4 <b>micromole</b> to about 1. 5 micromoles in 4 days. The time course of betaine accumulation resembled that of proline accumulation. Choline levels in unstressed second leaf blades were low (< 0. 1 <b>micromole</b> per blade) and remained low during water stress. Upon relief of stress, betaine-like proline—remained at a high concentration in drought-killed leaf zones, but betaine did not disappear as rapidly as proline from viable leaf tissue during recovery...|$|E

40|$|Abstract To obtain more {{knowledge}} about carbon requirements for growth by sponges, the growth rate, respiration rate, and clearance rate {{was measured in}} situ in Haliclona oculata. We found that only 34 % of the particulate carbon pumped through the sponge was used for both respiration and growth. The net growth efficiency, being the ratio of carbon incorporated in biomass and the total carbon used by the sponge for respiration and growth, {{was found to be}} 0. 099 ± 0. 013. Thus, about 10 % of the total used carbon was fixed in biomass, and over 90 % was used for generating energy for growth, maintenance, reproduction, and pumping. H. oculata had 2. 5 μmol C available for every <b>micromole</b> O 2 consumed. A value of 0. 75 for respiratory quotient (RQ in <b>micromole</b> CO 2 <b>micromole</b> O 2 − 1) was used for H. oculata, which is the average value reported in literature for different marine invertebrates. Thus, carbon was available in excess to meet the respiratory demand. Oxygen was found not to be the limiting factor for growth, since only 3. 3 % of the oxygen pumped through the sponge body was used. Our results indicate that both oxygen and carbon availability are not limiting. The low growth efficiency agrees with the low growth rates found for the species used in this study...|$|E

40|$|Although {{terrestrial}} atmospheric CO 2 levels {{will not}} reach 1000 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1 (0. 1 %) for decades, CO 2 levels in growth chambers and greenhouses routinely exceed that concentration. CO 2 levels in {{life support systems}} in space can exceed 10000 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1 (1 %). Numerous studies have examined CO 2 effects up to 1000 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1, but biochemical measurements indicate that the beneficial effects of CO 2 can continue beyond this concentration. We studied the effects of near-optimal (approximately 1200 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1) and super-optimal CO 2 levels (2400 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1) on yield of two cultivars of hydroponically grown wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in 12 trials in growth chambers. Increasing CO 2 from sub-optimal to near-optimal (350 - 1200 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1) increased vegetative growth by 25 % and seed yield by 15 % in both cultivars. Yield increases were primarily {{the result of an}} increased number of heads per square meter. Further elevation of CO 2 to 2500 <b>micromoles</b> mol- 1 reduced seed yield by 22 % (P < 0. 001) in cv. Veery- 10 and by 15 % (P < 0. 001) in cv. USU-Apogee. Super-optimal CO 2 did not decrease the number of heads per square meter, but reduced seeds per head by 10 % and mass per seed by 11 %. The toxic effect of CO 2 was similar over a range of light levels from half to full sunlight. Subsequent trials revealed that super-optimal CO 2 during the interval between 2 wk before and after anthesis mimicked the effect of constant super-optimal CO 2. Furthermore, near-optimal CO 2 during the same interval mimicked the effect of constant near-optimal CO 2. Nutrient concentration of leaves and heads was not affected by CO 2. These results suggest that super-optimal CO 2 inhibits some process that occurs near the time of seed set resulting in decreased seed set, seed mass, and yield...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the extent that NO 3 − taken up in the dark was assimilated and utilized differently by plants than NO 3 − taken up in the light. Vegetative, nonnodulated soybean plants (Glycine max L. Merrill, `Ransom') were exposed to 15 NO 3 − throughout light (9 hours) or dark (15 hours) phases of the photoperiod and then returned to solutions containing 14 NO 3 −, with plants sampled subsequently at each light/dark transition over 3 days. The rates of 15 NO 3 − absorption were nearly equal in the light and dark (8. 42 and 7. 93 <b>micromoles</b> per hour, respectively); however, the whole-plant rate of 15 NO 3 − reduction during the dark uptake period (2. 58 <b>micromoles</b> per hour) was 46 % of that in the light (5. 63 <b>micromoles</b> per hour). The lower rate of reduction in the dark was associated with both substantial retention of absorbed 15 NO 3 − in roots and decreased efficiency of reduction of 15 NO 3 − in the shoot. The rate of incorporation of 15 N into the insoluble reduced-N fraction of roots in darkness (1. 10 <b>micromoles</b> per hour) was somewhat greater than that in the light (0. 92 <b>micromoles</b> per hour), despite the lower rate of whole-plant 15 NO 3 − reduction in darkness...|$|R
