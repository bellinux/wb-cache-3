5000|$|Packages of light, mild, and low-tar {{cigarettes}} are often labeled as being [...] "lower tar and nicotine" [...] and also list tar and nicotine levels that {{are lower than}} those found on the packages of regular cigarettes. The lower tar and nicotine numbers found on cigarette packages represent the levels produced when machine [...] "smoked" [...] by a smoking <b>machine</b> <b>test</b> method. [...] Developed by the FTC in 1967, the smoking <b>machine</b> <b>test</b> method was created to determine the yield of a cigarette by [...] "smoking" [...] it in a standardized fashion by machine; this test method {{is also known as}} the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) machine-smoking method. While the FTC has always recognized that the smoking machine did not replicate human smoking and that no two human smokers smoke in the same way, the FTC did not initially recognize the tobacco industry's ability to design cigarettes that yielded low levels of tar and nicotine when machine-smoked, but yielded much higher levels when smoked by a human being.|$|E
5000|$|Light {{cigarettes}} essentially fool smoking machines {{through several}} techniques. A light cigarette's filter perforated by tiny holes, for instance, is uncovered when smoked by machine, and consequently, the cigarette smoke is heavily diluted with air and causes the machines to report {{low levels of}} nicotine and tar. When smoked by human smokers, in contrast, this filter is usually covered by smokers' lips and fingers. Consequently, the filter holes are covered and the light cigarette actually becomes equivalent to a regular cigarette. [...] Some tobacco manufacturers also increased {{the length of the}} paper wrap which covers the cigarette filter; this modification serves to decrease the number of [...] "puffs" [...] available to the <b>machine</b> <b>test</b> and limits the amount of tobacco that is machine [...] "smoked". In reality, however, the tobacco found under this paper wrap which is not [...] "smoked" [...] by machine is still available to and smoked by the human smoker.|$|E

50|$|Dynamic balance {{describes}} the forces generated by asymmetric mass distribution when the tire is rotated, usually {{at a high}} speed. In the tire factory, the tire and wheel are mounted on a balancing <b>machine</b> <b>test</b> wheel, the assembly is accelerated up to a speed of 100 RPM (10 to 15 mph with recent high sensitivity sensors) or higher, 300 RPM (55 to 60 mph with typical low sensitivity sensors), and forces of unbalance are measured by sensors as the tire rotates. These forces are resolved into static and couple values for {{the inner and outer}} planes of the wheel, and compared to the unbalance tolerance (the maximum allowable manufacturing limits). If the tire is not checked, {{it has the potential to}} wobble and perform poorly. In tire retail shops, tire/wheel assemblies are checked on a spin-balancer, which determines the amount and angle of unbalance. Balance weights are then fitted to the outer and inner flanges of the wheel. Dynamic balance is better (it is more comprehensive) than static balance alone, because both couple and static forces are measured and corrected.|$|E

40|$|Many {{researches}} have debated {{that the}} current 2 -wire drop test method (AS/NZS 4499. 1 : 1997 and AS/NZS 2512. 3. 2 : 1997) for cricket helmets does not adequately represent the dynamics of a real ball-helmet impact for fast, elite and express bowlers. This paper presents a new pitching <b>machine</b> <b>test</b> method that was developed to measure the impact performance of cricket helmets. A series of accelerometers were positioned at the centre of gravity (CG) of the test headform to measure the linear accelerations in x-, y- and z-directions due to impact by a cricket ball. The Head Injury Criterion (HIC) was calculated based on the resulting head acceleration (Hres), and impact duration. When compared with the bare headform impacts, the tested helmets were able to reduce the Hres by 25 % and 60 % for the 2 -wire drop test and pitching machine respectively. Similarly, the tested helmets reduced the HIC values by about 82 % and 83 % for the 2 -wire drop test and pitching machine respectively. However, the Hres and HIC values measured using the 2 -wire drop tests were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than those measured using the pitching <b>machine</b> <b>test.</b> These differences were attributed largely to {{the differences in the}} masses of the test apparatus and the resultant impact energy, which was calculated based on the measured impact velocities and impactor mass. The repeatability of results obtained from the pitching machine may, however, be degraded at high velocity impacts due to the test set- up. For the time being, the developed pitching <b>machine</b> <b>test</b> is intended to supplement, but not to replace, the currently accepted cricket helmet standard test method...|$|E
