2500|$|In {{the course}} of this journey, he met Mark Twain in Elmira, New York, and was deeply impressed. Kipling arrived unannounced at Twain's home, and later wrote that as he rang the doorbell, [...] "It {{occurred}} to <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time that Mark Twain might possibly have other engagements other than the entertainment of escaped lunatics from India, be they ever so full of admiration." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{positive}} review for Time, Richard Corliss called The Passion of the Christ [...] "a serious, handsome, excruciating film that radiates total commitment." [...] New York Press film critic Armond White praised Gibson's direction, comparing him to Carl Theodor Dreyer in how he transformed art into spirituality. Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun-Times gave the movie {{four out of}} four stars, calling it [...] "the most violent film [...] ha ever seen" [...] as well as reflecting on how the film personally impacted him as a former altar boy saying [...] "What Gibson has provided for <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time in my life, is a visceral {{idea of what the}} Passion consisted of. That his film is superficial in terms of the surrounding message -- that we get only a few passing references to the teachings of Jesus -- is, I suppose, not the point. This is not a sermon or a homily, but a visualization of the central event in the Christian religion. Take it or leave it." [...] In a negative review, Slate magazine's David Edelstein called it [...] "a two-hour-and-six-minute snuff movie", while Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News felt it was [...] "the most virulently anti-Semitic movie made since the German propaganda films of World War II". Writing for the Dallas Observer, Robert Wilonsky said he found the movie [...] "too turgid to awe the nonbelievers, too zealous to inspire and often too silly to take seriously, with its demonic hallucinations that look like escapees from a David Lynch film; I swear I couldn't find the devil carrying around a hairy-backed midget anywhere in the text I read." ...|$|E
60|$|The temptation took a form {{which now}} tried <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time.|$|E
5000|$|... "Nun hast du mir den ersten Schmerz getan" [...] ("Now You Have Caused <b>Me</b> Pain <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> Time") ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Drunk," [...] I said aloud, whereon the servant, who {{understood}} <b>me,</b> spoke <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time, {{saying in a}} frightened voice in Dutch-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm keen on dancing," [...] said Mr. Pogis. [...] "I hope they'll {{give us a}} {{dance on}} board. Will you put <b>me</b> down <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> dance?" ...|$|R
60|$|I never enjoyed {{myself in}} my life as much as I did at that ball. Lady Desborough {{introduced}} {{a good many of}} the first comers to me, and Percy brought up more. He had engaged <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> waltz, and he presently asked <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> polka after supper; and my card was soon quite full for the whole evening.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time, with some spice of coquetry in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|He {{spoke to}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time. He spoke slowly and formally, and his accent {{struck me as}} being a little foreign.|$|E
5000|$|Neil Friedman, who {{was then}} {{president}} of Tyco Preschool, recalled years later that, [...] "When you played with <b>Me</b> Elmo <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time, it brought a smile to everyone's face. It was a magical surprise." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ormond saw her, {{and he had}} {{probably}} forgotten <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> {{there was a great}} longing in his voice as he said huskily: [...] "Will you kiss <b>me,</b> Grace, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> and last time since we were innocent children?" ...|$|R
60|$|The sub-mother {{looked out}} of the window, which opened upon {{little more than the}} once husband-sheltering apple-tree, and then, after a general glance around the room, she looked at <b>me,</b> and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time {{addressed}} <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{turned toward}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time. I saw a last {{vanishing}} trace of doubt {{in his eyes}} as they looked into mine.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{end of the}} year!" [...] I cried, {{the predicament}} {{striking}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time in its fulness. [...] "Say, you've got a crust!" ...|$|E
60|$|The reading completed, Mr. Bruff {{addressed}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{time since}} we had been shut up together in the seclusion of his own room.|$|E
60|$|This {{recognition}} of my authority was irresistible. Cristel had laid me under {{an obligation to}} her good influence for which I felt sincerely grateful--she had made <b>me</b> laugh, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time since my return to England.|$|R
60|$|When at last {{we reached}} the house and stood inside the hall, he turned to <b>me</b> and spoke <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time.|$|R
50|$|Reach <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> 4K {{end-to-end}} {{production and}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> feature film {{shot on the}} Dalsa Origin camera.|$|R
60|$|I started, in ungovernable agitation, to my feet. The lawyer's {{question}} reminded <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{time since}} I had left England, that something HAD happened.|$|E
6000|$|... "'You're quite right,' says she, 'that's {{just what}} happened. And then he kissed <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> and last time, and now he's {{on his way}} to America.' ...|$|E
60|$|It struck <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{time that}} {{possibly}} many other of my friend's arguments might be only blank cartridges, {{and used to}} frighten off other trespassing intellects.|$|E
60|$|I {{followed}} her to the door. I asked leave to call on her father, and satisfy him about myself and my family connections. She only answered that her father was too ill to see visitors. I went out with her on to the landing. She turned on <b>me</b> sharply <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time.|$|R
60|$|She {{acknowledged}} {{her identity}} with a nod. It was Wolf Larsen’s {{turn to be}} puzzled. The name and its magic signified nothing to him. I was proud that it did mean something to <b>me,</b> and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time in a weary while I was convincingly conscious of a superiority over him.|$|R
3000|$|<b>For</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{incentive}} {{was they}} offered us 10  lb… so I got the 10  lb {{and then started}} betting real money [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can tell}} you very little. It began with Mrs. Hudson being unjust to <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time in her life. And now I am already better!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"Bob {{never paid}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> draft. I lay he'll never pay {{me for the}} second. 'Twill cost the King nothing if I re-draw it," [...] I says.|$|E
60|$|I {{hesitated for}} a moment. It {{was clear that the}} man {{wanted to get rid of}} <b>me.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time, the idea of {{remaining}} in the hotel occurred to me.|$|E
60|$|Pietro and {{his nephew}} looked at <b>me.</b> They noticed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time that {{my face was}} new, and they glanced at one another with upraised brows.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was those}} {{words of his}} which set me talking bitterly. We had left Willesden, you understand, for all this took some time. My temper {{got the better of}} <b>me,</b> and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time in my life I let my brother see the rough side of me. Perhaps {{it would have been better}} had I done so earlier and more often.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is false, O people," [...] {{he cried}} {{in a voice}} that trembled with rage and fear. [...] "My {{daughter}} told <b>me</b> <b>the</b> tale <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time at dawn to-day." ...|$|R
60|$|We rose, {{left the}} hotel, and parted {{from each other}} in the street with a warm handshake, just as he began to {{interest}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time in our intercourse.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{we shall}} get on. When Philip {{came to our}} town here, and saw <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time--Do you object to my {{speaking}} familiarly of him, by his Christian name?" ...|$|E
60|$|There was a {{noticeable}} {{change in the}} lawyer's manner. It had lost its usual confidence and spirit. He shook hands with <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time in his life, in silence.|$|E
6000|$|I {{began to}} feel a little startled. [...] "How is it that you now tell <b>me</b> of this <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time?" [...] I said. [...] "Were you afraid of {{distressing}} me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, Toby," [...] {{said the}} old driver, as the boy came in sight. [...] "I was afraid you was goin' to keep <b>me</b> waitin' <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time. Jump right up on <b>the</b> box, <b>for</b> there hain't no time to lose, an' I guess you'll have to carry the monkey in your arms, for I don't want to stop to open the cage now." ...|$|R
