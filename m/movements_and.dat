40|$|Organelle <b>movement</b> <b>and</b> {{positioning}} {{are essential}} for proper cellular function. A nucleus moves dynamically during cell division and differentiation {{and in response to}} environmental changes in animal, fungal, and plant cells. Nuclear <b>movement</b> is well-studied <b>and</b> the mechanisms have been mostly elucidated in animal and fungal cells, but not in plant cells. In prothallial cells of the fern Adiantum capillus-veneris and leaf cells of the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana, light induces nuclear <b>movement</b> <b>and</b> nuclei change their position according to wavelength, intensity, and direction of light. This nuclear photorelocation movement shows some common features with the photorelocation movement of chloroplasts, {{which is one of the}} best-characterized plant organelle movements.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fluctuations in body <b>movement</b> <b>and</b> visual {{inspection}} were measured over minutes in 3 -month-old infants {{to look for}} evidence of coupling. In Experiment 1, infants (n 12) looked ad libitum at two identical pictures {{for an average of}} 7. 3 min. Analysis of the spontaneous fluctuations in <b>movement</b> <b>and</b> inspection revealed that they were inversely coupled: Moment-to-moment changes in <b>movement</b> <b>and</b> inspection occurred in opposite directions. In Experiment 2, after 4 min of free looking, infants (n 33) were presented with a new pair of stimuli, a temporary change in the stimuli, or no change in stimuli. The inverse coupling between the fluctuations in body <b>movement</b> <b>and</b> {{visual inspection}} found in Experiment 1 was present before and after the stimulus changes, even in infants whose body movement decreased transiently in response to the stimulus changes. The reappearance of inversely coupled fluctuations in body <b>movement</b> <b>and</b> visual inspection following the stimulus changes was led by increases in movement. The results demonstrate the stability of the inverse coupling between spontaneous fluctuations in body <b>movement</b> <b>and</b> visual inspection, and suggest tha...|$|R
