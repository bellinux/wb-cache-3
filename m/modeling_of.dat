5|$|Between 1973 and 1978, {{together}} with Dutch researcher Stan Tempelaars (1938–2010), Kaegi developed the VOSIM program. VOSIM, {{which stands for}} VOice SIMulator, is a system based on the digital sound synthesis of simple, sinusoidal square waves, allowing the <b>modeling</b> <b>of</b> vowel sounds, vocal fricatives and quasi-instrumental tones. It complemented, and was used in conjunction with, Gottfried Michael Koenig's own computer-generated music programs Project 1 (1964), Project 2 (1966) and SSP (1971). Werner Kaegi summed up the VOSIM system in 1986 in a presentation for the scientific journal Interface.|$|E
