5|$|Several {{variations}} of the Maunsell green, Urie sage green and Bulleid <b>malachite</b> <b>green</b> liveries were tried with black, white/black, and yellow lining, some sporting a green panel on the smoke deflectors. However, from 1942 to 1946, during the Second World War, {{members of the class}} under overhaul were turned out in unlined-black livery as a wartime economy measure, with green-shaded sunshine yellow lettering. The final Southern livery used from 1946 reverted to <b>malachite</b> <b>green,</b> with yellow/black lining, and sunshine yellow lettering. Some of the class (Nos.782 and 800, Sir Brian and Sir Persant) did not receive this livery.|$|E

25|$|Methylene blue {{is used in}} {{aquaculture}} and by tropical fish hobbyists as {{a treatment}} for fungal infections. It can also be effective in treating fish infected with ich although a combination of <b>malachite</b> <b>green</b> and formaldehyde is far more effective against the parasitic protozoa Ichthyophthirius multifiliis. It is usually used to protect newly laid fish eggs from being infected by fungus or bacteria. This is useful when the hobbyist wants to artificially hatch the fish eggs.|$|E
25|$|Colour is {{the most}} obvious {{property}} of a mineral, but it is often non-diagnostic. It is caused by electromagnetic radiation interacting with electrons (except {{in the case of}} incandescence, which does not apply to minerals). Two broad classes of elements (idiochromatic and allochromatic) are defined with regards to their contribution to a mineral's colour: Idiochromatic elements are essential to a mineral's composition; their contribution to a mineral's colour is diagnostic. Examples of such minerals are <b>malachite</b> (<b>green)</b> and azurite (blue). In contrast, allochromatic elements in minerals are present in trace amounts as impurities. An example of such a mineral would be the ruby and sapphire varieties of the mineral corundum.|$|E

5|$|Its {{main body}} is solid {{sterling}} silver and silver gilt, while its plinth {{is made of}} malachite, a semi-precious stone. The plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which {{the names of the}} title-winning clubs are listed. <b>Malachite's</b> <b>green</b> colour is also representative of the green field of play. The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football. Two of the lions are found above the handles {{on either side of the}} trophy – the third is symbolised by the captain of the title-winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, above his head at the end of the season. The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year.|$|R
30|$|The paintouts were {{prepared}} by brush coating natural parchment with different pigment/binder mixtures. Each pigment was bound with four different paint binders, chosen to simulate mediaeval and Renaissance illuminations: gum Arabic (GA), egg yolk (EY), egg white (albumen, EW) and whole egg (WE) were chosen. The pigments were also chosen to span the colour range of those {{most widely used}} in illuminations and included blue (azurite, ultramarine, indigo and smalt), yellow (lead–tin yellow I), red (vermilion, red lead, madder lake, lac lake), white (gypsum, chalk, lead white) and <b>green</b> (<b>malachite,</b> verdigris, <b>green</b> earth) ones. The paintouts’ thickness was not directly measured, but based on similar lab-made samples, the paint layers {{are estimated to be}} between 10 and 200 microns thick.|$|R
25|$|At the {{formation}} of British Railways on 1 January 1948, early diesel and electric locos and the gas turbine locomotives 18000 and 18100 were already painted black with aluminium trim, but by the late 1950s this had been superseded by the same shade of green that was used on express passenger steam locomotives, although some locomotives were painted in a two-tone Brunswick and Sherwood green livery, and Southern Region electric locomotives were painted a light shade of <b>malachite</b> <b>green.</b> Multiple units were also generally green, although this tended to be a lighter and bluer shade compared to the colour used on steam and diesel locomotives.|$|E
25|$|From 1956 {{there was}} a move toward the return of {{regional}} colour schemes. Most regions adopted a maroon livery which strongly resembled that of the former London Midland and Scottish Railway but the Western Region returned some of its coaches that were used on named express trains to a chocolate/cream scheme {{similar to that used}} by the GWR before nationalisation and from July 1956 the Southern Region began using a 'coaching stock' green that was somewhat darker than the <b>malachite</b> <b>green</b> colour of the old Southern Railway. For cost reasons, liveries were usually changed piecemeal, when coaches came in for scheduled maintenance. Coaches from different regions could also often find themselves coupled together. Due to the consequent muddle of liveries, many trains began to get an untidy if not tatty appearance which added to the run-down image of the railway. The rebranding of British Railways to British Rail on 1 January 1965 was coupled with the introduction of an entirely new national livery.|$|E
500|$|Livery was Southern Railway <b>malachite</b> <b>green</b> with [...] "sunshine yellow" [...] {{horizontal}} lining and lettering. [...] The {{first five}} locomotives {{were given a}} matt finish so as to obscure small irregularities in the casing. All class members that operated during the Second World War were eventually repainted in Southern Railway wartime black livery, with green-shaded [...] "Sunshine" [...] lettering. However, this was reverted to <b>malachite</b> <b>green</b> livery upon the ending of hostilities.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was the {{identification}} of the pigments of the Philippe Dagobert monument (1222 - 1232) by spectrophotometry (Visible (VIS) region). Based on the bibliographic information about the pigments used in the Middle Ages, reference coloured samples were prepared in the laboratory. The study was based on the comparative analysis of VIS reflectance spectra, corresponding to laboratory measurements, with the in situ measurements. The obtained results allowed a primary identification of the pigments: the blue stimuli came from a mixture of azurite and <b>malachite,</b> the <b>green</b> from a mixture of equal concentrations of <b>malachite</b> and <b>green</b> earth, while the red and yellow were obtained from red and yellow ochre, respectively, presenting signs of ageing. Finally, it was concluded from these measurements that VIS reflectance spectroscopy could be considered an appropriate nondestructive method for the investigation and characterisation of the chromatic identity of monuments when no sampling is allowed.

50|$|Badarian grave {{goods were}} {{relatively}} simple and the deceased wrapped in reed matting or animal skins and placed with personal {{items such as}} shell or stone beads. <b>Green</b> <b>malachite</b> ore, perhaps for personal decoration, has also been detected on stone palettes.|$|R
500|$|After the war four Nine Elms {{locomotives}} (38, 242, 243 & [...] 244) {{were turned}} out in fully lined <b>malachite</b> <b>green</b> for Waterloo station pilot duties.|$|E
500|$|The Lord Nelson {{class was}} {{initially}} painted in Maunsell lined olive green, which later {{changed to a}} lighter shade in the mid-1930s. From 1938, some of the locomotives were painted in a semi-matt <b>Malachite</b> <b>Green</b> finish when Bulleid replaced Maunsell as CME of the Southern. During the war years, the locomotives were painted in wartime black livery, though retained the word [...] "Southern" [...] in yellow on the tender. After the war, the livery was reverted to the Southern Railway <b>Malachite</b> <b>Green</b> standard with [...] "Sunshine Yellow" [...] lining on the boiler rings.|$|E
500|$|Initial livery after {{nationalisation}} in 1948 was British Railways <b>malachite</b> <b>green</b> and [...] "Sunshine yellow" [...] lining and lettering, with British Railways on the tender. No. 34090 Sir Eustace Missenden, Southern Railway {{was given}} commemorative <b>malachite</b> <b>green</b> livery that included green-painted wheels with yellow rims {{and the early}} British Railways crest on the tender. The Bulleid numbering system was temporarily retained on the first seventy locomotives {{with the addition of}} an [...] "s" [...] prefix (e.g. s21C101). The classes were given several power classifications in their careers, beginning with 6MT (Mixed Traffic) in 1949. In December 1953 they were reclassified 7P 5FA, the [...] "A" [...] denoting brake power when used on unfitted (non-vacuum braked) goods trains. The rebuilt locomotives retained this classification until all received the classification of 7P6F between November 1957 and November 1961.|$|E
50|$|The {{piece is}} then {{fired in the}} kiln, with the {{temperature}} ranging from 600 to 800 °C. Once the figurine is fired, slip can be applied. The slip is sometimes itself fired at low temperature. In the beginning, the range of colours available was rather limited: red, yellow, black and blue. From the Hellenistic era on, orange, pink mauve, and green are added to that repertoire. The pigments are natural mineral dyes: ochre for yellow and red, coal for black, <b>malachite</b> for <b>green,</b> etc.|$|R
50|$|Kohl was {{originally}} used as protection against eye ailments. There {{was also a}} belief that darkening around the eyes would protect one from the harsh rays of the sun.Galena eye paint (later termed Kohl in Arabic from the Akkadian word for the cosmetic) was widely applied in Ancient Egypt. Upper eyelids were painted black and lower ones were colored green, as depicted in ancient texts that describe the use of both black galena and <b>green</b> <b>malachite.</b> Ancient graves from the pre-historic Tasian culture point to the early application of galena in Egypt, a custom stretching from the Badarian period through to the Coptic era. Although found locally, both black galena and <b>green</b> <b>malachite</b> were also imported from nearby regions in Western Asia, Coptos and the Land of Punt.|$|R
50|$|Over 6,000 years ago, ancient Egyptians {{produced}} glittering cosmetics {{from the}} iridescent shells of beetles {{as well as}} finely ground <b>green</b> <b>malachite</b> crystal. Researchers believe Mayan temples were sometimes painted with red, green, and grey glitter paint made from mica dust, based on infrared scans of the remnants of paint still found on the structures in present-day Guatemala.|$|R
500|$|With the {{appointment}} of Oliver Bulleid as Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Southern, livery policy was changed once again to <b>malachite</b> <b>green</b> for major passenger locomotives, with Sunshine Yellow lettering. This was lined with yellow and black with solid black edging. [...] However, this livery was not applied to the M7 class, which were black with sunshine lettering shaded green.|$|E
500|$|After {{nationalisation}} in 1948, the locomotives' initial livery was {{a slightly}} modified Southern <b>Malachite</b> <b>Green</b> livery, where [...] "British Railways" [...] replaced [...] "Southern" [...] in [...] "Sunshine Yellow" [...] lettering on the tender sides. From 1949, {{the class was}} turned out in British Railways mixed-traffic black livery with red and cream lining. [...] The British Railways crest {{was placed on the}} tender water tank sides. [...] Numbering was in the 32xxx series, as numbers 32327 to 32333.|$|E
500|$|The initial livery applied {{following}} the nationalisation of the railways in 1948 was modified Southern <b>malachite</b> <b>green</b> and sunshine yellow with [...] "British Railways" [...] on the tender, and the Southern numbering system was temporarily retained with an [...] "S" [...] prefix (such as S850) until superseded by the British Railways numbering system. The locomotives then carried British Railways Brunswick green livery with orange and black lining. By this stage the locomotives were renumbered under standard British Railways procedure, from 30850 to 30865.|$|E
25|$|Ancient Egyptians mined {{malachite}} at Maadi. At first, Egyptians {{used the}} bright <b>green</b> <b>malachite</b> stones for ornamentations and pottery. Later, between 2613 and 2494 BC, large building projects required expeditions abroad {{to the area}} of Wadi Maghareh in order to secure minerals and other resources not available in Egypt itself. Quarries for turquoise and copper were also found at Wadi Hammamat, Tura, Aswan and various other Nubian sites on the Sinai Peninsula and at Timna.|$|R

Concealed doors lead to a walk-in safe that once contained Mrs. Marcos' fabled jewels and to a staircase leading to the ground floor room that contained Mrs. Marcos' clothes and accessories, including ternos and the much publicized 3000 shoes (actually 1500 pairs). The Quezon bedroom was on this site.|$|R
5000|$|Schafer's 1978 {{monograph}} on langgan {{sought to}} identify the treasured blue-green gemstone, if it ever had a unique identity, and concluded the most plausible identification is <b>malachite,</b> a bright <b>green</b> mineral that was anciently used as a copper ore and an ornamental stone. Two early Chinese mineralogical authorities (Chang 1921: 24, Read and Pak 1928: 21) identified langgan as malachite, commonly called kǒngquèshí 孔雀石 (lit. [...] "peacock stone") or shílǜ 石綠 (lit. [...] "stone green").|$|R
500|$|Under Southern ownership, the [...] "Remembrances" [...] were {{originally}} painted in Maunsell's Olive Green livery as seen above, with [...] "Southern" [...] and the locomotive's {{number on the}} tender tank. [...] Wartime service under the Southern saw the locomotives painted in black livery with [...] "Sunshine Yellow" [...] lettering. [...] Numbers allocated to the locomotives were 2327 to 2333. [...] After the war, the locomotives were turned out in Bulleid's Southern Railway <b>Malachite</b> <b>Green</b> livery with [...] "Sunshine Yellow" [...] lettering.|$|E
500|$|British Railways {{gave the}} class the power {{classification}} of 5P after nationalisation in 1948. For the first 18months the locomotives sported a transitional livery: Southern Railway <b>malachite</b> <b>green</b> with [...] "British Railways" [...] on the tender in sunshine yellow lettering. As {{each member of}} the class became due for a heavy general overhaul, they were repainted in the new standard British Railways express passenger livery of Brunswick green with orange and black lining from April 1949. Initially, the British Railways [...] "Cycling Lion" [...] crest was located on the tender, replaced from the 1957 by the later [...] "Ferret and Dartboard" [...] crest.|$|E
500|$|When built, the Schools Class were outshopped in Maunsell's darker {{version of}} the LSWR {{passenger}} sage green livery lined in black and white, with cabside numberplates and [...] "Southern" [...] and the loco number on the tender in yellow. Later adaptations of the Southern Railway livery following Bulleid's arrival as Chief Mechanical Engineer entailed <b>Malachite</b> <b>Green</b> livery, again with [...] "Sunshine Yellow" [...] picking out the numbers and [...] "Southern" [...] on the tender (during the Second World War the locomotives were painted black with yellow lettering and numbers). The smoke deflectors– a later addition– were also treated with this livery. Numbers allocated to the locomotives were 900939.|$|E
50|$|The copper {{ore deposit}} found {{here is the}} grayish mineral {{chalcocite}} (copper sulfide) embedded in a hard gray sandstone band of the Bloomsburg Red Beds. The similar color and low ore yield make visual identification difficult. Secondary minerals {{that can be seen}} include <b>green</b> <b>malachite</b> and blue-green chrysocolla.Between 1903 and 1906, Dr. Keith reported an average yield of 3.25% copper using 100 samples.In 1943, the United States Geological Survey reported yields of 0.11% to 0.38% copper and recommended that no more work be done at Pahaquarry.|$|R
2500|$|The {{main body}} of copper ore formed between two {{geological}} faults in broken dolomite rocks. The ore body was up to 70metres(230ft) wide and mainly consisted of <b>green</b> <b>malachite</b> and blue azurite veins and nodules amongst the host rock. The malachite and azurite were formed from copper sulphide minerals, by {{a process known as}} [...] "secondary enrichment". This process took millions of years to convert the low grade copper sulphide ore, which was probably created 300 to 400 millions of years ago during the last period of vulcanism near Burra.|$|R
30|$|Copper-based green {{pigments}} {{were identified}} in samples, malachite and atacamite, are the principal green pigments widely found in ancient wall paintings [19 – 21]. They were used to depict trees, grasses, garments of the figure and the panel framings of the Chinese folding screens in the Five Northern Provinces’ Assembly Hall murals. The colours range from light green to dark <b>green.</b> <b>Malachite</b> was widely used in every mural, while atacamite-pigmented layers were thick and just for the decoration of the figures and horses in the main hall murals.|$|R
