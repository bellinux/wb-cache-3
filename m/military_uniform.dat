5|$|However, {{on certain}} collar days {{designated}} by the Sovereign, members attending formal events may wear the Order's collar over their <b>military</b> <b>uniform,</b> formal wear, or other costume.

5|$|As in Britain, some Southern Rhodesian women {{during the}} war {{presented}} men not wearing <b>military</b> <b>uniform</b> with white feathers (symbolising cowardice). This campaign often went awry, {{as many of the}} men presented with the feathers were not in fact shirking from service. In 1916, hoping to save them further harassment, the Rhodesia Herald and other newspapers began publishing lists of men who had volunteered only to be deemed medically unfit by the army doctors.|$|E

5|$|By {{the next}} morning, the loyalist forces had collapsed. Diệm {{and his younger}} brother and chief adviser, Ngô Đình Nhu, agreed to surrender, and coup plotter Đôn promised them safe passage out of the country. In the meantime, Minh left Joint General Staff (JGS) {{headquarters}} and travelled to Gia Long Palace in a sedan, accompanied by Nhung. He arrived at the palace at 08:00 in full <b>military</b> <b>uniform</b> to supervise the arrest of Diệm and Nhu for the surrender ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The collar is worn on {{designated}} collar days over <b>military</b> <b>uniform</b> or morning dress {{by members}} attending formal events. The collar is {{fastened to the}} shoulders with silk ribbons (or gold safety pins when worn with morning dress). Since the collar signifies the Order of the Garter, members can then wear the riband of any other order to which they belong. The collar is only worn at specific occasions that warrant it.|$|E
5|$|Formerly, men {{not wearing}} <b>military</b> <b>uniform</b> wore knee {{breeches}} of an 18th-century design. Women's evening dress included trains and tiaras or feathers {{in their hair}} (or both). The dress code governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed. After World WarI, when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts {{a few inches from}} the ground, she requested a lady-in-waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king's reaction. King GeorgeV was horrified, so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low. Following their accession in 1936, King GeorgeVI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. Today, there is no official dress code. Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits; a minority wear morning coats, and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, black tie or white tie.|$|E

5|$|Further {{examination}} of the blood of both Zero and the dead man reveal that their condition has been induced through gene therapy. Watts and Black theorize that the DOE is developing a biological weapon which would incite violence and rioting in a targeted population; they learn that the research is being conducted by scientists involved in the Human Genome Project. Later, the body of Knox is found at a nearby morgue. Later, Black and Watts, assisted by local police, raid an office building connected to the project, which they believe is using homeless shelters to test their pathogen. They hope to recover Zero in the raid, but find him cogent and working for the project—his real name is Dr. William Kramer, and he denies any knowledge of the incident. Black believes Kramer was accidentally infected during his work, and finds a photograph in the man's office, showing him in <b>military</b> <b>uniform,</b> {{taking part in the}} 1994 Rwandan Genocide.|$|E
5|$|The anthem is {{mandatory}} at the swearing-in of the President of Russia, for {{opening and closing}} sessions of the Duma and the Federation Council, and for official state ceremonies. It is played on television and radio {{at the beginning and}} end of the broadcast day. If programming is continuous, the anthem is played once at 0600 hours and again at midnight. The anthem is also played on New Year's Eve after the New Year Address by the President. It is played at sporting events in Russia and abroad, according to the protocol of the organisation hosting the games. According to the law, when the anthem is played officially, everybody must stand up (in case the national flag is raising, facing to the flag), men must remove their headgear (in practice, excluding those in <b>military</b> <b>uniform</b> and clergymen). Uniformed personnel must give a military salute when the anthem plays.|$|E
5|$|When Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, Riefenstahl {{was photographed}} in Poland wearing a <b>military</b> <b>uniform</b> and a pistol on her belt {{in the company}} of German soldiers; she had gone to Poland as a war correspondent. On 12 September, she was in the town of Końskie when 30 civilians were {{executed}} in retaliation for an alleged attack on German soldiers. According to her memoir, Riefenstahl tried to intervene but a furious German soldier held her at gunpoint and threatened to shoot her on the spot. She claimed she did not realize the victims were Jews. Closeup photographs of a distraught Riefenstahl survive from that day. Nevertheless, by 5 October 1939, Riefenstahl was back in occupied Poland filming Hitler's victory parade in Warsaw. Afterwards, she left Poland and chose not to make any more Nazi-related movies.|$|E

5|$|The torch {{lighting}} ceremony {{took place}} on 17 July 1948 in Olympia, Greece. As with the 1936 Summer Olympic relay, the torch relay was begun by focusing the sun's rays onto kindling using a parabolic reflector, which then lit the first torch. The kindling was conducted by a Girl Guide leader from Pyrgos, Elis. She was only chosen the previous evening due to the unsettled state of the country; the Athenian girl who was trained for the ceremony was unable to travel to Olympia. In a symbolic gesture, the first runner, Corporal Dimitrelis of the Greek Army, laid down his arms and removed his <b>military</b> <b>uniform</b> before taking his torch in hand. The kindling material for the first torch was handed over as {{a gift from the}} Chairman of the Greek Olympic Committee to Collins, for Princess Elizabeth. It was then run to the Greek coast at Katakolo, where at 7pm it boarded the Greek destroyer Hastings bound for the island of Corfu. It stayed overnight in the city of Corfu, and boarded HMS Whitesand Bay at 1:30pm the following day where the flame was switched to a specially equipped butane gas torch {{in order to ensure that}} there was a 48-hour lifespan available for the flame, despite the crossing only being expected to take 22 hours.|$|E

25|$|This dress {{has fallen}} into disuse since the 1980s. Initially {{this was due}} to Sir Paul Reeves, as a cleric, {{choosing}} not wearing a <b>military</b> <b>uniform.</b> Although not specifically colonial, the traditional dress was abandoned as overt reminders of a colonial legacy. Usually the Governor-General will now wear a black lounge jacket with morning dress trousers for men or formal day dress for ladies (or <b>military</b> <b>uniform</b> if they are already entitled to it) for ceremonial occasions and normal day dress at other times. The undress form of the uniform is still worn on rare occasions, such as when the Governor-General visits military bases.|$|E
