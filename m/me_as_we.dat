500|$|In 1995, a {{deal was}} signed between Ecclestone and the FIA that passed {{all of the}} {{commercial}} rights to Formula One to him for 15years, {{on the condition that}} they would return to the FIA {{at the end of that}} period. Ecclestone had been building up Formula One as a television package since the early 1990s, investing heavily in new digital television technology. For the duration of the deal, the FIA would receive an index-linked annual fixed royalty, estimated by Lovell at around 15%. Mosley said [...] "My belief is that I got a better deal than anyone else could have because it was more difficult for Ecclestone to take a hard line with <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> had worked together for so long." [...] The following year the FIA also passed the rights to all its other directly sanctioned championships and events to Ecclestone, also for 15years, An attempt to add a 10-year extension to the F1 contract in return for a share in Ecclestone's proposed flotation of Formula One was later vetoed by the European Commission. Mosley's agreement with Ecclestone on TV rights for F1 angered three of the team principals in particular: Ron Dennis (McLaren), Frank Williams (Williams) and Ken Tyrrell (Tyrrell), who felt that neither Ecclestone nor the FIA had the right to make such an agreement without the teams. They refused to sign the 1997 Concorde Agreement without increased financial returns and threatened to make a complaint under European Union competition rules. The European Commission was already investigating the FIAâ€™s agreement with Ecclestone in what Lovell calls a [...] "highly personal and bitter battle between Max Mosley and [...] van Miert".|$|E
2500|$|Rashid {{found out}} {{that he was going to}} become a daddy in about 8 months. Stunned and confused, Rashid had life {{altering}} decisions to make with his girlfriend, Kim Jones. The situation led to the composition of his favourite cut on One Day... that offers a male slant on abortion. [...] "Retrospect for Life", produced by James Poyser and No I.D. featuring Lauryn Hill (who was due on the same day as Rashid's girlfriend), is the song that is the driving force behind the project. Rashid listens to [...] "Retrospect for Life" [...] today at the mastering session geeked, as if it were for the first time. He tells <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> listen to L-Boogie wail the chorus, [...] "when I listen to the song now, I think about how precious her (Omoye's) life is".|$|E
2500|$|It was {{reported}} on January 23 the sale agreement had been completed. Early reports indicated Hicks would remain a minority owner {{with the club}} and would serve on the board in a non-voting honorary position. Approval from the executive and ownership committee, the banks who were owed money by HSG, and 75% of MLB owners was still required before the sale could have been finalized. The new company would be called Rangers Baseball Express. Greenberg would serve as CEO and managing partner, and Ray Davis and Bob Simpson would be co-chairmen of the board. As {{a part of the}} original purchase agreement, Rangers Baseball Express also would acquire approximately [...] of land adjacent to Rangers Ballpark in Arlington and Cowboys Stadium. A separate company owned by Hicks owns the land. After the land sale was announced, Hicks was sued by a former partner over the land. The former partner claims Hicks never dissolved the partnership that was formed when the two groups were planning the development called Glorypark. Hicks was also sued by an architectural firm, RTKL, and a construction company, Vratsinas, for $6.9 million of unpaid work done over three years ago. Greenberg posted the following on his Facebook page after the original purchase agreement was announced:Tonight was a big night for Nolan Ryan and <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> signed the definitive agreement to purchase the Texas Rangers. Thank you to everyone for your incredible support and encouragement over the last few months. Nolan and I can't wait to get started in our efforts to bring Rangers fans everywhere what you have waited for ...all these years. Thanks again and.... See you at the Ballpark!....... Chuck ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'That's lucky. Awful {{thing to}} live down--a photograph, isn't it?' said Stalky to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> reached the landing. 'I'm {{thinking}} of the newspapers, of course.' ...|$|E
60|$|We presented, indeed, {{a strange}} spectacle, for the mage, in his silvery swathings, held Leonora by the hands, and Leonora held <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> raced through the gloom.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! love me, my Stephen, love me, dear. Love <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if <b>we</b> {{were never}} to love again. Am I {{beautiful}}, my dear? Am I {{beautiful in the}} moonlight? Tell me!...|$|R

60|$|The {{lieutenant}} {{would not}} mind; {{he made a}} hasty toilet and joined <b>me.</b> <b>As</b> <b>we</b> were going along a passage toward the Presence we encountered a formidable obstacle--the general.|$|E
60|$|During perhaps {{half an hour}} we two went {{steadily}} but cautiously forward, {{and then}} it seemed to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if <b>we</b> should have arrived at the spot from which the shots had come.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed very}} much to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if <b>we</b> had lost the Avenger, {{whichever}} way we turned, and my heart grew heavy, for once she was gone Jerry and I were badly off.|$|R
