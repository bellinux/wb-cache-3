5000|$|Blend time, {{sometimes}} termed mixing time, is {{the time}} to achieve a predefined level of homogeneity of a tracer in a mixing vessel. Blend time is an important parameter to evaluate the <b>mixing</b> <b>efficiency</b> of mixing devices. [...] In order to make this definition valid, the tracer should be in the same physical phase (e.g. liquid) as the bulk material. [...] Blend time can be determined either with experiments or numerical modeling, such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The experimental methods to determine the blend time in liquid include conductivity method and discoloration method. The conductivity method requires a conductivity probe to present in the target system, which make it an intrusive method because the existence of the probe might change the <b>mixing</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the mixing device. Discoloration method does not require any probe which makes it a non-intrusive method.

His research on stably stratified turbulence has illuminated the mixing mechanisms at density interfaces, and the unifying concept of <b>mixing</b> <b>efficiency</b> which he introduced is now widely used to characterise stratified turbulence.

He has pioneered the current approach to modelling natural ventilation flows in complex buildings.
