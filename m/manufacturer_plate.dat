50|$|BVB had {{the need}} to order new trains because of the {{extension}} of Line E from Tierpark to the Hellersdorf area and Hönow. BVB had contracted several trains from the Berlin S-Bahn and those selected D57/D60 units from the BVG which was originally destined to be scrapped. The first two prototypes started delivery in May 1986 before the subsequent delivery in September 1986. The condition was later reversed. For safety reasons, the ceilings of the <b>manufacturer</b> <b>plate</b> was given after the trains were burnt out at Klosterstraße station. 25 double-end cars were also added into the fleet for the D class trains, whereas the remainder of 41 were Line E. The last of these trains were delivered before September 1990, just before Die Wende.|$|E
30|$|For all experiments, {{we used a}} PSC {{manufactured}} oven system, {{which is}} a 15  kW dielectric heating capacity research designed unit (Model No: PP 15 L, Serial No: 894 built by PSC for USDA, APHIS, Worchester, MA). It is an oscillator-based oven that delivers continuous RF power output with an operational frequency of 19.0  MHz. Electrode spacing can be independently adjusted from 10.2 to 25.6  cm from the load being treated. Plate height was adjusted to achieve optimum operating conditions as recommended by the <b>manufacturer.</b> <b>Plate</b> voltage (KV) was 10.5  KVDC and grid current was 0.35  amp. Plate current reaches 2.5  amp when the oven is fully loaded. Prior to experimentation the RF oven was calibrated for optimum heating consistency.|$|E

50|$|Note: The Oxford {{is known}} {{by many as}} a Wolseley model, as it was {{designed}} and first built at the Wolseley factory at Ward End. The manufacturer's name as recognised by the DVLA, and shown on some Road Fund Licence ('tax') discs and V5 registration documents is Nuffield.

5000|$|An {{alternative}} {{heavier duty}} version which appeared almost identical, was sold by Renault Trucks as the Renault B70 to B120. It first appeared as the [...] B70 (diesel) {{and as the}} [...] B80 (petrol) in late 1982. It was a light truck with a Renault Master I body on a separate chassis, rear wheel-drive and rear dual wheels. The B-series was offered {{with a range of}} alternative body options. As the Master (and the smaller Trafic) both carried <b>manufacturer's</b> <b>plates</b> from Renault's automobile division, RVI's production numbers appeared to plummet as the SG2 and SG3 were gradually replaced. It was thus decided in 1982 to transfer the new, heavier B-series range to RVI. More powerful versions were gradually added, incorporating turbochargers and intercooling.|$|R

This included receiving pack mountain 75mm guns for its artillery regiment that {{were of the}} 1905 model with their <b>manufacturer's</b> <b>plate</b> stating they were manufactured in St. Petersburg. In 1958, following post-Stalinist reforms, the division was reduced to the 451st Mountain Rifle Regiment, {{but in the next}} year it was reformed albeit as the 124th Motor Rifle Division (cadre, about fifteen per cent strong), including the 401st Tank Regiment. It reverted to the 201st Gatchina Motor Rifle Division in 1965. By this time the division's artillery regiment became the 998th Self Propelled Artillery Regiment Starokonstantinovsky. In 1960s the division also received the 1098th Anti-Aircraft Missile Regiment.|$|R
50|$|There is a Wolseley brand two-stand {{portable}} shearing {{plant in}} the collection of the National Museum of Australia in Canberra. Manufactured in Birmingham, England, around 1930, the shearing plant is powered by a 32-volt, three horse-power single-cylinder petrol engine, mounted on a wooden trolley base with four cast iron wheels. The plant incorporated a revolutionary mechanised shearing handpiece, one of which is also in the museum's collection. The engine is painted green and inscribed with the brand name Wolseley, and has a metal <b>manufacturer's</b> <b>plate</b> which reads: Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company Ltd Birmingham England. The plant, weighing 550 kg, was used on a sheep property named 'Emoh Ruo' in the Rockley-Black Springs area of New South Wales. It was used by Roy and George Keogh between 1948 and 1976.|$|R

5000|$|One of the weapon's {{most notable}} {{features}} {{was in its}} exceptionally high rate of fire of about 1,200 rounds per minute, {{twice the rate of}} the Vickers and Browning machine guns, which fired {{at a rate of about}} 600 rounds per minute. The ear could not easily discern the sound of individual shots being fired, instead hearing a sound described as like [...] "ripping cloth" [...] or a buzzsaw, giving rise to the nickname [...] "Hitler's buzzsaw" [...] (and the German soldiers' Hitlersäge ("Hitler's saw" [...] or [...] "buzzsaw"). This gun [...] (like the MG 34) was sometimes called [...] "Spandau" [...] by British troops, a traditional generic term for all German machine guns, left over from the famous Allied nickname for the MG 08 Maxim-derivative used by German forces during World War I and derived from its <b>manufacturer's</b> <b>plates</b> noting the city where some were produced.|$|R
