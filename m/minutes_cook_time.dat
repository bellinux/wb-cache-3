5|$|According to setup {{coordinator}} Douglas Cook, the rehearsals {{enabled them}} to reduce the setup time to under five <b>minutes.</b> <b>Cook,</b> who had worked on previous halftime shows, understood the details and guided the team. Drawings of the performances depicted what was expected for each setup, with the volunteers assembling the stage in segments and moving them to the field with carts. Madonna's entrance had to be rehearsed several times for coordination. Although Cook learned during the game that the New England Patriots were scheduled to exit on the route used by volunteers carrying the stage equipment, he resolved the issue by talking with the team.|$|R

60|$|Beside all this, in Tamai dwelt {{the most}} {{beautiful}} and unsophisticated women in the entire Society group. In short, the village was so remote from the coast, and had been so much less affected by recent changes than other places that, in most things, Tahitian life was here seen as formerly existing {{in the days of}} young Otoo, the boy-king, in <b>Cook's</b> <b>time.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many {{of the new}} fryer models include {{electronic}} temperature controls. These computerized controls save energy by constantly sensing and adjusting {{the temperature of the}} oil.

25|$|By {{the second}} week of August 1778 Cook was through the Bering Strait, sailing into the Chukchi Sea. He headed {{north-east}} up the coast of Alaska until he was blocked by sea ice. His furthest north was 70 degrees 44 <b>minutes.</b> <b>Cook</b> then sailed west to the Siberian coast, and then south-east down the Siberian coast back to the Bering Strait. By early September 1778 he was back in the Bering Sea to begin the trip to the Sandwich (Hawaiian) Islands. He became increasingly frustrated on this voyage, and perhaps began to suffer from a stomach ailment; it has been speculated that this led to irrational behaviour towards his crew, such as forcing them to eat walrus meat, which they had pronounced inedible.|$|R

All intelligent people praise Kamehameha I. and Liholiho for conferring upon their people the great boon of civilization. I would do it myself, but my intelligence is out of repair, now, from over-work.|$|R
5000|$|On June 20, 2013 Byron Cook {{served as}} {{chairman}} of the House State Affairs Committee hearing on Texas State House Bill 60. Cook's stance was for the passing of the bill and during the hearing he interrupted a testimony, saying [...] "Some of us do (adopt children)." [...] At 12:00 AM on June 21, Cook decided to close the hearing prematurely. Cook's explanation for breaching Texas State Legislature operating procedures was that the testimonies being heard had become repetitive. Twenty-four <b>minutes</b> later, <b>Cook</b> became personally offended by a testimony, ordering the cameras to be shut off and leaving the room of committee members and witnesses. Approximately 20 <b>minutes</b> afterwards, <b>Cook</b> was persuaded by colleagues to resume the hearing and continued listening to testimonies until he prematurely closed the hearing at 1:30 AM.|$|R

50|$|The species {{survival}} is not threatened at all, {{as it is}} grown commercially for potted plants. However, the native, natural stands of A. heterophylla were always restricted and have been much reduced since Capt. <b>Cook's</b> <b>time.</b> Farming, poor land management {{and the introduction of}} invasive species have reduced its population on the original three islands considerably. The main remaining stands are now within Norfolk Island National park and are therefore under some control.|$|R
50|$|Blaze Pizza’s {{name was}} derived from how quickly a create-your-own pizza can be “Fast Fire’d” in a {{high-temperature}} open-flame oven - an average <b>cook</b> <b>time</b> is 3 <b>minutes.</b> Customers begin by choosing which of the ingredients they’d like on their pizza pie. As customers work {{their way down the}} service line, staff assemble a pizza based on customer instructions. When they arrive {{at the end of the}} line, their custom-built pizza is ready to be cooked.|$|R

The players {{initially}} appeared confused, then began shaking hands. The ground announcer advised that a replay would be required.|$|R
