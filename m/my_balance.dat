[...] "There was actually a she {{used to work at}} a bank that I banked at when I was, like, 20 years old. When I moved to Los Angeles, I had to call her once, about <b>my</b> <b>balance.</b> She said, 'Hel-lo, Miss Ullman! How's Hollywood? 'I said, 'Have you ever been here, Kay?' She said, 'Oh, no!

2500|$|It was {{revealed}} afterwards that Suárez had written {{as part of}} his defence that [...] "I lost <b>my</b> <b>balance,</b> making my body unstable and falling on top of my opponent. At that moment, I hit my face against the player, leaving a small bruise on my cheek and a strong pain in my teeth". Chiellini said he hoped FIFA would reduce the suspension that had been imposed. Uruguay captain Diego Lugano claimed the ban was [...] "barbarity" [...] and [...] "a breach of human rights", while the AUF described it as [...] "excessive" [...] and [...] "severe", and claimed that it [...] "feels like Uruguay has been thrown out of the World Cup". Suárez showed contrition after the ban was given, saying [...] "I deeply regret what occurred", and vowed to never bite anybody again.|$|E
2500|$|... nerves are {{stretched}} like a wire; the simplest outing becomes a huge challenge – I {{have to have}} Angela's arm to support me most days... <b>my</b> <b>balance</b> {{or lack of it}} is probably my biggest problem. My blessings are my memories and we have a few very loyal friends who help us through the bad days... Financially all's well. Thank goodness my wife, who holds nothing of the past over my head, is constantly at my side. Real love never dies. We share a sense of humour which at times is vital. If I have a philosophy it is that life doesn't put everything your way. It takes a little back. I strive to remember the ups rather than the downs. I {{have a lot of time}} with my thoughts these days and sometimes they hurt so much I can hardly bear it. However, my friends always associate me with the song: [...] "When You're Smiling..."

60|$|Well, so I did. I used to {{be bothered}} about <b>my</b> <b>balances,</b> but I {{reasoned}} it out this way: We all have queerish balances, and the natives all know it, and water their copra in a proportion so that it's fair all round; but the truth is, it did use to bother me, and, though I did well in Falesá, I was half glad when the firm moved me on to another station, where I was under no kind of a pledge and could look <b>my</b> <b>balances</b> in the face.|$|R

5000|$|I {{work on a}} {{preliminary}} design of the material, but not just at an harmonic level. On {{the base of the}} dodecaphonic series I first construct a linear design, which usually has consequences in the verticality of the music, since <b>my</b> <b>balanced</b> chords are usually intimately bounded with the linear design. Sometimes two balanced chords generate the dodecaphonic range which I use as a sonorous background from where I extract the thematic material. I believe that maybe, in my preconscious, though in an unclear way, theres always an explorative eagerness." ...|$|R

40|$|The Speaker of the House has {{tremendous}} procedural {{authority over the}} legislative schedule. He is able to define which bills will be considered and when they will be considered. This gives him an effective veto over the schedule and allows him to define the legislative agenda. The concentration of agenda control {{in the hands of}} the Speaker and the increased partisanship in the House has led scholars to argue that the Speaker uses his scheduling authority to create a legislative agenda that is biased towards the majority party’s interests. In this dissertation, I challenge this portrait of the Speaker. I argue that the Speaker is an agent of the chamber and the majority party and to satisfy these competing principals, he must balance the chamber’s institutional demand for fairness and the majority party’s demand for partisan benefits. The partisan theory of scheduling and <b>my</b> <b>balancing</b> theory lead to different expectations about scheduling, which are the basis for the empirical analysis. First, partisan theories argue that the Speaker will frequently change the regular order of business to optimize a bill’s partisan benefits. I expect, however, that the Speaker wil...|$|R

60|$|I {{found myself}} that the cries were {{singularly}} irritating, and they grew in depth and intensity {{as the afternoon}} wore on.
