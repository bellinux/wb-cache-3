2500|$|The marble gravestone of a Saracen {{girl named}} Majmuna (pr. My-moona), {{found in a}} pagan temple in the Xewkija area of Gozo dates back to 1173. Written in Kufic, it concludes saying, [...] "You who read this, see that dust covers <b>my</b> <b>eyelids,</b> in my place and in my house, nothing but sadness and weeping; what will my resurrection be like?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The white man’s lodges for the Great Spirit, whose pinnacles {{reach the}} sky, and which have stood for more seasons than the red man reckon, all struck me with terrible wonder. And the Great Spirit speaks to me {{sometimes}} since I have been here. [...] When I {{was in the}} Great Spirit Lodge (Westminster Abbey) where the kings are buried, I laid my face upon my hands. [...] The words of the preacher I did not know, but they sounded like the softy winds through a leafy forest and <b>my</b> <b>eyelids</b> were heavy. [...] Then I heard soft music and sweet voices, and a great cloud came down towards me, and when it nearly touched me, it opened and I saw {{in a blaze of}} light the girls with wings and they beckoned me. [...] And I was so certain that what I saw was that, I called out to my young men who were with me ‘Come and see what this is,’ and the young men replied, “You have been dreaming.’ But what I saw was true, for when I looked around the great lodge afterwards, I saw on the walls the same girls with wings as I saw in my dreams. [...] Our people will wonder at these things, when we return to the Native Reservation and tell them what we have seen.” ...|$|E
60|$|Regarding him I had {{no further}} anxiety, and, without being aware that slumber was {{weighing}} heavily upon <b>my</b> <b>eyelids,</b> I fell asleep.|$|E
5000|$|The {{words that}} she uttered went {{straight}} through my heartI sobbed and I sighed, and I straight did departWith a tear on <b>my</b> <b>eyelid</b> {{as big as}} a beanI bid farewell to Polly and to Paddington Green ...|$|R
6000|$|Hill, vale, tree, flower--they stand distinct, [...] Nature to {{know and}} name. What then? [...] A Voice spoke thence which {{straight}} unlinked [...] Fancy from fact; see, all's in ken: [...] Has once <b>my</b> <b>eyelid</b> winked? [...] 40 ...|$|R
5|$|I {{set to work}} to slap him as hard as I could. After a moment, <b>my</b> father's <b>eyelids</b> moved {{slightly}} over his glazed eyes. He was breathing weakly.|$|R
60|$|With {{his thumb}} {{he turned up}} one of <b>my</b> <b>eyelids,</b> whereat I opened my other eye and gazed up at the group bending over me.|$|E
6000|$|Withdraw my {{curtains}} {{from the}} night, [...] And let the crispèd crescent shine Upon <b>my</b> <b>eyelids</b> while I sleep, [...] And soothe {{me with her}} beams benign.|$|E
6000|$|Gallop, Ruello, oh, faster yet! [...] Good God, that flash! O God! I am chill,-- [...] Something {{hangs on}} <b>my</b> <b>eyelids</b> heavy as death,-- [...] Gallop, gallop, gallop, Ruel! ...|$|E
60|$|September 19th.--Lying by {{the lake}} {{yesterday}} afternoon, with my eyes shut, while the waves and sunshine were playing together on the water, the quick glimmer of the wavelets was perceptible through <b>my</b> closed <b>eyelids.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> drowsy <b>eyelids</b> {{fell back}} again. When I awoke {{a long time}} seemed to have passed. The air was clearer, the sky darker, and the sun had gone behind the peaks. I saw Bill and Herky {{skinning}} a deer.|$|R
6000|$|Now we are {{come to our}} Kingdom, But <b>my</b> love's <b>eyelids</b> fall. All that I wrought for, {{all that}} I fought for, Delight her nothing at all. My crown is of {{withered}} leaves, For she sits in the dust and grieves. Now we are come to our Kingdom! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was but one gloomy {{subject from}} morning till night; {{in the daytime}} I was uneasy, in the night I had little rest; I {{sometimes}} never closed <b>my</b> <b>eyelids</b> for grief." ...|$|E
6000|$|I read, before <b>my</b> <b>eyelids</b> dropt their shade, [...] "The Legend of Good Women," [...] {{long ago}} [...] Sung by the morning star [1] of song, who made [...] His music heard below; ...|$|E
6000|$|But, {{when our}} cheeks with anguish glow'd, [...] When thy sweet lips were join'd to mine; [...] The tears that from <b>my</b> <b>eyelids</b> flow'd [...] Were lost in those which fell from thine.|$|E
6000|$|... "The pain had passed. I thought I {{was killing}} myself and I did not care. I shall {{never forget that}} dawn, and the strange horror of seeing that my hands had become as clouded glass, and {{watching}} them grow clearer and thinner as the day went by, until at last I could see the sickly disorder of my room through them, though I closed <b>my</b> transparent <b>eyelids.</b> <b>My</b> limbs became glassy, the bones and arteries faded, vanished, and the little white nerves went last. I gritted my teeth and stayed there to the end. At last only the dead tips of the fingernails remained, pallid and white, and the brown stain of some acid upon my fingers.|$|R
6000|$|... "O <b>my</b> left <b>eyelid</b> flutters," [...] exclaimed the Baital in despair, [...] "my heart throbs, {{my sight}} is dim: surely now beginneth the end. It is as Vidhata hath written on my forehead--how {{can it be}} otherwise[FN#166]? Still listen, O mighty Raja, whilst I recount to you a true story, and Saraswati[FN#167] sit on my tongue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 3. Oh lift me {{from the}} grass! I die! I faint! I fail! Let thy love in kisses rain On <b>my</b> lips and <b>eyelids</b> pale. [...] 20 My cheek is cold and white, alas! My heart beats loud and fast;-- Oh! press it to thine own again, Where it will break at last.|$|R
6000|$|I cannot raise <b>my</b> <b>eyelids</b> up from sleep, [...] But I am {{visited with}} {{thoughts}} of you; [...] Slumber has no refreshment half so deep [...] As the sweet morn, that wakes my heart anew.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let him do so," [...] {{the earl}} said, [...] "and a {{commission}} in horse, foot, or artillery {{is at his}} service. And now, with your permission, I will to bed, for <b>my</b> <b>eyelids</b> are consumedly heavy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then Bell {{handed me}} the wheel, an' went below to warm himself. When he came up my gloves were frozen to the spokes an' the ice clicked over <b>my</b> <b>eyelids.</b> Pairfect North Atlantic winter weather, as I was sayin'.|$|E

5000|$|Young {{revealed}} {{the origin of}} the album's title when he said: I'm from the middle of nowhere in Minnesota you see, so the ocean has always been a curiously dreamy, ethereal, almost romantic thing to me. Over the years I {{spent a great deal of}} time with my eyes closed, imagining myself having the most wonderful adventures by the seaside. Doing things one can only do in dusk and glow and midsummer dreams, as if the back of <b>my</b> closed <b>eyelids</b> were a silver screen and I was a sentimental projectionist with hundreds of fanciful reels at hand, all ready to roll. Thus is the reasoning behind the title. Adam Young ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very like. An {{accident}} that often happened. I {{should like to}} have a crown for every time he has cut my head open. He cut it open once with a key and twice with a lock; he knocked the corner of a lock into my head twice, once with a bolt and once with a shut; you know what that is; the thing what runs into the staple. He hit me on the head with a hammer once. That was a blow! I fell away that time. When I came to, master had stopped the blood with some fur off his hat. I had to go on with my work immediately; master said I should do my stint if I worked till twelve o'clock at night. Many's the ash stick he has broken on my body; sometimes the weals remained on me for a-week; he cut <b>my</b> <b>eyelid</b> open once with a nutstick; cut a regular hole in it, and it bled all over the files I was working at. He has pulled my ears sometimes that I thought they must come off in his hand. But all this was a mere nothin to this here cut; that was serous; and if I hadn't got thro' that they do say {{there must have been a}} crowner's quest; though I think that gammon, tor old Tugsford did for one of his prentices, and the body was never found. And now you ask me if I know Hatton? I should think I did!" [...] And the lank, haggard youth laughed merrily, as if he had been recounting a series of the happiest adventures.|$|R
6000|$|Oh joy! 0 bliss of blisses! [...] My {{heart of}} hearts art thou. [...] Come bathe me with thy kisses, [...] <b>My</b> <b>eyelids</b> and my brow. [...] Hark how the wild rain hisses, [...] And the loud sea roars below.|$|E
60|$|After a time slumber lay {{so heavy}} on <b>my</b> <b>eyelids</b> that I {{stretched}} myself {{out on the}} bed once more, falling asleep almost immediately, and when I next awakened there was the belief in my mind that another day had come.|$|E
6000|$|Wondering maiden, so puzzled and fair, [...] Why dost thou murmur and ponder and stare? [...] "Why are <b>my</b> <b>eyelids</b> so {{open and}} wild?" [...] Only {{the better to}} see with, my child! [...] Only the better and clearer to view [...] Cheeks that are rosy and eyes that are blue.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she took}} me away to the still-room, and set me for an hour to make orange cakes, while she gave orders for the great dinner that we were to give that day, I knew only too well for whose sake; and if I had only known which orange cake was for my betrothed, would not it have been a bitter one! By and by my mother carried me off to be dressed. She never trusted the tiring-woman to put the {{finishing}} touches with those clumsy English fingers; and, besides, she bathed <b>my</b> swollen <b>eyelids</b> with essences, and made me rub my pale cheeks with a scarlet ribbon, speaking to me so sharply that I should not have dared to shed another tear.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here, then, I also stay," [...] said Elspat, {{rising up}} and {{speaking}} with assumed composure. [...] "I have seen <b>my</b> husband's death--my <b>eyelids</b> shall not grieve {{to look on}} the fall of my son. But MacTavish Mhor died as became the brave, with his good sword in his right hand; my son will perish like the bullock that is driven to the shambles by the Saxon owner who had bought him for a price." ...|$|R
6000|$|There isn't much {{in those}} two words; {{but they may be}} {{pronounced}} with a good deal of difference in the intonation; and Isaline's intonation did not leave one in much doubt as to how she used them. Her eyes filled again with tears, and she half started up to go. Ingrate and wretch that I was, forgetful of my promise to M. Claude, my eyes filled responsively, and I jumped to catch her and keep her from going, of course at the expense of another dreadful wrench to my poor back. [...] "Isaline," [...] I cried, unconsciously dropping the mademoiselle, and letting her see <b>my</b> brimming <b>eyelids</b> far too obviously, [...] "Isaline, do wait awhile, I implore you, I beseech you! I have something to say to you." ...|$|R
60|$|Excited {{and anxious}} though I was, slumber came to <b>my</b> <b>eyelids</b> {{within a very}} few moments after I had {{stretched}} myself out to rest, and I was all unconscious {{of what might be}} happening around me until a light pressure on my shoulder caused me to spring to a sitting posture very suddenly.|$|E
60|$|I closed <b>my</b> <b>eyelids,</b> and imagination, {{taking up}} the thread of thought, shot its swift shuttle back across the ages, weaving a picture on their {{blackness}} so real and vivid in its details that I could almost for a moment think that I had triumphed o'er the Past, and that my spirit's eyes had pierced the mystery of Time.|$|E
60|$|I did so, and {{he rubbed}} his paste on to <b>my</b> <b>eyelids.</b> At first it burnt me, then my head swam strangely. Presently this effect passed off, and my brain was {{perfectly}} clear again, but I could not feel the ground with my feet. Indaba-zimbi {{led me to the}} side of the stream. Beneath us was a pool of beautifully clear water.|$|E
60|$|I remember, as my sobs died down, that I became {{interested}} in watching the strange light-effects produced by partially opening and closing <b>my</b> tear-wet <b>eyelids.</b> Then I began to investigate, and found that I was not so very badly damaged by my fall. I had lost some hair and hide, here and there; the sharp and jagged end of a broken branch had thrust fully an inch into my forearm; and my right hip, which had borne the brunt of my contact with the ground, was aching intolerably. But these, after all, were only petty hurts. No bones were broken, and in those days the flesh of man had finer healing qualities than it has to-day. Yet it was a severe fall, for I limped with my injured hip for fully a week afterward.|$|R
60|$|He {{shut the}} door once more, and locked it securely. Then he turned towards the room where I was eagerly {{watching}} him through that narrow key-hole. How I {{knew what was coming}} next I can never tell, but I did know somehow that they were moving across once more to my hiding place. Fear supplied me with strength and agility. Dragging my leg after me again with breathless haste, I managed to scramble back into my bed somehow, and, pulling the sheet over me, to feign sleep, before those two savage devotees of a dead religion were once more leaning over the pillow beside me. Next instant, I heard the door pushed cautiously open a second time; and peering afresh through <b>my</b> closed <b>eyelids,</b> I saw Kalaua and his nameless satellite steal over softly to where I lay half dead with terror and excitement.|$|R
6000|$|... "Such, briefly, was {{the state}} of affairs in October, 1804. At the {{beginning}} of that month I had been wounded (a trifling scratch, cutting off <b>my</b> left upper <b>eyelid,</b> a bit of my cheek, and my under lip), and I was obliged to leave Biggs in command of my Irregulars, whilst I retired for my wounds to an English station at Furruckabad, alias Futtyghur--it is, as every twopenny postman knows, at the apex of the Dooab. We have there a cantonment, and thither I went for the mere sake of the surgeon and the sticking-plaster.|$|R
