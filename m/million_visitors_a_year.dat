By 2011, Gibraltar was attracting over 10 <b>million</b> <b>visitors</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> compared to a population of 29,752, giving it one of the highest tourist-to-resident ratios in the world.|$|E

40|$|Is it {{possible}} for a territory receiving four <b>million</b> foreign <b>visitors</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> and having more than a million touristic houses not to be touristic? "Sun & Beach" tourism is often related to what is known as residential tourism, a modality based on the slow rotation of touristic beds. However, the touristic nature of this modality, is an ongoing debate since the economical profits for the destination region are not based on services but on real estate business. This article argues {{from the point of view}} of architectural and urban form, that residential tourism is not a touristic activity. To that end, it studies the Spanish "Costa Blanca" an area specialized in accommodating the long-term tourist.

Finally, and more importantly, some of the social grievances that brought Arab protestors to Cairo’s Tahrir Square and its equivalents elsewhere are not unfamiliar to Russians: unaccountable authorities, rampant corruption, and official arrogance and contempt for the ordinary people.

40|$|Abstract: Krkonose Mountains (the Giant Mountains in Czech) as {{the highest}} {{mountains}} of the Czech Republic belong to the most visited middle-european mountains as they are well facilitated for both summer and winter outdoor recreation. More than 8 <b>million</b> <b>visitors</b> within <b>a</b> <b>year</b> means very serious tourism load on the mountain landscape and ecosystems. Primary impacts (e. g. disturbing plants and animals by trampling and noise, soil erosion or cummulation of rubish) together with secondary impacts of tourism development (a. g. arrising of accomodation capacity, impact on traditional landscape infrastructure by reebuilding of original small mountain chalets, nonsufficient disposal of waste, transport of allochtone organisms) create very cotraversional background for sustainable use of the mountains which are the oldest national park of the Czech Republic.

50|$|Early {{residents}} {{soon realized}} that tourism {{was destined to be}} more profitable than mining, and {{by the turn of the}} 20th century the Grand Canyon was a well-known tourist destination. Most visitors made the gruelling trip from nearby towns to the South Rim by stagecoach. In 1901 the Grand Canyon Railway was opened from Williams, Arizona, to the South Rim, and the development of formal tourist facilities, especially at Grand Canyon Village, increased dramatically. The Fred Harvey Company developed many facilities at the Grand Canyon, including the luxury El Tovar Hotel on the South Rim in 1905 and Phantom Ranch in the Inner Gorge in 1922. Although first afforded federal protection in 1893 as a forest reserve and later as a U.S. National Monument, the Grand Canyon did not achieve U.S. National Park status until 1919, three years after the creation of the National Park Service.
