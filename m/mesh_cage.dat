5|$|The {{main event}} steel cage match could be won only by {{climbing}} {{over the top}} of the cage all the way to the floor to win the match. Pinfalls and submission did not count, neither opponent could be disqualified, and the door to the cage would be locked for the entire match. As the cage lowered, Mike Tenay introduced the match and then handed the microphone over to AAA announcer Arturo Rivera to give the introductions in Spanish. Konnan came to the ring with both the IWC World Heavyweight Championship and the UWA Double Power Cup Championship that he had won from Perro Aguayo, although neither was on the line in the match. Once the door was locked, the two wrestlers began to brawl, with Aguayo trying to use Konnan as a ladder to climb out of the cage on more than one occasion. After a few minutes of fighting, Konnan dropped Aguayo face-first on the wire <b>mesh</b> <b>cage,</b> causing Aguayo to bleed (either by sheer impact or Aguayo secretly cutting himself to sell the brutality of the match). Once Aguayo started to bleed, Konnan began to focus on attacking Aguayo's forehead, including rubbing Aguayo's face across the cage. Moments later, both wrestlers found themselves on the top rope, fighting each other as they held on to the cage until Aguayo knocked Konnan off the top rope. Moments later, Aguayo attempted a pinfall even though the rules stated a pinfall did not matter. As the match progressed, sweat began to mix with his blood, causing his face to turn red. As Aguayo tried to climb out of the ring, Konnan leapt up with a low blow to keep his opponent in the cage. At that point, the cameras showed Eddie Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend watching the show from backstage, then moments later leaving the backstage area. As Aguayo climbed the cage, Los Gringos came to ringside and threw a cup of liquid in Aguayo's face. He then passed a set of brass knuckles to Konnan to use in the match. While at ringside, Guerrero got into a fistfight with several fans who were upset over his actions, forcing the security guards to step in and stop the fight. Following the assist by Los Gringos Locos, Konnan continued to attack Aguayo, with Aguayo ending up with his face and chest covered in blood from his head wound. At one point, Guerrero attacked the ringside referee, Pepe Casas, preventing him from stepping into the cage to check on Aguayo. When Konnan tried to escape, Los Hermanas Dinamita (Cien Caras, Máscara Año 2000, and Universo 2000) ran to ringside, attacking Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend at ringside. As Konnan straddled the cage, Cien Caras climbed up and knocked Konnan off the top and back inside the cage, allowing Aguayo to attack his opponent. Moments later, Aguayo dove off the top rope with a double stomp on Konnan and then climbed out of the cage to victory.|$|E

50|$|When kept as pets, {{they require}} a large {{enclosure}} and are fed crickets primarily but also wax worms, meal worms, and roaches - chameleons {{should have a}} varied diet. It {{should be noted that}} panther chameleons require fresh flowing air, so the use of an open air screen cage is necessary. A glass aquarium should not be used as it restricts airflow and can cause respiratory infections in the animal. Enclosure size is very important, a 2'×2'×4' <b>mesh</b> <b>cage</b> is perfect for a single adult although females could be kept in a 1.5'×1.5'×3' enclosure. A proper day and night light schedule is required along with a UVB bulb being present in the cage. The reptile requires UVB to replicate sunlight, and help its body process. A 5.0 UVB bulb should be on for 12 hours a day as well as a heat bulb to replicate the suns heat. Humidity is very important with chameleons, 50-60% humidity should be perfect for a panther chameleon, although it will not be fatal if this is not consistent. Panther Chameleons do however require the constant availability of water. When studying a Panther Chameleon you will notice that they do not drink from a dish as might be considered. A misting bottle should be used three times daily to properly hydrate the chameleon, this will also help maintain humidity, a water dripping system could be used so that water droplets form on the interior of the cage setup. The chameleon will sponge the water droplets from the surfaces of the cage using their tongue. It is very important that chameleons are not housed together as adults; there should be only one chameleon per cage. These rules could be slightly bent during breeding season by slowly introducing an opposite sex chameleon for short periods of time. Females should have many places available to lay eggs at all times, because they will lay eggs even if they have not been fertilized.|$|E

40|$|Cage {{culture of}} Tilapia is not {{suggested}} {{as a substitute}} for any known techniques in fish culture, but as one of the various techniques of obtaining more fish under controlled conditions. This fact has been very well accepted in various countries. Whererever facilities exist, this line of fish culture should be vigorously explored as a possible avenue in increasing fish production. High density stocking, management under controlled conditions, easy technique of fabricating the cage at relatively low cost, having no demand on land area, absence of prolific and effective breeding and easy availability of fish when a person needs it {{are a few of the}} attractions of the technique.
