5|$|A {{third period}} of mission {{foundations}} began in 1748 {{with the establishment}} of San Ignacio de Velasco, which was not declared a part of the World Heritage Site. The church is nonetheless a largely faithful 20th-century reconstruction – as opposed to renovation (a key criterion for inclusion in the World Heritage Site group) – of the second Jesuit templo built in 1761. In 1754 the Jesuits founded the <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> Santiago de Chiquitos. This church also is a reconstruction, dating from the early 20th century and likewise {{is not part of the}} World Heritage Site group. In 1755 the <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> Santa Ana de Velasco was founded by the Jesuit Julian Knogler; it is the most authentic of the six World Heritage Site missions dating from the colonial period. The last mission in the Chiquitania to be established was founded by the Jesuits Fr. Antonio Gaspar and Fr. José Chueca as Santo Corazón in 1760. However, nothing of the original settlement remains in the modern village.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the 20 {{years of}} {{foundational}} {{work by the}} bomber mafia resulted in {{the separation of the}} United States Air Force from the Army to become an independent military arm. The bomber mafia's strategic doctrine, changed by war and experience, helped shape the <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> the new Air Force and its Strategic Air Command.|$|E
5|$|As the Cold War ended, {{so did the}} <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> SAC, and it was disestablished on 1 June 1992.

The following month saw the last KC-135 depart and after 41 years, Loring AFB officially closed on 30 September 1994.|$|E

5|$|In 1779, the Comanches began raiding the Bucareli area, and the {{settlers}} chose to move further {{east to the}} old <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> Nacogdoches, where they founded the town of the same name.

5|$|Robert Lambourne regards Forward, {{especially}} in Dragon's Egg, as the successor of Hal Clement, whose <b>Mission</b> <b>of</b> Gravity exemplifies the most strongly science-based science fiction.

5|$|The <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> the Swiss Air Force {{historically}} {{has been to}} support ground troops (erdkampf) in repelling invasions of neutral Swiss territory, with a secondary <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> defending the sovereignty of Swiss airspace. During World War II this doctrine was severely tested when Switzerland was literally {{caught in the middle}} of an air war and subjected to both attacks and intrusions by aircraft of all combatants. Its inability to prevent such violations of its neutrality led for a period to a complete cessation of air intercepts, followed by a practice of coercing small numbers of intruders to submit to internment.|$|E
