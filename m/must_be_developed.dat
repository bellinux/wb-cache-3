The prime goal of any educational system <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>developing</b> individuals with high integrity levels. When our assessment lacks fairness, reliability, and validity, it will encourage cheating. In all the success stories, assessment motivated and spurred the learner to excel. This provides evidence for positive washback effect of assessment when it is practiced properly. As it was the case in most of these stories, assessment was practiced formatively in an ongoing manner.|$|R

2500|$|A key {{property}} {{of a formal}} language {{is the level of}} difficulty required to decide whether a given word is in the language.

[...] A language is called computable (synonyms: recursive, decidable) if there is a computable function [...] such that for each word [...] over the alphabet, [...] if the word is in the language and [...] if the word is not in the language. Thus a language is computable just in case there is a procedure that is able to correctly tell whether arbitrary words are in the language.|$|E
2500|$|If {{the aquifer}} is suitable, {{all of the}} {{associated}} infrastructure <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> from scratch, increasing the development costs compared to depleted reservoirs. This includes installation of wells, extraction equipment, pipelines, dehydration facilities, and possibly compression equipment. Since the aquifer initially contains water {{there is little or}} no naturally occurring gas in the formation and of the gas injected some will be physically unrecoverable. As a result, aquifer storage typically requires significantly more cushion gas than depleted reservoirs; up to 80% of the total gas volume. Most aquifer storage facilities were developed when the price of natural gas was low, meaning this cushion gas was inexpensive to sacrifice. [...] With rising gas prices aquifer storage becomes more expensive to develop.|$|E
2500|$|Creating shared {{value or}} CSV {{is based on}} the idea that {{corporate}} success and social welfare are interdependent. A business needs a healthy, educated workforce, sustainable resources and adept government to compete effectively.

The Harvard Business Review article Strategy & Society: The Link between Competitive Advantage and Corporate Social Responsibility provided examples of companies that have developed deep linkages between their business strategies and CSR. CSV acknowledges trade-offs between short-term profitability and social or environmental goals, but emphasizes the opportunities for competitive advantage from building a social value proposition into corporate strategy.
