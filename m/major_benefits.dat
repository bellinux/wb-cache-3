25|$|One of the <b>major</b> <b>benefits</b> {{provided}} by COFDM is in rendering radio broadcasts relatively immune to multipath distortion and signal fading due to atmospheric conditions or passing aircraft. Proponents of COFDM argue it resists multipath {{far better than}} 8VSB. Early 8VSB DTV (digital television) receivers often had difficulty receiving a signal. Also, COFDM allows single-frequency networks, which is not possible with 8VSB.|$|E
25|$|Logistics. The {{fast moving}} host, like all {{military}} formations, needed supplies. These {{were provided by}} young boys, who were attached to a force and carried rations, cooking pots, sleeping mats, extra weapons, rations, and other material. Cattle were sometimes driven on the hoof as a movable larder. Again, such arrangements in the local context were probably nothing unusual. What was different was the systematisation and organisation, a pattern yielding <b>major</b> <b>benefits</b> when the Zulu were dispatched on military missions. Shaka's general ratio of logistic personnel was one herdboy to three men.|$|E
25|$|Usually, in {{response}} to any proposed economic development, French settlers would marshal their influence in order to reap the <b>major</b> <b>benefits.</b> For many French, such benefits were the raison d'être for their living in Tunisia. If the local French administrator on occasion decided against them, they would hasten to appeal to their political contacts in Paris. These they carefully cultivated, e.g., through the large, political pressure group Parti-Colonial. A growing conflict naturally emerged between {{the interests of the}} settlers and those of Tunisians; a struggle which became increasingly sour. The French officials themselves were sometimes uncomfortably divided as to which course to take, and exactly how to take it.|$|E

25|$|The <b>major</b> <b>benefits</b> of {{this tactic}} {{is that the}} team is in {{complete}} control over its opponents. Meanwhile, by knocking the ball around, opponents playing the pressing game can easily tire. And should an opportunity suddenly arise, defence may be quickly switched to attack. A major downfall is that because the accuracy of passes needs to be high, short passes between the players are required. This significantly narrows {{the gap between the}} attack, midfield and defence (usually, the latter is forced to push up). So if the opponent gains possession, a long ball could effectively open up the defence. Similarly, if it is the attack and midfield that need to drop back, the team will have little chances of counter-attacking even if possession is won back.|$|E
25|$|Finland's {{participation}} in the war brought <b>major</b> <b>benefits</b> to Germany. The Soviet fleet was blockaded in the Gulf of Finland, so that the Baltic was freed for the training of German submarine crews {{as well as for}} German shipping, especially for the transport of vital iron ore from northern Sweden and nickel and rare metals (needed in steel processing) from the Petsamo area. The Finnish front secured the northern flank of the German Army Group North in the Baltic states. The sixteen Finnish divisions tied down numerous Soviet troops, put pressure on Leningrad (although Mannerheim refused to attack it directly), and threatened the Murmansk railway. Additionally, Sweden was further isolated and was increasingly pressured to comply with German and Finnish wishes, though with limited success.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} modern water {{management}} in Egypt {{begins with the}} construction of the Old Aswan Dam in 1902 and barrages on the Nile in the 19th and early 20th century. The Old Aswan Dam partially stored the waters of the Nile to allow the growing of multiple crops per year in the Nile Delta, while the barrages raised the water level of the Nile so that water could be diverted into large irrigation channels running in parallel to the river. The water regime of the river was changed fundamentally in 1970 when the Aswan High Dam was completed, eliminating the annual Nile flood. The dam brought <b>major</b> <b>benefits</b> such as increased water availability for Egyptian agriculture leading to higher income and employment, hydropower production, flood control, improved navigation, and the creation of fisheries in Lake Nasser. But it also had environmental and social impacts including resettlement, loss of fertile silt that now accumulates in the reservoir behind the dam, waterlogging combined with an increase in soil salinity, and increased coastal erosion.|$|E

500|$|The curved design offered two <b>major</b> <b>benefits</b> to the {{structure}} of the building. [...] First, curved designs, such as that found in Calatrava's Turning Torso in Malmö, Sweden, tend to add to the strength of a structure. [...] A similar principle has been used in the past with curved stadium roofs. [...] In addition to structural support, the curved face of the exterior would minimize wind forces. [...] In rectangular buildings, a fluid wind flow puts pressure on the windward face of the building; while air moves around it, a suction is applied to the leeward face. [...] This often causes a sway in tall buildings usually counteracted, at least partially, by stiffening {{the structure}} or by using a dynamic wind damper. [...] Since the curved design of the Chicago Spire would not completely negate wind forces, a tapering concrete core and twelve shear walls radiating from it were planned to counteract the remaining wind load.|$|E

2500|$|GM food's {{economic}} value to farmers {{is one of}} its <b>major</b> <b>benefits,</b> including in developing nations. A 2010 study found that Bt corn provided economic benefits of $6.9 billion over the previous 14 years in five Midwestern states. The majority ($4.3 billion) [...] accrued to farmers producing non-Bt corn. This was attributed to European corn borer populations reduced by exposure to Bt corn, leaving fewer to attack conventional corn nearby. Agriculture economists calculated that [...] "world surplus [...] $240.3 million for 1996. Of this total, the largest share (59%) went to U.S. farmers. Seed company Monsanto received the next largest share (21%), followed by US consumers (9%), {{the rest of the world}} (6%), and the germplasm supplier, Delta & Pine Land Company of Mississippi (5%)." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1988, Garcia {{agreed to}} perform at several <b>major</b> <b>benefits</b> {{including}} the [...] "Soviet American Peace Walk" [...] concert at the Band Shell, in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, that drew 25,000 people. He was asked to play by longtime friend and fellow musician, Pete Sears, who played piano with all the bands that day, and also procured all the other musicians. Garcia, Mickey Hart and Steve Parish played the show, then were given a police escort to a Grateful Dead show across the bay later that night. Garcia also played with Nick Gravenites and Pete Sears at a benefit given for Vietnam Veteran and peace activist Brian Willson, who lost both legs when a train carrying weapons to military dictatorships in El Salvador ran over him at Concord Naval Base in California.|$|E
2500|$|The actual {{engraving}} {{is traditionally}} {{done by a}} combination of pressure and manipulating the work-piece. The traditional [...] "hand push" [...] process is still practiced today, but modern technology has brought various mechanically assisted engraving systems. Most pneumatic engraving systems require an air source that drives air through a hose into a handpiece, which resembles a traditional engraving handle in many cases, that powers a mechanism (usually a piston). The air is actuated by either a foot control (like a gas pedal or sewing machine) or newer palm / hand control. This mechanism replaces either the [...] "hand push" [...] effort or the effects of a hammer. The internal mechanisms move at speeds up to 15,000 strokes per minute, thereby greatly reducing the effort needed in traditional hand engraving. These types of pneumatic systems are used for power assistance only and do not guide or control the engraving artist. One of the <b>major</b> <b>benefits</b> of using a pneumatic system for hand engraving is the reduction of fatigue and decrease in time spent working.|$|E
