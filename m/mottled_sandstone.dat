25|$|Now the Wilmslow Formation, (part of the Sherwood Sandstone Group), {{the lower}} Triassic was {{previously}} a threefold division, the Lower <b>Mottled</b> <b>Sandstone,</b> The Pebble Beds and the Upper <b>Mottled</b> <b>Sandstone,</b> (only the later is seen at Alderley) which merged into the Conglomerates {{of the upper}} Triassic. The Upper <b>Mottled</b> <b>Sandstone</b> now the lower Wilmslow Member is a medium to coarse-grained friable false-bedded sandstone with abrupt colour changes from bright red to white. It is composed mainly of rounded grains but sub-angular grains also occur. Normally the rock lacks coherence and weathers into sand down to 6m and even unweathered rock can be crushed to sand easily. However near faults, ghost crystals of barites make the sandstone harder and resistant.|$|E
25|$|The {{widespread}} {{deposits of}} middle sands have been extensively worked around the Cheshire area for building purposes, they vary from clean sharp sand to somewhat loamy deposits {{with layers of}} clay. Whilst never quarried in any great quantity at Alderley, the Upper <b>Mottled</b> <b>Sandstone</b> in the main is incoherent enough to be quarried for sand and there are large reserves available {{at the foot of}} the Edge escarpment near the Hough.|$|E
25|$|Three {{other main}} beds are seen at Alderley Edge. The first is friable <b>mottled</b> <b>sandstone</b> {{similar to the}} Upper <b>Mottled</b> <b>Sandstone,</b> the Beacon Lodge Sandstone which attains a {{thickness}} of 12m and {{can be seen at}} Beacon Lodge resting above the conglomerates. The second is a conglomerate which overlies the Brynlow and is seen by the site of the old mines and is thus called the West Mine Conglomerate. There are ten upward fining cycles in this rock and it has a thickness of 40m. The third rock is creamy white sandstone, which lacks the pebbly beds and is upward fining; it overlies the West Mine Conglomerate and is seen in outcrops at Brynlow. This is the Wood Mine Sandstone it has a thickness of 16m. Two other minor beds are seen to the southeast of these areas a single cycle conglomerate/sandstone/marl of 9m thickness known as the Brynlow conglomerate and a final bed that overlies the Brynlow Conglomerate and is named the Nether Alderley Sandstone. On top of the Nether Alderley Sandstone lie the Mercia Mudstones which attain a thickness of 300m, but these are only seen on the lower plains, it is in these beds that the halite lies.|$|E

50|$|Mathura School of Art, {{style of}} Buddhist visual art that {{flourished in the}} Mathura, from the 2nd century bc to the 12th century A.D; its most {{distinctive}} contributions were made during the Kushan and Gupta periods (1st-6th century A.d). Images in the <b>mottled</b> red <b>sandstone</b> from the nearby Sīkri quarries are found widely distributed over north central India, attesting to Mathurā’s importance as an exporter of sculpture. The Mathura School images {{are related to the}} earlier yakṣa (male nature deity) figures, a resemblance particularly evident in the colossal standing Buddha images of the early Kushān period. In these, and in the more representative seated Buddhas, the overall effect is one of enormous energy. The shoulders are broad, the chest swells, and the legs are firmly planted with feet spaced apart.|$|R
60|$|There {{are many}} Egyptian obelisks in Rome--tall, snakelike spires of red <b>sandstone,</b> <b>mottled</b> with strange writings, which {{remind us of}} the pillars of flame which led the {{children}} of Israel through the desert away from the land of the Pharaohs; but more wonderful than these to look upon is this gaunt, wedge-shaped pyramid standing here in this Italian city, unshattered amid the ruins and wrecks of time, looking older than the Eternal City itself, like terrible impassiveness turned to stone. And so in the Middle Ages men supposed this to be the sepulchre of Remus, who was slain by his own brother at the founding of the city, so ancient and mysterious it appears; but we have now, perhaps unfortunately, more accurate information about it, and know that it is the tomb of one Caius Cestius, a Roman gentleman of small note, who died about 30 B.C.|$|R
25|$|The area {{rests on}} Bunter upper <b>mottled</b> <b>sandstone</b> from the Triassic period. These sands were very {{useful in the}} {{manufacture}} of moulds, which were extensively used in the metal working industries in Birmingham. Much {{of the rest of the}} city centre lies on Keuper sandstone, which is better suited for foundry work. The conservation area sits on a flat-topped hill, orientated north-south. The land falls steeply west towards Icknield Street and southeast to the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal. It rises southeast from the canal to Great Charles Street Queensway. The highest point is located on Warstone Lane.|$|E
25|$|The lower {{sandstone}} (Upper <b>Mottled</b> <b>Sandstone)</b> {{has a full}} {{thickness of}} 305m generally a reddy brown colour with some white patches, which give it its name, these patches are often associated with organic nuclei. The sandstone has two distinct types, a bright dark red known as the Moulding Sand and mottled paler sandstone. The Moulding Sand is so called after its use in the foundry industry for making the casting moulds. Resting on top is a conglomerate, which attains thickness of 30m; it is the Engine Vein Conglomerate. These conglomerates {{are made up of}} angular grained sands which were laid down in cyclic sequences. This sequence is an upward fining sequence of three or four cycles.|$|E
2500|$|Kirkley Ditch fault - The Keuper {{sandstone}} conglomerates dipping WSW at, and to {{the south}} of Kirkley Ditch, are clearly detached by a fault from the country to the west underlain by Upper <b>Mottled</b> <b>Sandstone</b> and from the main mass of Keuper conglomerate capping Alderley Edge.

2500|$|The {{majority}} of the lower Triassic clastic sediments originated from a Variscan source area in northern France with minor local input. Some Alderley Edge conglomerates, consist of material originating from the Pennine block to the east. Breccias with clasts of local origin, are well developed {{on the edges of}} the basin and are interpreted as gravel fans at the mouths of wadis emerging from mountainous areas bordering the depositional basin. Others show long distance river transport by a powerful river system [...] originating in the Armorican Massif. The basal conglomerates are made up of hard sandstone which contains angular grains. At Alderley Edge the junction is quite sharp it could be regarded as an unconformity. However interdigitation is found as if to testify against an unconformity. Mappable beds showing all the characteristics of the Upper <b>Mottled</b> <b>Sandstone</b> are found between the two basal beds of the conglomerates.|$|E

40|$|The Mufulira copper {{deposits}} {{are in the}} Lower Roan, lowest subdivision of the I(atanga Sequence, overlying {{an early}} Precambrian Basement Complex. The Lower Roan {{is described as a}} transgressiv. e marine sequence; at Mufulira three essentially stratabound ore bodies are contained in identical phases of a cyclic succession. Large-scale cross-bedded units in the Footwall formation are interpreted as subaqueous dunes in a high-energy shallow marine environment, refuting their generally accepted eolian origin. Analysis of cross-bedding in {{the lower part of the}} Ore formation and in the Footwall formation throughout the mine reveals a bimodal distribution of paleocurrent directions with southerly offshore and northeasterly longshore directions. In the west, southerly directions with little variation around their mean vector indicate fiuviatile channels. The typical host rock of the economic mineralization at Mufulira is a fine-grained carbonaceous wacke. This wacke was deposited in basin-like depressions of the near-shore seafloor, sheltered from the open sea by shoals. Stagnating bottom waters, re-sulting. in anaerobic conditions, may have contributed to the exceptional conditions under which synsedimentary sulfides could form. These original sulfide deposits were probably of a low grade and were later enriched, possibly during diagenesis as is indicated by diagenetic mottling in sandstones, by mineral zoning, and by copper sulfide distribution in and around shale fragments enclosed in coarse sandstone. Clean arenites and con-glomeratic sandstones in the lowest parts of the ore bodies and in their footwall beds were ideal channelways for laterally migrating copper-bearing fluids. The economic concentration of copper was principally dependent upon the presence of a reducing car-bonaceous-sulfureous environment that was associated with the carbonaceous wacke and a <b>mottled</b> <b>sandstone.</b> A unique relationship of copper sulfides to a particular sedimentary facies is not observed, but sedimentological trends are consistent with the distribution pattern of the sulfides and can be used in exploration for this type of deposit...|$|E
