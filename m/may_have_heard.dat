5|$|The texts for {{the early}} cantatas were drawn mostly from biblical {{passages}} and hymns. Features characteristic of his later cantatas, such as recitatives and arias on contemporary poetry, were not yet present, although Bach <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> them in oratorios by Buxtehude, or even earlier. Instead, these early cantatas include 17th-century elements such as motets and chorale concertos. They often begin with an instrumental sinfonia or sonata (sonatina). The following table lists the seven extant works composed by Bach until 1708, when {{he moved on to}} the Weimar court.|$|E

25|$|Witnesses saw Moseley {{enter his}} car, drive away and return ten minutes later. Shadowing {{his face with}} a wide-brimmed hat, he {{systematically}} searched the parking lot, the train station and an apartment complex, eventually finding Genovese, who was barely conscious and lying in a hallway {{at the back of the}} building, where a locked door had prevented her from going inside. Out of view of the street and of those who <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> or seen any sign of the initial attack, Moseley stabbed Genovese several more times before raping her, stealing $49 from her and running away again. The attacks spanned approximately half an hour, and knife wounds in Genovese's hands suggested that she attempted to defend herself from him. A neighbor, Sophia Farrar, found her shortly after and held her in her arms.|$|E

25|$|Some zoologists hypothesise {{that some}} animal species have {{an ability to}} sense subsonic Rayleigh waves from an {{earthquake}} or a tsunami. If correct, monitoring their behaviour could provide advance warning of earthquakes, tsunami etc. However, the evidence is controversial and is not widely accepted. There are unsubstantiated claims about the Lisbon quake that some animals escaped to higher ground, while many other animals in the same areas drowned. The phenomenon was also noted by media sources in Sri Lanka in the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. It is possible that certain animals (e.g., elephants) <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> {{the sounds of the}} tsunami as it approached the coast. The elephants' reaction was {{to move away from the}} approaching noise. By contrast, some humans went to the shore to investigate and many drowned as a result.|$|E
500|$|In 1918, LDS {{president}} Joseph F.

In his 1966 book Mormon Doctrine, LDS theologian (and, later, apostle) Bruce R. McConkie wrote that [...] "From time to time, accounts of various supposed visions, revelations, and prophecies are spread forth by and among the Latter-day Saints, who should know better than to believe or spread such false information.

In the middle section steady steps picture [...] "" [...] (Yet go with me, my Savior). The final part combines both elements. Gardiner notes that Bach uses the winds and strings in concerting choirs (cori spezzati), enforced by positioning them on galleries, one of them right, the other left of the singers. The technique had been practised in Venice in the late sixteenth century and introduced in Germany by composers such as Heinrich Schütz who studied in Venice. Gardiner observes also a hint at the style of French opera which Bach <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard,</b> traveling as a boy in northern Germany, at the Hamburg opera, in Celle or Lüneburg.|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, {{the town}} of Chichibu (秩父), Japan, {{under the name of}} [...] "Tokyo Theatre Company", {{produced}} an adaptation of The Mikado in Japanese.

Although the Hepburn system of transliteration (in which the name of the town appears as [...] "Chichibu") is usually found today, it was very common in the 19th century to use the Kunrei system, in which the name 秩父 appears as [...] "Titibu".
