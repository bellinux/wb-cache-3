500|$|In Ronnie, his 2007 autobiography, Wood {{writes that}} The Wick was [...] "a hive of {{recording}} activity {{as well as}} a thriving debauchery camp" [...] during the year-long creation of his first solo release, I've Got My Own Album to Do (1974). The album title originated from contributors such as Harrison and Mick Jagger [...] "nagging <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> them go home" [...] and work on their own projects. Wood assisted Jagger in writing and recording the Rolling Stones' 1974 single [...] "It's Only Rock 'n Roll" [...] during this period, and he similarly reciprocated Harrison, by playing on the former Beatle's Christmas single, [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong".|$|E
500|$|By 1971, Butterfield had {{purchased}} his first house, in rural Woodstock, New York, and began enjoying family life {{with his second}} wife, Kathy Peterson, and their infant son, Lee. According to Maria Muldaur, {{she and her husband}} were frequent dinner guests, which usually involved sitting around a piano and singing songs. She doubted her abilities, but [...] "it was Butter that first encouraged <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> loose and just sing the blues [...] not to worry about singing pretty or hitting all the right notes... He loosened all the levels of self-consciousness and doubt out of me... And he'll forever live in my heart for that and for respecting me as a fellow musician." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the face}} of the rock, south from the town, is the famous stone, known by the name of the mistress-stone; it resembles a door exactly; and is in the very front of this rock, which is twenty or thirty fathom [...] {{perpendicular}} in height, the figure of it being discernible about the distance of a mile; upon the lintel of this door, every bachelor-wooer is by an ancient custom obliged in honour to give a specimen of his affection for the love of his mistress, and it is thus; he is to stand on his left foot, having the one half of his sole over the rock, and then he draws the right foot further out to the left, and in this posture bowing, he puts both his fists further out to the right foot; and then after he has performed this, he has acquired no small reputation, being always after it accounted worthy of the finest mistress in the world: they firmly believe that this achievement is always attended with the desired success.This being the custom of the place, one of the inhabitants very gravely desired <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> him know the time limited by me for trying of this piece of gallantry before I design’d to leave the place, that he might attend me; I told him this performance would have a quite contrary effect upon me, by robbing me both of my life and mistress at the same moment.|$|E
500|$|Two main {{charges were}} brought to the House of Commons against Marlborough: first, an {{assertion}} that over nine years he had illegally received more than £63,000 from the bread and transport contractors in the Netherlands; second, that he had taken 2.5% from the pay of the foreign troops in English pay, amounting to £280,000. Despite Marlborough's refutations (claiming ancient precedent for the first allegation, and, for the second, producing a warrant signed by the Queen in 1702 authorising him to make the deductions in lieu of secret-service money for the war), the findings were enough for Harley to persuade the Queen to release her Captain-General. On 29 December 1711 (O.S.), before the charges had been examined, Anne, who owed to him the success and glory of her reign, sent her letter of dismissal: [...] "I am sorry for your own sake the reasons are become so public which makes it necessary for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> you know you have render'd it impracticable for you to continue yet longer in my service". The Tory dominated Parliament concluded by a substantial majority that, [...] "the taking of several sums of money annually by the Duke of Marlborough from the contractor for foraging the bread and wagons... was unwarrantable and illegal", and that the 2.5% deducted from the pay of foreign troops [...] "is public money and ought to be accounted for". When his successor, the Duke of Ormonde, left London for The Hague to take command of British forces he went, noted Bishop Burnet, with [...] "the same allowances that had been lately voted criminal in the Duke of Marlborough".|$|E

2500|$|In November 1979, while {{chairman}} of the CFR, David Rockefeller became embroiled in an international incident when he and Henry Kissinger, along with John J. McCloy and Rockefeller aides, persuaded President Jimmy Carter through the State Department to admit the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, into the US for hospital treatment for lymphoma. This action directly precipitated {{what is known as}} the Iran hostage crisis and placed Rockefeller under intense media scrutiny (particularly from The New York Times) for the first time in his public life. In his book White House Diary, Carter wrote of the affair, [...] "April 9 [...] David Rockefeller came in, apparently to induce <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the shah come to the United States. Rockefeller, Kissinger, and Brzezinski seem to be adopting this as a joint project..." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 12, 2012, Tyler {{announced}} that he would be leaving American Idol after two seasons, with a statement saying, [...] "After some long... hard... thoughts...

I strayed from my first love, AEROSMITH, and I’m back— but instead of begging on my hands and knees, I got two fists in the air and I’m kicking the door open with my band. The next few years are going to be dedicated to kicking some serious ass— the ultimate in auditory takeover..." [...] However, the reports suggest that Tyler was dumped by the American Idol bosses. Tyler has since indicated that his troubles with his bandmates were the primary reason he signed up to do American Idol. He was replaced by Keith Urban.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{directed}} mindfulness {{so that it}} {{was keeping}} closely aware of the mind, following it to know what happens at death. Mindfulness stayed with the heart right up to the final moment when only the barest awareness remained. A feeling was present that to release that faint degree of awareness would be death. At this point, the question became whether {{it would be better for}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> go and allow death to take place. I felt that my heart was currently quite pure and that if I were to let go, I wouldn't lose because of it. Although there also remained a delicate feeling that expressed the thought that: 'rather than letting go and die, by remaining alive, I could continue to be of benefit to other people. If it were all to finish here with my death, then it could only be to my own purely personal advantage. Also, people wouldn't know the full circumstances and causes of this death. If that's the case, it's certainly better not to let myself die.' I therefore attempted to wiggle and move my hands and feet, until I came around." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 24 August 2008, Georgian {{president}} Mikheil Saakashvili had {{a lengthy}} televised speech. He remembered that after 2004 Adjara crisis he phoned President Putin and thanked him. [...] "I remember that conversation very well; {{in response to}} my polite remarks, he said roughly: ‘Now remember, in Adjara we did not intervene, but you won’t have any gifts from us in South Ossetia or Abkhazia.’ That’s {{what he said to}} me." [...] He then said [...] "I suppose that Russia started thinking about military intervention in Georgia sometime in 2007." [...] " [...] Russia announced a withdrawal from the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, limiting military forces in [...] and the Caucasus." [...] Saakashvili then slammed the EU’s reaction to Russia’s admission of violating Georgian airspace in July 2008. [...] "This admission by Russia was a clear sign that they were testing western reaction," [...] he stated. Saakashvili said that his first meeting with Medvedev in June 2008 in St. Petersburg was good; while at the next meeting with Medvedev in Astana in July 2008, the Russian president’s stance was changed and [...] "it was clear that they [...] were preparing for something bad." [...] Saakashvili said that Georgia had expected a Russian attack from Abkhazia, rather than from South Ossetia, so major forces of the Georgian army were deployed in the Georgia's west. He said that as the situation deteriorated on 7 August, [...] "we moved one brigade [...] closer to South Ossetia, and later another [...] as well." [...] "But our major forces were still deployed in the west; there was a brigade at Senaki [...] and we did not call back our brigade from Iraq, because I was deeply convinced up to the last minute that Russia would not engage in such a large-scale provocation," [...] he said. [...] "Although we were under fire from 120mm mortar launchers, I announced a unilateral ceasefire; at that time we already had one dead soldier in the village of Avnevi and four others were wounded; [...] Kezerashvili was begging <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> him open artillery fire, because, he was telling me, otherwise he was unable to bring [...] from [...] But my response was that we could not open fire whatever happened," [...] he said. Saakashvili also said that the Russian army had moved into South Ossetia before the war had even started. [...] "When we ask our western partners: didn't you see them coming, they respond that their satellites were directed mainly on Iraq and that they could not fly over , but it was impossible {{to see what was happening}} on the ground because it was cloudy. So it was a serious failure of international intelligence services; they would not have hidden this information from us, if they had known it; but they also did not know it," [...] Saakashvili said.|$|E
