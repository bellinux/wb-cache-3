500|$|In {{defining}} {{his method}} for creating Tron: Legacy, Kosinski declared that his main {{objective was to}} [...] "make it feel real", adding that he wanted the audience to feel like filming actually occurred in the fictional universe. For this, many physical sets were built, as Kosinski [...] "wanted the materials to be real materials: glass, concrete, steel, so it {{had this kind of}} visceral quality." [...] Kosinski collaborated with people who specialized in fields outside of the film industry, such as architecture and automotive design. The looks for the Grid aimed for a more advanced version of the cyberspace visited by Flynn in Tron, which Lisberger described as [...] "a virtual Galapagos, which has evolved on its own". As Bailey put, the Grid would not have any influence from the internet as it had turned offline from the real world in the 1980s, and [...] "grew on its own server into something powerful and unique". Kosinski added that as the simulation became more realistic, it would try to become closer to the real world with environmental effects such as rain and wind, and production designer Darren Gilford stated {{that there would be a}} juxtaposition between the variety of texture and color of the real world introduction in contrast with the [...] "clean surfaces and lines" [...] of the Grid. As the design team considered the lights a major part of the Tron look, particularly for being set in a dark world—described by effects art director Ben Procter as [...] "dark silhouetted objects dipped in an atmosphere with clouds in-between, in a kind of Japanese landscape painting" [...] where [...] "the self-lighting of the objects is the <b>main</b> <b>light</b> source"—lighting was spread through every prop on the set, including the floor in Flynn's hideout. Lisberger also stated that while the original Tron [...] "reflected the way cyberspace was", the sequel was [...] "going to be like a modern day, like contemporary plus, in terms of how much resolution, the texturing, the feel, the style", adding that [...] "it doesn’t have that Pong Land vibe to it anymore." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wigwags {{manufactured}} by WRRS and its predecessors were once numerous in the Midwest, with almost every town {{using them to}} protect their main crossings. The most common model was called the Autoflag #5. They functioned {{in much the same}} way as the Magnetic Flagmen. They utilized alternating electromagnets to swing a shaft with an attached illuminated banner. Bells were not integral to the devices as with the Magnetic Flagmen. They employed standard bells that were used on other types of signals, and mounted either to the mast or to a bracket on the top of the center harp style, as in the Devil's Lake, WI photo. Autoflag #5s were widely used on the C, CB, Illinois Central, Soo Line and the Milwaukee Road. A few were also used on the Louisville & Nashville and the Gulf, Mobile & Ohio as well as other roads in the US and Canada. Most of these wigwags were removed in the 1970-1980s as crossings were updated. They were made in both a lower quadrant style and a center harp style similar to the Magnetic Flagman's peachbasket style. [...] Early on, there were Autoflag [...] #5s that would hold the banner behind a shield much like the Magnetic Flagman disappearing banner-style. [...] These were replaced as time went on with the standard two-position banner that hung vertically when not energized. [...] Several railroad, such as the GM and CB, had a second light below the <b>main</b> <b>light</b> on the banner. [...] This served as a second reserve light in case of failure of both bulbs in the <b>main</b> <b>light</b> and as a signal maintainers' warning of a burned out bulb without having to climb up and open the <b>main</b> <b>light</b> to check each bulb. [...] If the secondary light was illuminated, there was an issue with burned out bulbs in the <b>main</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The liquid outer core {{also appears}} to have density 5–10% lower than iron. Shibazaki and others {{estimate}} {{that it should have}} a somewhat higher proportion of hydrogen than the inner core, but there is not enough data about molten FeHx for accurate estimates. [...] Narygina and others estimate 0.5–1.0% (weight) of hydrogen in the melt. Similar, but without extrapolations in pressure, theoretical estimates give a narrower range of concentrations 0.4-0.5% (weight), however, this results to too low mean atomic mass of the inner core (43.8-46.5) and hydrogen seems to be less likely than other elements (S, Si, C, O) to be the <b>main</b> <b>light</b> alloying element in the core.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{films were}} more potent with propagandistic {{symbolism}} than others. [...] Fifth Column Mouse is a cartoon that through childlike humor and political undertones depicted a possible outcome of World War II. [...] The film {{begins with a}} bunch of mice playing and singing a song about how they never worry. [...] One mouse notices a cat looking in through a window, but is calmed when another mouse tells him that the cat cannot get inside. [...] The cat however, bursts in through the front door alerting a mouse that wears a World War II style air raid warden helmet and screams, “Lights out,” promptly turning off the <b>main</b> <b>light.</b> [...] The phrase, 'lights out,' was a popular saying during the war, especially in major cities to encourage people to turn off their lights to hinder targeting by potential enemy bombers. [...] The same mouse who said the cat could not get inside, ends up getting caught by the cat. [...] The cat tells him that he will not kill him, but will give him cheese if the mouse follows the cat's instructions. [...] During the dialogue between the two, the cat's smile resembles the Tojo bucktooth grin and it speaks with a Japanese accent. [...] Near the end, the cat screams “Now get going!” and the mouse jumps to attention and gives the infamous Nazi salute. [...] The scene cuts to the biddable mouse, now an agent of influence, telling the other mice that the cat is here to “save us and not to enslave us,” “don’t be naughty mice, but appease him” so “hurry and sign a truce.” [...] This message of appeasement and signing a truce would have been all too familiar to the adults in the theaters who were probably with their children. [...] The next clip is of the cat lounging on pillows with multiple mice tending to its every need. [...] However, when the cat reveals that he wants to eat a mouse they all scatter. [...] Inside their hole, a new mouse is encouraging the others to be strong and fight the cat. [...] The mice are then shown marching in step with hardy, confident grins on their faces with “We Did it Before and We Can Do it Again” by Robert Merrill playing in the background. [...] Amidst the construction of a secret weapon, a poster of a mouse with a rifle is shown with the bold words “For Victory: Buy Bonds and Stamps.” [...] The mice have built a mechanical dog that chases the cat out of the house. [...] Before he leaves though a mouse skins the cat with an electric razor, but leaves three short dots and a long streak of fur on his back. [...] In Morse code, the letter [...] "V" [...] is produced through dot-dot-dot-dash. [...] As depicted in many pictures but made popular by Winston Churchill, the “V” for victory sign was a popular symbol of encouragement for the Allies. [...] The cartoon ends with the mice singing, “We did it before, we did it AGAIN!” ...|$|E
