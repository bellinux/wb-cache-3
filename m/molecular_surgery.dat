40|$|Molecular neurosurgery” is {{emerging}} as a new medical concept, and is the combination of two partners: (i) a molecular neurosurgery agent, and (ii) the cognate receptor whose activation results in the selective elimination of a specific subset of neurons in which this receptor is endogenously expressed. In general, a <b>molecular</b> <b>surgery</b> agent is a selective and potent ligand, and the target is a specific cell type whose elimination is desired through the <b>molecular</b> <b>surgery</b> procedure. These target cells have the highest innate sensitivity to the <b>molecular</b> <b>surgery</b> agent usually due to the highest receptor density being in their plasma membrane. The interaction {{between the ligand and}} its receptor evokes an overactivity of the receptor. If the receptor is a ligand-activated non-selective cation channel, the overactivity of receptor leads to excess Ca 2 + and Na+ influx into the cell and finally cell death. One of the best known examples of such an interaction is the effect of ultrapotent vanilloids on TRPV 1 - expressing pain-sensing neurons. One intrathecal resiniferatoxin (RTX) dose allows for the receptor-mediated removal of TRPV 1 + neurons from the peripheral nervous system. The TRPV 1 receptor-mediated ion influx induces necrotic processes, but only in pain-sensing neurons, and usually within an hour. Besides that, target-specific apoptotic processes are also induced. Thus, as a nano-surgery scalpel, RTX removes the neurons responsible for generating pain and inflammation from the peripheral nervous system providing an option in clinical management for the treatment of morphine-insensitive pain conditions. In the future, the <b>molecular</b> <b>surgery</b> concept can also be exploited in cancer research for selectively targeting the specific tumor cell...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Optimum cytoreductive surgery {{combined}} with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) {{is essential for}} the curative treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal origin. At present, surgeons depend on visual inspection and palpation for tumour detection. Improved detection of tumour tissue using <b>molecular</b> fluorescence-guided <b>surgery</b> could not only help attain a complete cytoreduction of metastatic lesions, but might also prevent overtreatment by avoiding resection of benign lesions. METHODS: For this non-randomised, single-centre feasibility study, we enrolled patients with colorectal peritoneal metastases scheduled for cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC. 2 days before surgery, 4 · 5 mg of the near-infrared fluorescent tracer bevacizumab-IRDye 800 CW was administered intravenously. The primary objectives were to determine the safety and feasibility of <b>molecular</b> fluorescence-guided <b>surgery</b> using bevacizumab-IRDye 800 CW. <b>Molecular</b> fluorescence-guided <b>surgery</b> was deemed safe if no allergic or anaphylactic reactions were recorded and no serious adverse events were attributed to bevacizumab-IRDye 800 CW. The technique was deemed feasible if bevacizumab-IRDye 800 CW enabled detection of fluorescence signals intraoperatively. Secondary objectives were correlation of fluorescence with histopathology by back-table imaging of the fresh surgical specimen and semi-quantitative ex-vivo analyses of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue on all peritoneal lesions. Additionally, VEGF-α staining and fluorescence microscopy was done. This study is registered with the Netherlands Trial Registry, number NTR 4632. FINDINGS: Between July 3, 2014, and March 2, 2015, seven patients were enrolled in the study. One patient developed an abdominal sepsis 5 days postoperatively and another died from an asystole 4 days postoperatively, most probably due to a cardiovascular thromboembolic event. However, both serious adverse events were attributed to the surgical cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC procedure. No serious adverse events related to bevacizumab-IRDye 800 CW occurred in any of the patients. Intraoperatively, fluorescence was seen in all patients. In two patients, additional tumour tissue was detected by <b>molecular</b> fluorescence-guided <b>surgery</b> that was initially missed by the surgeons. During back-table imaging of fresh surgical specimens, a total of 80 areas were imaged, marked, and analysed. All of the 29 non-fluorescent areas were found to contain only benign tissue, whereas tumour tissue was detected in 27 of 51 fluorescent areas (53 %). Ex-vivo semi-quantification of 79 FFPE peritoneal lesions showed a tumour-to-normal ratio of 6 · 92 (SD 2 · 47). INTERPRETATION: <b>Molecular</b> fluorescence-guided <b>surgery</b> using the near-infrared fluorescent tracer bevacizumab-IRDye 800 CW is safe and feasible. This technique might be of added value for the treatment of patients with colorectal peritoneal metastases through improved patient selection and optimisation of cytoreductive surgery. A subsequent multicentre phase 2 trial is needed to make a definitive assessment of the diagnostic accuracy and the effect on clinical decision making of <b>molecular</b> fluorescence-guided <b>surgery.</b> FUNDING: FP- 7 Framework Programme BetaCure and SurgVision BV...|$|R

40|$|Point {{mutations}} in the mitochondrial (mt) tRNALeu(UUR) gene {{are responsible for}} mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), a subgroup of mitochondrial encephalomyopathic diseases. We previously showed that mt tRNALeu(UUR) with an A 3243 G or T 3271 C mutation derived from patients with MELAS are deficient in a normal taurine-containing modification (τm 5 U; 5 -taurinomethyluridine) at the anticodon wobble position. To examine decoding disorder of the mutant tRNA due to the wobble modification deficiency independent of the pathogenic point mutation itself, we used a <b>molecular</b> <b>surgery</b> technique to construct an mt tRNALeu(UUR) molecule lacking the taurine modification but without the pathogenic mutation. This “operated” mt tRNALeu(UUR) without the taurine modification showed severely reduced UUG translation but no decrease in UUA translation.

40|$|Background: Use of {{capsaicin}} or resiniferatoxin (RTX) as analgesics is {{an attractive}} therapeutic option. RTX opens the cation channel inflammatory pain/vanilloid receptor type 1 (TRPV 1) permanently and selectively removes nociceptive neurons by Ca 2 +-cytotoxicity. Paradoxically, not only nociceptors, but non-neuronal cells, including keratinocytes express full length TRPV 1 mRNA, while patient dogs and experimental animals that underwent topical treatment or anatomically targeted <b>molecular</b> <b>surgery</b> have shown neither obvious behavioral, nor pathological side effects. Methods: To address this paradox, we assessed the vanilloid sensitivity of the HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line and primary keratinocytes from skin biopsies. Results: Although both cell types express TRPV 1 mRNA, neither responded to vanilloids with Ca 2 +-cytotoxicity. Only ectopic overproduction of TRPV 1 rendered HaCaT cells sensitive to low doses (1 – 50 nM) of vanilloids. The TRPV 1 -mediated and nonreceptor specific Ca 2 +-cytotoxity ([RTX]. 15 mM) could clearly be distinguished, thus keratinocytes were indeed resistant to vanilloid-induced, TRPV 1 -mediated Ca 2 +-entry. Having a wider therapeutic window than capsaicin, RTX was effective in subnanomolar range, but even micromolar concentrations could not kill human keratinocytes. Keratinocytes showed orders of magnitudes lower TRPV 1 mRNA level than sensory ganglions, the bona fide therapeutic targets in human pain management.

Characterization and classification of over eighty classes of receptors, ion channels, transporters, signal transduction enzymes and neurotransmitter synthesis/metabolic pathways enable clinicians to understand the molecular mechanisms of the drugs they use in the practice of medicine. Radiolebelled ligands are available for all the targets of drug action enabling researchers to screen new compounds in search of better drugs. Complete pathway diagrams are available for about 20 signaling pathways which provide clues for potential targets for new drug development. Nanotechnology has the power to radically change the way cancer is diagnosed, imaged and treated. Nanoscale devices such as dendrimers can be specifically targeted to cancer cells delivering therapeutic agents within the target cells or even within specific organelles, while totally avoiding normal cells. Pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics are going to play an increasingly important role in the development of better medicines for the population and targetted therapies with better benefit/risk ratio for the individual patient. Nutrigenomics studies the interaction between nutrition and genes.

40|$|Non-thermal {{irreversible}} electroporation (IRE) {{is a new}} {{minimally invasive}} surgical technique {{that is part of}} the emerging field of <b>molecular</b> <b>surgery</b> which holds the potential to treat diseases with unprecedented accuracy. IRE utilizes electrical pulses delivered to a targeted area, producing irreversible damage to the cell membrane. While electroporation is not fully understood to date, evidence indicates that this damage is induced by the increased transmembrane potential due to high voltage pulses affecting the lipid bilayer. Because IRE does not cause thermal damage, the integrity of all other molecules and only effects cellular structures, collagen and elastin in the targeted area is preserved. Previous theoretical studies have only examined IRE in homogeneous tissues. However, tissues can be heterogeneous in two different capacities: 1) they can be intrinsically heterogeneous due to anatomy, and 2) they can be extrinsically heterogeneous due to external factors. This investigation of heterogeneous tissues studies both cases in order to expand the depth and breadth of the field of electroporation. Intrinsic Heterogeneous TissuesBecause biological structures are complex collections of diverse tissues it becomes imperative to consider intrinsic heterogeneities. In order to develop electroporation as a precise treatment in clinical applications, realistic models for pre-surgical planning are necessary. In this way, the study of heterogeneous tissues will enable refinement of electroporation as a treatment. In this chapter, three different intrinsic heterogeneous structures were taken into account: nerves, blood vessels and lactiferous ducts. The subsequent results made it clear that heterogeneities significantly impact both the temperature and electrical field distribution in surrounding tissues, indicating that heterogeneities should not be neglected. While the surrounding tissue experienced a high electrical field, the axon of the nerve, the interior of the blood vessel and the ducts experienced no electrical field. This indicates that blood vessels, nerves and lactiferous ducts adjacent to a tumor treated with electroporation have the potential to survive, while the cancerous lesion is ablated. This clearly demonstrates the importance of considering heterogeneity in IRE applications. Extrinsic Heterogeneous Tissues	Extrinsic heterogeneous tissues can be induced by various external factors. One such factor is an applied temperature gradient. Two different temperature gradients were considered in this investigation: 1) subzero temperatures, induced by cryosurgery, and 2) cooling temperatures. Cryosurgery, tissue ablation by freezing, is a well-established minimally invasive surgical technique. The goal of this investigation was to study extrinsic heterogeneous tissues induced by externally applied subzero temperatures by combining cryosurgery and electroporation. Analysis of the electric field and temperature distribution during simultaneous tissue treatment with cryosurgery and irreversible electroporation (cryoIRE) was used to study the effect of tissue freezing on electric fields. The results indicate that this combination may resolve some of the major disadvantages that occur in each technology when used alone. Because of decreased electrical conductivity in the frozen tissue, this region experienced temperature induced magnified electric fields in comparison to IRE delivered to unfrozen tissue, the control case. This suggests that freezing confines and magnifies the electric fields to those regions; a targeting capability unattainable in traditional electroporation. This analysis also shows how temperature induced magnified and focused IRE can be used to ablate cells in the high subzero freezing region of a cryosurgical lesion, in which cells can be resistant to freezing damage. The next heterogeneous tissues that were studied were heterogeneities extrinsically produced by cooling. This chapter explores the hypothesis that non-subzero temperature dependent electrical parameters of tissue can also be used to modulate the outcome of IRE protocols, providing a new means for controlling and optimizing this minimally invasive surgical procedure. This chapter investigates two different applications of cooling temperatures applied during IRE. The first case utilizes an electrode which simultaneously delivers electric fields and cooling temperatures. The subsequent results demonstrate that changes in electrical properties due to temperature produced by this configuration can substantially magnify and confine the electric fields in the cooled regions while almost eliminating electric fields in surrounding regions. This method can be used to increase precision in IRE procedures, and eliminate muscle contractions and damage to adjacent tissues. The second configuration considered introduces a third probe that is not electrically active and only applies cooling boundary conditions. This second configuration demonstrates that with this probe geometry the temperature induced changes in electrical properties of tissue substantially reduce the electric fields in the cooled regions. This novel treatment can potentially be used to protect sensitive tissues from the effect of IRE. Perhaps the most important conclusion of this investigation is that temperature is a powerful and accessible mechanism to modulate and control electric fields in biological tissues and can therefore be used to optimize and control IRE treatments...|$|E

Protein truncating mutations in the huge dystrophin gene typically lead to {{the most common and}} serious form of childhood muscle wasting, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Exon skipping strategies can be developed to by-pass most DMD-causing mutations in the dystrophin gene transcript, in essence a form of <b>molecular</b> by-pass <b>surgery</b> allowing production of a protein of potentially near normal function. The distribution and complexity of dystrophin gene expression that posed great challenges for gene repair or replacement, may be regarded as positive attributes for induced exon skipping.

We investigated the effect of <b>molecular</b> cardiac <b>surgery</b> with recirculating delivery (MCARD) –mediated carboxyl-terminus of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARKct) gene transfer on cardiac mechanoenergetics and β-adrenoreceptor (βAR) signaling. MethodsAfter baseline measurements, sheep underwent MCARD-mediated delivery of 1014 genome copies of self-complimentary adeno-associated virus (scAAV 6) -βARKct. Four and 8 weeks after MCARD, mechanoenergetic studies using magnetic resonance imaging were performed. Tissues were analyzed with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blotting. βAR density, cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, and physiologic parameters were evaluated. ResultsThere was {{a significant increase in}} dP/dtmax at 4 weeks: 1384 ± 76 versus 1772 ± 182 mm Hg/s; and the increase persisted at 8 weeks in response to isoproterenol (P < . 05). Similarly, the magnitude of dP/dtmin increased at both 4 weeks and 8 weeks with isoproterenol stimulation (P < . 05). At 8 weeks, potential energy was conserved, whereas in controls there was a decrease in potential energy (P < . 05) in response to isoproterenol. RT-qPCR confirmed robustness of βARKct expression throughout the left ventricle and undetectable expression in extracardiac tissues. Quantitative Western blot data confirmed higher expression of βARKct in the left ventricle: 0. 46 ± 0. 05 versus 0. 00 in lung and liver (P < . 05). Survival was 100 % and laboratory parameters of major organ function were within normal limits.

MethodsIschemic cardiomyopathy was generated in a sheep model. The sheep were assigned to 1 of 2 groups: control (n =  10) and study (MCARD, n =  6). The control group underwent no intervention and the study group received 1014 genome copies of AAV 9 /SERCA 2 a 4 weeks after infarction. ResultsOur ischemic model produced reliable infarcts leading to heart failure.

At the time of distant relapse, biopsy was repeated for molecular characterization. The patient was treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor according to the detection of EGFR exon 21 mutation in metastatic sample and in one of the three lung tumors, characterized by lower mutated allele frequency. The progression free survival was three months according to radiological criteria and the treatment was provided for six months, until clinical progression. Following the assessment of EGFR mutations by pyrosequencing, tumor samples were analyzed by a 30 -gene next generation sequencing (NGS) panel, allowing to study intra-and inter-tumor heterogeneity and to confirm the three lung tumors as independent. Different molecular profiles of synchronous tumors and identical EGFR, PIK 3 CA and TP 53 mutations in one of three primary lung tumors and the metachronous metastasis were identified. In conclusion, morphological and molecular characterization of multiple lung nodules by NGS may help to define synchronous and metachronous adenocarcinomas, thus affecting surgical indication and systemic treatment. Intratumor heterogeneity may be associated with differential sensitivity to targeted treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} {{is a highly}} promising field of reconstructive biology that draws on recent advances in medicine, <b>surgery,</b> <b>molecular</b> and cellular biology, polymer chemistry, and physiology. The objective of using tissue engineering as therapeutic application has been to harness its ability to exploit selected and primed cells together with an appropriate mix of regulatory factors, to allow growth and specialization of cells and matrix. The authors reviewed controlled clinical trials which also included histological studies that evaluated the potential of tissue engineering as a clinical tool in regeneration. PubMed/MEDLINE databases were searched for studies {{up to and including}} June 2010 to identify appropriate articles. A comprehensive search was designed, and the articles were independently screened for eligibility. Articles with authentic controls and proper randomization and pertaining specifically to their role in periodontal regeneration were included. Studies demonstrated that the periodontal regeneration with the use of combination of tissue engineered products with an osteoconductive matrix improve the beneficial effect of these materials by accelerating cellular in growth and revascularization of the wound site. Studies have suggested the use of rh Platelet-derived growth factor + beta tricalcium phosphate for regeneration of the periodontal attachment apparatus in combination with collagen membranes as an acceptable alternative to connective tissue graft for covering gingival recession defects. The studies concluded that growth factors promote true regeneration of the periodontal attachment apparatus and the use of combination protein therapeutics which is commercially available can provide more predictable, faster, less invasive, less traumatic, and efficient outcome for the patient...|$|R
40|$|Background: Precision {{medicine}} is heralded as offering more effective treatments to smaller targeted patient populations. In breast cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy is standard for patients considered as high-risk after <b>surgery.</b> <b>Molecular</b> tests may identify patients who can safely avoid chemotherapy. Objectives: To use economic analysis before a large-scale clinical trial of molecular testing {{to confirm the}} value of the trial and help prioritize between candidate tests as randomized comparators. Methods: Women with surgically treated breast cancer (estrogen receptor–positive and lymph node–positive or tumor size ≥ 30 mm) were randomized to standard care (chemotherapy for all) or test-directed care using Oncotype DX™. Additional testing was undertaken using alternative tests: MammaPrintTM, PAM- 50 (ProsignaTM), MammaTyperTM, IHC 4, and IHC 4 -AQUA™ (NexCourse Breast™). A probabilistic decision model assessed the cost-effectiveness of all tests from a UK perspective. Value of information analysis determined the most efficient publicly funded ongoing trial design in the United Kingdom. Results: There was an 86 % probability of molecular testing being cost-effective, with most tests producing cost savings (range −£ 1892 to £ 195) and quality-adjusted life-year gains (range 0. 17 – 0. 20). There were only small differences in costs and quality-adjusted life-years between tests. Uncertainty was driven by long-term outcomes. Value of information demonstrated value of further research into all tests, with Prosigna currently being the highest priority for further research. Conclusions: Molecular tests are likely to be cost-effective, but an optimal test is yet to be identified. Health economics modeling to inform the design of a randomized controlled trial looking at diagnostic technology has been demonstrated to be feasible as a method for improving research efficiency...|$|R

The underlying biologic mechanisms are, however, far from established. A recently discovered mechanism has linked the enhanced conversion of kynurenine to kynurenic acid (KYNA) to an increased resilience toward stress-induced depression in mice. The {{aim of this study}} was to translate these findings to humans. Materials and methods: Kynurenine and KYNA levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography in plasma samples from 117 patients affected by mild-to-moderate depression before and within a week after a 12 -week training period at three different intensities. The patients were part of the Regassa study. Results: No differences in plasma levels of kynurenine and KYNA or in their ratio could be detected between before and after training. No effect of the intensity group could be observed. No correlation with the improvement in cardiovascular fitness (Åstrand score) or the improvement in mood (Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score) could be observed. Limitations: As the Regassa study is based on an intention-to-treat protocol, the exact time and the exact intensity of the physical exercise are not known. Analyses of pulse data as well as personal interviews, however, were used to control the exercise protocols. Furthermore, the observations reflect chronic changes. Conclusion: Physical exercise positively affects mood and cardiovascular fitness, but does not lead to long-lasting changes in plasma levels of kynurenine and KYNA in patients affected by mild-to-moderate depression.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE:Hypoxia in gliomas is {{associated}} with tumor resistance to radio- and chemotherapy. However, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of hypoxia remains challenging, and the validation of biological markers is, therefore, of great importance. We investigated the relationship between uptake of the PET hypoxia tracer [18 F]-FMISO and other markers of hypoxia and angiogenesis and with patient survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS:In this prospective single center clinical study, 33 glioma patients (grade IV: n[*]=[*] 24, III: n[*]=[*] 3, and II: n[*]=[*] 6) underwent [18 F]-FMISO PET and MRI including relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps before surgery. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) and hypoxic volume were calculated, defining two groups of patients based on {{the presence or absence}} of [18 F]-FMISO uptake. After <b>surgery,</b> <b>molecular</b> quantification of CAIX, VEGF, Ang 2 (rt-qPCR), and HIF- 1 α (immunohistochemistry) were performed on tumor specimens. RESULTS:[18 F]-FMISO PET uptake was closely linked to tumor grade, with high uptake in glioblastomas (GB, grade IV). Expression of biomarkers of hypoxia (CAIX, HIF- 1 α), and angiogenesis markers (VEGF, Ang 2, rCBV) were significantly higher in the [18 F]-FMISO uptake group. We found correlations between the degree of hypoxia (hypoxic volume and SUVmax) and expression of HIF- 1 α, CAIX, VEGF, Ang 2, and rCBV (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). Patients without [18 F]-FMISO uptake had a longer survival time than uptake positive patients (log-rank, p[*]<[*] 0. 005). CONCLUSIONS:Tumor hypoxia as evaluated by [18 F]-FMISO PET {{is associated}} with the expression of hypoxia markers on a molecular level and is related to angiogenesis. [18 F]-FMISO uptake is a mark of an aggressive tumor, almost always a glioblastoma. Our results underline that [18 F]-FMISO PET could be useful to guide glioma treatment, and in particular radiotherapy, since hypoxia is a well-known factor of resistance...|$|R

Current evidence supports {{the role of}} maximal safe surgical resection. In addition to open skull-base approaches, the endoscopic endonasal approach to clival chordomas has been reported with favorable albeit early results. Adjuvant radiation is prescribed following complete resection, alternatively for gross residual disease or {{at the time of}} recurrence. The modalities of adjuvant radiation therapy reported vary widely and include proton-beam, carbon-ion, fractionated photon radiotherapy, and photon and gamma-knife radiosurgery. As of now, no direct comparison is available, and high-level evidence demonstrating superiority of one modality over another is lacking. While systemic therapies have yet to form part of any first-line therapy for chordomas, a number of targeted agents have been evaluated to date that inhibit specific molecules and their respective pathways known to be implicated in chordomas. These include EGFR (erlotinib, gefitinib, lapatinib), PDGFR (imatinib), mTOR (rapamycin), and VEGF (bevacizumab). This article provides an update of the current multimodality treatment of cranial base chordomas, with an emphasis on how current understanding of molecular pathogenesis provides a framework for the development of novel targeted approaches.

GH therapy is prescribed for children with growth failure and adults with GH deficiency. Carefully conducted observational study of GH treatment affords the opportunity to assess long-term treatment outcomes and the clinical factors and variables affecting those outcomes, in patients receiving GH therapy in routine clinical practice. Design: The NordiNet® International Outcome Study (IOS) and the American Norditropin® Studies: Web Enabled Research (ANSWER Program®) are two complementary, non-interventional, observational studies that adhere to current guidelines for pharmacoepidemiological data. Patients: The studies include pediatric and adult patients receiving Norditropin®, as prescribed by their physicians. Measurements: The studies gather long-term data on the safety and effectiveness of real-life treatment with the recombinant human GH, Norditropin®. We describe the origins, aims, objectives, and design methodology of the studies, {{as well as their}} governance and validity, strengths, and limitations. Conclusion: The NordiNet® IOS and ANSWER Program® studies will provide valid insights into the effectiveness and safety of GH treatment across a diverse and large patient population treated in accordance with real-world clinical practice and following the Good Pharmacoepidemiological Practice and STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines.

The risk of cardiovascular disease is elevated among both men and women with T 2 D, however, the risk has declined among men over recent years while it remains stationary in women. Reasons for these sex differences remain unclear, and guidelines for diabetes treatment do not differentiate between sexes. Possible causes for varying outcome include differences in physiology, treatment response, and psychological factors. This review briefly outlines sex differences in hormonal pathophysiology, and thereafter summarizes the literature to date on sex differences in disease course and outcome. Methods: Systematic searches were performed on PubMed using “sex”, “gender”, and various glucose-lowering therapies as keywords. Earlier reviews are summarized and results from individual studies are reported. Reference lists from studies were used to augment the search. Results: There is an increased risk of missing the diagnosis of T 2 D when screening women with only fasting plasma glucose instead of with an oral glucose tolerance test. The impact of various risk factors for complications may differ by sex. Efficacy and side effects of some glucose-lowering drugs differ between men and women. Men with T 2 D appear to suffer more microvascular complications, while women have higher morbidity and mortality in cardiovascular disease and also fare worse psychologically. Conclusion: Few studies to date have focused on sex differences in T 2 D. Several questions demand further study, such as whether risk factors and treatment guidelines should be sex-specific. There is a need for clinical trials designed specifically to evaluate sex differences in efficacy and outcome of the available treatments.

The aim of this study was to compare women with a history of pHPT and a reference population in terms of standard factors predictive of prognosis and response to therapy for breast cancer. Methods: We analyzed data collected from the National Swedish Cancer Register and from two regional oncologic center registries. Seventy-one women with breast cancer and a history of parathyroid adenomectomy were compared with 338 matched controls with breast cancer only. Tumor size, stage, hormone receptor status, lymph node status, cause of death, and cumulative survival were analyzed. Results: The mean age was 69 &plusmn; 11 years (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 68 &ndash; 70) in both groups and the mean time interval between the parathyroid surgery and breast cancer diagnosis was 91 &plusmn; 68 months (95 % CI: 72 &ndash; 111). There were no differences between the two groups regarding size, stage, lymph node metastases, or survival, but none of the cases with a history of pHPT were found in Stage III or IV.

In this naturalistic study we investigated a sample of 809 antipsychotic-treated patients from Swedish psychosis outpatient teams. Cardiovascular risk factors (eg, metabolic syndrome, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and low-density lipoprotein values) were measured, and their associations to current antipsychotic pharmacotherapy were studied. Ten antipsychotic drugs were compared in a stepwise logistic regression model. For the patients, the presence of the components of metabolic syndrome ranged from 35 % for hyperglycemia to 64 % for elevated waist circumference. Hypertriglyceridemia was associated with clozapine (odds ratio [OR] = 1. 81, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 08 &ndash; 3. 04), reduced high-density lipoprotein with both clozapine and olanzapine (OR = 1. 73, 95 % CI 1. 01 &ndash; 2. 97; and OR = 2. 03, 95 % CI 1. 32 &ndash; 3. 13), hypertension with perphenazine (OR = 2. 00, 95 % CI 1. 21 &ndash; 3. 59), and hyperglycemia inversely with ziprasidone (OR = 0. 21, 95 % CI 0. 05 &ndash; 0. 89) and positively with haloperidol (OR = 2. 02, 95 % CI 1. 18 &ndash; 3. 48). There were no significant relationships between any of the antipsychotic drugs and increased waist circumference, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, or low-density lipoprotein levels. In conclusion, treatment with antipsychotic drugs is differentially associated with cardiovascular risk factors, even after adjusting for waist circumference, sex, age, and smoking.

This paper aims to describe the design and recruitment procedure in the COLOFOL trial, comparing demographic characteristics between randomized patients and eligible patients {{not included in the}} study. Materials and methods: COLOFOL was designed as a pragmatic trial with wide inclusion criteria and few exclusion criteria, in order to obtain a sample reflecting the general patient population. To be eligible, patients had to be 75 years or younger and curatively resected for stage II or III colorectal cancer. Exclusion criteria were hereditary colorectal cancer, no signed consent, other malignancy, and life expectancy less than 2 years due to concomitant disease. In four of the 24 participating centers, we scrutinized hospital inpatient data to identify all colorectal cancer patients who underwent surgery, in order to ascertain all eligible patients who {{were not included in the}} study and to compare them with enrolled patients. Results: Of a total of 4, 445 eligible patients, 2, 509 patients were randomized (56. 4 % inclusion rate). A total of 1, 221 eligible patients were identified in the scrutinized hospitals, of which 684 (56 %) were randomized. No difference in age or sex distribution was observed between randomized and nonrandomized eligible patients. However, a difference was noted in tumor location and stage distribution, with 5. 6 % more patients in the randomized group having colon cancer and 6. 7 % more patients having stage II disease. Conclusion: Patients in the two study arms were not only demographically similar, but also similar to nonincluded eligible patients, apart from stage and localization. The analyses will be stratified by these variables. Taken together, we conclude that our trial results will be robust and possible to extrapolate to the target population.
