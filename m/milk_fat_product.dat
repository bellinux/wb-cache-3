A total of 23 ingredients were tested in this experiment including six animal protein sources (blood meal, fish meal, meat meal, spray dried animal plasma, spray dried red blood cells and shrimp head flour), six oilseeds (extruded full-fat soybean, raw sunflower seeds, roasted sunflower seeds, caraway seeds, raw flaxseeds, and micronized flaxseeds), three oilseed meals (cottonseed meal, soybean meal, and borage meal), five wheat or wheat by-products (wheat, wheat distillers grains, wheat mill run, wheat bran, and dried wheat thin stillage) and three miscellaneous feeds (beet pulp, barley malt and milk-fat product). Nylon bags containing one gram of feed were placed in a 1000 mL beaker containing 500 mL of a solution made up of deionized water, 0. 01 N HCl and one gram of purified activated pepsin powder and incubated for 4 h at 37 ?C. The bags were then inserted into the duodenum of one of five pigs through simple T-cannulae. Eight bags were administered to each pig daily. The bags were inserted into the duodenal cannulae during feeding time with four bags being inserted {{in the morning and}} four bags being inserted during the afternoon meal. With each feeding, two bags were introduced 15 minutes apart. Between five and ten nylon bags were prepared for each feed and the experiment was conducted over a seven-day period. Overall, the MNBT produced similar results to previously published DE values for 11 out of the 17 ingredients for which previous measurements have been made. For the six feeds where there was a significant discrepancy between the MNBT and previously published values, variation in chemical content provided a reasonable explanation for the discrepancy. For untreated flaxseed, caraway seed, barley malt and beet pulp, the author believes that previously published values are too high for feedstuffs containing such high neutral detergent fibre contents. In the present experiment, the MNBT generated a DE value of 4253 kcal/kg for untreated flaxseed, 1763 kcal/kg for caraway seed, 1800 kcal/kg for barley malt and 1905 kcal/kg for beet pulp, For raw sunflower seed, genetic selection has increased the ether extract content of the seed and therefore the DE value obtained here (3830 kcal/kg) is thought to more closely reflect the DE content of sunflower seeds currently being grown. Only for meat meal, did the MNBT produce a suspect result (3433 kcal/kg), which cannot be readily explained. For the remaining six feeds, there are no previously published values with which to compare the DE values determined with the MNBT. Based on their chemical analysis and the generated DE values, shrimp head flour (3473 kcal/kg), dried wheat stillage (4291 kcal/kg), roasted sunflower seed (3903 kcal/kg), micronized flaxseed (4155 kcal/kg), and <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> <b>product</b> (8004 kcal/kg) all appear to have some potential for use as ingredients in swine rations. In contrast, borage meal (1562 kcal/kg) {{does not appear to be}} a useful ingredient. The overall results of this experiment indicate that the MNBT has considerable potential for use in determining the digestible energy content of swine feeds. The MNBT has several advantages compared with conventional digestibility methods in that many feeds can be tested in a relatively short duration of time with significantly fewer animals being used, only small amounts of feed are required and the test allows for energy measurements in feedstuffs that would not normally be fed to pigs as a single ingredient. ]]...|$|E

40|$|Until recently, {{the role}} of socio-regional context as a {{determinant}} of adolescents' health behaviour has been largely neglected in health studies. Usually {{the focus is on}} characteristics of individuals, while the potentially equally strong effect of the context is left unanalysed. Using multi-level data we studied whether socio-regional context influences health behaviour and whether it modifies differences by socio-economic background of adolescents. The individual level data derive from the (Finnish) Adolescent Health and Lifestyle Survey. In the survey, nationally representative data of 16 - and 18 -year old Finns were collected in 1991 and 1993 by mailed questionnaires (total n = 9121, response rate = 76 %). These data were linked with a database that included socio-economic characteristics of municipalities. Three dimensions of the socio-regional context were measured: level of services, occupational structure and self-sufficiency of employment. In a series of logistic regression models, factors related to daily smoking, weekly alcohol use, use of high <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> <b>products</b> and frequent physical activity were analysed. Socio-economic background of the adolescent was a strong determinant of all four health behaviours. Drinking and use of high <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> <b>products</b> were, however, also related to the socio-regional context. The relationship between socio-regional context and these behaviours was dissimilar, so that the dimensions of the socio-regional context that were related to the behaviours were different among boys than among girls. Our study shows that socio-regional context associates with adolescents' alcohol use and use of high <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> <b>products,</b> while the more detailed nature of this relationship remains unclear. contextual analysis adolescents health behaviour socio-economic differences...|$|R

In this paper, the molecular species of TAGs of equine milk were identified {{using a combination of}} non-aqueous reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and high temperature gas chromatography and were then compared to the TAGs {{composition of}} human milk. The data showed that equine milk contained a complex mixture of different TAGs molecular species resulting from the widest range of its fatty acids as compared to human milk. In particular, the largest differences in TAGs composition between equine and human milk concerned TAGs containing medium-chain fatty acids; for C(8), C(10), and C(12). In terms of carbon number (CN), TAGs with CN 36 -CN 46 were the most abundant in equine milk with a maximum concentration at CN 44 (15. 3 %), while TAGs with CN 44 -CN 52 were the predominant in human milk with a maximum of CN 52 (30 %). For both milks studied, the experimentally determined distributions of TAGs molecular species deviated from those predicted by the random hypothesis. TAGs with CN 44 corresponding to a fatty acids carbon number distribution of C(8) /C(18) /C(18), C(12) /C(14) /C(18), and C(10) /C(16) /C(18) were apparently preferentially synthesized in equine milk.

However, dairy processes modify the supramolecular structure and the surface composition of <b>milk</b> <b>fat.</b> Thus, <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> is present in many dairy products under various forms. In this study, we focused {{on the fact that}} natural <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> globules are rarely consumed in their native state, i. e. in fresh raw milk. In most drinking <b>milks,</b> <b>fat</b> globules are homogenised in order to avoid their rising at the surface of the <b>products.</b> Furthermore, <b>fat</b> globules are heat treated to avoid the growth of micro-organisms. As a consequence of the technological process applied, the volume-weighted average diameter of fat globules in drinking milks is in the range 0. 2 - 0. 5 µm. Homogenisation of fat globules led to the partial disruption of the MFGM and to the adsorption of milk proteins. Moreover, this study showed that in cheeses, <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> can be dispersed as (i) fat globules with the MFGM, (ii) aggregates of fat globules, (ii) homogenised fat globules, (iii) free fat and (iv) a combination of different phases and structures.

40|$|Abstract. Our {{objective}} was to evaluation milk yield, milk components, and especially fatty acid profile of <b>milk</b> <b>fat,</b> in relation with stage of lactation. Sheep were kept indoor and were fed the same diet, which consisted of hay, corn silage and concentrate mix. Individual milk yields were recorded weekly over a two-month period. Effect of lactation stage was determined in weeks 2, 6, 10 and 14 after weaning of lambs. TU ewes yielded more milk, with a higher content of fat and protein, and <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> had a lower content of saturated FA (C 10 : 0, C 12 : 0, C 14 : 0) and a higher content of polyunsaturated FA, so that atherogenic index (AI) recorded the best value for this breed. We observed {{a strong correlation between}} <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> trans-vaccenic acid (trans- 11 C 18 : 1 -VA) and cis- 9, trans- 11 CLA on the one hand, and between cis- 9, trans- 11 CLA and ∆ 9 desaturase system on the other hand. Tzurcana breed also had the highest concentration of c 9,t 11 -CLA in milk, which was due not only to an increase of VA supply in the rumen, but also to an increase in ∆ 9 desaturase enzyme activity. Milk n- 3 FA content, mainly that in α-linolenic acid (ALA) was not influenced by breed. As lactation progressed, milk fatty acid profile changed in a positive way, as saturated FA content and the AI value decreased gradually, while ALA and c 9,t 11 -CLA content increased. Use of Tzurcana breed for milk production or in breeding programs can be a way to improve <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> and dairy <b>product</b> FA profile...|$|R

A prototype was developed that uses two, gallon-size milk jugs, each attached to a flexible tube at the cap interface. The flexible tubes passes through a ratio selection mechanism that the user can rotate to select the desired type of milk. The mechanism compresses the tubes to achieve the appropriate ratio, and finally the tubes pass on through to a dispensing valve.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} interest {{in recent years}} in altering the fatty acid composition of <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> in dairy <b>products</b> to improve the long-term health of consumers. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the influence of altering the fatty acid composition and varying two process parameters (homogenization pressure and ageing temperature) on the quality of ice cream. The quality of ice cream (8 % fat) was monitored before and after heat shock by assessing fat droplet size, solvent extractable fat content, texture analysis, meltdown tests and sensory analyses. The results suggest that a high solid fat content and low homogenization pressure correlated well with large particles and high amounts of solvent extractable fat, which resulted in firm ice cream with slow melting behaviour and good structure retention. In contrast, ageing temperature did not significantly influence fat destabilization. Following heat shock, the results suggested that the hardness of ice cream was not determined by any of the parameters investigated, but was probably dominated by the amount of ice crystals. A good melting behaviour was retained after heat shock, provided that a strong matrix of destabilized fat was produced during the freezing process. Even though differences could be observed in hardness and melting behaviour for different <b>milk</b> <b>fats</b> or process conditions, these differences were hardly identified by trained sensory panels. These results suggest that high-quality ice cream can be produced with an altered fatty acid composition without any alteration in the conventional production process, provided that ice cream is stored and consumed under ideal circumstances...|$|R

The cows were grazing fresh pasture, and in addition one of the pair was provided with a daily supplement of encapsulated sunflower oil. The <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> of the cow given the supplement (18 : 2 -rich <b>milk</b> <b>fat)</b> contained 15. 5 % 18 : 2 compared with 1. 8 % 18 : 2 in the <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> of the other cow (control <b>milk</b> <b>fat).</b> This increase in the proportion of 18 : 2 in the <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> was accompanied by decreases in the proportions of myristic acid (14 : 0) and palmitic acid (16 : 0). The effect of this altered fatty acid (FA) composition on the TG composition of the 18 : 2 -rich <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> was to increase the proportions of TGs with 40, 52 and 54 acyl carbons and to decrease the proportions of TGs with 34, 36, 38, 44, 46, 48 and 50 acyl carbons relative to the proportions in the control <b>milk</b> <b>fat.</b> Both <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> samples were separated, by column chromatography on silicic acid, into TG fractions of high, medium and low molecular weight. The relative proportions of the TG fractions of high, medium and low mol. wt. in the 18 : 2 -rich <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> were 43. 0, 19. 5 and 37. 5 % respectively compared with 36. 1, 19. 7 end 44. 2 % respectively in the control <b>milk</b> <b>fat.</b> Stereospecific analysis of these triacylglycerol fractions demonstrated that in fractions of similar mol. wt., the distribution of fatty acids within the TG molecule in the presence of high levels of 18 : 2, was not appreciably altered from that in the triacylglycerol fractions of the control <b>milk</b> <b>fat.</b> The positional distribution of fatty acids in the triacylglycerols of the total <b>milk,</b> <b>fats</b> was also similar. In the <b>milk</b> <b>fat,</b> containing high levels of linoleic acid, 18 : 2 showed a preference for positions 1 and 2 in the triacylglycerols of the low and medium mol. wt. fractions, and for positions 2 and 3 of the high mol. wt. fraction. The three TG fractions of each <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> were further resolved into TG classes of differing levels of unsaturation. The 18 : 2 -rich <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> contained higier levels of the unsaturated TGs, namely the diene, triene and tetraene TGs, and lower levels of the saturated TGs {{and to a lesser extent}} the monoene TGs.

The CAFA diet increased lactation performance when fed beginning at 45 ± 24 days in milk (DIM), however, the SFA diet resulted in an increase in milk protein yield with cows when fed beginning at 73 ± 41 DIM. In the third study, ruminally inert <b>fat</b> <b>products</b> of either CAFA rich in C 16 : 0 and C 18 : 1, or SFA rich in C 16 : 0 and C 18 : 0 were fed to multiparious dairy cows starting at 14 ± 2 DIM.

Normal values for <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> range from 3. 7 percent (Holstein) to 4. 9 percent (Jersey); milk protein ranges from 3. 1 percent (Holstein) to 3. 8 percent (Jersey). Lactose is usually 4. 6 – 4. 8 percent for all breeds; minerals (ash) average. 74 percent. Because current milk pricing formulas emphasize <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> and protein, maintaining <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> and protein tests provides an economic advantage. Normal <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> percentages also reflect good rumen and cow health. Generally, diets which cause low <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> test also cause sore feet (laminitis), acidosis and feed intake problems. Milk protein has economic value because higher protein leads to higher cheese yields. Increasingly, milk protein content is being emphasized...|$|R
40|$|<b>Milk</b> <b>fat</b> was interesterified with {{oleic acid}} by {{catalysis}} of an immobilized lipase in a microaqueous two-phase system. A commercial lipase from Rhizopus oryzae and a controlled pore glass carrier {{were selected for}} preparation of an immobilized lipase. The prepared immobilized lipase showed a Michaelis constant of 77 mM and a maximum velocity of 40 U/g of carrier on the hydrolysis of triolein. Conditions for interesterification catalyzed by the immobilized lipase were optimized by the reaction between trimyristin and oleic acid under various conditions. The interesterification of <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> with oleic acid was performed in isooctane with. 3 % (vol/vol) water content. The fatty acid composition and thermal characteristics of the triglycerides of the interesterified <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> were investigated. The interesterified <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> had about 50 % more oleic acid and a significantly lower palmitic acid content {{than those of the}} original <b>milk</b> <b>fat.</b> The crystallization and melting curves obtained by differential scanning calorimetry analysis showed that the transition temperature of the major <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> peaks decreased by 7. 6 and 5. 4 -degrees-C, respectively. The results suggest that the prepared immobilized lipase can induce rather specific interesterification between oleic acid and palmitic acid in the <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> triglycerides, which produces a lower melting <b>milk</b> <b>fat,</b> without losses of the short-chain fatty acid composition...|$|R
30|$|In {{comparison}} with milk production, the variation of <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> content is relatively small. Thus, the <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> ratio resembles the reciprocal of milk production, {{as shown in}} Equation (1). This fact vindicates an empirical finding by Wood (1976). Of course, there is a variety of choices of which indicator to use for management, and it is absolutely the farm’s choice. If the <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> ratio tends to be preferable, the six different scenarios leading to {{a variation of the}} <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> ratio provide useful indications for management planning strategies. Although management actions to reduce the negative effects of heat cannot be applied to each individual within a large production system (André et al. 2011), our present analysis highlights only six different required treatment strategies. Further, these may be reduced to the three major cases shown in Figure 3. Appropriate management action can be taken regarding feed composition and the prioritised allocation of cows in the barn. For Case 2, in which the production of <b>milk</b> and <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> increase, no special treatment is actually required despite a decrease in the <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> ratio. The reason for this is the faster increase of milk production compared to that of <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> yield. For Case 5, cows are strongly affected by heat, but the <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> ratio increases. The decreased production of <b>milk</b> and <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> may be offset by allocating the cows as cool a space as possible and providing them with easily digestible and high-calorie feed. For Case 1, the decreased production of <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> may be offset by providing cows with a fat-productive feed.|$|R
30|$|Our {{analysis}} {{has suggested that}} the <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> ratio is dependent upon and driven by the variation of <b>milk</b> and <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> production according to heat. We have identified six distinct scenarios that underpin an increase or a decrease in the <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> ratio. Our results indicate that efficient managing strategies are required for each group; varying the feed composition may be effective.|$|R

40|$|<b>Milk</b> <b>fat</b> has a {{very rich}} {{chemical}} composition and unique organoleptic properties. It is the only relevant natural source of short-chain fatty acids (C 4 to C 10), which have been associated to several health effects. <b>Milk</b> <b>fat</b> also contains a series of minor, bioactive lipids with anticarcinogenic, antidepressant and bactericidal activity. In the last decades, however, the consumption of <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> in developed countries has decreased gradually, mainly due to its relatively high price compared to margarines and a negatively perceived health image, derived from its content of cholesterol and saturated fatty acids. Consequences of the consumption decline are the accumulation of <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> stocks, which leads to instability in the dairy sector. A promising strategy for the revalorization of <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> encompasses a more effective use of both its major and minor components. The aim of this thesis was to conceive and develop novel routes for the synthesis of added-value derivatives from <b>milk</b> <b>fat,</b> focusing {{on the use of}} the major components of <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> (fatty acids) and on the preservation of its natural characteristics (flavor, aroma, texture).

40|$|The aim of {{this field}} study was to {{investigate}} whether the incidence of cystic ovarian disease (COD) in dairy cows was related to milk production parameters (<b>milk</b> yield, <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> and protein) in early lactation with special emphasis on the negative energy balance (NEB). The diagnosis of COD was made by rectal palpation performed by veterinarians experienced in gynaecology. Data used for this field study were collected from November 1986 onwards. The dataset consisted of 6911 lactations (3891 cows) on 29 herds including 600 cases of COD (8. 7 %). Lactations in the COD group had higher average maximum productions of milk, energy corrected <b>milk,</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> and protein than lactations in the non-COD group. The average maximum milk fat:protein ratio did not significantly differ between the groups. Daily changes of the average maximum <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> and protein percentage and of total <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> and protein yield were calculated and divided into four groups depending on the day of first milk recording. No significant relations were found between changes in <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> and protein percentage and total <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> and protein yield, and the incidence of COD. It is concluded that elevated average peak <b>milk</b> yield, <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> and protein yield in early lactation are risk factors for the incidence of COD, but the average milk fat:protein ratio is not. In this field study changes in <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> percentage and <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> yield, indicative for the presence of NEB, did not show a relation with the incidence of COD in early lactating cows.

Furthermore, pulsed {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} measurements also showed that addition of milk phospholipid to anhydrous <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> delays crystallisation, since the increase in solid fat content was slower at isothermal crystallisation at 22 degrees C.

The control sample started crystallizing in double lamellar structure of 46. 3 angstrom followed by triple lamellar structure of 36. 5 angstrom and 72. 9 angstrom while the double lamellar structure of 46. 3 angstrom was not present in <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> added phospholipid.
