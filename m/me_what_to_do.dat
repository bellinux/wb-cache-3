500|$|Shaughnessy did {{not take}} {{criticism}} well. In one incident, he demanded that a critical columnist leave a Northern California Football Writers' Association meeting. During a 1945 press conference while coach at Pittsburgh, Shaughnessy responded to criticism {{that he had been}} too conservative in a 6–0 win over [...] and taken too many risks in a 39–9 loss to Notre Dame. He said, [...] "You tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Shall we play a conservative game—hold down the score and play to look good—or shall we gamble, depending on a freak chance to win but losing by a big score if we fail?" ...|$|E
500|$|With the {{new season}} of the J.League commencing in March 1995, Wenger set about {{assembling}} his squad and backroom staff. He hired former Valenciennes manager Boro Primorac, whom he had befriended during the match-fixing scandal, as his assistant. Alexandre Torres joined Nagoya after Wenger identified the defender by watching Brazilian football on the television, and the manager brought in Franck Durix and his former player Passi. Nagoya finished bottom of the J.League the season before Wenger's arrival, and continued their poor form into the following campaign, losing several matches in a row. In response to the situation, Wenger altered his managerial style, becoming less amicable with his players and openly questioning their desire. To boost morale, he took his squad to Versailles for their mid-season break, where they went through a rigorous, but creative, training regime. Players were expected to make decisions for themselves on the pitch, instead of relying on the manager; Wenger {{was reported to have}} shouted to his players [...] "Don't look at me to ask <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the ball!" [...] and [...] "Decide for yourself! Why don't you think it out?" [...] One player who greatly benefited from Wenger's guidance was Dragan Stojković, a midfielder whose disciplinary record improved considerably.|$|E
500|$|The {{first half}} of Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was {{recorded}} shortly {{after the completion of}} Blood Sugar Sex Magik; the second half between late 1991 and early 1992, during the album's tour. [...] "Running Away Into You" [...] is the only track recorded after he left the Chili Peppers. The album is a heavily experimental avant-garde composition whose initial purpose was spiritual and emotional expression: [...] "I wrote [...] because I was in a really big place in my head—it was a huge, spiritual place telling <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> As long as I'm obeying those forces, it's always going to be meaningful. I could be playing guitar and I could say 'Play something that sucks,' and if I'm in that place, it's gonna be great. And {{it has nothing to do}} with me, except in ways that can't be understood." [...] Frusciante further asserted that the album was meant to be experienced as a cohesive unit rather than separate entities or songs. Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was released on Rick Rubin's label American Recordings. Warner Bros., the Chili Peppers' label, owned rights to the album because of the leaving-artist clause in Frusciante's Chili Peppers contract. However, because he was reclusive, the label gladly handed the rights over to Rubin, who released the album at the urging of Frusciante's friends.|$|E

500|$|Unhappy {{with the}} quality of 1980's Live at Last, the band {{recorded}} another live album—titled Live Evil—during the Mob Rules world tour, across the United States in Dallas, San Antonio, and Seattle, in 1982. During the mixing process for the album, Iommi and Butler had a falling out with Dio. Misinformed by their then-current mixing engineer, Iommi and Butler accused Dio of sneaking into the studio at night to raise the volume of his vocals. In addition, Dio was not satisfied with the pictures of him in the artwork. Butler also accused Dio and Appice of working on a solo album during the album's mixing without telling the other members of Black Sabbath. [...] "Ronnie wanted more say in things," [...] Iommi said. [...] "And Geezer would get upset with him and that is where the rot set in. Live Evil is when it all fell apart. Ronnie wanted to do more of his own thing, and the engineer we were using at the time in the studio didn't know what to do, because Ronnie was telling him one thing and we were telling him another. At the end of the day, we just said, 'That's it, the band is over'". [...] "When it comes time for the vocal, nobody tells <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Nobody! Because they're not as good as me, so I do what I want to do," [...] Dio later said. [...] "I refuse to listen to Live Evil, because there are too many problems. If you look at the credits, the vocals and drums are listed off to the side. Open up the album and see how many pictures there are of Tony, and how many there are of me and Vinny".|$|E

And at 19, you think you rule the world, and you can control things. And a lot of times, you don't.|$|E
2500|$|Garbo never married, had no children, {{and lived}} alone as an adult. Her most famous romance {{was with her}} {{frequent}} co-star, John Gilbert, with whom she lived intermittently in 1926 and 1927. Soon after their romance began, Gilbert began helping her acting on the set, teaching her how to behave like a star, how to socialize at parties, and {{how to deal with}} studio bosses. They costarred again in three more hits, Love (1927), A Woman of Affairs (1928), and Queen Christina (1933). Gilbert allegedly proposed to her numerous times, with Garbo agreeing but backing out at the last minute. [...] "I was in love with him," [...] she said. [...] "But I froze. I was afraid he would tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and boss me. I always wanted to be the boss." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2010 Gauci formed Tune in Tokyo, an electro-pop {{and dance}} music band, with {{producer}} Paul Brandoli. As the group's lead singer, Gauci's look and sound had changed. She told the Daily Telegraph {{that she had}} changed her style after hanging out in Melbourne's gay dance clubs with musician, and her then-husband, Hamish Cowan (Cordrazine). Gauci explained, [...] "That's where I {{came out of my}} shell. I didn't have anyone telling <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Tune in Tokyo is just one part of what I want to do. We got a lot of feedback straight away, which was great because it gave me confidence about the project". On 4 November 2010 they released their debut single, [...] "Dreamer", which peaked at No.3 on the ARIA Clubs Chart. It was co-written by Brandoli and Gauci. She revealed that she was working on the group's debut album and that she had made a cameo for a 2011 film, Big Mamma's Boy, which stars actress, Holly Valance. Tune in Tokyo's second single, [...] "Ray of Love", appeared in April 2012.|$|E
