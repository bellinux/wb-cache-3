5|$|Another {{factor was}} the weather within the {{operational}} theater. The cyclical monsoon patterns {{meant that the}} weather was deplorable for flight operations eight {{months of the year}} (from late September to early May) when rain and fog tended to conceal targets. Lack of adequate all-weather and night-bombing capability made it necessary for the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> missions to be conducted during daylight hours, thereby easing the burden on the air defense forces of North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Exit {{numbers were}} {{originally}} sequential but are assigned today by mileage from south to east, the same numbering system {{used by the}} <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> states for their Interstate Highways as well. After passing the Bonner Springs interchange, exit numbers change to match the mileage of Interstate 70 (I-70) east from the Colorado border, which is also used on I-70 west of the turnpike. This results in discontinuous exit numbers on I-70.|$|E

25|$|The {{percentage}} of the population that utilizes chiropractic care at any given time generally falls into a range from 6% to 12% in the U.S. and Canada, with a global high of 20% in Alberta in 2006. In 2008, chiropractors were reported to be the most common CAM providers for children and adolescents, consuming up to 14% of all visits to chiropractors. In 2008, there were around 60,000 chiropractors practicing in North America. In 2002–03, the majority of those who sought chiropractic did so for relief from back and neck pain and other neuromusculoskeletal complaints; most do so specifically for low back pain. The <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> chiropractors participate in some form of managed care. Although the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> chiropractors view themselves as specialists in neuroleptic malignant syndrome conditions, many also consider chiropractic as a type of primary care. In the majority of cases, the care that chiropractors and physicians provide divides the market, however for some, their care is complementary.|$|E

In 2012 Save the Children examined maternity leave laws, ranking 36 industrialized countries according to their support for breastfeeding. Norway ranked first, while the United States came in last.

25|$|The first A-29 Super Tucano of the Pentagon's Light Air Support (LAS) program, {{destined for}} the Afghan Air Force, has been {{delivered}} to the US Air Force in Jacksonville, Florida by the Sierra Nevada Corporation and Embraer in September 2014. The LAS contract {{was developed by the}} Pentagon to supply Afghanistan’s military with 20 planes, which should ensure air superiority in the country after the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>US</b> forces leave. Because the contract is a foreign military sale, Nevada-based SNC and Brazil-based Embraer deliver the planes to the Air Force, which then passes them on to the Afghan military. The first of 20 A-29 Super Tucano aircraft arrived at Moody Air Force Base on September 26, 2014 in preparation for the Afghanistan pilot and maintenance training mission.|$|E
25|$|Between 1940 and 1996, the U.S. {{government}} {{spent at}} least $ in present-day terms on nuclear weapons, including platforms development (aircraft, rockets and facilities), command and control, maintenance, waste management and administrative costs. It is estimated that, since 1945, the United States produced more than 70,000 nuclear warheads, {{which is more than}} all other nuclear weapon states combined. The Soviet Union/Russia has produced approximately 55,000 nuclear warheads since 1949, France built 1,110 warheads since 1960, the United Kingdom built 835 warheads since 1952, China built about 600 warheads since 1964, and other nuclear powers built fewer than 500 warheads all together since they developed their first nuclear weapons. Until November 1962, the vast <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> nuclear tests were above ground. After the acceptance of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, all testing was relegated underground, in order to prevent the dispersion of nuclear fallout.|$|E

25|$|The <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> adults self-identify as Christians, while {{close to}} a quarter claim no {{religious}} affiliation. According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 70.6% {{of the adult population}} identified themselves as Christians, with 46.5% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant, and 20.8% professing Catholic beliefs. The same study says that other religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam) collectively make up about 6% of the population. According to a 2012 survey by the Pew forum, 36% of U.S. adults state that they attend services nearly every week or more. According to a 2016 Gallup poll, Mississippi (with 63% of its adult population described as very religious, saying that religion is important to them and attending religious services almost every week) is the most religious state in the country, while New Hampshire (with only 20% of its adult population described as very religious) is the least religious state.|$|E
25|$|During the 2008 presidential election, Obama {{strongly}} {{criticized the}} Iraq War, and Obama withdrew the vast <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> soldiers in Iraq by late 2011. On taking office, Obama announced that U.S. combat forces would leave Iraq by August 2010, with 35,000–50,000 American soldiers remaining in Iraq as advisers and trainers, {{down from the}} roughly 150,000 American soldiers in Iraq in early 2009. In 2008, President Bush had signed the U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement, in which the United States committed to withdrawing all forces by late 2011. Obama attempted to convince Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to allow U.S. soldiers to stay past 2011, but the large presence of American soldiers was unpopular with most Iraqis. By late-December 2011, only 150 American soldiers remained to serve at the US embassy. However, in 2014, the U.S. began a campaign against ISIL, an Islamic extremist terrorist group operating in Iraq and Syria that grew dramatically after the withdrawal of U.S. soldiers from Iraq {{and the start of}} the Syrian Civil War. By June 2015, there were about 3500 American soldiers in Iraq serving as advisers to anti-ISIL forces in the Iraqi Civil War, and Obama left office with roughly 5,262 U.S. soldiers in Iraq and 503 of them in Syria.|$|E

500|$|UVA's student {{newspaper}} The Cavalier Daily described mixed reactions {{from the student}} body, stating: [...] "For some, the piece is an unfounded attack on our school; for others, it is a recognition of a harsh reality; and for what I suspect is a large <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> it falls somewhere in between." [...] Cavalier columnist Dani Bernstein rejected Erdely's portrayal of UVA's student body as sharing equal blame with the administration. Bernstein also said that regardless of its veracity, the Rolling Stone article underscored preexisting and recurrent complaints about the school's inadequate handling of sexual assault and their [...] "deference to Greek life". She argued that [...] "the school has been unbelievably slow to investigate Phi Kappa Psi despite many allegations of sexual assault".|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Bowers was {{formally}} overruled by Lawrence v. Texas, from which Scalia dissented. According to Mark V. Tushnet in his {{survey of the}} Rehnquist Court, during the oral argument in the case, Scalia seemed so intent on making the state's argument for it that the Chief Justice intervened. According to his biographer, Joan Biskupic, Scalia [...] "ridiculed" [...] the majority in his dissent for being so ready to cast aside Bowers when {{many of the same}} justices had refused to overturn Roe in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In March 2009, openly gay Congressman Barney Frank described him as a [...] "homophobe". Maureen Dowd described Scalia in a 2003 column as [...] "Archie Bunker in a high-backed chair". In an op-ed for The New York Times, federal appeals judge Richard Posner and Georgia State University law professor Eric Segall described as radical Scalia's positions on homosexuality, reflecting an apparent belief that the religious stances supposedly held by the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>US</b> citizens should take precedence over the Constitution and characterizing Scalia's [...] "political ideal as verg on majoritarian theocracy".|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, those {{voting on}} the bill were later {{surprised}} by the reaction it gained.

The <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> just voted for it because {{we thought we could}} try to fix the problem. Nobody envisioned boycotts. Nobody anticipated the emotion, the prayer vigils. The attitude was: These are the laws, let's start following them." [...] State Representative Kyrsten Sinema, the assistant House minority leader who tried to stop the bill and voted against it, similarly reflected: [...] "I knew it would be bad, but no one thought it would be this big. No one." ...|$|E
