5|$|The Atari {{video game}} burial was a mass burial of unsold video game cartridges, consoles, and {{computers}} in a New Mexico landfill site, undertaken by American video game and home computer company Atari, Inc. in 1983.

5|$|The first trade dollars {{were struck}} in 1873, and the {{majority}} of the coins were sent to China. Eventually, bullion producers began converting large amounts of silver into trade dollars, causing the coins to make their way into American commercial channels. This caused frustration among those to whom they were given in payment, as the coins were largely <b>maligned</b> and traded for less than one dollar each. In response to their wide distribution in American commerce, the coins were officially demonetized in 1876, but continued to circulate. Production of business strikes ended in 1878, though the mintage of proof coins officially continued until 1883. The trade dollar was re-monetized when the Coinage Act of 1965 was signed into law.|$|E
5|$|Three {{different}} early {{versions of}} the play are extant: the First Quarto (Q1, 1603); the Second Quarto (Q2, 1604); and the First Folio (F1, 1623). Each version includes lines and entire scenes missing from the others. The play's structure and depth of characterisation have inspired much critical scrutiny. One such example is the centuries-old debate about Hamlet's hesitation to kill his uncle, which some see as merely a plot device to prolong the action, but which others argue is a dramatisation of the complex philosophical and ethical issues that surround cold-blooded murder, calculated revenge, and thwarted desire. More recently, psychoanalytic critics have examined Hamlet's unconscious desires, while feminist critics have re-evaluated and attempted to rehabilitate the often <b>maligned</b> characters of Ophelia and Gertrude.|$|E
5|$|Calvin's {{theology}} caused controversy. Pierre Caroli, a Protestant {{minister in}} Lausanne accused Calvin {{as well as}} Viret and Farel of Arianism in 1536. Calvin defended his beliefs on the Trinity in Confessio de Trinitate propter calumnias P. Caroli. In 1551 Jérôme-Hermès Bolsec, a physician in Geneva, attacked Calvin's doctrine of predestination and accused him of making God the author of sin. Bolsec was banished from the city, and after Calvin's death, he wrote a biography which severely <b>maligned</b> Calvin's character. In the following year, Joachim Westphal, a Gnesio-Lutheran pastor in Hamburg, condemned Calvin and Zwingli as heretics in denying the eucharistic doctrine of the union of Christ's body with the elements. Calvin's Defensio sanae et orthodoxae doctrinae de sacramentis (A Defence of the Sober and Orthodox Doctrine of the Sacrament) was his response in 1555. In 1556 , a Dutch dissident, held a public disputation with Calvin {{during his visit to}} Frankfurt, in which Velsius defended free will against Calvin's doctrine of predestination. Following the execution of Servetus, a close associate of Calvin, Sebastian Castellio, broke with him {{on the issue of the}} treatment of heretics. In Castellio's Treatise on Heretics (1554), he argued for a focus on Christ's moral teachings in place of the vanity of theology, and he afterward developed a theory of tolerance based on biblical principles.|$|E

40|$|Aim: Benign and {{especially}} <b>malign</b> and premalign lesions of vulva are relatively infrequent in gyneocologic system lesions. Because of its infrequency we aimed {{to review and}} classify archival material of this area and discuss some diagnostically important and some rarely seen cases under the light of literature. Methods and Results:We reviewed archival material of 94 cases in Zeynep Kamil Hospital Pathology Laboratory. Hematoxylin-Eosin(HE) sections and if needed immunohistochemically stained sections of the cases have been re-examined. There were 15 cases of <b>malign</b> tumors, 57 cases of benign tumors and 22 cases of premalign lesions. Of <b>malign</b> tumors; 9 cases were squamous carcinoma, 4 cases were <b>malign</b> melanoma, 1 case was basal cell carcinoma and 1 case was PNET/EwingConclusion: Since the vulvar lesions are infrequently seen lesions {{and some of them}} are like differentiated VIN, really hard to diagnosis, there may be need further studies involving a large number of case...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The <b>malign</b> lesions {{of stomach}} may be ulcerative. Today, the {{follow-up}} periods {{for patients with}} gastric ulcer (GU) has not been clearly defined. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the significance of ulcer size and location in differential diagnosis of GUs at endoscopy. Materials and methods: Data were retrospectively collected from the records of gastrointestinal endoscopy unit and pathology laboratory of our hospital between August 2008 and October 2010. We evaluated the demographic, endoscopic and histopathological features of the patients with GU. ROC curve analysis was performed for determining cut-off diameter differing <b>malign</b> ulcer from benign ulcer during gastroscopy. Results: A total of 161 patients (81 males, 80 females) with gastric ulcer were included. Twenty-seven patients had <b>malign</b> ulcer and 134 had benign ulcer. Mean ages of groups of <b>malign</b> and benign ulcer were 66. 4 ± 13. 8 and 56. 7 ± 17 years, respectively (p< 0. 05). Ulcer locations were angulus and antrum in 48 % of the patients with <b>malign</b> ulcer and in 86 % of with benign ulcer. Mean ulcer diameters were 21. 1 ± 12. 4 mm and 8. 3 ± 6. 2 mm, for <b>malign</b> and benign ulcers respectively (p< 0. 05). Cut-off diameter of gastric ulcers for differing <b>malign</b> from benign was 11 mm. Sensitivity and specifity of this value was 88. 9 % and 88. 8 %, respectively. Conclusions: Although, the site of the ulcer cannot be taken as indicative of its nature, ulcer size may help for predicting ulcer nature. Malignant ulcers tended to be larger (≥ 11 mm). The repetition of endoscopy may be delayed until the end of treatment in small ulcers (< 11 cm). J Clin Exp Invest 2011; 2 (3) : 273 - 276...|$|R

Experiments are conducted to quantitatively determine normal tissues characterization. In the first experiment, hyperspectral images are acquired from normal lung tissue phantom and analyzed. The data shows obvious peak absorption intensity at four different near infrared wavelengths (760, 805, 905, and 970 nm). In the second experiment, the simulated <b>malign</b> lung tissue phantom is {{used to compare the}} spectrum between normal and <b>malign</b> tissues.
