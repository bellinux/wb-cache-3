It is assumed that such <b>mesh</b> <b>architectures</b> employ cut-through or worm-hole routing. The main results are an algorithm for performing an optimal minimum-spanning tree broadcast when messages are not pipelined, a pipelined algorithm that is similar to Ho and Johnson's EDST algorithm for hypercubes, and a novel scatter-collect approach that is a natural choice for communication libraries due to its simplicity. Results obtained on the Intel Touchstone Delta system are included. 1 Introduction In this paper, we discuss the design of general purpose broadcast routines for <b>mesh</b> <b>architectures</b> like the Symult S 2010, and the Intel Touchstone Delta and Paragon systems.

40|$|<b>Mesh</b> <b>architectures</b> {{are used}} to {{distribute}} critical global signals on a chip, such as clock and power/ground. Redundancy created by mesh loops smooths out undesirable variations between signal nodes spatially distributed over the chip. However, one problem with the <b>mesh</b> <b>architectures</b> is the difficulty in accurately analyzing large instances. Furthermore, variations in process and temperature, supply noise and crosstalk noise cause uncertainty in the delay from clock source to flip-flops. In this paper, we study the problem of analyzing timing uncertainty in mesh-based clock architectures. We propose solutions for both pure mesh and (<b>mesh</b> + global-tree) <b>architectures.</b> The solutions can handle large design and mesh instances. The maximum error in uncertainty values reported by our solutions is 1 - 3 ps {{with respect to the}} golden Monte Carlo simulations, which is at most 0. 5 % of the nominal clock latency of about 600 ps. ...|$|R

50|$|Wireless <b>mesh</b> <b>architecture</b> is a {{first step}} towards {{providing}} cost effective and low mobility over a specific coverage area. Wireless mesh infrastructure is, in effect, a network of routers minus the cabling between nodes. It's built of peer radio devices that don't have to be cabled to a wired port like traditional WLAN access points (AP) do. Mesh infrastructure carries data over large distances by splitting the distance into a series of short hops. Intermediate nodes not only boost the signal, but cooperatively pass data from point A to point B by making forwarding decisions based on their knowledge of the network, i.e. perform routing by first deriving the topology of the network.|$|E

40|$|The wave dynamic {{differential}} logic (WDDL) {{has been}} identified as a promising countermeasure to increase the robustness of cryptographic devices against differential power attacks (DPA). However, to guarantee the effectiveness of WDDL technique, the routing in both the direct and complementary paths must be balanced.

Then, we introduce a timing-balance-driven routing algorithm which is architecture independent. Our placement and routing techniques proved to be very promising. In fact, they achieve a gain of 95 %, 93 %, and 85 % in delay balance in tree-based, simple mesh, and cluster-based mesh architectures, respectively. To reduce further the switch and delay unbalance in <b>Mesh</b> <b>architecture,</b> we propose a differential pair routing algorithm that is specific to cluster-based <b>mesh</b> <b>architecture.</b> It achieves perfectly balanced routed signals in terms of wire length and switch number...|$|E
