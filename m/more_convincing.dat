5|$|By the 2004 DVD, Jabba's {{appearance}} was modified yet again {{to match his}} appearance in Episode I. When Han steps on Jabba's tail, Jabba reacts more strongly, winding up as if to punch him. Also, {{in order to make}} Jabba look <b>more</b> <b>convincing,</b> shadows of Han can be seen on his body.|$|E
5|$|The {{first test}} for the flying {{sequences}} involved simply catapulting a crash test dummy out of a cannon. Another technique had a remote control cast of Superman flying around. Both were discarded {{due to lack of}} movement. High-quality, realistic-looking animation was tried, with speed trails added to make the effect <b>more</b> <b>convincing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Capcom auditioned {{actors to}} be used as {{references}} by the character designers. The faces of the main protagonists were shaped and based on real people, while motion capture was used to animate their models. About 60 percent of the characters' motions were animated based on the captured data, while the rest was created from scratch. The developers initially struggled to develop a system for computer graphic animation. However, Nintendo provided Capcom with assistance and the problems were eventually solved. Capcom also hired new voice actors and rewrote the game's script to make the plot <b>more</b> <b>convincing.</b> The game was developed over the course of one year and two months. Final development of the game was very intense, as programmers had to work for two straight months with no days off to meet the proposed deadline. Resident Evil was released in March 2002 in Japan, April 2002 in North America, and September 2002 in Europe.|$|E

5|$|In January 2010, Singh {{was called}} for an {{audition}} by Shanoo Sharma, {{the head of the}} casting division for Yash Raj Films. They informed him that it was for a lead role in their film titled Band Baaja Baaraat, a romantic comedy set in the world of wedding planning. Aditya Chopra, {{the vice president of the}} company, later saw the audition tapes on video and was impressed by Singh's acting, and decided that he fit the part of Bittoo Sharma, the hero of the film. However, the director Maneesh Sharma needed some <b>more</b> <b>convincing</b> and he {{was called for}} a few more auditions over the next two weeks until they were completely convinced of his caliber. After the two weeks of testing, Singh was confirmed for the role of Bittoo, with Anushka Sharma playing the female lead.|$|E
5|$|The Member {{became a}} close {{associate}} and political {{friend of the}} Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger. After Pitt's death in 1806, Ferguson did not so easily retain his seat in Parliament. In the elections of 1806, he retained the seat by just two votes, and his opponent General Alexander Hay demanded he be investigated for bribery and corruption. Ferguson again beat Hay in the contest for the seat in June 1807, but {{this time with a}} <b>more</b> <b>convincing</b> majority of 54 to 39 votes. Ferguson was unopposed in the next three elections. Some records indicate that Ferguson never spoke in the Commons except to complain about a broken window behind his seat causing a draught. He is actually recorded as speaking on at least five occasions over the years.|$|E
5|$|Clarke was {{a critic}} of migrant labour schemes, which were {{designed}} to attract foreign labour to Rhodesia, and in 1900 he defended the rights of indigenous labour against infringement by foreign Africans from Mozambique, Nyasaland, Zambia and South Africa. As early as 1900, the BSAC came to the Colonial Office with a proposal regarding Chinese labour. In London, the Land and Mine Owners Association was formed in 1902 to lobby the Colonial Office and continued to press throughout 1903. The Colonial Office postponed its decision saying that the question concerned not only Rhodesia but all of southern Africa. Milner was lobbied by the BSAC and he promised his support. Clarke, however, dismissed the demands, arguing that 'the introduction {{of large numbers of}} Asiatics... will subject the aboriginal natives to unfair competition'. He forecast that the labour shortage was temporary and that the new bureau would satisfy demand. Clarke also argued that most Rhodesians were opposed to the introduction of Chinese labour. The Duke of Marlborough, then Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, recorded that he found Clarke's argument <b>more</b> <b>convincing</b> than Milner's, and the Colonial Office refused the proposal.|$|E
40|$|The {{authors have}} been working on the {{simulation}} of trees and in particular their representation in the landscape when massed as woodland or forest. The purpose of this work is to provide a representation of trees en masse that is <b>more</b> visually <b>convincing</b> when used in architectural and environmental compute aided design applications - architectural models, landscape design and evaluation, and historical reconstructions. Although our research was directed initially at producing a better compromise between realism and the economical use of polygons, we found that we were developing an impressionistic approach to modelling elements in the landscape which, if applied in other contexts, challenged the conventional approach of creating simulations from a literal translation of the geometry of the subject. The paper explains the process by which the software was delevoped, describes the interaction by which the user produces the scenes, and ends by proposing tools which would allow the user greater determination of those factors which create a <b>more</b> visually <b>convincing</b> simulation...|$|R

25|$|Nevertheless, Pierre-Paul Riquet, {{a wealthy}} {{collector}} of salt tax in Languedoc proposed a <b>more</b> <b>convincing</b> project than his predecessors.

50|$|Reception was {{reasonably}} positive, {{although the}} actor playing Samson was not {{thought to be}} <b>convincing.</b> <b>More</b> serious criticism was aimed at the film's structure, which was not considered to tie the modern storyline and the Biblical storyline together sufficiently.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{attempted to}} examine the effects of perceived tourism benefits on travel behavior based on the model of attitude importance. The results showed that the three factors of perceived tourism benefits – experiential, health, and relaxation benefits, had positive albeit weak effects on travel behavior through attitude importance, while the direct effects of the three benefit factors on travel behavior were not supported, which indicates that the tourism industry can encourage people to travel <b>more</b> by <b>convincing</b> them taking vacations is beneficial...|$|R
25|$|Welsh and Fanny headed East to New York, and on 7 May he {{made his}} New York debut against Johnny Frayne. The match went the full ten rounds, with the press giving Welsh the {{decision}} with a lukewarm report, comparing him unfavourably against Jim Driscoll. Welsh finished off his tour of America with far <b>more</b> <b>convincing</b> displays over Jack Goodman and Phil Brock. With his sights now on the Lonsdale Belt, Welsh travelled back to Britain.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} {{disaster}} in the fourth task, this task further influenced the decision in later series to give Sir Alan the chance to fire more than one candidate outside of the interview stage. Whilst Sir Alan deemed Michelle most at fault, {{he added that he}} was tired of Samuel's excuses and held him liable for the marketing aspect of the task. Ultimately, Michelle was saved by her better track record and her <b>more</b> <b>convincing</b> argument.|$|E
25|$|Finally, Dawkins {{searches}} {{for an explanation}} of morality based upon evolutionary biology, which he considers more hopeful than ancient texts. Together with the evolutionary psychologist , he discusses the primordial morality to be found among chimpanzees. Curry explains his view that we don't need religion to explain morality and if anything it simply gets in the way. Instead, he claims, a <b>more</b> <b>convincing</b> explanation {{is to be found}} in the concepts of reciprocal altruism and kin selection.|$|E
5000|$|Burnie {{has played}} in three Northern Grand Finals since 1997, winning one in 2003 {{defeating}} Launceston at Montello Sporting Ground in a memorable 14 -10. Big Willie Johnson scored the winning try under the posts with Josh Baldwin converting to secure the victory on the day. Burnie had narrowly lost in two grand finals to the Devonport Bulls. [...] In 2008 after its first season of the Statewide Second Division, Burnie won the championship with a <b>more</b> than <b>convincing</b> victory over Glenorchy.|$|R
60|$|Time was lost--and {{never was}} time <b>more</b> precious--in <b>convincing</b> Slape {{that this was}} no old wife's tale. At last, however, he won his way and twenty musketeers; but the quarter-past the hour had chimed ere they left the Castle. He led them forth at a sharp run, with never a thought for the {{circumstance}} that they would need their breath anon, perhaps for fighting, and he bade the man who guided them take them by back streets that they might attract as little attention as possible.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said I; {{and went}} over the same line of {{argument}} in a <b>more</b> solid and <b>convincing</b> manner.

25|$|To {{make the}} attack seem <b>more</b> <b>convincing,</b> the Germans murdered Franciszek Honiok, a 43-year-old {{unmarried}} German Silesian Catholic farmer known for sympathizing with the Poles. He {{had been arrested}} the previous day by the Gestapo. He was dressed {{to look like a}} saboteur, then killed by lethal injection, given gunshot wounds, and left dead at the scene so that he appeared to have been killed while attacking the station. His corpse was subsequently presented to the police and press as proof of the attack.|$|E
25|$|Mantram Handbook... is concise, {{simple and}} practical.... Where Easwaran scores over other books {{of a similar}} type is in his non-sectarian {{approach}} and his appeal to common-sense.... Second, Easwaran's account is deeply personal and, therefore, all the <b>more</b> <b>convincing.</b> He has traversed the same path himself and is aware of all the snares and pitfalls. The tone {{of the book is}} cheerful, optimistic and positive.... The book is not merely about mantrams. Its aim is the cultivation of a more wholesome and positive approach to life.|$|E
25|$|Zhang {{tried to}} render {{equality}} without contradiction between the particular and the universal. Zhang believed that conceptual framework is generated through our karmic actions. When compared to his contemporary Liu Shipei's attempt to extract logic from {{the masters of}} the Zhou dynasty, Zhang's writings and thoughts display {{a higher level of}} theoretical sophistication as he had a firmer grasp of the purposes and limitations of European logic as well as knowledge of yinming principles and thinking. This enabled him to draw <b>more</b> <b>convincing</b> parallels between the notions he gleaned from his plethora of sources.|$|E
50|$|On 30 November 1881 Saxony's Finance Minister, Léonçe von Könneritz, {{invited the}} two {{chambers}} of the Saxon parliament {{to visit the}} narrow-gauge railway; the intention was that local representatives should visit the railway and assess its capability. Since the result was <b>convincing,</b> <b>more</b> and more narrow-gauge lines were subsequently approved.|$|R
50|$|An Austrian princely family, the Rosenbergs, {{changed its}} name to Ursini-Rosenberg (and {{subsequently}} to Orsini-Rosenberg) in 1683, while creating spurious claims of kinship to the Orsini, who were regarded at the time as <b>more</b> prestigious. No <b>convincing</b> evidence of the link was ever produced, and many researchers consider it fictional.|$|R
2500|$|Many {{art historians}} have {{considered}} the painting one of Vermeer's less successful works.

25|$|Both Kikutake and Kurokawa capitalised on the {{interest}} in Tange's 1960 plan by producing their own schemes for Tōkyō. Kikutake's plan incorporated three elements both on {{the land and the}} sea and included a looped highway that connected all the prefectures around the bay. Unlike Tange however its simple presentation graphics put many people off. Kurokawa's plan consisted of helix-shaped megastructures floating inside cells that extended out across the bay. Although the scheme's <b>more</b> <b>convincing</b> graphics were presented as part of a film the project was not built.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the trading}} {{position}} was buoyant in the mid-1840s, as railways developed and improved their own services, the canal lost traffic heavily {{as the years}} passed. Thomson says that the Blackhill inclined plane was only used for about 37 years (i.e. until about 1831) but this is completely inconsistent with traffic volumes, and Hutton's statement that it worked until 1887 is <b>more</b> <b>convincing.</b> From that time the declining traffic volume did not require the continued use of the inclined plane, and after standing idle for some years it was finally scrapped.|$|E
25|$|England {{toured the}} West Indies for a three match ODI series. England {{kept the same}} {{that had been used}} against India. They won the first game by 45 runs after making 296–6 before bowling out the West Indies for 251. The second game was tighter, but an {{impressive}} partnership between Joe Root and Chris Woakes saw England chase down their target of 226 to win by four wickets. The final game of the series was <b>more</b> <b>convincing</b> for England, with them making a score of 328 following centuries from Joe Root and Alex Hales, before bowling the West Indies out for 142, winning game by 186 runs and the series 3–0.|$|E
40|$|Most {{physicians}} see disabilities only in {{the patients}} they treat, but some doctors speak from personal experience when they say disabilities {{should not be a}} barrier to practising medicine. Neurologist Gordon Robinson of Vancouver says the spinal problems that left him a paraplegic could not stop him from practising. Many aspects of his work didn't really require the use of his legs. He could still see patients in the office much as he had before simply by using an examining table that could be lowered. However, it may be <b>more</b> difficult <b>convincing</b> colleagues that physical disabilities are not an insurmountable barrier...|$|R

50|$|For example, theorists {{suggest that}} advocates of space {{exploration}} could achieve <b>more</b> success by <b>convincing</b> state actors of {{the merits of}} their proposals around the rubric of security rather than science: that space exploration could be framed around how it protects humanity from looming existential threats such as meteorites, rather than around how it helps advance scientific knowledge.|$|R
