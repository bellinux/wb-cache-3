5|$|Python's name {{is derived}} from the {{television}} series Monty Python's Flying Circus, and it is common to use <b>Monty</b> <b>Python</b> references in example code. For example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam and eggs, instead of the traditional foo and bar. Also, the official Python documentation and many code examples often contain various obscure <b>Monty</b> <b>Python</b> references.|$|E

5|$|The British comedy film <b>Monty</b> <b>Python</b> and the Holy Grail — {{a parody}} of the legends of King Arthur by the <b>Monty</b> <b>Python</b> team — was filmed on {{location}} in Scotland in 1974. The film's producers had gained permission from the National Trust for Scotland to film scenes at several of their Scottish castles, {{as well as the}} permission of Lord Moray to film at Doune Castle. However, the National Trust later withdrew their permission, leaving the producers with little time to find new locations. Instead, they decided to use different parts of Doune Castle to depict the various fictional castles in the film, relying on tight framing of shots to maintain the illusion.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} goal of Python's developers {{is making it}} fun to use. This {{is reflected in the}} origin of the name, which comes from <b>Monty</b> <b>Python,</b> and in an occasionally playful approach to tutorials and reference materials, such as using examples that refer to spam and eggs instead of the standard foo and bar.|$|E

5|$|The {{creative}} {{team was}} largely {{recruited from the}} mainstream adult UK comedy scene. They took inspiration from such quintessentially British historical-comedy classics as Blackadder and the <b>Monty</b> <b>Python</b> films. The series was a critical and ratings success, eventually gaining a wide all ages audience through its non-condescending and inclusive approach. It has won numerous domestic and international awards and has been named among the greatest British children's television series of all time.|$|E
5|$|Chapman took up pipe smoking aged 15, which {{continued}} {{for the remainder}} of his life. He began drinking heavily during his time at Cambridge and St Bartholomew's, favouring gin. By the time <b>Monty</b> <b>Python</b> went on tour in 1973, Chapman's drinking had begun to affect his performance, causing him to miss cues to go on stage. He stopped drinking in Christmas 1977, concerned at being able to act in Life of Brian successfully, and remained sober {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

5|$|In {{the post-war}} years, {{four of the}} Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals made their London debuts in Drury Lane, holding the stage almost {{continuously}} for nearly a decade, including Oklahoma! (1947–1950), Carousel (1950–1951), South Pacific (1951–1953) and The King and I (1953–1956). American imports also included Lerner and Loewe's My Fair Lady, which began a five-year run in 1958. Productions in the 1960s included Camelot (1964–1965), Hello, Dolly! (1965–1967) and The Great Waltz (1970–1972). In 1974, <b>Monty</b> <b>Python</b> recorded an album at the theatre, Live at Drury Lane.|$|E
5|$|Chapman {{was born}} in Leicester and was raised in Melton Mowbray. He enjoyed science, acting, and comedy, and after graduating from Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and St Bartholomew's Medical College, he turned down {{a career as a}} doctor to be a comedian. Chapman {{eventually}} established a writing partnership with John Cleese, which reached its critical peak with <b>Monty</b> <b>Python</b> in the 1970s. Chapman subsequently left Britain for Los Angeles, where he attempted to be a success on American television, speaking on the college circuit and producing the pirate film Yellowbeard, before returning to Britain in the early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The film {{started as}} a {{collaboration}} between Henson and Froud, with ideas for the film first being discussed between them following a screening of their previous collaboration, The Dark Crystal. Terry Jones of <b>Monty</b> <b>Python</b> wrote {{the first draft of}} the film's script early in 1984, drawing on Froud's sketches for inspiration. Various other scriptwriters, including Laura Phillips (who had previously written several episodes of Fraggle Rock), Lucas, Dennis Lee, and Elaine May, subsequently rewrote and made additions to the screenplay, although Jones received the film's sole screenwriting credit. Labyrinth was shot on location in Upper Nyack, Piermont and Haverstraw in New York, and at Elstree Studios and West Wycombe Park in the United Kingdom.|$|E
50|$|While The Chap appreciates British {{culture and}} loves tradition, it is {{strongly}} {{rooted in the}} Situationist strand of anarchism with more than the occasional nod to Dada. It is also indebted to the avant-garde as well as comedy greats such as the <b>Monty</b> <b>Pythons,</b> Peter Cook, Spike Milligan and Viv Stanshall.|$|R

50|$|As {{with any}} {{cultural}} icon, the gun barrel sequence has inspired numerous parodies and takeoffs since its {{first appearance in}} 1962. The sequence has been spoofed in films, sitcoms, cartoons and in advertisements, including: The Simpsons, SpongeBob SquarePants, Family Guy, <b>Monty</b> <b>Pythons</b> Flying Circus, Logorama, and Garfield and Friends. Wrestler Cesaros entrance is also {{similar to that of}} James Bond gun barrel sequence.|$|R
5|$|Bowie played Joseph Merrick in the Broadway theatre {{production}} The Elephant Man, {{which he}} undertook wearing no stage make-up, and which earned high praise for his expressive performance. He played the part 157 times between 1980 and 1981. Christiane F. – We Children from Bahnhof Zoo, a 1981 biographical film {{focusing on a}} young girl's drug addiction in West Berlin, featured Bowie in a cameo appearance as himself at a concert in Germany. Its soundtrack album, Christiane F. (1981), featured much material from his Berlin Trilogy albums. Bowie starred in The Hunger (1983), with Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon. In Nagisa Oshima's film the same year, Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence, based on Laurens van der Post's novel The Seed and the Sower, Bowie played Major Jack Celliers, {{a prisoner of war}} in a Japanese internment camp. Bowie had a cameo in Yellowbeard, a 1983 pirate comedy created by <b>Monty</b> <b>Python</b> members, and a small part as Colin, the hitman in the 1985 film Into the Night. He declined to play the villain Max Zorin in the James Bond film A View to a Kill (1985).|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 20th century, the {{influence}} of the romance tradition of Arthur continued, through novels such as T. H. White's The Once and Future King (1958) and Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon (1982) in addition to comic strips such as Prince Valiant (from 1937 onward). Tennyson had reworked the romance tales of Arthur to suit and comment upon the issues of his day, and the same is often the case with modern treatments too. Bradley's tale, for example, takes a feminist approach to Arthur and his legend, in contrast to the narratives of Arthur found in medieval materials, and American authors often rework the story of Arthur to be more consistent with values such as equality and democracy. The romance Arthur has become popular in film and theatre as well. T. H. White's novel was adapted into the Lerner and Loewe stage musical Camelot (1960) and the Disney animated film The Sword in the Stone (1963); Camelot, with its focus on the love of Lancelot and Guinevere and the cuckolding of Arthur, was itself made into a film of the same name in 1967. The romance tradition of Arthur is particularly evident and, according to critics, successfully handled in Robert Bresson's Lancelot du Lac (1974), Eric Rohmer's Perceval le Gallois (1978) and perhaps John Boorman's fantasy film Excalibur (1981); it is also the main source of the material used in the Arthurian spoof <b>Monty</b> <b>Python</b> and the Holy Grail (1975).|$|E
5|$|The game {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of weapons, including melee, projectile, and explosive weapons, as well as airstrike-based attacks. Some are based on real-life arms, such as the shotgun, bazooka, and hand grenade; others are rather fanciful and cartoonish, such as the sheep, which serves as a mobile explosive, and the skunk, which releases poisonous gas. In a normal match, all teams begin with the same weapons, based on the chosen weapon set. Some weapons may not become available until a certain number of turns pass. Depending on the game options, additional weapons may randomly fall onto the terrain in airdropped and teleported crates. In addition to normal weapons, during team creation, each team chooses a special weapon which becomes available to them after a certain number of turns. The special weapons are more powerful than regular weapons and often offer special abilities; super weapons will rarely fall in weapon crates. These weapons are often based on cartoonish themes, such as the French Sheep Strike, and usually devastating in power. In homage to the film <b>Monty</b> <b>Python</b> and the Holy Grail, one of the game weapons is a Holy Hand Grenade, with a sound-effect reminiscent of the Hallelujah chorus from Handel's Messiah.|$|E
50|$|The park {{served as}} the {{location}} for <b>Monty</b> <b>Pythons</b> Upper Class Twit of the Year sketch.
