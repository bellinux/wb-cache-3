25|$|Nepenthes leonardoi is {{exclusively}} terrestrial. Its typical {{habitat is}} upper montane forest (on the eastern ridge) and upper <b>montane</b> <b>scrub</b> (in the summit area of Schom-carp Peak). It is not sympatric with other Nepenthes species and no natural hybrids have been recorded. Like its close relatives, N.leonardoi is apparently outcompeted by bamboo and is consequently largely or completely {{absent from the}} highest parts of the eastern ridge. The infaunal community of N.leonardoi pitchers includes small spiders and unidentified mosquito larvae, the latter being found in abundance in both lower and upper pitchers.|$|E

50|$|<b>Montane</b> willow <b>scrub</b> {{is one of}} the UK’s most {{rare and}} {{endangered}} habitats and is largely confined to the higher mountains of the Scottish Highlands where it is a relict of post-glacial vegetation. <b>Montane</b> willow <b>scrub</b> grows on moist, relatively base-rich soils in rocky situations on mountains but its distribution is restricted by grazing and it only survives on ungrazed ledges and on lightly grazed, steep rocky slopes or boulder fields, usually as small, discrete stands or more scattered bushes. Corrie Sharroch has the most extensive stand of <b>montane</b> willow <b>scrub</b> in the country.|$|R

40|$|Large {{succulent}} leaf rosettes are {{a characteristic}} life form in many deserts. In certain areas {{they become the}} dominant life form, creating a vegetation type indicated as rosette scrub. The large number of rosette species suggests a close relationship between form and environment. Rosettes are excellent harvesters of low-intensity rains and fogs. We propose that some rosette-dominated formations of the Mexican mountains, namely the <b>montane</b> rosette <b>scrub,</b> occur in altitudinal belts around mountains where fog is abundant. We sampled four altitudinal gradients in mountains with different flora recording the abundance and richness of plants. At one site, the Tehuacán Valley, we also measured the quantity of fog along the gradient, below, above and in the rosette scrub for one year. We found that the abundance and richness of succulent rosette species are strongly associated with altitude, showing maximum values in the well-defined elevational belts where the <b>montane</b> rosette <b>scrub</b> occurs. Other life forms, such as stem succulent cacti or woody shrubs, do not show this mid-elevation pattern. The altitudinal ranges where the <b>montane</b> rosette <b>scrub</b> occurs usually coincide with areas where clouds and fog form. Our micrometeorological measurements indicate that rosette plants growing within a cloud belt can increase their water supply by 10 – 100 % by harvesting fog. Outside these belts fog harvest is negligible. Desert rosettes constitute {{one of the most}} common fog-harvesting growth forms...|$|R

50|$|Distichlis spicata thrives along coastlines and on salt {{flats and}} {{disturbed}} soils, {{as well as}} forest, woodland, <b>montane,</b> and desert <b>scrub</b> habitats. It can form dense monotypic stands, and it often grows in clonal colonies. Non-clonal populations tend to be skewed toward a majority of one sex or the other. The grass forms sod with its hearty root system. Its rhizomes have sharp points which allow it to penetrate hard soils and aerenchymous tissues, which allow it to grow underwater and in mud. This plant grows easily in salty and alkaline soils, excreting salts from its tissues via salt glands.|$|R
50|$|Nepenthes rigidifolia is {{endemic to}} Sumatra, {{where it has}} been {{recorded}} from a single small area near Sidikalang in Karo Regency, North Sumatra province. The only known population of this species grows on a road bank. The describing authors counted 24 mature plants at the type locality. Subsequent field observations suggest that the population has since dwindled in number, with perhaps only two plants remaining. Nepenthes rigidifolia grows terrestrially in lower <b>montane</b> forest and <b>scrub.</b> Young plants have been observed growing as lithophytes. The species has an altitudinal distribution of 1000-1600 m above sea level. It grows sympatrically with N. spectabilis and a natural hybrid between these species has been recorded.|$|R
