25|$|The adult female tick {{is usually}} {{attached}} {{for a minimum}} of 3 days before the very earliest signs are noticed although a very observant person <b>might</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> notice a slight change in behavior after 48 hrs of attachment (in a warm climate). Typically, however, a person would not notice obvious signs until at least the 4th day of attachment. In colder weather the feeding process is slowed down considerably and some animals may not show significant signs of paralysis for as long as two weeks. Furthermore, dogs rarely show significant signs until the adult female has engorged to a width of at least 4mm (measured {{at the level of the}} spiracles, see photo of lateral view of Ixodes holocyclus).|$|E
25|$|In foreign relations, the Ilkhanate's {{conversion}} to Islam {{had little to}} no effect on its hostility towards other Muslim states, and Ghazan continued to fight the Mamluks for control of Syria. The Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar, the only major victory by the Mongols over the Mamluks, ended the latter's control over Syria, though this lasted only a few months. For the most part, Ghazan's policies continued under his brother Öljeitü despite suggestions that he <b>might</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> favor the Shi'a brand of Islam after he came {{under the influence of}} Shi'a theologians Al-Hilli and Maitham Al Bahrani. Öljeitü succeeded in conquering Gilan on the Caspian coast, and his tomb in Soltaniyeh remains the best known monument of Ilkhanid rule in Persia.|$|E

25|$|Episode four: Chris and Tracey - Tracey and Chris {{have been}} married {{just over a year}} and were very much in love. But even though they were very happy together, they feel under {{constant}} pressure from others around them, because Tracey is forty-two and her husband Chris is just twenty-four. With an eighteen-year age gap, Chris is often mistaken for Tracey's son. Woodall and Susannah see that both their wardrobes needed revamping and modernising which will help the couple bridge their age gap. Tracey and Chris hope that by dressing differently they <b>might</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> look more like a couple and be more accepted together. Constantine helps Tracey to overcome her body insecurities by investing in some good items that will emphasize her good figure. As a result of a new appearance, Tracey begins to feel more glamorous. The pair are given a new look and are once again reunited.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} vote, on April 23, {{it was obvious}} that neither a strong Spanish {{candidate}} nor a strong French candidate could be elected. Medici and d'Este met, and Medici proposed two possible compromise candidates to d'Este: Cardinal Albani and Cardinal Felice Peretti Montalto. Madruzzo's chosen candidate was Cardinal Sirleto, but in a meeting with d'Este shortly after he entered the Conclave on the 24th, it was made clear to him that Sirleto was being excluded by the votes of the French. Madruzzo declared that he would not accept Albani. D'Este met with Cardinal Farnese, hoping to stop any effort that Farnese <b>might</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> exclude Montalto. He had already been trying to organize some of Gregory XIII's cardinals into a faction of his own. Farnese already believed that Montalto had little real support, and d'Este encouraged that misapprehension. But, when all the likely votes were tallied, it seemed that the supporters of Montalto lacked four votes, which would have to come from Farnese. When the Cardinals assembled to begin the balloting, d'Este suddenly intervened and announced that it was not necessary to proceed to a ballot since they already had a pope—Cardinal Montalto. The cardinals immediately proceeded to 'adore' Montalto—which was a legitimate method for electing a pope. There had to be no opposition, and there was none. Farnese had been silenced and coerced into cooperation.|$|E

Maybe about 10 more films (and as many drama coaches) from now Elvis <b>might</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> get an inkling of what acting's all about." [...] TV-Radio Mirror {{magazine}} praised Presley's acting over his past roles: [...] "Elvis Presley does his strongest acting job so far. Two years ago, Presley on the screen was a laughing stock. [...] But nobody is laughing now". Meanwhile, The Monthly Film Bulletin criticized the violence depicted in the film and rated the movie a III, denoting poor, stating, [...] "This entangled series of cliches, each with more unlikely motivation than the last, provides the most unattractive Presley vehicle so far. His numbers only offer intermittent relief from the calculated violence and viciousness, and he can do little to balance the disagreeable movie".|$|E

2500|$|As FWP {{began its}} {{biennial}} rulemaking for all state parks in late 2012, it considered requiring Smith River users to use bear-proof food storage methods. Although {{the agency said}} it was not proposing a rule, it wanted public comment on the issue, which some members of the public and some outfitters considered burdensome. [...] "Food-conditioned" [...] black bears (those used to scavenging for food around humans, and not afraid of human contact) were becoming more common near the Smith River as permanent developments increased, and the agency expressed concern that these bears <b>might</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> seek out food at boat camps.|$|E
2500|$|The Double-ten Directive {{stressed}} on the [...] "educational" [...] {{effects of}} the campaign, and cases of execution were publicized by the newspapers to inform the masses. However, following {{the implementation of the}} campaign, Liu Shaoqi became concerned that the campaign could become too excessive. He stated, [...] "If every execution is to appear on the newspapers, then there would be too much of the news on execution. I am afraid there would be side effects, like someone <b>might</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> show suspicion on us being 'kill too many' or 'overreact'", arguing that the campaign should be moderated to avoid creating a negative image of the CCP.|$|E
2500|$|Embracing {{the symbols}} of the British {{presence}} in the American colonies, such as the monarchy, the episcopate, and even {{the language of the}} Book of Common Prayer, the Church of England almost drove itself to extinction during the upheaval of the American Revolution. [...] Anglicans leaders realized, in the words of William Smith's 1762 report to the Bishop of London that, [...] "The Church is the firmest Basis of Monarchy and the English Constitution." [...] The danger he saw was that if dissenters of [...] "more Republican ... Principles [...] little affinity to the established Religion and manners" [...] of England ever gained the upper hand, the colonists <b>might</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> think of [...] "Independency and separate Government". Thus [...] "in a Political as well as religious view", Smith stated emphatically, the church should be strengthened by an American bishop and the appointment of [...] "prudent Governors who are friends of our Establishment". However, republicanism was rapidly gaining strength and opposition to an Anglican bishop in America was fierce.|$|E

60|$|Then the lindorm <b>began</b> <b>to</b> writhe, and groan, {{and breathe}} heavily; {{and after a}} little he had cast his outer skin, which lay on the floor, hideous to behold. Then his bride took off one of her snow-white shirts, and cast it on the lindorm's skin. Again he ordered her to undress, and again she {{commanded}} {{him to do so}} first. He had to obey, and with groaning and pain cast off one skin after another, and for each skin the maiden threw off one of her shirts, until there lay on the floor seven lindorm skins and six snow-white shirts; the seventh she still had on. The lindorm now lay before her as a formless, slimy mass, which she with all her <b>might</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> scrub with the lye and new scrubbing brushes.|$|R
2500|$|The {{review in}} The Times issue of 16 May 1928 began, [...] "Another French detective! We islanders <b>might</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> feel jealous, {{if we did}} not {{remember}} what a start Poe and Gaboriau gave our neighbours". The review questioned, [...] "whether you can make a play out of theoretical analysis. The old melodramas based themselves upon passion: then – shall we say with William Gillette's Sherlock Holmes and Sir Gerald du Maurier's Raffles? – personality usurped its place. A pure problem has not the dramatic force of either. If we do not weary of Poirot shooting questions to left and right, Poirot with uplifted finger expounding his views to a half-circle of listeners, it is because Mr. Charles Laughton, {{with a little help from}} the text, makes a personality out of the fat and sentimental little ratiocinator. His Poirot is an admirable comedy sketch, convincingly gallic." [...] The review stated that Lady Tree had no scope within the part given to her to invest the part of Mrs. Ackroyd with personality but [...] "competence was all that was demanded from her, and from the rest of the cast, and it was generally forthcoming. One actor singled out for praise was Henry Daniell for his [...] "imperturbably natural butler" [...] however his [...] "mystery...was not...analysed enough".|$|E
