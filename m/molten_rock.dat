5|$|Eruptive {{activity}} in the Mount Cayley volcanic field is typical of past volcanism elsewhere in the Garibaldi Belt. Large earthquakes would occur under the volcanic field weeks to years in advance as <b>molten</b> <b>rock</b> intrudes through the Earth's rocky lithosphere. The extent of earthquakes and the local seismographs in this region would warn the Geological Survey of Canada and possibly cause an upgrade in monitoring. While <b>molten</b> <b>rock</b> breaks through the crust, {{the size of the}} volcano vulnerable to an eruption would probably swell and the area would rupture, creating much more hydrothermal activity at the regional hot springs and the formation of new springs or fumaroles. Small and probably significant rock avalanches may result and could dam the nearby Squamish River for a limited amount of time, such as those that occurred in the past without seismic activity and deformation related to magmatic activity. At some point the subsurface magma will produce phreatic eruptions and lahars. At this time Highway 99 would be out of service and the residents of Squamish would have to travel away from the eruptive zone.|$|E

They are shifted 30 to 60 degrees to the east. A study published by Tyler et al. (2015) suggests that this eastern shift may be caused by an ocean of <b>molten</b> <b>rock</b> under the surface. The movement of this magma would generate extra heat through friction due to its viscosity. The study's authors believe that this subsurface ocean is a mixture of molten and solid rock.|$|E
5|$|The steep-sided, {{symmetrical}} stratovolcanoes in {{the region}} were built by repeated eruptions of thick, slow-moving lava that have commonly flowed only a few kilometres from the vent. Explosive eruptions are often associated with these volcanoes, depositing alternating layers of volcanic ash, cinders, blocks, and globes of <b>molten</b> <b>rock</b> called volcanic bombs or lava bombs, which are added to its slopes to create the stratovolcano. Edziza's stratovolcanoes contain a fine-grained silica-rich volcanic rock called trachyte; they have not erupted for thousands of years, allowing erosion to destroy the original cone, creating craggy ridges and rock outcrops of more resistant materials.|$|E

5|$|Edziza's rounded, steep-sided lava domes {{were built}} by eruptions of very thick light-coloured magma, {{including}} trachyte. Such magmas are typically too thick to move {{far from the}} vent it extrudes from, causing it to solidify quickly and build on previous volcanic extrusions, creating a characteristic dome-like shape. The thickness of the magma is attributed {{to high levels of}} silica, a naturally occurring silicon dioxide found in various crystalline and amorphous forms. Edziza's domes reach heights of several hundred metres, and grew slowly and steadily for months to years. The sides of these structures are composed of unstable rock debris. Due to the possibility of the building of gas pressure, the dome can experience more explosive eruptions over time. When part of a lava dome collapses while it still contains <b>molten</b> <b>rock</b> and gases, it can produce a pyroclastic flow, a super-heated mix of gas, ash, and pumice.|$|E

Shocked minerals have their internal structure deformed, and are created by intense pressures such as those associated with nuclear blasts or meteorite impacts.

Previous attempts to numerically model these behaviors have been plagued either by poor resolution at the fluid interfaces or high computational costs. We employ the Fast Multipole Boundary Element Method, which tracks the evo-lution of the fluid interfaces explicitly and is scalable to large problems, to model these systems. The microstructure of partially <b>molten</b> <b>rocks</b> strongly influences the macro-scopic physical properties. The fractional area of intergranular contact, contiguity, is a key parameter that controls the elastic strength of the grain network in the partially molten aggregate.

40|$|Chemical {{differentiation}} of rocky planets occurs by melt segregation {{away from the}} region of melting. The mechanics of this process, however, are complex and incompletely understood. In partially <b>molten</b> <b>rocks</b> undergoing shear deformation, melt pockets between grains align coherently in the stress field; it has been hypothesized that this anisotropy in microstructure creates an anisotropy in the viscosity of the aggregate. With the inclusion of anisotropic viscosity, continuum, two-phase-flow models reproduce the emergence and angle of melt-enriched bands that form in laboratory experiments. In the same theoretical context, these models also predict sample-scale melt migration due to a gradient in shear stress. Under torsional deformation, melt is expected to segregate radially inward. Here we present new torsional deformation experiments on partially <b>molten</b> <b>rocks</b> that test this prediction. Microstructural analyses {{of the distribution of}} melt and solid reveal a radial gradient in melt fraction, with more melt toward the centre of the cylinder. The extent of this radial melt segregation grows with progressive strain, consistent with theory. The agreement between theoretical prediction and experimental observation provides a validation of this theory, which is critical to understanding the large-scale geodynamic and geochemical evolution of Earth.

40|$|Olivine is {{the most}} {{abundant}} mineral in Earth's upper mantle {{and is one of}} the major minerals discovered in extraterrestrial objects. Its physical properties govern the dynamics of the upper mantle. The most dynamic regions of the upper mantle are sites where melting and melt segregation occurs. These regions are also the most variable in terms of their oxygen fugacity. We therefore conducted piston cylinder experiments to determine the intergranular melt distribution, and explore a range of oxygen buffers. We annealed olivine aggregates in metallic and graphite capsules to determine the oxygen fugacities set by the capsule materials. These experiments show that oxygen fugacities are below their corresponding metal-oxide buffers. The oxygen fugacity in nickel 80 -iron 20 and graphite capsules most closely represents the intrinsic oxygen fugacity of Fo 90 olivine, while iron capsules are too reducing perhaps explaining the formation of "dusty" olivine in chondrites. We annealed olivine-basalt aggregates in order to determine the melt distribution. The results show that the length of olivine grain boundaries wetted by melt (grain boundary wetness) increases with increasing melt content to values well above those predicted by a simplified model which is commonly applied to this system. At fixed melt content the grain boundary wetness increases with increasing grain size. These observations emphasize that the dihedral angle of the simplified system is not adequate to characterize the melt distribution in partially <b>molten</b> <b>rocks.</b> Our observations indicate that at upper mantle grain sizes the shear viscosity of partially <b>molten</b> <b>rocks</b> is one order of magnitude lower than predicted by the simplified model. Naturally partially <b>molten</b> <b>rocks</b> exist in the form of olivine-rich troctolites or plagioclase dunites, but the conditions for their formation are not entirely clear. We therefore conducted step-cooling experiments that indicate that slow cooling of samples with a steady-state microstructure reproduces the interstitial geometry observed in natural samples. The grain boundary wetness determined from the interstitial phases is somewhat reduced during slow cooling relative to samples quenched from high temperature. The microstructural similarity of experimental and natural samples suggests that mush zones identified beneath mid-ocean ridges may have lower melt contents than previously envisioned. 2016 - 11 - 18 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|R

Grain boundary wetness, {{a measure of the}} intergranular melt distribution, was determined by analyzing scanning electron microscope images with sufficiently high resolution to detect thin layers wetting grain boundaries, as well as small triple junctions. The measurements show that grain boundary wetness increases with increasing melt content to values well above those predicted by the idealized isotropic equilibrium model for a finite dihedral angle. Additionally, the melt geometry changes with grain size, with grain boundary wetness increasing with increasing grain size at fixed melt content. Grain boundary wetness and dihedral angle of samples annealed {{at a range}} of temperatures, but constant melt content does not depend on temperature. These observations emphasize that the dihedral angle alone is not adequate to characterize the melt distribution in partially <b>molten</b> <b>rocks,</b> as the idealized isotropic model does not account for the influence of grain growth.
