5|$|In 1975 {{the local}} Morris dancer John Byfleet made {{a replica of}} the {{original}} Ooser, which he carved from a log using a penknife. This replica is on display at Dorset County Museum in Dorchester. It is taken from the museum twice a year, on <b>May</b> <b>Day</b> and St. George's Day, when it is used by the Wessex Morris Men as part of their seasonal festivities. In 2005, a journalist from The Guardian reported on a dawn ceremony performed by the troupe on <b>May</b> <b>Day</b> atop Giant Hill near Cerne Abbas. The ceremony involved one member carrying the Dorset Ooser replica atop his head, with other Morris men dancing around him; after the rite they proceeded, still dancing, to a local pub, the Red Lion. In summer 2006, the Wessex Morris Men took the replica to Melbury Osmond for the first time, where they performed a dance in a local street.|$|E

Both teams were allocated 25,074 tickets for the final, which was 7,000 fewer than they received for the semi-finals. 17,000 tickets went to Club Wembley members, who are effectively season ticket holders at Wembley Stadium, while the remainder went to the grassroots football community.|$|E

5|$|The {{park was}} {{established}} by Henry VIII in 1536 {{when he took the}} land from Westminster Abbey and used it as a hunting ground. It opened to the public in 1637 and quickly became popular, particularly for <b>May</b> <b>Day</b> parades. Major improvements occurred in the early 18th century under the direction of Queen Caroline. Several duels took place in Hyde Park during this time, often involving members of the nobility. The Great Exhibition of 1851 was held in the park, for which the Crystal Palace, designed by Joseph Paxton, was erected.|$|E
5|$|After the Early Neolithic, {{the long}} barrow {{fell into a}} state of ruined dilapidation, perhaps {{experiencing}} deliberate destruction in the Late Medieval period, either by Christian iconoclasts or treasure hunters. In local folklore, the site became associated with the burial of a prince and the countless stones motif. The ruin attracted the interest of antiquarians in the 19th century, while archaeological excavation took place in the early 20th. In 1926, ownership was transferred to heritage charity The National Trust. Open without charge to visitors all year around, the stones are the site of a rag tree, a <b>May</b> <b>Day</b> morris dance, and various modern Pagan rituals.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Periyar in 1973, {{conferences}} were held throughout Tamil Nadu for a week in January 1974. The same year Periyar's wife, Maniyammai, {{the new head of}} the Dravidar Kazhagam, set fire to the effigies of 'Rama', 'Sita' and 'Lakshmana' at Periyar Thidal, Madras. This was in retaliation to the Ramaleela celebrations where effigies of 'Ravana', 'Kumbakarna' and 'Indrajit' were burnt in New Delhi. For this act she was imprisoned. During the 1974 <b>May</b> <b>Day</b> meetings held at different places in Tamil Nadu, a resolution urging the Government to preserve 80 percent of jobs for Tamils was passed. Soon after this, a camp was held at Periyar Mansion in Tiruchirapalli to train young men and women to spread the ideals of the Dravidar Kazhagam in rural areas.|$|E

5|$|Antigua had {{a general}} {{election}} in 2004, following the dissolution of Parliament in late February; with the ALP running a full slate, Joseph was nominated for the St Mary's North seat. The ALP were conclusively defeated by the United Progressive Party (UPP) and forced out of government, Joseph lost his seat to Bertrand Joseph. Now in opposition, the ALP held a leadership contest in 2005, in which Joseph was elected Party Chairman, defeating Vere Bird, Jr. 164 votes to 108. In 2007, he was appointed by Bird to act as Shadow Minister for Tourism and Education. In the 2009 general election he again ran for St Mary's North, defeating Bertrand Joseph by 21 votes; despite this, the UPP retained power. Following an unauthorised ALP march on <b>May</b> <b>Day</b> in 2009 to protest against the UPP government, Joseph and six other senior ALP figures, including the former Prime Minister, were {{arrested and charged with}} public order offences. They pleaded not guilty, but were convicted and fined.|$|E
5|$|At a <b>May</b> <b>Day</b> rally, held on Sunday 6 May in Eastville, local Trades Council members {{publicly}} criticised the TGWU. On {{the same}} day Paul Stephenson had organised a demonstration march to St Mary Redcliffe church, {{but there was a}} poor turnout. Some local West Indians said they should not ripple the water and, according to Roy Hackett, they may have feared victimisation. The dispute led to what has been described as one of the largest mailbags that the Bristol Evening Post had ever received, with contributors writing in support of both sides of the issue.|$|E

Zorin identifies Bond as an agent, has <b>May</b> <b>Day</b> assassinate Tibbett, and believes that his attempt to assassinate Bond has been successful. Afterwards, General Gogol of the KGB confronts Zorin for killing Bond without permission and reveals that Zorin was initially trained and financed by the KGB but has now gone rogue. Later, Zorin unveils to a group of investors his plan to destroy Silicon Valley which will give him—and the potential investors—a monopoly over the microchip industry.|$|E

5|$|Despite this decision, Bird {{returned}} to government on 15 May 1996 as Minister of Science, Technology and Communications, with a {{transfer to the}} Ministry of Trade, Industry and Business Development following the 1999 general election. In 2000, he became Minister of Agriculture, Lands and Fisheries; in this role, he negotiated {{an end to the}} Antiguan boycott of agricultural goods from Trinidad and Tobago. The ALP lost the 2004 general election and were replaced by a United Progressive Party government under Baldwin Spencer. Bird remained involved in politics, and along with six other senior ALP members was arrested in 2009 after an unauthorised <b>May</b> <b>Day</b> rally. The seven politicians were found guilty of public order offences, although the trial was delayed following a seizure suffered by Bird. He suffered two more seizures in 2010, after the completion of the trial, and died on 31 March 2013 of heart failure.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1920s and 1930s, Dælenenga was {{dominated}} by the Workers' Sports Federation (AIF) and served as its main stadium in Oslo. AIF's Grünerløkka chapter was established at Dælenenga and used it as its training ground. Dælenenga was used for major AIF tournaments and the largest tournament took place 5 July 1929, with 500 participants. It also served as the terminus of many of AIF's and other labor movement parades. Each <b>May</b> <b>Day</b> the stadium would be packed. From the early 1930s, AIF moved its largest tournaments to Jordal. The local AIF club was particularly good at boxing, and in 1937 gathered thousands of spectators to watch a boxing match at Dælenenga.|$|E
5|$|Eeyore's Birthday Party {{began in}} 1963 as a spring party and picnic for Department of English {{students}} at the University of Texas at Austin by Lloyd W. Birdwell, Jr. and other UT students. It was named for Eeyore, a chronically depressed donkey in A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh stories who, in one story, believes his friends have forgotten his birthday only to discover they have planned a surprise party for him. Despite its name, the event does not fall on the official birthday of the fictional character. The original event featured a trashcan full of lemonade, beer, honey sandwiches, a live, flower-draped donkey, and a may pole (in keeping with the event's proximity to <b>May</b> <b>Day).</b> For many years the party was a UT tradition, but subsequently the annual Birthday Party became a tradition in Austin's hippie subculture.|$|E
