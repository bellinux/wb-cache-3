The testing results have been exploited jointly with three relative permeability models of the pore space capillary type (Burdine's model type), these models are widely used and in rather distinct fields. To do so, capillary pressure has been correlated to saturation degree using six {{of the most popular}} relations encountered in the literature. Model predictions were systematically compared to the experimentally measured relative permeabilities presented {{in the first part of}} this work. Comparison indicated that the studied models underestimate the water relative permeability and over-estimate that of the non-wetting phase. Moreover, this modeling proves to be unable to locate the significant points that are the limits of fields of saturation where the variation of the relative permeabilities becomes consequent. We also showed that, if pore structure is modeled as a “bundle of capillary tubes”, model predications are independent of the capillary pressure curve measuring method...|$|R
50|$|This {{measured}} pressure permits {{obtaining the}} pore diameter, which is calculated {{by using the}} Young-Laplace formula P= 4*γ*cos θ*/D in which D is the pore size diameter, P is the pressure measured, γ is the surface tension of the wetting liquid and θ is the contact angle of the wetting liquid with the sample. The surface tension γ is a measurable physical property and depends on the wetting liquid used. The contact angle θ depends on {{the interaction between the}} material and the wetting liquid. In capillary flow porometry, in opposition to <b>mercury</b> <b>intrusion</b> porosimetry, the wetting liquid enters spontaneously the pores of the sample ensuring a total wetting of the material, and therefore the contact angle of the wetting liquid with the sample is 0 and the previous formula can be simplied as: P= 4*γ/D.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technique}} {{is closely related}} to using gas adsorption to measure pore sizes, but uses the Gibbs-Thomson equation rather than the Kelvin equation. They are both particular cases of the Gibbs Equations of Josiah Willard Gibbs: the Kelvin equation is the constant temperature case, and the Gibbs-Thomson equation is the constant pressure case.This behaviour {{is closely related to}} the capillary effect and both are due to the change in bulk free energy caused by the curvature of an interfacial surface under tension.The original equation only applies to isolated particles, but with the addition of surface interaction terms (usually expressed in terms of the contact wetting angle) can be modified to apply to liquids and their crystals in porous media. As such it has given rise to various related techniques for measuring pore size distributions. (See Thermoporometry and Cryoporometry.)The Gibbs-Thomson effect lowers both melting and freezing point, and also raises boiling point. However, simple cooling of an all-liquid sample usually leads to a state of non-equilibrium super cooling and only eventual non-equilibrium freezing. To obtain a measurement of the equilibrium freezing event, it is necessary to first cool enough to freeze a sample with excess liquid outside the pores, then warm the sample until the liquid in the pores is all melted, but the bulk material is still frozen. Then, on re-cooling the equilibrium freezing event can be measured, as the external ice will then grow into the pores.This is in effect an [...] "ice intrusion" [...] measurement (cf. <b>mercury</b> <b>intrusion),</b> and as such in part may provide information on pore throat properties. The melting event can be expected to provide more accurate information on the pore body.|$|E

The novelty of the present work is the lamination of tapes at room temperature without using plasticizers.

The {{restoration}} of historical buildings {{is very important}} for the history and culture of the cities and their population. It requires an advanced knowledge of the building materials used for the construction of these structures. Previously to any intervention in historical buildings, it is necessary a historic-scientific study of the original material. Historic mortars or concretes can reveal us different composition and the dependence on the geographical location and the time period of its construction. Historical concretes are complex systems that contain aerial or hydraulic binders or a blend of them, with aggregates, not always crystalline, and others elements that interact with the binder. The use of different techniques for microstructural characterization of materials, like optical microscopy, X-ray diffractometry or petrophysical analysis, allows the determination of the composition and some properties of these concretes. However, each technique has its own limits and, in many cases, several characterization techniques must be used to obtain coherent and reliable results. The present study focuses on the compositional characterization of Roman concrete from Roman buildings for public spectacles of Emerita Augusta, Mérida, Spain. An advanced knowledge of the Roman concrete composition is required to get a reliable restoration and preservation of these ancient monuments. Various samples of concrete were extracted from different zones from this archaeological site. The concrete was studied through mineralogical analysis (petrographic microscope and XRD) and petrophysical properties determination (bulk and real density, open porosity, <b>mercury</b> porosimetry <b>intrusion,</b> compressive strength and Ultrasound propagation velocity).

40|$|SUMMARY. Mercury {{has been}} {{determined}} by radiochemical neutron-activation analysis n nineteen representative rocks from the Skaergaard intrusion and in the separated cumulus minerals of five. The chilled marginal gabbro contains o' 23 ppm Hg, values in the Layered Series rocks ranging from o'o 7 to o' 34 ppm, in one exceptional case reaching I " 23 ppm Hg. There is a tendency for mercury to be more abundant in leucocratic than in average or melanocratic rocks at a similar horizon. Some-what higher levels of mercury {{are found in the}} granophyric rocks {{at the top of the}} intrusion. Apart from a weak and sporadic tendency to be preferentially enriched inplagioclase, the distribu-tion of mercury between the various cumulus phases i fairly uniform and it is thought to occur as uncharged atoms mainly occupying spaces resulting from lattice defects and imperfections rather than in specific structural sites. The distribution pattern of <b>mercury</b> in the <b>intrusion</b> appears to be determined by its high volatility and chemical inertness; no real evidence of any chalcophile character isobserved. MOSTLY due to the lack of reliable analytical data, little is known of the behaviour of mercury in igneous rocks; earlier spectrographic and colorimetric determinations could be regarded at best as semi-quantitative.

The hydrophobic material is produced in a form of powder, from which tablets with various shape, thickness and size can be formed by pressing. This material is used successfully in electrochemical systems operating with gaseous reactants, such as gas-diffusion electrodes 2 for fuel cells, metal-air batteries and other electrochemical devices, developed in this laboratory. The same nano-porous material is also used in the recently designed biosensors 3 for phenol as a hydrophobic oxygen-permeable carrier on which the enzyme-catalyst is immobilized. These electrochemical systems possess complicated porous structure comprising two types of pores: hydrophobic pores, through which a fast transport of the reactant (in gas phase) is achieved and hydrophilic pores (filled with electrolyte), where the electrochemical reaction is taking place.

Our study highlighted the role of populations in nearby rivers in providing metapopulation support, raising the concern that the population in the Ogeechee River acts as a demographic sink. As part of this study, we carried out a field sampling study to analyze effects of training activities on headwater streams.

30|$|With the {{increasing}} demands {{on energy and}} exhausting conventional resources, unconventional tight oil reservoirs are becoming important, and how to effectively develop them becomes a focus (Akanji et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2013). Tight oil reservoirs normally have complicated pore throat parameters, which determine the reservoirs quality and affect the oilfield development. Therefore, {{it is very important}} to quantitatively determine the dominant pore and throat parameters. Mercury injection method is a widely used technique for the evaluation of capillary pressure, pore size and throat size since Purcell introduced the technique to the industry (Brooks and Corey 1981; Katz and Thompson 1981, 1987; Pittman 1992; Purcell 1949). <b>Mercury</b> <b>intrusion</b> is a very useful method to gain quantitative data on the pore throat parameters. The measurement of pore throat size distributions from <b>mercury</b> <b>intrusion</b> has been of great benefit to reservoir evaluation in the oil and gas industry. Other petrophysical characteristics such as porosity, relative permeability and irreducible water saturation can be determined using mercury porosimetry (Vavra et al. 1992). Matthew et al. (1993) used the <b>mercury</b> <b>intrusion</b> to calculate network and absolute permeability in sandstone and other porous media. Lambropoulos et al. (2007) applied an innovative <b>mercury</b> <b>intrusion</b> technique and relative permeability to examine the thin layer pores of sol–gel and CVD post-treated membranes. Yao and Liu (2012) characterized pore size distributions of coals with low-field NMR and <b>mercury</b> <b>intrusion</b> porosimetry. Sasanian and Newson (2013) used <b>mercury</b> <b>intrusion</b> porosimetry for microstructural investigation of reconstituted clays at high water contents. Okolo et al. (2015) compared the porosity and surface areas of different coals as measured with <b>mercury</b> <b>intrusion.</b> Capillary pressure curves normally give information only on throat sizes rather than on the exact volume of the pore space (Yuan and Swanson 1989). In the usual experiment, mercury pressure is raised in increments and the injected mercury volume is measured. This is a pressure-controlled measurement of mercury capillary pressure curve. On account of the inherent ambiguity in capillary pressure curves, attempts to derive relationships between various petrophysical properties through capillary pressures are not always successful. Due to the conventional (pressure-controlled) method nature of measuring capillary pressure curves, it is possible to have different distributions of pore systems that would lead to the same capillary pressure curve. While the rate-controlled measurement can overcome the shortage of conventional <b>mercury</b> <b>intrusion</b> to get the quantity of pores and throats, draw capillary pressure curves of pores and throats, respectively, and obtain more accurate micro-pore structure characteristic parameters (Crawford and Hoover 1966; Morrow 1970; Yuan and Swanson 1989; Gao et al. 2013). The observation of fluctuations in mercury pressure during mercury injection is not new. In 1959, in an unpublished Shell report, Gates observed pressure fluctuations with mercury porosimetry measurement for vuggy carbonates. In 1966, Crawford and Hoover (1966) recorded capillary pressure fluctuations on a chart recorder during injecting the water into synthetic porous media. The infinitesimally slow displacement of a wetting fluid by a non-wetting fluid was discussed in detail by Morrow (1970). He introduced terminology to describe certain features of the pressure fluctuations that we describe in the latter section. In 1971, Gaulier (1971) published similar techniques for depicting vug volume, although the sensitivity was very low. From then on, some studies have been done to analyze the pore and throat parameters of low permeability sandstone (Yu et al. 2006; Hao et al. 2007; Lin et al. 2008; Gao et al. 2013). Nevertheless, up to now, there are only few researches that have applied the constant rate <b>mercury</b> <b>intrusion</b> to tight oil rocks and examined their pore and throat parameters.|$|E

Gas permeation and <b>mercury</b> <b>intrusion</b> are employed {{to characterize the}} macropore structure of the CMS while adsorption equilibria and kinetics are exploited for characterization of micropores. It is observed {{that the relationship between}} adsorbed phase mobility and gas-phase concentration obtained by measurement of the kinetics of adsorption follows the Darken relation. The trend in magnitude of the mobility parameter follows that of other CMS samples (O- 2 > CO 2 > N- 2 > Ar), and some deviation from Fickian behavior is observed in the uptake of larger molecules, presumably because of interference from a "pore mouth barrier"...|$|E
40|$|The {{microstructure}} {{of building}} materials greatly influences engineering properties like permeability, strength and durability. To determine this microstructure, different techniques were developed, {{each with its}} own limitations. The purpose of this study on concrete and natural building stones was to compare and to combine data obtained by X-ray computed micro-tomography (micro-CT), water absorption under vacuum and <b>mercury</b> <b>intrusion</b> porosimetry (MIP). Pore-size distribution curves ranging from 10 nm to 1 mm and total porosity results were obtained. Furthermore, micro-CT revealed the presence of an interfacial transition zone (ITZ) and of micro-cracks inside the aggregates of the concrete samples after <b>mercury</b> <b>intrusion.</b> Micro-CT visualized mercury inside large air bubbles within the concrete samples. Both micro-CT and MIP were compared and their respective advantages and disadvantages discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of admixed corrosion inhibitors on the pore structure of cement paste was evaluated {{by means of}} <b>mercury</b> <b>intrusion</b> porosimetry. Portland cement CEM I 52 - 5 N was used. Two different corrosion inhibitors were selected within this study. One was a calcium nitrite-based corrosion inhibitor, which contained minimum 30 % active ingredients by mass. The other corrosion inhibitor was an aqueous mixture of amine and ester. By means of <b>mercury</b> <b>intrusion</b> porosimetry it was shown that for each degree of cement hydration considered in the experimental programme, the cement paste with inhibitor had higher total pore volume than the reference cement paste. Furthermore, the threshold pore diameter of the samples with and without corrosion inhibitor did not vary significantly...|$|E

It is meaningful to reveal the key factors affecting physical property and the efficient oil recovery in tight oil reservoirs.|$|E
