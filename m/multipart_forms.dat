50|$|The {{advantages}} are:low purchase cost, {{can handle}} <b>multipart</b> <b>forms,</b> cheap to operate, only needs fresh ribbons, rugged, low repair cost {{and the ability}} to print on continuous paper. This makes it possible to print long banners that span across several sheets of paper.|$|E
50|$|Continuous form {{paper of}} all types remains in production, {{although}} largely supplanted {{with the introduction of}} fast laser printers with single-sheet feed. Continuous stationery printed on a suitable printer is typically cheaper than laser printing although the output is of lower quality. If an impact printer is used multiple simultaneous copies can be printed on <b>multipart</b> <b>forms.</b> Many laser printers can print {{on both sides of the}} paper (duplex printing), not possible with continuous stationery.|$|E

50|$|Continuous {{stationery}} (UK) or continuous form paper (USA) is paper {{which is}} designed for use with dot-matrix and line printers with appropriate paper-feed mechanisms. Other names include fan-fold paper, sprocket-feed paper, burst paper, tractor-feed paper, and pin-feed paper. It can be single-ply (usually woodfree uncoated paper) or multi-ply (either with carbon paper between the paper layers, or multiple layers of carbonless copy paper), often described as <b>multipart</b> stationery or <b>forms.</b> Continuous stationery is often used when the final print medium is less critical {{in terms of the}} appearance at the edges, and when continuously connected individual sheets are not inconvenient for the application. Individual sheets can be separated at the perforation (leaving a slight serration), and sheets also have edges with punched holes, which also can be removed at the perforation (one typical format).|$|R
