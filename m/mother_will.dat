5|$|Earwigs {{are among}} the few non-social insect species that show {{maternal}} care. The <b>mother</b> <b>will</b> {{pay close attention to}} the needs of her eggs, such as warmth and protection, though {{studies have shown that the}} mother does not pay attention to the eggs as she collects them. The mother has been shown to pick up wax balls by accident, but they would eventually be rejected as they do not have the proper scent. The <b>mother</b> <b>will</b> also faithfully defend the eggs from predators, not leaving them to eat unless the clutch goes bad. Another distinct maternal care unique to earwigs is that the mother continuously cleans the eggs to protect them from fungi. Studies have found that the urge to clean the eggs persists for days after they are removed; when the eggs were replaced after hatching, the mother continued to clean them for up to 3 months.|$|E
5|$|Pairs {{separate}} after mating, {{and females}} provide all parenting. The gestation period lasts 93–105 days; females {{give birth to}} up to four cubs, and most commonly to two. The <b>mother</b> <b>will</b> not tolerate the presence of males {{after the birth of}} cubs, given a risk of infanticide; this behavior is also found in the tiger.|$|E
5|$|A clutch {{consists}} of three to five light-blue eggs, and is incubated by the female alone. The eggs hatch after 14days, and the chicks leave the nest a further two weeks later. The altricial chicks are naked and have their eyes closed {{for the first few}} days after hatching. While the chicks are still young, the mother broods them continuously. When they are older, the <b>mother</b> <b>will</b> brood them only at night or during bad weather.|$|E
50|$|On {{subsequent}} fasts, <b>mothers</b> <b>will</b> {{fill the}} Jhakri will water and jaggery and rice. When the moon rises, an offering {{is made to}} the stars and then the sons. Other food will also {{be given to the}} sons. Thereafter, <b>mothers</b> <b>will</b> eat something sweet an open the fast.|$|R
50|$|M. microtis <b>mothers</b> <b>will</b> provide pups with prey {{items for}} 5 months after weaning.|$|R
50|$|Often during nurse-ins, nursing <b>mothers</b> <b>will</b> wear {{clothing}} {{with the}} International Breastfeeding Symbol on it, {{to show their}} solidarity.|$|R
5|$|Lukesh {{then returns}} to the {{alleyway}} where Doggett was shot and vanishes. Based on the contradictory evidence, Reyes concludes that Lukesh can travel between parallel universes in order to kill. She also concludes that the unharmed Doggett disappeared because {{two versions of the}} same person cannot exist in the same universe. Follmer and Skinner question Lukesh, who becomes agitated when his mother is mentioned. Noting this, Skinner decides to hint that his <b>mother</b> <b>will</b> be questioned, which leads Lukesh to become more uncomfortable. Lukesh returns home to find his mother has found the gun with which he shot Doggett. After she threatens to talk to the FBI, Lukesh kills her.|$|E
5|$|Male orangutans play {{almost no}} role in raising the young. Females {{do most of the}} caring and socializing of the young. A female often has an older {{offspring}} with her to help in socializing the infant. Infant orangutans are completely dependent on their mothers for {{the first two years of}} their lives. The <b>mother</b> <b>will</b> carry the infant during travelling, as well as feed it and sleep with it in the same night nest. For the first four months, the infant is carried on its belly and never relieves physical contact. In the following months, the time an infant spends with its mother decreases.|$|E
5|$|When Henry Dashwood (Simon Williams) dies, {{he leaves}} his entire fortune and his home, Norland Park, {{to his son}} John (Mark Gatiss). John {{promises}} that he will provide for his stepmother, Mrs. Dashwood (Janet McTeer), and half-sisters Elinor (Hattie Morahan), Marianne (Charity Wakefield), and Margaret (Lucy Boynton). However, John's wife, Fanny (Claire Skinner), convinces him to give the family a smaller inheritance than he had intended. Fanny's brother, Edward Ferrars (Dan Stevens), comes to visit, and he quickly befriends Elinor. While Mrs. Dashwood hopes they will become engaged, Fanny informs her that his <b>mother</b> <b>will</b> not approve the match. Mrs. Dashwood receives a letter from her cousin, Sir John Middleton (Mark Williams), offering her a small cottage house on his estate, Barton Park in Devonshire. She and her daughters decide to leave Norland immediately.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species of}} poison dart frogs are {{dedicated}} parents. Many poison dart frogs in the genera Oophaga and Ranitomeya carry their newly hatched tadpoles into the canopy; the tadpoles {{stick to the}} mucus {{on the backs of}} their parents. Once in {{the upper reaches of the}} rainforest trees, the parents deposit their young in the pools of water that accumulate in epiphytic plants, such as bromeliads. The tadpoles feed on invertebrates in their nursery, and their <b>mother</b> <b>will</b> even supplement their diet by depositing eggs into the water. Other poison frogs lay their eggs on the forest floor, hidden beneath the leaf litter. Poison frogs fertilize their eggs externally; the female lays a cluster of eggs and a male fertilizes them afterward, in the same manner as most fish. Poison frogs can often be observed clutching each other, similar to the manner most frogs copulate. However, these demonstrations are actually territorial wrestling matches. Both males and females frequently engage in disputes over territory. A male will fight for the most prominent roosts from which to broadcast his mating call; females fight over desirable nests, and even invade the nests of other females to devour competitor's eggs.|$|E
25|$|There is {{concrete}} evidence that advanced paternal age {{is associated with}} the increased likelihood that a <b>mother</b> <b>will</b> suffer from a miscarriage or that fetal death will occur.|$|E
25|$|They {{can also}} {{indicate}} {{an action that}} have started and {{is still going on}} during another action (equivalent of English continuous tenses), but they are almost never used in such a way: Kai grįši namo, motina bus bemieganti – When you will get back home, the <b>mother</b> <b>will</b> be sleeping.|$|E

25|$|Hamsters {{are born}} hairless and blind in a nest the <b>mother</b> <b>will</b> have {{prepared}} in advance. After one week, {{they begin to}} explore outside the nest. They are completely weaned after three weeks, or four for Roborovski hamsters. Most breeders will sell the hamsters to shops when they are three to nine weeks old.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} a hidden benefit {{involves}} Malarus cyaneus, the superb fairy-wren. In M. cyaneus, the presence of helpers at the nest {{does not lead to}} an increase in chick mass. However, the presence of helpers does confer a hidden benefit: it increases the chance that a <b>mother</b> <b>will</b> survive to breed in the next year.|$|E
25|$|This {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} younger mothers and offspring under their care will fare {{better in a}} difficult and predatory environment because a younger <b>mother</b> <b>will</b> be stronger and more agile in providing protection and sustenance for herself and a nursing baby. The various biological factors associated with menopause {{had the effect of}} male members of the species investing their effort with the most viable of potential female mates.|$|E

25|$|Some {{species of}} opossums have prehensile tails, {{although}} dangling {{by the tail}} is more common among juveniles. An opossum may also use its tail as a brace and a fifth limb when climbing. The tail is occasionally used as a grip to carry bunches of leaves or bedding materials to the nest. A <b>mother</b> <b>will</b> sometimes carry her young upon her back, where they will cling tightly even when she is climbing or running.|$|E
25|$|The common motif {{in those}} {{different}} parallels {{is that the}} wise judge announces an absurd procedure, which is reasonable in some perverse way: Splitting the baby, according {{to the principle of}} compromise; Or a tug war, in which one can possibly assume that the true <b>mother</b> <b>will</b> be motivated to pull harder. But this procedure is actually a concealed emotional test, designed to force each woman to decide whether her compassion to the baby overpowers her will to win.|$|E
25|$|Children will however {{automatically}} inherit their father's surname if {{they are}} considered legitimate. If the child is born out of wedlock, the <b>mother</b> <b>will</b> automatically pass her surname to the child, unless the father gives a written acknowledgment of paternity. The father may also choose to give the child both his parents' surnames if he wishes (that is Gustavo Paredes, whose parents are Eulogio Paredes and Juliana Angeles, while having Maria Solis as a wife, may name his child Kevin S. Angeles-Paredes.|$|E

5000|$|With all Nations temple is also celebrating Mother's Day {{on every}} 2nd sunday of May {{every year at}} Kilimarathukavu Temple. On this auspicious {{occasion}} the temple advisory committee and Satya sai seva organization put hands together for [...] "Mathru Pooja" [...] {{on the same day}} with hundreds of Mothers and children.The program is scheduled for one hour in which <b>Mothers</b> <b>will</b> be seated on chair and children on the floor. Children will do pooja to their Mother who is a representation of Devi, with milk, rose water and water by chanting mantras. And before the Pooja gets over <b>Mothers</b> <b>will</b> keep hands on child's head and bless them. At last <b>Mothers</b> <b>will</b> give sweet to their child and the Pooja gets over. As this being held on a sacred temple, every child will keep the ethics and in turn make mother child relationship ends forever. Hope in Kaliyuga, Mathrupooja is an eyeopener! ...|$|R

25|$|As I {{think about}} it, it {{is none of}} these things. They are not {{the reasons for this}} incident, there's a much later point to it all. Happiness. Yes happiness. If I am out of the way, all the family can get down to their own lives. <b>Mother</b> <b>will</b> {{not have to worry about}} me making my grades, and Daddy will not have to put out more money on me, which would do no more good than it did in high school.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{others have}} argued that {{although}} semantics does {{play a role in}} inalienable possession, it is not central to the syntactic class of case-derived possessives. For example, compare the difference between the book's contents and the book's jacket. While a book cannot be divorced from its contents, it can be removed from its jacket. Regardless, both phrases have the same syntactic structure. Another example is Mary's mother versus Mary's friend. The <b>mother</b> <b>will</b> always be Mary's mother, but an individual might not always be Mary's friend. Again, both have the same syntactic structure.|$|E
25|$|Grizzly bears {{have one}} of the lowest {{reproductive}} rates of all terrestrial mammals in North America. This is due to numerous ecological factors. Grizzly bears do not reach sexual maturity until they are at least five years old. Once mated with a male in the summer, the female delays embryo implantation until hibernation, during which miscarriage can occur if the female does not receive the proper nutrients and caloric intake. On average, females produce two cubs in a litter and the mother cares for the cubs for up to two years, during which the <b>mother</b> <b>will</b> not mate.|$|E
