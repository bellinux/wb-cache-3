40|$|In eukaryotes, genetic {{exchange}} between homologs is facilitated by a tripartite proteinaceous structure called the synaptonemal complex(SC). Several lines of evidence {{indicate that the}} genes that encode components of SC are essential for <b>meiotic</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>pairing</b> and recombination. However, the molecular mechanism by which SC proteins promote these processes is obscure. Here, we report that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hop 1 protein, a component of SC, promotes pairing between two double-stranded DNA helices containing a centrally located G/C isochore. Significantly, pairing was rapid and robust, and required four contiguous G/C base pairs. Using a series of truncated DNA double helices we show that 20 bp {{on either side of}} 8 bp target G/C sequenceis essential for pairing.

However, the number, nature and/or the mechanism used by SC proteins to align chromosomes are yet to be clearly defined. Here, we show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hop 1, a component of SC, was able to promote pairing of double-stranded DNA helices containing arrays of mismatched G/G sequences. Significantly, pairing was rapid and robust, independent of homology in the arms flanking the central G/G region, and required four contiguous guanine residues. Furthermore, data from truncated DNA double helices showed that 20 bp on either side of the 8 bp mismatched G/G region was essential for efficient synapsis.

40|$|Marsupials {{present a}} series of genetic and {{chromosomal}} features that are highly conserved in very distant species. One of these features {{is the absence of}} a homologous region between X and Y chromosomes. According to this genetic differentiation, sex chromosomes do not synapse during the first meiotic prophase in males, and a special structure, the dense plate, maintains sex chromosome association. In this report we present results on the process of <b>meiotic</b> sex <b>chromosome</b> <b>pairing</b> obtained from three different species, Thylamys elegans, Dromiciops gliroides, and Rhyncholestes raphanurus, representing the three orders of American marsupials. We have investigated the relationships between the axial structures organized along sex chromosomes and the formation of the dense plate. We found that in the three species the dense plate arises as a modification of sex chromosomal axial elements, but without the involvement of other meiotic axial structures, such as the cohesin axes. Considering the phylogenetic relationships among the marsupials studied here, our data reinforce the idea that the dense plate emerged early in marsupial evolution as an efficient mechanism to ensure the association of the nonhomologous sex chromosomes.

40|$|Meiosis {{is unique}} to germ cells and {{essential}} for reproduction. During the first <b>meiotic</b> division, homologous <b>chromosomes</b> <b>pair,</b> recombine, and form chiasmata. The homologues connect via axial elements and numerous transverse filaments to form the synaptonemal complex. The synaptonemal complex is a critical component for <b>chromosome</b> <b>pairing,</b> segregation, and recombination. We previously identified a novel germ cell-specific HORMA domain encoding gene, Hormad 1, {{a member of the}} synaptonemal complex and a mammalian counterpart to the yeast meiotic HORMA domain protein Hop 1. Hormad 1 is essential for mammalian gametogenesis as knockout male and female mice are infertile. Hormad 1 deficient (Hormad 1 (-/) (-)) testes exhibit meiotic arrest in the early pachytene stage, and synaptonemal complexes cannot be visualized by electron microscopy. Hormad 1 deficiency does not affect localization of other synaptonemal complex proteins, SYCP 2 and SYCP 3, but disrupts homologous <b>chromosome</b> <b>pairing.</b> Double stranded break formation and early recombination events are disrupted in Hormad 1 (-/) (-) testes and ovaries as shown by the drastic decrease in the γH 2 AX, DMC 1, RAD 51, and RPA foci. HORMAD 1 co-localizes with γH 2 AX to the sex body during pachytene. BRCA 1, ATR, and γH 2 AX co-localize to the sex body and participate in <b>meiotic</b> sex <b>chromosome</b> inactivation and transcriptional silencing. Hormad 1 deficiency abolishes γH 2 AX, ATR, and BRCA 1 localization to the sex chromosomes and causes transcriptional de-repression on the X chromosome. Unlike testes, Hormad 1 (-/) (-) ovaries have seemingly normal ovarian folliculogenesis after puberty. However, embryos generated from Hormad 1 (-/) (-) oocytes are hyper- and hypodiploid at the 2 cell and 8 cell stage, and they arrest at the blastocyst stage.

Apart from the Ph 1 locus of wheat that suppresses homeologous pairing, {{little is known about}} the activity of genes that contribute to the cytological diploidization of allopolyploids. In oilseed rape (Brassica napus) haploids, the amount of <b>chromosome</b> <b>pairing</b> at metaphase I (MI) of meiosis varies depending on the varieties the haploids originate from. In this study, we combined a segregation analysis with a maximum-likelihood approach to demonstrate that this variation is genetically based and controlled mainly by a gene with a major effect. A total of 244 haploids were produced from F(1) hybrids between a high- and a low-pairing variety (at the haploid stage) and their meiotic behavior at MI was characterized. Likelihood-ratio statistics were used to demonstrate that the distribution of the number of univalents among these haploids was consistent with the segregation of a diallelic major gene, presumably in a background of polygenic variation. Our observations suggest that this gene, named PrBn, is different from Ph 1 and could thus provide complementary information on the <b>meiotic</b> stabilization of <b>chromosome</b> <b>pairing</b> in allopolyploid species...|$|R

Surprisingly, we further demonstrate that components of the central region of the synaptonemal complex are already expressed in the mitotic region of the ovaries, localize close to centromeres, and promote de novo association of centromeres.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} in animal studies that, in animals heterozygous for pericentric chromosomal inversions, loop formation is greatly reduced during meiosis. This results in absence of recombination within the inverted segment, with recombination seen only outside the inversion. A recent study in yeast has shown that telomeres, rather than centromeres, lead in chromosome movement just prior to meiosis and {{may be involved in}} promoting recombination. We studied by cytogenetic analysis and DNA polymorphisms the nature of meiotic recombination in a three-generation family with a large pericentric X chromosome inversion, inv(X) (p 21. 1 q 26), in which Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) was cosegregating with the inversion. On DNA analysis {{there was no evidence of}} meiotic recombination between the inverted and normal X chromosomes in the inverted segment. Recombination was seen at the telomeric regions, Xp 22 and Xq 27 - 28. No deletion or point mutation was found on analysis of the DMD gene. On the basis of the FISH results, we believe that the X inversion is the mutation responsible for DMD in this family. Our results indicate that (1) pericentric X chromosome inversions result in reduction of recombination between the normal and inverted X chromosomes; (2) <b>meiotic</b> X <b>chromosome</b> <b>pairing</b> in these individuals is likely initiated at the telomeres; and (3) in this family DMD is caused by the pericentric inversion...|$|R
40|$|Prior to the <b>meiotic</b> divisions, dynamic <b>chromosome</b> reorganizations {{including}} <b>pairing,</b> synapsis, and recombination {{of maternal}} and paternal <b>chromosome</b> <b>pairs</b> must {{occur in a}} highly regulated fashion during <b>meiotic</b> prophase.

In addition, how the levels of recombination initiation and crossover formation are regulated so that sufficient, but not deleterious, levels of DNA breaks are made and processed into crossovers is not understood well. We show that in Caenorhabditis elegans, the highly conserved Serine/Threonine protein phosphatase PP 4 homolog, PPH- 4. 1, is required independently to carry out four separate functions involving <b>meiotic</b> <b>chromosome</b> dynamics: (1) synapsis-independent <b>chromosome</b> <b>pairing,</b> (2) restriction of synapsis to homologous chromosomes, (3) programmed DNA double-strand break initiation, and (4) crossover formation. Using quantitative imaging of mutant strains, including super-resolution (3 D-SIM) microscopy of chromosomes and the synaptonemal complex, we show that independently-arising defects {{in each of these}} processes in the absence of PPH- 4. 1 activity ultimately lead to meiotic nondisjunction and embryonic lethality. Interestingly, we find that defects in double-strand break initiation and crossover formation, but not pairing or synapsis, become even more severe in the germlines of older mutant animals, indicating an increased dependence on PPH- 4. 1 with increasing maternal age. Our results demonstrate that PPH- 4. 1 plays multiple, independent roles in <b>meiotic</b> prophase <b>chromosome</b> dynamics and maintaining meiotic competence in aging germlines.

40|$|Proper <b>meiotic</b> <b>chromosome</b> {{segregation}} in C. elegans requires homolog pairing, synapsis, and recombination. The mechanisms underlying homologous <b>chromosome</b> <b>pairing</b> remain poorly understood. In C. elegans, {{as in many}} other eukaryotes, pairing is accompanied by a global rearrangement of chromosomes. Work from the Dernburg lab and others has found that this rearrangement is driven through the association of special chromosome regions known as Pairing Centers (PCs) with nuclear envelope proteins and cytoskeletal components (Phillips et al. 2005, Sato et al. 2009). Using fluorescent markers for nuclear envelope attachment sites and Pairing Centers, I analyzed prophase chromosome dynamics through real-time imaging and quantitative motion tracking. My results reveal a dramatic increase in chromosome motion at the onset of <b>chromosome</b> <b>pairing</b> that persists after homologous loci are paired. I show that this increased mobility correlates with the formation of NE patches, and that the increase in motion that accompanies meiotic entry is abrogated by knockdown of cytoplasmic dynein. These rapid motions are also sensitive to depolymerization of microtubules by colchicine, but are not affected by treatment with Latrunculin A. In addition, fluorescent labeling of whole <b>chromosomes</b> suggests that <b>meiotic</b> <b>chromosome</b> motion is driven primarily by the PC end of chromosomes and that the chromosome is quite flexible. These data support a model in which <b>meiotic</b> <b>chromosome</b> motion is promoted by a small number of fast, microtubule-dependent, motor-driven movements that augment the smaller, likely diffusive motions seen prior to meiosis. The observation that fast motions persist well after pairing is completed suggests additional roles in chromosome synapsis or recombination, and are consistent with the idea that rapid motions function to destabilize inappropriate, non-homologous interactions...|$|R

In the absence of Ph 1, the distribution and frequencies of crossing over between the 1 A and 1 A m homoeologues were similar to the distribution and frequencies of crossing over between 1 A homologues. The cytogenetic and evolutionary significance of these findings is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The 49 North American wild Helianthus {{species have}} long survived extreme environments and possess {{resistance}} or tolerance genes to salt, drought, insects, diseases, {{as well as}} cytoplasmic male-sterility and fertility restoration, and are valuable genetic resources for sunflower improvement. Gene transfer from wild species into cultivated background depends {{on the success of}} interspecific hybridization, F 1 fertility, chromosome pairing for genetic recombination, efficient screening methods, and sufficient progenies for selection. Most wild annual species x sunflower crosses produce F 1 seeds and can be backcrossed easily. For the more difficult perennial x sunflower crosses where hybrid seed set is rare, a two-step embryo culture technique has been established for rescuing immature interspecific embryos prior to abor-tion. The chromosome homology between genomes of wild species and culti-vated sunflower is high, and the <b>meiotic</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>pairing</b> of wild diploid x cultivated F 1 is reasonably good, except for the multivalent formation, bridges, and fragments due to translocation and inversion differences.

40|$|Abstract] This {{protocol}} is a {{more detailed}} version of previous protocols (Yang et al., 2011; Bolaños-Villegas et al., 2013) developed for the examination of <b>meiotic</b> <b>chromosome</b> spreads. <b>Meiotic</b> <b>chromosome</b> spreads are useful to determine the presence of defects in <b>chromosome</b> <b>pairing</b> and segregation. The protocol also describes how to perform fluorescent in situ hybridization experiments with a centromere probe used to label chromosomes. Materials and Reagents 1. Inflorescences from young, healthy Arabidopsis thaliana plants 2. Agar plates, with 1 / 2 x Murashige and Skoog solid medium 3. Pectolyase (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: P 3026) 4. Cellulase (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: C 1184) 5. β-glucoronidase (Roche Diagnostics, catalog number: 03707598001) 6. Sucrose (Affymetrix, catalog number: 21938) 7.

40|$|A central {{event in}} sexual {{reproduction}} is {{the reduction in}} chromosome number that occurs at the meiosis I division. Most eukaryotes rely on crossing over between homologs, and the resulting chiasmata, to direct meiosis I chromosome segregation, yet make very few crossovers per <b>chromosome</b> <b>pair</b> [1] and [2]. This indicates that meiotic recombination must be tightly regulated to ensure that each <b>chromosome</b> <b>pair</b> enjoys the crossover necessary to ensure correct segregation. Here, we investigate control of meiotic crossing over in Caenorhabditis elegans, which averages only one crossover per <b>chromosome</b> <b>pair</b> per meiosis [3] and [4], by constructing genetic maps of end-to-end fusions of whole chromosomes. Fusion of chromosomes removes the requirement for a crossover in each component chromosome segment and thereby reveals a propensity to restrict the number of crossovers such that <b>pairs</b> of fusion <b>chromosomes</b> composed of two or even three whole chromosomes enjoy but a single crossover {{in the majority of}} meioses. This regulation can operate over physical distances encompassing half the genome. The meiotic behavior of heterozygous fusion chromosomes further suggests that continuous <b>meiotic</b> <b>chromosome</b> axes, or structures that depend on properly assembled axes, may be important for crossover regulation...|$|R
40|$|The Mozambique tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, {{is known}} to have an XX female/ XY male sex {{determination}} system. Analysis of the pachytene <b>meiotic</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in O. mossambicus and hybrids with Oreochromis niloticus demonstrated a region of diffuse lateral elements and differential staining in the long arm of bivalent 1 that was present only in heterogametic fish. Homology was also demonstrated between the <b>chromosome</b> <b>pair</b> 1 of O. niloticus (which has been previously demonstrated to be the sex chromosomes) and the same <b>chromosome</b> <b>pair</b> of O. mossambicus through fluorescent in situ hybridisation using probes prepared from the O. niloticus chromosome 1. This suggests that <b>chromosomes</b> in <b>pair</b> 1 are the sex chromosomes of the Mozambique tilapia. Meiotic gynogenetic progeny from O. mossambicus XY neofemales consisted of both YY and XY males but no females, in contrast to a previous study in which only YY male and XX female meiotic gynogenetics were produced in similar experiments. Autosomal genetic effects on sex determination were detected {{for the first time in}} this species...|$|R
