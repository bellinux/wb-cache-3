The average health expenditure depicts an impressive variability worldwide, with Americans being the top spenders and South East Asia countries being {{at the bottom of the}} respective list.

The competitive advantage of a business in the private <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> <b>market</b> is a result of a number of factors. The top three criteria of choice for a patient are doctors, medical technology and waiting time for accessing the service. The objectives of this research paper are: 1. to identify the key success factors (KSFs) and the drivers of change (DC) in the Romanian Medical Industry; 2. to propose a fine tuning in strategy as a response to changes in the macro and micro environment, 3. to re-evaluate existing business models and propose amendments that may lead to future sustainable competitive advantage and 4. to develop a proposition for growth strategies, business strategies and means of implementation that will lead to long term growth. </em...|$|E

A main finding {{of the study is}} that, following the introduction of health insurance in 1999, the newly introduced Sickness Funds have become the main players in the <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> <b>market,</b> introducing new bidding procedures and contracts for provision of medical services. Contracts, and negotiations which precede them, have introduced elements of market competition, which has affected the number and types of services provided by health care centers operating under a contract. The health financing reforms have led to an even playing field for public and non-public providers, marked by a proliferation of structurally smaller health units. The introduction of a market environment has changed the way in which providers are compensated, with a discernible shift away from salary-based systems to capitation and fee-for-service compensation.

This paper examines how upcoming health care reform aiming to increase insurance cov-erage a¤ects savings and welfare. I develop a heterogeneous-agent life-cycle model of insurance choice in which households face medical expenditure risk in addition to uninsurable income risk. The existence of an uninsured population reects limited liability in the <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> <b>market</b> and actuarially unfair premiums in the health insurance market. I estimate key structural parameters so that the model broadly repli-cates the joint distribution of insurance coverage by age, health, earnings and wealth across active participants in the individual insurance market. I then use the model to explore {{the implications of the}} A¤ordable Care Act which prohibits insurers from price-discriminating based on health risk and mandates the purchase of insurance.

Important directions of health care reform are optimization of management, rational distribution of limited financial resources, efficient use of material resources, introduction of health insurance, restructuring of treatment and preventive care to the people. Marketing of <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> <b>market</b> is one of the most complex types of marketing. Because it is medical services that are connected with the protection and maintenance of the most important values ​​of a person - life and health. The market for medical services is a combination of socio-economic relations in the healthcare sector. The most important components of the analysis of any market, including the market of medical services, are marketing research, which is a systematic collection, processing, analysis of data and information in order to formulate proposals for effective activities on it. In the field of public health, marketing can be defined as a complex process of planning, economic substantiation and management of the process of provision of medical services, the formation of a pricing policy of the medical-preventive process, ensuring effective communication with patients. The purpose of the study is to identify the health of the population and determine the demand factors for paid health services and their demand. The main task set before market research on the health {{of the population is}} the formation and provision of benefits to consumers that meet their needs for qualified medical care and quality of life. The research methods used in the work are based on probabilistic, stratified, quota, representative samples for the entire population of Ivano-Frankivsk and Ivano-Frankivsk region.

These efforts are directed at both the demand-side (patients and employers) and the supply-side (payers, physicians, clinical organizations), {{and the success of}} future reform relies on the evaluation of current and prior experiments to improve value. However, most of this experimentation has been piecemeal and voluntary, embedded in widely varied local environments usually characterized by competitive insurance, hospital, and <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> <b>markets.</b> So, while the Affordable Care Act of 2010 seeks to promote the most promising innovations, little is known generally about what the most effective supply-side strategies are, how ready payers and providers are to implement changes, or what policymakers should expect from ACA initiatives. This paper summarizes key points from an expert panel AcademyHealth convened to identify how the knowledge from existing research can inform policy development and implementation in this area. The meeting discussion covered a range of supply-side strategies to improve value, including: Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), bundled, capitated, and performancebased payment, and guideline- or education-based initiatives. During the meeting, the need for more precise performance measurement and better data emerged as key issues for successful payment reform efforts. Participants also noted that prior delivery system reform has largely occurred in receptive environments that were well-situated to implementing needed changes.

50|$|The {{history of}} the Indian <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> (IMS) dates back to 1612 when, on the {{formation}} of the East India Company, the Company appointed John Woodall as their first Surgeon General. Under him, medical Corps officers (mainly civilians) were recruited more or less on individual contracts. The company expanded activities in various part of the country which necessitated the formation and maintenance of regular bodies of troops in India. As a consequence, they commenced employing military surgeons from 1745 onwards. It was not until 1764 that these surgeons were made into regular establishment of the company’s armies. Thus the Bengal <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> was formed in 1764, the Madras <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> in 1767 and the Bombay <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> in 1779 for the three Presidency Armies of Bengal, Madras and Bombay. The three <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> were combined into the Indian <b>Medical</b> <b>Services</b> (IMS) in Apr 1886 under a Surgeon General to the Government of India. The designation was later changed into the Director General, Indian <b>Medical</b> <b>Service.</b> In 1913, the appointment was designated as the Director of <b>Medical</b> <b>Services</b> in India.|$|R
