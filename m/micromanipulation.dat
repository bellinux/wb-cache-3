This paper systematically studies the effects of visual feedback, posture and grip force on the trial error and tremor intensity of subjects holding a forceps-like object to perform a pointing task. Results indicate that: (i) Arm support improves accuracy in tasks requiring fine manipulation and reduces tremor intensity in the 2 - 8 Hz region, but hand support does not provide the same effect; hence freedom of wrist movement can be retained without {{a significant increase in}} trial error.

2500|$|A typical setup uses one laser {{to create}} one or two traps. Commonly, two traps are {{generated}} by splitting the laser beam into two orthogonally polarized beams. Optical tweezing operations with more than two traps can be realized either by time-sharing a single laser beam among several optical tweezers, or by diffractively splitting the beam into multiple traps. With acousto-optic deflectors or galvanometer-driven mirrors, a single laser beam can be shared among hundreds of optical tweezers in the focal plane, or else spread into an extended one-dimensional trap. Specially designed diffractive optical elements can divide a single input beam into hundreds of continuously illuminated traps in arbitrary three-dimensional configurations. The trap-forming hologram also can specify the mode structure of each trap individually, thereby creating arrays of optical vortices, optical tweezers, and holographic line traps, for example. When implemented with a spatial light modulator, such [...] also can move objects in three dimensions.

40|$|RNA {{secondary}} {{structures of}} increasing complexity are probed combining single molecule stretching experiments and stochastic unfolding/refolding simulations. We find that force-induced unfolding pathways cannot usually be interpretated by solely invoking successive openings of native helices. Indeed, typical force-extension responses of complex RNA molecules are largely shaped by stretching-induced, long-lived intermediates including non-native helices. This is first shown {{for a set}} of generic structural motifs found in larger RNA structures, and then for Escherichia coli's 1540 -base long 16 S ribosomal RNA, which exhibits a surprisingly well-structured and reproducible unfolding pathway under mechanical stretching. Using out-of-equilibrium stochastic simulations, we demonstrate that these experimental results reflect the slow relaxation of RNA structural rearrangements. Hence, <b>micromanipulations</b> of single RNA molecules probe both their native structures and long-lived intermediates, so-called "kinetic traps", thereby capturing -at the single molecular level- the hallmark of RNA folding/unfolding dynamics.

40|$|International audienceWhile axon {{fasciculation}} plays a {{key role}} in the development of neural networks, very little is known about its dynamics and the underlying biophysical mechanisms. In a model system composed of neurons grown ex vivo from explants of embryonic mouse olfactory epithelia, we observed that axons dynamically interact with each other through their shafts, leading to zippering and unzippering behaviour that regulates their fasciculation. Taking advantage of this new preparation suitable for studying such interactions, we carried out a detailed biophysical analysis of zippering, occurring either spontaneously or induced by <b>micromanipulations</b> and pharmacological treatments. We show that zippering arises from the competition of axon-axon adhesion and mechanical tension in the axons, and provide the first quantification of the force of axon-axon adhesion. Furthermore, we introduce a biophysical model of the zippering dynamics, and we quantitatively relate the individual zipper properties to global characteristics of the developing axon network.

40|$|Abstract — In recent years, {{biological}} <b>micromanipulations</b> {{emerge as}} a promising application in the micro/nano technology. Manual manipulation tends to have disadvantages of low suc-cess rate and low repeatability. In order to perform the robotic biomanipulations, a novel flexure-based Y θ large-workspace micromanipulator with differential lever displacement amplifier (DLDA) is proposed in this paper. After a series of optimal designs and mechanism modeling, the mechanism performance of the proposed micromanipulator is validated by using the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) method. Finally, the proposed micromanipulator is fabricated and closed-loop experimentally tested to make a prototype characterization. In this study, two piezoelectric (PZT) actuators P- 216. 80 with closed-loop travel 120 µm and closed-loop resolution 2. 4 nm are employed, the simulation and experimentally {{results indicate that the}} mechanism displacement amplification ratio can reach up to 31, thus the maximum output displacement can achieve around 3. 3 mm, the rotation angle can reach up to around 26. 5 ◦.

40|$|Pulse laser {{was used}} because it permits microdestructive {{processes}} {{to occur in}} the cell. Blepharisma and Paramecium cells responded to its destructive action in a different way, as demonstrated by vidoe recording. While Paramecium cells showed marked contraction of wound edges, Blepharisma reacted in a less pronounced way. This can be due to a different organization of the cortical cytoskeleton. In addition, Blepharisma cells contain blepharismin, a specific red pigment, that is probably responsible for a higher absorption of laser light that produces more serious damage. Blepharisma cells may survive without detectable damage even after destruction of the whole apical end. In these experiments we found out that the damage caused by laser stimulates cell proliferation. Our experiments provided evidence that <b>micromanipulations</b> and destructive changes facilitated by laser tweezers have a wide scope of application in cell biology, such as studies of mechanical properties of cytoskeletal structures or spatial arrangement of the cell interior, with a possibility of mapping distribution of its individual cell components.

40|$|In this paper, {{classified}} theoretical models, {{consisting of}} contact with and placement of microsphere and picking operations, are simplified and established to depict the interactive behaviors of external and internal forces in pushing manipulations, respectively. Sliding and/or rolling cases, resulting in the acceleration of <b>micromanipulations,</b> are discussed in detail. Effective contact detection is achieved by combining alterations of light-shadow and relative movement displacement between the tip-sphere. Picking operations are investigated by typical interactive positions and different end tilt angles. Placements are realized by adjusting the proper end tilt angles. These were separately conducted to explore the interactive operations of nonconductive glass microspheres in a scanning electron microscope. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed contact detection method can efficiently protect the end-tip from damage, regardless of operator skills in initial positioning operations.

40|$|International audienceToxoplasma gondii is {{a common}} {{parasite}} of humans and animals, which is transmitted via oocysts in cat faeces or tissue cysts in contaminated meat. The robust oocyst and sporocyst walls protect the infective sporozoites from deleterious external attacks including disinfectants. Upon oocyst acquisition, these walls lose their integrity to let the sporozoites excyst and invade host cells following a process that remains poorly understood. Given {{the resistance of the}} oocyst wall to digestive enzymes and the ability of oocysts to cause parenteral infections, the present study investigated the possible contribution of macrophages in supporting sporozoite excystation following oocyst internalisation. By using single cell <b>micromanipulations,</b> real-time and time-point imaging techniques, we demonstrated that RAW macrophages could interact rapidly with oocysts and engulfed them by remodelling of their actin cytoskeleton. Internalised oocysts were associated to macrophage acidic compartments and showed evidences of wall disruption. Sporozoites were observed in macrophages containing oocyst remnants or in new macrophages, giving rise to dividing tachyzoites. All together, these results highlight an unexpected role of phagocytic cells in processing T. gondii oocysts, in line with non-classical routes of infection, and open new perspectives to identify chemical factors that lead to oocyst wall disruption under physiological conditions...|$|R

In [32] we emphasized that, in contrast to a standard configuration based on linear actuators, a mechanism with actuator design inspired from an anthropological kinematic structure offers relatively a larger motion envelope and higher dexterity making it a viable motion platform for <b>micromanipulations.</b> After having described the basic design and kinematic analysis of our motion platform in [32], we now aim to propose an advanced motion cueing algorithm for facilitating the identification of inertial parameters at micron&# 8208;level.

Methods: An in vitro cross-sectional study was undertaken using CBA F 1 mouse zygotes exposed to ambient air at 37. 0  °C for 3, 5, and 8  min daily during their entire in vitro development. Blastocysts were analyzed for total cell numbers, apoptosis, and H 19 and Igf 2 expression and transferred to pseudopregnant recipient females to examine pregnancy, fetal and placental weight, and placental H 19 and Igf 2 expression. Results: Short exposure of pre-implantation embryos to ambient air at 37. 0  °C resulted in a statistically significant reduction in blastocyst development and total cell numbers, increased apoptotic cell index, and impaired H 19 and Igf 2 expression in the blastocyst. Implantation rates were significantly reduced and fetuses and placentae displayed a significant reduced weight on day 18 of pregnancy.
