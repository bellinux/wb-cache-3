40|$|International audienceBone morphogenic {{proteins}} (BMPs) promote mesenchymal {{stem cell}} (MSC) osteogenic differentiation, whereas platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) activate their proliferation through receptors tyrosine kinase (RTK). The effects of PDGF or FGF receptor signaling pathway on BMP 2 -induced osteoblastic differentiation was investigated in human MSC (HMSC). Inhibition of PDGF or/and FGF receptors enhanced BMP 2 -induced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, expression of Osterix, ALP and Bone sialoprotein, and matrix calcification. These effects were associated with increased Smad- 1 activity, indicating that <b>mitogenic</b> <b>factors</b> interfere with Smad signaling in HMSC differentiation. RTK activate MAPK and inhibit GSK 3 through the PI 3 K/Akt pathway.

40|$|Myelinating Schwann cells (SCs) {{are highly}} plastic {{cells that are}} able to dedifferentiate and {{re-enter}} the cell cycle. However, the molecular signals controlling dedifferentiation are not completely understood. Because a connection between mitogenic signaling and myelin loss has been suggested, we investigated the role of cAMP, a strong inducer of the myelinating phenotype, and <b>mitogenic</b> <b>factors</b> activating receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) on SC dedifferentiation. We herein provide evidence indicating that cAMP was required to not only initiate but also maintain a state of differentiation because SCs rapidly dedifferentiated and became competent to resume proliferation upon the removal of cAMP stimulation. Surprisingly, isolated SCs could undergo multiple cycles of differentiation and dedifferentiation upon cAMP addition and removal, respectively, in the absence of <b>mitogenic</b> <b>factors</b> and without entering the cell cycle. Conversely, the activation of RTKs and the ERK cascade by a variety of growth factors, including neuregulin, was not sufficient to initiate dedifferentiation in the presence of cAMP. Importantly, a reduction of cAMP triggered dedifferentiation through a mechanism that required JNK, rather than ERK, activity and an induction of the expression of c-Jun, a transcriptional inhibitor of myelination. In summary, the reversible transition from an undifferentiated to a myelinating state was dependent on cAMP but independent of RTK signaling and cell cycle progression, further indicating that dedifferentiation and proliferation are uncoupled and differentially regulated events in SCs...|$|R

40|$|NoBACKGROUND: Androgenetic alopecia, or male pattern baldness, is a common, {{progressive}} disorder where large, terminal scalp hairs {{are gradually}} replaced by smaller hairs in precise patterns until only tiny vellus hairs remain. This balding {{can cause a}} marked reduction {{in the quality of}} life. Although these changes are driven by androgens, most molecular mechanisms are unknown, limiting available treatments. The mesenchyme-derived dermal papilla {{at the base of the}} mainly epithelial hair follicle controls the type of hair produced and is probably the site through which androgens act on follicle cells by altering the regulatory paracrine factors produced by dermal papilla cells. During changes in hair size the relationship between the hair and dermal papilla size remains constant, with alterations in both dermal papilla volume and cell number. This suggests that alterations within the dermal papilla itself play a key role in altering hair size in response to androgens. Cultured dermal papilla cells offer a useful model system to investigate this as they promote new hair growth in vivo, retain characteristics in vitro which reflect their parent follicle's response to androgens in vivo and secrete <b>mitogenic</b> <b>factors</b> for dermal papilla cells and keratinocytes. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether cultured dermal papilla cells from balding follicles secrete altered amounts/types of <b>mitogenic</b> <b>factors</b> for dermal papilla cells than those from larger, normal follicles. We also aimed to determine whether rodent cells would recognize mitogenic signals from human cells in vitro and whether factors produced by balding dermal papilla cells could alter the start of a new mouse hair cycle in vivo. METHODS: Dermal papilla cells were cultured from normal, balding and almost clinically normal areas of balding scalps and their ability to produce <b>mitogenic</b> <b>factors</b> compared using both human and rat whisker dermal papilla cells as in vitro targets and mouse hair growth in vivo. RESULTS: Normal scalp cells produced soluble factors which stimulated the growth of both human scalp and rat whisker dermal papilla cells in vitro, demonstrating dose-responsive mitogenic capability across species. Although balding cells stimulated some growth, this was much reduced and they also secreted inhibitory factor(s). Balding cell media also delayed new hair growth when injected into mice. CONCLUSIONS: Human balding dermal papilla cells secrete inhibitory factors which affect the growth of both human and rodent dermal papilla cells and factors which delay the onset of anagen in mice in vivo. These inhibitory factor(s) probably cause the formation of smaller dermal papillae and smaller hairs in male pattern baldness. Identification of such factor(s) could lead to novel therapeutic approaches...|$|R
