25|$|Tallgrass prairies {{are found}} in the {{southern}} and eastern section of the great plains. It once covered 170 <b>million</b> <b>acres</b> <b>in</b> North America. Now, less than 4% remains, mostly in the Kansas Flint Hills. This area is lower and wetter than the High Plains and is warmer than many other regions. Some areas here receive more than 40 inches of annual precipitation. Grasses here include bluestems, along with many other species. Historically, many areas of the Midwest that are now forested were once tallgrass prairie. Fire is very important in maintaining the prairie. Without it, many areas can become forested.|$|E

Tribes seeking settlements had to file claims by August 1961, and both the Oklahoma and Florida Seminoles did so. After combining their claims, the Commission awarded the Seminole a total of $16 million on April 1976. It had established that, {{at the time of the}} 1823 Treaty of Moultrie Creek, the Seminole exclusively occupied and used 24 <b>million</b> <b>acres</b> <b>in</b> Florida, which they ceded under the treaty. Assuming that most blacks in Florida were escaped slaves, the United States did not recognize the Black Seminoles as legally members of the tribe, nor as free in Florida under Spanish rule. Although the Black Seminoles also owned or controlled land that was seized in this cession, they were not acknowledged in the treaty.|$|E

Production of cotton was reported at a record high of 15 million bales of 470 lbs each {{in the form of}} phutti (seed cotton) during 2014–15; this [...] was an 11% increase compared to the previous season (2013–14). Its phenomenal growth was from 1.38 million bales in 1961 to 11.138 million bales in 2014, with the estimated 2014–15 figures showing a further increase to 15 million bales. Between 1980–81 and 1990–91, the growth in production was rapid, with production rising from 0.70 million to 2.2 million tonnes, which was called the [...] "magic year" [...] of Pakistan's cotton industry. This was attributed to better pest control measures, use of improved seed types and increased use of fertilisers. The cotton and textile industries are integrated and account for 1,000 ginneries, 425 textile mills, and 300 cottonseed crushers and oil refiners. Cotton hybrids, created by crossing the Bt gene into traditional varieties, have been developed by local firms dealing with seeds.

It also provided for more acreage to be designated as wilderness for preservation. In defining wilderness, Zahniser invoked Marshall and his contemporaries, stating that [...] "in contrast with those areas where man and his own works dominate the landscape, [...] is hereby recognized as an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain." [...] The act's signing was the most important event in the history of The Wilderness Society; members Mardy Murie and Alice Zahniser stood beside Johnson as he signed the legislation. [...] With the Wilderness Act, the United States guaranteed permanent protection of wild and scenic natural areas for future generations. [...] The Society's most prestigious honor, the Robert Marshall Award, is named in Marshall's honor; its first recipient was Sigurd F. Olson in 1981.|$|E

On March 16, Williams, Durst and Grant proposed to buy the four hundred leagues themselves, before the land went on sale to the public. Grant also gave Williams his power of attorney in the sales. The appearance of conflict of interest angered many.|$|E
