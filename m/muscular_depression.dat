40|$|The {{statement}} made by Sollmann (1) that quinine; quinidine, cinchonine, and cinchonidine produce <b>muscular</b> <b>depression</b> with dilute {{solutions and}} toxic rigor with more concentrated solutions is apparently based mainly upon work done with isolated nerve-muscle preparations of the frog. Piccinini (2, 3) investigated {{the effects of}} quinine on the frog nerve-muscle preparation {{and also in the}} intact frog. He reported that small doses increased the muscle response. Smith and Fantus (4) working with frogs reported that the tetanus response to nerve faradization was changed to a single twitch response after quinine, although the muscle still responded fully to direct stimulation. Vondracek (5) ran ergographic and dynamometer experiments on a group of soldiers and concluded that quinine increased the muscle work not so much through direct muscle action but through action on the central nervous mechanism. The recent report of Kolb, Harvey and Whitehall (6) in which quinine sulphate abolished the myotonus of myotonia atrophica but had no effect on mus-cular strength indicates that in the myotonic patient no depression ‘Since the preparation of this article, an abstract in the proceedings of the xvi International Physiological Congresses on The Actions of Quinine on Skeletal Muscle by A.

40|$|The {{most common}} site of origin for right {{ventricular}} outflow tract (RVOT) tachycardias is the left septal {{side of the}} infundibulum just underneath the pulmonary valve (PV). Detailed anatomic information of this ventricular structure {{may be useful to}} perform the ablation techniques more efficiently and safely. Twenty-five structurally normal human hearts (18 m, 47 ± 5 years) were carefully dissected. The RVOT tract region was defined superiorly by the PV and inferiorly by the superior margin of the RV inflow tract. The interventricular septum and the RV free wall constitute its medial and lateral aspects, respectively. We distinguished 3 morphological areas within the RVOT: 1) the septal part that contacts with the outflow of the left ventricle, 2) the left septo-parietal (LSP) and 3) the right septoparietal (RSP) parts which extend from the septal portion to the anterior wall of the infundibulum. The septomarginal trabeculation (SMT), is a muscle strap plastered onto the septal part. The septo-parietal trabeculations take origin from the anterior margin of the SMT and run round the parietal quadrant of the endocardial infundibulum. These trabeculations showed a variable extension (between 5 to 22 trabeculations) and thickness (range 2 - 10 mm) along the right and left septo-parietal wall of the RVOT. The more prominent and thicker trabeculations were found in the LSP part. We found in 80 % of the hearts a deep <b>muscular</b> <b>depression</b> (cleft) between the septal and the LSP parts. This cleft is crossed by thick trabeculations forming holes or pits of variable depth (5 - 10 mm). In conclusion, the variable arrangement and thickness of the septoparietal trabeculations of the infundibulum are anatomic features of clinical relevance during endocardial ablation of the RVOT. 10. 052 JCR (2010) Q 1, 3 / 114 Cardiac & cardiovascular system...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{community-based}} participatory research {{was to understand the}} employment-health association for immigrant/refugee women from Korea, Asia, Africa, Japan, Arab world and Latin America (KAAJAL) in Grand Erie –a mid-sized urban/rural region in Ontario, Canada. The study utilized photovoice –a visual qualitative research methodology in which participants were given cameras to record their experiences. Intersectionality analysis of 525 participant-generated photographs, diaries, and in-depth interviews of twenty women revealed that various markers of difference such as nationality (i. e. native or foreign-born), immigrant status (i. e. family class sponsorship), geography (i. e. rural or urban residence), socio-economic status, sexuality, age, ability and race intersected to influence women’s health and employment experiences.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{explored}} symptoms, attitudes and treatments surrounding women's health and menopause among the Q'eqchi Maya {{of the eastern}} tropical lowlands of Guatemala. Data were obtained through participant observation, semi-structured interviews, focus groups and plant walks with 50 Q'eqchi community members {{from the state of}} Izabal, Municipality of Livingston, including five midwives, five traditional male healers and eight postmenopausal women. Results indicate that the Q'eqchi Maya of Livingston possess their own cultural perceptions of women's health which affect attitudes, symptoms and treatment choices during the menopausal transition. Since discussions of menstruation and menopause are considered cultural taboos among the Q'eqchi, many women mentioned experiencing excessive preoccupation when unanticipated and unfamiliar symptoms occurred. Furthermore, many women suffered from additional hardship when their spouse misinterpreted menopausal symptoms (vaginal dryness, sexual disinterest) as infidelity. Seven of the eight postmenopausal women interviewed indicated experiencing one or more symptoms during the menopausal transition, including headaches, anxiety, <b>muscular</b> pain, <b>depression,</b> and hot flashes. These results differ from the lack of symptomatology reported in previous studies in Mexico, but are in line with the result of menopausal research conducted among other Maya groups from the highlands of Guatemala. Although the Q'eqchi did not use a specific term for "hot flash", three Q'eqchi women used the expression "baja presion" or a "lowering of blood pressure" to explain symptoms of profuse sweating followed by chills, heart palpitations, and emotional instability. The Q'eqchi Maya mentioned a number of herbal remedies to treat menopausal symptoms.

40|$|Indexación: Scopus; Scielo. Background: Frailty is a {{geriatric}} syndrome {{characterized by}} a progressive impairment in the subjects’ {{ability to respond to}} environmental stress. Frailty is more commonly found in heart failure (HF) patients than in general population and it is an independent predictor of rehospitalization, emergency room visits and death. Aim: To estimate the prevalence of frailty in patients with decompensated HF admitted to four hospitals in Santiago, Chile. Material and Methods: Cross-sectional study. Subjects aged 60 or older consecutively admitted for decompensated HF to the study centers between August 2014 and March 2015 were included. Frailty was defined as the presence of three {{or more of the following}} criteria: unintended weight loss, <b>muscular</b> weakness, <b>depression</b> symptoms (exhaustion), reduced gait speed and low physical activity. Independent variables were tested for association using simple logistic regression. Variables associated with frailty (p < 0. 05) were included in a multiple logistic regression model. Results: Seventy-nine subjects were included. The prevalence of frailty was 50. 6 %. Frail patients were mostly female (52. 6 %) and older than non-frail subjects (73. 7 ± 7. 9 vs 68. 2 ± 7. 1; p < 0. 003). Independent predictors of frailty were age (Odds raio (OR) 1. 10; 95 % confidence intervals (CI) : 1. 03 - 1. 17), quality of life measured with the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (OR 1. 07; IC 95 %: 1. 03 - 1. 11), previous hospitalizations (OR 2. 56; 95 %CI: 1. 02 - 6. 43) and number of medications (OR 4. 46; 95 %CI: 1. 11 - 17. 32). Conclusions: The prevalence of frailty in patients admitted to the hospital for decompensated heart failure is high.

The disease occurred in June-July 2006 on a farm located in the county of Encruzilhada do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Although there were 11 cattle in the same paddock, {{none of them was}} affected. High numbers of compact masses containing up to 150 larvae were scattered in the paddock where the animals were grazing. Most affected sheep showed severe apathy during 24 - 36 h before death, but weakness, <b>muscular</b> tremors and <b>depression</b> were also observed. Necropsy was performed on six sheep and the main macroscopic lesions were hemorrhages in the subcutaneous tissues, endocardium, gallbladder wall, and abomasal mucosa. In all animals was found hydrothorax, hydropericardium, ascites, and mild jaundice. Edema in the abomasal folds, mesentery, perirenal tissues, and gallbladder wall were also seen. The livers were yellowish with disseminated pinpoint hemorrhages in the parenchyma and had an enhanced lobular pattern. Perreyia flavipes larval body fragments and heads were found in the forestomach contents of the six sheep. Feces were scant, dry and formed balls coated by mucus and streaks of blood.

40|$|A {{peculiar}} form of illness, {{called in}} English “mountain sickness,” {{has been known}} for centuries to affect persons who have to pass over or ascend high mountains. The usual symptoms of this illness are nausea, vomiting and headache, with much loss of <b>muscular</b> power, and <b>depression.</b> It has also been known for long that only newcomers are attacked, since inhabitants of high altitudes, or persons visiting them frequently, are “acclimatised. ” Until the investigations of Paul Bert, summarised in his well-known book La pression barombtrique, 1878, the essential cause of mountain sickness was unknown; and even in much more recent times the cause continued to be wholly misunderstood, even by prominent physiologists such as Moss 0 and Kronecker. Paul Bert’s experiments, made partly on animals, and partly on himself in a steel chamber, showed con-clusively that whatever other conditions may contribute to the produc-tion of mountain sickness, the essential cause is diminution in the partial pressure or concentration of oxygen in the air inspired. At high altitudes this partial pressure is reduced along with the reduction in total atmospheric pressure, though the percentage composition of the air is exactly the same at high altitudes as at sea-level. If the lowering of the oxygen pressure is prevented by adding pure oxygen to the air the lowering of barometric pressure has no effect. Acclimatisation to high altitudes is thus acclimatisation to an ab-normally low partial pressure of oxygen in the air breathed, and the present paper deals with {{the manner in which the}} acclimatisation is brought about. The subject is still one of pretty acute controversy among physiologists, though there is now general agreement that Paul Bert’s experiments were conclusive as to the real cause of moun-tain sickness. There is also now general agreement that the low oxygen pressur...|$|R
40|$|IT IS {{customary}} {{to speak}} of a normal concentration of calcium or of inorganic phosphorus in serum, and if normal individuals subsisting on a well balanced diet are chosen the concentration of these components in serum will be found to be singularly constant (1). Thus, the serum calcium concentration of normal infants free from clinical or x-ray evi dence of rickets or of clinical evidence of tetany is found to be 10 Â± 1 mg. per 100 cc. of serum, while the inorganic phosphorus is 5 + 0. 5 mg. Measur able deviations from the normal have been found in disease and may be sustained {{over a long period of}} time but where such deviations are marked, clinical symptoms soon appear and in some instances are characteristic of the particular inorganic deficiency. A marked decrease in serum calcium has been observed in infantile (2) and parathyroid (3) tetany and in chronic nephritis, particularly the type designated as nephrosclerosis (4). In cases of chronic parenchymatous nephritis with edema and low serum protein there is a parallelism between the reduction in serum protein and in serum calcium (5). A moderate decrease of serum calcium may follow operations on the thyroid gland and has been ascribed to incidental damage to the parathyroids (6). Reductions in serum calcium concentra tion have been reported in rickets without tetany (7), in osteomalacia (8), in coeliac disease (9), in sprue (10), and recently, in pneumonia (11). Transient increases in serum calcium may be produced in normal in dividuals or animals by the oral administration of large amounts of soluble calcium salts or the intravenous injection of smaller amounts (12).

40|$|A {{double-blind}} {{study of the}} effects of diazepam as an adjuvant to propanidid anaes-thesia for legal abortion has shown that the incidence of nausea and vomiting was significandy reduced as a result of giving diazepam, and that, in general, the conditions of anaesthesia were more acceptable widi diazepam. The diazepam group had a pro-longation of the time to recovery of consciousness but this was not considered unacceptable. Diazepam has continued to attract the interest of anaesthetists since its introduction in 1961 (Randall et al., 1961) and its use in anaesthesia has been reviewed by Dundee and Haslett (1970). Although the drug is seldom indicated as the sole anaesthetic agent, it is useful as an adjuvant to many types of intravenous and inhalation anaesthesia. Diazepam has few undesirable cardiovascular effects (Stovner and Endresen, 1966). Bradycardia occurs occasion-ally but is prevented readily by atropine. There are great individual variations in the response to the drug and in the dose required to induce sleep (Brown and Dundee, 1968). In addition, it has been noted that patients premedicated with opiates may become apnoeic as a result of <b>muscular</b> hypotonia and <b>depression</b> of the respiratory centre (Hunter, 1967). Propanidid is widely used as an ultra-short acting anaesthetic (Wynards and Burfoot, 1965). In clinical use the drug causes characteristic changes in the respiratory pattern; a period of initial hyperventila-tion being followed by a period of hypoventilation (Harnick, 1964). In the series of Wynards and Bur-foot the incidence of nausea with or without vomit-ing was 30 %, but this may have been partially die result of the other drugs employed in their method of anaesthesia. These authors also observed a decrease in arterial pressure in 89 % of their patients. Since 1965 we have used propanidid as the sole anaesthetic for short procedures (Manila, Hakalehto and Babinski, 1966). However, in some patients, the duration of its effect has been too short and supple-mentary doses have been required. On occasions unco-ordinated movements by the patient have bee...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the haematological parameters {{and assess the}} comparatively mild, moderate and severe effects of trypanosomiasis and ancylostomiasis on local dog breeds. Methods: Diagnosis of trypanosomiasis was based on clinical signs and presence of Trypanosoma congolense in wet mount of infected animals. Diagnosis of ancylostomiasis was based on clinical signs and presence of Ancylostoma caninum eggs in fecal samples. Fecal samples were examined using modified McMaster technique. Haematological parameters assessed were packed cell volume (PCV), haemoglobin concentration (HbC), total leucocyte counts and differential leucocyte counts. Results: The severity of anaemia produced was graded into mild, moderate and severe. The infected dogs with mild trypanosomiasis and ancylostomiasis had slightly elevated temperatures. Other symptoms observed included dullness, <b>depression,</b> <b>muscular</b> weakness and pale mucous membranes. The infected dogs with mild ancylostomiasis also showed anorexia. The mean PCV and HbC values for mild infections with T. congolense and A. caninum were significantly (P < 0. 05) {{lower than those of}} normal dogs. The mean total WBC counts for both mild trypanosomiasis and ancylostomiasis were within the normal range when compared with the values for normal dogs. In all the cases of trypanosomiasis and ancylostomiasis, the total differential counts of monocytes were significantly (P < 0. 05) lower than the normal values. There were obvious clinical signs such as pyrexia, anaemia, enlarged lymph nodes, subcutaneous oedema and occasional ophthalmitis for most of the dogs with severe trypanosomiasis. The mean PCV and HbC values of severe trypanosomiasis and ancylostomiasis were significantly lower than the normal values and also lower than all other cases of the disease condition. Anaemia was associated with both disease conditions but more severe in acute cases of trypanosomiasis. Conclusions: This study shows that dogs in this area are at risk of trypanosome infection all the year round, although the incidence of infection is the highest during the rainy season. Understanding on the causes of the changes in the composition of the blood in mixed infections of trypanosomiasis and ancylostomiasis is necessary...|$|R

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a retrospective cohort study, 199 subjects who had serologically confirmed CHIKV infection (CHIK+) were compared with 199 sero-negative subjects (CHIK-) matched for age, gender and area of residence in La Réunion Island. Following an average time of 17 months from the acute phase of infection, participants were interviewed by telephone about current symptoms, medical consumption during the last 12 months and quality of life assessed by the 12 -items Short-Form Health Survey (SF- 12) scale. At the time of study, 112 (56 %) CHIK+ persons reported they were fully recovered. CHIK+ complained more frequently than CHIK- of arthralgia (relative risk = 1. 9; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 6 - 2. 2), myalgia (1. 9; 1. 5 - 2. 3), fatigue (2. 3; 1. 8 - 3), depression (2. 5; 1. 5 - 4. 1) and hair loss (3. 8; 1. 9 - 7. 6).

40|$|It was {{previously}} {{generally agreed that}} a mechanical train-of-four (TOF) ratio > 0. 70 represented an adequate recovery of respiratory function after neuromuscular blockade. Normal respiratory parameters at this level of recovery and during air breathing support this view. We doubted whether this level of recovery also {{was associated with a}} normal response to hypercarbic or hypoxic challenge. The aim of the first study was to investigate the influence of a partial neuromuscular block on the ventilatory responses to hypercarbia and hypoxemia. We found that a vecuronium-induced partial neuromuscular block, corresponding to a TOF-ratio of 0. 70 is associated with a normal resting ventilation and ventilatory response to hypercarbia while a marked reduction in the ventilatory response to hypoxaemia was found. We conclude that a mechanical TOF ratio of 0. 70 following vecuronium is associated with an inadequate ventilatory response to hypoxaemia These findings, and the theory that they were caused by an interaction between vecuronium and the normal response to hypoxemia at the peripheral chemoreceptors of the carotid body, lead to our second study. Here we studied the effects of close carotid body injections of vecuronium on phrenic nerve activity, at different states of oxygenation, in anaesthetised and mechanically ventilated adult rabbits. A close carotid body injection of vecuronium reduced the hypoxia-induced increase in phrenic nerve activity. We conclude that this was most likely caused by a vecuronium-induced depression of carotid body chemosensitivity, but that further investigations were necessary to confirm this hypothesis. To elucidate whether this reduced response to hypoxic challenge was caused by an effect of Vecuronium on the peripheral chemo receptors, and not by a central effect, we designed a third study. This time we excluded central regulation by directly recording single fibre sinus nerve activity. The effect of systemic administration of vecuronium on a single fibre preparation of the carotid sinus nerve, was studied in seven mechanically ventilated rabbits. Our findings showed that systemic administration of vecuronium reversibly depresses the chemoreceptor function of the carotid body as measured on a single fibre afferent chemoreceptor preparation during hypoxia. We conclude that vecuronium, in addition to <b>muscular</b> paralysis, causes <b>depression</b> of carotid body chemoreceptor function during hypoxia and that the depression recovers spontaneously To further demonstrate that the reduction in chemoreceptor activity observed in the previous experiments was being caused by an effect of the neuromuscular blocking agent on the peripheral receptor it was necessary to completely isolate the carotid body and sinus nerve {{from the rest of the}} organism. An isolated carotid body preparation with adjacent sinus nerve was used. N icotine- induced carotid body responses were significantly depressed by the neuromuscular blocking agents vecuronium and atracurium. Increased dose caused an increased depression. We conclude that atracurium and vecuronium depress ni cotine- induced chemoreceptor responses of the carotid body in a dose dependent manner and note that equipotent neuromuscular blocking concentrations give rise to a similar degree of chemoreceptor depression. Our findings have contributed to a change in attitude towards the clinical consequences of residual neuromuscular block. A TOF ratio of >= 0. 90 is now recommended for safe extubation, at which levels our research indicates that the hypoxic ventilatory response has recovered...|$|R
