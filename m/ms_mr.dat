Oh Land described CSS's remix as [...] "more club and minimal" [...] and compared its sound {{to the music}} of the 1980s. Reflecting on all six of the remixes, Oh Land claimed that she only asked musicians that she [...] "really admire" [...] to create the mixes. She then stated that she enjoyed listening to what the different musicians could create from her music.|$|E

6000|$|A great living author, who had {{a decent}} regard for his own works, could never have made or passed this slovenly Folio. Yet Mr. Greenwood argues that {{probably}} Bungay was still alive and active, after Shakspere was dead and buried. (Mr. Greenwood, of course, does not speak of Bungay, which I use as short for his Great Unknown.) Thus, Richard III from 1597 to 1622 appeared in six quartos. It is immensely improved in the Folio, and so are several other plays. Who made the improvements, which the Editors could only obtain in manuscripts? If we say that Shakespeare made them in <b>MS.,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Greenwood asks, [...] "What had he to work upon, since, after selling his plays to his company, he did not preserve his manuscript?" [...] {216a} Now I {{do not know that}} he did sell his plays to his company. We are sure that Will got money for them, but {{we do not know what}} arrangement he made with his company. He may have had an author's rights in addition to a sum down, as later was customary, and he had his regular share in the profits. Nor am I possessed of information that [...] "he did not preserve his manuscript." [...] How can we know that? He may have kept his first draft, he may have made a fair copy for himself, as well as for the players, or may have had one made. He may have worked on a copy possessed by the players; and the publisher of the quartos of 1605, 1612, 1622, may not have been allowed to use, or may not have asked for the latest manuscript revised copy. The Richard III of the Folio contains, with much new matter, the printer's errors of the quarto of 1622. I would account for this by supposing that the casual Editor had just sense enough to add the new parts in a revised manuscript to the quarto, and was far too lazy to correct the printer's errors in the quarto. But Mr. Greenwood asks whether [...] "the natural conclusion is not that 'some person unknown' took the Quarto of 1622, revised it, added the new passages, and thus put it into the form in which it appeared in 1623." [...] This natural conclusion means that the author, Bungay, was alive in 1622, and put his additions and improvements of recent date into the quarto of 1622, but never took the trouble to correct the errors in the quarto. And so on in other plays similarly treated. [...] "Is it not a more natural conclusion that 'Shakespeare'" [...] (Bungay) [...] "himself revised its publication, and that some part of this revision, at any rate, was done after 1616 and before 1623." [...] {217a} ...|$|E
