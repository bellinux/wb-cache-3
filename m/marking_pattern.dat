Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses, aspect and mood, as well as passive constructions, interrogatives and some negation. Despite noticeable variation among the accents and dialects of English used in different countries and regions – in terms of phonetics and phonology, and sometimes also vocabulary, grammar and spelling – English-speakers from around the world are able to communicate with one another with relative ease.|$|E

50|$|In construction, a verb {{is always}} prefixed and suffixed by Subject and Object (agreement) markers, which {{respectively}} mark the Undergoer and Actor {{of the action}} referred to by the verb. In the case of transitive verbs, the subject markers are suffixed to the verb root (cf. nominative suffixes), while the object markers are prefixed (cf. absolutive prefixes). In the case of intransitive verbs, the subject is marked via {{the same set of}} prefixes which serve as object markers with transitive verbs (i.e. the Undergoer of the transitive verb is specified by the same set of prefixes as the Actor of the intransitive verb; ergo ‘absolutive prefixes’); in addition, an invariant nominative suffix is attached to the verb root. Another <b>marking</b> <b>pattern</b> is observed with derived intransitive verbs. Here a detransitivising prefix is added to the transitive verb root and the transitive subject markers are also used as intransitive subject markers (i.e. the Actors of transitive and derived intransitive verbs are marked by the same set of suffixes; ergo ‘nominative suffixes’). Hence Boevé & Boevé (1999: 15)’s remark on the hybrid nature of (what they call) “the verbal case-marking system”: when tracing the A/O and S marking of transitive and (inherently) intransitive verbs, the <b>marking</b> <b>pattern</b> is ergative-absolutive; when comparing the <b>marking</b> <b>pattern</b> of transitive and derived intransitive verbs, the pattern is nominative-accusative.|$|E

50|$|Seven bit {{characters}} have {{the alternative to}} be sent erect, meaning that 0 stays as 0 and 1 stays as 1, or inverted where each 0 changes to 1 and 1 changes to 0. The standard specifies a <b>marking</b> <b>pattern</b> which says which characters are erect and which are inverted in a particular pattern, that enables the system phase, channel and subchannel to be determined. Since the system is synchronous there is no start bit, and a receiver has to examine the bit stream to tell where {{the start of a}} marked cycle is. When system phase is established the correct received bit can be assigned to the correct place in each character in each channel. The receiver can determine that system phase is established as each character will contain three one bits and four zero bits. In recommendation 342-2 here are two different marking lengths schemes. For the four character repetition cycle, Channel A is encoded ↓↑↑↑ (4333) and channel B is marked ↑↓↓↓ (3444).
