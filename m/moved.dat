5|$|A {{cold front}} <b>moved</b> southeastward from the East Coast of the United States on December 23, 1954, and passed over Bermuda two days later. A strong {{anticyclone}} developed behind the cold front, and on December 26 a trough extended southward {{from the cold}} front. The anticyclone <b>moved</b> southeastward as the trough and cold front <b>moved</b> eastward. The trough gradually decelerated as high pressures altered the upper level flow to that of an easterly flow. Convection increased over the trough as it <b>moved</b> over relatively warm waters, about 1 °C above normal, and began undergoing tropical cyclogenesis after a circulation began to develop along the northern portion of the trough. The system continued to organize as it <b>moved</b> to the west, and based on three ship reports confirming a closed circulation, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on December 31 while located 770miles (1245km) east-northeast of Barbuda in the Lesser Antilles.|$|E

5|$|A low {{pressure}} area <b>moved</b> to the west off the Burmese coast on July 5 and developed into a depression {{the next day in}} the north central Bay of Bengal. The depression intensified as it <b>moved</b> to the northwest, becoming a deep depression on July 7. The system made landfall on the Orissa coast during the morning of July 8 and rapidly degenerated into a broad area of {{low pressure}} overland.

5|$|A {{total of}} 30 {{tropical}} depressions formed in 1984 in the Western Pacific, of which 27 became tropical storms, 16 reached typhoon intensity, and two reached super typhoon strength.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave <b>moved</b> {{into the}} Pacific Ocean from Central America on September 10. Convection along the wave became better organized as it <b>moved</b> westward, and a tropical depression developed on September 18. The depression <b>moved</b> generally west-northwestward before strengthening into Tropical Storm Marty on September 19. The storm entrained dry air into its circulation as it curved toward the northwest, disrupting the storm's convective structure and inhibiting further intensification {{for the next}} two days. Eventually, Marty fought off the dry air and intensified, reaching hurricane strength on September 21.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Moves</b> {{can also}} be {{inherited}} through breeding. <b>Moves</b> that a newly hatched Pokémon begins with are divided into three categories: Learned <b>Moves,</b> Inherited <b>Moves,</b> and Hereditary <b>Moves</b> or [...] "Egg Moves". Learned <b>Moves</b> are <b>moves</b> that the Pokémon would have naturally at its starting level; Inherited <b>Moves</b> are those that the Pokémon {{would be able to}} learn at later levels or through TMs; and , inherited from the father (or either parent beginning in Pokémon X and Y), are those that the Pokémon {{would not be able to}} learn normally. The Pokémon can learn the <b>move</b> on this occasion as it receives the <b>move</b> from a parent of a different species. Upon birth, the young Pokémon's <b>move</b> slots are filled with Learned <b>Moves.</b> However, if there are any Inherited or Hereditary <b>Moves</b> available for the Pokémon to learn, they replace the Learned <b>Moves.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave <b>moved</b> off {{the coast}} of Africa on July 1. It steadily organized as it <b>moved</b> westward, and resembled a tropical depression by July 7. However, surface reports and reconnaissance aircraft indicated the system did not have tropical characteristics, and remained simply a low-pressure system. The wave produced tropical storm-force winds as it <b>moved</b> through the Lesser Antilles on July 8, but did not acquire tropical characteristics until it reached the eastern Caribbean. Because it had tropical storm-force winds, the system was upgraded immediately to Tropical Storm Claudette after it developed a low-level circulation later on July 8.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave <b>moved</b> off {{the coast}} of Africa on October4. It <b>moved</b> westward across the Atlantic Ocean without development, and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on October18. The next day, it combined with a previously existing area of disturbed weather, resulting in a large area of convection extending northward into southern Mexico. The broad and disorganized system <b>moved</b> westward at 1015mph (1624km/h). On October20, the system developed an area of low pressure, and began to show signs of organization. It continued to organize, and developed into Tropical Depression Seventeen-E on October21 while located about 265miles (425km) south-southwest of Manzanillo. Upon forming, the depression possessed a small, tight low-level circulation beneath a well-defined mid-level circulation. Easterly wind shear initially restricted upper-level outflow as the cyclone <b>moved</b> to the west, a motion due to a subtropical ridge to its north.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{prevailing}} classification scheme by Lyle Campbell and Terrence Kaufman, the first division occurred around 2200 BCE, when Huastecan split away from Mayan proper after its speakers <b>moved</b> northwest along the Gulf Coast of Mexico. Proto-Yucatecan and Proto-Ch'olan speakers subsequently split off from the main group and <b>moved</b> north into the Yucatán Peninsula. Speakers of the western branch <b>moved</b> south into the areas now inhabited by Mamean and Quichean people. When speakers of proto-Tzeltalan later separated from the Ch'olan group and <b>moved</b> south into the Chiapas highlands, they {{came into contact with}} speakers of Mixe–Zoque languages. According to an alternative theory by Robertson and Houston, Huastecan stayed in the Guatemalan highlands with speakers of Ch'olan-Tzeltalan, separating from that branch at a much later date than proposed by Kaufman.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It is {{well known}} that any two {{diagrams}} representing the same oriented link are related by a finite sequence of Reidemeister <b>moves</b> Ω 1, Ω 2 and Ω 3. Depending on orientations of fragments involved in the <b>moves,</b> one may distinguish 4 different versions of each of the Ω 1 and Ω 2 <b>moves,</b> and 8 versions of the Ω 3 <b>move.</b> We introduce a minimal generating set of four oriented Reidemeister <b>moves,</b> which includes two <b>moves</b> of type Ω 1, one <b>move</b> of type Ω 2 and one <b>move</b> of type Ω 3.

5|$|At {{the end of}} September 1946, the Intertropical Convergence Zone in the Eastern Pacific <b>moved</b> {{north of}} its typical position. An {{associated}} weather disturbance <b>moved</b> over Central America and interacted with a surface low-pressure area over Guatemala. Meanwhile, a broad high-pressure area <b>moved</b> over the United States behind an intense storm that <b>moved</b> eastward into the Atlantic Ocean. Connected to the cyclone was a shear line stretching from Bermuda to the Caribbean Sea, which spawned an upper-level low over open waters. It <b>moved</b> westward on October 4, and {{by the next day}} it was located over the Southeastern United States. The feature over Guatemala began moving toward the northeast as the upper-level low approached and began deepening. Modern-day analysis estimates that the system became a tropical storm early on October 5, shortly after emerging into the Caribbean.|$|E
