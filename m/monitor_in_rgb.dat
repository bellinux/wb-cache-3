50|$|Viggiano {{found that}} white {{balancing}} in the camera's native RGB color model tended to produce less color inconstancy (i.e., less {{distortion of the}} colors) than <b>in</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>RGB</b> for over 4000 hypothetical sets of camera sensitivities. This difference typically amounted to a factor {{of more than two}} in favor of camera RGB. This means that it is advantageous to get color balance right at the time an image is captured, rather than edit later on a monitor. If one must color balance later, balancing the raw image data will tend to produce less distortion of chromatic colors than balancing <b>in</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>RGB.</b>|$|R

40|$|The use {{of color}} in image {{processing}} is motivated by two principal factors; First color is a powerful descriptor that often simplifies object identification and extraction from a scene. Second, human can discern thousands of color shades and intensities, compared to about only two dozen shades of gray. <b>In</b> <b>RGB</b> model, each color appears in its primary spectral components of red, green and blue. This model is based on Cartesian coordinate system. Images represented <b>in</b> <b>RGB</b> color model consist of three component images. One for each primary, when fed into an RGB monitor, these three images combines on the phosphor screen to produce a composite color image. The number of bits used to represent each pixel <b>in</b> <b>RGB</b> space is called the pixel depth. Consider an <b>RGB</b> image <b>in</b> which each of the red, green and blue images is an 8 -bit image. Under these conditions each RGB color pixel {{is said to have}} a depth of 24 bit.

40|$|Colour {{changes on}} fruit during storage from {{brighter}} to darker nuances {{are caused by}} chemical reactions which oft en have degradative changes as a consequence. In this paper, evaluation of colour changes was done in CIE Lab colour model by using Minolta colorimeter CR- 300 and <b>in</b> <b>RGB</b> colour model by applying digital image analysis method. In the aim of increasing of sample representativity analyzed apples were taken from different positions on trees and from different trees in orchard that was planted in 1983. Apples were harvested at a big commercial orchard in two different harvest times during one season. 30 apple pieces of Idared cultivar were analyzed immediately after harvest and periodically during storage for 20 weeks at 0 oC and 85 - 88 % relative humidity. Apple temperature of all analyzed samples during storage period was T= 0 ± 0. 4 oC. Mean colour change of apple skin determined in CIE Lab was ΔEab= 1. 53, while <b>in</b> <b>RGB</b> color model was ΔERGB= 1. 81. Total apple skin colour changes in Lab colour model was ΔEab= 5. 90, while <b>in</b> <b>RGB</b> colour model was ΔERGB= 8. 48. Both methods showed apple skin colour changes in the same way.

40|$|Histogram-based {{color image}} {{enhancement}} is usually accomplished by transforming from RGB coordinates to another coordinate system, modifying the components represented in that system, and converting the results back to RGB.

Such methods seldom yield images that use {{the full extent of}} RGB color range. A new method called "histogram explosion" has been developed to perform true multivariate enhancement directly <b>in</b> <b>RGB</b> color space. Discussed are the algorithm's operational parameters, behavior, implementation, and possible improvements.
