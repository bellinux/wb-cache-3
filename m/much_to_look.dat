500|$|Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} Madonna {{delivered}} a [...] "joyous, unironic, openhearted" [...] show {{rather than a}} cautious performance. According to Tucker, the singer was in [...] "full command"; although the visuals lacked flow, the song transitions meshed [...] "perfectly". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph called the show a [...] "tribute to Madonna" [...] and a [...] "shameless" [...] promotion of the singer's return to the music scene after directing W.E.: [...] "The message [...] {{is that she is}} back in business. I suspect she’d settle for a global number one over global harmony". Troy Patterson of Slate wrote that Madonna retained her [...] "greatest marketing agent" [...] title with the show and praised its costumes, sets and the singer's repeated self-referencing. Linda Holmes of NPR said, [...] "What's curious, given how much 'ewww, she's too old' stuff went around on Twitter, is that everything she did Sunday night is exactly what it should mean to age gracefully". Miriam Coleman of Rolling Stone called the show a [...] "serious spectacle", and Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News called it a [...] "high-concept music video": [...] "Madonna brilliantly manipulates the combined impact of visuals and sonics. The 13-minute performance was an eye-popping marvel". A Huffington Post reviewer wrote, [...] "Love her or hate her, there's no doubt that only Madonna can bring a certain level of pop flair to a performance". Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic praised the show's choreography and cinematography: [...] "With so, so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at, Madonna remained the center of attention. That is, until the end, when white light and smoke engulfed her and she dropped down through the stage, out of sight". According to Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle, Madonna controlled her nerves and he liked her selection of songs.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{graduation}} Lake {{was ordained}} a deacon in the Church of England (1895) {{and served as}} curate in Lumley, Durham, where he preached to the pitmen and miners in that North Country mining district. [...] "I {{do not believe that}} theology entered very much into his sermons," [...] recalls his son, [...] "but he did conduct The Mikado and he still {{tells the story of the}} brawny pitman who, having rescued him from the attack of a drunken navvy from a neighbouring village and listened to his comments on the situation, said 'Mon, he's no <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at, but has he no a bonny tongue?!'" [...] After a year's service he was ordained priest (1896), however he had further issues with his heart and decided to return to Oxford, to the less rigorous climate of the South in order to improve his health.|$|E

60|$|It was midwinter. The {{owner of}} Willow Creek stood at his parlour window, smoking and gazing. There was not <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at, for snow had {{overwhelmed}} and buried the landscape, fringed every twig of the willows, and obliterated the frozen river.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] he said reflectively, [...] "what we men see in you. You {{have plenty}} of admirers. They say that Grefton got himself shot out at the front because you treated him badly. Yet--you are not <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at, are you?" ...|$|E

50|$|From the XUL code {{it is easy}} to {{see what}} the layout of the table will be. The {{assumption}} is that for web-designers it is <b>much</b> easier <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at a declarative page that uses familiar, HTML like tags. The application developers can concentrate on specifying the behavior for the GUI elements. There is also a good separation between layout, styling and processing.|$|R
