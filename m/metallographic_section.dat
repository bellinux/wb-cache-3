40|$|An {{investigation}} into the mechanisms of failure of current Björk-Shiley cardiac valve prostheses is reported. Two failed valves, one apparently unfailed but defective valve, and one unused valve, were examined by scanning electron microscopy and <b>metallographic</b> <b>section.</b> In the first two valves (removed 12 and 23 months after implantation) fracture {{was associated with the}} welds joining the short strut to the valve ring. The fracture surfaces in all cases were heavily faceted and showed branching cracks. Extensive wear had occurred on one fracture surface in the first case, suggesting that one leg of the short strut had failed before the other, though this had been clinically undetectable. The third valve was removed owing to failure of the suturing (24 months after implantation) but one leg of the short strut was found to be completely fractured. The other leg showed extensive cracking and porosity in the weld region. A <b>metallographic</b> <b>section</b> taken through the weld region of the fourth (unused) valve illustrated several sizable defects directly attributable to the welding process. It is suggested that the valves failed by fatigue and that these problems could be overcome if the complete valve cage were machined as a single piece...|$|E

Presented paper describes cementite lamellae fragmentation during accelerated carbide spheroidisation. Mechanism of cementite lamellae fragmentation during conventional soft annealing depends on carbon and iron diffusion in ferrite-cementite system. On the other hand, accelerated carbide spheroidisation relies on partial pearlite austenitization and backward austenite decomposition. Aim of presented experiments was to examine shape evolution of cementite particles during transition from lamellar to globular form.

40|$|Abstract. Rolling contact fatigue (RCF) {{damage is}} {{becoming}} more frequent with increased traffic and loading conditions in the railway industry. Defects which are characterized by a two-lobe darkened surface and a V-shaped surface-breaking crack are often so-called squats. The origination and propagation of squats in railway rails is the topic of many recent studies; the associated crack networks develop with complicated geometry near the surface of rails that is difficult to characterise using most non-destructive methods. The cracks can be examined with repeated <b>metallographic</b> <b>sectioning,</b> but the process is time-consuming and destructive. In order to reduce time, as well as information and material loss, high-resolution and high-energy X-ray imaging of railway rails was done in the current study. Combining the exposures from a range of angles using image analysis, a 3 D representation of the complex crack network is achieved.

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{presented}} for {{the measurement of}} equilibrium dihedral angles in intergranular inclusions, and illustrated with pure copper containing 1 wt % lead. The method {{is based on the}} selective dissolution of inclusions visible along a polished <b>metallographic</b> <b>section.</b> Scanning electron microscopy stereo image pairs are then taken and processed so as to enable a three-dimensional digital reconstruction of the inclusion/matrix interface along each inclusion. Spherical caps describing the Cu/Pb interface over non-facetted orientations are then fitted to the measured digital inclusion envelope reconstructions. Knowing the center and radius of these spheres, the true dihedral angle of each specific inclusion can then be deduced with good precision. It is found that the true dihedral angle in the Cu/Pb alloy is not a unique function of temperature, reflecting the (known) anisotropy of high-angle grain boundary energy in copper.

40|$|Heavy-section {{castings}} made of {{spheroidal graphite}} cast irons {{are known to}} be prone to graphite degeneracy. Upon the various degenerate forms of graphite reported in the literature, chunky graphite is the most common and detrimental one. A great deal of effort has been made for many years to prevent its formation but no convincing description of the factors controlling its appearance has been given so far. In large-size castings, chunky graphite generally appears away from the surface and its occurrence is made evident on a <b>metallographic</b> <b>section</b> by a darker contrast. Because of this sharp and clear transition between the non-affected and the affected zones, several authors looked for chemical heterogeneities at the scale of the part but all concluded to the absence of macrosegregation.

40|$|Extrudability of {{aluminum}} alloys of the 6 xxx series is {{highly dependent on}} the microstructure of the homogenized billets. It is therefore very important to characterize quantitatively the state of homogenization of the as-cast billets. The quantification of the homogenization state {{was based on the}} measurement of specific microstructural indices, which describe {{the size and shape of}} the intermetallics and indicate the state of homogenization. The indices evaluated were the following: aspect ratio (AR), which is the ratio of the maximum to the minimum diameter of the particles, feret (F), which is the maximum caliper length, and circularity (C), which is a measure of how closely a particle resembles a circle in a 2 D <b>metallographic</b> <b>section.</b> The method included extensive metallographic work and the measurement of a large number of particles, including a statistical analysis, in order to investigate the effect of homogenization time. Among the indices examined, the circularity index exhibited the most consistent variation with homogenization time. The lowest value of the circularity index coincided with the metallographic observation for necklace formation. Shorter homogenization times resulted in intermediate homogenization stages involving rounding of edges or particle pinching. The results indicated that the index-based quantification of the homogenization state could provide a credible method for the selection of homogenization process parameters towards enhanced extrudability...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} concerns weldments in P 91 {{steel and}} their creep behaviour. Its scope covers three main topics: the microstructure and creep {{response of the}} (i) weld metal, (ii) parent metal, and (iii) the effect of extended thermal exposure and creep on the weldments. Microstructural examination of the weld metal revealed an inhomogeneous structure, with each bead consisting of a columnar region, a coarse-grained region and a fine-grained region (the latter two regions resulting from heat-treatment of the weld bead by deposition of subsequent beads). The columnar regions exhibited high hardness whereas the coarse and fine grained regions exhibited lower hardnesses. SEM imaging revealed that the precipitate distribution throughout the weld was somewhat inhomogeneous, due to inadequate mixing in the weld pool during welding, leading to segregation and liquation effects. Examination by TEM revealed a fine martensitic structure with a distribution of chromium carbides, in addition to Mn-rich inclusions. Anisotropy of microstructure was assessed by metallographic examination on planes with normals parallel to and perpendicular to the welding direction. Creep tests on this material were performed, with the stress axis both parallel and perpendicular to the welding direction. Anisotropic creep behaviour was observed and correlated with the microstructural anisotropy. Failure life is significantly longer when uniaxial creep stress {{is parallel to the}} welding direction. The columnar regions of the weld were observed to be creep-strong with a low strain to failure whereas the coarse and fine grained regions were observed to be creep-weak with a higher strain to failure. Microstructural variations within weldments as a function of time and temperature have also been investigated. Specimens were aged at five temperatures between 760 °C and 650 °C for up to 12000 hours. At all exposure temperatures, the parent metal showed little change in terms of fine (subgrain) microstructure and hardness. Significant degradation of the weld metal microstructure was observed. This consisted of recrystallisation, emanating from the weld bead boundaries; in some cases, the recrystallised areas made up approximately 40 % of the <b>metallographic</b> <b>section.</b> The hardness of the recrystallised regions was typically 170 kgf mm- 2, whereas that of the non-recrystallised areas was 240 kgf mm- 2. TEM examination of the weld metal showed significant change, in the form of transformation of fine martensitic lath structure to larger, more equi-axed subgrains. Creep tests of aged crossweld samples showed accelerated minimum strain rates and reduced failure lives. It was also observed in crossweld specimens creep-tested at three stress levels between 70 MPa and 93 MPa that the failure location moved from the fine-grained HAZ to the parent at the highest test stress. The HAZ failures exhibited extensive cavitation restricted to the HAZ, and low failure ductility. The high stress parent metal failure, on the other hand, showed high ductility and extensive voiding and grain deformation within the parent metal microstructure. An assessment of the effect of strain on microstructural evolution has been made. This is deemed significant, and strain is believed to accelerate precipitate coarsening and martensite recovery processes. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Background: premature failure of rail axle bearings causes a significant increase in train operating costs and can impact on train safety. Rail axle bearings have an anticipated service life; however, some bearings do not achieve this. A new approach to degradation diagnostics is now in use on Southeastern / Bombardier trains and provides real-time vibration condition monitoring. Each independent wireless sensor unit bolts to a wheel bearing housing. The units are self-powered by vibration harvesting. This emerging methodology has been made possible by the decreasing power budget of sensor and wireless technologies.

The damaged regions of the bearings are examined using a suite of non-destructive techniques including optical and scanning electron microscopy, computed tomography (CT) and surface profilometry as well as traditional <b>metallographic</b> <b>sectioning</b> methods.
