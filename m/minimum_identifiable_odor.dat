40|$|Many species produce odor cues {{that enable}} them to be {{identified}} individually, as well as providing other socially relevant information. Study of the role of odor cues in the social behavior of great apes is noticeable by its absence. Olfaction has been viewed as having little role in guiding behavior in these species. This study examined whether Western lowland gorillas produce an individually <b>identifiable</b> <b>odor.</b> Odor samples were obtained by placing cloths in the gorilla’s den. A delayed matching to sample task was used with human participants (n = 100) to see if they were able to correctly match a target odor sample to a choice of either: 2 odors (the target sample and another, Experiment 1) and 6 odors (the target sample and 5 others, Experiment 2). Participants were correctly able to identify the target odor when given either 2 or 6 matches. Subjects made fewest errors when matching the odor of the silverback, whereas matching the odors of the young gorillas produced most errors. The results indicate that gorillas do produce individually <b>identifiable</b> body <b>odors</b> and introduce the possibility that odor cues {{may play a role in}} gorilla social behavior...|$|R

40|$|The {{routine test}} of {{olfaction}} need {{not lead to}} an ambiguous outcome, a rather widely held notion. A multiple-choice test of odor identification that avoided the difficulty of retrieving odor names yielded excellent resolution among the categories normosmic, hyposmic, and anosmic. The outcome agreed almost perfectly with a more complicated test of threshold and offered much encouragement {{for the use of}} odor identification in rapid screening of olfaction. In 1962, Sumner [1] stated that "The recognition and identification of test substances still remains the only practical means of testing olfaction in the wards, for the quantitative [threshold] method[s] [...] . [are] too time-consuming for routine screening [...] . [and] far too elaborate for anything but the research laboratory " (p. 896). Sumner expressed these sentiments in a report that revealed how poorly normal patients and medical personnel could identify the odors used to test olfaction. The remedy for poor performance seemed elusive. For example, only 75 out of 200 normal persons could identify all four of Sumner's most <b>identifiable</b> <b>odors</b> (coffee, almond, tar, and lemon oil). He therefore concluded that "Even the use of test substances which can be identified more readily will never make the qualitativ...|$|R
40|$|Surface-enhanced {{resonance}} Raman (SERR) spectroscopy {{was used}} to characterize compounds separated by column liquid chromatography (LC). Three percent of the effluent from a conventional-size LC column were immobilized on a moving thinlayer chromatography (TLC) plate using a spray-jet solvent-elimination interface. Next, colloidal silver {{was applied to the}} analyte spots and in situ SERR spectra were recorded with a multichannel micro-Raman spectrometer. Storage of the LC effluent avoids the need to use a continuous flow of colloidal silver and, in principle allows compounds to be detected independently of LC conditions like eluent composition and flow rate. Using dyes as test compounds, the method was optimized and aspects were studied such as type of TLC plate, LC separation of the dyes, preservation of LC integrity during immobilization, and SERR analysis of the deposited compounds. With a silica TLC plate as deposition substrate, good-quality and characteristic SERR spectra were obtained for the dyes which were separated on a cyanoproyl-modified silica LC column with methanol-water containing the volatile additives ammonium acetate and triethylamine as eluent. The <b>minimum</b> <b>identifiable</b> concentration of the dyes was about 250 ng m...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a hierarchical, highly parallel computer algorithm to perform searches for unknown sources of continuous gravitational waves — spinning neutron {{stars in the}} Galaxy — over wide areas {{of the sky and}} wide frequency bandwidths. We optimize the algorithm for an observing period of 4 months and an available computing power of 20 Gflops, in a search for neutron stars resembling millisecond pulsars. We show that, if we restrict the search to the galactic plane, the method will detect any star whose signal is stronger than 15 times the 1 σ noise level of a detector over that search period. Since on grounds of confidence the <b>minimum</b> <b>identifiable</b> signal should be about 10 times noise, our algorithm does only 50 % worse than this and runs on a computer with achievable processing speed. 1 Surveys for neutron stars In this paper we describe progress on developing an efficient computer algorithm to search large areas of the sky for continuous gravitational wave signals from previously unknown sources, most likely spinning neutron stars. The enormous computational cost of processing several months of data by repeatedly applying matched filtering to the data for possible sources lying in each resolved area of the sky is well known. 1, 2 We have previously presented several components o...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A robust, {{adaptive}} system for reconstructing 3 D human motion from monocular video is presented. Our system takes a model based approach. To save computation time, we fit the skeleton instead of full body {{model to the}} silhouette as one constraint. End sites positions identified from the silhouettes serve as another constraint. The alleviation of computational burden then makes the use of simulated annealing practical {{to get rid of}} local <b>minima.</b> The <b>identifiable</b> end sites also serve as the criterion to judge the reconstruction reliability of single frames. According to different reliabilities, the video is segmented into sections, which are reconstructed using different strategies. Our system is robust, getting rid of error accumulation in tracking, and adaptive, being able to tell the user when and where more information is needed...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we revisit the carrier {{frequency}} offset (CFO) estimation and removal for broadband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. We propose an algorithm that explores the time-domain (TD) properties of transmitted symbols carrying pilots and data. A careful {{examination of the}} components that constitute the TD received symbols leads {{to the definition of}} a simple, yet effective, cost function. In a real scenario, the cost function presents a bowl shape with a single global <b>minimum</b> easily <b>identifiable</b> (no local <b>minima).</b> The proposed method is independent of the channel estimation and decision, presenting a very low computational load. The feasibility of the investigated method is substantiated by system simulation using BRAN-A broadband wireless channel model. Simulation results show that the impact of the residual CFO in the systemÂ¿s performance is minimal...|$|R
40|$|The interdiction {{of illicit}} {{radioactive}} materials relies on detecting the emissions from the material when passed {{in front of}} or through a radiation monitor. These portal monitors must be sensitive enough to detect and identify a specified (ANSI N 42. 38) quantity of material. The ability to identify, rather than just detect changes in activity, is important in order to differentiate between benign materials and threat materials. Clearing benign materials has a high cost in time and money. The identification depends on the signal-to-noise ratio, not the gross efficiency, of the detector. In low- or no-resolution detectors the background (noise) is high resulting in a low signal-to-noise ratio and the actual background can {{be affected by the}} object in the portal causing real increases in the background to go undetected. In a high-resolution monitor, the background is determined on the actual object spectrum, avoiding this problem. Portal monitors typically have 5 to 45 seconds to collect the gamma-ray spectrum and then 2 to 5 seconds to analyze the spectrum and give a result. The determination if a gamma-ray peak is present in the spectrum is usually done by calculating a quality factor and then comparing this quality factor with a threshold. The quality factor depends on the net peak area and the background under the peak in some way. The net peak area and the background depend on the full-energy peak efficiency and the detector resolution. The short collection time means there are few counts in the spectrum and the variation in the calculated values is high. The quality factor threshold for positive identification must be set so that the number of false identifications is less than 1 in 1000 measurements (ANSI N 42. 38). This threshold value also determines the <b>minimum</b> <b>identifiable</b> activity for the given background level. To measure this threshold, a pedestrian portal was constructed and the quality factor was measured for 10000 occupancies for several different background levels. The quality factor was also measured for 10000 occupancies with a smal...|$|R
40|$|Many {{pieces of}} {{existing}} and proposed space hardware {{that would be}} targets of interest for a telerobot can be represented as planar or near-planar surfaces. Examples include the biostack modules on the Long Duration Exposure Facility, the panels on Solar Max, large diameter struts, and refueling receptacles. Robust and temporally efficient methods for locating such objects with sufficient accuracy are therefore worth developing. Two techniques that derive the orientation and location of an object from its monocular image are discussed {{and the results of}} experiments performed to determine translational and rotational accuracy are presented. Both the quadrangle projection and elastic matching techniques extract three-space information using a <b>minimum</b> of four <b>identifiable</b> target points and the principles of the perspective transformation. The selected points must describe a convex polygon whose geometric characteristics are prespecified in a data base. The rotational and translational accuracy of both techniques was tested at various ranges. This experiment is representative of the sensing requirements involved in a typical telerobot target acquisition task. Both techniques determined target location to an accuracy sufficient for consistent and efficient acquisition by the telerobot...|$|R
40|$|To {{address the}} need for high {{resolution}} detection systems {{to be used in}} portal monitors and mobile search systems, an integrated gamma ray spectrometer, incorporating a germanium detector with integral mechanical cooling, digital signal processing electronics, MCA, and communications has been developed. This modular subsystem {{can be used in a}} wide variety of applications, including use in stationary or mobile systems for the detection of radioactive materials. To have the sensitivity needed for these applications the detectors must have good low and medium energy detection efficiency coupled with excellent spectral peak resolution. The resolution removes peak overlaps and helps to overcome the problems of masking with common nuclides. In a situation where either the spectrometer or the material is moving, the Field of View (FOV) determines the time the material contributes to the spectrum. The absolute efficiency and background determine the <b>minimum</b> detectable or <b>identifiable</b> quantity for the material in the FOV. To characterize the expected performance in a general system, the absolute efficiency was measured for several units over the energy range of 80 keV to 1. 8 MeV. The horizontal FOV is limited by collimators and was measured for several distances corresponding to the ANSI N 42. 38 test criteria. The vertical FOV (no collimation), important to determine the detector spacing, was also measured. The background was measured in a typical pedestrian portal situation. The measurements presented show this unit can be applied to a wide variety of monitoring situations...|$|R

The uniformity of the performance of several units over the energy range of 80 keV to 1. 8 MeV was previously reported. A portal monitor was constructed with 8 detectors and the performance measured for several common test nuclides. The total height of the detection zone is 2 meters with 4 detectors uniformly spaced on each side. In this portal, the horizontal FOV is limited by steel collimators. The vertical FOV was not collimated. The background was measured in low background and elevated (NORM) background situations.
