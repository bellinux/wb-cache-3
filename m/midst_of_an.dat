5|$|Ball {{struggled}} {{in his first}} season in charge, 1989–90, and his Stoke side were relegated to the third tier of English football after finishing bottom of the Second Division. The start of the 1990–91 season in the Third Division marked the first time Stoke had played at this level in 63 years. Ball kept his job for the start of this campaign but departed in February 1991 in the <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> indifferent season that saw Stoke finish in their lowest league position of 14th.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the general}} {{reputation}} as a mass producer and a consensus that the region is in the <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> economic crisis, parts of the Languedoc wine industry are experiencing commercial success due to outside investment and an increased focus on quality. Sales have been improved by many vineyards that concentrate on creating a good brand name {{rather than relying on}} the sometimes infamous regional designations. Some vineyards have adopted the youngest batch of AOC classifications developed in the late 1990s, while other vineyards eschew designated blends entirely and are instead shifting toward bottling single varietal wines, a practice increasingly demanded by consumers in the large New World wine market.|$|E
5|$|In both Mozambique and Malawi, Delfina dropped heavy {{rainfall}} that caused flooding. In the former country, over 18,000houses were severely damaged or destroyed, leaving thousands homeless. The storm damaged roads and bridges, which disrupted relief {{efforts in the}} aftermath, and floods destroyed widespread areas of crops in the <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ongoing food shortage. Lingering flooding caused an outbreak of cholera and malaria in Mozambique, and 47people were killed by Delfina. In Malawi, flooding was not widespread, although the storm destroyed about 3,600houses and killed eight people. Only {{two months after the}} storm struck, however, Cyclone Japhet left damage and deaths in many of the same areas that Delfina affected.|$|E

5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Imbudo passed about 35km (20mi) north of Yap. The JMA upgraded Imbudo to a severe tropical storm late on July18, {{around the same}} time that the JTWC upgraded it to a typhoon. An increase in outflow to the south and to the north from a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) caused a 36‑hour period of rapid development beginning on July19. During that time, the JMA upgraded Imbudo to typhoon status, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) began issuing advisories as the storm approached the Philippines, and a 30km (20mi) wide eye formed. At 1200UTC on July20, the JMA estimated peak 10minute sustained winds of 165km/h (105mph). At the same time, the JTWC estimated 1minute sustained winds of 240km/h (150mph), making it a super typhoon. By late on July20, the typhoon had developed concentric eyewalls, and the TUTT was moving away, thus diminishing outflow. Imbudo maintained peak winds for about 12hours, before the innermost eye contracted to a diameter of 11km (7mi) in the <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eyewall replacement cycle. At 0300UTC on July22, Imbudo struck northern Luzon, with 1minute winds estimated at 205km/h (125mph) by the JTWC.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1960s then-President Sukarno {{declared}} {{a new state}} ideology of Nasakom, which stood for Nasionalisme, Agama, dan Komunisme (Nationalism, Religion, and Communism), which would complement the existing policy of Pancasila. This declaration, viewed as proof of increasing Indonesian Communist Party (Partai Komunis Indonesia, or PKI) power, led to conflict between the PKI and the military. In the <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> escalating confrontation with Malaysia (1963–1966), Sukarno demoted General Abdul Haris Nasution, Commander of the Army, and promoted Ahmad Yani, while the PKI spread rumours that a CIA-sponsored board of generals (Dewan Jenderal) were plotting against the government, using the Gilchrist Document as proof. Eventually, a coup on 30 September 1965, {{thought to have been}} sponsored by the PKI, killed six generals, leading to the massacre of suspected communists and the fall of Sukarno's government over the next two years.|$|E

At Riverrun, Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie) unsuccessfully negotiates Sansa's request for help from the Blackfish (Clive Russell), and Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) returns Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) to the castle, with Edmure commanding they throw down their arms and surrender to the Lannisters. In King's Landing, Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) learns of her impending trial, and that she {{will not be able to}} demand a trial by combat by royal decree of King Tommen Baratheon (Dean-Charles Chapman). In Meereen, Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) arrives, in the <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> attack on the city by the wise masters of Yunkai, Astapor and Volantis.

5|$|In the 1870s, sculptors Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Daniel Chester French {{lived and}} worked near the Square. By the 1920s, Washington Square Park was nationally {{recognized}} as {{a focal point for}} artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU. Famed residents of this time include Eugene O'Neill, John Sloan, and Maurice Prendergast. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning, and the realists Edward Hopper and Thomas Hart Benton had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when Allen Ginsberg and Bob Dylan settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> aggressive facilities expansion phase. In 1975, the university opened The Grey Art Gallery at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.|$|E
5|$|Intense Confederate and {{especially}} Union artillery fire continued {{for at least}} an hour, slackening at about 2:30pm. At about 3:30pm, Lewis Armistead noticed Union skirmishers creeping towards his men where the grand battery on the Confederate right flank was, nearly within rifle range of them. Armistead sent three regiments (about half of his brigade) from his command to push back the skirmishers, thus beginning the infantry part of the battle. The skirmishers were repelled quickly, but Armistead's men found themselves in the <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> intense Union barrage. The Confederates decided to nestle themselves in a ravine along the hill's slant. This position protected them from the fire, but pinned them down on the slopes of Malvern Hill, unsupported by either infantry or artillery. They did not have enough men to advance any further and retreating would have put them back into the crossfire.|$|E
5|$|One of the staged feuds {{heading into}} the event was between Tatanka and Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels. Tatanka was in the <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> undefeated streak and had {{wrestled}} Michaels twice {{in the months leading}} up to WrestleMania IX. Tatanka pinned Michaels in a singles match on the February 13, 1993, episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling and later teamed with The Nasty Boys in a six-man match against Michaels and the Beverly Brothers; Tatanka pinned Michaels to win this match as well. Michaels was also feuding with Sensational Sherri, who stood in Tatanka's corner during the match. Sherri had been Michaels' valet. When Marty Jannetty tried to hit Michaels with a mirror, however, Michaels pulled Sherri in front of him to protect himself. Sherri's anger at getting hit over the head with a mirror caused her to turn on him at Royal Rumble 1993.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the Salisbury parliament, Hereford was {{accompanying}} two of the king's daughters to Brabant, and could not be present. On his return, however, as Constable of England, he joined Bigod in July in refusing to perform feudal service. The two earls were joined in their opposition by the earls of Arundel and Warwick. The main reasons for the magnates' defiance was the heavy burden of taxation caused by Edward's continuous warfare in Wales, France and Scotland. In this they were also joined by Robert Winchelsey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was in the <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ongoing dispute with the king over clerical taxation. At one point Bohun and Bigod turned up in person at the Exchequer to protest a tax they claimed did not have the consent of the community of the realm. For Hereford there was also a personal element in the opposition to the king, after the humiliation and the affront to his liberties he had suffered over the dispute in the Marches. At a meeting just outside London, Bohun gave an impassioned speech objecting to the king's abuse of power and demanding the restoration of ancient liberties. The grievances were summarised in a document known as the Remonstrances.|$|E
