5|$|A popular {{approach}} {{to improve performance}} {{is to create a}} <b>memory</b> pool-based allocator. Instead of allocating <b>memory</b> every time an item is inserted or removed from a container, a large block of <b>memory</b> (the <b>memory</b> pool) is allocated beforehand, possibly at the startup of the program. The custom allocator will serve individual allocation requests by simply returning a pointer to <b>memory</b> from the pool. Actual deallocation of <b>memory</b> can be deferred until the lifetime of the <b>memory</b> pool ends. An example of <b>memory</b> pool-based allocators {{can be found in the}} Boost C++ Libraries.|$|E
5|$|Computer {{architectures}} {{in which}} each element of main <b>memory</b> can be accessed with equal latency and bandwidth are known as uniform <b>memory</b> access (UMA) systems. Typically, {{that can be achieved}} only by a shared <b>memory</b> system, in which the <b>memory</b> is not physically distributed. A system that does not have this property is known as a non-uniform <b>memory</b> access (NUMA) architecture. Distributed <b>memory</b> systems have non-uniform <b>memory</b> access.|$|E
5|$|Concurrent {{programming}} languages, libraries, APIs, {{and parallel}} programming models (such as algorithmic skeletons) {{have been created}} for programming parallel computers. These can generally be divided into classes based on the assumptions they make about the underlying <b>memory</b> architecture—shared <b>memory,</b> distributed <b>memory,</b> or shared distributed <b>memory.</b> Shared <b>memory</b> programming languages communicate by manipulating shared <b>memory</b> variables. Distributed <b>memory</b> uses message passing. POSIX Threads and OpenMP {{are two of the}} most widely used shared <b>memory</b> APIs, whereas Message Passing Interface (MPI) is the most widely used message-passing system API. One concept used in programming parallel programs is the future concept, where one part of a program promises to deliver a required datum to another part of a program at some future time.|$|E
25|$|It {{is known}} that autobiographical <b>memories</b> {{initially}} are stored as episodic <b>memories,</b> but it is currently unknown if autobiographical <b>memories</b> {{are the same as}} episodic <b>memories</b> or if the autobiographical <b>memories</b> become converted to semantic <b>memories</b> with time.|$|R
50|$|Field vs. Observer: Autobiographical <b>memories</b> can be {{experienced}} from different perspectives. Field <b>memories</b> are <b>memories</b> recollected {{in the original}} perspective, from a first-person point of view. Observer <b>memories</b> are <b>memories</b> recollected from a perspective outside ourselves, a third-person point of view. Typically, older <b>memories</b> are recollected through an observer perspective, and observer <b>memories</b> are more often reconstructions while field <b>memories</b> are more vivid like copies.|$|R

5|$|In {{people with}} AD, the {{increasing}} impairment {{of learning and}} <b>memory</b> eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, perception (agnosia), or execution of movements (apraxia) are more prominent than <b>memory</b> problems. AD does not affect all <b>memory</b> capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life (episodic <b>memory),</b> facts learned (semantic <b>memory),</b> and implicit <b>memory</b> (the <b>memory</b> of the body {{on how to do}} things, such as using a fork to eat or how to drink from a glass) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories.|$|E
5|$|Main <b>memory</b> in a {{parallel}} computer is either shared <b>memory</b> (shared between all processing elements in a single address space), or distributed <b>memory</b> (in which each processing element has its own local address space). Distributed <b>memory</b> refers {{to the fact that}} the <b>memory</b> is logically distributed, but often implies that it is physically distributed as well. Distributed shared <b>memory</b> and <b>memory</b> virtualization combine the two approaches, where the processing element has its own local <b>memory</b> and access to the <b>memory</b> on non-local processors. Accesses to local <b>memory</b> are typically faster than accesses to non-local <b>memory.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some studies {{indicate}} that flashbulb <b>memories</b> are not more accurate than other types of <b>memories.</b> It {{has been reported that}} <b>memories</b> of high school graduation or early emotional experiences can be just as vivid and clear as flashbulb <b>memories.</b> Undergraduates recorded their three most vivid autobiographical <b>memories.</b> Nearly all of the <b>memories</b> produced were rated to be of high personal importance, but low national importance. These <b>memories</b> were rated as having the same level of consequentiality and surprise as <b>memories</b> for events of high national importance. This indicates that flashbulb <b>memories</b> may just be a subset of vivid <b>memories</b> and {{may be the result of}} a more general phenomenon.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{experiment}} reported here {{was to investigate the}} processes underlying the construction of truthful and deliberately fabricated <b>memories.</b> Properties of <b>memories</b> created to be intentionally false - fabricated <b>memories</b> - were compared to properties of <b>memories</b> believed to be true - true <b>memories.</b> Participants recalled and then wrote or spoke true <b>memories</b> and fabricated <b>memories</b> of everyday events. It was found that true <b>memories</b> were reliably more vivid than fabricated <b>memories</b> and were nearly always recalled from a first person perspective. In contrast, fabricated differed from true <b>memories</b> in that they were judged to be reliably older, were more frequently recalled from a third person perspective, and linguistic analysis revealed that they required more cognitive effort to generate. No notable differences were found across modality of reporting. Finally, it was found that, intentionally fabricated <b>memories</b> were created by recalling and then ‘editing’ true <b>memories.</b> Overall, these findings show that true and fabricated <b>memories</b> systematically differ, despite the fact that both are based on true <b>memories...</b>|$|R
50|$|Several {{studies have}} shown a {{positivity}} effect for autobiographical <b>memories</b> in older adults. One study found a positivity bias for involuntary <b>memories,</b> where younger adults did not rate their involuntary <b>memories</b> as positively as did older adults. Voluntary <b>memories</b> did not show this difference. Another study found a reminiscence bump for adults in their 20s for happy involuntary <b>memories</b> but not for unhappy involuntary <b>memories.</b> Happy involuntary <b>memories</b> were also {{more than twice as}} frequent as unhappy involuntary <b>memories.</b> In older participants, a bump for <b>memories</b> reported as most important and happy was found. The saddest and most traumatic <b>memories</b> showed a declining retention function. The positivity bias could reflect an emphasis on emotional-regulation goals in older adults.|$|R
5|$|Managed <b>memory</b> {{cannot be}} {{explicitly}} freed; instead, it is automatically garbage collected. Garbage collection addresses {{the problem of}} <b>memory</b> leaks by freeing the programmer of responsibility for releasing <b>memory</b> {{that is no longer}} needed.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{there are}} many {{scenarios}} where customized allocators are desirable. Some {{of the most common}} reasons for writing custom allocators include improving performance of allocations by using <b>memory</b> pools, and encapsulating access to different types of <b>memory,</b> like shared <b>memory</b> or garbage-collected <b>memory.</b> In particular, programs with many frequent allocations of small amounts of <b>memory</b> may benefit greatly from specialized allocators, both in terms of running time and <b>memory</b> footprint.|$|E

40|$|To {{provide the}} {{three-way}} comparisons needed to test existing theories, we compared (1) most-stressful <b>memories</b> to other <b>memories</b> and (2) involuntary to voluntary <b>memories</b> (3) in 75 community dwelling adults with and 42 without a current diagnosis of {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD). Each rated their three most-stressful, three most-positive, seven most-important and 15 word-cued autobiographical <b>memories,</b> and completed tests of personality and mood. Involuntary <b>memories</b> were then recorded and rated as they occurred for 2 weeks. Standard mechanisms of cognition and affect applied to extreme events accounted for the properties of stressful <b>memories.</b> Involuntary <b>memories</b> had greater emotional intensity than voluntary <b>memories,</b> but were not more frequently related to traumatic events. The emotional intensity, rehearsal, and centrality to the life story of both voluntary and involuntary <b>memories,</b> rather than incoherence of voluntary traumatic <b>memories</b> and enhanced availability of involuntary traumatic <b>memories,</b> were the properties of autobiographical <b>memories</b> associated with PTSD...|$|R
50|$|Positive autobiographical <b>memories</b> {{contain more}} sensory and contextual details than {{negative}} and neutral <b>memories.</b> People high in self-esteem recall more details for <b>memories</b> where the individual displayed positive personality traits than <b>memories</b> dealing with negative personality traits. People with high self-esteem also devoted {{more resources to}} encoding these positive <b>memories</b> over negative <b>memories.</b> In addition, {{it was found that}} people high in self-esteem reactivate positive <b>memories</b> more often than people with low self-esteem, and reactivate <b>memories</b> about other people's negative personality traits more often to maintain their positive self-image.|$|R
5|$|A {{study by}} Sanchez and Wiley showed that seductive details caused poor {{learning}} outcomes because they take {{up some of}} the limited space in working <b>memory.</b> The experiment compared people's ability to control their attention to scientific text that contained either seductive images, relevant images, or no images. The study showed that people with low working <b>memory</b> capacity were especially vulnerable to the seductive details effect. Sanchez and Wiley also did an experiment where eye-tracking was monitored to evaluate how people were reading the same seductively illustrated scientific text. The results showed that people with low working <b>memory</b> looked at the seductive illustrations more often and for longer than those with high working <b>memory</b> capacity. It could be argued that differences in performance between high- and low- working <b>memory</b> capacity individuals is really due to general reading ability, an attribute that has been correlated with working <b>memory</b> capacity in other studies.|$|E

40|$|Inadequate {{processing}} of trauma information {{is considered to}} lead to particularly vivid recollections and disorganized <b>memories</b> of the trauma. Although trauma <b>memories</b> have mainly been investigated in PTSD, <b>memories</b> in other psychiatric disorders may actually share some characteristics.

To test this hypothesis, PTSD trauma <b>memories</b> (n = 59) were compared with PDA panic <b>memories</b> (n = 58), and trauma <b>memories</b> of healthy trauma victims (n = 135) on self-reported re-experiencing and disorganization.

25|$|Researchers do {{not agree}} about how long episodic <b>memories</b> are stored in the hippocampus. Some {{researchers}} believe that episodic <b>memories</b> always rely on the hippocampus.

25|$|The {{relatively}} small number of processors in early systems, allowed them to easily use a shared <b>memory</b> architecture, which allows processors to access a common pool of <b>memory.</b> In the early days a common approach was the use of uniform <b>memory</b> access (UMA), in which access time to a <b>memory</b> location was similar between processors. The use of non-uniform <b>memory</b> access (NUMA) allowed a processor to access its own local <b>memory</b> faster than other <b>memory</b> locations, while cache-only <b>memory</b> architectures (COMA) allowed for the local <b>memory</b> of each processor to be used as cache, thus requiring coordination as <b>memory</b> values changed.|$|E
25|$|Non-declarative <b>memory</b> is <b>memory</b> {{gained from}} {{previous}} experiences that is unconsciously applied to everyday scenarios. Non-declarative <b>memory</b> {{is essential for}} the performance of learned skills and habits, for example, running or cooking a favourite meal. There are three types of non-declarative memories: implicit <b>memory</b> (unconscious <b>memory,</b> priming), instrumental <b>memory</b> (classical conditioning), and procedural <b>memory</b> (automatic skill <b>memory).</b>|$|E
25|$|Semantic <b>memory</b> {{is one of}} the {{two types}} of {{declarative}} or explicit <b>memory</b> (our <b>memory</b> of facts or events that is explicitly stored and retrieved). Semantic <b>memory</b> refers to general world knowledge that we have accumulated throughout our lives. This general knowledge (facts, ideas, meaning and concepts) is intertwined in experience and dependent on culture. Semantic <b>memory</b> is distinct from episodic <b>memory,</b> which is our <b>memory</b> of experiences and specific events that occur during our lives, from which we can recreate at any given point. For instance, semantic <b>memory</b> might contain information about what a cat is, whereas episodic <b>memory</b> might contain a specific <b>memory</b> of petting a particular cat. We can learn about new concepts by applying our knowledge learned from things in the past. The counterpart to declarative or explicit <b>memory</b> is nondeclarative <b>memory</b> or implicit <b>memory.</b>|$|E

25|$|The loss of episodic <b>memories</b> in PD {{patients}} typically {{demonstrates a}} temporal gradient wherein older <b>memories</b> {{are generally more}} preserved than newer <b>memories.</b> Also, while forgetting event content is less compromised in Parkinson’s than in Alzheimer's, {{the opposite is true}} for event data <b>memories.</b>|$|R
50|$|Semanticizing <b>memories,</b> generalizing episodic <b>memories</b> by {{removing}} the specific temporal and spatial contexts, makes <b>memories</b> more persistent than age sensitive episodic <b>memories.</b> Recent <b>memories</b> (retention interval) are episodic.

With the passing of time, autobiographical <b>memories</b> may consist more of general information than specific details of a particular event or time. In one study where participants recalled events from five life periods, older adults concentrated more on semantic details which were not tied to a distinct temporal or spatial context. Younger participants reported more episodic details such as activities, locations, perceptions, and thoughts. Even when probed for contextual details, older adults still reported more semantic details compared with younger adults.|$|R
