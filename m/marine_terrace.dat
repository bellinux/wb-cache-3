25|$|At {{the time}} of the {{erection}} of the Clock Tower, Ann Thwaytes (1789–1866) was the rich widow of London grocer William Thwaytes. Between 1834 and 1840 she visited Herne Bay regularly with friends, staying with Mr Camplin who owned number 8 (now 30) <b>Marine</b> <b>Terrace</b> on Central Parade, and became an established town benefactor of Herne Bay. While there in 1836 she donated £4,000 for the erection of the Clock Tower, which may have cost £5,000 to build. A blue plaque has been erected in her memory by City of Canterbury Council, at Central Parade near the Clock Tower.|$|E

25|$|The Clock Tower was {{conceived}} {{within five years}} of the completion of Herne Bay's first pier of 1832, when the town was {{in the throes of}} its initial popularity and development. Herne Bay historian Mike Bundock suggests a possible inspiration for the unusual design of this tower. On the back of 31 <b>Marine</b> <b>Terrace,</b> next door to Mrs Thwaytes' holiday residence, was a Royal Exchange Assurance lead firemark badge which bore a picture of the Royal Exchange tower, designed by Edward Jarman in 1721. Mrs Thwaytes was already familiar with the Royal Exchange tower, as she had lived close to it during her marriage. In 1836, possibly inspired by the success of the nearby pier and the grandeur of this image, Mrs Thwaytes requested the young architect Edwin James Dangerfield (1807–1879) of London and Herne Bay to draw a plan of a tower in the style of a Grecian temple with a clock at the top.|$|E
500|$|First {{suspected}} from {{mapping of}} gravitational anomalies in 1965 and an uplifted <b>marine</b> <b>terrace</b> at Restoration Point (foreground in picture above), the Seattle Fault's existence and likely hazard were definitely established {{by a set}} of five reports published in Science in 1992. [...] These reports looked at the timing of abrupt uplift and subsidence around Restoration Point and Alki Point (distant right side of picture), tsunami deposits on Puget Sound, turbidity in lake paleosediments, rock avalanches, and multiple landslides around Lake Washington, and determined that all these happened about 1100 years ago (between A.D. 900930), and most likely due to an earthquake of magnitude 7 or greater on the Seattle Fault.|$|E
2500|$|Goat Rock Beach {{is subject}} to {{continuing}} marine erosion as well as windborne erosion, thus creating a situation where an average of one to three feet per year of land mass is lost, except for the hardest of outcrop formations [...] [...] In winters of heavy storms this value can be yet higher. [...] Over the last geologic epoch the land has been subject to uplift, a process combined with marine erosion, which has created a <b>marine</b> <b>terrace</b> above the entire extent of the beach. [...] This <b>marine</b> <b>terrace</b> elevation varies approximately 30 to 150 feet (10 to 50 meters) above mean sea level, which results in a steep bluff directly above the littoral zone, and a succession of terrace levels.|$|E
50|$|During late Cenozoic Era, {{because of}} {{sustained}} transpression of the Pacific Plate onto the American Plate along the nearby San Andreas Fault Zone, there was continued uplift {{of the entire}} coastline of California, so that erosive action of marine waves cut these terraces in the Monterey Bay area. Those Pleistocene <b>marine</b> <b>terraces</b> are composed of clay, silt, sand and gravel with a basal unconformity of gravel on top of rock. The creation of uplifted <b>marine</b> <b>terraces</b> that started to appear during the Pleistocene Epoch continues throughout the (present) Holocene Epoch of the Quaternary Period due to transpression of the Pacific Plate onto the American Plate. During the October 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the <b>marine</b> <b>terraces</b> of the Monterey Bay were further uplifted. Both Monterey and Santa Cruz have classical uplifted wave-cut shorelines with multiple sets of uplifted and exposed <b>marine</b> <b>terraces.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The active San Andreas Fault runs roughly {{parallel}} {{and near}} to the coastline of Goat Rock Beach. [...] Soils within the site are classified as coastal beach sands (where rocky shoreline is not evident) and escarpment group soils on the marine terrace; typically soils above the <b>marine</b> <b>terrace</b> are in the Rohnerville loam group. [...] Most of the beach sands consist of a medium coarse brown to gray sandy materials, reflecting {{the high rate of}} erosion of escarpment soils into the ocean; however, there are patches of dark gray smooth pebble beach such as the approximately one hundred meter stretch lying immediately north of Goat Rock.The beach is changed every year.|$|E
2500|$|The oldest {{natural history}} of this area related to mammals manifests {{in a series of}} rock {{outcrops}} about one third of a mile south of Goat Rock Beach, positioned above the shoreline on a low lying <b>marine</b> <b>terrace.</b> [...] There are uplifted sea stack formations with prominent rubbing marks about two to four meters in elevation above the ground surface, a height too high to have been caused by modern bovids. [...] Mammoths are believed to have roamed here as recently as 40,000 years ago, and they are thought to have created these severe rubbing marks. [...] Mammoth fossil remains have been found at Bodega Head {{at the south end of}} Sonoma Coast State Beach.|$|E
2500|$|Volcanic {{activity}} approximately 66 {{million years}} ago in the Cretaceous Period created offshore islands beginning in the southern portion of the current range. [...] These Roseburg volcanics were followed by the Siletz River Volcanics in the northern portions of the range, and lastly a series of basalt flows from the Columbia River basalts also added to these formations with some smaller flows in-between. Much of the formations are the result of pillow basalt formations created when a hot basalt flow rapidly cooled upon meeting the salt water of the ocean. These deposits offshore were then pushed into the continental plate as a forearc basin rotating slowly over millions of years. This tectonic collision forced the basalt formations (and newer sedimentary rock formations that include <b>marine</b> <b>terrace</b> deposits) upward and created the coastal range.|$|E
5000|$|The morphostratigraphic {{approach}} focuses {{especially in}} regions of marine regression on the altitude {{as the most}} important criterion to distinguish coast lines of different ages. Moreover, individual <b>marine</b> <b>terraces</b> can be correlated based on their size and continuity. Also paleo-soils as well as glacial, fluvial, eolian and periglacial landforms and sediments may be used to find correlations between terraces. [...] On New Zealand’s North Island, for instance, tephra and loess were used to date and correlate <b>marine</b> <b>terraces.</b> [...] At the terminus advance of former glaciers <b>marine</b> <b>terraces</b> can be correlated by their size, as their width decreases with age due to the slowly thawing glaciers along the coast line.|$|R

2500|$|The coastal prairie soils on the <b>marine</b> <b>terrace</b> {{above the}} beach are {{moderately}} well drained and granular with moderate soil permeability; these features manifest high erosion potential and moderately high bio-productivity. Acidity of these loamy soils is medium to high, and thus some vegetative stunting and hospitality to rare plants is offered; however the tree stunting {{is not as}} pronounced as farther north along the Mendocino coast, which presents extensive and exaggerated pygmy forests. The upland environment on the coastal prairie offers a range of grass species and wildflowers including varieties of lupine, thistle and wild oats. [...] The typical annual plant productivity is approximately 1500 kilograms per acre of air dried yield per annum in an abundant moisture year, and about half that amount in a very dry year. [...] A variety of birds and mammals thrive on the coastal prairie including numerous California Mule Deer, Odocoileus hemionus californicus.|$|E
