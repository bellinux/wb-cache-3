5000|$|The {{main reason}} for this was the {{existence}} of different levels of the intensity and productivity of labour in different countries, creating for example a very different cost structure in different countries {{for all kinds of}} products. Products that took 1 hour of labour to <b>make</b> in country <b>A</b> might take 10 hours to make in country B, a difference in production costs which could strongly influence the exchange values realised in the trade between A and B. More labour could, in effect, exchange for less labour internationally (an [...] "unequal exchange" [...] in value terms) for a prolonged time. In addition, the normal rate of surplus value could be different in different countries.

40|$|Abstract—Active {{learning}} methods aim {{to choose}} the most informative instances to effectively learn a good classifier. Uncertainty sampling, arguably the most frequently utilized active learning strategy, selects instances which are uncertain according to the model. In this paper, we propose a framework that distinguishes between two types of uncertainties: a model is uncertain about an instance due to strong and conflicting evidence (most-surely uncertain) vs. a model is uncertain about an instance {{because it does not}} have conclusive evidence (least-surely uncertain). We show that making a distinction between these uncertainties <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> <b>difference</b> to the performance of active learning. We provide a mathematical formulation to distinguish between these uncertainties for naive Bayes, logistic regression and support vector machines and empirically evaluate our methods on several real-world datasets.

This paper builds an ecologicaleconomic system model containing natural capital by employing an endogenous economic growth model with natural capital and environmental protection investment, then analyzes the model's dynamic behavior and imitates the behavior. At the same time, this paper discusses how the economic output is imp acted by the proportion of investment allocation in economic system. The results show that the complexity of ecological-economic system <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> <b>difference</b> in the system behavior in the short and long term. Only in the conditions of the certain proportion of environmental protection investment allocation, can the whole economy –ecological system grow steadily in long-term stability and develop sustainably...|$|R

3000|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} pilot spacing and filter lengths, and we show that the proposed PA IDDD receiver requires very moderate number of pilot symbols, compared to, for example, turbo codes [6].

We propose that pilot symbols be separated from the trellis structure, and simulation confirms the efficiency of the new method.|$|R
30|$|Despite their appearance, crises are not self-evident. There {{are always}} {{multiple}} {{ways in which}} crises can be understood and acted upon. This means that humanitarian crises attain their specific realities through the language and practices in which actors negotiate the meaning of crisis (Is it exceptional? What are its causes? Is there someone to blame?), communicate about this and develop and implement responses. Our field of interest is full of stories: moral principles, political one-liners, policies and dramatic media representations. Understanding the working of discourses of crisis and crisis response is important in analysing how people and institutions deal with humanitarian crises. A classic example concerns socio-natural disasters, whereby it <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> <b>difference</b> for the response if crisis is understood {{as an act of}} God; as the outcome of natural phenomena or climate change; or as the combined effect of hazard, vulnerability and political incapacity (Blaikie et al. 1994; Hilhorst 2004).|$|R
