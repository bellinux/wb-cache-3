50|$|The Lodgepole Chipmunk spans {{from the}} high Sierra Nevada, San Jacinto, San Bernardino, and San Gabriel Mountain ranges of California into the Lake Tahoe region of the west central corner of Nevada. This species lives in subalpine {{coniferous}} forests made primarily of several species of pines (Lodgepole, Jeffrey, Ponderosa, and Sugar) and firs (Douglas, white and red). They can be observed foraging around {{and on top of}} rocks and fallen logs, which make up the forest floor. In 1978, a removal experiment based on observations was conducted by Mark A. Chappell which took four different species of chipmunk into account. This experiment was to detail the process of removal by the different species. In the experiment, it was noted that the four different species were allopatric, meaning they formed non-overlapping borders in their Sierra Nevada habitat. Each species (T. alpinus, T. speciosus, T. amoenus, and T. minimus) was noted to live at different zones making up the Sierra Nevada. The Lodgepole Chipmunk (T. speciosus) was observed living from 2400-3000 meters in the lodgepole pine zone, between the alpine zone (3000+ meters) and the Piñon pine/mountain mahogany zone (1900-2400 meters). This ecological competition for different zones of a single area is determined by physiological and environmental limits, where each species is limited specifically to a zone that best fit each species' habitat preferences. The effects of burning and <b>mechanical</b> <b>thinning</b> were investigated from 1999-2000 and 2002-2003 in the southern Sierra Nevada Mountains. This experiment was conducted through captures of Lodgepole Chipmunks and the results indicated that over a short-term period, forest management techniques such as burning and <b>mechanical</b> <b>thinning</b> do not {{have a significant impact on}} the species in respect to capture rate or population number. However, the experiment did indicate that body mass of these chipmunks decreased because forest structure changed, limiting food availability provided by the cones of trees.|$|E

To address this threat, wildfire mitigation, such as <b>mechanical</b> <b>thinning,</b> often takes place in areas close to exurban development.

40|$|Forest {{managers}} have a standard {{set of tools}} they use to reduce fire hazard: <b>mechanical</b> <b>thinning,</b> brush clearing, mechanical treatment of slash (small woody debris), prescribed fire, and various combinations and timings {{of the use of}} these tools. Although these tools are widely used, the science is sketchy on the benefits and tradeoffs of the different treatments. In response, the national Fire and Fire Surrogates Study (FFS) set up a national network of research sites to study the effects of fire “surrogates,” such as <b>mechanical</b> <b>thinning,</b> mechanical slash treatments, and prescribed fire on forests. Early findings for the Sierra Nevada FFS site are reported here. The study used four treatments: prescribedfire- only, mechanical-only, mechanical-plus-fire, and no-treatment controls.

40|$|Background and Aims: Cost-effective yield {{control is}} {{required}} by the wine industry {{in order to reduce}} the existing worldwide wine surplus and to improve grape quality. The object of this study was to evaluate the chemical and sensory effects on the resulting wines of mechanical cluster thinning performed at different intensities on Grenache, and at different timings (pea size and veraison) on Tempranillo. Methods and Results: The experiments were conducted with a machine harvester in 2007 on two commercial vertical shoot-positioned vineyards in Spain’s Rioja region. In both varieties, <b>mechanical</b> <b>thinning</b> was effective in yield reduction and resulted in more ripened fruit, and wines with higher alcohol and pH values, more intense colour and increased phenolic content. Regardless of the thinning intensity, sensory changes were less noticeable in Grenache than in Tempranillo wines. Of the latter, those from vines thinned during veraison were less aromatic and sour, but had increased astringency. Conclusions: Yield management through <b>mechanical</b> <b>thinning</b> induced changes to the chemical composition of fruit and wines as well as to the wines’ aroma, taste and mouthfeel. The extent of the sensory implications seems to depend on several factors such as the variety and timing of thinning application.
