40|$|Part 1 : Testing MethodologiesInternational audienceWhen {{developing}} SO mechanisms, mapping {{requirements to}} actual designs and implementations demands {{a lot of}} expertise. Among other things, {{it is important to}} define the right degree of freedom for the system that allows for self-organization. <b>Back-to-back</b> <b>testing</b> supports this hard engineering task by an adequate testing method helping to reveal failures in this design and implementation procedure. Within this paper we propose a model-based approach for <b>back-to-back</b> <b>testing.</b> The approach is built on top of the S# framework and integrated into the Visual Studio development environment, enabling the creation of executable test models with comprehensive tooling support for model debugging. By applying the concepts to a self-organizing production cell, we show how it is used to fully automatically reveal faults of a SO mechanism...|$|R

40|$|In {{this project}} we have {{proposed}} {{to investigate a}} number of experimental and theoretical issues associated with the practical use of multi-version software in providing dependable software through fault-avoidance and fault-elimination, as well as run-time tolerance of software faults. In the period reported here we have working on the following: We have continued collection of data on the relationships between software faults and reliability, and the coverage provided by the testing process as measured by different metrics (including data flow metrics). We continued work on software reliability estimation methods based on non-random sampling, {{and the relationship between}} software reliability and code coverage provided through testing. We have continued studying <b>back-to-back</b> <b>testing</b> as an efficient mechanism for removal of uncorrelated faults, and common-cause faults of variable span. We have also been studying <b>back-to-back</b> <b>testing</b> as a tool for improvement of the software change process, including regression testing. We continued investigating existing, and worked on formulation of new fault-tolerance models. In particular, we have partly finished evaluation of Consensus Voting in the presence of correlated failures, and {{are in the process of}} finishing evaluation of Consensus Recovery Block (CRB) under failure correlation. We find both approaches far superior to commonly employed fixed agreement number voting (usually majority voting). We have also finished a cost analysis of the CRB approach...|$|R
40|$|Twenty {{functionally}} equivalent {{programs were}} built and {{tested in a}} multiversion software experiment. Following unit testing, all programs were subjected to an extensive system test. In the process sixty-one distinct faults were identified among the versions. Less than 12 percent of the faults exhibited varying degrees of positive correlation. The common-cause (or similar) faults spanned as many as 14 components. However, a majority of these faults were trivial, and easily detected by proper unit and/or system testing. Only two of the seven similar faults were difficult faults, and both were caused by specification ambiguities. One of these faults exhibited variable identical-and-wrong response span, i. e. response span which varied with the testing conditions and input data. Techniques {{that could have been}} used to avoid the faults are discussed. For example, it was determined that <b>back-to-back</b> <b>testing</b> of 2 -tuples could have been used to eliminate about 90 percent of the faults. In addition, four of the seven similar faults could have been detected by using <b>back-to-back</b> <b>testing</b> of 5 -tuples. It is believed that most, if not all, similar faults could have been avoided had the specifications been written using more formal notation, the unit testing phase was subject to more stringent standards and controls, and better tools for measuring the quality and adequacy of the test data (e. g. coverage) were used...|$|R

40|$|For dynamic {{simulations}} to be credible, {{verification of}} the computer code must {{be an integral part}} of the modelling process. This two-part paper describes a novel approach to verification through program testing and debugging. In Part 1, a methodology is presented for detecting and isolating coding errors using <b>back-to-back</b> <b>testing.</b> Residuals are generated by comparing the output of two independent implementations, in response to identical inputs. The key feature of the methodology is that a specially modified observer is created using one of the implementations, so as to impose an error-dependent structure on these residuals. Each error can be associated with a fixed and known subspace, permitting errors to be isolated to specific equations in the code. It is shown that the geometric properties extend to multiple errors in either one of the two implementations. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd...|$|R

At design speed the tip relative Mach number was 1. 38. The blades were then removed from the facility and ultrapolished to a surface finish of 0. 125 m (5 microinch) or less and retested. At 100 % speed near the design point, the ultrapolished blades showed approximately 0. 3 - 0. 5 % increase in adiabatic efficiency. The difference was greater near maximum flow. Due to increased relative measurement error at 60 and 80 % speed, the performance difference between the normal and ultrapolished blades was indeterminate at these speeds...|$|R

It is shown that the corresponding fatigue life and defect shape agree well with the evidence from a <b>back-to-back</b> <b>test</b> rig. An extensive parameter analysis is conducted focusing on three characteristic points on the tooth profile, respectively near the root, the pitch point and the tooth tip.

The non-destructive testing technique is an important tool for predicting the life of boiler tubes.

40|$|Both {{the tooth}} root and tooth flank load {{carrying}} capacity are characteristic parameters that decisively influence gear size, as well as gearbox design. The principal requirements towards all modern gearboxes are {{to comply with the}} steadily-increasing power density and to simultaneously offer a high reliability of their components.

The present paper initially gives an overview of the main failure modes of case carburized gears resulting from material fatigue. Furthermore, the underlying load and stress mechanisms, under particular contemplation of the gear size, will be discussed, as these considerations principally define the required material properties.

This requires design and development of a platform-specific numerical solution that can benefit from the parallel capabilities of the chosen platform. Graphics processing unit was chosen as a parallel platform for design and development of a numerical solution for a specific physical model in non-linear optics. This problem appears in describing ultra-short pulse propagation in bulk transparent media that has recently been subject to several theoretical and numerical studies. The mathematical model describing this phenomenon is a challenging and complex problem and its numerical modeling limited on current modern workstations. Numerical modeling of this problem requires a parallelisation of an essentially serial algorithms and elimination of numerical bottlenecks.
