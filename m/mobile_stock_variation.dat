The objective of this work was to analyze quantitative and qualitative OM <b>stock</b> <b>variations</b> and to characterize organic compartments in a clayey Dark-Red Latosol under situations of natural savanna vegetation (CER), long-term (PAL) and degraded grasslands (PAD), and fallow conditions (PAC). These were compared with crops under conventional plowing (CCL) and zero tillage (PD). Small organic <b>stock</b> <b>variation</b> was found in surface layer of studied soils, explained by human disturbance of vegetation in CER, no residue exportation in PD and CCL, and by fallow practice in PAC. Particle-size fractionating, considering the compartments plant residues (20 - 2, 000 micrometers), silt-organic (2 - 20 micrometers) and clay-organic (0 - 2 micrometers), showed differences in OM quality, when comparing similar environmental situations. Even with very weak differences, plant residues compartment was an important indicator of organic stock evolution, allowing the characterization of grassland degradation and zero-till effect, when compared with conventional system.
