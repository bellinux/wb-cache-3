5|$|Joyce concocted {{a number}} of money-making schemes during this period, {{including}} an attempt to become a cinema magnate in Dublin. He frequently discussed but ultimately abandoned a plan to import Irish tweed to Trieste. Correspondence relating to that venture with the Irish Woollen Mills were {{for a long time}} displayed in the windows of their premises in Dublin. Joyce's skill at borrowing <b>money</b> <b>saved</b> him from indigence. What income he had came partially from his position at the Berlitz school and partially from teaching private students.|$|E
5|$|Blanche Rosalie Slaughter {{was born}} in 1876 in Lynchburg, Virginia to Mary Harker and John Flavel Slaughter. She had five {{brothers}} and one sister (three other siblings died in childhood), and was educated in Lynchburg before travelling to a finishing school in Baltimore. As a child, she occasionally assisted her two older brothers, who were doctors, on their house visits or by sterilising their instruments, and also attended to pets in her neighbourhood. Following {{the death of her}} father, who had strongly opposed her desire to become a doctor, she joined the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1893 using <b>money</b> <b>saved</b> from her childhood allowance.|$|E
5|$|A {{coincidental}} upswing in {{the fortunes}} of several studios was publicly explained by Code proponents such as the Motion Picture Herald as proof positive that the code was working. Another fortunate coincidence for Code supporters was the torrent of famous criminals such as John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, and Bonnie and Clyde that were killed by police shortly after the PCA took power. Corpses of the outlaws were shown in newsreels around the country, alongside clips of Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly in Alcatraz. Among the unarguably positive aspects of the Code being enforced was the money it saved studios in having to edit, cut, and alter films to get approval from the various state boards and censors. The <b>money</b> <b>saved</b> was in the millions annually. A spate of more wholesome family films featuring performers such as Shirley Temple took off.|$|E

5|$|Satoru Iwata {{was born}} on December6, 1959, and raised in Sapporo, Japan, where his father served as a prefectural official. Throughout middle and high school, Iwata {{displayed}} leadership skills through service as class president, student council president, and club president at various times. His first experience with computers was in middle school with a demo computer that used telephone lines. Iwata would frequent the Sapporo subway and play a simple numeric game, called Game 31, until he mastered it. With <b>money</b> <b>saved</b> up from a dish-washing job and some additional allowance from his father, Iwata purchased an HP-65, the first programmable calculator, in 1974. After entering Hokkaido Sapporo South High School in April1975, he began developing his own games during his junior year. The several simple number games Iwata produced, such as Volleyball and Missile Attack, made use of an electronic calculator he shared with his schoolmates.|$|E
5|$|Until 1760 {{the monarch}} met all {{official}} expenses from hereditary revenues, {{which included the}} profits of the Crown Estate (the royal property portfolio). King George III agreed to surrender the hereditary revenues of the Crown {{in return for the}} Civil List, and this arrangement persisted until 2012. An annual Property Services Grant-in-aid paid for the upkeep of the royal residences, and an annual Royal Travel Grant-in-Aid paid for travel. The Civil List covered most expenses, including those for staffing, state visits, public engagements, and official entertainment. Its size was fixed by Parliament every 10 years; any <b>money</b> <b>saved</b> was carried forward to the next 10-year period. From 2012 until 2020, the Civil List and Grants-in-Aid are to be replaced with a single Sovereign Grant, which will be set at 15% of the revenues generated by the Crown Estate.|$|E

25|$|In {{his first}} week in office, O'Brien changed his {{position}} concerning the O-Train project due to an Ottawa Sun report that, were the project cancelled, there could be lawsuits from Siemens totaling up to $1 billion. O'Brien said that he preferred to cancel only the downtown section, not the entire. On December 6, Ottawa Council voted 12-11 in favour of expanding the O-Train, except the section that would travel through downtown, while adding an environmental assessment that would study the possibility of building underground tunnels beneath Albert and Slater streets. O'Brien added that the <b>money</b> <b>saved</b> on the north-south line would be invested on developing the Transitway in suburban areas. On December 13, he withdrew {{his support for the}} revised plan because the $400 million funding by both the provincial and federal governments would not be returned before the contract deadline of December 15. O'Brien added that the City's signing the contract would be a risk. A new vote was held on December 14 in which the Council voted to cancel the project by a margin of 13-11, with O'Brien and Rainer Bloess, who had been absent in the previous vote, casting the additional votes against the project.|$|E
25|$|In May 2008, Waterfront Toronto (the former TWRC) {{proposed}} {{the demolition of}} the segment from Jarvis Street to the Don River and construction of a widened Lake Shore Boulevard {{in the style of}} University Avenue at a projected cost of $200 to $300 million. The proposal shelved the previous plan to demolish the central section and the construction of the Front Street Extension. Waterfront Toronto proposed to get started on the environmental assessment of the demolition, which is expected to take up to five years and cost $10 million. Councillor Denzil Minnan-Wong criticized the proposal, pointing out that the city already had a $300 million backlog of road repairs. Mayor David Miller endorsed the proposal, noting that the funds for the demolition and the eight-lane boulevard would come from monies saved by not building the Front Street Extension, and <b>money</b> <b>saved</b> on the maintenance of the elevated highway. In July 2008, City Council voted to proceed with the environmental assessment. In March 2009, Waterfront Toronto started the environmental assessment consultation process, with open houses and an online consultation web site. The Terms of Reference were approved by City Council in May 2009 and the Government of Ontario in September 2009 and an Environmental Assessment was expected to start in April 2010.|$|E

500|$|In 1922, the {{publication}} Radio World {{stated that the}} cable's {{first two years of}} operation had been successful. [...] Also in 1922, Radio Broadcast boasted about the <b>money</b> <b>saved</b> by the cable as well as the ease of using it. [...] The cable itself was paid for using public funds, but it was the responsibility of ship owners to outfit their vessels with receiving equipment. Installation of the cable cost roughly $50,000 and the listening apparatus installed on each ship using the channel cost $1,200, compared with hourly costs of delays that ranged from $500 to $4,000. [...] Radio Broadcast expressed the belief that navigation cables would become common for both ships and aircraft: [...] "...there is a future for the audio cable... Its fullest usefulness at American ports and elsewhere waits, however, on that large appreciation of radio devices for sea as well as air navigation which pilots, both on the sea and in the air, expect, but do not as yet demand." ...|$|E

[...] He abandoned a plan to restart Weird Tales in 1962, using reprints from the original magazine, after being advised by Sam Moskowitz {{that there was little}} market for weird and horror fiction at the time. [...] Instead Margulies mined the Weird Tales backfile for four anthologies which appeared in the early 1960s: The Unexpected, The Ghoul-Keepers, Weird Tales, and Worlds of Weird. [...] The latter two were ghost-edited by Moskowitz, who proposed to Margulies that when the time was right to start the magazine up again, it should include reprints from obscure sources that Moskowitz had found, rather than just stories reprinted from the first incarnation of Weird Tales. [...] These stories would be as good as new for most readers, and the <b>money</b> <b>saved</b> could be used for an occasional new story.|$|E
500|$|Having some <b>money</b> <b>saved</b> and, still {{wanting to}} be an {{inventor}} {{as opposed to a}} [...] "medicine man", Colt made arrangements to begin building guns using proper gunsmiths from Baltimore, Maryland. He abandoned the idea of a multiple barreled revolver and opted for a single fixed barrel design with a rotating cylinder. The action of the hammer would align the cylinder bores with the single barrel. He sought the counsel of a friend of his father, Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, who loaned him $300 and advised him to perfect his prototype before applying for a patent. Colt hired a gunsmith by the name of John Pearson to build his revolver. Over the next few years Colt and Pearson fought over money, but the design improved and in 1835 Colt was ready to apply for his U.S. patent. Ellsworth was now the superintendent of the U.S. Patent Office and advised Colt to file for foreign patents first as a prior U.S. patent would keep Colt from filing a patent in Great Britain. In August 1835, Colt left for England and France to secure his foreign patent.|$|E
500|$|Individuals {{under the}} current system who {{accumulated}} savings from ordinary income (by choosing not to spend their money when the income was earned) paid taxes on that income before it was placed in savings (such as a Roth IRA or CD). When individuals spend above the poverty level with <b>money</b> <b>saved</b> {{under the current}} system, that spending would be subject to the FairTax. People living through the transition may find both their earnings and their spending taxed. Critics have stated that the FairTax would result in unfair double taxation for savers and suggest it does not address the transition effect on some taxpayers who have accumulated significant savings from after-tax dollars, especially retirees who have finished their careers and switched to spending down their life savings. Supporters of the plan argue that the current system is no different, since compliance costs and [...] "hidden taxes" [...] embedded in the prices of goods and services cause savings to be [...] "taxed" [...] a second time already when spent. The rebate would supplement accrued savings, covering taxes up to the poverty level. The income taxes on capital gains, estates, social security and pension benefits would be eliminated under FairTax. In addition, the FairTax legislation adjusts Social Security benefits for changes in the price level, so a percentage increase in prices would result in an equal percentage increase to Social Security income. Supporters suggest these changes would offset paying the FairTax under transition conditions.|$|E
