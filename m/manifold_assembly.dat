Laboratory hydraulic experiments have validated the capability of a back pressure control model for the parallel choke assembly to accurately control pressure. This study is of great theoretical and practical significance to further improve the performance of chokes used in managed pressure well drilling.|$|E

40|$|Satellite {{propulsion}} systems are typically complex and costly, and require extensive {{ground support equipment}} and personnel to implement. While these systems may be feasible for large commercial or government programs to execute, they are impractical for micro- and nano-satellite systems. In particular, these small spacecraft cannot utilize classical hazardous or high-pressure components, as small satellites are often hosted as secondary payloads with stringent restrictions imposed. In contrast to this paradigm, an effort to develop, manufacture, and validate a low-cost propulsion system suitable for small, secondary payloads was pursued. Intended for orbit insertion, stationkeeping, and de-orbit operations, this system was developed to operate within the typical constraints of a small satellite. In addition to the aforementioned cost and safety concerns, small satellites possess limited mass, volume, and electrical power. Given these considerations, a straightforward warm gas system was chosen, with liquid butane as propellant. This configuration is not only inherently simple, but can also be manufactured using primarily off-theshelf components, which can be quickly procured in small quantities. With a fully integrated sensor <b>manifold</b> and heating <b>assembly,</b> this design provides performance well suited to a small satellite mission of several years in low- Earth orbit...|$|R
50|$|In most {{production}} engines, the <b>manifold</b> is an <b>assembly</b> {{designed to}} collect the exhaust gas from two or more cylinders into one pipe. Manifolds are often made of cast iron in stock production cars, and may have material-saving design features such as to use the least metal, to occupy the least space necessary, or have the lowest production cost. These design restrictions often result in a design that is cost effective {{but that does not}} do the most efficient job of venting the gases from the engine. Inefficiencies generally occur {{due to the nature of}} the combustion engine and its cylinders. Since cylinders fire at different times, exhaust leaves them at different times, and pressure waves from gas emerging from one cylinder might not be completely vacated through the exhaust system when another comes. This creates a back pressure and restriction in the engine's exhaust system that can restrict the engine's true performance possibilities. In Australia, the pipe of the exhaust system which attaches to the exhaust manifold is called the 'engine pipe' and the pipe emitting gases to ambient air called the 'tail pipe'.|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of an inexpensive floor heating system is studied {{by means of}} a numerical simulation tool. The study deals with an energy efficient detached single-family house. A building with such low space heating demand (25 - 30 kWh/m 2 /year) yields a low floor surface temperature and this in turn means that the so-called self-regulating effect is significant. Initially, the design of the pipe circuits is studied. Especially the allocation of heat between different rooms are studied; the purpose is to find a design where the set-up of required fluid supply temperatures are as uniform as possible among the pipe circuits. Detailed simulations of the heating season is conducted for two simulation cases, one with a constant supply temperature, derived from the initial simulations; and a second case with a variable supply temperature. The results yield an apparent effect of self-regulation; the heat flux from the embedded floor heating pipes increases when the indoor air temperature declines and can be totally blocked when high indoor temperatures arise. Furthermore, excess heat is transferred from over-tempered zones towards the <b>manifold</b> <b>assembly</b> in the hydronic system. The occurrence of heat extraction trough floor heating pipes in certain zones has a levelling effect of the indoor temperature distribution...|$|E
40|$|Natural gas was {{substituted}} for propane {{gas in the}} oxygen-fuel mixture supplying the Technicon AutoAnalyzer flame photometer. This was accomplished {{by the use of}} a ‘/ 3 -hp rotary pump and attached manifold, which compressed the gas from the city line and supplied it at a constant pressure to the burner module of the system. A method for the automatic analysis of serum Li was devised by using K as an internal standard and comparing the output of the Li-sensitive photo-cell with that of an at-tenuated K-sensitive cell. In addition, a simple procedure was incorporated into the routine determination of serum Na and K: samples of insufficient volume were diluted in a solution of known electrolyte concentration, which permitted their quantitation without changing the tubing manifold or other operating components of the system. the introduction of the Technicon AutoAnalyzer * Flame Pho-tometer System in our laboratory about 1 year ago, three problems arose concerning its operation for routine automatic and simultaneous serum electrolyte analyses. These were: (1) Fire Department restric-tions on the use of heavier-than-air fuel gases supplying the burner assembly of the flame photometer, (2) the need for a sensitive, reliable, and rapid method for the determination of serum Li relative {{to the use of the}} Li ion in the treatment of certain psychogenic disorders (2, 3), and (3) the need for a simple procedure to analyze specimens of vol-umes below the minimum required for sampling by the standard tubing <b>manifold</b> <b>assembly</b> of the system.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{cycling test}} {{was required to}} verify {{the integrity of the}} welded joints and the thin wall tube bends in the primary loop <b>manifold</b> <b>assembly</b> of a four pack thermo electric module and to help establish structural and mechanical requirements of any possible redesign. The test section was subjected to more severe loading conditions than will be experienced during actual operating conditions. The test was a mechanical simulation of the differential thermal expansion which occurs due to the approximately 600 {degrees} F temperature differential in the subassembly. The actual load exerted on the test section represented this deflection. The effects on the joints and tube material were observed. The test was conducted on a test segment of manifold designed to duplicate two of the flexible elbows; the transition joints between the elbows and the tubular module inner clad; and the welded joints of the elbows to the primary loop header. The assembled test segment and hold-down bracket are shown. The bracket was mounted {{to the base of the}} Universal Test Machine. Dial indicators measured the relative displacement between the line of applied load (through the vertical axis of the primary loop header) and the attachment point at the holddown bracket. In the first test, the load was applied in fifty pound increments until the relative displacement of nine mils was measured between the loop header and the welded joint on the feedline elbow. The remaining tests were cycling the header assembly at increasing relative displace ment. The summary of these tests are tabulated. The testing had no noticeable affect on the structural integrity of the weldment...|$|E
40|$|CO 2 {{exchange}} {{was measured}} {{on the forest}} floor of a coastal temperate Douglas-fir forest located near Campbell River, British Columbia, Canada. Continuous measurements were obtained at six locations using an automated chamber system between April and December, 2000. Fluxes were measured every half hour by circulating chamber headspace air through a sampling <b>manifold</b> <b>assembly</b> and a closed-path infrared gas analyzer. Maximum CO 2 fluxes measured varied by a factor of almost 3 between the chamber locations, while the highest daily average fluxes observed at two chamber locations occasionally reached values near 15 mol C m− 2 s− 1. Generally, fluxes ranged between 2 and 10 mol C m− 2 s− 1 during the measurement period. CO 2 flux from the forest floor was strongly related to soil temperature with the highest correlation found with 5 cm depth temperature. A simple temperature dependent exponential model fit to the nighttime fluxes revealed Q 10 values in the normal range of 2 – 3 during the warmer parts of the year, but values of 4 – 5 during cooler periods. Moss photosynthesis was negligible in four of the six chambers, while at the other locations, it reduced daytime half-hourly net CO 2 flux by about 25 %. Soil moisture had very little effect on forest floor CO 2 flux. Hysteresis in the annual relationship between chamber fluxes and soil temperatures was observed. Net exchange from the six chambers was estimated to be 1920 ± 530 g C m− 2 per year, the higher estimates exceeding measurement of ecosystem respiration using year-round eddy correlation above the canopy at this site. This discrepancy is attributed to the inadequate number of chambers to obtain a reliable estimate of the spatial average soil CO 2 flu...|$|E
40|$|Haernatococcus pluvialis is a flagellated green alga that accumulates large {{quantities}} of the carotenoid astaxanthin. Astaxanthin is commercially important as a aquaculture pigment, and as a human health supplement. Currently the majority of astaxanthin used in aquaculture is synthetic. However recent advances in algal mass culture technology and growing consumer awareness {{about the origins of}} foodstuffs mean that the use of H. pluvialis for the production of astaxanthin may become a viable alternative to synthetically produced astaxanthin. This study focused on the development of a scaleable photobioreactor and a methodology {{that could be used for}} the commercial production of H. pluvialis. Four successive air-lift driven novel tubular photobioreactors (termed TBRI, TBR 2, AAPS™I and AAPS™ 2) were developed for the photosynthetic cultivation of H. pluvialis. Physical assessment revealed that the four systems differed in terms of their mass transfer, gas hold-up, flow rate and photostage turbulence (Reynolds number). The photo stage of each photobioreactor acted as the main area for light absorbance, (analysis of the spectral absorbance of the tubing revealed that it transmitted light of 320 - 820 nm). The AAPS™I and AAPS™ 2 had a manifold photo stage, comprising of three windings. They also had a riser and downcomer of increased length when compared to TBRI and TBR 2. This increased the bulk density difference between these stages and resulted in an increased fluid flow rate and consequently improved turbulence within the photostage. As well as being longer, the riser of the AAPSTM systems also had an increased diameter. This, combined with the improved gas hold-up of the systems, increased the mass transfer of the AAPSTM 1 and AAPS™ 2. The <b>manifold</b> <b>assembly</b> also allowed the construction of a larger volume photo stage while frequently returning the cells to the riser/header tank where gas exchange occurred. This prevented the detrimental build-up of photosynthetic 0 ₂...|$|E
40|$|To insure safe {{performance}} during the launch and {{flight of the}} W 79 Artillery Fired Atomic Projectile (AFAP), the assembly gaps in the high explosive assembly were filled with a continuous film of polyurethane elastomer adhesive called Halthane 73 - 18. To disassemble bonded weapons like the W 79, Lawrence Livermore and Mason & Hanger, Pantex Plant have developed a chemical dissolution process that safely removes the high explosive, thereby facilitating {{the recovery of the}} pit. The solvent of choice for the W 79 AFAP was dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). In the W 79 dissolution process, a continuous spray of DMSO is emitted through nozzles mounted in <b>manifold</b> <b>assembly</b> that encircles the HE assembly. The operating pressure and temperature of the DMSO are less than 100 psig and less than 160 {degrees}F. Although warm DMSO readily dissolves the LX- 10 {sup 1 } explosive, it cannot dissolve the Halthane 73 - 18 adhesive due to its chemically crosslinked structure. DMSO does, however, swell the Halthane adhesive. The resulting swollen films are soft and unable to support their own weight, yet they are not necessarily so fragile that they will tear or shred readily under the force of the DMSO spray. Indeed, the swollen Halthane films encountered in several W 79 Type 6 B 2048 units tested in the Pantex Workstation proved to be quite tenacious. They remained intact under the action of DMSO spray and became an encapsulating barrier that shielded the remaining undissolved HE. This effectively stopped the dissolution process, forcing manual removal in order to complete the dissolution process. By comparison, the swollen Halthane film was readily shredded and eliminated under the action of the DMSO spray nozzles in tests at LLNL in workstation of a different design. This apparent difference in response {{is the subject of this}} report...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} developing novel Contact-State (CS) modeling, control strategy, {{and environment}} position localization (position searching) for force-guided robotic assembly processes of rigid and flexible objects. For the CS modeling, the wrench (Cartesian force and torque) signals of the manipulated object are captured for different {{phases of the}} considered assembly processes and using the Expectation Maximization-based Gaussian Mixtures Model (EM-GMM), a recognizer is developed for each CS of the assembly. The suggested EM-GMM CS modeling scheme is shown to have excellent Classification Success Rate (CSR) with reduced computational efforts. For the control part, it is shown throughout the thesis that a force-guided robotic assembly process is a hybrid nonlinear system with arbitrary switching signal resulted from the constraints arbitrary switching during the assembly. Furthermore, the robot dynamics is frequently unknown, which {{is the case in}} many industrial robots, that would make the force-guided robotic assembly process to be an unknown hybrid nonlinear system with arbitrary switching. In order to overcome such a control challenge, a Decentralized Robust Adaptive Fuzzy Control (DRAFC) strategy is derived that guarantees stable performance under constraints arbitrary switching and unknown dynamics. For the environment position localization, the EM-GMM CS modeling scheme is integrated with a spiral search path and the precise hole position is identified for cases of position uncertainty. Experiments are conducted on a KUKA Lightweight Robot (LWR) doing different force-guided assembly tasks for rigid and flexible objects. Excellent performance is reported for the proposed EM-GMM CS recognition scheme, the DRAFC strategy, and the suggested position searching algorithm. The suggested EM-GMM CS recognition, DRAFC strategy, and position localization schemes are compared with the availably corresponding schemes and the superiority of the suggested schemes is shown. The reasons behind the superiority of the EM-GMM CS recognition scheme are the accommodation of the captured signals non-stationary behavior, employing optimized number of GMM components in the modeling process, and employing the EM algorithm that iteratively increases the log-likelihood. The causes behind the superiority of the DRAFC strategy are addressing the unknown nonlinear dynamics of the robot, accommodating the constraints arbitrary switching, and the robustness against possible dynamics parameters drift. The reasons behind the surpassing of the suggested position localization strategy are the robustness against the surface roughness and reduced computational efforts. The proposed EM-GMM CS modeling scheme, DRAFC strategy, and position searching scheme are applied to the entire peg-in-hole assembly processes of rigid and flexible objects. Excellent Localization Success Rate (LSR) was resulted when using the suggested schemes. Furthermore, the proposed CS modeling scheme, control strategy, and localization approach are applied to a couple of applications in automotive industry; the first one is the camshaft caps assembly of a cylinder head and the other is the air-intake <b>manifold</b> <b>assembly</b> of a powertrain. Efficient force-guided robotic assembly processes are obtained for both considered applications...|$|E
40|$|The High-Flow Jet Exit Rig at the NASA Glenn Research Center is {{designed}} to test single flow jet nozzles and to measure the appropriate thrust and noise levels. The rig has been designed for the maximum hot condition of 16 lbm/sec of combustion air at 1960 R (maximum) and to produce a maximum thrust of 2000 lb. It was designed for cold flow of 29. 1 lbm/sec of air at 530 R. In addition, it can test dual-flow nozzles (nozzles with bypass flow in addition to core flow) with independent control of each flow. The High- Flow Jet Exit Rig was successfully fabricated in late 2001 and is being readied for checkout tests. The rig will be installed in Glenn's Aeroacoustic Propulsion Laboratory. The High-Flow Jet Exit Rig consists of the following major components: a single component force balance, the natural-gas-fueled J- 79 combustor assembly, the plenum and <b>manifold</b> <b>assembly,</b> an acoustic/instrumentation/seeding (A/I/S) section, a table, and the research nozzles. The rig will be unique in that it {{is designed}} to operate uncooled. The structure survives the 1960 R test condition because it uses carefully selected high temperature alloy materials such as Hastelloy-X. The lower plenum assembly was designed to operate at pressures to 450 psig at 1960 R, in accordance with the ASME B 31. 3 piping code. The natural gas-fueled combustor fires directly into the lower manifold. The hot air is directed through eight 1 - 1 / 2 -in. supply pipes that supply the upper plenum. The flow is conditioned in the upper plenum prior to flowing to the research nozzle. The 1 - 1 / 2 -in. supply lines are arranged in a U-shaped design to provide for a flexible piping system. The combustor assembly checkout was successfully conducted in Glenn's Engine Component Research Laboratory in the spring of 2001. The combustor is a low-smoke version of the J 79 combustor used to power the F 4 Phantom military aircraft. The natural gas-fueled combustor demonstrated high-efficiency combustion over a wide range of operating conditions. This wide operating envelope is required to support the testing of both single- and dual-flow nozzles. Key research goals include providing simultaneous, highly accurate acoustic, flow, and thrust measurements on jet nozzle models in realistic flight conditions, as well as providing scaleable acoustic results. The High-Flow Jet Exit Rig is a second-generation high-flow test rig. Improvements include cleaner flow with reduced levels of particulate, soot, and odor. Choked-flow metering is required with plus or minus 0. 25 -percent accuracy. Thrust measurements from 0 to 2000 lbf are required with plus or minus 0. 25 -percent accuracy. Improved acoustics will be achieved by minimizing noise through large pipe bend radii, lower internal flow velocities, and microdrilled choke plates with thousands of 0. 040 -in. - diameter holes...|$|E
