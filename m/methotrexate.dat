5|$|Another {{example of}} the {{structural}} similarity of some inhibitors to the substrates of the enzymes they target {{is seen in the}} figure comparing the drug <b>methotrexate</b> to folic acid. Folic acid is a substrate of dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme involved in making nucleotides that is potently inhibited by <b>methotrexate.</b> <b>Methotrexate</b> blocks the action of dihydrofolate reductase and thereby halts the production of nucleotides. This block of nucleotide biosynthesis is more toxic to rapidly growing cells than non-dividing cells, since a rapidly growing cell has to carry out DNA replication, therefore <b>methotrexate</b> is often used in cancer chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Cure {{of a solid}} cancer: In 1956, Min Chiu Li, who {{was educated}} {{and worked in the}} USA after leaving China because of the {{communist}} takeover, and Roy Hertz, demonstrated that systemic chemotherapy could result in the cure of a widely metastatic malignant disease by his use of <b>methotrexate</b> to cure women of choriocarcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Anti-inflammatory {{drugs are}} often used to control the effects of inflammation. Glucocorticoids are the most {{powerful}} of these drugs; however, these drugs can have many undesirable side effects, such as central obesity, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, and their use must be tightly controlled. Lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs {{are often used}} in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as <b>methotrexate</b> or azathioprine.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{of primary}} {{progressive}} multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is problematic as many patients {{do not respond}} to any available therapy, and no treatment has been approved specifically for use in this form of the disease. There have been several trials investigating the efficacy of different drugs for PPMS without positive results. Drugs tested include interferon beta, mitoxantrone, glatiramer acetate or riluzole. People with PPMS have also been included in trials of azathioprine, <b>methotrexate,</b> intravenous immunoglobulin, cyclophosphamide and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.|$|E
5|$|A {{competitive}} inhibitor and substrate cannot bind to {{the enzyme}} {{at the same}} time. Often competitive inhibitors strongly resemble the real substrate of the enzyme. For example, the drug <b>methotrexate</b> is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. The similarity between the structures of dihydrofolate and this drug are shown in the accompanying figure. This type of inhibition can be overcome with high substrate concentration. In some cases, the inhibitor can bind to a site other than the binding-site of the usual substrate and exert an allosteric effect to change {{the shape of the}} usual binding-site.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is known}} to {{interact}} with other drugs. For example, acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs. Aspirin {{is known to}} displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, warfarin, <b>methotrexate,</b> phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, {{an important part of}} valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin. Ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention. The pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking aspirin, and it is known to compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion. Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C.|$|E
5|$|Since inhibitors {{modulate}} {{the function}} of enzymes they are often used as drugs. Many such drugs are reversible competitive inhibitors that resemble the enzyme's native substrate, similar to <b>methotrexate</b> above; other well-known examples include statins used to treat high cholesterol, and protease inhibitors used to treat retroviral infections such as HIV. A common example of an irreversible inhibitor that {{is used as a}} drug is aspirin, which inhibits the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes that produce the inflammation messenger prostaglandin. Other enzyme inhibitors are poisons. For example, the poison cyanide is an irreversible enzyme inhibitor that combines with the copper and iron in the active site of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase and blocks cellular respiration.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} psoriasis; however, various {{treatments}} can help control the symptoms. These treatments include steroid creams, vitamin D3 cream, ultraviolet light and immune system suppressing medications, such as <b>methotrexate.</b> About 75 percent of cases can be managed with creams alone. The disease affects two to four percent of the population. Men and women are affected with equal frequency. The disease may begin at any age, but typically starts in adulthood. Psoriasis is {{associated with an increased}} risk of psoriatic arthritis, lymphomas, cardiovascular disease, Crohn's disease and depression. Psoriatic arthritis affects up to 30 percent of individuals with psoriasis.|$|E
25|$|Penicillins may {{decrease}} {{the elimination of}} <b>methotrexate,</b> so {{increase the risk of}} toxicity. While they may be used together, increased monitoring is recommended. The aminoglycosides, neomycin and paromomycin, have been found to reduce gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of <b>methotrexate.</b> Probenecid inhibits <b>methotrexate</b> excretion, which increases the risk of <b>methotrexate</b> toxicity. Likewise, retinoids and trimethoprim have been known to interact with <b>methotrexate</b> to produce additive hepatotoxicity and haematotoxicity, respectively. Other immunosuppressants like ciclosporin may potentiate methotrexate's haematologic effects, hence potentially leading to toxicity. NSAIDs have also been found to fatally interact with <b>methotrexate</b> in numerous case reports. Nitrous oxide potentiating the haematological toxicity of <b>methotrexate</b> has also been documented. Proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole and the anticonvulsant valproate have been found to increase the plasma concentrations of <b>methotrexate,</b> as have nephrotoxic agents such as cisplatin, the GI drug colestyramine, and dantrolene.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{norfloxacin}} concomitantly {{has also}} been associated with transient elevations in serum creatinine in patients receiving cyclosporine, on rare occasions, resulted in severe hypoglycemia with sulfonylurea. Renal tubular transport of <b>methotrexate</b> may be inhibited by concomitant administration of norfloxacin, potentially leading to increased plasma levels of <b>methotrexate.</b> This might {{increase the risk of}} <b>methotrexate</b> toxic reactions.|$|E
25|$|The {{concomitant}} use of <b>methotrexate,</b> in particular, {{may lead}} to severe or even fatal liver-damage or hepatotoxicity. Seventy-five percent of all cases of severe liver damage reported until early 2001 were seen under combined drug therapy leflunomide plus <b>methotrexate.</b> However, some {{studies have shown that}} the combination of <b>methotrexate</b> and leflunomide in patients with rheumatoid arthritis gave better results than either drug alone.|$|E
25|$|In {{generalised}} non-organ-threatening disease, remission can {{be induced}} with <b>methotrexate</b> and steroids, where the steroid dose is reduced after a remission {{has been achieved}} and <b>methotrexate</b> used as maintenance.|$|E
25|$|A 2015 Cochrane review found {{rituximab}} with <b>methotrexate</b> to {{be effective}} in improving symptoms compared to <b>methotrexate</b> alone. Rituximab works by depicting levels of B-cells (immune cell that is involved in inflammation). People taking rituximab had improved pain, function, reduced disease activity and reduced joint damage based on x-ray images. After 6 months, 21% more people had improvement in their symptoms using rituximab and <b>methotrexate.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Methotrexate</b> is an {{antimetabolite}} of the antifolate type. It {{is thought}} to affect cancer and rheumatoid arthritis by two different pathways. For cancer, <b>methotrexate</b> competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme that participates in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis. The affinity of <b>methotrexate</b> for DHFR is about 1000-fold that of folate. DHFR catalyses the conversion of dihydrofolate to the active tetrahydrofolate. Folic acid is needed for the denovo synthesis of the nucleoside thymidine, required for DNA synthesis. Also, folate is essential for purine and pyrimidine base biosynthesis, so synthesis will be inhibited. <b>Methotrexate,</b> therefore, inhibits the synthesis of DNA, RNA, thymidylates, and proteins.|$|E
25|$|Not {{everyone}} with rheumatoid arthritis responds favorably to treatment with <b>methotrexate,</b> but multiple studies and reviews {{showed that the}} majority of people receiving <b>methotrexate</b> for up to one year had less pain, functioned better, had fewer swollen and tender joints, and had less disease activity overall as reported by themselves and their doctors. X-rays also showed that the progress of the disease slowed or stopped in many people receiving <b>methotrexate,</b> with the progression being completely halted in about 30% of those receiving the drug. Those individuals with rheumatoid arthritis treated with <b>methotrexate</b> have been found to have a lower risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) and strokes.|$|E

25|$|Medical {{abortion}} used to {{be available}} in Canada but on a limited basis using <b>methotrexate</b> and misoprostol. Clinical trials were done in 2000 in various Canadian cities comparing <b>methotrexate</b> to mifepristone, after approbation by the federal government. While both drugs had overall similar results, mifepristone was found to act faster. Health Canada gave approval to mifepristone in July 2015.|$|E

25|$|In 1947, {{a team of}} {{researchers}} led by Sidney Farber showed aminopterin, a chemical analogue of folic acid developed by Yellapragada Subbarao of Lederle, could induce remission in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The development of folic acid analogues had been prompted by the discovery that the administration of folic acid worsened leukemia, and that a diet deficient in folic acid could, conversely, produce improvement; the mechanism of action behind these effects was still unknown at the time. Other analogues of folic acid were in development, and by 1950, <b>methotrexate</b> (then known as amethopterin) was being proposed as a treatment for leukemia. Animal studies published in 1956 showed the therapeutic index of <b>methotrexate</b> was better than that of aminopterin, and clinical use of aminopterin was thus abandoned in favor of <b>methotrexate.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Methotrexate</b> {{is another}} {{immunosuppressive}} drug. It works by inhibiting folic acid, which {{is necessary for}} DNA replication and, therefore, cell division.|$|E
25|$|Recently, use of <b>methotrexate</b> in {{combination}} with anti-TNF agents {{has been shown to}} be effective for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.|$|E
25|$|Several drugs induce hypogonadism, {{for example}} {{aromatase}} inhibitors used in breast cancer, <b>methotrexate</b> and other antimetabolite drugs, depot progesterone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methotrexate</b> is a folate anti-metabolite {{drug that}} is also used for chemotherapy. It is useful in {{maintenance}} of remission for those no longer taking corticosteroids.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{drugs are}} considered as DMARDs: <b>methotrexate,</b> hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, TNF-alpha inhibitors (certolizumab, infliximab and etanercept), abatacept, and anakinra. Rituximab and tocilizumab are monoclonal antibodies {{and are also}} DMARDs.|$|E
25|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{may be used}} {{to treat}} musculoskeletal symptoms. For individuals with severe complications, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs may be prescribed, and sometimes IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin). Also, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as <b>methotrexate</b> may be helpful. Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) is another option and is generally considered safer than <b>methotrexate.</b> However, these prescribed drugs have a range of side effects such as nausea, loss of appetite, dizziness, hair loss, stomach aches/cramps, headache, liver toxicity, and increased risk of infections. Also, people who take drugs to suppress the immune system are more likely to develop cancer later.|$|E
25|$|The anti-folates include <b>methotrexate</b> and pemetrexed. <b>Methotrexate</b> {{inhibits}} {{dihydrofolate reductase}} (DHFR), an enzyme that regenerates tetrahydrofolate from dihydrofolate. When the enzyme is inhibited by <b>methotrexate,</b> the cellular levels of folate coenzymes diminish. These {{are required for}} thymidylate and purine production, which are both essential for DNA synthesis and cell division. Pemetrexed is another anti-metabolite that affects purine and pyrimidine production, and therefore also inhibits DNA synthesis. It primarily inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase, but also has effects on DHFR, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. The fluoropyrimidines include fluorouracil and capecitabine. Fluorouracil is a nucleobase analogue that is metabolised in cells to form at least two active products; 5-fluourouridine monophosphate (FUMP) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate (fdUMP). FUMP becomes incorporated into RNA and fdUMP inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase; both of which lead to cell death. Capecitabine is a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil that is broken down in cells to produce the active drug. The deoxynucleoside analogues include cytarabine, gemcitabine, decitabine, azacitidine, fludarabine, nelarabine, cladribine, clofarabine, and pentostatin. The thiopurines include thioguanine and mercaptopurine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methotrexate</b> is an {{abortifacient}} and {{is commonly}} used to terminate pregnancies during the early stages, generally in combination with misoprostol. It {{is also used to}} treat ectopic pregnancies, provided the fallopian tube has not ruptured.|$|E
25|$|When eczema is {{severe and}} does not respond {{to other forms of}} treatment, {{systemic}} immunosuppressants are sometimes used. Immunosuppressants can cause significant side effects and some require regular blood tests. The most commonly used are ciclosporin, azathioprine, and <b>methotrexate.</b>|$|E
25|$|Central {{nervous system}} {{reactions}} to <b>methotrexate</b> have been reported, especially when given via the intrathecal route (directly into the cerebrospinal fluid), which include myelopathies and leucoencephalopathies. It has {{a variety of}} cutaneous side effects, particularly when administered in high doses.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{treatment for}} GPA is cyclophosphamide and high dose corticosteroids for remission induction and less toxic immunosuppressants like azathioprine, leflunomide, <b>methotrexate</b> or mycophenolate mofetil. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole {{may also help}} prevent relapse. Rituximab may be substituted for cyclophosphamide in inducing remission.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methotrexate</b> was {{originally}} developed {{and continues to}} be used for chemotherapy, either alone or in combination with other agents. It is effective for the treatment of a number of cancers, including: breast, head and neck, leukemia, lymphoma, lung, osteosarcoma, bladder, and trophoblastic neoplasms.|$|E
