There is solid evidence {{that the level of}} physical exercise is associated to improved outcome in BC patients, included cancer related and total mortality (Ballard-Barbash et al. 2012). Therefore, the present study adds to the growing literature for exercise training as a valid, safe and additive therapeutic strategy in cancer patients.|$|R

30|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is now {{recognized}} {{to play an}} important physiological role in animals either as a regulator, involved in signal transduction mechanisms, or as a toxic or protective molecule depending on the concentration and the tissue where it is acting (Feng et al. 2016; Gao et al. 2016; Millar and Day 1997; Wendehenne et al. 2001; Wink et al. 1997; Zhao 2015). In plants, although NO research is more recent than in animal, <b>mounting</b> <b>evidences</b> suggest that NO plays important roles in diverse physiological processes such as growth and development (Laxalt et al. 1997), plant disease resistance (Noritake et al. 1996), abiotic stress (Delledonne et al. 1998), and signal transition (Durner et al. 1998).|$|R
40|$|Nitric oxide {{is known}} {{to act as a}} {{biological}} messenger in divers signal transduction pathways in animal organisms. Initial investigations suggest that plants use nitric oxide as a signaling molecule via pathways remarkably similar to those found in mammals. Especially, the siganiling role of NO during plant defense reactions is well established. However, <b>mounting</b> <b>evidences</b> support the hypothesis that NO is a more general effector of plant growth and development. In our laboratory, alfalfa cell cultures were used to investigate the possible involvement of NO in the regulation of cell division and differentiation in plant cells.

40|$|Abstract Aging is {{associated}} with a greatly increased incidence of a number of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These conditions are associated with chronic inflammation, which generates oxygen reactive species, ultimately responsible for a process known as oxidative stress. It is well established that this process is the culprit of neurodegeneration, and there are also <b>mounting</b> <b>evidences</b> that it is not restricted to the central nervous system. Indeed, several studies, including some by our group, have demonstrated that increased peripheral oxidative stress markers are associated to aging and, more specifically, to AD. Therefore, it is very instigating to regard aging and AD as systemic conditions that might be determined by studying peripheral markers of oxidative stress...|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, {{phentermine}} {{had been}} FDA approved in 1959 and fenfluramine in 1973.

Fen-phen was born and rapidly became the most commonly prescribed diet medication. Dexfenfluramine (Redux) was developed in the mid-1990s as an alternative to fenfluramine with fewer side-effects, and received regulatory approval in 1996. However, this coincided with <b>mounting</b> <b>evidence</b> that the combination could cause valvular heart disease in up to 30% of those who had taken it, leading to withdrawal of Fen-phen and dexfenfluramine from the market in September 1997.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Autophagy and {{endocytosis}} are two evolutionarily conserved catabolic {{processes that}} comprise vesicle traffick-ing events for the clearance of the sequestered intracellular and extracellular cargo. Both start differently but {{end in the}} same compartment, the lysosome. <b>Mounting</b> <b>evidences</b> from the last years have established the involvement of proteins sensitive to intracellular Ca 2 + in {{the control of the}} early autophagic steps and in the traffic of autophagic, endocytic and lysosomal vesicles. However, this knowledge is based on dispersed outcomes that do not set up a consensus model of the Ca 2 +-dependent control of autophagy and endocytosis. Here, we will provide a critical synopsis of insights from the last decade on the involvement of Ca 2 +-sensor proteins in the activation of autophagy and in fusion events of endocytic vesicles, autophagosomes and lysosomes...|$|R
25|$|While {{there is}} {{currently}} little evidence to support this (and <b>mounting</b> <b>evidence</b> to refute it), some early studies implicated the Ephs to {{play a part in}} the signaling of limb development. In chicks, EphA4 is expressed in the developing wing and leg buds, {{as well as in the}} feather and scale primordia. This expression is seen in the distal end of the limb buds, where cells are still undifferentiated and dividing, and appears to be under the regulation of retinoic acid, FGF2, FGF4, and BMP-2 – known to regulate limb patterning. EphA4 defective mice do not present abnormalities in limb morphogenesis (personal communication between Andrew Boyd and Nigel Holder), so it is possible that these expression patterns are related to neuronal guidance or vascularisation of the limb with further studies being required to confirm or deny a potential role of Eph in limb development.|$|E
25|$|Kaspar, {{a social}} robot, has been {{designed}} by the University of Hertfordshire's Adaptive Systems Research Group (ASRG). The Kaspar project began in 2005, drawing upon previous researches to develop a social robot for engaging autistic children {{in a variety of}} play scenarios.The aim was to research whether interacting and communicating with Kaspar would help children with autism interact and communicate more easily with people. This is important because there is <b>mounting</b> <b>evidence</b> that early intervention for children with autism may change the child's development trajectory. Kaspar is a research tool with programmed responses adapted to be used by an autistic child in a safe, non-judgemental environment. The Kaspar research has shown that robots may provide a safe and predictable tool for children with autism, that enables the children to learn social interaction and communication skills, addressing specific therapeutic and educational objectives (for example, being able to engage in direct eye-contact or shared eye-gaze), in an enjoyable play context.|$|E
25|$|As <b>mounting</b> <b>evidence,</b> {{from all}} sorts of {{intelligence}} sources and from observation of ground movements, indicated that the Germans were suffering desperate local shortages, the tactical air forces intensified their attacks on oil trains and storage dumps near the front lines. The Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces showed improvement {{in the use of}} H2X radar devices, and RAF Bomber Command was employing Gee-H to better advantage as its crews became more experienced. It was discovered that synthetic oil plants lent themselves to successful air attacks more easily than oil refineries, since the former could be put out of action by relatively small damage to critical parts of their complicated machinery. Furthermore, the synthetic plants were much larger than the refineries and were more likely to appear on radar screens because they usually stood some distance outside of cities. The 15AF sharply raised its level of accuracy and developed techniques, {{such as the use of}} diamond-shaped formations, which ensured more safety for the bombers as well as greater precision in attack.|$|E
40|$|Sterols play multi-faceted {{roles in}} all eukaryotes. In plants, there are <b>mounting</b> <b>evidences</b> {{pointing}} to sterols, other than BRs, {{can act as}} signaling molecules. The Arabidopsis dry 2 /sqe 1 - 5 mutant has multiple developmental defects caused by a point mutation in the SQE 1 gene that generates a hypomorphic allele. SQE 1 encodes a squalene epoxidase, which converts squalene into 2, 3 -oxidosqualene the precursor of plant sterols. Genetic, molecular and biochemical analyses suggest that dry 2 /sqe 1 - 5 defective phenotypes cannot be simply explained by a depletion of bulk sterols but rather by altered ROS. It remains to be elucidated whether the altered ROS production of the mutant is caused by membrane composition, which in turn affect the lipid rafts composition and/or an altered signaling...|$|R
