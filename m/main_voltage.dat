Typical arc lamps operate at a voltage high enough to maintain the certain current level for which the lamp was designed to operate. This is often {{in the range of}} 10 to 50 amps. Due to their very high pressures, arc lamps require specially designed circuitry for start up, or [...] "striking" [...] the arc. Striking usually occurs in three phases. In the triggering phase, an extremely high voltage pulse from the [...] "series triggering" [...] transformer creates a spark streamer between the electrodes, but the impedance is too high for the <b>main</b> <b>voltage</b> to take over. A [...] "boost voltage" [...] phase is then initiated, where a voltage that is higher than the voltage drop between the electrodes is driven through the lamp, until the gas is heated to a plasma state.

The HSB (Hardware Store Busy) pin externally initiates a non-volatile hardware store operation. Using the HSB signal, which requests a non-volatile hardware STORE cycle, is optional.

50|$|This {{standby voltage}} is {{generated}} by a smaller power supply inside the unit. In older PSU designs, {{it was used to}} supply the voltage regulator, located on the low-voltage side of the transformer, allowing the regulator to measure output voltages. The regulator controls the switching transistors insulated by optocouplers or pulse transformers. The standby power source was a small linear power supply with conventional transformer, which was later changed to a switching power supply, sharing some components of the main unit due to cost- and energy-saving requirements. This 5VSB (Five Volts StandBy) power output feeds devices operating in standby or power off {{is generated by}} this small circuit, which replaced a small conventional transformer or startup circuit for the <b>main</b> <b>voltage</b> regulator, until it can generate power output, in some designs feeding itself and substituting the 5VSB. For this reason, a detected shoutcut may cause to wait up to an hour, until it can successful power up again.

50|$|In {{the early}} twenty-first century, {{switched-mode}} power supplies (SMPSs) became almost ubiquitous for this purpose. <b>Mains</b> <b>voltage</b> is rectified to a high direct voltage driving a switching circuit, which contains a transformer operating at a high frequency and outputs direct current at the desired voltage. The high-frequency ripple is more easily filtered out than mains-frequency. The high frequency allows the transformer to be small, which reduces its losses; and the switching regulator can be much more efficient than a linear regulator. The result {{is a much more}} efficient, smaller, and lighter device. Safety is ensured, as in the older linear circuit, because there is still a transformer which electrically isolates the output from the mains.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} inward {{currents}} that help produce action potentials and bursts in pacemaker neurons. There are two <b>main</b> <b>voltage</b> dependent sodium currents {{that contribute to}} the depolarization and firing of action potentials in neurons. The fast and transient sodium current produces a large depolarization that fires the initial action potential in neurons, however this current is quickly inactivated and does not help maintain bursting activity in neurons. [...] To achieve bursts, a persistent sodium current provides enough depolarization to facilitate the firing of action potentials during a burst. [...] Unlike the fast and transient sodium current, the persistent sodium current (INaP) is activated at very low membrane potentials and has a much slower inactivation, which allows neurons to intrinsically fire action potentials at sub-threshold membrane potentials. [...] Studies have shown that the inactivation of this persistent sodium current helps end bursts in pacemaker neurons. The amount of time it takes for INaP to become activated again establishes the timeframe between each burst. The neuron can receive synaptic inputs and different amounts of inward and outward currents to regulate the time between each burst, which ultimately helps generate a specific breathing pattern.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} modifications that debuted during STS-118 is an upgraded power-distribution module, the Station-Shuttle Power Transfer System (SSPTS). SSPTS allows Endeavour to tap into the ISS power supply, converting up to eight kilowatts of electrical power from 120-volts direct-current (120VDC) ISS <b>main</b> <b>voltage</b> to the 28VDC system used by the orbiter. SSPTS was outfitted to the ISS Pressurized Mating Adapter-2 (PMA2) during STS-116. These upgrades will allow orbiters to remain docked at the station for an additional three to four mission days by saving cryogenic liquid hydrogen and oxygen needed to run the fuel cells which generate electricity aboard the orbiter; oxygen and hydrogen tank capacity is a major factor limiting the duration of orbiter free flights. Other systems debuting on this flight were a three-string GPS system, which replaces the three Tactical Air Navigation-units, used to guide the shuttle and calculate its position during reentry and landing and the new Advanced Health Management System which keeps an eye on the three main engines (SSMEs) during liftoff and will shut them down before any catastrophic damage might develop. (All SSMEs had their own computers to regulate, monitor, and shut them down in case of trouble; the new system extends and improves the monitoring capability for increased safety.) Endeavour also received several systems that the other orbiters had already been equipped with, such as a glass cockpit, improved wing leading-edge sensors and the OBSS.|$|E

40|$|The firing {{characteristics}} of the simple triggered vacuum gap (TVG) using lead zirconate titanate as dielectric material in the triggered gap are described. This TVG has a long life of about 2000 firings without appreciable deterioration of the electrical properties for main discharge currents upto 3 kA and is much superior to these made with Supramica (Mycalex Corporation of America) and silicon carbide as used in our earlier investigations. The effects of the variation of trigger voltage, trigger curcit, trigger pulse duration, trigger pulse energy, <b>main</b> gap <b>voltage,</b> <b>main</b> gap separation and main circuit energy on the firing characteristics have been studied.

40|$|Existing {{voltage control}} {{methods have been}} {{developed}} considering unidirectional power flow, and the power flow direction has been assumed to be from substation toward consumption points. In unidirectional power flow environment, undervoltage {{is considered to be}} the <b>main</b> <b>voltage</b> quality problem. However, increasing trend of integration of distributed generation (DG) such as solar and wind power to the grid has created possibility for bidirectional power flow and also emerging voltage rise as another voltage quality problem. Therefore, the previous control methods are not capable of efficient handling of the voltage problems and {{there is a need for}} development of new control methods. Since transformers are the <b>main</b> <b>voltage</b> control resources and are owned by the system operator, the main focus in this thesis is on the voltage control using on-load tap changer (OLTC) transformers and especially on the coordinated operation of cascaded transformers. A centralized unit (algorithm) called Block OLTCs of Transformers (BOT) is defined for this purpose. The system operator can use the BOT in two different control schemes. In the first scheme, the BOT acts as a standalone unit that enhances the voltage quality by coordinating the cascaded transformers. In the second control scheme, the BOT unit acts as a supplementary algorithm for other voltage control algorithms (integrated operation) which again aims to improve the voltage quality by coordinating the cascaded OLTCs. The standalone operation of the BOT is the integral part of this thesis. However, integrated operation is also explained. Performance of the BOT in standalone operation is widely tested and compared with the local control methods of cascaded OLTCs. The obtained results indicate that the BOT is able to prevent unnecessary tap actions of the cascaded OLTCs. This leads to a reduction in total number of tap operations and as a result an improvement in the supply quality regardless of power flow direction is achieved...|$|E
