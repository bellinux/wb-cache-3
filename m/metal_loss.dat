40|$|Nowadays, {{a higher}} demand {{on a lot}} of metals exists, but the {{quantity}} and purity of the ores decreases. The amount of scrap, on the other hand, increases and thus, recycling becomes more important. Besides recycling, it is also necessary to improve and optimize existing processes in extractive and recycling metallurgy. One of the main difficulties of the overall‐plant recovery are <b>metal</b> <b>losses</b> in slags, in both primary and secondary metal production. In general, an increased understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing these losses could help further improve production efficiencies. This review aims to summarize and evaluate the current scientific knowledge concerning <b>metal</b> <b>losses</b> and pinpoints the knowledge gaps. First, the industrial importance and impact of <b>metal</b> <b>losses</b> in slags will be illustrated by several examples from both ferrous and non‐ferrous industries. Throughout the remainder of this review, the main focus will be put on the particular issues in copper industry. In a second section, the different types of <b>metal</b> <b>losses</b> in slags will be discussed. Generally, <b>metal</b> <b>losses</b> in slags can be subdivided into two types: chemical losses and physical losses. The fundamental insights concerning the responsible mechanisms will be discussed for each type. Subsequently, an overview of the most frequently used techniques for research investigations of the losses will be given. In a fourth section, a more detailed overview will be given on the post‐processing treatment of metal‐containing slags, i. e. performing slag cleaning operations. The most frequently applied methods will be discussed. status: accepte...|$|R

50|$|Another major {{difference}} in non-ferrous extraction is the {{greater emphasis on}} minimizing <b>metal</b> <b>losses</b> in slag. This is widely due to the exceptional scarcity and economic value of certain non-ferrous metals which are, inevitably, discarded during the extraction process to some extent. Thus, material resource scarcity and shortages are of great concern to the non-ferrous industry. Recent developments in non-ferrous extractive metallurgy now emphasize the reprocessing and recycling of rare and non-ferrous metals from secondary raw materials (scrap) found in landfills.|$|R
50|$|Flow-accelerated {{corrosion}} (FAC), {{also known}} as flow-assisted corrosion, is a corrosion mechanism in which a normally protective oxide layer on a metal surface dissolves in a fast flowing water.

40|$|The {{base metal}} {{distribution}} in, and losses to, Anglo Platinum six-in-line and slag cleaning furnace slags were characterised {{to coincide with}} various process changes at Waterval Smelter from 1999 to 2009. The base metals are presumed to be reliable indicators of PGE losses and are easier to detect and measure than these elements are. In addition, base metal and sulphur levels are used to monitor and control many smelter processes, including slag cleaning and converting. Some losses to slag are recoverable but others are not – these have been quantified during this study. Slag composition and smelting temperatures have varied substantially, and optimisation of the slag cleaning furnace – a first for the South African platinum industry – has produced a wide variation in oxidation conditions. Most of the base <b>metal</b> <b>losses</b> in the slag cleaning furnace are mechanically entrained matte particles, the largest of which should be recovered. These have been examined to establish any relationship between composition, size, and depth within the furnace so that recommendations {{can be made to}} limit these types of losses. In the six-in-line furnaces, over half of base <b>metal</b> <b>losses</b> to slag are as dissolved phases, which are not recoverable. Levels of dissolved metals have been measured and related to furnace operating conditions and slag composition. The prediction of such base <b>metal</b> <b>losses</b> is not easy, because the slag compositions are so complex. One aspect of the project has been to compare the measured distribution of the base metals with those calculated using the FactSage equilibrium model, to identify problem areas, and to recommend actions which could improve the predictions of this and similar modelling programs for base metal dissolution in slag. New electron microbeam techniques have been developed to quantify base metal distribution in slag, and novel combinations of these techniques with analytical chemistry and Mössbauer Spectroscopy have been pioneered.

5000|$|Typically, an MFL tool {{consists}} {{of two or more}} bodies. One body is the magnetizer with the magnets and sensors and the other bodies contain the electronics and batteries. The magnetizer body houses the sensors that are located between powerful [...] "rare-earth" [...] magnets. The magnets are mounted between the brushes and tool body to create a magnetic circuit along with the pipe wall. As the tool travels along the pipe, the sensors detect interruptions in the magnetic circuit. Interruptions are typically caused by <b>metal</b> <b>loss</b> and which in most cases is corrosion and the dimensions of the potential <b>metal</b> <b>loss</b> is denoted previously as [...] "feature." [...] Other features may be manufacturing defects and not actual corrosion. The feature indication or [...] "reading" [...] includes its length by width by depth as well as the o'clock position of the anomaly/feature. Mechanical damage such as shovel gouges can also be detected. The <b>metal</b> <b>loss</b> in a magnetic circuit is analogous to a rock in a stream. Magnetism needs metal to flow {{and in the absence of}} it, the flow of magnetism will go around, over or under to maintain its relative path from one magnet to another, similar to the flow of water around a rock in a stream. The sensors detect the changes in the magnetic field in the three directions (axial, radial, or circumferential) to characterize the anomaly. The sensors are typically oriented axially which limits data to axial conditions along the length of the pipeline. Other designs of smart pigs can address other directional data readings or have completely different functions than that of a standard MFL tool. Often times an operator will run a series of inspection tools to help verify or confirm MFL readings and visa versa. An MFL tool can take sensor readings based on either the distance the tool travels or on increments of time. The choice depends on many factors such as the length of the run, the speed that the tool intends to travel, and the number of stops or outages that the tool may experience.|$|E
5000|$|Magnetic {{flux leakage}} (،TFI) is a {{magnetic}} method of nondestructive testing {{that is used}} to detect corrosion and pitting in steel structures, most commonly pipelines and storage tanks. The basic principle is that a powerful magnet is used to magnetize the steel. At areas where there is corrosion or missing metal, the magnetic field [...] "leaks" [...] from the steel. In an MFL tool, a magnetic detector is placed between the poles of the magnet to detect the leakage field. Analysts interpret the chart recording of the leakage field to identify damaged areas and to estimate the depth of <b>metal</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E
50|$|Magnetic {{flux leakage}} (MFL) tools use a sensor {{sandwiched}} between multiple powerful magnets {{to create and}} measure the flow of magnetic flux in the pipe wall. Structurally-sound steel has a uniform structure that allows regular flow of the magnetic flux, while anomalies and features interrupt the flow of flux in identifiable patterns; the sensor registers these flow interruptions and records them for later analysis.
