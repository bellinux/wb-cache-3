50|$|Cubosomes are liquid {{crystalline}} nano-structures {{formed from}} the cubic phase of lipids, such as <b>monooleate,</b> {{or any other}} amphiphilic macromolecules with the unique property to be dispersed into particles. In short, the emulsification of the cubic lipid phases in water results in production of cubosomes that {{can be defined as}} nanoparticulate dispersal systems characterized by high biocompatibility and bioadhesivity. They are formed by the mixture of phospholipid (glycerol <b>monooleate)</b> and non-ionic surfactant in aqueous media by applying high energy dispersion such as sonication and homogenization. Nano-vehicles are generated from a self-assembled lipid mixture and studied by means of high-resolution cryogenic transmission electron microscope (cryo-TEM). These structures have been observed to naturally occur in mitochondrial membranes and in stressed cells.|$|E
50|$|The use of biosurfactants {{as a way}} {{to remove}} {{petroleum}} from contaminated sites has been studied and found to be safe and effective in the removal of petroleum products from soil. Other studies found that surfactants are often more toxic than the oil that is being dispersed, and the combination of the oil and the surfactant can be more toxic than either alone. Biosurfactants were not used by BP after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. However, unprecedented amounts of Corexit (active ingredient: dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS), sorbitan <b>monooleate</b> (Span 80), and polyoxyethylenated sorbitan <b>monooleate</b> (Tween-80)), were sprayed directly into the ocean at the leak and on the sea-water's surface, the theory being that the surfactants isolate droplets of oil, making it easier for petroleum-consuming microbes to digest the oil.|$|E

40|$|Organic {{friction}} modifiers {{have long}} been added to oil formulations to help improve lubricity, particularly in the boundary lubrication regime. Many aspects of organic friction modifier behaviour remain unknown. In this thesis these aspects are isolated and probed using numerous different techniques. Organic friction modifiers are amphiphilic molecules comprising a head group and a hydrocarbon chain. The chemistry of the organic friction modifier employed affects the observed film forming properties and frictional behaviour. Factors of interest include {{the effects of the}} head group type and of alkyl chain unsaturation. Commercially employed organic friction modifiers tend to comprise a mono-unsaturated oleyl group. This project deals with the impact this has on organic friction modifier performance. Another area of interest is the behaviour of glycerol <b>monooleate.</b> Glycerol <b>monooleate</b> {{is one of the most}} commercially employed organic friction modifiers and is atypical to model organic friction modifiers in that it has a rather bulky polar moiety. Model organic friction modifiers usually have only one functional group; however, glycerol <b>monooleate</b> has two alcohol groups and an ester group. Although glycerol <b>monooleate</b> is widely employed in oil formulations, many aspects of its behaviour remain uncertain. In this thesis several techniques are used including upscale friction experiments such as High Frequency Reciprocating Rig tests, Ball on Disc pure sliding friction tests and Mini-Traction Machine mixed sliding-rolling tests. Organic friction modifier film formation on ferrous and non-ferrous surfaces is investigated in situ from solution in hydrocarbon solvent using the Atomic Force Microscope. Organic friction modifier films formed on surfaces during friction tests are investigated ex situ by Atomic Force Microscopy and Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy.

Here, we present the phase behavior of phytantriol in water, as determined by X-ray diffraction. At room temperature, the phase sequence upon increasing the water concentration is reversed micellar, lamellar, cubic phase Q(230), and cubic phase Q(224). At 44 degreesC, the cubic liquid crystals are transformed into a reversed hexagonal phase. The temperature-composition phase diagram of phytantriol/water mixtures is, thus, qualitatively similar to that of aqueous glycerol <b>monooleate.</b> The chemical stability of phytantriol makes it an interesting alternative to glycerol <b>monooleate</b> in exploiting various scientific and technical applications of, in particular, the cubic liquid crystalline phases...|$|E
40|$|Smegmatocin, {{a protein}} {{produced}} by Mycobacterium smegmatis ATCC 14468, {{was found to}} have an esterase activity, hydrolyzing Tween 80, polyoxyethylene sorbitan <b>monooleate,</b> added to the assay medium for various "bacteriocins" from mycobacteria. Because M. diernhoferi ATCC 19340 (indicator strain for smegmatocin) is highly susceptible to oleic acid and smegmatocin requires Tween 80 for manifestation of its anti-M. diernhoferi activity, it is likely that smegmatocin-mediated antimicrobial action is caused by oleic acid generated by hydrolysis of Tween 80 by the inherent esterase action of smegmatocin. Other mycobacteriocins from rapidly growing mycobacteria also have inherent esterase activity against Tween 80 and require Tween 80 for expression of antimycobacterial action. Smegmatocin was found to hydrolyze various polyoxyethylene (sorbitan) fatty acyl esters but not sorbitan <b>monooleate</b> and glyceryl esters...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of coconut oil and different surfactants on stability of nanoemulsions that were prepared by simple homogenization (13, 500 rpm, 10 minutes). Coconut oil, sunflower oil and castor oil at the concentration of 20 - 40 % w/w were used as the oil phase. Polysorbate 20, polysorbate 80 and Cremophore RH 40 were used as surfactant whereas sorbitan <b>monooleate</b> and polyethylene glycol 400 were used as co-surfactants. The formulations containing coconut oil in the range of 20 - 40 % w/w and the ratio of polysorbate 80 to sorbitan <b>monooleate</b> of 2 : 1 and 3 : 1 provided nano-sized emulsions (100 - 500 nm). The zeta potential values ranged from- 41. 51 to- 16. 97 mV. The prepared nanoemulsions were stable for at least 7 days at 8 C. The temperature cycling test (storage at 4 C for 24 hours and at 45 C for 24 hours) was performed. It was found that the formulation containing 30 % w/w of coconut oil, 22. 5 % w/w of polysorbate 80 and 7. 5 % w/w of sorbitan <b>monooleate</b> was stable for 1 cycle. The results indicated that a decrease in the concentration of surfactant and an increase in the concentration of oil affected the stability of nanoemulsions...|$|E

Ternary phase diagrams of mixtures of natural lipids (glycerol trioleate, glycerol <b>monooleate,</b> diglycerol <b>monooleate,</b> and lecithin) and water were investigated by means of optical microscopy in polarized light and by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. All systems showed a microemulsion region at high oil content and a large area of coexistence of two liquid crystalline (hexagonal and lamellar) phases. 1 H and 13 C NMR self-diffusion measurements were used to characterize microstructural features of the microemulsions. On water dilution, the two-phase liquid crystalline region transforms into a creamy emulsion area where the droplets of water are stabilized by both the lamellar and the hexagonal phases, as indicated by 2 H NMR measurements. Due to the very effective dispersing action of the two liquid crystalline phases, these emulsions show a high stability toward phase separation...|$|E

40|$|Gaining an {{increased}} {{understanding of the}} toxicity of new lipid nanoparticle formulations such as the class of cubic and hexagonal phase forming nanomaterials called cubosomes&trade; and hexosomes&trade; is crucial for their development as therapeutic agents. Surprisingly, {{the literature on the}} in vitro and in vivo toxicity of cubic and hexagonal phase forming lipid nanoparticles is negligible, despite a rapidly growing number of publications on their potential use in various therapeutic applications. In this work we have developed methods to study the in vitro cytotoxicity of two chemically distinct cubic phase nanoparticle dispersions using the lipids glycerol <b>monooleate</b> and phytantriol respectively. We have found that the toxicity of phytantriol cubosomes is considerably greater than that of glycerol <b>monooleate</b> cubosomes. The increased toxicity of phytantriol appears to result from its greater ability to disrupt the cellular membrane (haemolytic activity) and oxidative stress. This ﬁnding has signiﬁcant impact and can provide useful guidelines for those conducting further research on the use of cubic phase forming lipids for therapeutic and diagnostic applications both in vitro and in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Solid lipid {{nanoparticles}} {{are typically}} spherical {{with an average}} diameter between 1 and 1000 nm. It is an alternative carrier system to tradition colloidal carriers, such as, emulsions, liposomes, and polymeric micro and nanoparticles. Ramipril is an antihypertensive agent used {{in the treatment of}} hypertension. Its oral bioavailability is 28 % and it is rapidly excreted through the renal route. This drug has many side effects such as, postural hypotension, hyperkalemia, and angioedema, when given as an immediate dosage form. To overcome the side effects and to increase the bioavailability of ramipril, solid lipid nanoparticles of ramipril are prepared by using lipids (glyceryl monostearate and glyceryl <b>monooleate)</b> with stabilizers (tween 80, poloxamer 188, and span 20).

40|$|Biological {{membranes}} do {{not only}} occur as planar bilayer structures, but {{depending on the}} lipid composition, can also curve into intriguing threedimensional structures. In order to fully understand the biological implications {{as well as to}} reveal the full potential for applications, e. g. for drug delivery and other biomedical devices, of such structures, well-defined model systems are required. Here, we discuss the formation of lipid nonlamellar liquid crystalline (LC) surface layers spin-coated from the constituting lipids followed by hydration of the lipid layer. We demonstrate that hybrid lipid polymer films can be formed with different properties compared with the neat lipid LC layers. The nanostructure and morphologies of the lipid films formed reflect those in the bulk. Most notably, mixed lipid layers, which are composed of glycerol <b>monooleate</b> and diglycerol <b>monooleate</b> with poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) nanogels, can form films of reverse cubic phases that are capable of responding to temperature stimulus. Owing to the presence of the nanogel particles, changing the temperature not only regulates the hydration of the cubic phase lipid films, but also the lateral organization of the lipid domains within the lipid self-assembled film. This opens up the possibility for new nanostructured materials based on lipid-polymer responsive layers...|$|E

40|$|The {{encapsulation}} {{and release}} of peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, and drugs in nanostructured lipid carriers {{depend on the}} type of the self-assembled liquid-crystalline organization and the structural dimensions of the aqueous and membraneous compartments, which can be tuned by the multicomponent composition of the systems. In this work, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) investigation is performed on the 'melting' transition of the bicontinuous double diamond cubic phase, formed by pure glycerol <b>monooleate</b> (MO), upon progressive inclusion of varying fractions of pharmaceutical-grade glycerol <b>monooleate</b> (GO) in the hydrated system. The self-assembled MO/GO mixtures are found to form diamond (Pn 3 m) inverted cubic, inverted hexagonal (H(II)), and sponge (L(3)) phases at ambient temperature in excess of aqueous medium without heat treatment. Mixing of the inverted-cubic-phase-forming MO and the sponge-phase-forming GO components, in equivalent proportions (50 / 50 w/w), yields an inverted hexagonal (H(II)) phase nanostructured carrier. Scattering models are applied for fitting of the experimental SAXS patterns and identification of the structural changes in the aqueous and lipid bilayer subcompartments. The possibility of transforming, at ambient temperature (20 °C), the bicontinuous cubic nanostructures into inverted hexagonal (H(II)) or sponge (L(3)) mesophases may facilitate novel biomedical applications of the investigated liquid crystalline self-assemblies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGlyceryl <b>monooleate</b> (GMO) is a polar lipid {{that can}} exist in various liquid {{crystalline}} phases {{in the presence}} of different amounts of water. It is regarded as a permeation enhancer due to its amphiphilic property. Various phases of GMO/solvent system containing sodium fluorescein were prepared to compare permeability using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). GMO was melted in a vial in a water bath heated to 45  °C. Propylene glycol and hexanediol were homogeneously dissolved in the melted GMO. Sodium fluorescein in aqueous solution was diluted to various ratios and thoroughly mixed by an ultrasonic homogenizer. Each GMO/Solvent system with fluorescein was applied onto the epidermal side of excised pig skin and incubated overnight. CLSM was performed to observe how the GMO/solvent system in its different phases affect skin permeability. Cubic and lamellar phase formulations enhanced the fluorescein permeation through the stratum corneum. A solution system had the weakest permeability compared to the other two phases. Due to the amphiphilic nature of GMO, cubic and lamellar phases might reduce the barrier function of stratum corneum which was observed by CLSM as fluorescein accumulated in the dermis. Based on the results, the glyceryl <b>monooleate</b> lyotropic mixtures could be applied to enhance skin permeation in various topical and transdermal formulations...|$|E
40|$|Emulsifiers {{are used}} in ice cream to produce a dry, smooth {{textured}} product with desireable melting properties. They function by promoting a partial destabilization of the fat emulsion. Polyoxythylene sorbitan <b>monooleate</b> is used very commonly in the ice cream industry for this purpose. The objective {{of this research was}} to examine by transmission electron microscopy the differences in the fat globules in typical ice cream mix emulsions prepared with and without 0. 08 % polyoxyethylene sorbitan <b>monooleate.</b> Ice cream mix was combined 3 : 1 with a 2 % solultion of ultralow gelling temperature agarose at 20 degrees C, fixed with 4 % glutaraldehyde, postfixed with 1 % OsO 4 in imidazole/phosphate buffer, embedded in Spurr resin and thin-sectioned for viewing. The emulsifier reduced the number of casein micelles adsorbed to the fat globules as determined by both TEM and quantification of membrane protein with Kjeldahl analyses. The fat/Serum interfacial tension was also significantly reduced by the presence of emulsifier in the mix. The data suggest that emulsifiers promote fat destabilization through reduction of membrane protein, based on their ability to reduce the fat serum interfacial tension. In the presence of crystallized fat, the emulsion then becomes less stable to shear forces during the whipping and freezing of ice cream...|$|E
40|$|To {{generate}} nanostructured {{vehicles with}} tunable internal organization, the structural phase {{behavior of a}} self-assembled amphiphilic mixture involving poly(ethylene glycol) <b>monooleate</b> (MO-PEG) and glycerol <b>monooleate</b> (MO) is studied in excess aqueous medium by time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) in the temperature range from 1 to 68 degrees C. The SAXS data indicate miscibility of the two components in lamellar and nonlamellar soft-matter nanostructures. The functionalization of the MO assemblies by a MO-PEG amphiphile, which has a flexible large hydrophilic moiety, appears to hinder the epitaxial growth of a double diamond (D) cubic lattice from the lamellar (L) bilayer structure during the thermal phase transition. The incorporated MO-PEG additive is found to facilitate the formation of structural intermediates. They exhibit greater characteristic spacings and large diffusive scattering in broad temperature and time intervals. Their features are {{compared with those of}} swollen long-living intermediates in MO/octylglucoside assemblies. A conclusion can be drawn that long-living intermediate states can be equilibrium stabilized in two- or multicomponent amphiphilic systems. Their role as cubic phase precursors is to smooth the structural distortions arising from curvature mismatch between flat and curved regions. The considered MO-PEG functionalized assemblies may be useful for preparation of sterically stabilized liquid-crystalline nanovehicles for confinement of therapeutic biomolecules...|$|E
