The first game at the <b>Moss</b> <b>Rose</b> (on the ground {{adjoining}} the then named, <b>Moss</b> <b>Rose</b> Inn) took place on 12 September 1891 and therefore 2011 was the ground's 120th anniversary.

50|$|Undoubtedly, Dot’s most {{successful}} rose (a hybrid spinosissima) was ‘Nevada,’ released in 1927. The great climber ‘Mme Grégoire Staechlin’ {{came out in}} the same year. Given that a breeder often has scores of seedlings to choose from, Dot consistently chose roses with a wilder and more extreme character than their parents'. In that way he has something of the expressionism of his fellow Catalan, Gaudí. Dot also renewed the tradition of <b>moss</b> <b>roses</b> with 'Golden Moss' (1932), the first yellow moss ever bred.|$|R
5000|$|Centifolia roses {{are also}} known as Cabbage roses, or as Provence roses. They are derived from Rosa × centifolia, a hybrid that {{appeared}} in the 17th century in the Netherlands, related to damask roses. They are named for their [...] "one hundred" [...] petals; they are often called [...] "cabbage" [...] roses due to the globular shape of the flowers. The centifolias are all once-flowering. As a class, they are notable for their inclination to produce mutations of various sizes and forms, including <b>moss</b> <b>roses</b> and some of the first miniature roses (see below). Examples: 'Centifolia', 'Paul Ricault'.|$|R

The Macclesfield Times (19 February 1948) reported that 80 coachloads of supporters had arrived from Winsford.|$|E

The Silk FM Stand (traditionally known as the London Road or Main Stand) runs along {{one side of the}} pitch and consists of a seated grandstand with open air terracing to either side, and the opposite side is the seated Alfred McAlpine Stand. The clubs most vociferous supporters congregate in the Star Lane End, which is a mixture of terracing and seating. Visiting supporters are housed in the open air Silkman End (named after a public house which formerly adjoined the terrace) and part of the McAlpine Stand.|$|E
60|$|The English {{public is}} not yet ripe to {{comprehend}} the essential difference between the reason and the understanding--between a principle and a maxim-- an eternal truth and a mere conclusion generalized from {{a great number of}} facts. A man, having seen a million <b>moss</b> <b>roses</b> all red, concludes from his own experience and that of others that all <b>moss</b> <b>roses</b> are red. That is a maxim with him--the greatest amount of his knowledge upon the subject. But it is only true until some gardener has produced a white moss rose,-- after which the maxim is good for nothing. Again, suppose Adam watching the sun sinking under the western horizon for the first time; he is seized with gloom and terror, relieved by scarce a ray of hope that he shall ever see the glorious light again. The next evening, when it declines, his hopes are stronger, but still mixed with fear; and even {{at the end of a}} thousand years, all that a man can feel is a hope and an expectation so strong as to preclude anxiety. Now compare this in its highest degree with the assurance which you have that the two sides of any triangle are together greater than the third. This, demonstrated of one triangle, is seen to be eternally true of all imaginable triangles. This is a truth perceived at once by the intuitive reason, independently of experience. It is and must ever be so, multiply and vary the shapes and sizes of triangles as you may.|$|R

The deep blue of her eyes made even the sky envious, and the <b>moss</b> <b>roses</b> blushed {{when they saw the}} delicate bloom on her cheeks. The long strands of her silken hair were brighter than sunbeams, while her ears were like two tiny pink shells from the seashore. Indeed, there was nothing in all the Valley so dainty and pretty as Princess Pattycake, and many young men would have loved her had they dared. But, alas! the Princess had a most terrible temper, and never was pleased with anything; so the young men, and even the old ones, were afraid to come near her.|$|R
25|$|McIlroy {{took charge}} {{at the start}} of the 1993–94 season, and guided the club to the Football Conference {{championship}} in his second season as manager. However. the club was denied promotion to the Football League because the <b>Moss</b> <b>Rose</b> did not meet league requirements of having a 6,000 total capacity including at least 1,000 seats by the League's deadline of 31 December 1994. Macclesfield Town won the Conference title again two seasons later in 1996–97, by which time the stadium had been upgraded and they were promoted to Division Three of the Football League in place of Hereford United.|$|E
500|$|The Provence rose or Rosa centifolia is {{the full}} and fat [...] "cabbage rose" [...] {{made famous by}} Dutch masters in their 17th-century paintings. These very {{fragrant}} shrub roses grow 5ft tall and wide, with a floppy habit that is aided by training on an arch or pillar. The centifolia roses have produced many descendants that are also cottage garden favorites, including varieties of <b>moss</b> <b>rose</b> (roses with attractive 'mossy' growth on their flower stalks and flower buds). Unlike most modern hybrids, the older roses bloom on the previous year's wood, so they aren't pruned back severely each year. Also as they don't bloom continuously, they can share their branches with later-flowering climbers such as Clematis vines, which use the rose branches for support. A rose in the cottage garden is not segregated with other roses, with bare earth or mulch underneath', but is casually blended with other flowers, vines, and groundcover.|$|E
500|$|Westley {{was born}} in Hounslow, London and he started his footballing career as an {{apprentice}} with Queens Park Rangers. During his time at QPR, Westley represented England at U18 level. He then joined Gillingham in March 1986. He made two Third Division appearances for the club before joining Barnet. He made three appearances and scored one goal {{for them in the}} Football Conference during the 1987–88 season, making his debut for the club in a 2–2 draw against Macclesfield Town at <b>Moss</b> <b>Rose.</b> Westley joined Wycombe Wanderers in the latter stages of 1987 for a fee of £7,500, making a scoring debut in a 2–1 away victory at Telford United. He scored in Wycombe's next two games, and was a first-team regular until manager Peter Suddaby left the club in January 1988. Westley played just once under new manager Jim Kelman and left soon afterwards to sign for Kingstonian. He played 24 times for Wycombe, scoring five goals in all competitions during the club's 1987–88 campaign. [...] He later played for a number of non-League clubs, including Kingstonian, Wealdstone, Farnborough Town, Harlow Town, Enfield, Aylesbury United, Harrow Borough, Tooting & Mitcham United, Molesey and Walton & Hersham – three of which he would later go on to manage. He was voted Player of the Season at Enfield, before being swapped to Aylesbury in exchange for Darren Collins in December 1992. During his time at Kingstonian, he suffered a dislocated ankle and broken leg in three places, which subsequently cut his playing career short as he never fully recovered from the injury.|$|E

In 1940, a diseased <b>rose</b> <b>moss</b> specimen from a private garden in Gananoque, Ontario, {{was sent to the}} Central Laboratory of the Division of Botany and Plant Pathology, at Ottawa, Ontario, for diagnosis.

Artificial inoculation tests on purslane proved it to be pathogenic to that species. That same year, Reeder (40) isolated H. portulacae from diseased purslane plants growing in field plots and in the greenhouse at the University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and the writer isolated the fungus from both hosts in field plots and in a public park at Ste.

50|$|This terrain hollow {{was formed}} about 7000 {{years ago as}} a result of the {{collapse}} of a salt dome that was leached by underground groundwater action - exactly as happened to the Bullenkuhle in the district of Gifhorn. Thanks to stratigraphic research of the bog carried out by Lesemann (1969), we know that, initially, a carr with a covering of peat moss developed on the valley bottom. About 500 years ago there was clearly another collapse which resulted in the creation of two larger sinkholes. These dolines filled with water, the peat <b>moss</b> layer <b>rose</b> and covered the surface of the lake. Today this enclosed, floating layer of grass and peat has a thickness of between 2.5 and 4 metres and is capable of load-bearing. Underneath the eastern sinkhole is a body of water and mud up to 16 metres deep. Even above ground the terrain shows the characteristic relief of a sinkhole: the eastern bog hollow is semi-circular and surrounded by steep walls up to 15 metres high, covered with oak and pine.|$|R
