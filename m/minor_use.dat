5|$|Because it {{is lighter}} than air, {{airships}} and balloons are inflated with helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is more buoyant, and escapes permeating through a membrane {{at a lower}} rate, helium {{has the advantage of}} being non-flammable, and indeed fire-retardant. Another <b>minor</b> <b>use</b> is in rocketry, where helium is used as an ullage medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. It is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program needed about 370,000m3 (13 million cubic feet) of helium to launch.|$|E
5|$|Liquid helium {{is used in}} {{cryogenics}} (its {{largest single}} use, absorbing {{about a quarter of}} production), particularly in the cooling of superconducting magnets, with the main commercial application being in MRI scanners. Helium's other industrial uses—as a pressurizing and purge gas, as a protective atmosphere for arc welding and in processes such as growing crystals to make silicon wafers—account for half of the gas produced. A well-known but <b>minor</b> <b>use</b> is as a lifting gas in balloons and airships. As with any gas whose density differs from that of air, inhaling a small volume of helium temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice. In scientific research, the behavior of the two fluid phases of helium-4 (heliumI and heliumII) is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics (in particular the property of superfluidity) and to those looking at the phenomena, such as superconductivity, produced in matter near absolute zero.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "law" [...] of {{diminishing}} marginal utility {{is said to}} explain the [...] "paradox of water and diamonds", most commonly associated with Adam Smith (though recognized by earlier thinkers). [...] Human beings cannot even survive without water, whereas diamonds, in Smith's day, were ornamentation or engraving bits. Yet water had a very small price, and diamonds a very large price. Marginalists explained {{that it is the}} marginal usefulness of any given quantity that matters, rather than the usefulness of a class or of a totality. [...] For most people, water was sufficiently abundant that the loss or gain of a gallon would withdraw or add only some very <b>minor</b> <b>use</b> if any, whereas diamonds were in much more restricted supply, so that the loss or gain was much greater.|$|E
2500|$|Beltrami {{returned}} for Scream 2 (1998), leading the score though {{there would be}} a late inclusion by Danny Elfman {{in the form of the}} choral track [...] "Cassandra Aria". In addition, excerpts from the score of Broken Arrow by Hans Zimmer appeared in the film, in particular guitar work by Duane Eddy, for the character 'Dewey', replacing many of the character's related tracks from the original Scream score. Beltrami later explained that the Zimmer piece was used as a scratch track for test screening purposes before the score was finalized. The test audience reaction to it influenced the studio keep the Zimmer piece, reducing [...] "Dewey's Theme", which Beltrami had composed to fill its place, to <b>minor</b> <b>use</b> during more serious scenes involving the character. The Zimmer piece would continue to be used in Scream 3 during scenes concerning the evolving relationship between the characters of Dewey and Gale with Beltrami appropriating and adding his own influence to the piece to blend it into the thematic Scream 3 score.|$|E
2500|$|For the {{preservation}} of anthropological and biological specimens during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, objects were dipped in or were painted with a [...] "mercuric solution". This was done to prevent the specimens' destruction by moths, mites and mold. Objects in drawers were protected by scattering crystalline mercuric chloride over them. [...] It finds <b>minor</b> <b>use</b> in tanning, and wood was preserved by kyanizing (soaking in mercuric chloride). [...] Mercuric chloride {{was one of the}} three chemicals used for railroad tie wood treatment between 1830 and 1856 in Europe and the United States. [...] Limited railroad ties were treated in the United States until there were concerns over lumber shortages in the 1890s. [...] The process was generally abandoned because mercuric chloride was water-soluble and not effective for the long term, as well as poisonous. [...] Furthermore, alternative treatment processes, such as copper sulfate, zinc chloride, and ultimately creosote; were found to be less toxic. [...] Limited kyanizing was used for some railroad ties in the 1890s and early 1900s.|$|E
