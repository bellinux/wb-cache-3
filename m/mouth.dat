5|$|Young orangutans also beg {{for food}} by such contact and {{accordingly}} their caretakers regurgitate to feed them. Indeed, behaviours of <b>mouth</b> to <b>mouth</b> feeding of premasticated food and ritualized <b>mouth</b> to <b>mouth</b> contact for bonding {{has been observed}} in anthropoid great apes such as gorillas, orangutans, and chimpanzees. All of this supports the idea that human behaviours of kissing and feeding of premastication foods, {{either directly or indirectly}} from the <b>mouth,</b> have their behavioural roots in higher animals and ancestral great apes.|$|E

In response, the <b>mouth</b> was constructed during the following off-season.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} is {{a common}} condition characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious <b>mouth</b> ulcers (aphthae) in otherwise healthy individuals. The informal term canker sores is also used, mainly in North America, although this may also refer to any <b>mouth</b> ulcer.|$|E

50|$|Pliny names five <b>mouths</b> of the Ganges river, {{and states}} that the Gangaridai {{occupied}} the entire region about these <b>mouths.</b> He names five <b>mouths</b> of Ganges as Kambyson, Mega, Kamberikon, Pseudostomon and Antebole. These exact present-day locations of these <b>mouths</b> cannot be determined with certainty because of the changing courses. According to D. C. Sircar, the region encompassing these <b>mouths</b> {{appears to be the}} region lying between the Bhāgirathi-Hooghly River in the west and the Padma River in the east. This suggests that the Gangaridai territory included the coastal region of present-day West Bangal and Bangladesh, up to the Padma river in the east. Gaurishankar De and Subhradip De believe that the five <b>mouths</b> may refer to the Bidyadhari, Jamuna and other branches of Bhāgirathi-Hooghly at the entrance of Bay of Bengal.|$|R

5|$|At river mile 5.1, the pH of {{the waters}} of Scotch Run is 6.6 and at river mile 1.3, the pH is 7.0. At the stream's <b>mouth,</b> the pH is 6.8.

It is 18 milligrams per liter at the stream's <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century the area around the <b>mouth</b> of the River Somme was {{considered}} a paradise for hunters interested in wildfowl. Because of quarantine restrictions in the United Kingdom, British shooters would board their dogs in the Picardy area, near the <b>mouth</b> of the Somme. This caused the infusion of English Setter blood into the local Spaniel population and developed the Blue Picardy Spaniel.|$|E

5|$|Balaenopterids are the rorquals. These animals, {{along with}} the cetotheriids, rely on their throat pleats to gulp large amounts of water while feeding. The throat pleats extend from the <b>mouth</b> to the navel and allow the <b>mouth</b> to expand to a large volume for more {{efficient}} capture of the small animals they feed on. Balaenopterids consist of two genera and eight species.|$|E

5|$|Digestion {{can take}} a long time. The food moves from the <b>mouth</b> to a J-shaped stomach, where it is stored and initial {{digestion}} occurs. Unwanted items may never get past the stomach, and instead the shark either vomits or turns its stomachs inside out and ejects unwanted items from its <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{teeth of}} plankton-feeders, {{such as the}} basking shark and whale shark, are greatly reduced and non-functional.1 These sharks filter feed on prey by opening their <b>mouths</b> to let tiny organisms get sucked into their <b>mouths</b> to feed without using their teeth at all.|$|R

5|$|Distinguishing {{features}} of the teleosts are mobile premaxilla, elongated neural arches {{at the end of}} the caudal fin and unpaired basibranchial toothplates. The premaxilla is unattached to the neurocranium (braincase); it plays a role in protruding the <b>mouth</b> and creating a circular opening. This lowers the pressure inside the <b>mouth,</b> sucking the prey inside. The lower jaw and maxilla are then pulled back to close the <b>mouth,</b> and the fish is able to grasp the prey. By contrast, mere closure of the jaws would risk pushing food out of the <b>mouth.</b> In more advanced teleosts, the premaxilla is enlarged and has teeth, while the maxilla is toothless. The maxilla functions to push both the premaxilla and the lower jaw forward. To open the <b>mouth,</b> an adductor muscle pulls back the top of the maxilla, pushing the lower jaw forward. In addition, the maxilla rotates slightly, which pushes forward a bony process that interlocks with the premaxilla.|$|E

On the southern coast, Waterford Harbour is situated at the <b>mouth</b> of the River Suir (into which the other two of the Three Sisters (River Nore and River Barrow) flow). The next major inlet is Cork Harbour, at the <b>mouth</b> of the River Lee, in which Great Island is situated.|$|E
5|$|Electromagnetic articulography (EMA) is {{a method}} of {{measuring}} the position of parts of the <b>mouth.</b> EMA uses sensor coils placed on the tongue {{and other parts of}} the <b>mouth</b> to measure their position and movement over time during speech and swallowing. Induction coils around the head produce an electromagnetic field that creates, or induces, a current in the sensors in the <b>mouth.</b> Because the current induced is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance, a computer is able to analyse the current produced and determine the sensor coil's location in space.|$|E

5|$|European nightjars hunt by sight, silhouetting {{their prey}} against the night sky. They tend to flycatch from a perch on moonlit nights, but fly {{continuously}} on darker nights when prey {{is harder to}} see. Hunting frequency reduces {{in the middle of}} the night. Although they have very small bills, the <b>mouth</b> can be opened very wide as they catch insects. They have long sensitive bristles around the <b>mouth,</b> which may help to locate or funnel prey into the <b>mouth.</b> Indigestible parts of insects, such as the chitin exoskeleton, are regurgitated as pellets.|$|E

It was 22.0 milligrams per liter at the <b>mouth</b> in October 1999. The sulfate concentration of the creek at the Truesdale Mine Discharge was 690 milligrams per liter in June 1999 and 720 in October 1999.

5|$|In some instances, {{recurrent}} <b>mouth</b> ulcers may be {{a manifestation}} of an allergic reaction. Possible allergens include certain foods (e.g., chocolate, coffee, strawberries, eggs, nuts, tomatoes, cheese, citrus fruits, benzoates, cinnamaldehyde, and highly acidic foods), toothpastes, and mouthwashes. Where dietary allergens are responsible, <b>mouth</b> ulcers usually develop within about 12–24 hours of exposure.|$|E
