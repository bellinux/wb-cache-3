Think about it: If you lived on a block with $300,000 houses and you sold yours for $2.5 million, your neighbors would thank you. But in my business they don't. That used to make <b>me</b> <b>angry.</b> Now I'm just amused." ...|$|E
500|$|Catriona Wightman of Digital Spy wrote, [...] "This was a {{confusing}} episode of Glee. For a while, it seemed pretty unremarkable—a standard installment, meandering along enjoyably enough. But then, {{in the last}} few minutes, it suddenly got really rather dark indeed. I'm intrigued about what happens next." [...] The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff gave [...] "Mash Off" [...] a [...] "C" [...] grade, and felt that the episode did not reach its full potential. He wrote, [...] "The gut-punch moment is sufficiently gut-punchy, and we'll {{get to that in a}} bit. But everything building up to it is so messy that the solidly dramatic moment almost made <b>me</b> <b>angry.</b> There's something about this show that leads to messy tonal mash-ups. But where the show's musical mash-ups are usually pretty harmonious, the tonal shifts can often be brutally unsubtle." [...] James Poniewozik of Time felt that it was notably inferior to the previous episode, with many more [...] "forgettable scenes and stories".|$|E
2500|$|In {{an episode}} of the Sundance Channel's Iconoclast, R.E.M.'s lead singer Michael Stipe said, [...] "I love that song. I wish I'd written it, and they know I wish I'd written it. It makes me dance; it makes <b>me</b> <b>angry</b> that I didn't write it." ...|$|E

For some remoter reason. That is a thing that only makes <b>me</b> <b>angrier.</b> Why cannot an act rest on its own merits?... As it does in the Angelic Land." ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{contrary}} {{with what}} Sunni says, in Shia literature, {{there are some}} speeches from Ali that deny any problem with his spouse.

2500|$|In 1977, two Hulk {{television}} {{films were}} aired to strong ratings, {{leading to an}} Incredible Hulk TV series which aired from 1978 to 1982. A huge ratings success, the series introduced the popular Hulk catchphrase, [...] "Don't make <b>me</b> <b>angry.</b> You wouldn't like me when I'm angry", and broadened the character's popularity from a niche comic book readership into the mainstream consciousness.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Reichs was {{an expert}} witness in the Casey Anthony murder trial. After {{initially}} refusing {{to be a part}} of Anthony's defense, she cited biased media coverage as the reason she changed her mind. [...] “Initially, I said no, and then I started seeing media coverage and it made <b>me</b> <b>angry.</b> This woman needed to be tried in court, not in the press.” Reichs did a full skeletal analysis of Anthony's daughter, Caylee, but could not determine a cause of death. [...] She concluded that there was no evidence of abuse and that the child appeared to be well-nourished.|$|E

2500|$|Mixed Martial Arts Champion Andrei Arlovski: [...] "The {{pit bull}} {{has a long}} history in America. In the early 1900s the U.S. proudly used pit bulls on WWI posters to symbolize qualities that make up America - friendly, courageous, hard working and worthy of respect. I chose my name because I admire the breed for the same reasons. When I hear about pit bulls being used in dog {{fighting}}, it makes <b>me</b> <b>angry.</b> I have a choice to step into the cage to fight, but these dogs have no choice. Dog fighting is morally wrong and inhumane. In my opinion it's torture. Please join me in Knocking Out Dog Fighting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not {{unlike the}} earlier {{exchange}} with Henrietta, the conversation between Leopold and Mme Fisher is uncomfortable {{and at times}} Mme Fisher is blunt, even cruel. She attempts to explain Karen's unique nature to the disconsolate boy, abandoning any of those delicacies requested in Marian Grant Moody's earlier letter. She explains Leopold his history, including {{the details of his}} birth, the death of his half-sibling, his adoption, and his general displacement in the world. Leopold begs to remain in the house, exclaiming, [...] "At Spezia when I am angry I go full of smoke inside, but when you make <b>me</b> <b>angry</b> I see everything." [...] At this point Miss Fisher returns to the room and whisks Leopold away again.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2006, escort and masseur Mike Jones {{alleged that}} Haggard had paid him {{to engage in}} sex with him {{for three years and}} had also {{purchased}} and used crystal methamphetamine. Jones said he had only recently learned of Haggard's true identity, and explained his reasons for coming forward by saying, [...] "It made <b>me</b> <b>angry</b> that here's someone preaching against gay marriage and going behind the scenes having gay sex." [...] Jones made the allegations public in response to Haggard's political support for a Colorado Amendment 43 on the November 7, 2006, Colorado ballot that would ban same-sex marriage in that state. Jones told ABC News, [...] "I had to expose the hypocrisy. He is in the position of influence of millions of followers, and he's preaching against gay marriage. But behind everybody's back [...] doing what he's preached against." [...] Jones hoped that his statements would sway voters.|$|E

2500|$|Lady Zhen bore Cao Pi {{a son and}} a daughter. Their son, Cao Rui, {{later became}} the second emperor of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period. Their daughter, whose {{personal}} name was not recorded in history, was referred to as [...] "Princess Dongxiang" [...] (東鄉公主; literally [...] "Princess of the East District") in historical records. Lady Zhen remained humble even though Cao Pi deeply fancied her. She provided encouragement to Cao Pi's other wives who were also adored by him, and comforted those whom he less favoured. She also often urged Cao Pi to take more concubines so that he would have more descendants, citing the example of the mythical Yellow Emperor. Cao Pi was very pleased. Once, Cao Pi wanted to send Lady Ren (任氏), one of his concubines who fell out favour with him, back to her family – which meant that he was divorcing her. When Lady Zhen heard about it, she told her husband, [...] "Lady Ren comes from a reputable clan. I can't match her in terms of moral character and looks. Why do you want to send her away?" [...] Cao Pi replied, [...] "She is unruly, impulsive and disobedient. She has made <b>me</b> <b>angry</b> many times before. I'm sending her away." [...] Lady Zhen wept and pleaded with her husband, [...] "Everyone knows that you love and adore me, and they'll think that you're sending Lady Ren away because of me. I fear that I'll be ridiculed and accused of abusing your favour towards me. Please consider your decision again carefully." [...] Cao Pi ignored her and sent Lady Ren away.|$|E
