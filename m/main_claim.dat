25|$|The new {{restaurant}} was immediately popular. Washington Post food critic Phyllis Richman declared the restaurant's signature hamburger its best entree. She found the appetizers and salads excellent, but considered the pasta dishes hit-or-miss and disparaged the main entrees. Within a year, {{the restaurant was}} mostly being patronized by yuppies, lawyers, and tourists. 1986 food reviews in the Washington Post concluded that Old Ebbitt Grill had the worst omelets and pancakes in the city, but the best appetizers. Its <b>main</b> <b>claim</b> to fame was its hefty portions and moderate prices.|$|E
25|$|The town's <b>main</b> <b>claim</b> to fame is that {{it played}} a {{significant}} part in the World War II Normandy landings because this village stood {{right in the middle}} of route N13, which the Germans would have most likely used on any significant counterattack on the troops landing on Utah and Omaha Beaches. In the early morning of 6 June 1944 mixed units of the U.S. 82nd Airborne and U.S. 101st Airborne Divisions occupied the town in Mission Boston, giving it the claim to be one of the first towns liberated in the invasion.|$|E

Her <b>main</b> <b>claim</b> to fame, however, {{is that she was}} the first command of future Rear-Admiral Charles Austen, who was also the brother of the famed novelist Jane Austen. Still, after the Navy sold her she became a whaler for Samuel Enderby & Sons.

Founded as an electrical novelties company, Lionel specialized in various products throughout its existence, but toy trains and model railroads were its <b>main</b> <b>claim</b> to fame. Lionel trains, produced from 1900 to 1969, drew admiration from model railroaders {{around the world for}} the solidity of their construction and the authenticity of their detail. During its peak years in the 1950s, the company sold $25 million worth of trains per year. In 2006, Lionel's electric train, along with the Easy-Bake Oven, became the first electric toy inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame.|$|E

In the same year, Henry Salt put Champollion's decipherment to the test, successfully using it to read further inscriptions, he published a corroboration of Champollion's system, in which he also criticized Champollion for not acknowledging his dependence on Young's work.|$|E

The German works of Kurt Weill were amongst Klemperer's favorites and he encouraged Weill to compose the orchestral suite Kleine Dreigroschenmusik.|$|E
2500|$|Llyn Cerrig Bach is a {{small lake}} in the north-west of the island of Anglesey, Wales. Its <b>main</b> <b>claim</b> to fame is the group of over 150 Iron Age metal objects {{discovered}} there in 1942, apparently placed in the lake as votive offerings. These finds {{are considered to be}} one of the most important collections of La Tène style metalwork discovered in the British Isles, and the most important in Wales. [...] A recent re-assessment of the objects now sees them as a collection of different offerings deposited over a long period from about 300 BC to 100 AD, rather than a single group deposited together, as was previously thought. [...] Most of the items found at Llyn Cerrig Bach can usually be seen in the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff, which holds all but four of the objects discovered, although until November 2012 most have been loaned to the Oriel Ynys Môn museum in Anglesey.|$|E
2500|$|Norwood is a lyric contralto, {{with a range}} {{spanning}} three octaves {{and five}} semitones. Her voice has often been described as soft, raspy, and husky by music critics and Norwood herself. Music critic and Slant Magazine writer Andrew Chan describes Norwood's vocal tone as having [...] "an unusual mix of warmth and cold, hard edges". He further describes her vocal quality, saying, [...] "Like little else in pop-music singing, Brandy's subtle manipulation of timbre and texture rewards close listening. [...] Her <b>main</b> <b>claim</b> of technical virtuosity has always been her long, cascading riffs, a skill many R die-hards revere her for." [...] Norwood is also noted for her use of multitrack recording to create intricate vocal arrangements and layering. Terry Sawyer of PopMatters writes on this skill, remarking, [...] "While it's been said that Brandy's voice isn't exactly a barn burner, it's not mentioned enough that she does more than enough with what she's got. She never leaves her voice hanging in spotlit scarcity, folding its variegated terracing, whispering out the lead track, shouting in the back-up, and piling each song with enough interlocking sounds to create the tightly packed illusion of vocal massiveness." ...|$|E
