40|$|Background. Reverse flow sural neurocutaneous flap {{has been}} {{utilized}} more frequently {{during the past}} decade to cover vital structures around the foot and ankle area. The potential advantages are the relatively constant blood supply, ease of elevation and preservation of major vascular trunks in the leg. The potential disadvantages remain venous congestion, donor site morbidity and lack of sensation. Methods. This descriptive case series was conducted at Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, from 1997 to 2003. Ten patients having undergone reverse flow sural neurocutaneous flap were identified through medical records. There were six females (60 %) and four males (40 %), with an average age of 59. 8 years. The defects occurred as a result of trauma in five patients (50 %), diabetic ulcers in four (40 %) and decubitus ulcer in one (10 %) paraplegic patient. The defect site included non weight bearing heel in four (40 %), tendo Achilles in two (20 %), distal tibia in two (20 %), lateral malleolus in one (10 %) and medial aspect of the midfoot in one patient (10 %). The maximum flap size harvested was 14 × 6 cm. Preoperative doppler evaluation was performed in all patients to identify perforators and <b>modified</b> <b>plaster</b> of paris boot was used in the post operative period. A detailed questionnaire was developed addressing variables of interest. Results. There was no flap failure. Venous congestion was encountered in one case. The donor site was relatively unsightly but acceptable to all patients. The loss of sensation in the sural nerve distribution was transient in all patients. Conclusion. Reverse sural artery flap remains to be the workhorse flap to resurface the soft tissue defects of the foot and ankle. Anastomosis of the sural nerve to the digital plantar nerve can potentially solve the issue of lack of sensation in the flap especially when used for weight bearing heel. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{integration}} of phase change materials (PCMs) into building structures. The basic requirement is improved thermal stability during the summer season without using an air conditioner. This {{can be achieved by}} increasing the thermal storage capacity of the building structures. If the thermal capacity cannot be increased on the level of weight, phase change materials can be used. These materials are capable of storing latent heat and thus increasing the thermal storage capacity of the building. In the thesis the phase change materials were investigated in a thermal incubator by thermal analysis and, above all, in full-scale experiments using comparative measurements. The comparative measurements were carried out in two attic rooms at the Faculty of Civil Engineering, Brno University of Technology, where in one was used as a reference and the other for the experiment. Manufactured heat storage panels were installed in the experimental room. These panels are composed of a base plate; the capillary tubes placed on it are coated with <b>modified</b> <b>plaster.</b> The gypsum plaster is modified with micro-capsules paraffin for improving the thermal storage capacity. This system is connected to a thermal air-water pump, by which the storage panels can be additionally cooled or heated. In the experimental measurements, different operating modes were investigated and their effect on the indoor environment was evaluated. Thermal storage in PCMs dampens the temperature amplitude in the building during the summer season and, at the same time, allows the stored heat to be discharged during the night. Moreover, the time interval of withdrawing electric energy from the supply mains is much shorter than in the case of air conditioning. A conventional air conditioner must operate simultaneously with the thermal load, i. e. at the time of peak consumption of electric energy. Thanks to the set regimes, the installed system is capable of responding to external thermal condi...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The article {{deals with}} the {{assessment}} of three brick powders. Their properties are evaluated {{on the basis of}} their pozzolanic activity, specific surface area and amorphous area. The brick powders were used in amounts of 20 and 40 % as a substitute for binder in lime mortars. The influence of the powders on the properties of the <b>modified</b> <b>plasters</b> in a hardened state was evaluated via the determination of strength characteristics. It was found that not all brick powders are suitable for use in modified lime mortars...|$|R

The characterization of {{its effect on the}} properties of <b>modified</b> <b>plasters</b> is performed using the measurement of a wide set of parameters including bulk density, matrix density, open porosity, compressive strength, bending strength, water absorption coefficient, water vapour diffusion resistance factor, thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity.

40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to {{investigations}} on influence of laser treatment regimes of gas-thermal and adhesive coatings from self-fluxing powders on iron basis and after melting with <b>modifying</b> <b>plaster</b> on their roughness and phase composition. One of mathematical planning methods that is a complete factor experiment method {{has been used for}} investigation of parameters’ influence on micro-geometry of coatings. The executed investigations have made it possible to observe a general regularity which does not depend on a type of alloying plaster: while increasing speed of laser beam relatively to treated part, beam diameter value of  Ra  parameter is becoming less. Decrease in height of surface irregularities in case of increasing laser beam speed is related with intensification of evaporation processes. An increase in beam diameter diminishes  Ra  parameter of the surface. This {{is due to the fact}} that decrease in power density occurs at high rate of beam defocusing. Overlapping coefficient does not exert a pronounced effect on  Ra  parameter of fused coatings. While increasing the speed of laser beam relatively to the part structure is transferred from dendrite into supersaturated one with carbide and boride precipitations. It has been established that technological parameters of laser treatment and particularly speed of laser beam influence on coating composition. While increasing the speed up to  v 5  = 5  ×  10 – 3  m/s amount of chromium has become larger by 1. 5 -fold that resulted in increase of micro-hardness of the coating from 9. 5 – 10. 1 GPa up to 11. 04 – 15. 50 GPa. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{prosthetist}} makes {{a conventional}} socket by wrapping plaster bandage around {{the residual limb}} and using the resulting shell to create a positive model. After he or she <b>modifies</b> the <b>plaster,</b> {{it is used to}} create a laminated socket. Such sockets are almost perfect cylinders that encapsulate the limb. The bone is centered in soft, compressible tissue that must move aside before the bone can push against the socket to transmit force or torque to the prosthesis. In a compression/release stabilized (CRS) socket, three or more longitudinal depressions compress and displace tissue between the socket wall and the bone to reduce lost motion when the bone is moved with respect to the socket. Release areas between depressions are opened to accommodate displaced tissue. Without these openings provided, the CRS socket will not function as intended. Often, the release areas of compression are the struts of a carbon-fiber frame, and the regions between struts are left open. A frame with openings may be modified by the prosthetist adding a thin membrane fully surrounding the limb but allowing the membrane and underlying tissue to enter the release openings. The membrane may contain electrodes, and it may constitute a roll-on liner that helps suspend the prosthesis. We introduce three socket designs: transradial, transfemoral, and transhumeral...|$|R
