2500|$|Original master discs {{are created}} by lathe-cutting: a lathe is used to cut a {{modulated}} groove into a blank record. The blank records for cutting used to be cooked up, as needed, by the cutting engineer, using what Robert K. Morrison describes as a [...] "metallic soap", containing lead litharge, ozokerite, barium sulfate, montan wax, stearin and paraffin, among other ingredients. Cut [...] "wax" [...] sound discs would {{be placed in a}} vacuum chamber and gold-sputtered to make them electrically conductive for use as <b>mandrels</b> in an electroforming bath, where pressing stamper parts were made. Later, the French company Pyral invented a ready-made blank disc having a thin nitro-cellulose lacquer coating (approximately 7 mils thickness on both sides) that was applied to an aluminum substrate. Lacquer cuts result in an immediately playable, or processable, master record. If vinyl pressings are wanted, the still-unplayed sound disc is used as a mandrel for electroforming nickel records that are used for manufacturing pressing stampers. The electroformed nickel records are mechanically separated from their respective <b>mandrels.</b> This is done with relative ease because no actual [...] "plating" [...] of the mandrel occurs in the type of electrodeposition known as electroforming, unlike with electroplating, in which the adhesion of the new phase of metal is chemical and relatively permanent. The one-molecule-thick coating of silver (that was sprayed onto the processed lacquer sound disc in order to make its surface electrically conductive) reverse-plates onto the nickel record's face. This negative impression disc (having ridges in place of grooves) is known as a nickel master, [...] "matrix" [...] or [...] "father". The [...] "father" [...] is then used as a mandrel to electroform a positive disc known as a [...] "mother". Many mothers can be grown on a single [...] "father" [...] before ridges deteriorate beyond effective use. The [...] "mothers" [...] are then used as <b>mandrels</b> for electroforming more negative discs known as [...] "sons". Each [...] "mother" [...] {{can be used to make}} many [...] "sons" [...] before deteriorating. The [...] "sons" [...] are then converted into [...] "stampers" [...] by center-punching a spindle hole (which was lost from the lacquer sound disc during initial electroforming of the [...] "father"), and by custom-forming the target pressing profile. This allows them to be placed in the dies of the target (make and model) record press and, by center-roughing, to facilitate the adhesion of the label, which gets stuck onto the vinyl pressing without any glue. In this way, several million vinyl discs can be produced from a single lacquer sound disc. When only a few hundred discs are required, instead of electroforming a [...] "son" [...] (for each side), the [...] "father" [...] is removed of its silver and converted into a stamper. Production by this latter method, known as the [...] "two-step process" [...] (as it does not entail creation of [...] "sons" [...] but does involve creation of [...] "mothers", which are used for test playing and kept as [...] "safeties" [...] for electroforming future [...] "sons") is limited to a few hundred vinyl pressings. The pressing count can increase if the stamper holds out and the quality of the vinyl is high. The [...] "sons" [...] made during a [...] "three-step" [...] electroforming make better stampers since they don't require silver removal (which reduces some high fidelity because of etching erasing part of the smallest groove modulations) and also because they have a stronger metal structure than [...] "fathers".|$|E

5000|$|The Xpandrel {{method of}} {{expanding}} <b>mandrels</b> {{was introduced in}} the mid-1990s. This method uses basic mechanical principles of deformation to achieve expansion of a non-tapered mandrel. Using various methods of actuation, the body of the mandrel is deformed below the limit of elasticity to provide repeatable holding forces without typical deformation caused by pressing on tapered <b>mandrels.</b> Other commercial <b>mandrels</b> are very slightly tapered, and the hollow object slides down the taper until it [...] "sticks". The shop-made mandrel shown in the photo is designed to clamp a hollow tube or gear between the two tapered plugs. There is little about such a mandrel that can't be made right on the lathe on which it is to be used, so {{it is not uncommon for}} machinists to make a mandrel to hold a particular item and then set the mandrel aside hoping to use it again some day. <b>Mandrels</b> of this type are usually set in the lathe on centers and turned with a lathe dog.|$|E

40|$|The tube {{numerical}} control (NC) bending {{process is a}} much complex physical process with multifactors coupling interactive effects. The <b>mandrel</b> {{is the key to}} improve forming quality and to enhance forming limit. In this study, based on the platform of ABAQUS/Explicit, a 3 D elastic-plastic finite element model of NC bending process of 2169 (0 Cr 21 Ni 6 Mn 9 N) stainless steel tube was established, key technological problems were solved, and its reliability was validated. Then, simulation and analysis of the processes were carried out, and the influence laws of <b>mandrel</b> types and <b>mandrel</b> parameters on cross-section quality were obtained. The results show that the wall thinning or cross section deformation is serious at the middle part and small {{in the vicinity of the}} bending plane or initial bending plane; the wall thinning degree increases or the cross section deformation degree decreases with the increase of <b>mandrel</b> diameter or <b>mandrel</b> extension length; the effect of bulb <b>mandrel</b> on the cross section quality is more significant than that of cylinder <b>mandrel.</b> And the reasonable <b>mandrel</b> types and <b>mandrel</b> parameters are chosen for the 2169 high-pressure hydraulic tube with small diameter.

2500|$|There {{are several}} methods for forming {{internal}} cavities in extrusions.
