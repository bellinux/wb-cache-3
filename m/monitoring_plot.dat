Throughfall collectors were placed every 25 m on a transect of 1. 4 km, oriented according to the dominant wind direction. The throughfall water was analysed on NH 4 +. A permanent <b>monitoring</b> <b>plot</b> is situated {{in the middle of}} the transect where quantity and chemical composition of different water fractions are monitored fortnightly. Along the transect, soil samples of the upper mineral soil (0 - 10 cm) were taken and analysed on pH-H 2 O and pH-KCl. The measured deposition of NH 4 +-N was very high, especially in the forest edge at the prevailing wind direction (55 kg ha(- 1) year(- 1)), where up to twice as much NH 4 +-N was found as in the <b>monitoring</b> <b>plot.</b> A forest edge zone of 180 m with significantly higher NH 4 + deposition could clearly be delineated.

30|$|These stand {{structure}} changes are {{also consistent with}} earlier results reported with smaller subsets of the giant sequoia-mixed conifer forest <b>monitoring</b> <b>plot</b> data that showed most of the 40 – 50 percent density reduction resulting from prescribed fire generally occurred in trees less than 40 cm in diameter (Keifer 1998, Keifer et al. 2000). Twenty years after a second prescribed fire treatment, in three giant sequoia-mixed conifer plots, woody fuels, as well as litter and duff, were somewhat less than that in unburned areas.

40|$|Global {{environmental}} changes may be altering {{the ecology of}} tropical forests. Long-term <b>monitoring</b> <b>plots</b> have provided much of the evidence for largescale, directional changes in tropical forests, but {{the results have been}} controversial. Here we review evidence from six complementary approaches to understanding possible changes: plant physiology experiments, long-term <b>monitoring</b> <b>plots,</b> ecosystem flux techniques, atmospheric measurements, Earth observations, and global-scale vegetation models. Evidence from four of these approaches suggests that large-scale, directional changes are occurring in the ecology of tropical forests, with the other two approaches providing inconclusive results. Collectively, the evidence indicates that both gross and net primary productivity has likely increased over recent decades, as have tree growth, recruitment, and mortality rates, and forest biomass. These results suggest a profound reorganization of tropical forest ecosystems.

30|$|If {{the fuel}} loads in the 1971 pre-fire {{research}} plots are anomalously low {{due to a}} different sampling method (fine fuels) or transect length used (woody fuels), then the 31 -year post-fire fuel loads may not have actually increased over pre-fire levels, but are rather, an artifact of the sampling method. In any case, when all fuels are included, the 31 -year post-fire fuel loads are similar to, or slightly less than, those in untreated areas. These results could indicate that decomposition may be approaching fuel accumulation rates after about 30 years without treatment, {{consistent with the findings}} of Kittredge (1955). Although total fuel load increased somewhat in the unburned ponderosa pine <b>monitoring</b> <b>plots</b> after 50 – 90 years without fire, basal area was much higher (59.9 m 2 ha− 1) than that for the research <b>plots</b> or burned <b>monitoring</b> <b>plots.</b> A difference in basal area may account for the variation in fuel accumulation patterns among the different ponderosa pine forest sampling sites.

Also for the European Level I sites deposition estimates were computed. Not only the deposition of sulphur and nitrogen compounds was determined, but also the deposition of base cations was calculated. For this an approach was used, mainly based on available measurement data from the Intensive Monitoring sites. This derived model was also used to extrapolate to the Level I sites and Intensive Monitoring sites without deposition measurements. Critical loads according to the effect-based and stand-still approach were calculated, as well as present deposition thresholds for both the Intensive Monitoring sites and the Level I sites. Using the deposition calculations and critical loads/present deposition thresholds, exceedances of these target loads were calculated and presented. The uncertainties involved in these calculations were evaluated and finally conclusions were drawn {{on the basis of the}} results of the different calculations...|$|R

Overall, Lazuli Bunting abundance on the study area increased significantly during the 2 years after a stand-replacing wildfire, which covered 800 ha of Gambel oak woodland. This increase suggested that Lazuli Buntings respond positively to fire. However, a comparison of pre- and post-fire abundance of Lazuli Bunting for 2 groups of <b>monitoring</b> <b>plots</b> with different fire histories showed that abundance was significantly greater during the post-fire period for both burned and unburned plots. When we examined our data at a spatial scale appropriate to Lazuli Bunting, we found that post-fire increases observed on unburned plots were limited to plots {{in close proximity to}} the burned area. A comparison of pre- and post-fire abundance of Lazuli Bunting for 3 groups of <b>monitoring</b> <b>plots</b> located at various distances from the burned area revealed that post-fire abundance was similar only for plots within the fire boundary and for those ≤ 1000 m from the fire boundary; plots located 3 ̆e 1000 m from the fire boundary had fewer individuals per plot post-fire.

40|$|Periurban {{forests are}} key to {{offsetting}} anthropogenic carbon emissions, but they are under constant threat from urbanization. In particular, secondary Neotropical forest types in Andean periurban areas have a high potential to store carbon, but are currently poorly characterized. To address this lack of information, we developed a method to estimate periurban aboveground biomass (AGB) —a proxy for multiple ecosystem services—of secondary Andean forests near Bogotá, Colombia, based on very high resolution (VHR) GeoEye- 1, Pleiades- 1 A imagery and field-measured plot data. Specifically, we tested a series of different pre-processing workflows to derive six vegetation indices that were regressed against in situ estimates of AGB. Overall, the coupling of linear models and the Ratio Vegetation Index produced the most satisfactory results. Atmospheric and topographic correction proved to be key in improving model fit, especially in high aerosol and rugged terrain such as the Andes. Methods and findings provide baseline AGB and carbon stock information for little studied periurban Andean secondary forests.

Many traditional methods for monitoring can be infrequent and limited in scope. Ground-based LiDAR is one remote sensing method that offers a clear advancement to monitor vegetation dynamics at high spatial and temporal resolution. We determined the effectiveness of LiDAR to detect intra-annual variability in vegetation structure at a long-term Sonoran Desert <b>monitoring</b> <b>plot</b> dominated by cacti, deciduous and evergreen shrubs. Monthly repeat LiDAR scans of perennial plant canopies {{over the course of}} one year had high precision. LiDAR measurements of canopy height and area were accurate with respect to total station survey measurements of individual plants. We found {{an increase in the number}} of LiDAR vegetation returns following the wet North American Monsoon season. This intra-annual variability in vegetation structure detected by LiDAR was attributable to a drought deciduous shrub Ambrosia deltoidea, whereas the evergreen shrub Larrea tridentata and cactus Opuntia engelmannii had low variability. Benefits of using LiDAR over traditional methods to census desert plants are more rapid, consistent, and cost-effective data acquisition in a high-resolution, 3 -dimensional context. We conclude that repeat LiDAR measurements can be an effective method for documenting ecosystem response to desert climatology and drought over short time intervals and at detailed-local spatial scale...|$|E

The drought killed over half (63 %) of the sampled trees over the entire elevation gradient. Significant mortality occurred in trees up to 20 cm diameter (P < 0. 05). Pinus cembroides Zucc. experienced the highest seedling and tree mortality (P < 0. 0001) (55 % of piñon pines died), and over five times as many standing dead pines were observed in 2012 than in 2009.

The lack of significant findings following first entry fire may also be due to pseudoreplication of plots, which is inherent in prescribed fire analysis with multiple burn units over multiple years (van Mantgem et al. 1999), or to the overall low burn severity found in the <b>monitoring</b> <b>plots</b> (Figure 1, Table 1).|$|R

Dynamics of pollutant accumulation in soils depends on number of Novocherkassk regional power plant emissions. The content of benzo[a]pyrene in the soil is an indicator of the technogenic load impact on the areas, for which the combustion products of hydrocarbon fuel are the major pollutants.

We examined prefire fuels from host species in a forest <b>monitoring</b> <b>plot</b> network in Big Sur, California (USA), to understand the interactions between disease-caused mortality and wildfire severity during the 2008 Basin Complex wildfire. Detailed measurements of standing dead woody stems and downed woody debris 1 – 2 {{years prior to the}} Basin fire provided a rare picture of the increased fuels attributable to SOD mortality. Despite great differences in host fuel abundance, we found no significant difference in burn severity between infested and uninfested plots. Instead, the relationship between SOD and fire reflected the changing nature of the disease impacts over time. Increased SOD mortality contributed to overstory burn severity only in areas where the pathogen had recently invaded. Where longer-term disease establishment allowed dead material to fall and accumulate, increasing log volumes led to increased substrate burn severity. These patterns help inform forest management decisions regarding fire, both in Big Sur and in other areas of California as the pathogen continues to expand throughout coastal forests...|$|E

In addition, seedling data from 78 temporary vegetation survey plots established in three major forest patches were used to assess the influence of different factors on seedling abundance. At Tiromoana Bush, the most common canopy tree species as seedlings in the permanent vegetation <b>monitoring</b> <b>plots</b> was mahoe followed by fivefinger. Mahoe seedling density was significantly affected by canopy openness, distance to seed sources, light index, shrub cover and slope, but not by aspect, basal area and time. For fivefinger, seedlings increased in abundance with time, but the difference was not statistically significant. The relative growth rate of mahoe in the 20 - 49 cm height class (in which most seedlings occurred) was significantly affected by shrub cover, light index and canopy vii openness. Mahoe seedling recruits were significantly affected by light index and canopy openness. Survivability of mahoe was affected by aspect. For fivefinger, individual relative growth rates were significantly affected by canopy openness and light index. Similar results were found for tree species seedlings present in the temporary survey plots provided with mahoe and fivefinger again the most common species, followed by kohuhu. Light index significantly affected golden akeake small seedlings as well as canopy openness. Light index significantly affected ngaio large seedling distribution. Aspect was the only significant factor for kohuhu large seedling distribution. Distance from seed sources significantly affected fivefinger small seedling distribution as seedlings are dependent upon dispersal away from the parent trees. Slope significantly affected the distribution of red matipou small seedlings. The most important environmental attribute influencing seedling abundance is light. This is evident in both the permanent seedling <b>monitoring</b> <b>plots</b> and the temporary vegetation survey plots. Based on data from the temporary vegetation survey plots, mahoe, fivefinger and kohuhu are most abundant suggesting that these three canopy tree species will dominate the forest canopy at Tiromoana Bush once the kanuka starts to senesce...|$|R
40|$|The species {{diversity}} of ground beetles (Carabidae) was monitored in the plantations of fast growing trees (poplars and willows) in the District of Žďár nad Sázavou, Czech Republic (faunistic square 6463). Relations {{between age and}} type of vegetation and biodiversity were observed. Samples were collected from pitfall traps at monthly intervals from May to October in 2008. In total, 36 species of Carabidae represented by 912 specimens were entrapped in the 4 <b>monitored</b> <b>plots.</b> Basic synecologic characteristics (dominance, {{species diversity}}, evenness and Jaccard similarity index) were evaluated. The most numerous species in the plot No. 1 was Abax parallelepipedus (99 specimens), in the plot No. 2 Limodromus assimilis (112 specimens), in the plot No. 3 Amara montivaga (32 specimens) and in the plot No. 4 Poecilus cupreus (52 specimens). The majority of adaptable species was recorded in the plot No. 1, which signifies a well-regenerated secondary biotope. Shannon’s diversity index (2. 78) were {{the highest in the}} plot No. 3, and the highest evenness was also in the plot No. ​ 3 (0. 84). The highest similarity expressed by the Jaccard similarity index was observed between the plots No. 2 and 4, the lowest between the plots No. 1 and 3. Fast growing trees plantations host similar fauna of ground beetles as the surrounding agroecosystems with eurytopic species dominating. Specific species of cultivated trees do not probably significantly affect the species composition of ground beetles, but the density of vegetation can affect the abundance of species present. Two threatened species of (Brachinus explodens and Cicindela campestris) according to Decree No. 395 / 1992 Coll. were identified in the <b>monitored</b> <b>plots...</b>|$|R
