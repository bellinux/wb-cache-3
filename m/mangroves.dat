5|$|Most of Carabane {{is covered}} in <b>mangroves,</b> forming an impassable jungle {{that can only be}} crossed in {{constructed}} passages. <b>Mangroves</b> are among the few species capable of adapting to the highly saline environment, where the quantity of oxygen in the soil is low. In recent decades there has been concern that the <b>mangroves</b> are less prevalent. There are various reasons for the degradation, including crustaceans and the unregulated exploitation of wood. Efforts have been made to safeguard the <b>mangroves</b> and to educate children about their importance.|$|E
5|$|St Kilda is {{adjacent}} to the mangrove forest bordering Barker Inlet, part of the largest tidal estuary of Gulf St Vincent. Late in the 19th Century embankments were constructed through the <b>mangroves</b> {{in an effort to}} reclaim land for pasturing. With the construction of the banks of the adjacent saltfields maintenance of the embankments ceased and the <b>mangroves</b> began to reclaim them. One of these embankments is used as the beginning of a boardwalk through the <b>mangroves</b> which forms a 1.7km loop through the samphire saltmarsh flats and <b>mangroves</b> reaching the border between the ocean and forest.|$|E
5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela mostly inhabits <b>mangroves</b> in monsoonal coastal areas, especially thickets of spotted mangrove (Rhizophora stylosa), smallflower bruguiera (Bruguiera parviflora) and grey mangrove (Avicennia marina) bordering islands or in river deltas, but {{it often}} also occurs in paperbark thickets fringing the <b>mangroves</b> {{such as those}} of cajeput (Melaleuca leucadendra). It is a mangrove specialist, an adaptation that probably occurred as northern Australia became more arid and the bird populations became dependent on <b>mangroves</b> as other types of forest disappeared. The <b>mangroves</b> provide nectar and insects as well as shelter and nesting sites, and they supply the majority of the species' needs for most of the year. In Australia, mangrove vegetation forms a narrow discontinuous strip along thousands of kilometres of coastline, accommodating birds specialized for the habitat. Eighty Mile Beach in Western Australia has no <b>mangroves</b> and no fringing Melaleuca forests, reducing its potential for successful colonization by nectarivores, and it marks the southern limit of the red-headed myzomela in Western Australia.|$|E

5|$|<b>Mangroves</b> {{also serve}} as {{excellent}} rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the <b>mangroves</b> as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources and the protection offered from most prey. Thousands of birds can nest in the <b>mangroves</b> at once, making a noisy and messy colony, but their droppings fertilize the mangrove trees. Shorebirds like rails, terns and gulls; diving birds such as pelicans and grebes; and birds of prey such as ospreys, hawks and vultures are {{among the more than}} 100 species of birds that use Everglades mangrove trees to raise their young.|$|E
5|$|Three {{species of}} {{mangrove}} trees {{exist in the}} region: red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa), although all are from different families.

Black and white <b>mangroves</b> excrete salt from under their leaves, and red <b>mangroves</b> filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red <b>mangroves,</b> for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems.

5|$|The brown honeyeater is {{seasonally}} nomadic {{across its}} local area {{in response to}} flowering food plants. For example, there are marked increases in numbers in Toowoomba in south-east Queensland during winter, and in the Northern Territory the range contracts during the dry season. It is commonly found among <b>mangroves</b> in coastal areas including black <b>mangroves</b> (Rhizophora mucronata). It is often in woodlands that merge into the <b>mangroves,</b> such as those dominated by Banksia, Melaleuca or Callistemon, and widespread in sclerophyll forests and eucalypt woodlands. In the arid and semi-arid inland of Australia it is most often recorded in Acacia, Grevillea and Hakea shrubland along watercourses, and at bores, springs and drainage lines. It visits flowering shrubs in parks and gardens, and occurs in remnant patches of trees on travelling stock routes.|$|E

5|$|Within the Florida {{mangrove}} systems live 220species of fish, and {{a variety}} of crabs, crayfish, shrimp, mollusks, and other invertebrates, which serve as the main source of food for many birds. Dozens of bird species use <b>mangroves</b> as nurseries and food stores, including pelicans, grebes, tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor), gulls, terns, hawks and kites, and arboreal birds like mangrove cuckoos (Coccyzus minor), yellow warblers (Dendroica petechia), and white-crowned pigeons (Patagioenas leucocephala). The <b>mangroves</b> also support 24species of amphibians and reptiles, and 18species of mammals, including the endangered green turtle (Chelonia mydas), hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), and West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus).|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{occupy a}} wide range of {{habitats}} from forests in subalpine regions to <b>mangroves.</b> However, no species is found in all types of habitat. The most widespread species, such as the galah and cockatiel, are open-country specialists that feed on grass seeds. They are often highly mobile fast flyers and are nomadic. Flocks of birds move across large areas of the inland, locating and feeding on seed and other food sources. Drought may force flocks from more arid areas to move further into farming areas. Other cockatoo species, such as the glossy black cockatoo, inhabit woodlands, rainforests, shrublands and even alpine forests. The red-vented cockatoo inhabits <b>mangroves</b> and its absence from northern Luzon {{may be related to the}} lack of mangrove forests there. Forest-dwelling cockatoos are generally sedentary, as the food supply is more stable and predictable. Several species have adapted well to human modified habitats and are found in agricultural areas and even busy cities.|$|E
30|$|Dissolved {{organic matter}} (DOM) {{is a primary}} food source for sponge-bacterial consortia (de Goeij et al. 2008 a, b), {{and it has been}} {{hypothesized}} that DOM leaching from <b>mangrove</b> roots {{plays an important role in}} structuring <b>mangrove</b> sponge community composition (Hunting et al. 2010 b). <b>Mangrove</b> DOM consists mainly of tannins and polyphenolic compounds (Maie and Jaffe 2006), which are structurally complex and recalcitrant to biodegradation (Field and Lettinga 1992; Koch et al. 2005; Kristensen et al. 2008), thereby reducing <b>mangrove</b> palatability and inhibiting growth of fouling organisms on <b>mangrove</b> roots (e.g., Schmitt et al. 1998). A limited number of bacterial and fungal species are able to degrade complex polyphenols and tannins (Bhat et al. 1998). Therefore, the ability of mangrove-associated sponge-bacterial consortia to degrade <b>mangrove</b> DOM may explain the persistence of <b>mangrove</b> species in <b>mangrove</b> ecosystems, while the inability to degrade <b>mangrove</b> DOM could potentially hamper fouling of roots by reef species. However, this remains to be proven experimentally. This study therefore aimed to test whether <b>mangrove</b> DOM leachates from roots are responsible for the observed deterioration of reef species transplanted to <b>mangrove</b> roots. To this end, we (1) transplanted a typical reef species and a typical <b>mangrove</b> species to mimicry substrates containing <b>mangrove</b> root extract and to control substrates without extract; and (2) injected <b>mangrove</b> DOM directly into tissues of both sponge species.|$|R

5|$|Mangrove trees {{cover the}} coastlines of South Florida, {{sometimes}} growing inland {{depending on the}} amount of salt water present within the Everglades ecosystems. During drier years when less fresh water flows to the coast, <b>mangroves</b> will appear among fresh water plants.

Three species of mangrove trees—red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa)—can be found in the Everglades. Due to their high tolerance of salt water, winds, extreme tides, high temperatures, and muddy soils, mangrove trees are uniquely adapted to extreme conditions. They act as nurseries for many marine and bird species. They are also Florida's first defense against the destructive forces of hurricanes, absorbing flood waters and preventing coastal erosion.
