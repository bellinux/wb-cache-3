This separation step is not mandatory and is often omitted in NMR and [...] "shotgun" [...] based approaches such as shotgun lipidomics.|$|E
50|$|<b>Metabolomic</b> Pathway Analysis, {{shortened}} to MetPA, is a freely available, user-friendly {{web server}} {{to assist with}} the identification analysis and visualization of metabolic pathways using <b>metabolomic</b> data. MetPA makes use of advances originally developed for pathway analysis in microarray experiments and applies those principles and concepts to the analysis of metabolic pathways. For input, MetPA expects either a list of compound names (identified as statistically significant or significant perturbed) or a metabolite concentration table with phenotypic labels (i.e. sick vs. healthy). The list of compounds can include common names, HMDB IDs or KEGG IDs with one compound per row. Compound concentration tables must have samples in rows and compounds in columns. MetPA’s output is a series of tables indicating which pathways are significantly enriched (along with accompanying statistics) as well as a variety of graphs or pathway maps illustrating where and how certain pathways were enriched. MetPA’s graphical output uses a colorful Google-Maps visualization system that allows simple, intuitive data exploration that lets users employ a computer mouse or track pad to select, drag and place images and to seamlessly zoom in and out. Users can explore MetPA’s output using three different views or levels: 1) a metabolome view; 2) a pathway view; 3) a compound view.|$|E
50|$|As {{late as the}} {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the subject had developed mainly on the botanical side, being particularly concerned with the description and identification of drugs both in their whole state and in powder form. Such branches of pharmacognosy are still of fundamental importance, particularly for pharmacopoeial identification and quality control purposes, but rapid development in other areas has enormously expanded the subject. The advent of the 21st century brought a renaissance of pharmacognosy and its conventional botanical approach has been broadened up to molecular and <b>metabolomic</b> level.|$|E
50|$|In principle, any {{technologies}} {{used for}} metabolomics {{can be used}} for exometabolomics. However, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has been the most widely used. As with typical <b>metabolomic</b> measurements, metabolites are identified based on accurate mass, retention time, and their MS/MS fragmentation patterns, in comparison to authentic standards. Chromatographies typically used are hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography for the measurement of polar metabolites, or reversed-phase (C18) chromatography for the measurement of non-polar compounds, lipids, and secondary metabolites. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry {{can also be used to}} measure sugars and other carbohydrates, and to obtain complete metabolic profiles.|$|E

These efforts have involved both experimental <b>metabolomic</b> analysis (involving NMR, GC-MS, ICP-MS, LC-MS and HPLC assays) {{as well as}} extensive literature mining. According to their data, the human serum metabolome contains at least 4200 different compounds (including many lipids), the human urine metabolome contains at least 3000 different compounds (including 100s of volatiles and gut microbial metabolites), the human CSF metabolome contains nearly 500 different compounds while the human saliva metabolome contains approximately 400 different metabolites, including many bacterial products.|$|E
50|$|The Human Metabolome Database is a freely available, open-access {{database}} containing {{detailed data}} {{on more than}} 40,000 metabolites {{that have already been}} identified or are likely {{to be found in the}} human body. The HMDB contains three kinds of information: 1) chemical information, 2) clinical information, and 3) biochemical information. The chemical data includes >40,000 metabolite structures with detailed descriptions, extensive chemical classifications, synthesis information and observed/calculated chemical properties. It also contains nearly 10,000 experimentally measured NMR, GC-MS and LC/MS spectra from more than 1100 different metabolites. The clinical information includes data on >10,000 metabolite-biofluid concentrations, metabolite concentration information on more than 600 different human diseases and pathway data for more than 200 different inborn errors of metabolism. The biochemical information includes nearly 6000 protein (and DNA) sequences and more than 5000 biochemical reactions that are linked to these metabolite entries. The HMDB supports a wide variety of online queries including text searches, chemical structure searches, sequence similarity searches and spectral similarity searches. This makes it particularly useful for <b>metabolomic</b> researchers who are attempting to identify or understand metabolites in clinical <b>metabolomic</b> studies. The first version of the HMDB was released in Jan. 1 2007 and was compiled by scientists at the University of Alberta and the University of Calgary. At that time they reported data on 2,500 metabolites, 1,200 drugs and 3,500 food components. Since then these scientists have greatly expanded the collection. The latest version of the HMDB (version 3.5) contains >16,000 endogenous metabolites, >1500 drugs and >22,000 food constituents or food metabolites.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>metabolomic</b> {{has been}} {{recently}} introduced {{to address the}} global analysis of all metabolites in a biological sample. A related term, metabonomics, was introduced to refer specifically {{to the analysis of}} metabolic responses to drugs or diseases. Metabonomics has become a major area of research; it is the complex system biological study, used as a method to identify the biomarker for various disease. In general, in most disease cases, a metabolic pathway had or has been either activated or deactivated - this parameter can thus be used as a marker for some diseases. Serotonin production pathways, activated in a person who has recently consumed alcohol for instance, can be a metabolic marker of recent alcohol consumption.|$|E

5000|$|Metabolomics is the {{scientific}} study of chemical processes involving metabolites. Specifically, metabolomics is the [...] "systematic study of the unique chemical fingerprints that specific cellular processes leave behind", the study of their small-molecule metabolite profiles. The metabolome represents the collection of all metabolites in a biological cell, tissue, organ or organism, which are the end products of cellular processes. mRNA gene expression data and proteomic analyses reveal the set of gene products being produced in the cell, data that represents one aspect of cellular function. Conversely, metabolic profiling can give an instantaneous snapshot of the physiology of that cell. One of the challenges of systems biology and functional genomics is to integrate proteomic, transcriptomic, and <b>metabolomic</b> information to provide a better understanding of cellular biology.|$|E
5000|$|To begin {{a session}} on MetPA users must first {{have a list}} of {{significant}} compounds derived from a <b>metabolomic</b> tests or compounds and concentration data with information about the phenotype of the organisms under study. The list of compounds can include common names, HMDB IDs or KEGG IDs with one compound per row. Compound concentration tables must have samples in rows and compounds in columns. Once the data is uploaded to MetPA users must choose the organism with which the pathway analysis will be done. Ideally the <b>metabolomic</b> data should be from one of the 15 model organisms listed in the MetPA organism menu. If the organism or interest is not listed, then users may choose a closely related organism. If none of the organisms are thought to be sufficiently close, then users may inquire with the web site developers to see if the organism may be added. Central to the operation of MetPA is its library of metabolic pathways for different model organisms. These were assembled from the KEGG database [...] which were separated into graphical models using the KEGGgraph package. The current MetPA collection contains more than 1170 different metabolic pathways derived from 15 model organisms covering mammals (Humans, Mouse, Rat, Cow, Chicken), fish (Zebrafish), plants (Arabidopsis, Rice) insects (Drosophila) and microbes (Yeast, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas putida, and Thermotoga maritima.). To simplify viewing and navigation on the server, and to assist with the topological analyses, all the KEGG pathways in MetPA are presented as a network with metabolites serving as nodes and reactions as edges. MetPA provides an extensive tutorial explaining how to upload data and how interpret its output. In 2011 MetPA functions were expanded and integrated into MetaboAnalyst. This integration allows users to perform a more complete analysis and to link to other data processing and data interpretation functions available through MetaboAnalyst.|$|E
