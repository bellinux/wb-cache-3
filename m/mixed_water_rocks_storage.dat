40|$|AbstractDetailed geochemical {{investigations}} of calcite veins, genetically related to intrusions and vein-hosting bedrock, {{have been used}} to indicate fluid evolution during intrusion-related hydrothermal mineralization, involving fluid <b>mixing</b> and <b>water</b> <b>rock</b> interaction. The area of investigation is located in the southeast of Sweden. The 1. 85 Ga granitoid country rocks and the 0. 9 Ga dolerite vein-related intrusions differ in chemical, geochemical, and stable isotope composition. The variation in rare earth and stable isotope composition across calcite veins and the presence of two groups of fluid inclusions suggests mixing of two types of fluids. Light rare earth enrichment and increasing 87 Sr/ 86 Sr-ratios suggest <b>water</b> <b>rock</b> interaction of one/both fluids...|$|R

40|$|Integration of a {{photovoltaic-thermal}} system with housing roofs can replace shingles while generating electricity and heat. This thesis {{is focused on}} energy performance of different configurations of building integrated photovoltaic-thermal (BIPV/T) and HVAC system that utilize recovered heat. A dynamic model for Concordia solar house which included an open loop air-cooled BIPV/T roof system was developed. The thermal network approach with explicit finite difference method was used to simulate the thermal behaviour of the house. The system studied included an air-water heat exchanger for preheating domestic hot water (DHW), <b>water</b> tank and <b>rockbed</b> <b>storage.</b> Predicted temperatures of the preheated air in the BfPV/T systems, PV panels and DHW were obtained and verified with data collected from the solar house. Results showed the dependence of thermo-electrical performance of the BIPV/T roof on the ambient conditions, air velocity, length and PV cavity depth. For the unglazed BIPV/T system, the heated air is suitable {{to be used as}} a preheated air in the HVAC system; for the same reason, thermal <b>rockbed</b> <b>storage</b> is not beneficial for extreme winter conditions with unglazed BIPV/T open loop air system. The BIPV/T system considered is suitable for DHW preheating. By adding 1. 5 m of vertical glazed solar air collector (SAC) at the end of the unglazed B 1 PV/T section, significant air temperature increase at the outlet of the PV cavity can be achieved in winter and it is suitable for combination with the <b>rockbed</b> <b>storage.</b> With passing the air behind the absorber of the SAC and placing a low-emissivity coating on a glass cover, higher exiting air temperatures can be achieved. Appropriate air velocities in the PV cavity that limit the PV panel temperature of the glazed BIPV/T roof were determine...|$|R

The acidity of peat water can damage the quality and service life of concrete in the long term.

This study aims to measure the mechanical properties such as compressive strength, tensile strength and modulus elasticity of concrete with a compressive strength of 35 MPa. Concrete compressive strength OPC and OPC + 10 % POFA using peat <b>water</b> as <b>mixing</b> <b>water</b> has decreased by 8. 33 % and 6. 33 % of the compressive strength of normal concrete.

Recycled water was used to replace municipal water at various proportions of 0, 30, 50 and 100 %, then used as <b>mix</b> <b>water.</b> Tests were done on fresh and hardened concretes and mortars.

In general, the three Matthiola cultivars produced the highest flower yields kg m - 2 when irrigated with the UF water type compared to the EF and <b>Mix</b> <b>water</b> treatments. The significantly highest flower yield was recorded for the yellow and lavender cultivars irrigated with the UF water type, while the lowest flower yields were recorded for the three cultivars irrigated with the <b>Mix</b> <b>water</b> treatment. This increase in flower yield weight was accompanied with better flower quality and higher percentages of tissue dry weight.

40|$|The {{vibrational}} spectroscopy of the nitrate-water isotopologues is {{studied in the}} O-H and O-D stretching regions using temperature-dependent infrared multiple photon dissociation spectroscopy combined with anharmonic electronic structure calculations. At a temperature of 15 K a series of discrete peaks is observed in the IRMPD spectra of [(NO 3 -) (H 2 O) ], [(NO 3 -) (HDO) ] and [(NO 3 -) (D 2 O) ]. This structure is considerably more complex than predicted by harmonic calculations. Signal is only observed in the hydrogen-bonded O-H (O-D) stretching region, characteristic of a double hydrogen-bond donor binding motif. With increasing temperature the peaks broaden, leading to a quasi-continuous absorption from 3150 - 3600 cm - 1 (2300 - 2700 cm - 1) for [(NO 3 -) (H 2 O) ] ([(NO 3 -) (D 2 O) ]) and, above 100 K, an additional band in the free O-H (O-D) stretching region, suggesting the population of complexes containing only a single hydrogen-bond at higher internal energies. Vibrational configuration interaction calculations confirm {{that much of the}} structure observed in the IRMPD spectra derives from progressions in the <b>water</b> <b>rock</b> resulting from strong cubic coupling between the O-H (O-D) stretch and <b>water</b> <b>rock</b> degrees of freedom. The spectra of both [(NO 3 -) (H 2 O) ] and [(NO 3 -) (D 2 O) ] display a strong peak that does not derive from the <b>water</b> <b>rock</b> progression but results instead from a Fermi resonance between the O-H (O-D) stretch and H-O-H (D-O-D) bend overtone. Additional insight into the nature of the O-H (O-D) stretch and <b>water</b> <b>rocking</b> coupling in these complexes is provided by an effective Hamiltonian that allows for the cubic coupling between the O-H stretch and <b>water</b> <b>rock</b> degrees of freedom...|$|R
