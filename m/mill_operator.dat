5|$|William A. Foote was a 30-year-old grist <b>mill</b> <b>operator</b> in Adrian, Michigan, in 1884 when, in {{what was}} then a common occurrence, he {{provided}} space and shaft power from his mill wheel to Thomson - Houston, a local electric utility startup, to light 12 streetlights. Fascinated by the potential, within a year he enlisted his then 17-year-old brother James and moved to Jackson, Michigan, and in 1886 they jointly founded Jackson Electric Light Works (a predecessor company to Consumers Energy), which began by lighting downtown Jackson electrically. The Foote brothers set up similar city specific companies in Battle Creek and Adrian within a few years. In many cases dams already built for grist mills, sawmills and the like were refit for electric generators, but in some cases, new dams were constructed. As the familiarity with the technology, and the technology itself, improved, the scope of projects became more ambitious.|$|E

50|$|In {{machine-assisted}} wet processing, fermentation is {{not used}} to separate the bean from {{the remainder of the}} pulp; rather, this is done through mechanical scrubbing. This process can cut down on water use and pollution since ferment and wash water stinks. In addition, removing mucilage by machine is easier and more predictable than removing it by fermenting and washing. However, by eliminating the fermentation step and prematurely separating fruit and bean, mechanical demucilaging can remove an important tool that <b>mill</b> <b>operators</b> have of influencing coffee flavor. Furthermore, the ecological criticism of the ferment-and-wash method increasingly has become moot, since a combination of low-water equipment plus settling tanks allows conscientious <b>mill</b> <b>operators</b> to carry out fermentation with limited pollution.|$|R
25|$|John Huy Addams {{was born}} in Sinking Spring, Pennsylvania in on July 12, 1822. He married Sarah Weber, five years his elder, while still living in Kreidersville, Pennsylvania. Both families, Addams and Weber, were from old Pennsylvanian lineage; Addams' {{ancestors}} had been granted by land by William Penn in the 17th century. In 1844 Addams, then 22, and his new bride arrived in Cedarville, Illinois, near the Illinois-Wisconsin state border in Stephenson County. Addams established himself quickly as a successful <b>mill</b> <b>operator</b> when he purchased the Cedar Creek Mill in 1844. When the couple first arrived in Stephenson County {{they lived in a}} small two-room home with a loft. In 1854 Addams completed construction on an addition which made the Addams' home a much larger, prominent Federal style house. Though the couple had nine children, only four survived to adulthood; their eighth child was Nobel Peace Prize recipient Jane Addams, born at the Addams House in Cedarville on September 6, 1860.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} mill was {{powered by}} a vertical waterwheel; the mill, at the time, utilized buhrstones to grind the meal. On the nearby property, discarded buried buhrstones can be found. In the 1870s or 1880s the mill owners added a [...] turbine to help the mill keep up with advances in technology. In 1888 Schriner installed a set of rollers, manufactured by Barkley and Leads Machine Company of Moline, Illinois, at the demand of his <b>mill</b> <b>operator,</b> Amos Greater, who had threatened to quit absent the rollers.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Oil palm is now {{accepted}} {{as one of}} the most important oil-producing crops in the world. The bid to ensure efficient and quality production has resulted in the invention of machines that have greatly reduced human labour in the production process. Separation of cracked mixture to recover the kernels is one of the most important activities in Palm Kernel oil (PKO) production process. Research has led to the invention of the clay-bath and hydro-cyclones for the recovery of kernels from the cracked mixture. However, these machines are very costly to install and operate and as well require skilled labour. This research work is intended to examine these innovations and recommend suitable adaptations of these machines for use by the small scale <b>mill</b> <b>operators</b> who cannot afford the modern machines and the technical know-how needed to operate them. The clay-bath has been recommended for local <b>mill</b> <b>operators</b> for cracked mixture separation due to its ease of use and scalability...|$|R

50|$|The Mechanics Block Historic District is a {{historic}} district at 107 - 139 Garden St. and 6 - 38 Orchard Street in Lawrence, Massachusetts.

50|$|Motive {{power was}} {{initially}} provided by horses, but later a unique Aveling and Porter steam locomotive was employed.

50|$|<b>Mill</b> <b>operators</b> {{generally}} {{built their}} lumber loading facilities {{on the lee}} (usually the south) side of a point. This allowed the land to break {{the force of the}} waves and caused the direction of the swells to roll straight into the cove. Schooners moored with their bows pointed directly into the waves so that they pitched (the ship going up and down along its long axis) but did not roll (going up and down along its crosswise axis).
