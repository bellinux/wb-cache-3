25|$|Most of the {{economic}} traits are controlled by genes with small but cumulative effects. Although the potential of DH populations in quantitative genetics has been understood for some time, it was the advent of <b>molecular</b> <b>marker</b> maps that provided the impetus for their use in identifying loci controlling quantitative traits. As the quantitative trait loci (QTL) effects are small and highly influenced by environmental factors, accurate phenotyping with replicated trials is needed. This is possible with doubled haploidy organisms because of their true breeding nature and because they can conveniently be produced in large numbers. Using DH populations, 130 quantitative traits have been mapped in nine crop species. In total, 56 DH populations were used for QTL detection.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{maps are}} very {{important}} to understand the structure and organization of genomes from which evolution patterns and syntenic relationships between species can be deduced. Genetic maps also provide a framework for the mapping of genes of interest and estimating the magnitude of their effects and aid our understanding of genotype/phenotype associations. DH populations have become standard resources in genetic mapping for species in which DHs are readily available. Doubled haploid populations are ideal for genetic mapping. It is possible to produce a genetic map within two years of the initial cross regardless of the species. Map construction is relatively easy using a DH population derived from a hybrid of two homozygous parents as the expected segregation ratio is simple, i.e. 1:1. DH populations have now been used to produce genetic maps of barley, rapeseed, rice, wheat, and pepper. DH populations {{played a major role in}} facilitating the generation of the <b>molecular</b> <b>marker</b> maps in eight crop species.|$|E
25|$|In {{backcross}} conversion, {{genes are}} introgressed from a donor cultivar or related species into a recipient elite line through repeated backcrossing. A {{problem in this}} procedure {{is being able to}} identify the lines carrying the trait of interest at each generation. The problem is particularly acute if the trait of interest is recessive, as it will be present only in a heterozygous condition after each backcross. The development of molecular markers provides an easier method of selection based on the genotype (marker) rather than the phenotype. Combined with doubled haploidy it becomes more effective. In marker assisted backcross conversion, a recipient parent is crossed with a donor line and the hybrid (F1) backcrossed to the recipient. The resulting generation (BC1) is backcrossed and the process repeated until the desired genotypes are produced. The combination of doubled haploidy and <b>molecular</b> <b>marker</b> provides the short cut. In the back cross generation one itself a genotype with the character of interest can be selected and converted into homozygous doubled haploid genotype. Chen et al. (1994) used marker assisted backcross conversion with doubled haploidy of BC1 individuals to select stripe rust resistant lines in barley.|$|E

40|$|To {{choose one}} or more {{appropriate}} <b>molecular</b> <b>markers</b> or gene regions for resolving a particular systematic question among the organisms at a certain categorical level {{is still a very}} difficult process. The primary goal of this review, therefore, is to provide a theoretical information in choosing {{one or more}} <b>molecular</b> <b>markers</b> or gene regions by illustrating general properties and phylogenetic utilities of nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that have been most commonly used for phylogenetic researches. The highly conserved <b>molecular</b> <b>markers</b> and/or gene regions are useful for investigating phylogenetic relationships at higher categorical levels (deep branches of evolutionary history). On the other hand, the hypervariable <b>molecular</b> <b>markers</b> and/or gene regions are useful for elucidating phylogenetic relationships at lower categorical levels (recently diverged branches). In summary, different selective forces have led to the evolution of various <b>molecular</b> <b>markers</b> or gene regions with varying degrees of sequence conservation. Thus, appropriate <b>molecular</b> <b>markers</b> or gene regions should be chosen with even greater caution to deduce true phylogenetic relationships over a broad taxonomic spectrum...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: We tested {{whether the}} {{combination}} of 4 established cell cycle regulators (p 53, pRB, p 21 and p 27) could improve the ability to predict clinical outcomes in a large multi-institutional collaboration of patients with pT 3 - 4 N 0 or pTany Npositive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. We also assessed whether {{the combination of}} <b>molecular</b> <b>markers</b> is superior to any individual biomarker. Materials and Methods: The study comprised 692 patients with pT 3 - 4 N 0 or pTany Npositive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder treated with radical cystectomy and bilateral lymphadenectomy (median followup 5. 3 years). Scoring was performed using advanced cell imaging and color detection software. The base model incorporated patient age, gender, stage, grade, lymphovascular invasion, number of lymph nodes removed, number of positive lymph nodes, concomitant carcinoma in situ and adjuvant chemotherapy. Results: Individual <b>molecular</b> <b>markers</b> did not improve the predictive accuracy for disease recurrence and cancer specific mortality. Combination of all 4 <b>molecular</b> <b>markers</b> into number of altered <b>molecular</b> <b>markers</b> resulted in significantly 1 higher predictive accuracy than any single biomarker (p < 0. 001.). Moreover addition of number of altered <b>molecular</b> <b>markers</b> to the base model significantly improved the predictive accuracy for disease recurrence (3. 9 %, p < 0. 001) and cancer specific mortality (4. 3 %, p < 0. 001). Addition of number of altered <b>molecular</b> <b>markers</b> retained statistical significance for improving the prediction of clinical outcomes in the subgroup of patients with pT 3 N 0 (280), pT 4 N 0 (83) and pTany Npositive (329) disease (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: While the status of individual <b>molecular</b> <b>markers</b> does not add sufficient value to outcome prediction in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, combinations of <b>molecular</b> <b>markers</b> may improve <b>molecular</b> staging, prognostication and possibly prediction of response to therapy...|$|R

40|$|AGAP : équipe GE 2 popDiversity and {{structure}} of populations may differ substantially between morphological traits and <b>molecular</b> <b>markers.</b> Explanations of such discrepancies are crucial for further progress in breeding {{as well as for}} the maintenance of genetic resources. Our objective was to compare indices of among-cultivars differentiation for morphological traits (QST) and <b>molecular</b> <b>markers</b> (FST) in alfalfa (Medicago sativa),a legume forage species. Ten cultivars representing the Northern and Southern types commonly grown in Europe were investigated. For each cultivar, 40 genotypes were analysed with 16 SSR markers and four morphological traits measured in two locations and several cuts. QST values were in general high(0. 02 – 0. 39) compared to the differentiation observed with <b>molecular</b> <b>markers</b> (FST = 0. 01), especially for growth habit, indicating that morphological traits were more efficient to structure the diversity than <b>molecular</b> <b>markers.</b> For morphological traits, a clear separation of Northern and Southern cultivars was observed, whereas for <b>molecular</b> <b>markers,</b> no clear structure was detected. Nevertheless, the grazing type cultivar Luzelle was separated from the rest of the cultivars for both morphological traits and <b>molecular</b> <b>markers.</b> Although pairwise differences between cultivars were significant for both morphological traits and <b>molecular</b> <b>markers,</b> the main part of the variation was found within cultivars. This large within-cultivar variation may be explained, besides the outcrossing reproductive mode and auto tetraploid genetics, by the recent history of M. sativa domestication in Europe and the frequent seed exchanges.

The <b>molecular</b> <b>markers</b> are becoming essential tools in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding since they offer alternative solutions to many breeding problems resulting from the traditional phenotypic markers that are difficult and/or time-consuming to select by plant breeders.
