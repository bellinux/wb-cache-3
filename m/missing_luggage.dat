5|$|Bessell, {{anxious to}} be of service to his party's highest-profile figure, flew to Dublin in April 1965. He found that Josiffe was being advised by a {{sympathetic}} Jesuit priest, Father Sweetman, who believed {{that at least some}} of Josiffe's allegations might be true; otherwise, he asked Bessell, why had he flown all the way from London to deal with them? Bessell warned Josiffe of the consequences of attempting to blackmail a public figure, but in a more conciliatory vein promised to help recover the <b>missing</b> <b>luggage</b> and insurance card. He also hinted at the possibility of an equestrian job in America. Bessell's intervention appeared to contain the problem, particularly as Josiffe's suitcase was recovered shortly afterwards—although, according to Josiffe, letters implicating Thorpe had been removed. For most of the following two years Josiffe remained largely quiescent in Ireland, attempting to establish himself in various careers; part of this time was spent in a monastery. It was during this period that he formally adopted the name of Scott.|$|E
500|$|By early 1965 Josiffe was in Dublin, {{where he}} worked at various horse-related jobs while {{continuing}} to badger Thorpe by letter about his <b>missing</b> <b>luggage</b> and the continuing National Insurance card issue. However, Thorpe rejected any responsibility for these matters. In mid-March 1965 Josiffe wrote a long letter to Thorpe's mother, which began: [...] "For the last five years, as you probably know, Jeremy and I have had a homosexual relationship." [...] The letter blamed Thorpe for awakening [...] "this vice that lies latent in every man", and accused him of callousness and disloyalty. Ursula Thorpe gave the letter to her son, who drafted a quasi-legal statement rejecting the [...] "damaging and groundless accusations" [...] and accusing Josiffe of attempting to blackmail him. The document was never sent; instead, Thorpe turned to Bessell for advice.|$|E
50|$|The Victoria Transit Patrol {{was formed}} in 1878 after the Victoria Railway Commissioner {{determined}} {{that there was a}} need for a detective to investigate crimes, <b>missing</b> <b>luggage</b> and freight, and accidents that took place on the railway system. They were expanded in 1890 with the introduction of officers who made random checks at railway stations to arrest those who evaded fares. These officers were initially referred to as “Flying Gangs” but were later called Ticket Examiners.|$|E

[...] And {{then he went}} on to explain in a few hurried words to Frida, with sundry shrugs and nods of profoundest import, that the {{supposed}} lunatic or murderer or foreigner or fool had gone to <b>Miss</b> Blake's without <b>luggage</b> of any sort; and that, [...] "Perhaps"--very dubitatively--"a portmanteau or bag might help him out of his temporary difficulties." ...|$|R

Then his eyes, following her look and mine, lit on the cluster of lamps in the drawer. He gave a sort of cry of surprise and joy as he bent over and touched them: ...|$|R
50|$|On May 6, 2012, Raymart Santiago, {{along with}} Claudine Barretto and his 8-man entourage, {{assaulted}} a known journalist and senior citizen, Ramon Tulfo, due to Ramon purportedly using his mobile phone to take photos of Claudine screaming at and humiliating a ground attendant of Cebu Pacific concerning <b>missing</b> <b>luggage</b> which supposedly contained asthma medicine for their friend's children. This occurred within NAIA Terminal 3 in a location {{not covered by}} CCTV. Witnesses state that the brawl began when Raymart and his entourage surrounded Tulfo and demanded that he hand over his phone. Ramon refused and the assault commenced.|$|E

5000|$|One of Tchaikovsky's {{favorite}} anecdotes {{resulted from}} his nearly losing the sketches for the Little Russian {{on the way}} back to Moscow. To persuade a recalcitrant postmaster to hitch the horses to the coach in which he and his brother Modest had been travelling, Tchaikovsky presented himself as [...] "Prince Volkonsky, gentleman of the Emperor's bedchamber." [...] When they reached their evening stop, he noticed his <b>luggage</b> <b>missing</b> - including his work on the symphony. Fearing the postmaster had opened the luggage and learned his identity, he sent someone to fetch it. The intermediary returned empty-handed. The postmaster would only release the luggage to the prince himself.|$|R
6000|$|Acting on {{instinct}} {{rather than}} on reason, she had kept that remarkable incident in her school life a secret from every one. No discoveries {{had been made by}} other persons. In speaking to her staff of teachers, Miss Ladd had alluded to the affair in the most cautious terms. [...] "Circumstances of a private nature have obliged the lady to retire from my school. When we meet after the holidays, another teacher will be in her place." [...] There, Miss Ladd's explanation had begun and ended. Inquiries addressed to the servants had led to no result. <b>Miss</b> Jethro's <b>luggage</b> was to be forwarded to the London terminus of the railway--and Miss Jethro herself had baffled investigation by leaving the school on foot. Emily's interest in the lost teacher was not the transitory interest of curiosity; her father's mysterious friend was a person whom she honestly desired to see again. Perplexed by the difficulty of finding a means of tracing Miss Jethro, she reached the shady limit of the trees, and turned to walk back again. Approaching the place at which she and Francine had met, an idea occurred to her. It was just possible that Miss Jethro might not be unknown to her aunt.|$|R
60|$|She had {{not left}} the hotel {{more than ten}} minutes, before a little note in pencil was brought to Lady Montbarry by the housekeeper. The writer proved to be no less a person than the widow lady who {{occupied}} the room {{on the other side}} of the drawing-room, which her ladyship had vainly hoped to secure for Agnes. Writing under the name of Mrs. James, the polite widow explained that she had heard from the housekeeper of the disappointment experienced by Lady Montbarry in the matter of the rooms. Mrs. James was quite alone; and as long as her bed-chamber was airy and comfortable, it mattered nothing to her whether she slept on the first or the second floor of the house. She had accordingly much pleasure in proposing to change rooms with <b>Miss</b> Lockwood. Her <b>luggage</b> had already been removed, and Miss Lockwood had only to take possession of the room (Number 13 A), which was now entirely at her disposal.|$|R

5000|$|In July 2015, on {{application}} by the parties, Smith recused himself {{from being the}} judge in long running multi-party proceedings between various airlines. The judge's personal luggage, together with that of other passengers, had failed to arrive in London after a flight from Florence. Smith corresponded with {{the chief executive of}} British Airways (BA), suggesting that BA may have taken a deliberate decision not to carry the passengers' luggage and that this may have been in order to make additional profit from the conveyance of cargo on that flight. A number of the parties to the litigation applied for Smith to recuse himself from further part in the case. During the hearing, Smith repeatedly asked counsel for BA what had happened to his luggage, receiving the response that the proceedings were not appropriate for dealing with a personal dispute. [...] In due course Smith agreed to recuse himself. [...] In his judgment of 22 July 2015 he set out a detailed account of the occasion when the luggage went missing, and suggested that the true issue in the case was that the <b>missing</b> <b>luggage</b> gave rise to issues which were similar to some of the allegations in the case which he had to try, so that (if they were correct) {{he would have had to}} recuse himself. He said that he would continue his investigation into the luggage issue [...] "in a private capacity ... with the vigour for which I am known".|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{automatic}} identification of components {{is one of}} the most important research fields for researchers and scientists in different arenas. RFID Technology {{is one of the}} technologies widely used in this arena. For this purpose, the present research has dealt with this technology as a means of tracking and identifying baggage automatically in a traffic control system in an airport. The specification of RFID Technology helps distinguish between man and objects with high precision. This paper makes use of this capability for identifying and tracking baggage in an airport and plane in order to increase the efficiency of luggage transport system, which, as a result, increases the precision of the system, decreases the damages arising from the <b>missing</b> of the <b>luggage</b> and its wrong transport and decreases the errors of the manpower. In order to obtain an intelligent system and automatically identify objects, a unique number is required for tracking and control each object. This research has defined a new model with four choices (that is, airline name, flight number, nature of tag and chair number) in order to develop a unique identity number. This number is stored in the tag memory. With such tags passing through RFID Readers embedded at different places including the conveyor belt or at the gates, passengers’ luggage may be easily tracked. This way, any problem can be easily dealt with. Thanks to its adaptability, this technology can be easily used in computerized network for sending and receiving information; and an information bank has also been used to instantaneously analyze and study the information...|$|R
40|$|The {{movement}} of passengers through an airport quickly, safely, and efficiently {{is the main}} function of the various checkpoints (check-in, security. etc) found in airports. Human error combined with other breakdowns in the complex system of the airport can disrupt passenger flow through the airport leading to lengthy waiting times, <b>missing</b> <b>luggage</b> and missed flights. In this paper we present a model of passenger flow through an airport using discrete event simulation that will provide a closer look into the possible reasons for breakdowns and their implications for passenger flow. The simulation is based on data collected at Norfolk International Airport (ORF). The primary goal of this simulation is to present ways to optimize the work force to keep passenger flow smooth even during peak travel times and for emergency preparedness at ORF in case of adverse events. In this simulation we ran three different scenarios: real world, increased check-in stations, and multiple waiting lines. Increased check-in stations increased waiting time and instantaneous utilization. while the multiple waiting lines decreased both the waiting time and instantaneous utilization. This simulation was able to show how different changes affected the passenger flow through the airport...|$|E
