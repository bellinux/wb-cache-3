500|$|The main defence {{on the use}} {{of secret}} reserve {{accounting}} came with the help of Lord Plender. Plender {{was one of the most}} important and reliable accountants in Britain, and under cross-examination stated that it was routine for firms [...] "of the very highest repute" [...] to use secret reserves in calculating profit without declaring it. Patrick Hastings said that [...] "if <b>my</b> <b>client...</b> was guilty of a criminal offence, there is not a single accountant in the City of London or in the world who is not in the same position." [...] Both Kylsant and Moreland were acquitted of counts 1 and 2, but Kylsant was found guilty on count 3 and was sentenced to 12 months in prison.|$|E

[...] Hochuli finds similarities between the football field and courtroom saying, [...] "On the football field, people like that I'm in charge and know what I'm doing, {{but a lot of the}} time, it's just appearance. [...] I'm going to sell you on my decision. It's the same in the courtroom. You don't stand in front of a jury and say, 'I think <b>my</b> <b>client</b> is innocent.' You say, 'We're right!'" ...|$|E

500|$|The lawsuit {{alleges that}} Sony induced King’s release from his {{publishing}} contract {{and refused to}} pay compensation. The attorney Alicia Roman told The Huffington Post, [...] " [...] annul the release due to the fraud they committed. When it’s annulled, all of the rights to Elijah’s songs are returned to <b>my</b> <b>client,</b> particularly the song 'Vida' that Ricky Martin sang." [...] Martin has not made any comment on the lawsuit. Additionally, Luis Adrian Cortes Ramos, a finalist from the first season of Idol Puerto Rico filled a $10 million lawsuit towards Martin. He sued the singer for releasing [...] "Vida" [...] despite claims that he submitted {{his version of the}} track as part of SuperSong contest, a version that was never recognized. Ramos' lawyer released a statement saying [...] "Ramos was surprised, disillusioned and suffered mental anguish because the song was almost identical to the one he composed. Until that moment, Martin was an idol for Ramos." [...] However, Martin's representative never commented on the lawsuit.|$|E
500|$|In December 2010 Hodgson was {{returned}} to prison awaiting trial over new and unconnected allegations of rape and sexual assault of a 22-year-old woman with learning difficulties at a care home in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, in August 2010. On 3March 2011, Hodgson pleaded guilty at Durham Crown Court to sexual touching but denied rape. David Crook, prosecuting, {{said that he would}} offer no evidence on the rape charge, which was withdrawn. Hodgson's solicitor, Julian Young, said: [...] "The wrongful imprisonment for 27 years of <b>my</b> <b>client</b> has had a devastating effect on his life since he was cleared of the murder he did not commit [...] has been gripped by a number of personal difficulties, including a degree of alcohol abuse." [...] The judge, Mr.Justice Prince, requested the preparation of pre-sentence reports {{to address the issue of}} Hodgson's dangerousness, and Hodgson was remanded in custody. On 13May 2011 he was sentenced to a three-year community order. The judge said that the total of 156 days Hodgson had been remanded in custody prior to sentence would be taken into account, and told Hodgson he [...] "could walk free should he agree to complete a psychiatric order imposed by the court, but his barrister Martin Heslop QC, said his client 'clearly bears a great resentment against a criminal justice system which has deprived him of 27 years of liberty'" [...] and rejected the option.|$|E

But I also make broad studies which may serve to help <b>my</b> <b>clients</b> reorient their thinking. They want to know the market, and that means total defense problems. I can't be narrow in my thinking. Lots of times, <b>my</b> <b>clients</b> don't agree with me. They don't expect to.” ...|$|R

"It's been {{dozens and}} dozens of {{comments}} where [...] essentially indicted <b>my</b> <b>client.</b> He's characterized my client's actions as being heinous without even seeing the videotape. So when the mayor of the city in which the pool of jurors is drawn from has taken such an adamant stance, it makes it extremely difficult for us to get a juror in here who is not predisposed to a finding of guilt."If convicted of first-degree murder, Van Dyke faces a prison sentence of 20 years to life.

2500|$|For {{the latter}} half of his argument, he {{addressed}} the lesser-included issue. At trial, the jury had deliberated for three hours. Since Schmuck had admitted to the odometer tampering, [...] "the only thing the jury could have been out considering was is this really mail fraud. Are these mailings really sufficiently closely related to what <b>my</b> <b>client</b> was trying to do to be mail fraud?" [...] he posited them asking themselves. [...] "I think it's clear from that record that a lesser instruction on odometer tampering had at least an arguable chance of success." [...] The justices asked no questions, and Steinberg asked to reserve his remaining time for rebuttal.|$|E
2500|$|The State of Nebraska then {{appealed to}} the U.S. Supreme Court. [...] The Supreme Court decided Wolff v. Rice, along with a {{landmark}} Fourth Amendment case, Stone v. Powell (July 6, 1976), 428 US 465. The Court held that Fourth Amendment claims {{would no longer be}} appealed through the federal courts on a writ of habeas corpus. Beginning with Stone v. Powell, state prisoners could only appeal Fourth Amendment claims to the U.S. Supreme Court on a writ of certiorari from the state's supreme court. Rice's appellate counsel, Father William Cunningham, a Jesuit priest, said to the U.S. Supreme Court during oral arguments, [...] "Do you mean to tell <b>my</b> <b>client,</b> after all this time, that he has pursued the wrong legal avenue?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{would seem}} that a student of human nature, such as every {{successful}} writer should be, might by this time have arrived at some conception of <b>my</b> <b>client's</b> character, simple as it was, and have learned to overlook the slight peculiarity in his mode of expressing himself. But here the Celebrity fell short, if <b>my</b> <b>client's</b> emotions were not pitched in the same key as those of other people, who shall say that his heart was not as large or his sympathies as wide as many another philanthropist? ...|$|R

2500|$|On 15 October 2008, five Scottish judges decided {{unanimously}} {{to reject}} a submission by the Crown Office {{which sought to}} limit the scope of Megrahi's second appeal to the specific grounds of appeal that were identified by the SCCRC in June 2007. In January 2009, it was reported that, although Megrahi's second appeal against conviction was scheduled to begin in April 2009, the hearing could {{last as long as}} 12 months because of the complexity of the case and volume of material to be examined. The second appeal began on 28 April 2009, lasted for one month and was adjourned in May 2009. On 7 July 2009, the court reassembled for a procedural hearing and was told that because of the illness of one of the judges, Lord Wheatley, who was recovering from heart surgery, the final two substantive appeal sessions would run from 2 November to 11 December 2009, and 12 January to 26 February 2010. Megrahi's lawyer Maggie Scott expressed dismay at the delays: [...] "There is a very serious danger that <b>my</b> <b>client</b> will die before the case is determined." ...|$|E

Many of <b>my</b> <b>clients</b> were {{born and raised in}} the Bloomington-Normal area.
