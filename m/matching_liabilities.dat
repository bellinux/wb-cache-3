40|$|This paper explores ways {{in which}} risk taking is entwined with {{financial}} considerations, and examines the trade-off between acceptable levels of risk and associated costs. The changing identity of holders of funds available for risk investment, combined with the evolving attitudes of fund-seekers as {{to the nature of}} acceptable risks, points to the need for a re-examination of traditional approaches. In formulating public policy aimed at reducing risks a more formal consideration of the overall cost of Government measures, set against the achievements anticipated from the measure concerned, is required whether or not that cost falls on Government. In commerce, increased use of joint ventures is seen as a likely vehicle for the development of largescale risk activities, with a loan guarantee scheme to assist in nurturing new enterprises and small businesses. Finally, the role of pension funds is examined and a case made for the consideration of index linked gilts as a means both of assisting the Government with the orderly handling of the National Debt and meeting the pension schemes' need to <b>match</b> <b>liabilities</b> that are susceptible to inflationary pressures. ...|$|R

The Study involved six local government authorities which included Tarime, Musoma Municipality, Musoma District Council,Serengeti, Rorya and Bunda. Mixed approach, qualitative and quantitative, that applied a survey design was used. A sample of 66 respondents, 54 accountants and 12 external auditors, was reached to collect data through structured and semi structured questionnaires. The quantitative data was analyzed using Karl Pearson Coefficient of Correlation whereas the qualitative data was analyzed by descriptive analysis to show frequencies and percentages. The findings indicate {{that there is a}} negative relationship between the sound working capital strategies and own source income and liquidity capacities of the LGAs. It was also found that, if the LGAs would improve on the current assets levels, own income and liquidity capacities would be optimized. The study recommends the government to take interest on the topic to conduct more researches. The LGAs are advised to be result oriented to stick on building structures instead of concentrating on recurrent payments, to see the possibility of introducing municipal bonds, to apply the strategy of <b>matching</b> <b>liabilities</b> and assets and to apply the current ratio of 2 to 1 and quick ratio of 1 to 1 to avoid excessive cash that would be invested to reap more own source revenue...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} how {{standard}} exchange-traded fixed-income derivatives (futures and options on futures contracts) can {{be included in}} a sound risk and asset management process so as to improve risk and return performance characteristics of managed portfolios. Our results show that the non-linear character of the returns on protective option strategies offers appealing risk reduction properties in the pure asset management context. Consequently, such strategies should optimally receive a significant allocation, especially when investors are concerned with minimising extreme risks. In an asset liability management context, we also show that fixed-income derivatives in general, and recently launched long-term futures contracts in particular, offer significant shortfall risk reduction benefits.

40|$|In a {{previous}} MITACS project {{in collaboration with}} Addenda Capital, two basic <b>liability</b> <b>matching</b> strategies have been investigated: cash flow matching and moment matching. These strategies performed well under {{a wide variety of}} tests including historical backtesting. A potential shortcoming for both of these methods is that the optimization process is done only once {{at the beginning of the}} investment horizon and uses deterministic moment matching constraints to immunize the portfolio against interest rate movements. Though the portfolio subsequently need to be frquently rebalanced, this static optimization does not take into account the relatively high rebalancing costs it involves. The main objective of this present project is to further enhance the moment matching method by implementing and testing a stochastic dynamic optimization and by comparing its efficiency with the static one. Our dynamic optimization problem is to minimize the portfolio cost and its expected rebalancing costs one month ahead over a set of interest rate scenarios by the use of stochastic moment matching constraints. Our backtesting results show some improvements with the 6 moments matching strategy as the dynamic optimization slightly shrinks the difference in asset-liability gap between scenarios compared with the static optimization. However, after analyzing the realized periodic rebalancing costs each month (a constant bid-ask spread has been assigned to each asset's position change in the optimal portfolio), the immunization improvements are mitigated by substantialy higher costs. We also noticed, in the case of the duration/convexity matching strategy, that the dynamic optimization is not that much more efficient than the static method. Thus, these results confirm that the 6 moments matching technique is still more efficient with both the static and stochastic dynamic optimization. Our extensive dynamic analysis of transaction costs through backtesting showed that from an efficiency to cost ratio and an efficiency to simplicity ratio, the static 6 moments matching method seems so far to be a more practical solution for <b>liability</b> <b>matching...</b>|$|R
40|$|Asset - Liability {{management}} {{is one of}} the most critical tasks for any financial institution for determining its cushion against the risk and the net returns. The problem of asset liability management for an insurance company requires matching the cash inflows from premium collections and investment income with the cash outflows due to casualty and maturity claims. Thus, what is required is a prudent investment strategy such that the returns earned on the assets <b>match</b> the <b>liability</b> claims at all points of time in future. Conventionally, the asset allocation has been done using the Mean Variance approach due to Markowitz (1952, 1959). While such a strategy ensures that the asset value always match or are greater than the liability for the next year, it does not maximise the net worth of the firm nor does it take care of all the cash inflows and outflows over a long term period. A stochastic linear programming model (on the lines of Pirbhai, 2004) maximises the net worth of the firm and also takes care of the uncertainties. While there are instances of stochastic linear programming being applied for ALM in financial institutions in developed markets, no such practical application has been reported in this area in Indian context as yet. In this paper, we describe the development of a multi stage stochastic linear programming model for insurance companies. The multi-stage stochastic linear programming model was developed on the modelling language AMPL (Fourer, 2002). ...|$|R
