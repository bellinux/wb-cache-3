In Handbook of Psychobiography Elms describes Southey's tale not as one of Bettelheimian post-Oedipal ego development but as one of Freudian pre-Oedipal anality. He believes the story appeals chiefly to preschoolers who are engaged in [...] "cleanliness training, maintaining environmental and behavioral order, and distress about disruption of order". His own experience and his observation of others lead him to believe children align themselves with the tidy, organized ursine protagonists rather than the unruly, delinquent human antagonist. In Elms's view, the anality of [...] "The Story of the Three Bears" [...] can be traced directly to Robert Southey's fastidious, dirt-obsessed aunt who raised him and passed her obsession to him in a milder form.|$|E

The film {{was based upon}} the 1914 Bengali novel by Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay. This version {{of the film is}} {{considered}} to be the most faithful adaptation of the novella, particularly due to Meena Kumari's interpretation of the role of Lalita. After the success of Parineeta, Bimal Roy was very much keen to cast Kumari in his next venture titled Devdas in the role of 'Paaro'. However, things with Kamal Amrohi never materialised and the audience lost the golden opportunity to see Kumari essaying the iconic role of 'Paaro' in the film. Do Bigha Zamin - directed by Bimal Roy, was celebrated as the first Indian film to win the International Prize at Cannes in 1954.

The mental worlds have wildly differing art and level design aesthetics, but generally have a specific goal that Raz must complete to help resolve a psychological issue a character may have, allowing the game's plot to progress. Within the mental worlds are censors that react negatively to Raz's presence and will attack him. There are also various collectibles within the mental worlds, including [...] "figments" [...] of the character's imagination which help increase Raz's psi ranking, [...] "emotional baggage" [...] which can be sorted by finding tags and bringing them to the baggage, and [...] "memory vaults" [...] which can unlock a short series of slides providing extra information on that character's backstory.
