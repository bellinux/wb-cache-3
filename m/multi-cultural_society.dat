25|$|Danish People's Party's stated {{goals are}} {{to protect the}} freedom and {{cultural}} heritage of the Danish people, including the family, the Monarchy and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Denmark, to enforce a strict rule of law, to work against Denmark becoming a <b>multi-cultural</b> <b>society</b> by limiting immigration and promoting cultural assimilation of admitted immigrants, to maintain a strong welfare system for those in need, and to promote entrepreneurship and economic growth by strengthening education and encouraging people to work, {{and to protect the}} environment and natural resources. In comparison to its predecessor, the Progress Party, the DPP focus more on immigration, {{while at the same time}} being more pragmatic on other topics. While overall considered part of the radical right, its policies on most economic issues would rather place the party in the centre to centre-left. The party's current leader, Kristian Thulesen Dahl, once declared DPP an anti-Muslim party.|$|E

40|$|Cultural traits play a {{significant}} role in the determination of economic outcomes and institutions. This paper presents evidence from laboratory experiments on the cultural integration of individuals of Chinese ethnicity in Australia, focusing on social preferences, preferences for competition, and risk attitudes. We show that the greater the share of education an individual receives in the West, the more they behave like Western subjects and the less they behave according to the norms of their Eastern heritage. Increased exposure to Western education has a strong negative impact on altruism, trust, and trustworthiness. For risk and competitive preferences, our results are gender-specific. These results have important implications for policy making and institution building in <b>multi-cultural</b> <b>societies...</b>|$|R

The paper describes shifts in religious and secular practices in dealing with loss and grief, presents case studies of traditional and contemporary frameworks in which ritual, storytelling and space are important elements of meaning making processes, and invites further examination {{of the ways in which}} artmaking restores a sense of control and meaning after the experience of loss. </div...|$|R

In this chapter, I explore {{the question of how}} young people understand and define their social positions, and how much the process is influenced by the societies they live in. I use material from a qualitative research project in one German and one Canadian secondary school. Young people with and without migrant backgrounds shared their experiences and analyses with me, discussing issues of belonging on a number of levels. Drawing on some of these discussions, I seek to show if and how structural differences on the nation-state level materialise in the way participants reproduce different discourses on “national” belonging. Statements of the Canadian participants are central here, and complemented by the comparative perspective of their German counterparts...|$|R

It reports that most New Zealanders from all ethnic groups (defined by self-identity) live in mixed rather than exclusive residential areas.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of wearing the hijab, or Islamic headwear, on men's perceptions of women's attractiveness and intelligence. A total of 57 non-Muslim men and 41 Muslim men rated a series of images of women, half of whom were unveiled and half of whom wore the hijab. For attractiveness and intelligence ratings, a mixed analysis of variance showed a significant effect of hijab status, with women wearing the hijab being rated more negatively than unveiled women. For attractiveness ratings, there was no significant effect of participant religion, although non-Muslim men rated unveiled women significantly higher than veiled women. For intelligence ratings, non-Muslim men provided significantly higher ratings than Muslim men for both conditions. In addition, Muslim men's ratings of the attractiveness and intelligence of women wearing the hijab was positively correlated with self-reported religiosity. These results are discussed in relation to religious stereotyping within increasingly <b>multi-cultural</b> <b>societies...</b>|$|R
