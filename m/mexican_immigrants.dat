5|$|Approximately 89.5 {{percent of}} {{residents}} {{over the age}} of five spoke English at home, according to the 2007–2011 American Community Survey. It was then estimated that 889 people, comprising 18.5 percent of local inhabitants have German ancestrythe largest ethnicity in Omakand 15.3 percent have Irish ancestry. The Omak area has a relatively high percentage of people of American Indian and Mexican ancestries; there were over 80 American Indians and over 535 <b>Mexican</b> <b>immigrants,</b> with a combined percentage of 28 percent of residents. Conversely, the city has a small Asian population, making up {{less than one percent of}} Omakians. The 2010 census showed that approximately 35 percent of residents lived alone, most of whom were female. Those {{over the age of}} 65 comprised about 16 percent of the population.

40|$|<b>Mexican</b> <b>immigrant</b> {{women are}} a {{vulnerable}} population {{group in the}} U. S., and face challenges {{as a result of}} the nation’s anti-immigrant landscape. To help <b>Mexican</b> <b>immigrant</b> women cope with these realities, scholars have proposed the implementation of social support interventions. Yet only two studies have executed social support interventions for immigrant women. Those tailored specifically for <b>Mexican</b> <b>immigrant</b> women are nonexistent. To address this gap, this Master's thesis piloted the first social support intervention for <b>Mexican</b> <b>immigrant</b> women in the U. S. The purpose was to assess the impact of a social support intervention on the perceived social support for <b>Mexican</b> <b>immigrant</b> women. The study (1) surveyed <b>Mexican</b> <b>immigrant</b> women's current perceived social support, (2) investigated whether engaging in a social support intervention could improve <b>Mexican</b> <b>immigrant</b> women's perceived social support, and (3) explored (through the use of a foto novela) the elements (e. g., persons, places) <b>Mexican</b> <b>immigrant</b> women consider to be most important sources of social support in their lives. Surveys were administered pre- and post-intervention assessing perceived social support using three Likert-type scales. At pre-intervention, perceived social support was moderately high. A difference in perceived social support at post-intervention was observed, but without significance. This work adds to the small body of literature on social support interventions for <b>Mexican</b> <b>immigrant</b> women, and has important implications for future interventions and research. This work also documents the use of foto novelas – an innovative tool to engage with (and give a voice to) <b>Mexican</b> <b>immigrant</b> women. Future work should consider the use of foto novelas, as these amplify new understandings of social support, and capture (through the use of photographs) <b>Mexican</b> <b>immigrant</b> women’s own interpretation of social support...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{well-documented}} history of barriers to mental health services among the <b>Mexican</b> <b>immigrant</b> community in the United States. Some of these barriers include low socioeconomic status (SES), lack of insurance, limited English proficiency, fear of discrimination, lack of residency status, and certain cultural dissonance. Culture-specific conceptualizations of mental illness may act as an additional barrier to effective mental health treatment for this community. The purpose of this qualitative {{study was to investigate}} conceptualizations of mental health in the <b>Mexican</b> <b>immigrant</b> community in the United States. Careful consideration was taken to ensure that the research design was developed to respect and consider the participants’ culture and surrounding community. Eight individuals from the <b>Mexican</b> <b>immigrant</b> community were interviewed about their beliefs regarding the causes of mental illness, explanations of mental illness, experiences with treatment providers, and ideas about appropriate treatment.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to explore {{effective}} ways of reaching <b>Mexican</b> <b>immigrant</b> parents in developing emergent literacy skills in their preschool age children at home. The project addressed the key problem that little curriculum exists that is specifically designed to support <b>Mexican</b> <b>immigrant</b> parents in home literacy practices.

The first workshop provided parents {{with an understanding of}} the need for literacy interactions at home during the preschool years in light of kindergarten Common Core Standards and current literacy research. The subsequent workshops taught the process of dialogic reading and were supported with follow up coaching sessions. The project is significant because it provided a resource specifically for <b>Mexican</b> <b>immigrant</b> parents that involves them in their children???s literacy education.

40|$|Situated in a {{recently}} established <b>Mexican</b> <b>immigrant</b> community in Pennsylvania, this dissertation investigates naturally occurring interactions in homes and school to reveal how <b>Mexican</b> <b>immigrant</b> fathers 2 ̆ 7 participation shapes and {{is shaped by}} their young children 2 ̆ 7 s schooling. Drawing upon ethnographic and linguistic anthropological methods, I investigate participants 2 ̆ 7 communicative repertoires, or how they deploy language and literacy resources in Spanish and English to meet their educational goals. This research examines three critical issues. First, how <b>Mexican</b> <b>immigrant</b> fathers 2 ̆ 7 orient to models of fatherhood and married life from their upbringings in Mexico {{as well as their}} journey into family life in the US. Second, how participants 2 ̆ 7 semiotic resources travel, are recognized, and are built upon across home and school contexts. And third, how <b>Mexican</b> <b>immigrant</b> men 2 ̆ 7 s positioning as certain social types, by teachers in schools and immigration officials in the community, affect their children 2 ̆ 7 s schooling. The findings indicate that racialization of the category of Mexican men makes them visible as potential 2 ̆ 2 illegals 2 ̆ 2 and invisible as caring husbands and fathers. These data challenge the gender bargain that <b>Mexican</b> <b>immigrant</b> couples are assumed to maintain and highlight the traditional and innovative ways that fathers are engaged in childcare, parent involvement, and other tasks that are often considered 2 ̆ 2 women 2 ̆ 7 s work. 2 ̆ 2 My findings also highlight how Mexican adult males are oftentimes targeted for minor infractions under current immigration practices, which leads to family separations and educational challenges for their children, a younger generation of DREAMers and U.

In addition to contributing to theoretical and methodological insights regarding <b>Mexican</b> <b>immigrant</b> fathers and their children 2 ̆ 7 s schooling, this study illustrates how a communicative repertoires approach can reveal participants 2 ̆ 7 range of real-world languaging, parent involvement, and biliteracy practices.

Similarly, the proposed remedies are primarily social in nature with an emphasis being put on help from the community, the family, or a professional.
