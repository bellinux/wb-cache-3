Major versions of PHP are allowed to break backward-compatibility of code and therefore PHP 7 presented an opportunity for other improvements beyond phpng that require backward-compatibility breaks, including wider use of exceptions, reworking variable syntax to be more consistent and complete, and the deprecation or removal of various legacy features.|$|E
500|$|FreeBSD {{developers}} maintain {{at least}} two branches of simultaneous development. The -CURRENT branch always represents the [...] "bleeding edge" [...] of FreeBSD development. A -STABLE branch of FreeBSD is created for each <b>major</b> <b>version</b> <b>number,</b> from which -RELEASE are cut about once every 4–6 months. If a feature is sufficiently stable and mature it will likely be backported (MFC or Merge from CURRENT in FreeBSD developer slang) to the -STABLE branch.|$|E
