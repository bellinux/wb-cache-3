40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} a {{technological}} evaluation of wire electrode material and <b>machining</b> <b>technologies</b> {{for the production of}} fir tree slots by Wire-EDM to compete with the conventional broaching process. Meeting the high requirements on surface integrity and precision, new electrodes in combination with <b>machining</b> <b>technologies</b> have been developed in order to increase the productivity of this machining process. In particular three wire electrodes including a standard brass wire, a coated high-speed-cutting wire and a Ni-coated wire for zero contamination of Cu and Zn in combination with standard and specifically developed <b>machining</b> <b>technologies</b> for cutting Inconel 718 are presented. Evaluation criteria for the comparison are the demanding requirements on fir trees in turbine engine production like precision, surface roughness, minimization of white layer formation and contamination. Finally, an energy consumption analysis of the electrode/machining technology combination is shown. The analyzed processes show that Wire-EDM is a capable process for the fir tree slot production...|$|R

50|$|Although {{development}} of modern {{high speed steel}} began {{in the second half}} of the 19th century, there is documented evidence of steels produced earlier with similar content. These include hardened steels in China in 13th century BC, wootz steel manufactured in India around 350 BC and production of Damascus and Japanese layered steel blades in years 540 AD and 900 AD. High-speed properties of those steels would be mostly coincidental (as no <b>machining</b> <b>technology</b> that involved quantification of speeds and feeds existed at the time) and would be the result of local iron ores containing natural traces of tungsten or other favorable alloying components.|$|E
50|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to market violins with machine tuners but they have not been {{generally}} adopted, primarily because earlier designs required irreversible physical modification of the peg box, making violinists reluctant to fit them to classical instruments, and because they added weight at the scroll. Early examples included large geared pegs that required much larger holes and/or bracing bars and additional holes, and tuning machines resembling those on a double bass, with metal plates screwed to the sides of the pegbox. Recent advances in <b>machining</b> <b>technology</b> have allowed the creation of several types of internally geared pegs {{the same size as the}} usual wooden pegs, requiring no more modification than would be seen in any peg replacement.|$|E

When it senses overload condition, which semantically suggests a dull or broken tool, it commands a stop to the <b>machining.</b> <b>Technology</b> is available nowadays to send an alert to someone remotely (e.g., the sleeping owner, operator, or owner-operator) if desired, which can allow them to come intercede and get production going again, then leave once more.
