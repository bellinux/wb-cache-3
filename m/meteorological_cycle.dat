Rapid urbanization has a real impact on several natural processes like the <b>meteorological</b> <b>cycles.</b> So to reduce the side-effects of urban development, consistent and accurate data are required to define urban land cover and, especially, the vegetation surface. Indeed, the vegetation presents a particular interest because of its influence on components of the urban environment like temperature or air quality. Images with a very high spatial resolution allow to obtain more details.

40|$|International audienceSaturn's moons, Titan and Enceladus, {{are two of}} the Solar System's most enigmatic {{bodies and}} are prime targets for future space exploration. Titan {{provides}} an analogue for many processes relevant to the Earth, more generally to outer Solar System bodies, and a growing host of newly discovered icy exoplanets. Processes represented include: atmospheric dynamics, complex organic chemistry, <b>meteorological</b> <b>cycles</b> (with methane as a working fluid), astrobiology, surface liquids and lakes, geology, fluvial and aeolian erosion, and interactions with an external plasma environment. In addition, exploring Enceladus over multiple targeted flybys will give us a unique opportunity to further study the most active icy moon in our Solar System as revealed by Cassini and to analyse in situ its active plume with highly capable instrumentation addressing its complex chemistry and dynamics. Enceladus' plume likely represents the most accessible samples from an extra-terrestrial liquid water environment in the Solar system, which has far reaching implications for many areas of planetary and biological science. Titan with its massive atmosphere and Enceladus with its active plume are prime planetary objects in the Outer Solar System to perform in situ investigations. In the present paper, we describe the science goals and key measurements to be performed by a future exploration mission involving a Saturn-Titan orbiter and a Titan balloon, which was proposed to ESA in response to the call for definition of the science themes of the next Large-class mission in 2013. The mission scenario is built around three complementary science goals: (A) Titan as an Earth-like system; (B) Enceladus as an active cryovolcanic moon; and (C) Chemistry of Titan and Enceladus – clues for the origin of life. The proposed measurements would provide a step change in our understanding of planetary processes and evolution, with many orders of magnitude improvement in temporal, spatial, and chemical resolution over that which is possible with Cassini-Huygens. This mission concept builds upon the successes of Cassini-Huygens and takes advantage of previous mission heritage in both remote sensing and in-situ measurement technologies...|$|R
40|$|Soil creep is {{important}} as a process affecting landform development, as a factor influencing slope stability and as an element of land wastage. Pew definitive studies have {{been made of the}} process and work on variables controlling rates of soil creep is very limited. Therefore, in the present study it was decided to monitor creep with a number of devices over different lengths of time so that variability over space and time could be determined. This involved investigations on three distinct scales: those of the laboratory, the plot and the drainage basin. To measure rates of creep and to monitor probable controlling variables, new instruments were designed and established procedures were modified. All new instruments were validated and essential features at each stage of the work were replication and the measurement of local variability. After initial tests on experimental plots a drainage basin was selected and instrumented for the pilot study, in which both creep rates and a number of basin variables were investigated. The experimental. design for the main study was then constructed, using six main instruments: Anderson's Inclinometer, Anderson's Tubes, aluminium pillars, dowelling pillars, Young's Pits, and Cassidy's Tubes to monitor rates of creep on each of twenty measuring plots. The basin factors considered as probable controls were categorised, as:(a) external or meteorological(b) surface, including slope angle and vegetation(c) internal, comprising the main soil variables Annual rates of creep, shown to vary from' 0. 3 mm to 2. 4 mm, were correlated with eighteen major basin factors. The results of graphical and statistical analysis showed that rates of creep are controlled by a number of 'force' factors, chiefly soil moisture, field capacity and plasticity index, together with 'resistance' factors, particularly bulk density and a number of shear stress measures. The importance of moisture and its related variables was reinforced by principal component analysis and confirmed in a model produced by stepwise multiple regression. Laboratory experiments with soil troughs demonstrated the relationship between soil movement and <b>meteorological</b> <b>cycles.</b> The daily monitoring of creep for extended periods on an experimental plot allowed short terra movement to be assessed. Further developments indicated by these results include long term monitoring and the mapping of spatial variation of creep over a 'landscape' using the key variables identified...|$|R

40|$|Images from {{instruments}} on Cassini {{as well as}} from telescopes on {{the ground}} reveal the presence of sporadic small-scale cloud activity in the cold late-winter north polar of Saturn’s large moon Titan. These clouds lie underneath the previously discovered uniform polar cloud attributed to a quiescent ethane cloud at ~ 40 km and appear confined to the same latitudes as those of the largest known hydrocarbon lakes at the north pole of Titan. The physical properties of these clouds suggest that they are due to methane convection and condensation. Such convection has not been predicted for the cold winter pole, but can be caused by a process in many ways analogous to terrestrial lake-effect clouds. The lakes on Titan are a key connection between the surface and the <b>meteorological</b> <b>cycle.</b> ...|$|E
30|$|As {{the only}} {{significant}} source of energy, incident solar radiation (sunlight) at {{the surface of the}} earth governs climate and the <b>meteorological</b> <b>cycles</b> and is essential for life. It has a major effect on the diurnal and seasonal temperature variations as well as the productivity of both terrestrial and aquatic plants by providing energy for the assimilation of carbon by plant canopies (Zhu et al. 2008 b, Kambezidis et al. 2012). One of the most critical components affecting crop yield is the amount of solar radiation available to the plant, and the ability and efficiency with which biomass is produced (Russell et al. 1989; Murchie et al. 2009; Zhu et al. 2010). Indeed one of the cornerstones of crop productivity is the close relationship between intercepted radiation and biomass, which defines radiation use efficiency and maximum productivity (Monteith and Unsworth 1990; Murchie and Reynolds 2012). It is important for our understanding of crop productivity to incorporate spatial and temporal variation in light intensity. However, the reduction of quantum yield that results from the inactivation of photosynthesis during high light episodes (termed photoinhibition) is rarely considered in this context, despite evidence that it can significantly affect yield and fitness in crops and model plant species (Zhu et al. 2004; Frenkel et al. 2007; Raven 2011). This may be particularly relevant for rice growing regions in South and Southeast Asia, which are positioned close to the equator where radiation can reach very high levels between periods of cloud cover. Here, the average annual solar irradiation can exceed 1800 kWh/m 2, typical of the dry seasons in the tropics (data available at SolarGis.info). As an example, regions such as Central Luzon in the Philippines and Central and East Java in Indonesia can receive accumulative annual solar irradiation of more than 2200 kWh m− 2. In regions that are environmentally vulnerable, higher light intensities could result in damage to crops and a significant reduction in yield. Photoinhibition is usually considered as a short-term response to periods of high light although is affected by long-term responses to environmental conditions (acclimation). In order to place photoinhibition in context with agricultural productivity which occurs over longer time scales it would be beneficial to link it with long term weather data. In this short review we summarise the current evidence that high irradiance levels result in significant yield reductions in rice crops at the metabolic and canopy levels.|$|R
40|$|The 2008 Chaitén Volcano {{eruption}} {{began on}} 2 May 2008 with an explosive phase that injected {{large amounts of}} tephra into the atmosphere. During {{the first week of}} the eruption, volcanic ash clouds were transported for hundreds of kilometres over Argentina by the prevailing westerly winds. Tephra deposition extended to the Atlantic Ocean and severely affected the Argentinean Patagonia. Impacts included air and water quality degradation, disruption of ground transportation systems and cancellation of flights at airports more than 1, 500 km apart. We use the FALL 3 D tephra transport model coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting-Advanced Research Weather (WRF-ARW) meteorological model to simulate tephra fall from the 2 - 9 May 2008 eruptive period. Our hindcast results are in good agreement with satellite imagery and reproduce ground deposit observations. Key aspects of our analysis, not considered during syn-eruptive forecasts, are the re-initialization of each simulation with actualized <b>meteorological</b> forecast <b>cycles</b> and better constrained model inputs including column heights (inferred from reanalysis of GOES- 10 imagery and nearby atmospheric soundings) and granulometric data obtained from field campaigns. This study shows the potential of coupling WRF/ARW and FALL 3 D models for short-term forecast of volcanic ash clouds. Our results highlight that, in order to improve forecasting of ash cloud dispersion and tephra deposition, it is essential to implement an operational observation system to measure temporal variations of column height and granulometric characteristics of tephra particles in nearly real-time, at proximal as well as distal locations...|$|R

The model parameters are estimated by applying the least-squares method. The standard error of the parameters is determined while taking into account the serial correlation in the residuals. The decreasing trend im- plies to a certain extent an improvement in the air quality of the study area.

40|$|The largest {{moon in the}} Saturn system, Titan, has a dense {{atmosphere}} {{comparable to}} that of the Earth. Clouds ranging the atmosphere have been detected, and {{it has been suggested that}} there is a <b>meteorological</b> <b>cycle</b> with methane instead of water as the condensible. The major constituent of the atmosphere is nitrogen, but the abundance of methane, the second most important constituent, is a mystery, as it is expected to have a short geological lifetime of approximately 10 million years because of photodissociation in the upper atmosphere. No evidence for oceans or even lakes that could act as sources for the atmospheric methane have been detected. Suggestions concerning the solution have been made. Geological features on the surface have been suggested to be cryovolcanoes, whether active or not is still to be confirmed. Clustering of mid-latitude clouds have also been suggested to be an effect of cryovolcanoes. One way or another all existing models include outgassing of methane into the atmosphere. Following a model for volcanic eruption plume rise, simulations of methane outgassing on Titan have been made for vents situated on the ground. Different parameters, including the initial velocity, temperature and the radius of the vent, are simulated and lead to plumes rising a few kilometers into the atmosphere.

As part of the South American component of this initiative, we present flux estimates of water, salt, dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and plankton for the estuarine system of Paranaguá Bay, southern Brazil, based on the LOICZ modeling approach and local data obtained during the 1990 's. This system is strongly influenced by a seasonal <b>meteorological</b> <b>cycle,</b> represented by the rainy/summer and dry/winter periods. Semi-diurnal tides of up to the 2. 7 -m range {{are responsible for the}} short time-scale dynamics. The model indicated a potential water export to the adjacent coast of up to 7 x 10 (6) m³ d- 1 in the dry season, and 28 x 10 (6) m³ d- 1 during the rainy season. The system exhibits seasonal and spatial variations in DIP and DIN fluxes. "DIP amounted to + 2. 3 x 10 (6) mol P yr- 1 and "DIN to - 2. 7 x 10 (6) mol N yr- 1, suggesting that net production of phosphate and consumption of inorganic nitrogen predominate throughout in the system. Fluxes and therefore export of DIN and eespecially of DIP are higher in the rainy season. Stoichiometric estimates based on the C:N:P ratios of the reacting particulate organic matter (mangrove and plankton detritus) suggest that net denitrification predominates all over the bay, with values between - 24. 3 and - 10. 6 x 10 (6) mol N year- 1.

40|$|Space-time {{fluctuations}} of the Earth’s emitted Thermal Infrared (TIR) radiation observed from satellite from {{months to}} weeks before an earthquake {{are reported in}} several studies. Among the others, a Robust Satellite data analysis Technique (RST) was proposed (and applied to different satellite sensors in various geo-tectonic contexts) to discriminate anomalous signal transients possibly associated with earthquake occurrence from normal TIR signal fluctuations due to other possible causes (e. g. solar diurnal-annual <b>cycle,</b> <b>meteorological</b> conditions, changes in observational conditions, etc.). Variations in satellite view angle depending on satellite’s passages (for polar satellites) and atmospheric water vapour fluctuations were recognized {{in the past as}} the main factors affecting the residual signal variability reducing the overall Signal-to-Noise (S/N) ratio and the potential of the RST-based approach in identifying seismically related thermal anomalies. In this paper we focus on both factors for the first time, applying the RST approach to geostationary satellites (which guarantees stable view angles) and using Land Surface Temperature (LST) data products (which are less affected by atmospheric water vapour variability) instead of just TIR radiances at the sensor. The first results, obtained {{in the case of the}} Abruzzo earthquake (6 April 2009, MW∼ 6. 3) by analyzing 6 years of SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager on board the geostationary Meteosat Second Generation satellite) LST products provided by EUMETSAT, seem to confirm the major sensitivity of the proposed approach in detecting perturbations of the Earth’s thermal emission a few days before the main shock. The results achieved in terms of increased S/N ratio (in validation) and reduced “false alarms” rate (in confutation) are discussed comparing results obtained by applying RST to LST products with those achieved by applying an identical RST analysis (using the same MSG-SEVIRI 2005 - 2010 data-set) to the simple TIR radiances at the sensor...|$|R
40|$|In {{traditional}} rural societies, {{the relationships}} between the two partners are genuine community patterns. It is not good to mingle male authority with thefe male’s, just like {{it is not possible to}} reverse the roles. Each of them has clear-cutt asks on both inter-relational level and on the level of socio-economic activities within or outside the household. The (male or female) authority in point is brought to the foreground as early as the first contacts between the partners. The whole “courtship”, “proposal”, “dealing” with the bride’s father (moment often associated with engagement), wedding rituals, etc., show the division of authority between the two. The community and the Church are on man’s side. The male has authority on his family. Yet, the authority originates in the role of representing the family in front of the community, a role assumed by man. The woman has authority on household. Yet she has internal control only when the mother-in-law and generally female community “consider she is able” to respond to the needs and duties this authority supposes. In several regions in France, for instance, the young wife has to be an “apprentice” for a year by her mother-in-law or another woman, if the former is absent. Man’s authority is granted by civil and religious law, by family and community and especially by socio-professional structure of traditional society, by “male” and “female” professions. Male mortality (the man is the one who is exhausted, toils, sacrifices himself, dies first) entails respect finally leading to authority. The young man looking for a wife is not concerned if she can lead a cart or cope with field work (although they are not excluded). Most of the times, the “village rumours” inform him if the young woman is able to be a good housewife through a well built mental pattern. From another perspective, the relationship between man and woman are most of the times dominated by the relationship between them and their exploitation. Thus, the equation is enlarged to husband – wife – land. The new relationship is framed by a cosmic universe, by <b>meteorological</b> season <b>cycles.</b> It is a unique relationship. Individual (and family!) life is influenced by the slightest whim of weather and nature in general. There are two types of relationships between the spouses: 1. the case of those under their parent, relatives, customs watch, when the woman has an inferior status; 2. the case of those emancipated, “evading” the traditional, when the husband accepts woman’s “equality”. In the latter case, we can speak of a love union, where “happiness” is more present, the husband imposes less authority on his wife, where there is a consensus between the spouses and their relationship is based on tenderness and physical pleasure. ...|$|R

The summer maximum LSWTs of lakes from 25 °S to 35 °N show a linear decrease with increasing altitude; − 3. 76 ± 0. 17 °C km− 1 (inline image = 0. 95), marginally lower than the corresponding air temperature decrease with altitude − 4. 15 ± 0. 24 °C km− 1 (inline image = 0. 95). Lake altitude of tropical lakes account for 0. 78 – 0. 83 (inline image) of the variation in the March to June LSWT–air temperature differences, with differences decreasing by 1. 9 °C as the altitude increases from 500 to 1800 m above sea level (a. s. l.)

The peak in the spectral energy of the current velocity fluctuations associated with high-frequency internal waves follows the seasonal dynamics of stratification, described by the stability frequency N. A comparison between the nearshore current velocity measurements in the littoral zone with temperature measurements in the pelagic of Lake Constance revealed a strong coupling between the occurrence of high-frequency internal {{waves in the}} littoral zone and {{the passage of the}} basin-scale internal Kelvin wave with a period of about 4 d. The littoral zone of a lake, which is usually defined as the shallow area near the shore where light penetration is sufficient for the growth of plants, is an extremely dynamic habitat where the physical conditions are highly variable on diurnal and subdiurnal timescales. Surface waves and the daily <b>meteorological</b> <b>cycle</b> are the most obvious physical processes causing a high temporal variability in the current field and in the thermal regime, particularly in the shallow littoral zone with depths of about 1 m. Here, we present data from Lake Constance demonstrating that current velocities and temperature in the deeper littoral zone, down to a depth of about 20 m, also have a high temporal variability on timescales of minutes to hours, and that the amplitude of, e. g., temperature fluctuations can be significantly larger than those in the shallow littoral zone.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} on late Enlightenment poetics {{and the history}} of the biomedical sciences unfolds a lapsed possibility near the historical beginnings of the division of labor between literary and scientific representation. Against the pressure, then and now, to treat the culture of science as context or antithesis to literary production, I recover a countervailing epistemology that cast poetry as a privileged technique of empirical inquiry: a knowledgeable practice whose figurative work brought it closer to, not farther from, the physical nature of things. In his late life science, Morphology, Goethe mischievously re-signified "objectivity" to mean an observer's vulnerability to transformation by the objects under view: "every new object, well seen, opens up a new organ in us. " Such a gesture at once opens the scene of experiment to the agency of objects, and shifts biology's question from the life force within beings, to the metamorphic relations between them. From Wordsworth's call for a "science of the feelings," to Blake's for a "sweet Science," and Goethe's for a "tender Empiricism," my project argues for a series of late Enlightenment attempts to re-invent empiricist methodology - and to do so with the resources of verse and figure. These revisionary poetic sciences, I argue, challenged early biological and aesthetic protocols to countenance the mutual, material influence between the subjects and objects of experiment; to represent `bare' sensation as itself vulnerable to social and rhetorical transformation; and to position vulnerability - to impression, influence, and decay - as central, not inimical, to life. I show that writers from James Thomson and Erasmus Darwin to Percy Shelley retrieved Lucretius's classical materialism as a model for describing bodies (textual and animal) as porous assemblages, shaped by losses and incorporations of what is not self, and not immediately present. In Lucretius's De Rerum Natura, all things, decaying in time, scatter fine atomic husks from their bodies: simulacra, figurae, imagines. Here `figures' are fractions of the real estranged from their sources, and all bodies, not just poets or their language, produce them. Such an epistemology afforded poetry a strong claim upon the real, and proved particularly fit to connect the epochal interest in living bodies to the period's new sense of its own historicity. Poets deployed Lucretius's atomist imaginary in order to make historical experience palpable as what Wordsworth called an "atmosphere of sensation. " The material tropes they mobilized to do so, I argue, have been unrecognizable through the symbol-allegory paradigm that controls most rhetorical readings of romanticism. Such a view of the period's philosophy of life differs from a more frequent argument, whereby romantic poetics and early biology converge in the ideal of organism or artwork as self-sufficient whole, "both cause and effect of itself" - and the ideal of life or imagination as the "power" productive of such wholes. This Kantian and Coleridgean ideal of "organic form," I argue, has overshadowed our critical understanding of what the late Enlightenment poetics of life might have sought to do. Working through the tense collaboration between the Poet and the Man of Science in Wordsworth's 1800 "Preface" to Lyrical Ballads and in Blake's notion of "sweet Science" (The Four Zoas, 1797), my introduction extracts two critical lenses - "matter figures back," and "atmospheres of sensation" - with which to discern the rival epistemology described in the dissertation's four body chapters. In chapters that center on, and move outward from, Goethe's poetic biology (1 - 2) and Shelley's "poetry of life" (3 - 4) I show how a neglected strain of materialist natural curiosity sought to uncouple professionalizing biology and subject-centered aesthetics from their rhetoric of agency, autonomy, and power. In my first chapter, "Composite Life," I translate previously unavailable pieces from Goethe's microscopy logs (1785 - 6) and On Morphology periodicals (1817 - 24) as emblematic of the broader contemporary interest in studying living beings as composite, rather than organic forms. Here, each "seeming individual" is as a "being-complex," a fractious "assemblage of independent beings. " Morphology, moreover, redirects biological inquiry from the question of new life (generation) around which the discipline had coalesced, to the biology and poetics of decomposition and senescence - or, as Goethe names one essay, "Going to Dust, Vapor, Droplets. " What, this essay begins to ask, might life look like {{from the perspective of the}} non-reproductive, but communicative, effluvia that mediate between beings? What arts of discomposure would be adequate to this view? Focusing on an experiment in which a cut mushroom "draws" its own image in spores, I argue for the credibility in the period of non-human acts of representation: that is, for material (neo-Lucretian) images that emanate not just from agents, but from things. My second chapter, "Thinking Like an Object, Contra-Kant" concerns the aesthetic and poetic stakes of the experimental method Goethe calls "tender Empiricism," an approach to composite life that I read as a sly critique of Kant's durable accounts of aesthetics and organism. From Goethe's perspective, Kant's celebrated epistemological modesty - his concern that a man not "presumptuously [...] . tack a whim [...] . to the objects" (Goethe's paraphrase) - screens a more significant hubris: the presumption that a person could produce whims without objects and a sensing body; and, more basically, that what is important about a subject is the way in which he is not a natural object. Re- valuing the passive quality of tenderness as an epistemic virtue, Goethe experiments in "objectively active thinking," permitting the way the self is (also) an object to re-enter natural and aesthetic philosophy. The chapter culminates in a re-reading of the didactic poem Dauer im Wechsel ["Durance in Change"] from the perspective of objective figuration, centering on a neo-Lucretian simulacrum that, I argue, Paul de Man consequentially mistook for a symbol. In Chapter Three I move from Goethe's poetic morphology to Shelley's "poetry of life. " "Growing Old Together: Composite Physiognomy in The Triumph of Life" examines the way Shelley's Triumph revives Lucretian corporeality in order to rebuke the markedly triumphalist rhetoric of both contemporary vitalist physiology and post-Waterloo historiography. Offering a new account of the face-giving trope of prosopopeia in the poem, I argue that Shelley mobilizes Lucretian simulacra in order to think through the way personal bodies produce and integrate passages of historical time. Representing aging faces as mutable registers of the "living air" of a post-Napoleonic interval, The Triumph depicts senescence as the unintended work of multitudes, pressing towards a biology and epistemology of transience that holds rhetorical, vital, and historical materialisms together. In Chapter Four, "The Natural History of Violence: Atomist Pre-Histories for Shelley's The Mask of Anarchy," I continue the increasingly historical trajectory of the dissertation's materialism by turning to Shelley's poetic representation of the 1819 "Peterloo Massacre. " Here, I attempt to put the dissertation's valuation of epistemological "sweetness" and "tenderness" to the test of an event in which subjects' vulnerabilities were tragically violated. Focusing on the The Mask's preoccupation with the way wrongly spilled blood enters geological and <b>meteorological</b> <b>cycles,</b> I argue that the poem, which Shelley called "wholly political," is also a form of natural history. I recruit Erasmus Darwin, William Cowper, and James Thomson as well as Walter Benjamin to argue for a didactic natural historical mode in which a poem speaks polemically for bloodstained materials that do not, in themselves, disclose their provenance. In this way I suggest that, despite its reputation, pre-Darwinian natural history - and especially its poetry - is anything but a-historical or a-political. In the dissertation's Coda, "Marx's Sensuous Science" I pick up this materialist current at the start of the historical materialism more familiar to present-day critics: Karl Marx's doctoral {{dissertation on}} classical atomisms. I link Marx's reception of Lucretius to the idea of natural history that emerges in his "Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844," which paraphrase Goethe on tender empiricism, and argue (like Blake, Wordsworth, and Shelley) that any sensation-based science needs to countenance the senses' susceptibility to historical re-configuration. The Manuscripts strain, very much in the tradition my chapters lay out, towards what Marx calls a "sensuous science. " Like Goethe and Shelley, Marx presses past the biology of organicism in order to adumbrate "man's inorganic body," a body neither contemporaneous nor coincident with itself and whose life is traversed by and contingent upon innumerable others. In the Coda I take this cue to compare Marxian and neo-Lucretian ideology critique, asking how the embodied impressionability valued in "tender," "sweet," and "sensuous" sciences may run, but may also outrun, the risk Marx named "reification. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{worldwide}} modeling {{effort has}} been proposed by the LOICZ (Land-Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone) Program to foster the acquisition of intercomparable data on land-ocean fluxes in estuaries and continental shelf ecosystems from all continental margins. As part of the South American component of this initiative, we present flux estimates of water, salt, dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and plankton for the estuarine system of Paranaguá Bay, southern Brazil, based on the LOICZ modeling approach and local data obtained during the 1990 's. This system is strongly influenced by a seasonal <b>meteorological</b> <b>cycle,</b> represented by the rainy/summer and dry/winter periods. Semi-diurnal tides of up to the 2. 7 -m range {{are responsible for the}} short time-scale dynamics. The model indicated a potential water export to the adjacent coast of up to 7 x 10 (6) m³ d- 1 in the dry season, and 28 x 10 (6) m³ d- 1 during the rainy season. The system exhibits seasonal and spatial variations in DIP and DIN fluxes. "DIP amounted to + 2. 3 x 10 (6) mol P yr- 1 and "DIN to - 2. 7 x 10 (6) mol N yr- 1, suggesting that net production of phosphate and consumption of inorganic nitrogen predominate throughout in the system. Fluxes and therefore export of DIN and eespecially of DIP are higher in the rainy season. Stoichiometric estimates based on the C:N:P ratios of the reacting particulate organic matter (mangrove and plankton detritus) suggest that net denitrification predominates all over the bay, with values between - 24. 3 and - 10. 6 x 10 (6) mol N year- 1. Estimated seaward outflows had little effect upon the fate of the phyto- and zooplankton biomass in different sectors of the bay. This is exemplified by the low net export of algal production from the upper to the middle sectors of the estuary. Um esforço global de modelagem foi proposto pelo Programa LOICZ (Land-Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone) para promover a aquisição de dados comparáveis sobre fluxos continente-oceano em ecossistemas estuarinos e de plataforma em todos os continentes. Como parte do componente sulamericano desta iniciativa, apresentamos neste trabalho estimativas de fluxo de água, sal, fósforo inorgânico dissolvido (DIP), nitrogênio inorgânico dissolvido (DIN) e plâncton para o sistema estuarino da Baía de Paranaguá, obtidas a partir da aplicação de modelos sugeridos pelo programa LOICZ. Este sistema é fortemente influenciado por um ciclo meteorológico sazonal, representado pelos períodos chuvosos de verão e secos de inverno. As marés semidiurnas, com variação de até 2, 7 m, são responsáveis pela dinâmica estuarina de curta escala temporal. Nossos resultados indicam uma exportação potencial de água para a área costeira adjacente de até 7 x 10 (6) m³ d- 1 no período seco e mais de 28 x 10 (6) m³ d- 1 no período chuvoso. O sistema exibe variações sazonais e espaciais nos fluxos de DIP e DIN. O "DIP atingiu + 2. 3 x 10 (6) mol P ano- 1 e o "DIN to - 2. 7 x 10 (6) mol N ano- 1, sugerindo que a produção líquida de fosfato e o consumo de nitrogênio inorgânico predominam em todo o sistema. Os fluxos e, portanto, a exportação de DIN e principalmente de DIP são altos no período chuvoso. Estimativas estequiométricas baseadas nas razões C:N:P da matéria orgânica particulada reativa (detritos de origem planctônica e do manguezal) sugerem que o processo de denitrificação predomina em toda a baía, com valores entre - 24. 3 e - 10. 6 x 10 (6) mol N ano- 1. Os fluxos estimados em direção à área costeira adjacente tiveram pouco efeito sobre o destino da biomassa do fito- e zooplâncton nos diferentes setores da baía...|$|E
