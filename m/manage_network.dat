50|$|Software-defined {{networking}} (SDN) {{technology is}} {{an approach to}} computer networking that allows network administrators to programmatically initialize, control, change, and <b>manage</b> <b>network</b> behavior dynamically via open interfaces and abstraction of lower-level functionality. SDN is meant to address {{the fact that the}} static architecture of traditional networks doesn't support the dynamic, scalable computing and storage needs of more modern computing environments such as data centers. This is done by decoupling or disassociating the system that makes decisions about where traffic is sent (the SDN controller, or control plane) from the underlying systems that forward traffic to the selected destination (the data plane).|$|E
