The weather on D-Day was far from ideal, but postponing would have meant a delay {{of at least two}} weeks, as the invasion planners had requirements for the phase of the moon, the tides, and the time of day that meant only a few days in each month were deemed suitable. Adolf Hitler placed German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in command of German forces and of developing fortifications along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an Allied invasion.|$|E

50|$|Friedan {{continued}} {{to develop a}} strategy, months in advance, despite the negative reception.

The meeting produced nothing tangible or relevant. As the plans progressed, so did the controversy. In the final <b>month</b> <b>leading</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the event, the group was significantly divided into two factions: the young “radical, crazies” and the “bourgeoisie” founders.|$|R
