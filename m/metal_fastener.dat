50|$|Magnetic stud {{detectors}} use magnets {{to locate}} metal in the walling material because the magnet is {{attracted to the}} metal. The attraction grows stronger as the magnet gets closer to the metal in the walling. The strongest attraction point, if due to a <b>metal</b> <b>fastener</b> in the wall, should indicate {{the location of a}} stud, but careless wall construction can leave many metal fasteners off the studs or towards the edge, rendering the spot useless for anchoring objects. Magnetic stud detectors come in two types: stationary and moving.|$|E

5000|$|Moving magnet stud {{detectors}} use {{a neodymium magnet}} that {{is suspended}} in an enclosure and free to move in response to hidden metal. The strength of this rare earth magnet and the easy movement of the magnet allow moving magnetic stud detectors {{to work on a}} broad range of construction types. The magnet is suspended {{in such a way that}} it always sits in its [...] "home" [...] position until it is moved directly over a <b>metal</b> <b>fastener</b> or metal stud. On walls with shallow fasteners, the magnet moves towards the wall with such velocity that it makes a distinct thud sound when it hits the wall. Because a moving magnet is not dependent on the operator to feel the attraction to the metal, fasteners buried more deeply under plaster or tile can be located with this detector. For deeper fasteners, the sound is softer since the speed of movement is slower.|$|E
50|$|Stewart went {{to spring}} {{training}} with the Dodgers in 1981. Because {{he was out of}} options, the Dodgers could not send him back down to the minors without risk of losing him to another team. They had decided to release him, but reversed their minds and cut Don Stanhouse instead. He made the Dodgers opening day roster and pitched in relief that season, appearing in 32 games with a 2.49 ERA and six saves. He got his first Major League win in his first appearance of the season, on April 13 against the San Francisco Giants, when he worked two scoreless innings in relief of Bob Welch. His first save was recorded on August 16 against the Atlanta Braves. When the baseball players went on strike on June 12, Stewart was hard pressed financially and went to work for a Dodger fan that owned a <b>metal</b> <b>fastener</b> business and worked out with a semi-pro team along with teammate Bobby Castillo. The Dodgers made the playoffs that season and Stewart saw his first taste of post-season action, being credited as the losing pitcher {{in the first two games}} of the Division Series against the Houston Astros. He allowed a walk-off homer to Alan Ashby in game one and allowing the winning runs to reach base in the eleventh inning of game two. He redeemed himself by not allowing a run in the two games he appeared in for the Dodgers in the 1981 World Series against the New York Yankees, which the Dodgers won in six games.|$|E

40|$|Predicting the {{mechanical}} behaviour {{and the failure}} mechanism of timber joints with dowel-type fasteners requires consideration of several factors, including the geometrical and mechanical properties of the <b>metal</b> <b>fastener,</b> the physical properties of timber and the interaction between such elements. This paper proposes a numerical model where a joint is schematized as an elasto-plastic beam in a non-linear medium with a compression-only behaviour. Unlike the differential approach adopted {{by most of the}} hysteresis models published in literature, this model predicts the load-displacement response using simple mechanical relationships and basic input parameters. Furthermore, the model is capable of reproducing the effect of the cavity formed around the fastener by timber crushing, and simulates the hysteretic behaviour and the energy dissipation under cyclic conditions. Shear tests are reproduced on nailed steel-to-timber joints in Cross-Laminated Timber and results are compared to the experimental test data obtained on similar single fastener joints. Simulations lead to accurate predictions of both {{the mechanical}} behaviour (initial stiffness, maximum load-carrying capacity, global shape of the loading curve and of the hysteresis cycles) and the total energy dissipation observed in the tests...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{biodegradable}} screws and plates have received wide acceptance over metallic fasteners for orthopedic fracture fixation. A biodegradable fastener would gradually "disappear" during healing of a fractured bone or tissues, therefore avoiding a secondary operation to remove that fastener. When using a <b>metal</b> <b>fastener,</b> the current approach requires manual threading {{on a large}} bone fragment for fixation. This technique is difficult when it is required to fixate a small bone fragment. This study puts forth {{the development of a}} threadless, polymer based orthopedic fastener for small fragment fixation which would provide stability and interfragmental compression to the fracture site. The fastener was designed with ratchets on its surface, which deflect during insertion into the drilled hole in the bone and subsequently stiffen to hold the bone fragments in place due to interference. The head of the fastener was developed analogous to a Belleville washer which deflects during insertion of the fastener and subjects the bone fragments to interfragmental compression. Finite element analysis (FEA) was conducted to design the fastener profile and assess its performance. The push-in and pull-out forces predicted by FEA were comparable to the experimental results for the prototype of the microfasteners. The push-in force was found to increase with increasing insertion depth and radial interference. The force required to initiate pull-out was maximum and was reduced with reducing fastener bone contact. An analytical model was proposed to explain the fastener bone interaction. It was found to be in good agreement with the FEA and experimental results at low levels of interference...|$|E
40|$|Damages during extreme wind events {{highlight}} {{the weaknesses of}} mechanical fasteners at the roof-to-wall connections in residential timber frame buildings. The allowable capacity of the metal fasteners is based on results of unidirectional component testing that do not simulate realistic tri-axial aerodynamic loading effects. The first objective {{of this research was}} to simulate hurricane effects and study hurricane-structure interaction at full-scale, facilitating better understanding of the combined impacts of wind, rain, and debris on inter-component connections at spatial and temporal scales. The second objective was to evaluate the performance of a non-intrusive roof-to-wall connection system using fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) materials and compare its load capacity to the capacity of an existing <b>metal</b> <b>fastener</b> under simulated aerodynamic loads. ^ The Wall of Wind (WoW) testing performed using FRP connections on a one-story gable-roof timber structure instrumented with a variety of sensors, was used to create a database on aerodynamic and aero-hydrodynamic loading on roof-to-wall connections tested under several parameters: angles of attack, wind-turbulence content, internal pressure conditions, with and without effects of rain. Based on the aerodynamic loading results obtained from WoW tests, sets of three force components (tri-axial mean loads) were combined into a series of resultant mean forces, which were used to test the FRP and metal connections in the structures laboratory up to failure. A new component testing system and test protocol were developed for testing fasteners under simulated triaxial loading as opposed to uni-axial loading. The tri-axial and uni-axial test results were compared for hurricane clips. Also, comparison was made between tri-axial load capacity of FRP and metal connections. ^ The research findings demonstrate that the FRP connection is a viable option for use in timber roof-to-wall connection system. Findings also confirm that current testing methods of mechanical fasteners tend to overestimate the actual load capacities of a connector. Additionally, the research also contributes to the development a new testing protocol for fasteners using tri-axial simultaneous loads based on the aerodynamic database obtained from the WoW testing. ...|$|E
