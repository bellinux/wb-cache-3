40|$|Electrical and {{mechanical}} properties of PA 11 blended with nanographene platelets using industrial twin-screw extruder for {{selective laser sintering}} S Gaikwad 1, JS Tate 1, N Theodoropoulou 1 and JH Koo 2 The broader goal {{of this research is}} to develop a commercially viable material system and manufacturing method to mass produce functional parts using selective laser sintering, a rapid manufacturing method, for electrostatic charge dissipation applications. The specific objective of this research is to produce and characterize polyamide 11 / nanographene platelets nanocomposites that have improved electrical conductivity for electrostatic charge dissipation applications and better thermal stability to be used in selective laser sintering manufacturing. Polyamide 11 and nanographene platelets were blended using industry size co-rotating twin-screw extrusion. Four batches were prepared containing 1 wt%, 3 wt%, 5 wt % and 7 wt % of nanographene platelets. Microsctrucre of nanocompoistes was studied using scanning electron microscopy. Thermal characterization of nanocomposites was conducted using thermogravimetric analysis at three heating rates 5, 20, 40 C/min. Electrical resistivity was measured using the Hioki <b>Megaohmmeter</b> Instrument four probe method. Mechanical characterization includes tensile, flexure, and Izod-impact properties. Flammability property was measured using UL 94 test...|$|E
