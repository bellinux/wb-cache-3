5|$|For {{mourning}} activities, {{the flag}} can be flown {{in either of}} the following ways. The first method, commonly known as half-staffing, is performed when the flag is hoisted {{to the top of}} the flagpole, then lowered to the pole's one-third position. The other <b>method</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> attach a black ribbon to a flag that is permanently affixed to a staff. The ribbon itself is ten centimetres wide and it is attached to the mast so that the ends of the ribbon reach the bottom of the flag. During a funeral ceremony, the flag may be used to cover the coffins of government officials, soldiers, signatories of the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania, and persons designated by an act of the President; these flags are later folded and presented to the next of kin before interment.|$|E
5|$|One <b>method</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use {{the ground}} as a heat sink by drawing air through {{underground}} pipes. This is often done to provide a source of cool air for a building {{by means of a}} ground-coupled heat exchanger (also known as Earth tubes), wherein condensation is typically regarded as a significant problem. A major problem with such designs is that the underground tubes are subject to contamination and difficult to keep clean. Designs of this type require air to be drawn through the pipes by a fan, but the power required may be provided (or supplemented) by a wind turbine.|$|E
5|$|Pistorius {{is always}} slow in {{starting}} a race because the flexible blades {{do not provide}} thrust out of the blocks. Pistorius must begin from an awkward position, swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running, when the preferred <b>method</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> push off with horizontal force. For the first 30 meters of a race, he keeps {{his head down and}} takes short, quick strides. As he establishes a rhythm, he can raise his head and increase his speed. While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy forward, looking somewhat like he is rolling on wheels. He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on the turns, breaking the curves into short, straight lines. According to his coach Ampie Louw, Pistorius may {{be able to use the}} inward lean to generate force and come out of a turn going faster.|$|E

5|$|Southeast Asian {{traditional}} beliefs, as well {{as traditional}} Chinese medicine, consider the durian fruit to have warming properties liable to cause excessive sweating. The traditional method to counteract this is to pour water into the empty shell of the fruit after the pulp has been consumed and drink it. An alternative <b>method</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> eat the durian in accompaniment with mangosteen, which is considered to have cooling properties. Pregnant women or people {{with high blood pressure}} are traditionally advised not to consume durian.|$|E
5|$|The book's general <b>method</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{present a}} wide range of {{examples}} from across the animal kingdom of each type of coloration, including marine invertebrates and fishes as well as terrestrial insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. The examples are supported by a large number of Cott's own drawings, diagrams, and photographs. This essentially descriptive natural history treatment is supplemented with accounts of experiments by Cott and others. The book had few precedents, but to some extent follows (and criticises) Abbott Handerson Thayer's 1909 Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} {{methods for}} different isotopes vary, and only those for promethium-147 are given {{because it is}} the only isotope with industrial applications. Promethium-147 is produced in large quantities (compared to other isotopes) by bombarding uranium-235 with thermal neutrons. The output is relatively high, at 2.6% of the total product. Another way to produce promethium-147 is via neodymium-147, which decays to promethium-147 with a short half-life. Neodymium-147 can be obtained either by bombarding enriched neodymium-146 with thermal neutrons or by bombarding a uranium carbide target with energetic protons in a particle accelerator. Another <b>method</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> bombard uranium-238 with fast neutrons to cause fast fission, which, among multiple reaction products, creates promethium-147.|$|E

40|$|A <b>method</b> <b>is</b> given <b>to</b> {{compute the}} {{spurious}} endpoint {{contributions in the}} physical optics solution for electromagnetic scattering from conducting bodies. The <b>method</b> <b>is</b> applicable <b>to</b> general three-dimensional structures. The only information required <b>to</b> use the <b>method</b> <b>is</b> the radius of curvature of the body at the shadow boundary. Thus, the <b>method</b> <b>is</b> very efficient for numerical computations. As an illustration, the <b>method</b> <b>is</b> applied <b>to</b> several bodies of revolution to compute the endpoint contributions for backscattering {{in the case of}} axial incidence. It is shown that in high-frequency situations, the endpoint contributions obtained using the <b>method</b> <b>are</b> equal <b>to</b> the true endpoint contributions...|$|R

5|$|To make {{brominated}} polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can {{be incorporated}} into the polymer during polymerisation. One <b>method</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process. For example, vinyl bromide can be used in the production of polyethylene, polyvinylchloride or polypropylene. Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process For example, tetrabromobisphenol A can be added to polyesters or epoxy resins, where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxys used in printed circuit boards are normally made from such flame retardant resins, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products (FR-4 and FR-2). In some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after polymerisation. For example, decabromodiphenyl ether can be added to the final polymers.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>method</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use the {{aberration}} of light, {{discovered and}} explained by James Bradley in the 18th century. This effect {{results from the}} vector addition of the velocity of light arriving from a distant source (such as a star) and the velocity of its observer (see diagram on the right). A moving observer thus sees the light coming from a slightly different direction and consequently sees the source at a position shifted from its original position. Since {{the direction of the}} Earth's velocity changes continuously as the Earth orbits the Sun, this effect causes the apparent position of stars to move around. From the angular difference in the position of stars (maximally 20.5 arcseconds) it is possible to express the speed of light in terms of the Earth's velocity around the Sun, which with the known length of a year can be converted to the time needed to travel from the Sun to the Earth. In 1729, Bradley used this method to derive that light travelled 10,210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8minutes 12seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the experimental {{study on the}} reduction of energy utilisation and thereby abiding an indirect control on the emission strategies for a CI engine. Three different methods for the control of emission were carried out {{and the results were}} compared.

The second <b>method</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> use coconut oil directly as an additive to diesel. The last <b>method</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> preheat the coconut oil blended diesel. The analysis showed that of all the coconut blends, namely, 10 % to 50 %, 20 % blended ratio found a good place in both fuel efficiency and reduced emissions. Similarly, the preheated blends showed still drastic reductions in emissions even for higher proportions of coconut oil...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{consider}} {{directed path}} models of {{a selection of}} polymer and vesicle problems.

In particular, the Temperley <b>method</b> <b>is</b> used for the polymer collapse problem. The ZL <b>method</b> <b>is</b> used <b>to</b> solve the semi-continuous vesicle model. The Constant Term <b>method</b> <b>is</b> used <b>to</b> solve a set of partial difference equations for the polymer adsorption problem. The Kernel <b>method</b> <b>is</b> used <b>to</b> solve the functional equation that arises in the polymer force problem. Finally, the Transfer Matrix <b>method</b> <b>is</b> used <b>to</b> solve a problem in colloid dispersions.
