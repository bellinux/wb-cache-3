METHODS AND RESULTS: In the PHARMO database, including among others drug-dispensing and hospital discharge records for more than two million subjects in the Netherlands, 59, 094 new users of statins in the period 1 January 1991 until 31 December 2004, >or= 18 years of age were identified. In these patients, exposure to statins, both <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of persistence and dose, was determined over the first two treatment years. To determine the risk for AMI, patients were followed from this 2 -year time point until the first hospital admission for AMI, death, or end of the study period.

40|$|Network-on-chip (NoC) {{has become}} a {{critical}} shared resource in the emerging Chip Multiprocessor (CMP) era. Most prior NoC designs have used {{the same type of}} router across the entire net-work. While this homogeneous network design eases the burden on a network designer, partitioning the resources equally among all routers across the network does not lead to optimal resource us-age, and hence, affects the performance-power envelope. In this work, we propose to apportion the resources in an NoC to leverage the non-uniformity in network resource demand. Our proposal in-cludes partitioning the network resources, specifically buffers and links, in an optimal manner. This approach results in redistributing resources such that routers that require more resources are allocated more buffers and wider links compared to routers demanding fewer resources. This results in a novel heterogeneous network, called HeteroNoC, which is composed of two types of routers – small power efficient routers, and big high performance routers. We eval-uate a number of heterogeneous network configurations, composed of big and small routers, and show that giving more resources to routers along the diagonals in a mesh network provides <b>maximum</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of performance and power. We also show the po-tential benefits of the HeteroNoC design by co-evaluating it with memory-controllers and configuring it with an asymmetric CMP consisting of heterogeneous cores...|$|R
40|$|Performance {{and power}} {{are the first}} order design metrics for Network-on-Chips (NoCs) that have become the de-facto {{standard}} in providing scalable communication backbones for multicores/CMPs. However, NoCs can be plagued by higher power consumption and degraded throughput if the network and router are not designed properly. Towards this end, this paper proposes a novel router architecture, where we tune the frequency of a router in response to network load to manage both performance and power. We propose three dy-namic frequency tuning techniques, FreqBoost, FreqThrtl and FreqTune, targeted at congestion and power management in NoCs. As enablers for these techniques, we exploit Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) and the imbalance in a generic router pipeline through time stealing. Experi-ments using synthetic workloads on a 8 x 8 wormhole-switched mesh interconnect show that FreqBoost is a better choice for reducing average latency (maximum 40 %) while, FreqThrtl provides the <b>maximum</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of power saving and energy delay product (EDP). The FreqTune scheme is a bet-ter candidate for optimizing both performance and power, achieving on an average 36 % reduction in latency, 13 % sav-ings in power (up to 24 % at high load), and 40 % savings (up to 70 % at high load) in EDP. With application bench-marks, we observe IPC improvement up to 23 % using our design. The performance and power benefits also scale for larger NoCs...|$|R

Contrary to most other studies a generic Casing Treatment was designed to provide optimal optical access in the immediate vicinity of the CT, rather than for <b>maximum</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of stall margin extension. The second part of this two-part paper deals with the numerical developments, and their validation, carried out in order to efficiently perform time-accurate casing-treatment simulations. The numerical developments focus on the extension of an existing coupling algorithm in order to carry out unsteady calculations with any exterior geometry coupled to the main flow passage (in this case a single slot) having an arbitrary pitch. This extension is done by incorporating frequency domain, phase-lagged boundary conditions into this coupling procedure. Whereas the phaselag approach itself is well established and validated for standard rotor-stator calculations, its application to casing treatment simulations is new. Its capabilities and validation will be demonstrated on the given compressor configuration, making extensive use of the detailed PIV flowfield measurements near the rotor tip. Instantaneous data at all measurement planes will be compared for different rotor positions with respect to the stationary slots in order to evaluate the time-dependent interaction between the rotor and the casing treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{concepts}} of organizational crisis, change leadership and culture {{have continued to}} intrigue and excite academics as well as industry professionals for several decades. Researches in these disciplines have {{tended to focus on}} their impacts on upper echelons of the organizational hierarchies. This multi-phenomena qualitative case study sought to examine the relationships which exist between crisis, organisational culture and change leadership and their impact on middle to lower levels of organizational leadership. The paper proposes a conceptual framework which was developed on the back of an extensive literature review. The central premise is crisis by its very nature could potentially create a sense of urgency and ultimately serve as a conduit to spur change leadership initiatives and an effective change leadership can directly impact the creation of a desired Organisation culture. As a bottom up exploration of change leadership, the paper seeks to imbue in the psyche of lower to middle level managers that they have the opportunity to create culture with any crisis they could potentially face in their roles. The crisis creates a golden chance for them to expatiate on the change agenda to their direct reports and hopefully lead to a better team culture.

40|$|In a {{developing}} country like India where 73 {{percentage of the population}} lives in rural areas and only 27 percentage in urban areas, we need a very structured planning procedure should be used for the development activities and infrastructure facilities available in rural area. Rural roads are integral part of rural development and it stimulates overall development by providing access to economic and social infrastructure and facilities. In order to avoid the problems associated with rural road development, it is advisable to prepare a rural road plan by building strong database, which consists of village level information and road inventory details. GIS supports multiple views of data and yet provide integration that would minimize redundancy and maintain data integrity and security. It allows concurrent access to multiple users and processing of user transactions in an efficient manner.

It used the model to identify five phases of success from localised applications of ICT through to the high-level integration of ICT across all institu-tional processes. This model could be used to describe <b>in</b> broad <b>terms</b> what progress the institution has made in a variety of areas: in relation to ICT system integration; with reference to the application of technology to teaching and learning; <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of customer focus; and in relation to supporting organisational integration.

40|$|Purpose. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine the optimum way of recovering energy from the biodegradable fractions of municipal waste. A part-life cycle study was carried out on the following wastes; paper, food waste, garden waste, wood, non-recyclable mixed municipal waste and refuse derived fuel. The energy recovery processes considered were incineration, gasification, combustion in dedicated plant, anaerobic digestion and combustion in a cement kiln. Methods. The LCA was carried out using WRATE, an LCA tool designed specifically for waste management studies. Additional information on waste composition, waste collection and the performance of the energy recovery processes was obtained from a number of UK-based sources. The results take account of the energy displaced by the waste to energy processes and also the benefits obtained by the associated recycling of digestates, metals and aggregates as appropriate. Results and discussion. For all the waste types considered the <b>maximum</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of climate change and non-renewable resource depletion would be achieved by using the waste in a cement kiln as a substitute fuel for coal.

This study has demonstrated that LCA can be used to determine the benefits and burdens associated with recovering energy from municipal waste fractions. However, the findings were restricted by the lack of reliable data on the performance of waste gasification and anaerobic digestion systems and on the burdens arising from collecting the wastes.

Two periscope light sheet probes were specifically designed for this application to allow for precise alignment of the laser light sheet at three different radial positions in the rotor passage (87. 5 %, 95 % and 99 %). For the outermost radial position the light sheet probe was placed behind the rotor and aligned to pass the light sheet through the blade tip clearance. It was demonstrated that the PIV technique is capable of providing velocity information of high quality even in the tip clearance region of the rotor blades.

This work examines the growth and yield responses of maize to inoculation with different species of rhizobia, isolated from the root nodules of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), lentil (Lens culinaris M.) and mung bean (Vigna radiata L.) in pots and fields. Twenty isolates of rhizobia were isolated from root nodules each of mung bean, lentil and chickpea and were screened under axenic conditions. On the basis of their promising performance under axenic conditions, nine most efficient isolates (three from each legume host) were selected, characterized and further evaluated for their growth promoting activities by conducting pot and field experiments. Results of pot experiment revealed that maximum increase in grain yield, 1000 grain weight, N, P and K uptake (up to 47. 89, 54. 52, 73. 46, 84. 66 and 59. 19 % by CRI 28, respectively, over un-inoculated control) was produced by the isolate of Mesorhizobium ciceri. Whereas, maximum improvement in rest of the parameters was caused by the isolates of Rhizobium phaseoli (i. e. fresh biomass, straw yield and root length up to 36. 30 % by A 18, 25. 46 % by S 6 and 81. 89 % by A 18, respectively over un-inoculated control). Rhizobium leguminosarum isolates came out to be the least effective among the species tested. Similarly, all the selected isolates improved the growth and yield attributing parameters in fields as well but with varying capacity compared with un-inoculated control. The selected isolates of Mesorhizobium ciceri and Rhizobium phaseoli again remained superior compared to the isolates of Rhizobium leguminosarum under field conditions. The results of this study imply that rhizobium species had potential to promote growth and yield of maize but this technology should be employed after appropriate site specific investigations of particular rhizobial specie with respect to specific non-leguminous crop variety to get <b>maximum</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of better growth and yield...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{iron and}} steel {{manufacturing}} sector {{is one of the}} largest sectors in the world <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of financial volume of trade, employment potential, development of ancillary and allied industries and geographical spread. Added to this is the fact that {{iron and steel}} is used as an input in almost all the industrial and manufacturing sectors and goods produced by them. As a result this sector attracts the maximum attention of almost all the countries of the world, whether being one of the manufacturers and suppliers or not. This is because the universality and increased percentage of usage has created conditions for present and future demand for this commodity, part of which is due to the beneficial results of opening up of the global economy due to the influence of WTO. This demand has created immense opportunities for steel manufacturing countries as well as global steel manufacturing countries, both of whom are charting out aggressive policies and strategies to gain the maximum advantage from this situation. As part of their strategies the global steel manufacturing companies are scouting for opportunities worldwide where they can set up their operations that would reap the <b>maximum</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of profit and market share. At the same time the steel manufacturing countries are also trying to attract the global steel companies to set up operations in their country by which they would benefit from increased business, production capacity and transfer of latest technology. In line with this environment it is found that India as a manufacturer of iron and steel is attracting the attention of global steel manufacturers, who have already made plans for setting up manufacturing units in the country, some of them like POSCO, Arcelor Mittalalready on the process of implementing their plans. The reasons behind the attractiveness of India as a destination for manufacture of iron and steel is the latent demand existing in the country, availability of huge quantities of iron ore, other raw materials and factors of production, its rich legacy as a premier centre for production of iron and steel and its geographical position from where global steel companies can reach out to other markets of the world. These reasons have been largely influenced by the general climate of optimism and global demand for steel. Along with all these reasons the proactive policy of the Government of India for the overall development of the steel industry has contributed to a large measure in instilling confidence amongst global steel companies and investors to invest and set up operations in this sector in India...|$|R

One could say that the circumstances for using these techniques are better now than ever. Some of the reasons for applying CHP and CHCP are: the techniques are well understood, their application could generate some profit, and the required technology is available. Moreover, there is increasing concern in regards to energy security, the need to increase the energy efficiency in power generation and distribution as well as to lower the emissions from fossil fuel combustion. CHP/CHCP promoters and developers face difficulties when analyzing the conditions and proposing a plan of application. On one hand, there are some external barriers which have to be torn down by means of energy regulation schemes. These may include economic incentives, easy and safe interconnection to the grid to export electricity and have backup if necessary, and access to the market to sell the surplus of electricity at a fair price. On the other hand, there are some internal barriers such as the difficulty evaluating potential energy savings, emission reduction, and economic performance of a project based on the circumstances of a specific site; lack of awareness; unwillingness to invest in CHP/CHCP projects; and difficulty in selecting and sizing the equipment which would give the <b>maximum</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of life cycle cost, energy savings and emission reduction. Nowadays, it is possible to develop software tools which use simulations and optimization algorithms to evaluate several options, compare them and chose the ones that give the optimum performance with respect to an objective function defined by the user. In this project, the general context for the application of cogeneration and tri-generation projects was studied including factors which have an impact on its feasibility and performance. Moreover, a survey of the exiting feasibility analysis tools was done, and a case study was chosen and analyzed. Next, a model was developed using the software Trnsys for the simulation and Matlab for the optimization. The model was tested by evaluating the study case. The result of the simulation and optimization gives several possible equipment size combinations. The tradeoff between two different objective functions such as net present value and primary energy savings or emission reduction is presented in Pareto front diagrams. The main conclusion of this project is that by using Trnsys and Matlab, it is possible to develop more complex models which, when applying optimization algorisms, could become a very useful and helpful tool that CHP/CHCP developers could use to speed up the analysis of projects while contributing to the goal of deploying these techniques...|$|R

40|$|Pointer {{analysis}} {{is one of}} the key static analyses during compilation. The efficiency of several compiler optimizations and transformations depends directly on the scalability and precision of the underlying pointer analysis. Recent advances still lack an efficient and scalable context-sensitive inclusion-based pointer analysis. In this work, we propose four novel techniques to improve the scalability of context-sensitive points-to analysis for C/C++ programs. First, we develop an efficient way of storing the approximate points-to information using a multi-dimensional bloom filter (multibloom). By making use of fast hash functions and exploiting the spatial locality of the points-to information, our multibloom-based points-to analysis offers significant savings in both analysis time and memory requirement. Since the representation never resets any bit in the multibloom, no points-to information is ever lost; and the {{analysis is}} sound, though approximate. This allows a client to trade off a minimal amount of precision but gain huge savings(two orders less) in memory requirement. By making use of multiple random and independent hash functions, the algorithm also achieves high precision and runs, on an average, 2 ×faster than Andersen’s points-to analysis. Using Mod/Ref analysis as a client, we illustrate that the precision is above 98 % of that of Andersen’s analysis. Second, we devise a sound randomized algorithm that processes a group of constraints in a less precise but efficient manner and the remaining constraints in a more precise manner. By randomly choosing different groups of constraints across different runs, the analysis results in different points-to information, each of which is guaranteed to be sound. By joining the results of a few runs, the analysis obtains an approximation that is very close to the one obtained by the more precise analysis and still proves efficient <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of the analysis time. We instantiate our technique to develop a randomized context-sensitive points-to analysis. By varying the level of randomization, a client of points-to analysis can trade off minimal precision (less than 5 %) for large gain in efficiency(over 50 % reduction in analysis time). We also develop an adaptive version of the randomized algorithm that carefully varies the randomization across different runs to achieve <b>maximum</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of analysis time and precision without pre-setting the randomization percentage and the number of runs. Third, we transform the points-to analysis problem into finding a solution to a system of linear equations. By making novel use of prime factorization, we illustrate how to transform complex points-to constraints into a set of linear equations and transform the solution back as a points-to solution. We prove that our algorithm is sound and show that our technique is 1. 8 ×faster than Andersen’s analysis for large benchmarks. Finally, we observe that the order in which points-to constraints are processed plays a vital role in the algorithm efficiency. We prove that finding an optimal ordering to compute the fixpoint solution is NP-Hard. We then propose a greedy heuristic based on the amount of points-to information computed by a constraint to prioritize the constraints. This results in a dynamic ordering of the constraint evaluation which, in turn, results in skewed evaluation of constraints where each constraint is evaluated repeatedly and different number of times in a single iteration. Our prioritized analysis achieves, on an average, an improvement of 33 % over Andersen’s points-to analysis. We illustrate that our algorithms help in scaling the state-of-the-art pointer analyses. We also believe that the techniques developed would be useful for other program analyses and transformations...|$|R
40|$|On the East Coast of South Africa, on {{the warm}} {{waters of the}} Indian Ocean, lie the shores of Coffee Bay town. This small {{predominantly}} rural beach town beams with multitude of tourism potential. The town prides itself for its magnificent beach, hotels, and tourism activities like: horse riding, hiking and boasts of other tourism facilities and attractions. Besides tourism potential this small town faces number of challenges. The majority of the town’s economically active population is illiterate, unemployed and lives under the poverty line. The town on its own is a pot of gold; however, the community {{needs to be more}} involved in the decision making for developments within the town, as well as encouraging of pride of citizenship. This would ensure <b>maximum</b> <b>benefit</b> for residents, <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of economic growth, access to opportunities, betterment of livelihoods, etc. In the pursuit of Tourism-led Local Economic Development (LED) oriented growth in Coffee Bay, the place making determinants becomes central in order to address the number of challenges faced by the local communities. Place making determinants and processes applicable to the area entails optimal use of resources that are unique to an area, for the economic (increased investment in the area, rise in tourists coming in, improved environments for fishing, establishment of a fully functional and beneficial fishing industry), social (improved well-being of local residents), community (infrastructure and livelihood within the town) and otherwise benefits. The paper discusses the place based tourism-led approaches in the context of rural communities and highlights the key determinants of place making process in a rural centric tourism-led local economic development. The research is based on mixed method approach (qualitative and quantitative) and brings out the discussion on: essence, self-sufficiency, sustainability and inclusion of communities based on locally available assets, potential and resources...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Economic {{evaluation}} {{attempts to}} weigh costs {{and effects of}} alternative interventions with the goal that available resources are used to achieve <b>maximum</b> <b>benefits</b> for patients <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of health and quality of life. In emerging technologies this is particularly important to avoid inappropriate and excessive use. Objectives To analyse evidence on economic evaluation in oral health care, particularly on diagnostic imaging methods, by systematic review. Material and methods A search for literature was made starting with a hand made search according to the pearl growing model. This search strategy means that articles and relevant literature are retrieved by talking to renowned specialists in the subject area and by finding indexing and MeSH terms by looking at those articles and their reference lists. From seven articles indexing terms and MeSH terms were chosen and searches were made from PubMed, the Cochrane Library and Science Citations Index. The retrieved primary studies that according to the abstract contained a cost-effectiveness analysis were interpreted by two reviewers using a check-list for assessing economic evaluations (Drummond et al. 2005). Results The literature search yielded 258 titles and abstracts. Out of these, 93 studies were selected and read in full text. There was a vast heterogeneity in study design. No clear evidence was found. Methodology regarding the odontological part was acceptable in a few studies but the methodology for the economic evaluation was insufficient. Conclusions and discussion This review reveals a need for studies with improved quality in economic evaluation in oral health care. We will propose and discuss a model for economic evaluation of diagnostic methods that will contain information of how to (i) identify costs (ii) categorise costs and (iii) value costs. This model will be applied in the SEDENTEXCT project on Cone Beam Computed Tomography. Reference: Drummond MF, Sculpher MJ, Torrance GW, O´Brian BJ, Stoddart GL.

40|$|Sustainability {{of water}} {{resources}} is imperative for the continued prosperity of Sri Lanka where the economy is dependent upon agriculture. The Mahaweli river is the longest in Sri Lanka, with the upper catchment covering an area of 3124 sq. km [...] The Mahaweli Development programme, a major undertaking in the upper catchment has been implemented with the aims of providing Mahaweli water to the dry zone of the country through a massive diversion scheme and also for generating hydropower. Under this programme, seven large reservoirs have been constructed across the river and large scale land use changes in the catchment have occurred {{during the last two}} decades. Critics now say that the hydrological regime has been adversely affected due to indiscriminate land use changes and, as a result, river flows have diminished during the last two decades, thus jeopardising the expectations of this massive development programme. Reforestation programmes have been recommended because of the <b>benefits</b> of forest <b>in</b> resource conservation and also the water derived from fog interception. Selection of the best sites for these forest plantations for <b>maximum</b> <b>benefits,</b> especially <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of water yield from fog interception has the utmost importance. This created the need for a comprehensive model to represent the hydrology and to simulate the hydrological dynamics of the catchment <b>In</b> conceptual <b>terms,</b> GIS is well suited for modelling with large and complex databases associated with hydrological parameters. However, hydrological modelling efforts in GIS are constrained by the limitations in the representation of time in its spatial data,structures. The SPANS GIS software used in this study provided the capability of linking spatially distributed numerical parameters with corresponding tabulated data through mathematical and statistical expressions while implicitly representing temporality through iterative procedures. The spatial distribution of land use was identified through the supervised classification of IRS-IA LISS II imagery. Daily rainfall data for a 30 year period and corresponding gauging locations derived from GPS were managed and retrieved through a Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 database. The fog interception component was estimated based on elevation and the monsoon season. Hydrological processes such as interception and evapotranspiration were derived from individual sub models and finally combined within the overall hydrological model structure. The model was run with daily time steps on numerical 'values of each quad cell of the thematic coverage. The information on flow derived from the model was depicted as a series of thematic maps in addition to the time series of numerical values at subcatchment and catchment outlets. The results confirmed that the model is capable of simulating catchment response of the UMCA successfully. The time dimension was accommodated through a senes of non-interactive REXX programmes in developing the customised version of the model. It is concluded that the software architecture of SPANS GIS is capable of accommodating spatiotemporal modelling implicitly in its spatial data structures although changes in the model structure may necessitate considerable reprogramming. Sensitivity of the model for different spatial interpolation techniques was evaluated. Further, sensitivity of the model for the defined hydrological parameters, spatial 'resolution and land use was also assessed. The model is sensitive to land use changes in the catchment and it shows 15 - 35 % annual increase of runoff when forests are converted to grassland. Further studies are required to develop a more detailed set of hydrological parameters for the model...|$|R
