5|$|Emmy passed within 135miles (215km) of the Lesser Antilles, {{though only}} <b>minor</b> <b>effects</b> were experienced. No damage was {{reported}} in the Azores, though strong winds from the hurricane caused a Venezuelan air force C-130 flight to crash near Lajes Field, killing all 68 aboard.|$|E
5|$|Alberto {{produced}} {{heavy rainfall}} in western Cuba, causing flash flooding and severe damage. The storm damaged 8,745houses and destroyed 154buildings, leaving hundreds homeless. Heavy rainfall {{continued in the}} country for several weeks after the storm, and damage from Alberto totaled about $85million (1982USD, $ USD). At least 23people were killed in the country. Initially, Alberto was forecast to continue northeastward and strike Florida, though it turned and rapidly weakened, resulting in <b>minor</b> <b>effects</b> in the state.|$|E

5|$|Grace {{had only}} <b>minor</b> <b>effects</b> on land, {{although}} {{while it was}} passing through the Azores, islands close to the storm's center recorded winds of up to 44mph (71km/h) and moderate rainfall. Although not solely related to the cyclone, heavy rainfall in Portugal led to some street flooding. The remnants also impacted parts of Ireland and the United Kingdom, where rainfall approaching 2 in (51mm) and tropical storm-force winds were recorded. However, no damage occurred.|$|E
5|$|Several {{tropical}} cyclones {{affected the}} state {{during the time}} period, though Hurricane Donna was the most severe. Paralleling the coastline offshore, the hurricane caused heavy damage near the coastline from high waves and winds. In addition, Hurricane Belle was predicted to strike the state, though it passed to the east with only <b>minor</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} produced {{heavy rainfall}} in southern Baja California, killing two rescue works from floodwaters. Resort areas near the coast experienced <b>minor</b> <b>effects,</b> though further inland {{the damage was}} more severe. The impact of Ignacio was compounded by flooding from Hurricane Marty a month later, with damage from the two hurricanes totaling about $1billion (2003USD, $1.1billion 2006USD).|$|E

5|$|As a {{tropical}} depression, the storm moved rapidly through the Lesser Antilles; consequently, most islands only experienced <b>minor</b> <b>effects.</b> For example, Saint Lucia received light and sporadic rain showers, accompanied by sustained winds of 20–25mph (32–40km/h) and gusts to 35mph (55km/h). In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, however, the depression dropped up to 9.2inches (235mm) {{of rain in}} 24hours. The rainfall blocked storm drains, including those near the airport, which was forced to shut down. The rainfall caused debris to collect on roads throughout the island. Although the storm passed just 70miles (110km) north of the Yucatán Peninsula, the storm dropped only 0.6inches (15mm) of rain due to its small size.|$|E
5|$|Cora was {{an unusual}} cyclone, {{maintaining}} an unusually low latitude for the Atlantic in August at high speeds, similar to the tracks of Tropical Storm Alma in 1974 and Tropical Storm Fran in 1990. The hurricane was also upgraded into a hurricane based solely on satellite photography, {{the second time this}} occurred. Although it passed through the Windward Islands and the Lesser Antilles, only <b>minor</b> <b>effects</b> were reported. Cora was also responsible for altering weather conditions allowing for a takeoff of the historical flight of the Double Eagle II hot air balloon.|$|E
5|$|Danny {{had only}} <b>minor</b> <b>effects</b> on land. However, it {{triggered}} high surf and rip currents from Florida through the Mid-Atlantic states, {{leading to the}} death of a 12-year-old boy in North Carolina. The cyclone's remnants contributed to widespread rainfall in the northeast United States. At one point, some weather forecasts predicted Danny to rapidly strengthen, and hit Nantucket as a Category 1 Hurricane, although this never occurred. Localized flooding was reported, particularly in Pennsylvania. It later caused heavy precipitation and power outages in Atlantic Canada.|$|E

50|$|A 1999 {{review in}} the Journal of Economic Literature stated that high {{inequality}} lowers growth, perhaps because it increases social and political instability; however, changes {{in the degree of}} inequality have a relatively <b>minor</b> <b>effect</b> on growth.|$|R
5|$|Flood waters {{from the}} Murchison River {{finally began to}} recede on 17 March; however, it took several weeks for the river to return to its normal level. Although Emma had only <b>minor</b> <b>effects</b> in Carnarvon, the town enacted a A$14million ($10million USD) flood {{protection}} plan {{in the wake of}} the storm. The plan would lead to the construction of new levees in areas surrounding the town and keep flood waters within Nicol Bay Flats. Additionally, four sections of the North West Coastal Highway were set to be upgraded for similar reasons. Due to the combined effects of Cyclones Clare, Darryl, Jim, Emma, Kate and Glenda, gold production in Australia fell by 8 percent, resulting in earnings losses of A$130million.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Fausto was {{a strong}} Category 1 {{hurricane}} that had only <b>minor</b> <b>effects</b> on land during its life over the eastern Pacific basin. The seventh tropical depression, sixth named storm, and third hurricane of the 2008 Pacific hurricane season, Fausto formed out of a tropical wave on July16. The storm gradually strengthened as it moved towards the west-northwest, becoming a minimal hurricane two days later. On July19, Fausto turned towards the northwest as it continued to strengthen. The next day, while passing between the Mexican islands of Clarion and Socorro, the hurricane reached its peak intensity with winds of 90mph (150km/h) and a minimum pressure of 977mbar (hPa; 28.85inHg).|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Storm Faxai, {{known in}} the Philippines as Tropical Storm Juaning, was a {{short-lived}} tropical storm that had <b>minor</b> <b>effects</b> on land. The twentieth named storm of the 2007 Pacific typhoon season, Faxai originated from a tropical depression over the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean in late October. The storm quickly strengthened, becoming a severe tropical storm on October26 as it rapidly traveled towards the northeast. The storm became extratropical the following day as it brushed Japan. The remnants dissipated on October28.|$|E

5|$|While Kate {{was moving}} through the Bahamas, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a {{hurricane}} warning from Jupiter to Fort Myers, Florida, including the Florida Keys. Then-Governor of Florida Bob Graham {{declared a state of}} emergency for six counties in South Florida. However, it was reversed following the relatively <b>minor</b> <b>effects</b> in the area. Officials recommended evacuation of the Florida Keys, leading to heavy traffic on the Overseas Highway and prompting the Red Cross to open 12shelters. Three shelters were opened in Key West, but only 500 individuals utilized them during the storm. Most residents chose to endure the storm in their homes. In Fort Lauderdale, schools were closed and residents of mobile homes were required to leave.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Barry was {{the fourth}} {{tropical}} depression, second hurricane and named storm of the inactive 1983 Atlantic hurricane season. Developing out of a tropical wave on August23, Barry quickly strengthened {{off the coast of}} Florida, reaching an initial peak intensity with winds of 60mph (95km/h). However, increased wind shear caused the storm to weaken to a tropical depression before making landfall near Melbourne, Florida, the next morning. Traveling almost due west, the storm regenerated and became a hurricane on August28. The storm made landfall on the northern Mexican coastline later that day at peak intensity. Rapid weakening followed shortly after and the storm dissipated the next day. The storm had only <b>minor</b> <b>effects</b> in the United States but destroyed hundreds of homes and left over 400 homeless in northern Mexico. Despite the damage, there were no reports of fatalities or injuries.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Beta reached Providencia Island, on October 29, 2005. Rainfall {{from the}} storm were {{estimated}} over 12in (304mm). Roofs were damaged all over the island, and the island's main communications tower was knocked over. A total of 1,660 homes were damaged by the storm throughout the island, leaving 1.4millionColombian peso (2005COP; $681USD) in repair costs. This disrupted fixed-line telephone service and as the island has no cellular telephone service, it caused a total cessation of communication with the mainland. Beta's arrival on the island {{was accompanied by a}} seven-foot storm surge, which damaged beaches, coastal houses and roads, and washed out a tourist footbridge. Coral reefs around the island were, for the most part, untouched, as only 1percent of the coral sustained minor damage. <b>Minor</b> <b>effects</b> were also found around areas of sea grass. Beaches all around the island lost an average of 9.8ft (3m) of sand due to erosion. Thirty people were injured and 913 families, a total of 3,074 people, were affected during Hurricane Beta's passage over the island.|$|E

30|$|For high GOR and {{low rate}} wells, {{the expert system}} could predict the best {{correlation}} 95 % of the cases. We can safely conclude that a ±  20 % error in GOR for those wells had <b>minor</b> <b>effect</b> in changing {{the order of the}} best correlation.|$|R
5|$|The major {{effect of}} the apolipoprotein A5 gene (and its variants) is on plasma {{triglyceride}} levels. Minor alleles (C1131 and Trp19) are primarily associated with the elevation of plasma triglyceride levels. The most extensive information available has been drawn from Caucasian populations, particularly {{in relation to the}} rs662799 SNP. Here, one minor allele is associated with an approximate 0,25mmol/L increase of plasma TG levels. A similar effect is associated with the Trp19 allele, even though it has not been confirmed by a huge number of studies. Original studies have further described that the strongest effect of APOA5 polymorphisms on plasma TG levels is observed among Hispanics, with only <b>minor</b> <b>effects</b> detected among Africans. Among Asians, the effect on plasma TG levels is similar that found among Caucasians. Generally, studies have suggested significant interethnic differences and in some cases sex-dependent associations as well.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Cyclone Urmil (RSMC Nadi designation: 06F, JTWC designation: 07P) {{was a short}} lived {{storm of}} January 2006 that explosively {{intensified}} to reach its peak intensity as a high-end Category 2 cyclone on the Australian Scale, just 12hours after being named. Forming out of a tropical disturbance early on January14, Urmil quickly intensified before weakening just as quickly. The intensification {{was a result of}} the main convective banding feature wrapping around the center of circulation. However, the combination of high wind shear and the rapid movement of the cyclone caused convection to become separated from the center. By January15, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone shortly before dissipating. Urmil had only <b>minor</b> <b>effects</b> on land; scattered vegetation damage was reported in Tonga.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Abby was an {{exceptionally}} small tropical cyclone that had <b>minor</b> <b>effects</b> across Southeast Texas in early August 1964. Forming as a tropical depression {{out of a}} trough south of Louisiana on August5, the system moved generally westward. It was not until August7 that the system began to organize. That day, an eye rapidly formed within the system {{and it became a}} tropical storm just 60mi (95km) southeast of Galveston, Texas. Soon thereafter, a weather reconnaissance plane reported a barometric pressure of 1000mbar (hPa; 29.53inHg) at the storm's center. Around 18:00UTC (1:00p.m. CDT), the newly named Abby attained peak winds of 65mph (100km/h). It subsequently made landfall near Matagorda, Texas four hours later. Once onshore gradual weakening ensued, though a brief period of re-organization delayed its dissipation. Abby degenerated into an area of showers on August8 southwest of San Antonio, Texas.|$|E
