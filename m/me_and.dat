40|$|Two novel type I ribosome-inactivating {{proteins}} (RIPs) {{were found}} in the storage roots of Mirabilis expansa, an underutilized Andean root crop. The two RIPs, named <b>ME</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>ME</b> 2, were purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange perfusion chromatography, and C 4 reverse-phase chromatography. The two proteins were found to be similar in size (27 and 27. 5 kD) by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and their isoelectric points were determined to be greater than pH 10. 0. Amino acid N-terminal sequencing revealed that both <b>ME</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>ME</b> 2 had conserved residues characteristic of RIPs. Amino acid composition and western-blot analysis further suggested a structural similarity between <b>ME</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>ME</b> 2. ME 2 showed high similarity to the Mirabilis jalapa antiviral protein, a type I RIP. Depurination of yeast 26 S rRNA by <b>ME</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>ME</b> 2 demonstrated their ribosome-inactivating activity. Because these two proteins were isolated from roots, their antimicrobial activity was tested against root-rot microorganisms, among others. <b>ME</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>ME</b> 2 were active against several fungi, including Pythium irregulare, Fusarium oxysporum solani, Alternaria solani, Trichoderma reesei, and Trichoderma harzianum, and an additive antifungal effect of <b>ME</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>ME</b> 2 was observed. Antibacterial activity of both <b>ME</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>ME</b> 2 was observed against Pseudomonas syringae, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Agrobacterium radiobacter, and others...|$|R
30|$|In shoot samples, two Eigen gene vectors (<b>ME</b> 8 <b>and</b> <b>ME</b> 14) {{under the}} cold {{condition}} (Fig.  3 b) had very sharp angles (less than 15 °) to P(HEAT, SALT). This {{implies that the}} expression patterns of these two Eigen genes are similar under the heat and salt conditions but very different under the cold condition in shoot samples (Fig.  2). Similarly, <b>ME</b> 9 <b>and</b> <b>ME</b> 17 were heat-specific Eigen genes only in shoot samples. Four Eigen genes (ME 2, ME 6, <b>ME</b> 12, <b>and</b> <b>ME</b> 18) were identified as salt-specific only in root samples. Two Eigen genes, <b>ME</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>ME</b> 11, were identified as salt-specific and heat-specific, respectively, in both root and shoot tissues.|$|R
5|$|The record shows, {{that for}} nearly thirty years, {{elements}} of the U.S. Department of Justice {{have been engaged in}} world-wide political targeting of <b>me</b> <b>and</b> my associates. This includes early 1970s operations run in conjunction with Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's U.S. State Department. During the last ten years or so of that period, some U.S. officials, and others, have challenged the relevant agencies with some of the evidence which shows, that those prosecutions and correlated harassment of <b>me</b> <b>and</b> my associates, had been clearly fraudulent, politically motivated targeting.|$|E
