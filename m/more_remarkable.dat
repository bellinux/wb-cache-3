5|$|It is {{wonderful}} {{that both of}} these things occurred under Valerian; {{and it is the}} <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> in this case when we consider his previous conduct, for he had been mild and friendly toward the men of God, for none of the emperors before him had treated them so kindly and favorably; and not even those who were said openly to be Christians received them with such manifest hospitality and friendliness as he did {{at the beginning of his}} reign. For his entire house was filled with pious persons and was a church of God.|$|E
5|$|Orkney has an {{abundance}} of wildlife, especially of grey and common seals and seabirds such as puffins, kittiwakes, tysties, ravens, and bonxies. Whales, dolphins, and otters are also seen around the coasts. Inland the Orkney vole, a distinct subspecies of the common vole introduced by Neolithic humans, is an endemic. There are five distinct varieties, found on the islands of Sanday, Westray, Rousay, South Ronaldsay, and the Mainland, all the <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> as the species is absent on mainland Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Ramsey led {{his side}} to become champions of England in their debut {{season at the}} top level. The side had been tipped by many contemporary football pundits and journalists for relegation {{at the start of}} the season, making the achievement all the <b>more</b> <b>remarkable.</b> Ramsey created a strong side based on a resolute defence and two strikers, Ray Crawford and Ted Phillips who between them scored over sixty goals. The key to the side was considered to be left-winger, Jimmy Leadbetter whom Ramsey moved into a deep-lying, left of centre midfielder.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his book}} Germania, Tacitus {{wrote that the}} ancient Germanic tribes {{enforced}} a similar prohibition. He found such <b>mores</b> <b>remarkable</b> and commented: [...] "Germani hold it shameful to kill any unwanted child." [...] Modern scholarship differs. John Boswell believed that in ancient Germanic tribes unwanted children were exposed, usually in the forest. [...] "It was the custom of the Teutonic pagans, that {{if they wanted to}} kill a son or daughter, they would be killed before they had been given any food." [...] Usually children born out of wedlock were disposed that way.|$|R

5|$|The {{history of}} the {{publication}} of Opus 50 set betrays one of the <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> examples of Haydn's financial and commercial impropriety. Haydn hurriedly completed the set by September 1787, when he sent the fifth quartet to Artaria. Meanwhile, in August, he had offered the set to the English publisher William Forster, who duly printed the six quartets before Artaria did. Haydn was deceiving both publishers: the offer to Forster was unbeknown to Artaria, while Haydn misled Forster into believing that no-one else had been offered the set. Artaria learned of the Forster deal but published the set anyway, in December 1787, as Haydn's Opus 50.|$|E
5|$|Gott ist mein König is a {{significant}} early work of Bach. It differs from the other extant cantatas from Bach's time in Mühlhausen by its elaborate instrumentation. It was so positively received {{that it was the}} first of Bach's works to be printed (paid for by the city council); it is the only cantata to have been printed in his lifetime, at least in a version which has survived to this day. The printing is all the <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> as Gott ist mein König appears to have been intended for not more than one repeat performance, and a new piece was commissioned the following year. Bach was commissioned to compose another cantata for the following year's council inauguration; there is evidence that the piece was composed and even printed, but no copies are known to survive.|$|E
5|$|In January 1532, Cranmer was {{appointed}} the resident ambassador {{at the court}} of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V. As the emperor travelled throughout his realm, Cranmer had to follow him to his residence in Ratisbon (Regensburg). He passed through the Lutheran city of Nuremberg and saw {{for the first time}} the effects of the Reformation. When the Imperial Diet was moved to Nuremberg in the summer, he met the leading architect of the Nuremberg reforms, Andreas Osiander. They became good friends, and during that July Cranmer took the surprising action of marrying Margarete, the niece of Osiander's wife. This was all the <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> given that the marriage required him to set aside his priestly vow of celibacy. He did not take her as his mistress, as was the prevailing custom with priests for whom celibacy was too rigorous. Scholars note that Cranmer had moved, however moderately at this stage, into identifying with certain Lutheran principles. This progress in his personal life was not matched in his political life as he was unable to persuade Charles, Catherine's nephew, to support the annulment of his aunt's marriage.|$|E

50|$|Although {{his natural}} {{position}} {{was that of}} left midfielder, he could also play as a central one. He had a <b>more</b> than <b>remarkable</b> technique and a powerful mid-range shot coming in second line, combined with good passing and tackling abilities.|$|R
5|$|Ironically, manager John Sillett {{spent much}} of the money from Coventry's FA Cup run (£750,000) on Chelsea striker David Speedie, who would replace Houchen in front of goal. Sillett's one {{consolation}} to Houchen was that he would play him in the 1987 FA Charity Shield, which ended in a 1–0 defeat to Everton. The 1987–88 season was poor for both club and player, as illness, injury and competition from Speedie, Gary Bannister and Cyrille Regis restricted Houchen to just three goals and 24 appearances. On 14 August 1988, he was selected by Graham Taylor to represent the Football League in a game against Scunthorpe United to celebrate the opening of Glanford Park; Houchen scored once in a 6–1 victory. He scored just twice in sixteen appearances in 1988–89, though one of these goals was the winner against Midlands rivals Aston Villa in a 2–1 Boxing Day victory at Highfield Road. He also featured as a substitute in the infamous 2–1 defeat to Conference club Sutton United at Gander Green Lane. The result was all the <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> considering that Coventry went on to finish seventh in the league and that Houchen was one of ten Coventry players that day who had won the FA Cup less than two years previously.|$|E

25|$|Sumerian {{metallurgy}} and goldsmithing {{were highly}} developed. This {{is all the}} <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> for a region where metals had to be imported.

Sumerians used bronze, although the scarcity of tin meant that they used arsenic instead. Metalworking techniques included lost-wax casting, plating, filigree, and granulation.|$|E
25|$|His {{greatest}} {{performance as}} a player, however, came in January 2000 when England played Zimbabwe in the fifth match of a triangular tournament held in South Africa.

50|$|The {{importance}} of this house inside the Spanish city {{and of all the}} autonomous community is <b>more</b> than <b>remarkable.</b> It is the epitome of a classic Valladolid palace, with its distinctly Renaissance frontage and especially its playground.

There are other similar palaces in the city, as the one of the Villagómez, that also fulfil this characteristic, but the majesty of the Fabio Nelli palace is unique.|$|R

25|$|Educated at Loretto College, Evans was a {{right-handed}} middle-order batsman and {{an occasional}} fast-medium right-arm bowler.

Yet his career average was less than 10. This lack of success is <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> as he passed 50 runs in an innings twice in his career, one of them a not-out innings.|$|E
