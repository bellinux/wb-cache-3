500|$|Pickett {{was popular}} as a cadet at West Point. He was mischievous and a player of pranks, [...] "a <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>ability,</b> but {{belonging}} to a cadet set that appeared to have no ambition for class standing and wanted to do only enough study to secure their graduation." [...] At a time when often {{a third of the}} class left before graduation, Pickett persisted, working off his demerits and doing enough in his studies to graduate, ranking last out of the 59 surviving students in the Class of 1846. It is a position held with some backhanded distinction, referred to today as the [...] "goat", both for its stubbornness and tenacity. Pickett's cousin Henry Heth graduated last in the Class of 1847.|$|E
500|$|Brittan's daughter's biographer (Rosamund Rolleston, his great-granddaughter) {{described}} him as [...] "a <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> and a polished speaker [...] biting, sarcastic manner made him both feared and disliked", and as [...] "quarrelsome and uncompromising". [...] In his obituary, he was described [...] "as a speaker [...] took very high rank, possessing a force and fluency of expression, a power of lucid statement, and a readiness in debate, which {{with one or two}} exceptions have never been equalled in the Council." [...] Brittan Street was named for him and first appeared in street directories in 1892. Linwood House, which fronted onto both Linwood Avenue and Brittan Street, was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a class D heritage building in 1982, and with a change of the classification system later, it later became a Category II listing. Significantly damaged in both the September 2010 and the February 2011 earthquakes, Civil Defence ordered the building's demolition in March 2011, which was carried out later that year.|$|E
2500|$|In 1900, writer Hamlin Garland met Cornelius in El Reno, Oklahoma, and {{described}} him as [...] "a giant in size and a <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> who located here after a most astonishing career in New York." [...] Garland credits Cornelius for suggesting that Indians be given standard surnames to protect their property rights during the land allotment process. At the time, there was no system of surnames for Indians through which legal titles could be traced, allotment of lands to individuals were, {{and the source of}} unnecessary confusion and litigation. After appealing to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Garland was hired to manage the project for several years.|$|E

50|$|The S. L. P. {{ignored the}} {{psychology}} of struggling workers says. Its propaganda was couched in abstract formulas; just as its sectarian spirit developed a sort of subconscious idea that revolutionary activity consisted in enunciating formulas.

60|$|At length, in 1759, Sir Jeffrey Amherst was {{appointed}} commander-in-chief {{of all the}} British forces in America. He was a <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> and a skilful soldier.

500|$|Hamilton {{was invited}} to become an aide to William Alexander, Lord Stirling and one other general, perhaps Nathanael Greene or Alexander McDougall. He {{declined}} these invitations, believing his best chance for improving his station in life was glory on the battlefield. Hamilton eventually received an invitation he felt he could not refuse: to serve as Washington's aide, with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Washington felt, [...] "Aides de camp are persons in whom entire confidence must be placed and it requires <b>men</b> <b>of</b> <b>abilities</b> to execute the duties with propriety and dispatch." ...|$|R

6000|$|Dear Sir, You send to Mr. W---- {{an extract}} {{from a letter}} written at New Orleans the 9th instant, which is shown to me. You do not give the writer's name; but plainly he is a <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>ability,</b> and {{probably}} of some note. He says: [...] "The time has arrived when Mr. Lincoln must take a decisive course. Trying to please everybody, he will satisfy nobody. A vacillating policy in matters of importance is the very worst. Now is the time, if ever, for honest men who love their country to rally to its support. Why will not the North say officially that it wishes {{for the restoration of}} the Union as it was?" ...|$|E
60|$|The fact is, {{most of the}} grandiose {{talk about}} the vast gulf which {{separates}} genius from mere talent has been published and set abroad by those fortunate persons who fell, or fancied themselves to fall, under the former highly satisfactory and agreeable category. Genius, in short, real or self-suspected, has always been at great pains to glorify itself {{at the expense of}} poor, commonplace, inferior talent. There is a certain type of great man in particular which is never tired of dilating upon the noble supremacy of its own greatness over the spurious imitation. It offers incense obliquely to itself in offering it generically to the class genius. It brings ghee to its own image. There are great men, for example, such as Lord Lytton, Disraeli, Victor Hugo, the Lion Comique, and Mr. Oscar Wilde, who pose perpetually as great men; they cry aloud to the poor silly public so far beneath them, 'I am a genius! Admire me! Worship me!' Against this Byronic self-elevation on an aërial pedestal, high above the heads of the blind and battling multitude, we poor common mortals, who are not unfortunately geniuses, are surely entitled to enter occasionally our humble protest. Our contention is that the genius only differs from the <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> as the <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> differs from the intelligent man, and the intelligent man from the worthy person of sound common sense. The sliding scale of brains has infinite gradations; and the gradations merge insensibly into one another. There is no gulf, no gap, no sudden jump of nature; here as elsewhere, throughout the whole range of her manifold productions, our common mother saltum non facit.|$|E
60|$|Talking of a {{taste for}} {{painting}} and sculpture, Powers observed {{that it was something}} very different and quite apart from the moral sense, and that it was often, perhaps generally, possessed by unprincipled <b>men</b> <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> and cultivation. I have had this perception myself. A genuine love of painting and sculpture, and perhaps of music, seems often to have distinguished <b>men</b> capable <b>of</b> every social crime, and to have formed a fine and hard enamel over their characters. Perhaps it is because such tastes are artificial, the product of cultivation, and, when highly developed, imply a great remove from natural simplicity.|$|R
