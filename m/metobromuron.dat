40|$|AbstractThe herbicide, Galex, {{containing}} 25 % of metolachlor and 25 % of <b>metobromuron</b> {{dissolved in}} 46. 7 % emulsifiable concentrate was widely {{used for the}} control of grasses and broad-leaf weeds in the 1990 s {{and continues to be}} used today. <b>Metobromuron,</b> a substitute urea herbicide, may cause methemoglobinemia in humans, but very few studies are available about the harmful effects on humans. We report here a case where a 47 -year-old man developed severe methemoglobinemia 10 hours after ingestion of 1000 mL of Galex. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure with coma occurred suddenly. After ventilator support was instituted, intravenous methylene blue (1 %, 2 mg/kg) was administrated immediately. A second dose of methylene blue was given because of a persistent high level of methemoglobin 2 hours later. The patient was weaned from the ventilator on day 4. However, hemolytic anemia, possibly due to the administration of methylene blue, occurred and persisted to day 11. This resolved gradually only after multiple blood transfusions. Ingestion of a large volume of herbicide containing <b>metobromuron,</b> a substituted urea herbicide, can induce late-onset methemoglobinemia in humans and, while rare, may be fatal if not observed for a sufficient time in the emergency department. Death is possible following the ingestion of this herbicide when adequate diagnoses and treatment are not instituted. Methylene blue is useful in reversing methemoglobinemia, but the side effects such as hemolytic anemia should be monitored, especially at doses exceeding 4 mg/kg or in patients with glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) deficiency. Clinicians should consider the relevant history of G 6 PD deficiency before using methylene blue to decrease the risk of unnecessary hemolytic anemia. Methemoglobinemia in patients with G 6 PD deficiency is best treated with blood transfusions...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} the soil fungus Rhizoctonia solani to degrade phenyl-substituted urea {{herbicides}} was investigated. The fungus was able to transform chlorbromuron [3 -(3 -chloro- 4 -bromophenyl) - 1 -methyl- 1 -methoxyurea] to the demethylated product [3 -(3 -chloro- 4 -bromophenyl) - 1 -methoxyurea], which was isolated and identified. Evidence was obtained that further degradation of chlorbromuron occurred. Several other phenylurea compounds (chloroxuron, diuron, fenuron, fluometuron, linuron, <b>metobromuron,</b> neburon, and siduron) were also metabolized by the fungus, indicating that R. solani may possess a generalized ability to attack this group of herbicides...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{treated with}} linuron {{for more than}} 10 years showed high {{biodegradation}} activity towards methoxymethyl urea herbicides, Untreated control soil samples taken from the same location did not express any linuron degradation activity, even after 40 days of incubation. Hence, the occurrence {{in the field of}} a microbiota having the capacity to degrade a specific herbicide was related to the long-term treatment of the soil. The enrichment culture isolated from treated soil showed specific degradation activity towards methoxy-methyl urea herbicides, such as linuron and <b>metobromuron,</b> while dimethyl urea herbicides, such as diuron, chlorotoluron, and isoproturon, were not transformed. The putative metabolic intermediates of linuron and <b>metobromuron,</b> the aniline derivatives 3, 4 -dichloroaniline and 4 -bromoaniline, were also degraded. The temperature of incubation drastically affected degradation of the aniline derivatives. Whereas linuron was transformed at 28 and 37 degreesC, 3, 4 -dichloroaniline was transformed only at 28 degreesC. Monitoring the enrichment process by reverse transcription-PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) showed that a mixture of bacterial species under adequate physiological conditions was required to completely transform linuron, This research indicates that for biodegradation of linuron, several years of adaptation have led to selection of a bacterial consortium capable of completely transforming linuron, Moreover, several of the putative species appear to be difficult to culture since they were detectable by DGGE but were not culturable on agar plates...|$|E

40|$|Two {{trials were}} carried out during 1972. and 1974. in which more {{different}} herbicides were applied for the weed control in potatoes. Metribuzin, cyanazine, metoxuron, linuron, metobromuton, cyanazine + linuron and terbutryne + GS- 13259 have been tested in Velika Gorica during 1972 - Metrilbuzin, prometryne chlorbromuron, metoxuron, atrazin + prometryne, alachlor + linuron, linuron + monolinuron and prometryn + simazin were included in trial during 1974. The applications were made 7 (V. Gorica) and 19 (K. Kraljevac) days after planting. Much better weed control has been obtained when herbicides were applied 19 than 7 days after planting. Metribuzin, <b>metobromuron</b> and a mixture cyannazin + linuron gave the best weed control in 1972.

40|$|Phenylurea {{herbicides}} are {{an important}} group of herbicides utilized in weed control. They have been on sale since the 1950 s and are still in common use throughout the world from pre- and post-emergence control of many annual and perennial broad-leaved weeds. The aim of this work was to evaluate {{the utility of the}} QuEChERS method for the determination of phenylurea pesticides (chlortoluron, isoproturon, linuron, <b>metobromuron,</b> metoxuron, monolinuron) in beetroot by HPLC with UV/Vis detection. Different types of sorbents (PSA, C 18, SAX and NH 2) and solvents (hexane, ethyl acetate) were applied. The obtained results showed that the best recovery ratios were received for the method with PSA and GCB sorbents and using acetonitrile as an extraction solvent with RSD lower than 15 % for most compounds. The linearity of calibration curves was higher than 0. 98 for all target analytes. The results show that the QuEChERS method can be successfully applied for the determination of phenylurea herbicides in beetroot...|$|E
40|$|Four {{different}} methacrylic acid-based, molecularly imprinted, polymers, using fenuron or isoproturon as template and acetonitrile or toluene as porogen, {{were prepared}} {{in order to}} evaluate the template size effect on the selectivity and the porogen effect on the affinity of recognition in molecular imprinting solid-phase extraction. The results of different tests applied to both polymers have shown that fenuron-polymers were highly selective whereas isoproturon-polymers were able to recognise several structurally related compounds (metoxuron, fenuron, <b>metobromuron,</b> chlortoluron, linuron and chlorbromuron). On the other hand, the polymers prepared using toluene as porogen showed a higher affinity for the tested compounds than those prepared in acetonitrile. Accordingly, the isoproturon-imprinted polymer prepared in toluene has been evaluated as a new sorbent in solid-phase extraction procedures for the trace-enrichment and clean-up of phenyureas in ground water and soil samples.

40|$|A diuron-degrading {{endophyte}} DP 8 - 1 {{was isolated}} from sugarcane root grown in diuron-treated {{soil in the}} present study. The endophyte was identified as Neurospora intermedia based on the morphological characteristics and sequence analysis. The fermentation parameters including temperature, pH, inoculation size, carbon source, and initial diuron concentration were also investigated for the optimization of degradation efficiency. The results indicated that strain DP 8 - 1 was capable of degrading up to 99 % diuron within 3 days under the optimal degrading condition. The study of degradation spectrum indicated that strain DP 8 - 1 could also degrade and utilize fenuron, monuron, <b>metobromuron,</b> isoproturon, chlorbromuron, linuron, and chlortoluron as substrate for strain growth. On basis of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis for {{the products of the}} degradation of diuron, strain DP 8 - 1 metabolized diuron to produce N-(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) -urea and N-(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) -N-methylurea through sequential N-dealkylations.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the inclusion process of phenylurea herbicide <b>metobromuron</b> (MB) in beta cyclodextrin (ß-CD) with 1 : 1 stoichiometry using: (1) MM+ force field of molecular mechanics {{in order to}} research the lowest energy structure of the inclusion complex. (2) Superior levels of calculations were made such PM 3, B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G*, HF/ 6 - 31 G* and ONIOM 2 methods in order to approach the ideal geometry and provide further insight into the different complexation properties of the guest molecule. The data suggest that: The B orientation is significantly more favourable than the A orientation by an energy difference of 1. 02 kcal mol - 1 according to PM 3 calculations. The geometry of the most stable complex shows that the aromatic ring is deeply self-included inside the hydrophobic cavity of ß-CD also an intermolecular hydrogen bond is established between host and guest molecules. The formation of the inclusion complex is predicted to be an enthalpy-driven process in gas phase which is {{in accord with the}} experimental results. The statistical thermodynamic calculations by PM 3 demonstrate that 1 : 1 MB/ ß-CD complex is favored by a negative enthalpy change...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} multiresidue {{method for}} the simultaneous determination of seven pesticides in fresh vegetable samples, namely, courgette (Cucurbita pepo), cucumber (Cucumis sativus), lettuce (Lactuca sativa, Romaine and Iceberg varieties) and peppers (Capsicum sp.) is described. The procedure, based on microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) and analysis by liquid chromatography– photodiode array (LC–PDA) detection {{was applied to}} four carbamates (carbofuran, carbaryl, chlorpropham and EPTC) and three urea pesticides (monolinuron, <b>metobromuron</b> and linuron). Extraction solvent {{and the addition of}} anhydrous sodium sulphate to fresh vegetable homogenate before MAE were the parameters optimised for each commodity. Recovery studies were performed using spiked samples in the range 250 – 403 µgkg- 1 in each pesticide. The pesticide residues were extracted using 20 mL acetonitrile at 60 ºC, for 10 min. Acceptable recoveries and RSDs were attained (overall average recovery of 77. 2 % and RSDs are lower than 11 %). Detection limits ranged between 5. 8 µgkg- 1 for carbaryl to 12. 3 µgkg- 1 for carbofuran.

40|$|Two {{different}} molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) {{were prepared}} by precipitation polymerization using linuron or isoproturon (phenylurea herbicides) as templates and trifluormethacrylic acid as functional monomer. These materials {{were used as}} selective sorbents {{in the development of}} molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE) procedures for the determination of several phenylurea herbicides (fenuron, metoxuron, chlortoluron, isoproturon, <b>metobromuron,</b> and linuron) in plant samples extracts. The MISPE procedures were fully optimized and applied to the clean up of selected phenylurea herbicides in carrot, potato, corn, and pea sample extracts and finally determined by HPLC-UV at 244 nm. Although a high degree of clean up was obtained, a decrease of the MIP recognition capabilities was observed in subsequent runs. Thus, a previous clean up protocol based on the use of a non-imprinted polymer was used to prevent the loss of MIP performance and to ease the removal of interferences. Following this procedure, namely two-step MISPE, matrix compounds were almost completely removed by the non-imprinted polymer retaining the ability of MIPs to selectively rebind target analytes unaltered. The developed MISPE procedures allowed the screening of phenylurea herbicides in plant samples at concentration levels required by established European maximum residue limits.

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Activated carbon is {{effective}} in protecting beans from herbicide injury. In a field study, diuron [3 -(3, 4 - dichlorophenyl) - 1 - 1 - dimethyl urea], linuron [3 - (3, 4 - dichloropheny 1) - 1 - methoxy- 1 - naethylurea], fluometuron [1, 1 -dimethyl- 3 -(α, α, α -trifluoro- m-toly 1) urea], and <b>metobromuron</b> [3, (2 - bromophenyI) - 1 - 1 - rnethoxy- 1 - methyl urea] we re {{used to determine the}} effectiveness of a one-inch band of activated carbon (Aqua Nuchar A) applied over the bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) row in protecting the crop from herbicide injury. Activated carbon was applied at 0, 150 and 300 pounds per acre, broadcast basis, while diuron, linuron, fluometuron and <b>metobromuron</b> were applied at rates of 1. 0 and 2. 0, 2. 0 and 4. 0, 1. 0 and 2. 0, and 1. 0 and 2. 0 lbs /acre, respectively. The results obtained showed that when activated carbon was used as a band treatment of one inch over the row (broadcast basis) at a rate of 150 pounds per acre, prior to herbicide application, good crop protection was obtained for all herbicide treatments at all rates. However, the activated carbon also protected that weeds that germinated under the carbon band. In the greenhouse, the influence of band width was determined by applying 0, 150 and 300 pounds per acre of carbon in bands of 1. 0 and 3. 0 inches in width. A carbon band of 1. 0 inch provided adequate protection to the beans for all rates tested. No injury was observed in either the roots or the shoots, for all rates tested. The effectiveness of activated carbon in protecting four plant species, beans, ryegrass (Lolium perenne Var. Linn L.), pigweed Amaranthus retroflexus L.) and barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalli (L) Beauv) from diuron injury was also determined in a greenhouse experiment. It was found that activated carbon to diuron ratios of 100 : 1 were effective in protecting the four species tested. Experiments with 2 -gram "packets" of vermiculite with carbon showed that beans were protected from diuron injury only when the packet contained carbon. Application of activated carbon mixed in with a vermiculite "packet" was as effective as applying the carbon in a one-inch band over the row. In an experiment involving alternate wetting and drying of activated carbon no decrease of the adsorptive capacity of the carbon was observed. In the laboratory the adsorption of diuron at 7, 10 and 20 ppm by four commercial types of activated carbon (Aqua Nuchar A, Darco-M, Gro-Safe and Pittsburg No. 3) was determined. The results indicated that differences exist between different carbon sources. The greater the surface area of the carbon, the greater its adsorptivity. Desorption studies with diuron at 20 ppm and four different activated carbon sources showed that the degree of desorption also varied between the carbon sources...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy and {{economic benefits of}} selected pre-emergence herbicides for weed control in cowpea. Study Design: Randomized complete block design with four replications was used. Place and Duration of Study: Research and Teaching Farm of Ambrose Alli University in Ekpoma (Lat. 6 º 45 ’N, Long. 6 º 8 ’E), in a forest-savanna transition zone of Nigeria, between August and December 2005 and August and December 2006. Methodology: Five weed control treatments evaluated against unweeded control were; Codal gold(R) (250 g prometryne + 162. 5 g metolachlor per litre) {{at a rate of}} 1. 65 kg a. i ha- 1, Galex(R) (Metolachlor 250 g + <b>metobromuron</b> 250 g per litre) at the rate of 3. 0 kg a. 1. ha- 1; Pendilin(R) (Pendimethalin 500 g per litre) at a rate of 2. 0 kg a. i ha- 1, one hoe – weeding at 3 weeks after planting (WAP) and two hoe weeding at 3 and 7 WAP. Results: Herbicides treatments and hoe weeded twice gave an acceptable (³ 70 %) weed control in both years. Cowpea yield was best under Codal gold at 1. 65 kg a. i ha- 1 (with an average yield of ≥ 1600 kg ha- 1) while the unweeded control had the poorest yield (between 800 and 900 kg ha- 1) in both years. The highest profit was obtained under Codal gold at 1. 65 kg a. i ha- 1 and the lowest in plot hoe weeded twice. The highest cost benefit ratio (CBR) of 24. 61 in 2005 and 28. 21 in 2006 were recorded with Codal goldR treated plot while the lowest of 1. 25 and 1. 22 were obtained in 2005 and 2006 respectively under plot hoe weeded twice. Conclusion: Codal gold(R) at 1. 65 kg a. i ha- 1 was better than the other herbicides tried, in reducing weed infestation in cowpea as evidenced on the performance, yield of cowpea and higher economic returns. With the range of herbicides tried in this study, Codal gold(R) at 1. 65 kg a. i ha- 1 appears to be the best herbicide for weed control in cowpea under the present study...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{contributes to}} the study and {{development of a new}} degradation technique that couples solar and biological processes for the treatment of biorecalcitrant, nonbiodegradable, and/or toxic organic substances present in the aqueous medium. Efficient physicochemical pretreatments are necessary to modify the structure of the pollutants, by transforming them into less toxic and biodegradable intermediates, allowing then, a biological procedure to complete the degradation of the pollutant load in a shorter time and in a less expensive way. The strategy of coupling photochemical and biological processes implicates among others, the study of some fundamental physicochemical properties, the optimization of a coupled reactor at laboratory scale (2 litres), and the study of solar photocatalytic treatment efficacy under direct sunlight using parabolic collectors of 40 to 200 litres. The study of the structure effect on the photoreactivity via TiO 2 catalysis is studied using several substituted phenols to cover a wide variety of electronic effects, ranging from strong electron-donating (activating) to strong electron-withdrawing (deactivating) groups and herbicides with very similar molecular structures (<b>metobromuron,</b> isoproturon, chlorbromuron, and chlorotoluron). The photoreactivity of these compounds is affected by the electronic nature of the substituents and their positions in the aromatic ring, being higher when there is a greater electronic density. The Hammett constant, which represents the effect that different substituents have on the electronic character of the aromatic studied compounds, appears to give an adequate descriptor of their photocatalytic degradability. One important consideration in the TiO 2 -photocatalysed reactions is the adsorption of the organic compound on the surface of semiconductor particles. The dark adsorption isotherms for complete p-halophenols series and four herbicides are measured and correlated with their photoreactivity. The results indicate that no direct correlation exists between the extents of adsorption and the initial photodegradation rates of the studied compounds. Concerning the optimization and utilization of an integrated photocatalytic-biological process at laboratory scale, two kinds of combined systems are developed using immobilized biomass for the biological step and either diluted Fe 3 +/H 2 O 3 (Fenton reaction) or TiO 2 supported on glass rings for the photocatalytic pre-treatment. The advantages of the latter system are that the catalyst can be re-used and that the pH of the solution remains at neutral values. The photo-Fenton reaction instead, renders the phototreated solution acidic making neutralization necessary. The photochemical-biological flow reactors mentioned above, are employed to completely mineralize an isoproturon-herbicide solution. Preliminary experiments concerning the chemical and biological characteristics of the phototreated solution, are carried out to determine the moment at which it becomes biocompatible. Two operation modes (continuous or semi-continuous) of the photo-Fenton-biological coupled reactor are compared by studying the efficiency of the photochemical, biological, and overall treatments of p-nitro-o-toluenesulfonic acid (p-NTS) in solution. The two main parameter affecting the performance of the photo-assisted reactor in continuous mode are related to the very low pollutant concentration that characterise this kind of operation mode and to the high residual H 2 O 3 concentration after the pretreatment. Thus, a semi-continuous mode was applied to try to overcome these inconveniences. In these conditions, 50 to 70 litres of polluted water can be treated per day per litre of photoreactor. The last part of this thesis, addresses the study of the solar photocatalytic treatment efficacy under direct sunlight using parabolic concentrating (Helioman reactors) and nonconcentrating (CPC) collectors. This part, carried out at the "Plataforma Solar de Almería" (PSA) in Spain, indicates that the solar photocatalytic treatment is effective for the purification of water contaminated by herbicides and other substances of industrial origin like the p-NTS. It is demonstrated the utility of both homogeneous (based on Fe 3 +/H 2 O 3 reaction) and heterogeneous photocatalysis (based on TiO 2) as pretreatment methods that can be followed by a biological treatment. Using a coupled system, the treatment of 100 to 300 litres of polluted water per square metre of photoreactor can be envisaged in a sunny day. The low manufacturing, installation, and maintenance costs, and easy operation of the CPC, compared with Helioman collectors, suggest that the former ones are, at present, the best way to apply the solar detoxification technology...|$|E
