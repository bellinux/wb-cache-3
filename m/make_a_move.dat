5|$|Draw by agreement: Draws {{are most}} {{commonly}} reached {{by mutual agreement}} between the players. The correct procedure is to verbally offer the draw, <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>move,</b> then start the opponent's clock. Traditionally, players {{have been allowed to}} agree to a draw at any point in the game, occasionally even without playing a move; in recent years efforts have been made to discourage short draws, for example by forbidding draw offers before move thirty.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{maturity}} {{is reached}} at between 1–3 years. Most Eurasian sparrowhawks {{stay on the}} same territory for one breeding season, though others keep the same one for up to eight years. A change of mate usually triggers the change in territory. Older birds tend {{to stay in the}} same territory; failed breeding attempts <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> more likely. The birds which kept the same territories had higher nest success, though it did not increase between years; females which moved experienced more success the year after changing territory.|$|E

5|$|Tallard's march {{presented}} a dilemma for Eugene. If the Allies {{were not to}} be outnumbered on the Danube, Eugene realised he must either try to cut Tallard off before he could get there or he must hasten to reinforce Marlborough. if he withdrew from the Rhine to the Danube, Villeroi might also <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> south to link up with the Elector and Marsin. Eugene compromised: leaving 12,000 troops behind guarding the Lines of Stollhofen, he marched off {{with the rest of his}} army to forestall Tallard.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{takes place}} in January 1967. Pete asks Joan to make a {{personal}} and moral sacrifice to ensure the company lands the Jaguar account.

Feeling unappreciated, Peggy has lunch with Freddy Rumsen, who encourages her to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>move.</b> Later, Peggy meets with Ted Chaough, from rival firm CGC, and accepts an offer for chief copywriter at CGC.|$|E
5|$|Panzer Dragoon Sagas battles {{take place}} while flying on the dragon. They mix {{real-time}} and turn-based elements, with three action gauges that charge in real time. When a gauge fills, the player can <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>move,</b> {{such as a}}ttacking or using an item such as a shield or poison cure. Waiting for multiple gauges to charge facilitates more options, such as making multiple moves in quick succession, but this gives the enemy more opportunity to attack. The speed at which the gauges charge is governed by the dragon's agility attribute; if this {{is higher than the}} enemy's agility attribute, the player can make moves more frequently than the enemy, and vice versa.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Simeon visited Constantinople, Constantine's mother Zoe {{returned}} to the palace on the insistence of the young emperor and immediately proceeded to eliminate the regents. Through a plot, she managed to assume power in February 914, practically removing Patriarch Nicholas from the government, disowning and obscuring his recognition of Simeon's imperial title, and rejecting the planned marriage of her son to one of Simeon's daughters. Simeon {{had to resort to}} war to achieve his goals. He invaded Thrace in the summer of 914 and captured Adrianople. Zoe was quick to send Simeon numerous presents in order to conciliate him, and she managed to convince him to cede back Adrianople and withdraw his army. In the following years, Simeon's forces were engaged in the northwestern Byzantine provinces, around Drač (Durrës) and Thessaloniki, but did not <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> against Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Steph later begins feuding with Summer Shaw (Summer Strallen), who {{was after}} a career in show business, {{everything}} she previously wanted. When Max split up with Steph, she was heartbroken. After a talk they decided they would both give it another go, and Steph asked him to meet her for lunch. Niall made sure Max thought that he and Steph had an affair. This resulted in Max and Steph splitting up once more. They reconciled, but the doubts continued. When Steph was at The Loft with Niall and Nancy, she saw Max with another girl and decided to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> of her own — grabbing Niall and kissing him passionately.|$|E
5|$|When a king {{is under}} {{immediate}} attack {{by one or}} two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in check. A response to a check is a legal move if it results in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack (that is, not in check). This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is illegal for a player to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> that would put or leave the player's own king in check.|$|E

25|$|Reid {{ruled that}} ceasefires proclaimed by the Ulster Defence Association and the Loyalist Volunteer Force {{could no longer}} be {{recognised}} by the government because of their involvement in sectarian attacks and murders. At the same time he put pressure on the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> on arms decommissioning to help end the political impasse, whilst acknowledging that putting its weapons beyond use would be a difficult step to take.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Vickers won the Nextel Open {{exhibition}} race. He {{was right}} behind Mike Bliss on the last lap. Rather than <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> to go around Bliss, Vickers ran {{into the back of}} the No. 0, spinning him out. Vickers went on to win. That qualified him for the annual Nextel All-Star Challenge, in which he finished third. Vickers finished the year seventeenth in Cup points with ten top tens. He also returned to the Busch Series in a limited capacity in 2005, and finished third at Watkins Glen in the No. 5. He drove five other races in the No. 57.|$|E

25|$|Earnhardt had the {{dominant}} {{car of the}} race, leading 115 out of 160 laps. On the last restart, he managed to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> from sixth to {{first place in the}} span of two laps, with Waltrip holding off the field as Earnhardt took the checkered flag. He won the MBNA Cal Ripken Jr. 400 at Dover, which was the first Cup race following the September 11 attacks as the original scheduled race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway was postponed {{until the end of the}} season. After the race, he performed a Polish victory lap while holding a large American flag out the driver's side window.|$|E
25|$|In the race, Harvard {{took the}} early lead {{out of the}} gate with Yale second. Both of the leaders’ strokes were long and slow while Cornell stuck to its stroke. At the half mile mark, Yale edged in front of Harvard but could not hold the lead form a surging Cornell who took a half boat lead {{by the end of the}} first mile. The Courtney-coached crew {{continued}} to build on their lead while Harvard sputtered and fell well behind Yale. Throughout the race, Cornell’s coxswain, Freddie Colson, motivated his teammates by reminding them of what their critic had said about them before the race. About a half mile from the finish, Yale tried to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> but it was too lateCornell won by 3 lengths.|$|E
25|$|Lee, who {{was already}} {{concerned}} {{about the ability of}} his weakening army to maintain the defense of Petersburg and Richmond, realized that the defeat at Fort Stedman would encourage Grant to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> like the one he was planning. Lee already had prepared to send some reinforcements to the western end of his line, and a mobile force beyond {{the end of the line}} to protect the junction at Five Forks, on the morning of March 29 when the Union infantry under Warren and Humphreys and the cavalry under Sheridan began their southwestward movements. Later that day Confederate forces under Major General Bushrod Johnson engaged Brevet Major General Charles Griffin's First Division of the V Corps at the Battle of Lewis's Farm.|$|E
5000|$|Some moves resolve automatically, {{but most}} involve {{an element of}} randomness. A player whose {{character}} <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> rolls two six-sided dice and adds the relevant modifier, which varies by <b>move</b> and game. <b>A</b> result of 10+ is a total success, and the character achieves their goal. On a result of 7-9, the character achieves a partial success, in which they mostly {{get what they want}} but also face some consequences or have to <b>make</b> do with <b>a</b> lesser version of their goal. A roll of 6 or less results in a [...] "miss," [...] and the Master of Ceremonies or Game Master <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> of their own, with negative consequences for the acting character.|$|R
50|$|The {{first player}} turns {{up a piece}} to begin the game. The color of that first {{uncovered}} piece is the color {{he or she will}} play in the game. The second player then <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>move,</b> and the two alternate until the game is finished.|$|R
50|$|To use premove, <b>a</b> player <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> in {{the same}} way they would move if it was their turn. After their {{opponent}} moves, the original player's move is immediately made, assuming that the move is still legal. Premove is not available in over-the-board chess.|$|R
25|$|Confederate General-in-chief Robert E. Lee, who {{was already}} {{concerned}} {{about the ability of}} his weakening army to maintain the defense of Petersburg and Richmond, realized that the Confederate defeat at Fort Stedman would encourage Grant to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> against his right flank and communication and transportation routes. On the morning of March 29, 1865, Lee already had prepared to send some reinforcements to the western end of his line and had begun to form a mobile force of about 10,600 infantry, cavalry and artillery under the command of Major General George Pickett and cavalry commander Major General Fitzhugh Lee. This force would go beyond {{the end of the line}} to protect the key junction at Five Forks from which a Union force could access the remaining open Confederate roads and railroads.|$|E
25|$|A player may not <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> if the {{resulting}} position {{is one that}} has previously occurred in the game with the same player to move. This is called repetition (千日手 sennichite). Note that certain pieces have the ability to pass in certain situations (lions, soaring eagles, horned falcons, vice generals, fire demons, free eagles, and lion hawks). Such a pass move leaves the position unchanged, but it does not violate the repetition rule, as it will now be the turn of the other player to move. Of course, two consecutive passes are not possible, as the first player will see the same position as before. However, evidence from historical chu shogi mating problems suggests that this prohibition does not apply to a player who is in check.|$|E
25|$|Leonard {{also has}} an affair with Raj's younger sister Priya (apparently every time she comes to town), despite a pinky swear with Howard that neither of them would attempt to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> on her, and Raj giving his strong disapproval. When Priya returns, she and Leonard begin a relationship. Raj {{strongly}} opposes this, and Penny is secretly uncomfortable with Leonard dating someone else, eventually breaking down and crying while talking with her friend Amy Farrah Fowler. Once again, Leonard is unaware of Penny's true feelings. Subsequently, Priya pressures Leonard into ending his friendship with Penny, which he attempts with extreme reluctance. Penny complies, though {{it is clear that}} she does not want Leonard out of her life. Penny eventually resolves to stay in Leonard's life by ingratiating herself to Priya.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{promotion}} zone in Nana shogi. Every time a piece (other than <b>a</b> king) <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> {{it changes}} its {{state in a}} specific manner. Promotion is effected by rolling the cube forward over after it moves, revealing the name of its new rank.|$|R
30|$|In the {{experiment}} setup, we consider a mobile robot always centered {{in on the}} human target. Whenever the human <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>move,</b> the robot head moves accordingly to bring the human {{back to the center}} of its sensor image. Under such situations, if the human target suddenly changes direction, the KF cannot catch up immediately because it cannot predict the target using the last few states that the body was going to <b>make</b> such <b>a</b> <b>move.</b> Under more general circumstances, it is impossible to predict if <b>a</b> human will <b>make</b> <b>a</b> sudden <b>move</b> from his present position. However, an alternate solution is to utilize past records of motion to help predict complicated movements of human subjects. That is why we extend KF to the area of mathematical curve matching in order to increase the state-space which may be used for prediction making.|$|R
2500|$|A player's {{promotion}} zone {{consists of}} the five far ranks, at the original line of the opponent's pawns and beyond.
