40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The purpose of this letter is to respond to Congressional request for information regarding the test and evaluation process conducted by the Department of Defense (DOD) of a specific synthetic lubricant called MILITEC- 1 that is produced by Militec, Inc., and the assignment and cancellation of national stock numbers 2 (NSN) associated with that product. Militec, Inc., has challenged DOD decisions not to include MILITEC- 1 in the federal supply system. Specifically, we examined (1) {{the extent to which}} the military services have tested and evaluated MILITEC- 1 as a small arms lubricant, as a <b>metal</b> <b>conditioner,</b> as a general purpose lubricant, and as a lubricant additive, and with what results; and (2) {{the extent to which the}} Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) followed applicable DOD procedures in assigning and subsequently canceling national stock numbers to MILITEC- 1. In addition, we are providing in enclosure I a timeline on the efforts to test and evaluate, and assign and cancel, NSNs for MILITEC- 1. MILITEC- 1 is a dry, impregnated, synthetic-based <b>metal</b> <b>conditioner</b> that, at the time of our review, has been primarily marketed as a small arms lubricant, although it is also marketed as an automotive and transportation lubricant. The product is packaged in several container sizes and is available for commercial purchase. According to DOD officials, in order for a product to be approved for use on small arms it must fulfill DOD's performance specifications by meeting a number of laboratory and live fire test requirements developed by the Army, which has cognizance across DOD for the specification for cleaner, lubricant, and preservative properties in small arms lubricants. Once a product has been approved and the services have determined that they have sufficient projected demand for the product, the services request that DLA assign the product an NSN [...] -a label assigned to items that are repeatedly purchased, stocked, stored, issued, and used throughout the federal supply system. ...|$|E
40|$|Qualified requesters may obtain {{copies of}} this report from DDC. When this study was {{initiated}} a list of 78 commercially avaiianle phosphate coatinhgs was compiled. After investiga-tion of the make-up and and factors of application involved in these products, {{it was discovered that}} only 41 had enough distinct differences to warrant their use in these compara-, tive tests. Fifty different sets of prepared specimens were used in this study. Forty-one commercial phosphating products, 3 commercial washprimers and 4 phosphating process solutions in use at the Rock Island Arsenal were used. Also included was a diluted commercial phosphoric acid rust remover and <b>metal</b> <b>conditioner</b> and one control set comprised only of cleaned steel. All phosphated panels were processed in accordance with directions supplied by the manufacturer. Six panels from each of the 50 sets of panels prepared were coated with one of the 9 different systems of organic coatings. The pre-pared panels were scored and mounted on outdoor exposure racks. This report covers the results of 8 years of South (at 45 degrees) exposure at Rock Island Arsenal! (A previou...|$|E
40|$|PATIENT: This report {{describes}} {{the longevity of}} a resin-bonded fixed partial denture (RBFPD). This denture was seated on the maxillary anterior teeth with minimal tooth preparation. The RBFPD was cast from a silver-palladium alloy (Castwell M. C. 12), and the pontic was veneered with an indirect composite material (Estenia). The retainers were primed with a <b>metal</b> <b>conditioner</b> (V-Primer) and seated with a tri-n-butylborane initiated adhesive resin (Super-Bond C&B). After an observation period of eight years, a fracture occurred in the incisal edge of the central incisor abutment. The fractured area was restored with light-polymerizing composite resin and the anterior guidance was re-adjusted. DISCUSSION: RBFPD abutment teeth with deep vertical overlap should be carefully prepared to avoid abutment tooth fracture. CONCLUSION: The clinical performance of the RBFPD made from a silver-palladium-copper-gold alloy was sufficient when seated with tri-n-butylborane initiated adhesive resin after surface modification using vinyl-thiol primer. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The use of vinyl-thiol primer and tri-n-butylborane initiated adhesive resin is a clinically reliable bonding system for seating resin-bonded fixed partial denture (RBFPD) made from a silver-palladium-copper-gold alloy. The RBFPD, based on a reliable bonding system, can clinically function for a long time, even if the vertical overlap of the abutment teeth is excessive...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} three <b>metal</b> <b>conditioners</b> on the shear bond strength (SBS) of a prosthetic composite material to cpTi grade I having three surface treatments. Material and Methods: One hundred sixty eight rivet-shaped specimens (8. 0 x 2. 0 mm) were cast and subjected to polishing (P) or sandblasting with either 50 mm (50 SB) or 250 mm (250 SB) Al 2 O 3. The <b>metal</b> <b>conditioners</b> <b>Metal</b> Photo Primer (MPP), Cesead II Opaque Primer (OP), Targis Link (TL), and one surface modification system Siloc (S), were applied to the specimen surfaces, which were covered with four 1 -mm thick layers of resin composite. The resin layers were exposed to curing light for 90 s separately. Seven specimens from each experimental group were stored in water at 37 &# 186;C for 24 h while the other 7 specimens were subjected to 5, 000 thermal cycles consisting of water baths at 4 &# 186;C and 60 &# 186;C (n= 7). All specimens were subjected to SBS test (0. 5 mm/min) until failure occurred, and further 28 specimens were analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Data were analyzed by 3 -way ANOVA followed by post-hoc Tukey's test (&# 945;= 0. 05). Results: On 50 SB surfaces, OP groups showed higher SBS means than MPP (P< 0. 05), while no {{significant difference was found}} among OP, S, and TL groups. On 250 SB surfaces, OP and TL groups exhibited higher SBS than MPP and S (P< 0. 05). No significant difference in SBS was found between OP and TL groups nor between MPP and S groups. The use of conditioners on 250 SB surfaces resulted in higher SBS means than the use of the same products on 50 SB surfaces (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Sandblasting {{associated with the use of}} <b>metal</b> <b>conditioners</b> improves SBS of resin composites to cpTi...|$|R
40|$|The {{orifice plate}} flow meter {{is the most}} common form of {{differential}} pressure flow meter used in industry. The standard discharge coefficient, which is defined by both British Standard and [SO 5167, is only valid if the flow approaching the meter is perfectly settled and fully developed. However, in practical applications the flow approaching the orifice meter is often disturbed by pipe-fittings and consequently the measurements become inaccurate. Basically, the design of the orifice plate meters that are independent of the upstream disturbances is a main goal for orifice plate metering. Either using a long straight pipe, or a flow conditioner upstream of an orifice plate, usually achieves this goal. In this project the effect of the fractal flow conditioner for both standard and non-standard flow conditions has been investigated in an experimental rig and simulation work. The results of using a combination of the fratal flow conditioner and orifice plate for non-standard flow conditions including swirling flow and asymmetric flow show that this package can preserve the accuracy of metering up to the level required in the Standards. The simulation results also show that the device can be used as a part of a flow metering package that will considerably reduce installation lengths. According to the main idea to introduce a predetermined turbulence flow caused by a flow conditioner for orifice plate flow metering, author was introduced another type of flow conditioner known as a <b>metal</b> foam flow <b>conditioner.</b> Open-cell <b>metal</b> foams with a porosity of 78. 8 % was formed and fashioned as a flow conditioner. Again the experimental results using the <b>metal</b> foam flow <b>conditioner</b> showed this <b>metal</b> foam flow <b>conditioner</b> demonstrated a good performance in terms of removing swirl and producing a repeatedly same flow profile within a short distance downstream of the flow conditioner. Furthermore, the low pressure drop across the metal foam is another advantage of this flow conditioner where the pressure loss coefficient for this flow conditioner is approximately 2. 5.
