5000|$|Novice {{boat owners}} {{who wish to}} do their own {{varnishing}} may be intimidated by horror stories recounted by ill-informed or malicious advisors, but with the use of quality products and modern techniques, {{there is no reason why}} the upkeep of <b>marine</b> <b>varnish</b> on a well-used vessel even in the tropic latitudes should be overly daunting.|$|E
50|$|Water-based {{paint is}} far easier and cheaper to apply, as undercoat, {{to produce a}} good smooth finish with a {{fraction}} of the time and effort of enamel paints, but harder and slower-drying enamel is best for the top coat {{on the outside of the}} hull, which is subject to a lot of bumps and scraps. Limit varnishing to smaller areas, such as grab rails, hatches, toe rails and trim, unless you have lots of patience and a very dust-free environment for varnishing. Use only marine gloss varnish on the outside, as interior varnish will peel off very quickly in hot sun and rain. <b>Marine</b> <b>varnish</b> has UV inhibitors to slow down peeling and fading. Never varnish a deck as it is slippery when wet. Even top-quality <b>marine</b> <b>varnish</b> is not as water-resistant as paint, so you must apply at least 4 coats. Often perfectionists will apply 8 coats or more to get a glass-like, reflective finish. Never varnish submerged parts like rudders.|$|E
50|$|Spar varnish (also called <b>marine</b> <b>varnish)</b> was {{originally}} {{intended for use}} on ship or boat spars, to protect the timber {{from the effects of}} sea and weather. Spars bend under the load of their sails. The primary requirements were water resistance and also elasticity, so as to remain adhering as the spars flexed. Elasticity was a pre-condition for weatherproofing too, as a finish that cracked would then allow water through, even if the remaining film was impermeable. Appearance and gloss was of relatively low value. Modified tung oil and phenolic resins are often used.|$|E
50|$|On boats, {{particularly}} wooden boats, brightwork {{is exposed}} metal and varnished woodworking, though amongst the yachting set it more often {{refers to the}} woodwork. The metal is usually brass or bronze that is kept polished, or stainless steel, which requires less maintenance. In the past, due to the environmental exposure experienced by boats, corrosion and UV damage made maintaining brightwork both Sisyphean and extremely labor-intensive. However, {{with the development of}} improved UV-absorbers and filters in the chemical composition of the various <b>marine</b> <b>varnishes</b> (spar varnish, polyurethane, or linear polyurethane), this work is not as intensive as it once was. Varnished finishes are maintained by sanding and re-finishing, and metalwork is maintained by polishing.|$|R
40|$|Weathering {{is one of}} {{the main}} reasons for the {{degradation}} of wood, especially its color. The application of finishes minimizes these effects. This study aimed to monitor the effect of artificial weathering on wood veneer of the species cumaru (Dipteryx odorata) and pau marfim (Balfourodendron riedelianum) with two finishes, the <b>marine</b> <b>varnish</b> and Cetol, with monitoring using a spectrophotometer. The samples were subjected to cycles of exposure to weathering for 20, 40, 52, 76, 124, 226, 430, 838 and 960 hours. The colorimetric parameters (L*, a*, b*, C and h*) were measured before treatment, after application of the products and during the weathering time intervals. The application of finishes darkened veneer of cumaru wood and pau marfim in nature. However, in higher weathering times, both species returned to a lighter color, and even became lighter than the natural wood. The use of Cetol was more efficient, giving greater stability in the conservation of wood color of the species studied...|$|E
