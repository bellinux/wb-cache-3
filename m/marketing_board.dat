5|$|Beginning in 1978, {{the economy}} of Côte d'Ivoire {{experienced}} a serious decline due to the sharp downturn in international market prices of coffee and cocoa. The decline was perceived as fleeting, since its impact on planters was buffered by the Caistab, the agricultural <b>marketing</b> <b>board,</b> which ensured them a livable income. The next year, in order to contain a sudden drop in the prices of exported goods, Houphouët-Boigny raised prices to resist international tariffs on raw materials. However, by applying only this solution, Côte d'Ivoire lost more than 700billion CFA francs between 1980 and 1982. From 1983 to 1984, Côte d'Ivoire fell victim to a drought that ravaged nearly 400,000 hectares of forest and 250,000 hectares of coffee and cocoa plants. To address this problem, Houphouët-Boigny travelled to London to negotiate an agreement on coffee and cocoa prices with traders and industrialists; by 1984, the agreement had fallen apart and Côte d'Ivoire was engulfed in a major financial crisis.|$|E

The farmers alleged misconduct on Minister's part. The House of Lords held that a minister's power under an Act is not unfettered, and that the Minister in question had effectively frustrated the objects of the statute as his non-exercise of the power had been based on a misunderstanding of the purpose for which the power was given to him. Parliament must have conferred the discretion with the intention that it should be used to promote the policy and objects of the Act, and the Minister could not act so as to frustrate the policy and objects of the Act.|$|E

25|$|When Dr Hastings Banda became Agriculture Minister in 1961, these {{policies}} were not greatly changed. The Agricultural Production and <b>Marketing</b> <b>Board</b> {{was replaced by}} the Farmers <b>Marketing</b> <b>Board</b> (FMB) in 1962, and European Board members were replaced by growers’ representatives. The Farmers <b>Marketing</b> <b>Board</b> was given wide powers to buy, sell and process farm products, promote price stability and subsidise seed and fertilizer. Banda recognised Malawi had few resources other than agriculture. He was an interventionist, and FMB became an aggressive purchaser of smallholders’ produce, but before 1969, its purchasing monopoly operated on a not-for-profit basis. This monopoly was partly neutralised by allowing co-operative societies to market crops, and African businessmen to act as carriers of produce, but little was done to raise producer prices. From 1963, the activities of the FMB included participation in business ventures through the provision of capital or loans. To accumulate investment funds competition in marketing African produce was restricted and the FMB's monopoly strengthened. The late colonial era administration’s policy of restricting food controls to a few crops in selected areas was abandoned by the African government. The Agriculture Minister was empowered to impose regulations affecting virtually every major food crop produced for sale or consumption by Africans in any district of the country. p.255.|$|E

However, trade has not yielded the anticipated results, in addition, aging trees and farms, low yields, inconsistent production patterns, disease incidence,npest attack and little agricultural mechanization has contributed to a stagnant cocoa industry.

40|$|Sum. : The {{economic}} policy of structural adjustment, which was initiated in most African countries during the 1980 s, posed {{a serious threat}} to agricultural <b>marketing</b> <b>boards</b> in sub-Saharan Africa. Two elements of structural adjustment were particularly ominous: 'privatization' threatened the continued existence of <b>marketing</b> <b>boards</b> as public enterprises, and the 'liberalization of trade' worsened the conditions under which they operated. On the basis of an extensive study of the literature, this report examines what actually happened to 39 <b>marketing</b> <b>boards</b> in 18 countries. The period covered is January 1980 till December 1989. The results, presented partly in the form of tables and partly as case studies, show that most <b>marketing</b> <b>boards</b> have survived but that their scope has been reduced.

500|$|The Ditton Laboratory, a short {{distance}} from the research station, was opened in 1930 by the Empire <b>Marketing</b> <b>Board</b> as a part of Cambridge University's Low Temperature Research Station. The purpose of the laboratory was to carry out experiments on the shipping of fruit across the high seas, in order to extend its life over long, seaborne journeys. This led to an experiment being carried out to simulate, as far as was possible, conditions on board a cargo ship, the so-called [...] "ship on land" [...] experiment. One focus of research was the Cox's Orange Pippin Apple, which had the reputation of being a difficult fruit to transport over long distances. In 1969 the laboratory was incorporated into the East Malling Research Station as the fruit storage section. After the building was boarded up, a fish farm and fruit distribution business continued at its rear. It has since been demolished and replaced by a modern housing estate.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, the keeping of Herdwicks became {{economically}} inviable without outside support; open market prices for Herdwick fleeces sometimes drop {{as low as}} a penny a kilogram (which is about the weight of wool from a single sheep).

The Trust now acts as a wool merchant itself, thus being able to bargain for better prices directly with the British Wool <b>Marketing</b> <b>Board</b> and operate a Herdwick wool trademark. [...] Most farmers survive through the sale of lambs, as well as both National Trust and European Union farm subsidies.

500|$|In the meantime, Reid's {{government}} took {{a number of}} policy initiatives. It passed legislation authorizing the government purchase of cattle from farmers who {{could no longer afford}} feed, and worked out a cost-sharing agreement with {{the federal government and the}} railways to relocate farmers fleeing the province's dust belt. Reid also called for the creation of a federal wheat <b>marketing</b> <b>board,</b> and proposed legislation—the Agricultural Industry Stabilisation Act—that protected from creditors any portion of a farmer's revenue that was used on operating costs for his farm or living expenses for his family. Despite these measures, Reid found himself at odds with his party's membership, which was reacting to the Great Depression by following an increasingly socialist path. He found UFA President Robert Gardiner to be of the [...] "far left", and considered the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, in whose founding many UFA members had participated, to be an [...] "unholy amalgamation". Even so, his government experimented with a form of universal health insurance, to be jointly funded by government, employers, and employees, that would provide Albertans with free medical, dental, and hospital care; the project was to be launched as a pilot project in Camrose, but was never begun because of the intervention of the 1935 election. More controversially, Reid's government reacted to McPherson's divorce and its attendant coverage by proposing to ban newspapers from covering divorce proceedings, a proposal that prompted Liberal MLA Joseph Miville Dechene to compare Reid to Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin.|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: p. 207 - 217. The {{object of}} this thesis {{is to examine}} the {{policies}} of South African agricultural <b>marketing</b> <b>boards,</b> both as separate entities and within the broader context of South African agricultural policy. Stabilisation and subsidisation are examined from a theoretical standpoint and the analysis supported with empirical evidence. The possibility of a centralised policy of price control is considered and a technique suggested whereby such a policy might be implemented. It is suggested, however,· that market uncertainty and the vast amount of information necessary make such an ambitious programme of market control unworkable in practice. The policies followed by some of the major <b>marketing</b> <b>boards</b> are examined. Three possibilities are identified: i) Revenue maximisation ii) Revenue stabilisation iii) Price/quantity stabilisation In view 6 f the wide differences between the boards in respect of type of product handled and export possibilities, it is to be expected that they will follow divergent policies. The evidence presented suggests, however, that the boards have not used their monopoly powers in the manner predicted by conventional economic theory. In the case of several of the boards, price policy seems to have been neutral. The reason for this disparity between theory and empirical obsel'. lvat:ion is discussed. The behaviour of South African agricultural <b>marketing</b> <b>boards</b> is related to evidence on regulatory authorities in the United States. It is suggested that close parallels exist. Due to different property rjghts arrangements, the conventional monopoly profit maximisation mode. I is inapplicable. Instead, <b>marketing</b> <b>boards</b> follow a variety of other policies. Whilst the objectives of the <b>marketing</b> <b>boards</b> may not always be clear, it can be concluded that in certain significant cases, the results have been little different from those generated by the free market. It is stressed, however, that <b>marketing</b> <b>boards</b> are political rather than economic organisations and political constraints are likely to be overriding. This view is further confirmed by an examination of agricultural policy over the last fifty years. It is argued that policy has been dictated by political reality rather than economic rationality. The role of the economist has been to offer evidence in support of predetermined policies...|$|R
