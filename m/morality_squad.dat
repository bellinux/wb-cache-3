50|$|Sleazy {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the 1992 Gwar film Phallus in Wonderland, as he assists them in the battle against The <b>Morality</b> <b>Squad.</b> Sleazy goes head to head with C.I.A. special agent Cerutti Fancypants, as the two produce larger and more elaborate firearms to one-up each other whilst killing bystanders. Of the <b>Morality</b> <b>Squad,</b> the CIA agent is the only one to not be seen dying.|$|E
5000|$|This was Gwar's {{first attempt}} at a commercially released, long-form movie. The story follows the story of Gwar's {{conflict}} with the <b>Morality</b> <b>Squad,</b> after the theft of Oderus' [...] "Cuttlefish". Meanwhile, the giant T-Rex, Gor-Gor is born and helps Gwar defeat the <b>Morality</b> <b>Squad.</b> The video {{was nominated for a}} Grammy in 1993. This video remains in print, though the DVD is extremely rare.|$|E
50|$|GWAR then {{travel to}} a nightclub, where they all become wasted on cocaine. The next morning, the Cuttlefish of Cthulhu (having escaped the Morality Squad's grasp) reunites with a hung over Oderus, and warns {{them of the}} {{imminent}} attack by the <b>Morality</b> <b>Squad.</b> After a tough battle, GWAR emerge victorious over the <b>Morality</b> <b>Squad.</b> Later, the giant T-Rex, Gor-Gor, is born and begins attempting to destroy the world. GWAR then engage in another battle with their tyrannic offspring, eventually killing it as well. The movie fades out as the Cuttlefish of Cthulhu is happily reunited with Oderus Urungus.|$|E
50|$|Religious police, {{for example}} islamic {{religious}} police units or sharia police {{in certain parts}} of the Arab-speaking world, are <b>morality</b> <b>squads</b> that also monitors for example dress codes, observance of store-closures during prayer time, consumption of unlawful beverages or foods, unrelated males and females socializing, and homosexual behavior.|$|R
50|$|Jin, {{leader of}} the Seventh Public <b>Morality</b> Enforcement <b>Squad,</b> resembles Sōma Ōgami in Kannazuki no Miko but has a less-forthright {{personality}} and seems more concerned with Academia than its inhabitants.|$|R
50|$|Sōjirō, the second-oldest {{child in}} the Ayanokōji family, is a muscular, heavily-scarred man. Despite Tarlotte's abuse, he is {{concerned}} about her well-being and expresses pity for the Absolute Angels. Unlike his siblings, Sōjirō seems peaceful and thoughtful. Jin Ōgami reveals that before his association with Tarlotte, Sōjirō commanded the <b>Morality</b> Enforcement <b>Squad.</b> After Kazuya kidnaps Tarlotte, he enlists the squad to retrieve the Absolute Angels.|$|R
5000|$|Fernand Dufresnse, {{the chief}} of police, {{publicly}} denounced and fired Captain Arthur Taché, {{the head of the}} <b>Morality</b> <b>squad</b> (the police division which was in charge of dealing with institutionalized vice within the city), in order to avoid a judicial inquiry into the matter. [...] Shortly after Taché was fired, Dufresne hired Pacifique “Pax” Plante, a not very well known lawyer, to lead the <b>Morality</b> <b>Squad.</b> Plante would lead a crusade against organized crime and institutionalized vice in Montreal. Even after he was fired from his position as head of the <b>Morality</b> <b>Squad</b> in 1948, he continued to target vice and organized crime through his newspaper column, “Sous le règne de la pègre” in Le Devoir.Plante worked in conjunction with Gérald Pelletier writing daily articles for Le Devoir with the intent to inform and mobilize the public against organized crime. Consequently, his articles drew massive public support and resulted in an increase in public demands to end vice within the city. By 1950 it had become clear that the public were willing to back Plante in his crusade against corruption. In 1950 he teamed up with Jean Drapeau to launch the Caron Inquiry, the city’s largest inquiry of the twentieth century on organized crime.|$|E
50|$|In office, {{he formed}} an {{alliance}} with future mayor Joseph Clarke (then an alderman) against {{those who wanted to}} drive prostitution and gambling out of the city. McNamara fired both the police chief {{and the head of the}} <b>morality</b> <b>squad.</b> His alliance with Clarke ended when the two came to blows in a meeting of Edmonton City Council.|$|E
5000|$|The {{film has}} a fairly crude and unfocused plot, {{but the movie}} {{essentially}} tells the tale of Gwar's conflict with the <b>Morality</b> <b>Squad,</b> after the theft of Oderus Urungus' [...] "Cuttlefish of Cthulhu" [...] (or penis). In the mean time, GWAR is called to New York City to shoot a commercial for [...] "GWAR cereal", a cornflake-like food that is sprinkled with cocaine rather than sugar, thus turning kids into addicts.|$|E
50|$|A vice squad, {{also called}} a vice unit or a <b>morality</b> <b>squad,</b> is (though not always) a police division, whose focus is to {{restrain}} or suppress moral crimes. Though {{what is considered}} or accepted as a moral crime by society often varies considerably according to local laws or customs between nations, countries, or states, it often includes activities such as gambling, narcotics, pornography, and illegal sales of alcoholic beverages. Vice squads do not concentrate on crimes like fraud and murder.|$|E
50|$|Father Bohab {{was never}} {{actually}} on the album—he originally appeared in 1989, along with an early Cardinal Syn. On the Tour de Scum (the corresponding tour to Scumdogs of the Universe, the <b>Morality</b> <b>Squad</b> story is introduced. He (Bohab) is played {{by one of the}} slaves (according to Chuck Varga’s Bohab Central forum posts, it was Bob Gorman; he also {{went on to say that}} the voice was his) on tour, but is portrayed by Brad Roberts (Jizmak Da Gusha) in Phallus in Wonderland and It's Sleazy.|$|E
5000|$|On December 1, 1886, Grasett was {{appointed}} Chief Constable of Toronto. During his {{command of the}} Toronto Police he saw the force grow from 172 to 662 men. Under Grasett, the police remained largely British and Protestant in composition. Patrolmen were armed {{for the first time}} under Grasett. He also oversaw innovations such as the institution of an electric call box and signal system, patrol wagons, bicycles, motorcycles and ultimately police cars and also reorganized the <b>morality</b> <b>squad</b> and department of detectives. Training and promotion was modelled on the military.|$|E
50|$|As the <b>Morality</b> <b>Squad</b> {{prepares for}} their attack on GWAR, their {{religious}} representative, Father Bohab, is convicted {{of child molestation}} and sodomy of a twelve-year-old choirboy. Despite the clear evidence of Bohab's crimes, the Squad feel he was framed by GWAR (particularly by the band's manager, Sleazy P. Martini, {{who took part in}} exposing him); he is later released and the charges are dropped. Later, while Bohab is picketing against GWAR along with other protestors, GWAR and Sleazy brutally attack the crowd, culminating in the disembowelment of Bohab and him being sodomized with his own cross.|$|E
50|$|It is {{explained}} from old entries at Gwar.net that Techno {{was responsible for}} sending the <b>Morality</b> <b>Squad</b> after Gwar, and that he summoned Cardinal Syn, who in turn dispatched Skulhedface. Using Techno's genitalia as a plug, Gwar was able to broadcast Slave Pit TV everywhere, and killed enough people to awaken the World Maggot, but were stopped by Skulhedface. With Skulhedface defeated, Techno tricked Gwar into thinking the year 1996 {{was in fact the}} year 1999 (the reason the tour was called RagNaRok N' Roll 1999), and thus, according to prophecy, the world was about to end with the coming of the comet RagNaRok. It was, in fact, not a comet, but Cardinal Syn. Gwar had to free Techno in order to defeat him.|$|E
5000|$|On October 27, 1969, a {{small group}} of {{professional}} actors, directors, and designers known as the Gallimaufry Players began a two-week run of Michael McClure's The Beard at Davie Street's Riverqueen theatre. The play, about an imaginary encounter between Billy the Kid and Jean Harlow, was replete with expletives and ended with a scene of simulated cunnilingus. [...] On November 5, plainclothes members of the Vancouver City Police <b>morality</b> <b>squad</b> attended the performance. The following day, three members of the Gallimaufry Players and the two proprietors of the Riverqueen were criminally charged with presenting an obscene performance. [...] All five defendants were convicted at trial on May 28, 1971 in the Provincial Court of Vancouver and fined a total of $1,250.|$|E
5000|$|The {{arrest was}} {{written into the}} Oderus Urungus mythology. Oderus attracts trouble {{wherever}} he goes, including one instance where, according to the storyline of Gwar's America Must Be Destroyed album and Phallus in Wonderland movie, Corporal Punishment of The <b>Morality</b> <b>Squad</b> ambushes and detaches his (Oderus's) alleged penis, the Cuttlefish of Cthulhu. This is detailed in the song [...] "Ham On The Bone" [...] (although the song predates the event in question {{by more than a}} year, it fits the context of the story perfectly). Since that incident, Oderus had {{made it a point to}} appear with the Cuttlefish whenever possible (though some tours downplayed the [...] "fish", Gwar's more recent tours had utilized a re-designed Cuttlefish as a means to spray the audience with various fluids).|$|E
5000|$|Techno Destructo {{is behind}} {{all of the}} major assaults on Gwar since his {{enslavement}} in 1991 - attracting the attention of the <b>Morality</b> <b>Squad,</b> summoning Cardinal Syn, who in turn dispatched Skulhedface, confusing the band into thinking the year was 1999 (rather than 1996), so that they would think the coming of Cardinal Syn was, in fact, the comet RagNaRok, and the slave revolts. Though they all ended in failure, he has yet another plan - genetically modify abused (by Gwar) penguins into his army, hypnotize Slymenstra Hymen with radioactive crack cocaine, and marry her (to spite Oderus Urungus). Techno builds a robot clone of Sleazy P. Martini, and uses him to distribute the crack, while the band beats up penguins (in their time-honored sport of [...] "Penguin-Booting").|$|E
5000|$|He {{used his}} {{position}} in the legislature to become a thorn {{in the side of}} the Tory governments led by John Robarts and Bill Davis. He asked provocative questions in the legislature and was known for stunts, such as selling the book The Happy Hooker out of his office after it had been banned by the Toronto Police <b>morality</b> <b>squad</b> — he offered MPPs a 10 percent discount. Once, to make a point about lax security, he carried a pellet gun — dressed up to look like a submachine gun — in a bag through an Ontario nuclear plant, and then pulled it out on the floor of the Legislature. He waved it around happily while cabinet ministers sitting across from him hid under their desks. He wrote the book [...] "MPP" [...] to describe his experiences, one of at least three autobiographies that he wrote.Shulman demanded that he be appointed Attorney General if the NDP ever won government. NDP leader Stephen Lewis refused to commit to making such a promise. After clashing with his colleagues in the NDP — particularly Lewis — Shulman decided to leave the legislature and did not run in the 1975 election.|$|E
5000|$|The lyrical {{content in}} America Must Be Destroyed was greatly {{inspired}} by Dave Brockie’s fight with police officers while touring in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1990. The controversy revolved around Brockie’s rubbery penis adornment {{and ended with}} him being arrested on charges disseminating obscenity. Brockie was revolted by this attack on his rights and so he created a concept album revolving around an elite [...] "Morality Squad" [...] that attacked the members of Gwar and stole Oderus’s penile attachment (a.k.a. Cuttlefish of Cthulu, a phallic hell beast that normally dangles from his crotch). The opening song, [...] "Ham on the Bone" [...] (which has a nod to grindcore) explains this robbery. The story then shifts to Gwar headquarters in Antarctica, where Oderus’s slaves are ordered to shoot up a dinosaur egg with crack. The result is the mighty Gor Gor, a Tyrannosaurus Rex that wreaks havoc on America. Meanwhile, the <b>Morality</b> <b>Squad</b> has {{enlisted the help of}} Father Bohab (a Catholic priest) to crucify Gwar in the media. Other songs of interest include [...] "Have You Seen Me?", [...] "Poor Ole Tom", and [...] "The Road Behind". A video, Phallus in Wonderland, was released as a supplement to the album’s storyline. This album was followed by The Road Behind, an EP that contained that single and a live version of [...] "Have You Seen Me?’ (which contained a notorious Ween sample at the end). The single [...] "S.F.W." [...] (a staple of their live shows) was supposedly released on this album as a bonus track, but this has been discounted by the band.|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} is furnished for the Bureau for information purposes {{in regard to}} Interstate Transportation of Obscene Matters in St. Louis. Sergeant X of the St. Louis Police Department <b>Morality</b> <b>Squad</b> was contacted concerning the arrest of several persons for allegedly offering obscene literature for sale. Sergeant X advised that the following persons, owners and operators of news stands, had been arrested, during March, April and May 1956 and charged with, 2 ̆ 2 Possession of Obscene literature with intent to sell or display to a minor, 2 ̆ 2 in violation of city ordinance: Sergeant X advised that the persons arrested and indicted had been in possession of the magazines named, 2 ̆ 2 CONFIDENTIAL 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 BRONZE THRILLS. 2 ̆ 2 Numerous other books and magazines were confiscated and turned over to X legal adviser to the Board of Review for Juvenile Readers, of the City of St. Louis and of the City Counselor 2 ̆ 7 s Office...|$|E
40|$|This project recreates {{the real-life}} events {{surrounding}} Harry Davis’s murder in July of 1946. Davis, the kingpin of Montreal’s underworld, functioned as an intermediary between the city’s organized crime and corrupt city officials. His murder by fellow mobster Joe Miller provoked {{a period of}} civic and legal reform, starting with the hiring of the incorruptible Pacifique “Pax” Plante as Chief of police {{and head of the}} special unit known as the <b>Morality</b> <b>Squad.</b> The unit had been designed to take down the city’s organized crime, but served {{as little more than a}} pretense to appease upright taxpayers. After decades of cooperation and payoffs between the police, politicians and the underworld, civic unrest lead Plante to step in to cleanse both the city and the police department of immoral and illegal activities, vowing to shine a light on the “Feydeau farce” that was the judicial system. Plante’s hiring, however, soon proved to be yet another pretense, as he was quickly relieved of his position, restoring the balance of power to corruption and profiteering...|$|E
