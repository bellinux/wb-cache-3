[...] In a centenary tribute in The Times Gerald Larner commented that Poulenc's prediction was wrong, and that in 1999 the composer was widely celebrated for both sides of his musical character: [...] "both the fervent Catholic and the naughty boy, for both the Gloria and Les Biches, both Les Dialogues des Carmélites and Les Mamelles de Tirésias." [...] At around the same time the writer Jessica Duchen described Poulenc as [...] "a fizzing, bubbling mass of Gallic energy who can <b>move</b> <b>you</b> to both laughter and tears within seconds. His language speaks clearly, directly and humanely to every generation." ...|$|E

Rajani Chandel of The Times of India asserted that it [...] "will <b>move</b> <b>you</b> to tears", while The Huffington Post India editor Ankur Pathak noted the leading duo's [...] "effortlessly comfortable vibe", and dubbed the trailer [...] "lovely".

It had its theatrical release on 27 May 2016 in India.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene where}} Beyoncé is pictured {{wrecking}} a shelf of trophies [...] "represent knocking down... beauty standards and {{falling into a}} victim of that". The scene was inspiried by Matsoukas obtaining an image of Beyoncé, during her youth, pictured afront a shelf of her personal trophies. Matsoukas opined that [...] " [...] don't bring you happiness, and don't <b>move</b> <b>you</b> forward in life". Jake Reed of The Daily Collegian interpreted the scene as a realization that the pressure of sustaining beauty is unworthy {{of the time and}} dedication spent on it. Beyoncé was styled by B. Akerlund for the music video. Her wardrobe included a 1920s rabbit ear headpiece as a means of innocence for her character in the clip. Her look was honed with a [...] "We Are Handsome"-print bodysuit and a Dolce & Gabbana gold brace corset, as well as a tiara and sash during other scenes.|$|E

[...] Writing for Exclaim!, Daryl Keating called the album [...] "a real testament to the tenacity of the Avalanches, and one we're truly grateful for." [...] Tim Sendra of AllMusic felt that Wildflower [...] "falls short of expectations, but still ends up being a pretty good album anyway" [...] and considered the abundance of guest performers, {{with the exception of}} Jonathan Donahue, to be unnecessary, concluding that the group [...] "ended up making the best psychedelic Chemical Brothers album ever instead of making another classic Avalanches album." [...] Emily MacKay of NME was less favourable, asking how [...] "something that took so long [...] sound so, well, meh," [...] and ultimately called the album [...] "a faded snapshot of a cosier, very distant-seeming past." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{review in}} Hit Parader praised the album for [...] "probably [...] more a cappella harmony than on any album {{since the fall}} of the singing-group era in the late 1950s", but that they [...] "still like Pet Sounds better." [...] NME wrote of the album: [...] "By the {{standards}} which this group has set itself, it's more than a grade disappointing." [...] Hi Fidelity said: [...] "...they are making the psychedelic route... perhaps in the unforgettable city of Fresno. Until they reach the San Francisco Bay Bridge or return to the shores of Malibu... their work can only receive partial approval." [...] Rolling Stone referred to it as a [...] "disaster" [...] and an [...] "abortive attempt to match the talents of Lennon and McCartney." [...] On December 14, 1967, the magazine's editor and co-founder Jann Wenner printed an influential article that denounced Wilson's [...] "genius" [...] label, which he called a [...] "promotional shuck", and the Beach Boys themselves, which he called [...] "one prominent example of a group that has gotten hung up on trying to catch The Beatles." [...] He wrote that [...] "for some reason, [...] just doesn't make it ... just don't <b>move</b> <b>you.</b> Other than displaying Brian Wilson's virtuosity for production, they are pointless." ...|$|E

Brent DiCrescenzo of Pitchfork Media remarked that the song [...] "tenderly glides down throats like lithium." [...] While commenting that Play [...] "need of a bit of pruning", David Browne of Entertainment Weekly cited [...] "Porcelain" [...] as an exception and praised it as [...] "gorgeous". In their [...] "Chartslot" [...] feature, the Daily Record described the song as [...] "ideal for chilling out to on a summer's evening." [...] Jim DeRogatis of the Chicago Sun-Times characterized the Play songs [...] "Honey" [...] and [...] "Porcelain" [...] as [...] "emotional and gripping" [...] and wrote that if [...] " [...] didn't <b>move</b> <b>you</b> (in {{every sense of the}} word), then you probably had no pulse." [...] Playlouder named [...] "Porcelain" [...] the twenty-sixth best single of 2000, calling it the album's [...] "most crushingly heavenly track" [...] and praising its combination of piano melodies with Moby's [...] "hauntingly haunted" [...] vocals. The song ranked at number fifty-six on The Village Voices annual Pazz & Jop critics' poll. Q placed [...] "Porcelain" [...] at number 253 on their list of the 1,001 Best Songs Ever.|$|E

And the communal experience, the chemistry that you get between actors and audience can be extraordinary. It can <b>move</b> <b>you</b> in a way that film can't. That's the power of theatre at its best." [...] The role that he would most like to play is Macbeth; other roles on his wish-list include Iago in Othello, Brick in Tennessee Williams' Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Lenny in Harold Pinter's The Homecoming, and Hamlet [...] "as long as no one gives it to me because it's completely daunting".|$|E

Beliefnet called the song [...] "stirring", while Hal Hinson of The Washington Post considers it {{to be among the}} film's best. Roger Moore of the Chicago Tribune referred to [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] as a [...] "brilliant" [...] song that [...] "can <b>move</b> <b>you</b> to tears," [...] while James Berardinelli of ReelViews cited it among the film's most [...] "memorable" [...] songs. Anthony Quinn of The Independent highlighted [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] as the film's best song, going on to praise Lansbury's [...] "magnificent" [...] performance, while the Deseret News Chris Hicks called it [...] "beautiful." [...] Simon Brew of Den of Geek specifically enjoyed the lyrics [...] "bittersweet and strange, finding you can change," [...] describing the song as [...] "superb." [...] Lansbury's vocal performance has also been singled out for praise: Slant Magazines Jaime N. Christley wrote that Lansbury [...] "delivers the film's title tune, gooey treacle that it is, like nobody's business." [...] Describing the song as [...] "beautiful", the Chicago Tribunes Gene Siskel wrote that [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] is [...] "performed poignantly by the richly textured voice of Angela Lansbury." [...] Similarly, PopMatters' Bill Gibron penned, [...] "the moment Angela Lansbury’s trite teapot steps up to sing the title song, all dry eye bets are off." [...] The New York Posts Lou Lumenick wrote that [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] was [...] "unforgettably delivered by Angela Lansbury." [...] Aylin Zara of BuzzFeed opined that Lansbury's version is superior to the single, penning, [...] "Though the commercial pop version of 'Beauty and the Beast,' sung by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson, is great, the film version — performed by Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Potts — is even better. Tender and warm ... it tugs at all the right heartstrings to get your eyes a little misty." [...] Rachael Monaco of AXS cited [...] "Tale as old as time. Tune as old as song. Bittersweet and strange. Finding you can change. Learning you were wrong. Certain as the sun rising in the East. Tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme, Beauty and the Beast" [...] as the film's best lyric.

2500|$|While the bus {{was leaving}} San Fernando, the bus driver saw at a {{distance}} that there were several trucks blocking the highway up ahead, {{and that there were}} several men wearing ski-masks and holding AR-15s. The gunmen ordered the bus to stop, and the bus driver obeyed. The cartel members approached the bus pointing their guns and yelling, [...] "Open the door, asshole! <b>Move,</b> <b>you</b> son of a bitch, unless you want me to shoot you dead." [...] The chauffeur, trembling, opened the door for the gunmen, who quickly stormed the bus as soon as the door was opened. [...] "You are all fucked," [...] yelled one of the gunmen to the people on board; the passengers were frightened, and some of them cried, thinking it was simply a regular armed robbery. But {{that was not the case}} this time. The cartel members then ordered the bus driver to drive the bus deep into a dirt road for about ten kilometers before reaching a plain area, [...] "in the middle of nowhere." [...] In the area there were about twenty luxurious trucks and three passenger buses, some of them with bullet holes, flat tires, and broken windows. The driver was then ordered to stop the bus, and all the men were then told to descend from the vehicle. They were asked to form a line, and the cartel members began to organize them from youngest to oldest and from strongest to weakest. Those who looked old or weak were separated from the group, tied from their feet, and then taken elsewhere. Those who were left were ordered to take off their shirts and remain where they were. A man wearing black military uniform, a bulletproof vest, and a kit belt was called from the trucks that were parked nearby. All of the triggermen referred to him as Commander 40, better known as Miguel Treviño Morales, one of the top leaders of Los Zetas. The man approached the passengers that were lined up in front of him, and said in an energetic voice: [...] "Let's see, assholes. Who wants to live?" [...] But no one answered. One teenager accidentally wet himself out of nervousness, and Commander 40 killed him with a shot to the head. Treviño Morales then yelled: [...] "I will ask all of you one more time. Who the fuck wants to live?" [...] All of the men raised their hands. [...] "Good. We will test your abilities to see how capable you are. If you make it, you'll survive; if you do not, you're fucked." [...] Commander 40 then asked his henchmen to bring the bats and clubs, and each of the passengers was given one. He then said, [...] "Look, each of you will get in pairs and beat the shit out of each other. Those who survive will work for Los Zetas, those who don't, well, they're fucked." [...] All of the passengers were shocked at the order the individual in front of them gave them. Everyone got their bats and clubs, joined up as a pair, and stared at their partners nervously. Treviño Morales then said: [...] "Now beat the shit out of each other." ...|$|E
