500|$|Before the fight, sports writers {{considered}} Gomez a tough opponent for Khan, {{with his}} [...] "knockout punch" [...] and his success against Alex Arthur in similar circumstances, despite having lost {{three of his}} last six fights. Gomez saw the fight {{as an opportunity to}} reignite his career; in an interview shortly before the fight he spoke of how [...] "his fight really is my last chance to set myself up for life and become known in every household in Britain". At the same time, he reflected on the positive effects of his career in the ring, saying [...] "Boxing kept my feet on the ground and gave me a focus.

He continued, [...] "Whenever I came back, I was excited to come back, and the scenes all seemed pretty amazing. I was so happy to re-embrace the character." [...] According to Parkinson, he was sorry that Rickon would die but his manner of death was a compensation: [...] "It was a cool death, and it was {{always going to be a}} good death, so at the same time, I was pretty happy." ...|$|E
500|$|Once Upon the Time co-creator Adam Horowitz {{said that}} his {{earliest}} Disney memory was seeing a re-release of Disney's Snow White when he was [...] "terrified by the Evil Queen while also being unable to look away and that stuck with <b>me</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> years." [...] Similarly, fashion designer and Angelina Jolie's Maleficent collaborator Stella McCartney said: [...] "My favorite Disney film was Snow White. I remember growing up watching [...] and being completely freaked out by that scene where the evil queen becomes the old witch and she makes the poison apple." [...] Film maker and actor Terry Gilliam listed the film's Queen among his eight favourite villains, commenting how [...] "truly strange" [...] is that [...] "vanity and beauty are what she's all about, yet the identity she assumes when she becomes the old beggar woman is practically the ugliest in all the kingdom." [...] Fairy tale lecturer Jack Zipes alike noted that [...] "it is somewhat strange that the queen believes the mirror, for the picture of Snow White reveals {{that she is a}} pretty pubescent red-cheeked ordinary girl while the queen is a stunning beautiful mature woman who might easily win a beauty contest." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviews of Mysteries of Westgate were mixed. 1UP.com's Jason Wilson {{said that}} the game's plot is [...] "an {{intriguing}} tale, and even after finishing the game, a number of encounters and plot points ring in my head ... but the story's poor stitching distracts from its arc—I felt like a great hand ... was pushing <b>me</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> plot, and the tale felt a bit muddled toward the end." [...] Brett Todd of GameSpot called the plot [...] "rough around the edges", while GameZone reviewer Michael Lafferty said, [...] "The game may have a disjointed storyline, but there are moments where humor shines through, and the game does take a few interesting plot twists. And {{the exploration of the}} city zones, the underground areas where the trolls abound, hold that sense of joyful discovery that make an RPG worth playing." [...] Numerous reviewers mentioned that the impact of the mask which drives the story is minimal, having little effect on the actual gameplay. Lafferty said the side quests were not necessarily optional, as they were often a source of additional gold, and a certain point in the game's plot required a substantial sum of it to proceed. GamesRadar's Rich McCormick praised the game's storyline and main quest as some of its best points. In a review for GameStar, Christian Schmidt thought that the game's appearance and humor were poor, but recommended it because of its strong storyline.|$|E
500|$|In September 2011, Delia is {{rushed to}} {{hospital}} after spiking a high temperature of 105, {{where she is}} diagnosed with leukemia, devastating Chloe. SoapNet noted that [...] "Chloe's world is turned upside down" [...] {{as a result of}} the diagnosis. The leukemia storyline spans into January 2012. Hendrickson was happy with the storyline, stating that [...] "it was my supporting actors who supported <b>me</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> entire shooting day, and the writing. It was just all wrapped up in a neat little package. I could not ask for a better show." [...] Delia needs a bone marrow transplant to survive. Billy is being forced away from town by his wife's father Victor Newman (Eric Braeden). Victor arranges for Billy to secretly be able to donate his bone marrow, saving Delia's life, though he passes the donation off as Kevin's. Hendrickson praised the writing for the storyline as a [...] "full arc" [...] which had a [...] "beginning, middle and an end". She said, [...] "It was a great story. I got to show a lot of range, and also got to work with some great supporting actors who were in those scenes." [...] For the 39th Daytime Emmy Awards, Hendrickson submitted the scenes in which Chloe is informed of Delia's leukemia, which allowed her to receive a nomination in the category of Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. In July 2013, Delia has a health scare. In light of Chloe's marriage to Kevin ending and Billy experiencing troubles in his marriage to Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle), Jamey Giddens of Zap2it observed that this could act as a catalyst towards a [...] "Chilly" [...] (Chloe and Billy) reunion, writing, [...] "The perfect storm of two failing marriages and a sick child seems to be conjuring up the right elements for some Chilly weather in Genoa City." ...|$|E

Though greatly crushed by the final outcome of our struggle, I felt proud that I had been permitted to do my part, and even to suffer for the cause I loved.

2500|$|In October 1946, the twice married Pasternak met Olga Ivinskaya, a 34 {{year old}} single mother {{employed}} by Novy Mir. Deeply moved by her resemblance {{to his first}} love Ida Vysotskaya, Pasternak gave Ivinskaya several volumes of his poetry and literary translations. Although Pasternak never left his wife Zinaida, he started an extramarital relationship with Ivinskaya that would last {{for the remainder of}} Pasternak's life. Ivinskaya later recalled, [...] "He phoned almost every day and, instinctively fearing to meet or talk with him, yet dying of happiness, I would stammer out that I was [...] "busy today." [...] But almost every afternoon, toward the end of working hours, he came in person to the office and often walked with <b>me</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> streets, boulevards, and squares all the way home to Potapov Street.

2500|$|After {{listening}} to Rice-Oxley's piano playing during a weekend at Virginia Water, Surrey in 1997, Chris Martin {{invited him to}} join his newly formed band Coldplay. However, Rice-Oxley declined {{because he did not}} want to leave [...] "The Lotus Eaters", stating, [...] "I was seriously interested, but Keane were already operational and Coldplay's keyboard player idea was dropped." [...] Because of Martin's offer, and although Hughes and Scott were originally opposed to it, Chaplin joined the band in 1997, taking Rice-Oxley's place as vocalist and adding himself as the acoustic guitarist. Chaplin's recruitment also marked a change of name from [...] "The Lotus Eaters" [...] to [...] "Cherry Keane", after a friend of Chaplin's mother, whom Rice-Oxley and Chaplin knew when they were young. She took care of them and would tell them to go for their dreams. At her death from cancer, she had left money for Chaplin's family. Chaplin commented: [...] "I used some of the money to see <b>me</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> harder times with the music." [...] The name was shortened to Keane soon afterward.|$|E
2500|$|I think Walter is {{a writer}} at heart. Writers aren't always that good at {{communicating}} in person. He's also a tough son-of-a-bitch. He's like a cowboy. His director's chair was made out of leather and {{on the back of}} it read [...] "Lone Wolf". [...] He used to frequent gun clubs and he wasn't a very delicate guy.... We were doing a love scene. When they said, [...] "We need to ADR the love scene." [...] I really freaked out. I had never done a love scene before... I really needed help to get through it. I panicked, and the Producer... Joel Silver, called Walter and somehow persuaded him to come over and direct <b>me</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ADR. Streets of Fire was a big picture for me, and I was overwhelmed. I think that bothered Walter. I think he thought that I was a needy guy. He was used to working with actors who had experience like Nick Nolte or David Carradine. I've always wondered why Walter has never wanted to work with me again. I think he was too much of gentlemen to tell me that I was too needy at the time.|$|E
