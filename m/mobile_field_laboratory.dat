40|$|The thermal {{performance}} of a solar field is measured to rate its overall quality. Therefore, it is typically used as a criterion during phases of commissioning and acceptance. The present paper introduces a novel apporach toward effective testing and evaluation of commercial parabolic trough solar fields during regular dynamic operation conditions. This includes measurement specifications, advanced evaluation of performance data, yielding characteristic performance parameters and their uncertainties, as well as probabilistic simulation of long-term yields. The apporach of advanced acceptance testing and modeling (ATM) is described and applied to demonstrate the implication of measurement equipment on {{the significance of the}} results. Three exemplary measurement scenarios are compared. The predicted uncertainties of a reference scenario, a <b>mobile</b> <b>field</b> <b>laboratory</b> and built-in sensors amount to 2. 0 %, 4. 0 % and 4. 5 % of the annual yield respectiviely. They illustrate the advantages of the <b>mobile</b> <b>field</b> <b>laboratory</b> compared to the use of built-in sensor equipment and demonstrate the limitations in view of minimum test and prediction uncertainty...|$|E

40|$|The {{mixing of}} liquids {{is a common}} {{operation}} in process industries such as chemical and pharmaceutical industries. However the problem of mixing different liquids has not been rigorously characterized yet. Therefore one of the aims of this PhD thesis was focused on mixing in microsystems, like microcapillaries and micromixers. Microfluidic systems, fabricated by utilizing silicone, biomaterials, or stainless steel, have gathered enormous attention in the recent years. Compared to industrial laboratory equipment, these microsystems offer reduced reagent consumption, more safety and lower time for analysis. Their reduced size makes them suitable for <b>mobile</b> <b>field</b> <b>laboratories,</b> while their reduced cost allows them to be disposable after sensitive applications. Microsystems fit perfectly with the Process Intensification (PI) strategy, an engineering expression that refers to making changes that render a manufacturing or processing design substantially improved in terms of energy efficiency, cost-effectiveness or enhancement of other qualities. The design of microfluidic systems often requires unusual geometries and the interplay of multiple physical effects such as pressure gradients and capillarity, which lead to interesting variants of well-studied fluid dynamical problems and some new fluid responses. The rapidly increasing interest in the application and control of emulsions in microfluidics devices for industrial biotechnological purposes motivates this research. In particular emulsification process to form stable samples over time by using different techniques was investigated. Fluid dynamic behavior of a stable oil-in-water emulsion was characterized in microcapillaries and contrast-enhanced optical microscopy was used for direct observation and automated image analysis algorithms {{have been developed to}} characterize the velocity and the deformability of drops flowing in capillaries of micrometric dimensions. Fundamental understanding of emulsification process is very important from a biotechnological point of view because it is present in many biological processes. For example the motion of droplets under confined flow has attracted some interest due to the similarities with the shape taken by red blood cells in microcapillaries. Furthermore emulsification process in micro static mixers of different diameter and length was analyzed and theoretical models to predict emulsion particle size distribution were performed. Finally scale-up of these microreactors was performed...|$|R

40|$|The nees@UCLA <b>mobile</b> <b>field</b> <b>laboratory</b> was {{utilized}} {{to collect data}} from forced and ambient vibration testing of a four-story RC building damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Both low amplitude broadband and moderate amplitude harmonic excitation were applied using a linear shaker and two eccentric mass shakers, respectively, and ambient vibrations were measured before and after each forced vibration test. Accelerations, interstory displacements, and curvature distributions were monitored using accelerometers, LVDTs and concrete strain gauges. Natural frequencies and the associated mode shapes for the first 7 modes were identified. Fundamental frequencies determined from the eccentric mass shaker tests were 70 % to 75 % of the values determined using ambient vibration data, and 92 % to 93 % of the values determined using the linear shaker test data. Larger frequency drops were observed in the NS direction of the building, apparently due to damage that was induced during the Northridge earthquake...|$|E

Both low amplitude broadband and moderate amplitude harmonic excitation were applied using a linear shaker and two eccentric mass shakers, respectively. Floor accelerations, interstory displacements, and column and slab curvature distributions were monitored during the tests using accelerometers, linear variable differential transformers (LVDTs) and concrete strain gauges. The use of dense instrumentation enabled veriﬁcation of common modeling assumptions related to rigid diaphragms and soil-structure-interaction. The ﬁrst six or seven natural frequencies, mode shapes, and damping ratios were identiﬁed. Signiﬁcant decreases in frequency cor responded to increases in shaking amplitude, most notably in the N-S direction of the building, most likely due to preexisting diagonal joint cracks that formed during the Northridge earthquake.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} assesses the procedures and conditions for parabolic trough solar field performance testing. It aims at criteria and guidance for solar field acceptance tests {{that lead to}} representative performance parameters {{on the basis of}} which its future (annual) yield can be predicted. It comprises the specification of test requirements in terms of measurement equipment and test conditions in view of an identification of parameters with minimum uncertainty. A new parameterised dynamic solar field performance model is developed and validated on the basis of annual performance data generated using a detailed dynamic solar field model and meteorological data. The parameters of this new performance model comprise the basic geometry of the field, heat capacity of the headers and mean performance characteristics of installed collectors such as optical efficiency, heat loss factor, heat capacity and incident angle modifier (IAM) parameters. These performance parameters are identified from test data by means of numerical optimisation including an assessment of their uncertainties. A systematic investigation of the influence of test data on the values of identified parameters leads to basic data selection criteria in terms of required temperature levels, ranges of incident angles and irradiance level ensuring the representativeness of parameters. An assessment of the three exemplary test scenarios of a high precision test facility, a <b>mobile</b> <b>field</b> <b>laboratory</b> and a set of built-in sensors yields combined measured uncertainties of ± 1. 8...|$|E
