According to Twitter. com, there have been noticeable spikes of twitter usage during disasters and other large events, serving as an extremely powerful and effective fast response news service. This raises some important exploratory questions: What kind of information can <b>micro-blogging</b> provide regarding disaster news? Of what quality is the information provided by <b>micro-blogging?</b> Can the modern communication tool – <b>micro-blogging,</b> replace the mainstream media information channel or merely supplement it in distributing disaster news?

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a dynamic model to {{identify}} influential users of <b>micro-blogging</b> services. <b>Micro-blogging</b> services, such as Twitter, allow their users (twitterers) to publish tweets and choose to follow other users to receive tweets. Previous work on user influence on Twitter, concerns more on following link structure and the contents user published, seldom {{emphasizes the importance of}} interactions among users. We argue that, by emphasizing on user actions in <b>micro-blogging</b> platform, user influence could be measured more accurately. Since <b>micro-blogging</b> is a powerful social media and communication platform, identifying influential users according to user interactions has more practical meanings, e. g., advertisers may concern how many actions – buying, in this scenario – the influential users could initiate rather than how many advertisements they spread. By introducing the idea of PageRank algorithm, innovatively, we propose our model using action-based network which could capture the ability of influential users when they interacting with <b>micro-blogging</b> platform. Taking the evolving prosperity of <b>micro-blogging</b> into consideration, we extend our actionbaseduser influence model into a dynamic one, which could distinguish influential users in different time periods.

30|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} an increasing {{interest in the}} domain of <b>micro-blogs</b> such as Twitter, Facebook, and Sina Weibo. Since <b>micro-blogs</b> possess unique characteristics of limited length, ambiguous/error-prone, rich of acronyms, slangs, and flexible and novel usages, these would hinder the exploitation of sentiment analysis techniques (Liu 2012) in general. Additionally, different genres that appear in the social media (such as blogs, message boards, news, and <b>micro-blogs)</b> have brought different levels of difficulties for the analysts. To date, there has been little work on sentiment detection using Chinese <b>micro-blogs.</b> In the study by Yang (2009), F 1 score of 64.8 % was reported by tracing a single Plurker’s post sentiments for a few months; while 77.4 – 81.6 % was presented in Huang et al.

40|$|This paper studies a new {{potential}} social communication phenomenon: social <b>micro-blogging</b> {{without the}} Internet. Social <b>micro-blogs</b> (called utterances) are assumed created on mobile devices and shared between peers using direct wireless transmission {{rather than using}} any network infrastructure. This combines two emerging issues: opportunistic networking architectures are {{making it possible to}} 'store, carry and forward' such content while trends in social media and self expression such as <b>micro-blogging</b> have become increasingly popular. We address the problem of obtaining content of personal interest through social <b>micro-blogging</b> without the Internet. This is a challenging problem because generally speaking, content cannot be pulled from its source on demand. Consequently intelligent techniques are needed that allow content to be pushed between groups of users. We introduce a community-based approach that allows content to be pushed to those who can derive utility from it. We explore the robustness and performance of this approach which builds social networks through which relevant content can be pushed using epidemic-inspired mechanisms...|$|R

In this paper, we analyze the social opinion influence on Tencent, one of the largest <b>Micro-Blogging</b> websites in China, endeavoring to unveil the behavior patterns of Chinese <b>Micro-Blogging</b> users. This paper proposes a Topic-Level Opinion Influence Model (TOIM) that simultaneously incorporates topic factor and social direct influence in a unified probabilistic framework. Based on TOIM, two topic level opinion influence propagation and aggregation algorithms are developed to consider the indirect influence: CP (Conservative Propagation) and NCP (None Conservative Propagation). Users' historical social interaction records are leveraged by TOIM to construct their progressive opinions and neighbors' opinion influence through a statistical learning process, which can be further utilized to predict users' future opinions on some specific topics. To evaluate and test this proposed model, an experiment was designed and a sub-dataset from Tencent <b>Micro-Blogging</b> was used. The experimental results show that TOIM outperforms baseline methods on predicting users' opinion. The applications of CP and NCP have no significant differences and could significantly improve recall and F 1 -measure of TOIM. Comment: PLOS ONE Manuscript Draf...|$|R
