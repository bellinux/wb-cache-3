5|$|At {{the time}} of the Tour, rugby in Scotland was a game of the upper classes, and the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) was very conservative. Their {{officials}} believed the game should remain strictly amateur, and that rugby was for the players, not the spectators. The Scottish were uncomfortable with the public interest in the All Blacks, and did not <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> very welcome. They interpreted a letter sent to them stating that the All Blacks {{did not want to be}} entertained after their match quite literally, and the All Blacks were not invited to the after-match dinner organised by the Scottish Union. As well as this, the SRU refused to grant international caps for the game.|$|E

25|$|Because dogs often bark {{excessively}} due to stress, boredom, or frustration, changing {{aspects of}} an animal's environment {{to make them}} more content is a suitable way to quiet them down, rather than forcibly silencing a distressed animal. Spending more time with an animal, such as playing, walking, and other bonding activities, will keep them occupied and <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> more at ease. If the animal is stressed, it is best to remove the object that is causing them discomfort.|$|E

It is a way for the group members to share the knowledge and the tasks to be fulfilled unfailingly. For example, if Sally and Paul were loafing because they were not given specific tasks, then giving Paul the note taker duty and Sally the brainstorming duty will <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> essential to the group. Sally and Paul will be less likely to want to let the group down, because they have specific obligations to complete.|$|E

In addition to the Jizya the old Sassanid land tax (Known in Arabic as Kharaj) was also adopted. Caliph Umar is said to have occasionally set up a commission to survey the taxes in order to check that they wouldn't be more than the land could bear. It is narrated that Zoroastrians were subjected to humiliation and ridicule when paying the Jizya in order to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> inferior.|$|E

Fifty-two participants {{were randomly assigned to}} either think about a coworker who has made <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> content or a coworker that has made <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> irritated. The findings showed that participants who thought about an irritating coworker not only felt more irritated and less content than their counterparts, but they also ruminated more about the coworker, felt that it would more difficult to work with the coworker, and experienced more negative affect. However, the results showed that there were no differences on cognitive performance between those thinking about a coworker who <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> irritated compared to one who <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> content.

The story was constructed differently than what was popular at the time. There were no villains, violence, or battles between good and evil.

5000|$|... ''''''Appreciative Inquiry'''''' is an {{approach}} that believes, improvement is more engaging when the focus is made on the strengths rather than the weaknesses. People tend to respond to positive statements but react to negative statements that concern them.

AI is a powerful tool {{that can be used}} in the field of Education to enable children discover what is good about them and dream of what they can do with this realization. Children of today are very sensitive and make decisions in haste which sometimes costs them their lives. In such a situation, AI plays a very vital role.|$|R

500|$|The {{team had}} several goals: factions {{should not be}} [...] "locked-in" [...] to certain strategies; players should have {{interesting}} things to do without unbalancing the game, and the factions must be fun to play. The team believed the [...] "coolness" [...] of the Progenitor aliens would determine {{the success or failure}} of Alien Crossfire. They strove to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> significantly different to play, but still compatible with the existing game mechanics. The developers eventually provided the aliens with Battle Ogres, a Planetary survey, non-blind research, and other powers to produce [...] "a nasty and potent race that would take the combined might of humanity to bring them down". Chris Pine modified the AI to account for the additions. The team also used artwork, sound effects, music, and diplomatic text to set the aliens apart. Other than the aliens, the Pirates proved to be the toughest faction to balance because their ocean start gave them huge advantages.|$|E

500|$|WALL-E went undeveloped {{during the}} 1990s partly because Stanton and Pixar were not {{confident}} enough yet {{to have a}} feature length film with a main character that behaved like Luxo Jr. or R2-D2. Stanton explained {{there are two types}} of robots in cinema: [...] "human with metal skin", like the Tin Man, or [...] "machine with function" [...] like Luxo and R2. He found the latter idea [...] "powerful" [...] because it allowed the audience to project personalities onto the characters, as they do with babies and pets: [...] "You're compelled ... you almost can't stop yourself from finishing the sentence 'Oh, I think it likes me! I think it's hungry! I think it wants to go for a walk!'" [...] He added, [...] "We wanted the audience to believe they were witnessing a machine that has come to life." [...] The animators visited recycling stations to study machinery, and also met robot designers, visited NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to study robots, watched a recording of a Mars rover, and borrowed a bomb detecting robot from the San Francisco Police Department. Simplicity was preferred in their performances as giving them too many movements would <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> human.|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{interpreted}} the Telmarines, including Caspian, as being Spanish {{because of their}} pirate origins, which producer Mark Johnson noted made Caspian [...] "a contrast to the lily-white [...] ". Production designer Roger Ford originally wanted the Telmarines to be French, as they had a confrontational history with the English, who are represented by the Pevensies. This was scrapped as the crew were unable to shoot at Pierrefonds Castle, for Miraz's lair, so they went for the Spanish feel. Weta Workshop created masked helmets for their army, and faceplates for the live horses on set. The stunt soldiers wield two-hundred polearms in two different styles, two-hundred rapiers of varying design, over a hundred falchions, two-hundred and fifty shields and fifty-five crossbows. Caspian's own sword is {{a variation of the}} Royal Guard's weapons. Costume designer Isis Mussenden looked to the paintings of El Greco to inspire the Telmarines' costumes. She wanted to use colours that looked [...] "acidic and hot and cool at the same time", unlike the red and gold seen in the Narnian soldiers. Their masked helmets are based on conquistadors and samurai. She visited the armour archives of the Metropolitan Museum of Art for inspiration. An eagle emblem was incorporated into the characters' lairs to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> fascist.|$|E
500|$|Just Cause 2 was {{developed}} by the Swedish Avalanche Studios, with Square Enix London Studios providing additional support. The game's predecessor, Just Cause, was a moderate commercial success and received mixed reviews from critics. The team thought that although it had potential, it was an opportunity missed and described Just Cause 2 as a [...] "sequel waiting to be made". Shortly after the start of development, the team begin analyzing the first game's strengths and weaknesses with the intention of improving it. They wanted to use the large open world to create rewarding quests and missions, dropping the first game's side missions in favor of faction missions, stronghold takeovers and race challenges to increase gameplay density (keeping players occupied, even when simply exploring the world). This density increased the connectivity between the faction and Agency missions. Another goal was to improve the game's combat and artificial intelligence, so action stunts would be easier to perform and the game's tactical element would increase. The team overhauled the artificial intelligence, improving enemy characters' reaction to player action and their environment. The game [...] features a Hybrid Locking System, which make aiming easier, and a real-time destruction system. The team refined the game's driving mechanics to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> more realistic.|$|E
