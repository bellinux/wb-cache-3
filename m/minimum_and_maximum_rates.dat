50|$|Studying jets {{of water}} from a nozzle, Rayleigh (1878, 1896/1926) noted that when a jet {{is in a state}} of conditionally stable {{dynamical}} structure, the mode of fluctuation most likely to grow to its full extent and lead to another state of conditionally stable dynamical structure is the one with the fastest growth rate. In other words, a jet can settle into a conditionally stable state, but it is likely to suffer fluctuation so as to pass to another, less unstable, conditionally stable state. He used like reasoning in a study of Bénard convection. These physically lucid considerations of Rayleigh seem to contain the heart of the distinction between the principles of <b>minimum</b> <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>rates</b> of dissipation of energy and entropy production, which have been developed in the course of physical investigations by later authors.|$|E

Four near-isogenic soybean lines differing for maturity date were planted in microplots infested with a race 5 isolate of H. glycines. Soil temperature was monitored at a depth of 15 cm. Eggs of H. glycines, extracted from cysts collected monthly from each microplot, were used in hatching tests and bioassays to determine dormancy. Egg hatching and second-stage juvenile (J 2) infectivity rates decreased sharply from their highest levels in midsummer (July-August) to a low level by October of each year and remained low (< 10 % hatching and < 0. 2 J 2 /cm root) until May or June of the following year. The patterns of numbers of females and eggs in the bioassays were similar. The decreases were not related to soil temperature and did not differ consistently among soybean isolines. The monophasic changes in all nematode responses with peak midsummer rates suggest that H. glycines produces one primary generation per year in central Missouri.

High concentration of nitrate in food can cause methaemoglobinaemia and {{is recognized as}} carcinogenic. Therefore, accurate determination of nitrate is crucial to ensure consumers’ health. Regularly, nitrate is estimated by colorimetric and HPLC methods. In measurement of nitrate, the efficiency, accuracy, speed and amount of material are important from economical point of view. In this study, the cost of initial investment, staff, consumable material and equipments used by the two methods were calculated and finally Net Present Value (NPV) was estimated for each of them. The rate of interest was considered from 4 until 30 %. According to the results the amount of initial investment, annual cost of staff and consumable materials for colorimetric method were determined as 274000000, 379080000 and 214289130 Rials, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT- Data was {{analyzed}} on {{development of the}} solanaceen fruit crop Cape gooseberry to evaluate how well a classical thermal time model could describe node appearance in different environments. The data used in the analysis were obtained from experiments conducted in Colombia in open fields and greenhouse condition at two locations with different climate. An empirical, non linear segmented model was used to estimate the base temperature and to parameterize the model for simulation of node appearance vs. time. The base temperature (Tb) {{used to calculate the}} thermal time (TT, oCd) for node appearance was estimated to be 6. 29 oC. The slope of the first linear segment was 0. 023 nodes per TT and 0. 008 for the second linear segment. The time at which the slope of node apperance changed was 1039. 5 oCd after transplanting, determined from a statistical analysis of model for the first segment. When these coefficients were used to predict node appearance at all locations, the model successfully fit the observed data (RSME= 2. 1), especially for the first segment where node appearance was more homogeneous than the second segment.

40|$|Abstract Background: Coronary {{artery disease}} is 2 - 3 times {{more common in}} {{diabetic}} individuals. Dietary nitrate/nitrite has beneficial effects in both diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It also has protective effects against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury in healthy animals. However, the effects of nitrate on myocardial IR injury in diabetic rats {{have not yet been}} investigated. Objective: We examined the effects of dietary nitrate on myocardial IR injury in streptozotocin-nicotinamide-induced diabetic rats. Method: Rats were divided into four groups (n= 7 in each group) : control, control+nitrate, diabetes, and diabetes+nitrate. Type 2 diabetes was induced by injection of streptozotocin and nicotinamide. Nitrate (sodium nitrate) was added to drinking water (100 mg/L) for 2 months. The hearts were perfused in a Langendorff apparatus at 2 months and assessed before (baseline) and after myocardial IR for the following parameters: left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), <b>minimum</b> <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>rates</b> of pressure change in the left ventricle (±dP/dt), endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression, and levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and NO metabolites (NOx). Results: Recovery of LVDP and ±dP/dt was lower in diabetic rats versus controls, but almost normalized after nitrate intake. Diabetic rats had lower eNOS and higher iNOS expression both at baseline and after IR, and dietary nitrate restored these parameters to normal values after IR. Compared with controls, heart NOx level was lower in diabetic rats at baseline but was higher after IR. Diabetic rats had higher MDA levels both at baseline and after IR, which along with heart NOx levels decreased following nitrate intake. Conclusion: Dietary nitrate in diabetic rats provides cardioprotection against IR injury by regulating eNOS and iNOS expression and inhibiting lipid peroxidation in the heart...|$|E

Intramuscular and surface electromyographic (EMG) signals were detected from the abductor hallucis muscle of 11 healthy subjects (age 27. 0 ± 3. 7 yr) during electrically elicited cramps. In all, 48 motor units were identified from the intramuscular EMG. These motor units were active for 23. 6 ± 16. 2 s, during which their average discharge rate was 14. 5 ± 5. 1 pulses/s (pps) and their <b>minimum</b> <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>rates</b> were, respectively, 6. 0 ± 0. 8 and 25. 0 ± 8. 0 pps (P < 0. 001). The coefficient of variation for the interspike interval (ISI) was 44. 6 ± 9. 7 % and doublet discharges constituted 4. 1 ± 4. 7 % {{of the total number of}} discharges. In 38 motor units, the SD of the ISI was positively correlated to the mean ISI (R 2 = 0. 37, P < 0. 05). The coherence spectrum between smoothed discharge rates of pairs of motor units showed one significant peak at 1. 4 ± 0. 4 Hz for 29 of the 96 motor unit pairs and two significant peaks at 1. 3 ± 0. 5 and 1. 5 ± 0. 5 Hz for 8 motor unit pairs. The cross-correlation function between pairs of discharge rates showed a significant peak (0. 52 ± 0. 11) in 26 motor unit pairs. In conclusion, motor units active during cramps showed a range of discharge rates similar to that observed during voluntary contractions but larger ISI variability, probably due to large synaptic noise. Moreover, the discharge rates of the active motor units showed common oscillations...|$|E

Comparison between the two species is based on measurements at 15 °C, but a group of C. lavaretus was also monitored at 10 °C. The intensity of routine oxygen consumption was mass-independent in the smallest larvae, but above about 10 mg wet body mass (m) it scaled with an allometry of m~ 0103 in C. lavaretus and m~ 0154 in E. lucius. Routine, <b>minimum</b> <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>rates</b> of metabolism were higher in C. lavaretus than in E. lucius, whereas the mass-specific rate induced by feeding showed a quite different and more complex relationship to species. The mass-specific rate of growth scaled with m~ 0133 (r= 0. 54) in C. lavaretus but with m~ ° 24 (r= 0. 90) in E. lucius. Comparison of five experimental groups, differing from each other with respect to species, type of prey (Artemia nauplii or Rutilus rutilus larvae), experimental temperature and body size, suggested a general pattern of energy partitioning, with 62 ± 3. 7 % of metabolizable food energy being allocated to growth, and 38 ± 3. 7 % to metabolic expenditures. The relationship between metabolic rate and growth rate, expressed as the 'yield ratio', mg dry body mass ^mol^C^, the inverse of the net cost of growth, proved to be nearly invariant in all experimental groups, namely 0. 043 mg^mol" 1.

30|$|The maximum {{bit rate}} of the {{proposed}} system is limited either by the RF modules or implemented hardware logic blocks. Indeed, the hardware FPGA implementations allow parallel/serial and serial/parallel converters with <b>minimum</b> <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>rates</b> of 25.36 and 36.27 Mbps obtained with Virtex II and Virtex V technologies, respectively (see Table  1). However, for the considered Zigbee protocol, the maximum bit {{rate of the}} proposed system {{is limited by the}} RF modules. The hardware FPGA implementation performance (for working clock frequency, see Table  1) of the proposed system (at the transmitter and receiver) is considered, and it is larger than the serial interface data rate and better than the bit rate, which is allowed by the considered Zigbee RF modules. Consequently, the limitation is imposed by the transmission rate of the parallel/serial and serial/parallel converters toward Zigbee Xbee RF modules while FPGA implementations allow to provide transmission rates to at least 25 Mbps. Thereby, for a null distance frame value (N[*]=[*] 0), the obtained data bit rate of the serial communication is 250 kbps (corresponding to a modulation rate of 625 symbols per second or baud, due to the maximum serial interface data rate of the Zigbee protocol based XBee Pro modules [33], and with an operating frequency modulation of 2.4 GHz. In the case of the Wi-Fi protocol, the maximum bit rate of the proposed system is limited by the work frequency of the implemented hardware modules. Although the FPGA implementation of the Lorenz generator allows to provide a throughput of 80 Mbps (maximal frequency of 25 MHz is allowed by the considered Virtex II platform with an encoded 32 -bit encrypted data), the maximum transmission bit rate of the proposed system is limited by the hyperchaotic key generators up to 25 Mbps (for N[*]=[*] 0) and by a corresponding modulation rate of 625, 000 baud. Therefore, the parallel/serial and serial/parallel converters to Wi-Fi Xbee RF modules limit the transmission rate up to the maximum work frequency, depending on the considered FPGA technology. Indeed, each symbol of the data transmission system carries 40 bits according to the data frame wordlength allowed by the serial interface Xbee modules. This digital modulation rate operates with a frequency modulation range between 2.4 and 2.5 GHz [26]. In summary, considering a synchronous system at the maximum work frequency allowed between the key stream generators and parallel/serial or serial/parallel converters, the limitations with respect to 54 -Mbps and 25 -kbps bit rates of the Wi-Fi and Zigbee RF modules are due to the work frequencies of hyperchaotic Lorenz generators and the serial interface data rate, respectively.|$|E
40|$|The {{system of}} direct {{payments}} in the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is being criticised {{with respect to}} the level, unequal distribution and allocation effects on production. Besides the decoupling of direct payments a modulation and a partial transmission to the second pillar of CAP are proposed. Modulation on a voluntary basis was already introduced in Agenda 2000. In its Mid-term Review of the Agenda the Commission proposes an obligatory dynamic modulation scheme including the capping of direct payments beyond a threshold of 300 000 â‚¬. Possible impacts of the Commission's proposal are assessed with simulations based on farm accounting data of EU-FADN. Distribution effects between farm sizes and member states are unveiled. Alternate options with regard to capping and progressive reductions of direct payments are analysed. Due to the different distribution of direct payments, farms of EU Member states will be affected differently by the proposal of the Commission: The franchise of 5 000 â‚¬ will exempt from modulation about tw -thirds of farms being represented by FADN respectively 15 % of the premium volume. About 80 % of the volume are subject to proportional reductions and 5 % fall off due to capping. More than four fifths of the capping affects Eastern Germany alone. The capping measurement leads to large distributional effects between farm sizes and between member states: In the first step of the dynamic modulation, premia beyond the franchise are reduced by 3 % while they are totally taken away beyond the capping threshold. Direct payments to large farms in Eastern Germany would be reduced by more than half. Due to drastic income shortfalls farm adaptations by splitting-up the farm enterprises or reducing the number of hired workers would be induced. An alternate scheme of modulation based on a progressive reduction of direct payments has been proposed. Elements of this system are a franchise, dynamic progressive reductions of direct payments within a progressive zone and proportional premia reductions beyond the upper limit of the progressive zone. There is no capping and with regard to administration purposes no other factors than the level of direct payments are included. With the determination of a few parameters â€” the franchise, the progression zone and the <b>minimum</b> <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>rates</b> of reduction â€” the system can be handled flexibly in view of social and budgetary objectives. Compared to the Commission's proposal farms entitled to less than 100 000 â‚¬ of direct payments would forfeit less money under the progressive reductions system. Farms entitled to 100 000 to 300 000 â‚¬ of direct payments would lose moderately more. Among the large farms however, premia reductions would be distributed more evenly and never exceed the maximum rate of e. g. 35 % while by the capping as proposed by the Commission affected farms could lose much more with the average loss increasing from 35 to 42 % of original entitlements. midterm-review, modulation, farm accounting data network, direct payments, Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} master's thesis was {{to assess}} the ten- year trends and {{regional}} differences in management and outcome of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) within Switzerland. The thesis is composed of two articles. First, in the article "Trends in hospital management of acute myocardial infarction in Switzerland, 1998 to 2008 " over 102, 700 cases of AMI with corresponding management and revascularization procedures were assessed. The results showed a considerable increase in the numbers of hospital discharges for AMI, namely due to the increase of between- hospital transfers. Rates of intensive care unit admissions remained stable. All types of revascularization procedures showed an increase. In particular, overall stenting rates increased with drug-eluting stents partly replacing bare stents. Second, in the article "The region makes the difference: disparities in management of acute myocardial infarction within Switzerland" around 25, 600 cases of AMI with corresponding management were assessed for the period of 2007 - 2008 and according to seven Swiss regions. As reported by our results, considerable regional differences in AMI management were stated within Switzerland. Although each region showed different trends regarding revascularization interventions, Leman and Ticino contrast significantly by presenting the <b>minimum</b> <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>rates</b> in almost all assessed parameters. As a consequence these two regions differ the most from the Swiss average. The impact of the changes in trends and the regional differences in AMI management on Swiss patient's outcome and economics remains to be assessed. Purpose: To assess ten-year trends in management and outcome of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in Switzerland. Methods: Swiss hospital discharge database for the 1998 to 2008 period. AMI was defined as a primary discharge diagnosis code I 21 according to the CIM- 10 classification of the World Health Organization. Management and revascularization procedures were assessed. Results: Overall, 102, 729 hospital discharges with a diagnosis of AMI were analyzed. The number of hospital discharges increased almost three-fold from 5530 in 1998 to 13, 834 in 2008, namely due to a considerable increase in between-hospital transfers (1352 in 1998, 6494 in 2008). Relative to all hospital discharges, Intensive Care Unit admission rate was 38. 0 % in 1998 and remained stable (36. 2 %) in 2008 (p for trend= 0. 25). Percutaneous revascularization rates increased from 6. 0 % to 39. 9 % (p for trend< 0. 001). Non-drug-eluting stent use increased from 1. 3 % to 16. 6 % (p for trend< 0. 05). Drug eluting stents appeared in 2004 and increased to 23. 5 % of hospital discharges in 2008 (p for trend= 0. 07). Coronary artery bypass graft increased from 1. 0 % to 3. 0 % (p for trend< 0. 001). Circulatory assistance increased from 0. 2 % to 1. 7 % (p for trend< 0. 001). Thrombolysis showed no significant changes, from 0. 5 % to 1. 9 % (p for trend= 0. 64). Most of these trends were confirmed after multivariate adjustment. Conclusion: Between 1998 and 2008 the number of hospital discharges for AMI increased considerably in Switzerland, namely due to between-hospital transfers. Overall stenting rates increased, drug-eluting stents partly replacing bare stents. The impact of these changes on outcome and economics remains to be assessed...|$|E

To investigate whether vertical accretion of Refuge marshland is limited by sediment accumulation, a study was conducted to measure rates of mineral sediment and organic matter accumulation (mass/area/time) and accretion (length/time) using 137 Cs and 210 Pb chronologies developed for 19 marsh sites throughout the Refuge. To establish patterns and rates of recent historical marsh loss, an analysis of historical aerial photographs was undertaken. ☐ Results indicate that Bombay Hook NWR has lost a total of ~ 8. 6 million m 2 of marsh area since 1961. This loss was mostly caused by the formation of inland pools (~ 50 % of area lost) and shoreface erosion along the Delaware Bay boundary (~ 35 %), with a smaller contribution by waterway channel widening (~ 15 %). Shoreface erosion was most prevalent in the southern half of the Refuge with some locations experiencing up to ~ 12 m/yr of retreat since 1961, while the northern section experienced far less retreat at 0. 6 m/yr. The formation and expansion of inland pools were mostly concentrated in the northern half of the Refuge, adjacent to three freshwater impoundments constructed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in the late 1930 s. ☐ Salt marsh accretion and mass accumulation rates measured for this study fall within the middle to upper range of similarly determined rates for undisturbed marshes of the Delaware Estuary, and rates based on 137 Cs and 210 Pb methods were largely in agreement. Accretion rates (137 Cs) for low marsh sites averaged 0. 65 cm/yr and were significantly higher than rates at high marsh sites, which averaged 0. 42 cm/yr. Combined mineral and organic mass accumulation rates (137 Cs) exhibited a similar difference between low and high marsh sites, averaging 0. 31 g/cm 2 /yr and 0. 13 g/cm 2 /yr, respectively. Mineral and organic mass accumulation rates correlated strongly with rates of accretion (R 2 =. 85 and. 79 respectively), revealing that both mineral sediment and organic matter drive marsh accretion at the Refuge, and that belowground biomass accumulation and aboveground mineral sediment deposition set the <b>minimum</b> <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>rates</b> of accretion, respectively. ☐ Marsh accretion rates measured in this study met or exceeded the rate of recent relative sea-level rise for the middle Delaware Estuary, based on the NOAA tide gauge record for Reedy Point (0. 35 ± 0. 05 mm/yr, 1956 - 2015). This result, in combination with the high rates of mineral accumulation measured throughout the Refuge, makes clear that there is not a marsh accretionary deficit related to insufficient mineral sediment. Moreover, the marsh soil record provides no evidence that the formation and expansion of marsh pools since the 1960 s is related to low rates of marsh accretion or sediment supply. Additional research on historical changes in tidal inundation, marsh accretion, and elevation change is needed to better understand the nature of pool expansion and marsh loss at the Refuge.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the main {{results of the}} monitoring {{on the effectiveness of}} the cross compliance standard 4. 6 ‘Minimum livestock stocking rates and/or appropriate regimes’ carried out in two case studies within the project MO. NA. CO: sheep grazing in medium-rich pastures in southern Apennines and in the plain of Sardinia, Italy. The monitoring involved aspects related to soil, flora, livestock and economics (competitiveness differential). The study showed, although in the short term, that the minimum stocking rate 0. 2 LU/ha/year was not effective and, conversely, the effectiveness of the maximum level of stocking rate (4 LU/ha) for the maintenance of the habitat. The generalization in applying <b>minimum</b> <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>rate,</b> not taking into account the climatic conditions, forage resources or farming system (including the species of grazing animal) may lead to a serious nullification of the conditions of the Standard. The authors recommend to identify homogeneous areas and eligible specific stocking rates from all Italian regions, also considering the animal species...|$|R

After all cases of campylobacteriosis notified from 1993 to 1997 had been geocoded, the <b>minimum</b> <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> disease notification <b>rates</b> were calculated for rural and urban areas of New Zealand. The estimated <b>maximum</b> rural <b>rates</b> were four times higher than estimated minimum rural <b>rates,</b> whereas estimated <b>minimum</b> <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> urban <b>rates</b> varied minimally. The impact of address geocoding on the estimation of disease notification rates across Public Health Service Regions showed considerable variation. The relative proportions of ungeocoded notifications to rural notifications ranged from 1. 3 : 1 to 10. 2 : 1, reflecting the range of uncertainty in estimated rural rates of campylobacteriosis. Unless the reliability of captured rural address data is improved significantly, disease surveillance systems will underestimate rural rates of disease and limit small area analyses...|$|R
40|$|Minimum {{detection}} {{rates at}} screening are sometimes laid down as standards {{for breast cancer}} screening programmes, based on underlying incidence of the disease in the age group screened. Detection rates should also depend on desired sensitivity, mean sojourn time, interscreening interval and the screening round – that is, prevalent (first) or incident (second or subsequent). In this paper, we use these quantities to derive expected, <b>minimum</b> <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> detection <b>rates</b> proportional to the underlying incidence as well as estimated underlying incidence rates from extrapolation of prescreening trends in England and Wales to derive alternative standard <b>minimum,</b> expected <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> detection <b>rates</b> per 1000 women screened for the UK Breast Screening Programme, as follows: minimum detection rates should be 4. 1 and 4. 3 at prevalence screen and incidence screens, respectively; expected rates should be 6. 9 and 4. 8 <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>rates</b> of 9. 6 and 5. 5.

These linguistic variables are defined through Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems (FRBS). The analysis is made for FRBS types 1 and 2 where in the first case, the inference method used is Mamdani's and the defuzzification is the center of gravity. For type- 2 FRBS is used as input variables interval type- 2 fuzzy sets, and as output intervals. The output is defuzzificated by the Type Reducer method that use the algorithm of Karnik-Mendel (KM). The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the solutions of the Verhulst's model where the parameter, rate of reproductivity, is determined through the type- 1 and type- 2 FRBS. The comparison is made computing the region built from the solutions corresponding to the <b>minimum</b> <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>rate.</b> It has been noticed that the region corresponding to type- 2 FRBS is contained in the region built similarly from type- 1 FRBS, showing a higher accuracy in the response [1], [2], [4]...|$|R
