40|$|The keen {{competition}} in industry puts {{a great deal}} of pressure upon all parts involved, and in addition to demands on the physical product, there are demands on the service aspects, such as an increased demand on the configuration of the delivered materials and their packaging, on throughput time, timeliness, and increased cost efficiency. The performance of the materials flow systems, in which <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> constitutes an important part, therefore plays a crucial part in the strive for competitive advantage. The <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> <b>function</b> contributes to the adding of value when, for example, mixing articles, packaging them as demanded by the customer, or orienting and positioning them for a later process step, as well as influences cost efficiency and throughput time. This thesis deals with the relation between the resources required for the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> <b>function</b> and the design of materials flow systems and is directed towards the development of a method for evaluation and improvement of materials flow systems regarding the performance of the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> <b>function.</b> The development of a conceptual framework for the perspective of <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> as contributing to the value added in materials flow systems is included as an important basis. An improved understanding of the purpose of the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> <b>function,</b> as well as principles and procedures for how to utilise this knowledge to evaluate and improve the performance in terms of efficiency, is provided. The research was directed towards theory building, and a primarily inductive approach has been adopted, where the empirical data was gathered in ten case studies mainly within the manufacturing industry and warehousing. A method was developed which makes it possible to estimate, in an early design stage, the efficiency of the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> <b>function,</b> and to identify where along materials flows that changes in the materials flow system design would give prerequisites for improvements. Further, the efficiency measurement has been utilised in a study aiming at relating the efficiency of the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> <b>function</b> to the process localisation {{in the context of the}} automotive industry and outsourcing.

40|$|Materials {{handling}} systems are an integrating {{component of a}} manufacturing system and as such must be considered within an integrated approach to manufacturing systems design. This work proposes to integrate the operation allocation and the materials handling system selection problems in a flexible manufacturing system by extending the operation allocation model to include some aspects of materials handling system design. The objective of the operation allocation model is to select a group of machines where {{the operations of the}} part types will be performed and then to assign those operations to the selected machines. The operation allocation model interfaces with the materials handling system selection model by providing input data {{in the form of the}} manufacturing operations to be performed at each machining center. The selection of the materials handling system is centered on the matching of the parts visiting a machining center to perform a manufacturing operation and the abilities of the handling equipment to perform the required <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> <b>functions</b> of those part types. The objective is to select an optimal group of materials handling equipment to be assigned to a cell. A computer program was developed to greatly automate the process of solving the models.

The need for <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> is related to the design of materials flow systems in relation to process localisation. Five cases, having different numbers of process localisations and types of activities, are compared based on actual efficiency and potential of the system design.

40|$|Operation Allocation and <b>Material</b> <b>Handling</b> Systems Selection are {{important}} functions of a manufacturing system {{and as such}} must be considered within an integrated approach to manufacturing systems design. This work, an extension to the work done by Paulo (1999) proposes to integrate two important functions of manufacturing, i. e. operation allocation and <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> systems selection, and solve them iteratively. The objective of the operation allocation model is to select a group of machines where {{the operations of the}} part types will be performed and then to assign those operations to the selected machines. The <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> equipment is allocated by the <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system selection model to transport a part type from one machine to the other for the next operation. The operation allocation model obtains one of its inputs from the <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system selection model in the form of <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> equipment to be used for transporting a part type from one machine to another machine. The operation allocation model interfaces with the <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system selection model by providing input data {{in the form of the}} manufacturing operations to be performed at each machining center. The <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system is selected on the basis of the parts visiting a machining center to perform a manufacturing operation and the abilities of the handling devices to perform the required <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> <b>functions</b> of those part types.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from June 22, 2016 - June 22, 2018 Small and medium-sized enterprises that are characterized by high-mix, low-volume, and highly variable production operations often have unstructured material movement processes that are prone to <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes. These sub-optimal <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> systems are oftentimes a result of small and medium-sized enterprise's limited resources. Current tools to assist organizations in reducing <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes are resource intensive, complex, or too vague. <b>Material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes are defined in this research as: a) inappropriate <b>material</b> <b>handling,</b> b) operator search time, and c) inefficient forklift routing. To help {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} reduce <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes it is hypothesized that tailored visual management systems 1) can be designed from the analysis of three <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes, and 2) can yield a low resource intensive solution to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in reducing <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes. In order to test these hypotheses, a methodology to design an ad-hoc <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system is developed, tested via a case study, and validated via two alternate scenarios. Results show that ad-hoc visual management systems can be designed from low resource intensive analysis and are capable of increasing the efficiency of in-house material movements in small and medium-sized enterprises.

40|$|As {{a part of}} {{production}} logistics, <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> {{is concerned with the}} internal material flow, which consist of inventory management and transportation. The overall goal with <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> is to ensure the production system access to <b>material,</b> where the <b>handling</b> is to be performed without any damage to neither material nor personnel. In a manufacturing company, a sufficient part of the total production cost can be directly derived from internal <b>materials</b> <b>handling.</b> According to Lean Production both transportation and inventory should be considered as waste. Therefore, it is important to improve the efficiency of the internal <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> system, though it must not be on the expense of the delivery precision or compromising the safety. The study assumes that the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> system is supposed to provide the productions system with the right materials, in the right quantity, at the right time, and doing so in cost effective manner. The purpose with this study is to identify and analyze <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> in order to develop and present recommendations for a safer and more cost efficient <b>materials</b> <b>handling,</b> with preserved delivery precision. The study is a case study, which has been conducted on site at Sandvik Mining in Sandviken. Sandvik Mining produces drill bits, drill rods and adapters, which are used for rock drilling. The data collection has been done through interviews and observations, where the authors have been interviewing employees from Sandvik Mining as well as conducting direct observations of the processes within the field of study. The study was complemented by a literature review, where the most influential fields of study where <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> and Lean Production. The report presents a map of current material transportation flows within Sandvik Mining as well as how the management of these flows is conducted. From the map, problem areas have been identified and the underlying cause of these can be derived from the variations within the working methods. The variations occur due to the fact the <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system does not meet the six aspects of the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> equation, namely: why, what, where, when and how materials should be transported as well as by who the transportation should performed. In order to create an effective <b>materials</b> <b>handling,</b> the study presents recommendations that aims to define and standardize <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> activities, which could be done by material-dedicated buffer zones. The study claims that these material-dedicated buffer zones would serve as reference points for the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> system, and based on which, it is possible to define the different <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> activities. The buffer zones can also provide necessary control to the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> system {{as well as to the}} production system.

Model checking is a formal method that automatically verifies whether a system meets its specification by exhaustively analyzing {{a model of the}} corresponding system. To achieve a model of the <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system, a modeling methodology has been developed and is introduced in this thesis.
