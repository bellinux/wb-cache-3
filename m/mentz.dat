5|$|Now in {{the town}} of Throop, NY38 follows the Owasco Outlet through open, mostly flat areas dotted with houses amongst fields and trees. Within Throop, it serves the small hamlet of Sawyers Corners, where NY38 meets Turnpike Road (County Route10B or CR10B). North of this junction, the houses give way to dense forests as the route {{continues}} along the waterway into the town of <b>Mentz</b> and the village of Port Byron a short distance north of the town line. It follows Main Street through a mostly commercial and industrial portion of the village to the village center, where it intersects NY31 at Rochester and Utica Streets. NY38 turns west, overlapping NY31 along Rochester Street.|$|E
5|$|South Africa {{have played}} twelve Test matches, seven {{of which were}} played pre-exclusion, and five of them post-exclusion. Two players, Jennifer Gove and Lorna Ward, have played all seven matches pre-exclusion. Yvonne van <b>Mentz,</b> Brenda Williams and Mignon du Preez are the only South African women to have scored Test centuries, while Jean McNaughton, Lorna Ward and Sunette Loubser have all taken five-wicket hauls, with Ward doing it on three occasions. This list {{contains}} every woman who has played Test cricket for South Africa. The list is initially arranged in {{the order in which}} each player won her Test cap.

5|$|The first {{official}} trial {{for war crimes}} committed at Treblinka was held in Düsseldorf between 12 October 1964 and 24 August 1965, preceded by the 1951 trial of SS-Scharführer Josef Hirtreiter, which was triggered by charges of war crimes unrelated to his service at the camp. The trial was delayed because the United States and the Soviet Union had lost interest in prosecuting German war crimes {{with the onset of}} the Cold War. Many of the more than 90,000 Nazi war criminals recorded in German files were serving in positions of prominence under West German chancellor Konrad Adenauer. In 1964 and 1965 eleven former SS camp personnel were brought to trial by West Germany, including commandant Kurt Franz. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, along with Artur Matthes (Totenlager) and Willi <b>Mentz</b> and August Miete (both from Lazaret). Gustav Münzberger (gas chambers) received 12 years, Franz Suchomel (gold and money) 7 years, Otto Stadie (operation) 6 years, Erwin Lambert (gas chambers) 4 years, and Albert Rum (Totenlager) 3 years. Otto Horn (corpse detail) was acquitted.|$|E
25|$|Yvonne van <b>Mentz</b> is {{a former}} South African cricketer. She scored South Africa's first century in Women's Test cricket, with an unbeaten 105 against England in the fourth Test played during the 1960–61 season.

That weekend this area was bulldozed. On September 21, 2016, 1,281anthropologists, archaeologists, museum officials, and others signed and released a letter {{in support of the}} tribal community, calling for further study of the area to be affected by the pipeline in South Dakota.

However, many are still concerned about the cumulative effect the project may have on sites that lie outside the 150 ft corridor. Jon Eagle, a Historic Preservation Officer for the tribe, was {{invited to participate in}} the evaluation on Sept. 23, but was not allowed access to the areas of the corridor on private property.

The scholar Steven <b>Mentz</b> argues that [...] "the oceans [...]. figure the boundaries of human transgression; they function symbolically as {{places in the world}} into which mortal bodies cannot safely go". In Mentz's view, the European exploration of the oceans in the fifteenth century caused a shift in the meanings of the sea. Whereas a garden symbolised happy coexistence with nature, life was threatened at sea: the ocean counterbalanced the purely pastoral.|$|E
500|$|The {{next section}} of Treblinka II (Camp 2, {{also called the}} lower camp or Auffanglager), was the {{receiving}} area where the railway unloading ramp extended from the Treblinka line into the camp. There was a long and narrow platform surrounded by barbed-wire fencing. A new building, erected on the platform, was disguised as a railway station complete with a wooden clock and fake rail terminal signs. SS-Scharführer Josef Hirtreiter {{who worked on the}} unloading ramp was known for being especially cruel; he grabbed crying toddlers by their feet and smashed their heads against wagons. Behind a second fence, about [...] from the track, there were two large barracks used for undressing, with a cashier's booth which collected money and jewellery, ostensibly for safekeeping. Jews who resisted were taken away or beaten to death by the guards. The area where the women and children were shorn of their hair {{was on the other side}} of the path from the men. All buildings in the lower camp, including the barber barracks, contained the piled up clothing and belongings of the prisoners. Next to the station building, further to the right, there was a Sorting Square where all baggage was first collected by the Lumpenkommando. It was flanked by fake infirmary called [...] "Lazaret", with the Red Cross sign on it. It was a small barracks surrounded by barbed wire where the sick, old, wounded and [...] "difficult" [...] prisoners were taken. Directly behind the [...] "Lazaret" [...] shack there was an open excavation pit seven metres (23ft) deep. These prisoners were led to the edge of the pit and shot one at a time by Blockführer Willi <b>Mentz,</b> nicknamed [...] "Frankenstein" [...] by the inmates. <b>Mentz</b> single-handedly executed thousands of Jews, aided by his supervisor, August Miete, who was called the [...] "Angel of Death" [...] by the prisoners. The pit was also used to burn old worn-out clothes and identity papers deposited by new arrivals at the undressing area.|$|E
500|$|She {{was sold}} for £8,000 in November 1920 to the Jersey-born South African {{entrepreneur}} T. B. Davis as a memory {{to his son}} who died during World War I. Later that month, the ship steamed to West India Dock, Tilbury, for a brief refit and Thames was renamed Training Ship (TS) General Botha, after Louis Botha, the first Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa. Before departing for Plymouth for extra crewmen on 6 January 1921, the ship was visited by Sir Reginald Blanckenberg, High Commissioner for South Africa, and his wife. She set sail from Plymouth on 18 January and ran into a heavy storm in the English Channel that smashed in the inadequately boarded-up sponsons and forced the ship to turn about for Plymouth for repairs where General Botha arrived two days later. The ship departed on 8 February and arrived in Cape Town on 26 March where she was greeted by the Minister of Defence, Colonel Hendrik <b>Mentz</b> and other notables.|$|E

He not only collected British works but imported Greek and Latin classics, and in 1790, he acquired the collection of Count Charles de Revicksky, paying an initial £1000, and then £500 annually until the count's death, only three years later. George often paid great fees for rare books, including a woodcut of St Christopher dated to 1423, believed {{at that time to}} be the oldest work in ink with a date on it, the Papal Indulgence Letters of 1452, the Mazarin Bible of 1455, the <b>Mentz</b> Psalter of 1457, and some of the earliest works form the printing presses of Augsburg and Nuremberg such as Bonaventurae and Comestiorum Vitiorum. In 1812, George John was involved in an intense bidding war with his cousin, The Duke of Marlborough, for a copy of Boccacio's The Decameron of 1471, one of only three known copies. Marlborough won the auction with a bid of £2,260 – an amount described by Charles Spencer as [...] "ludicrous" [...] for that time – but he later sold it to George for £750.|$|E

2500|$|In 1969 Warren B. Austin {{undertook}} a pioneering computer-aided {{analysis of the}} work of Chettle and Greene. He concluded that Groatsworth was written by Chettle on the basis of word choice frequencies. Austin's analysis convinced many scholars, but in 2006 Richard Westley came to the opposite conclusion, accusing Austin of pre-selecting evidence to support his view. Westley concluded that the pamphlet was the work of Greene and that the evidence of Chettle's quirks was the result of his role as a transcriber. Steve <b>Mentz,</b> writing in 2008, argued that Groatsworth included a substantial amount of material written by Greene, but that its idiosyncratic structure suggested that there was significant editorial intervention in the source material creating [...] "an unusual sort of collaboration" [...] between Chettle and Greene.|$|E
2500|$|All of van Mentz's {{appearances}} for South Africa {{occurred during}} the England women's cricket team tour of South Africa in 1960–61. She first faced England during a warm-up match for the touring side, appearing for Southern Transvaal. Batting {{as part of the}} top order, she top-scored for her side, scoring nine fours as part of her 68 runs. She also opened the bowling for Southern Transvaal, but bowled for 15 overs without taking a wicket. In the first Test against England, she batted at number seven, and made scores of 11 and 15 in the two innings. She also claimed three wickets in the match. After playing for a South African XI against England without making a significant impact, van <b>Mentz</b> was South Africa's leading wicket-taker in the second Test, taking four wickets as England declared their innings closed on 351 for 6. She then scored 17 and 11 in each innings as South Africa were forced to follow on, eventually forcing a draw. She had little impact in the third Test, making scores of three in both innings, and taking no wickets. In the fourth Test, van <b>Mentz</b> scored South Africa's first century in women's Test cricket, remaining 105 not out when South Africa declared on 266 for 8. The match eventually concluded as a draw. Her score is the highest of just two centuries by South African women in Test cricket, the other being a total of exactly 100 by Brenda Williams.She still holds the record for the highest test score by any woman cricketer when batting at number 6 position(105*) and she was the first female cricketer to score a test ton when batting at number 6 position or lower in Women's test history ...|$|E

As the collier's captain was a merchantman, Commander George W. <b>Mentz</b> was ordered aboard to command her overall relief efforts. On 16 May, Sterling arrived in Fort-de-France with the United States' first installment of relief supplies and was still anchored nearby when she witnessed Mt. Pelée's subsequent eruption on May 20.
