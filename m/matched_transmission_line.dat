Fast non-fiber optic cells are thus embedded into a <b>matched</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line.</b> Putting {{it at the end}} of a transmission line leads to reflections and doubled switching time.

40|$|Middle-ear sound {{transmission}} was evaluated as the middle-ear transfer admittance HMY (the ratio of stapes velocity to ear-canal sound pressure near the umbo) in gerbils during closed-field sound stimulation at frequencies from 0. 1 to 60 kHz, a range that spans the gerbil’s audiometric range. Similar measurements were performed in two laboratories. The HMY magnitude (a) increased with frequency below 1 kHz, (b) remained approximately constant with frequency from 5 to 35 kHz, and (c) decreased substantially from 35 to 50 kHz. The HMY phase increased linearly with frequency from 5 to 35 kHz, {{consistent with a}} 20 – 29 μs delay, and flattened at higher frequencies. Measurements from different directions showed that stapes motion is predominantly pistonlike except in a narrow frequency band around 10 kHz. Cochlear input impedance was estimated from HMY and previously-measured cochlear sound pressure. Results {{do not support the}} idea that the middle ear is a lossless <b>matched</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line.</b> Results support the ideas that (1) middle-ear transmission is consistent with a mechanical transmission line or multiresonant network between 5 and 35 kHz and decreases at higher frequencies, (2) stapes motion is pistonlike over most of the gerbil auditory range, and (3) middle-ear transmission properties are a determinant of the audiogram...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Impedance <b>matching</b> between <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> and antennas is an {{important}} and fundamental concept in electromagnetic theory.

50|$|While {{there are}} certain {{wideband}} antenna designs, many antennas are classified as resonant and perform according to design around a particular frequency. This applies especially to broadcasting stations and communication systems which are confined to one frequency or narrow frequency band. This includes the dipole and monopole antennas {{and all of the}} designs based on them (Yagi, dipole or monopole arrays, folded dipole, etc.). In addition to the directive gain in beam antennas suffering away from the design frequency, the antenna feedpoint impedance is very sensitive to frequency offsets. Especially for transmitting, the antenna is often intended to operate at the resonant frequency. At the resonant frequency, by definition, that impedance is a pure resistance which matches the characteristic impedance of the <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> and the output (or input) impedance of the transmitter (or receiver). At frequencies away from the resonant frequency, the impedance includes some reactance (capacitance or inductance). It is possible for an antenna tuner to be used to cancel that reactance (and to change the resistance to <b>match</b> the <b>transmission</b> <b>line),</b> however that is often avoided as an extra complication (and needs to be controlled at the antenna side of the <b>transmission</b> <b>line).</b>|$|R

The HEMT device employs two fingers each 15 micrometers wide.

The three-stage design uses coplanar waveguide topology with a very narrow ground-to-ground spacing of 14 micrometers. Quarter-wave <b>matching</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>lines,</b> on-chip metal-insulator-metal shunt capacitors, series thin-film resistors, and matching stubs {{were used in the}} design. Series resistors in the shunt branch arm provide the basic circuit stabilization.

This chip was developed as part of the DARPA Submillimeter Wave Imaging Focal Plane Technology (SWIFT) program (see figure). Submillimeter-wave amplifiers could enable more sensitive receivers for earth science, planetary remote sensing, and astrophysics telescopes, particularly in radio astronomy, both from the ground and in space. A small atmospheric window at 340 GHz exists and could enable ground-based observations. However, the submillimeter-wave regime (above 300 GHz) is best used for space telescopes as Earth s atmosphere attenuates most of the signal through water and oxygen absorption.
