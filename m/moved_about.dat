5|$|After leaving Cambridge, Horrocks {{returned}} {{to his home in}} Lancashire and began collecting books and instruments in order to pursue his main interest, the study of astronomy. In the summer of 1639, he left home and <b>moved</b> <b>about</b> 18 miles along the coast to the village of Much Hoole, where it is thought he took up a post as a tutor for the children of the Stones family, who were prosperous haberdashers living at Carr House, within the Bank Hall Estate, Bretherton.|$|E
5|$|Eclipses {{can occur}} {{only when the}} Sun is within about 15 to 18 degrees of a node, (10 to 12 degrees for central eclipses). This is {{referred}} to as an eclipse limit. In the time it takes for the Moon to return to a node (draconic month), the apparent position of the Sun has <b>moved</b> <b>about</b> 29 degrees, relative to the nodes. Since the eclipse limit creates a window of opportunity of up to 36 degrees (24 degrees for central eclipses), it is possible for partial eclipses (or rarely a partial and a central eclipse) to occur in consecutive months.|$|E
5|$|Miles advised Freyberg, still {{unaware of}} the fate of 6th Brigade due to poor communications, of Godwin-Austen's {{instructions}} on {{his return to the}} 2nd New Zealand Division's headquarters early on 1 December. Later that day, the 6th Field Regiment was overrun by German forces advancing to Belhamed. Miles, concerned about his artillery given the uncertainty surrounding the status of the 6th Brigade, was present on an inspection of the battle zone and he <b>moved</b> <b>about,</b> rifle in hand, encouraging his men, and directing them to fire their guns over open sights. Eventually, he was wounded and taken prisoner. This action was the most costly day of the war for the divisional artillery, with 275 casualties, including 96 prisoners of war, Miles among them.|$|E
40|$|<b>Move</b> <b>About</b> AS is a Norwegian {{car sharing}} {{provider}} that is {{established in the}} German market. The goal of this thesis is to identify ways for <b>Move</b> <b>About</b> to strengthen {{their position in the}} German market. In order to acquire the relevant information, the authors have conducted an external analysis, an internal analysis and a survey. The findings are represented in a SWOT analysis. To conduct these researches the authors have used theories relevant to <b>Move</b> <b>About’s</b> situation. Through the research, the authors found that <b>Move</b> <b>About</b> has potential to become the leading provider of electrical car sharing services in the German market. <b>Move</b> <b>About</b> is recommended to position themselves as a focused differentiator exclusively focused on environmental friendly and cost-effective transport in strategic areas in Germany. In addition, <b>Move</b> <b>About</b> should negotiate strategic partnerships with existing car sharing providers...|$|R

5|$|On Grand Bahama Island, Wilma {{produced}} sustained {{winds of}} 155km/h (95mph) and {{a gust of}} 178km/h (111mph). The hurricane also produced a storm surge of over 3.7m (12ft), reportedly as high as 6.1m (20ft) along the southwestern portion of the island. The surge, which <b>moved</b> <b>about</b> 305m (1,000ft) inland, caused large-scale flooding that washed away or destroyed about 800homes. Damage was estimated at $100million (2005USD) on the western portion of the island. Excluding the southwestern region of Grand Bahama, {{the majority of the}} island reported minor wind damage, and the eastern end of the island reported little, or no, damage. Over 7,000people on the island were directly affected by the hurricane, many of whom had not fully recovered from hurricanes Frances and Jeanne during the previous year.|$|E
5|$|The Greeks {{used the}} word planēton {{to refer to the}} seven {{celestial}} bodies that moved with respect to the background stars and they held a geocentric view that these bodies <b>moved</b> <b>about</b> the Earth. In his work, The Republic (X.616E–617B), the Greek philosopher Plato provided the oldest known statement defining the order of the planets in Greek astronomical tradition. His list, in order of the nearest to the most distant from the Earth, was as follows: the Moon, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the fixed stars. In his dialogue Timaeus, Plato proposed that the progression of these objects across the skies depended on their distance, so that the most distant object moved the slowest.|$|E
5|$|Late in life, Henry became obese, with a waist {{measurement}} of , {{and had to}} be <b>moved</b> <b>about</b> with the help of mechanical inventions. He was covered with painful, pus-filled boils and possibly suffered from gout. His obesity and other medical problems can be traced from the jousting accident in 1536, in which he suffered a leg wound. The accident re-opened and aggravated a previous injury he had sustained years earlier, to the extent that his doctors found it difficult to treat. The wound festered for the remainder of his life and became ulcerated, thus preventing him from maintaining the level of physical activity he had previously enjoyed. The jousting accident is also believed to have caused Henry's mood swings, which may have had a dramatic effect on his personality and temperament.|$|E

5|$|Natives of {{the region}} {{encountered}} foreigners at several times and places during the 18thand 19thcenturies. European and American vessels explored the coastal area around {{the mouth of the}} river in the late 18thcentury, trading with local natives. The contact would prove devastating to the Indian tribes; a large portion of their population was wiped out by a smallpox epidemic. Canadian explorer Alexander Mackenzie crossed what is now interior British Columbia in 1793. From 1805 to 1807, the Lewis and Clark Expedition entered the Oregon Country along the Clearwater and Snake rivers, and encountered numerous small settlements of natives. Their records recount tales of hospitable traders who were not above stealing small items from the visitors. They also noted brass teakettles, a British musket, and other artifacts that had been obtained in trade with coastal tribes. From the earliest contact with westerners, the natives of the mid- and lower Columbia were not tribal, but instead congregated in social units no larger than a village, and more often at a family level; these units would shift with the season as people <b>moved</b> <b>about,</b> following the salmon catch up and down the river's tributaries.|$|E
5|$|While Agesilaus <b>moved</b> <b>about</b> Corinthian {{territory}} {{with the}} bulk of his army, he left a sizable force at Lechaeum to guard the port. Part of this force at Lechaeum was composed of men from the city of Amyclae, who traditionally returned home for a certain religious festival when on campaign. With this festival approaching, the Spartan commander at Lechaeum marched out with a force of hoplites and cavalry to escort the Amyclaeans past Corinth on their way home. After successfully leading his force well past the city, the commander ordered his hoplites to turn and return to Lechaeum, while the cavalry continued on with the Amyclaeans. Although he would be marching near the walls of the city of Corinth with his force, he expected no trouble, believing that the men in the city were thoroughly cowed and unwilling to march out.|$|E
5|$|Tulips {{grow from}} bulbs, {{and can be}} {{propagated}} through both seeds and buds. Seeds from a tulip will form a flowering bulb after 7–12 years. When a bulb grows into the flower, the original bulb will disappear, but a clone bulb forms in its place, as do several buds. Properly cultivated, these buds will become bulbs of their own. The mosaic virus spreads only through buds, not seeds, and so cultivating the most appealing varieties takes years. Propagation is greatly slowed down by the virus. In the Northern Hemisphere, tulips bloom in April and May for about one week. During the plant's dormant phase from (Northern Hemisphere) June to September, bulbs can be uprooted and <b>moved</b> <b>about,</b> so actual purchases (in the spot market) occurred during these months. During {{the rest of the}} year, florists, or tulip traders, signed contracts before a notary to buy tulips {{at the end of the}} season (effectively futures contracts). Thus the Dutch, who developed many of the techniques of modern finance, created a market for tulip bulbs, which were durable goods. Short selling was banned by an edict of 1610, which was reiterated or strengthened in 1621 and 1630, and again in 1636. Short sellers were not prosecuted under these edicts, but their contracts were deemed unenforceable.|$|E
