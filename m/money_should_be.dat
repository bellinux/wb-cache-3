5|$|The Treaty of Bruges (1375) ensured {{peace for}} two years, but after it expired, {{fighting}} resumed between England and France. In 1377 Edward III was succeeded by Richard II. During the war, England and France struggled {{for control of}} the English Channel, with raids on both coasts. With the renewed hostilities, Parliament voted that <b>money</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> spent on defending and fortifying England's south coast, and defences were erected in Kent in anticipation of a French invasion. There was internal unrest as well as external threats, and Dalyngrigge was involved in suppressing the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. The manor of Bodiam was granted a charter in 1383 permitting a weekly market and an annual fair to be held. In 1385, a fleet of 1,200 ships– variously cogs, barges, and galleys– gathered across the English Channel at Sluys, Flanders; the population of southern England {{was in a state of}} panic. Later in the year, Edward Dalyngrigge was granted a licence to fortify his manor house.|$|E
5|$|Lacking that guidance, discussions {{began on}} how the bequest <b>money</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> spent. The City Lands Committee {{suggested}} in a report that the bequest should be spent on educating {{a larger number of}} boys and this approach was adopted in 1826. A number of people including Richard Taylor, a printer and an assistant to the founding of University College London, urged the Corporation of London to spend the bequest on creating a day school for the largest possible number of boys. In 1830, they proposed that the City of London Corporation School be founded with Taylor as a governor, and that the school to be established {{on the site of the}} disused London Workhouse. In the mean time, a small number of boys, who became known as Carpenter's scholars, were sent to Tonbridge School. In 1829, an Act of Parliament was passed to transform the workhouse into a school and governors were appointed. Conditions at the workhouse site had deteriorated and much money was needed for its maintenance. The only funds available, though, were the same £300 (about £22,000 in 2008) a year budget the workhouse had received.|$|E

25|$|The {{ship was}} almost built in Norway by Framnæs, the yard which would later build the Endurance {{but it was}} thought that the British government's <b>money</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> spent at a British yard and the Discovery was built by the Dundee Shipbuilders Company, which {{primarily}} made smaller vessels such as trawlers, tugboats and steam yachts. The yard was previously owned by Alexander Stephen and Sons and had built the Terra Nova (purchased in 1910 by Scott for his last expedition) in 1884.|$|E

25|$|This {{proposal}} was cause for debate {{because it was}} legally stipulated that the Mint was unlike any other government operation and that <b>money</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> produced in Canada’s capital region. Another point of tension was that the Cabinet Minister was from Winnipeg. Plants that are over 1,000 miles apart would endure communication and distribution difficulties. A study had shown that the division had merit because raw materials could be purchased from a supplier in Alberta, rather than a competitor outside of Canada. Eventually, it was agreed upon in December 1971 that the Mint would build a facility in Winnipeg. The land was purchased in 1972 and construction began {{at the end of}} the year.|$|E
25|$|On 25 May 2016, a Joint Committee on Findings of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission was appointed, {{composed}} of South Australian parliamentarians from four political parties.

The Committee received submissions from interested parties prior to 1 July 2016, and heard testimony {{from a range of}} witnesses. The Committee was expected to deliver the results of its considerations to the South Australian Parliament and ultimately concluded that no further public <b>money</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> spent pursuing the prospect of importing spent nuclear fuel to South Australia.|$|E
25|$|On 27 May 1787, he derailed {{yet another}} Polish policy which seemed {{threatening}} to Russia. With few major {{wars in the}} past decades, {{the economy of the}} Commonwealth was improving, and its budget had a notable surplus. Many voices said that the <b>money</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> spent on increasing the size, and providing new equipment for, the Polish army. However, as a large Polish army could be a threat to the Russian garrisons controlling Poland, von Stackelberg ordered his proxies in the Permanent Council to spend the money on a different goal: for the huge sum of 1 million zlotys (representing most of the surplus), the Council bought the von Brühl's Palace – and promptly donated it to 'Poland's ally', Russia, to serve as Russia's new embassy.|$|E

25|$|Lacking a party {{base in the}} Minnesota House of Representatives and Senate, Ventura's policy ambitions {{had little}} chance of being {{introduced}} as bills. Initially, the residents of Minnesota feared Ventura's vetoes would be overturned. He vetoed 45 bills in his first year, only three of which were overridden. The reputation for having his vetoes overridden comes from his fourth and final year, where six of his nine vetoes were overturned. Nevertheless, Ventura was still successful in several initiatives. One of the most notable was the rebate on sales tax. In each year of his administration, Minnesotans received a tax-free check in the late summer. The state was running a budget surplus at the time, and Ventura believed that the <b>money</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> returned to the public.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} to the encyclical's continued prohibitions of artificial birth control was very mixed. In Italy, Spain, Portugal and Poland, the encyclical was welcomed. In Latin America, much support developed for the Pope and his encyclical. As World Bank President Robert McNamara declared at the 1968 Annual Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group that countries permitting birth control practices would get preferential access to resources, doctors in La Paz, Bolivia called it insulting that <b>money</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> exchanged for the conscience of a Catholic nation. In Colombia, Cardinal archbishop Aníbal Muñoz Duque declared, if American conditionality undermines Papal teachings, we prefer not to receive one cent. The Senate of Bolivia passed a resolution stating that Humanae vitae could be discussed in its implications for individual consciences, but was of greatest significance because the papal document defended the rights of developing nations to determine their own population policies. The Jesuit Journal Sic dedicated one edition to the encyclical with supportive contributions.|$|E
25|$|Edge's {{second term}} as {{governor}} {{was marked by}} numerous battles with Hague. In 1944, Edge and Hague fought over how certain railroad tax <b>money</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> allocated (with Hague’s position ultimately prevailing), while Edge won the passage of legislation that required the use of voting machines in Hudson County to reduce the chance of electoral fraud. Edge also obtained legislation authorizing the governor to appoint jury commissioners for each county, bypassing county sheriffs, who had previously hand-picked grand jurors who they knew would refuse to indict those engaged in illegal activities protected by political bosses like Hague. The most important battle between Edge and Hague involved constitutional revision. In early 1944, Republican legislators drafted a new proposed constitution that would have, among other things, deprived Hague of {{a major source of}} patronage by restructuring the judiciary. Hague strongly opposed the revised constitution, and several weeks prior to the November 1944 election he launched a multi-pronged attack on it, charging that it would restrict the activities of labor unions, inhibit advancement opportunities for returning veterans, and subject all church owned property to taxation. Voters rejected the proposed constitution.|$|E

25|$|In July 1917, after {{consulting}} with architectural and artistic experts in London, Ware invited Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker, architects; Charles Aitken, {{director of the}} Tate Gallery; and author Sir James Barrie to tour British battlefield cemeteries near the front {{in an attempt to}} formulate broad ideas for the post-war design of these burying grounds. The trip began on 9 July. The group met formally on 14 July after the trip ended. Ware, Lutyens, and Baker agreed that every cemetery ought to obey a general theme (although the theme was not yet established), that there should only be four variations on the theme (monumental, garden or woodland, village, and town cemeteries), that grave markers should be uniform headstones (not crosses), and that cemetery walls should be horizontal. Aitken insisted on cemeteries of simple design and low cost, feeling public <b>money</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> spent on practical items like schools and hospitals. Baker wanted a cross at each cemetery, but Lutyens wanted a more abstract symbol. Aitken supported Baker in thinking that a cross was more appropriate in the French countryside. At one point, Baker suggested a cross with a pentagonal shaft (one side for each self-governing dominion), and for Indian cemeteries a column topped by appropriate symbol (such as the dharmacakra or Star of India).|$|E
25|$|An {{article in}} the American journal for Economics has {{addressed}} the issue of Utilitarian ethics within redistribution of wealth. The journal stated that taxation of the wealthy {{is the best way to}} make use of the disposable income they receive. This says that the money creates utility for the most people by funding government services. Many utilitarian philosophers, including Peter Singer and Toby Ord, argue that inhabitants of developed countries in particular have an obligation to help to end extreme poverty across the world, for example by regularly donating some of their income to charity. Peter Singer, for example, argues that donating some of one's income to charity could help to save a life or cure somebody from a poverty-related illness, which is a much better use of the money as it brings someone in extreme poverty far more happiness than it would bring to oneself if one lived in relative comfort. However, Singer not only argues that one ought to donate a significant proportion of one's income to charity, but also that this <b>money</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> directed to the most cost-effective charities, in order to bring about the greatest good for the greatest number, consistent with utilitarian thinking. Singer's ideas have formed the basis of the modern effective altruist movement.|$|E
500|$|Severance {{refers to}} the {{separation}} of charitable and non-charitable purposes, dividing the funds between them. This allows the charitable element to take effect. This is only possible when the trust instrument indicates that the donor intended for the fund to be divided, and cannot work where the donor gives a list of purposes a single fund {{is to be used}} for. The standard rule for dividing the funds is based on the equitable rule that [...] "equity is equality"; <b>money</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> divided equally. There are exceptions where it is not practicable, as in Re Coxon, where of a £200,000 gift to the City of London for charitable purposes, a £100 dinner and other small gifts to the board of trustees was funded.|$|E

500|$|The act forbade {{the company}} from issuing shares below £10 so, to make them easier for {{ordinary}} people to buy, they issued shilling coupons in books of ten {{so they could be}} paid for in instalments. [...] The construction costs and expected competition from the Port of Liverpool put off potential investors; by May 1887 only £3 million had been raised. As a temporary solution Thomas Walker, the contractor selected to construct the canal, agreed to accept £500,000 of the contract price in shares, but raising the remainder required another Act of Parliament to allow the company's share capital to be restructured as £3 million of ordinary shares and £4million of preference shares. Adamson was convinced that the <b>money</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> raised from members of the public and opposed the debt restructuring, resigning as chairman of the Ship Canal Committee on 1 February 1887. Barings and Rothschild jointly issued a prospectus for the sale of the preference shares on 15 July, and by 21 July the issue had been fully underwritten, allowing construction to begin.
