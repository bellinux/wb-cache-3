5|$|Unlike {{traditional}} Israeli historiography, Arab {{sources in}} general {{do not see}} it as {{a turning point in the}} war. They agree that the Egyptian declarations regarding Tel Aviv as the main strategic objective were ostentatious rather than operative. In his book 1948, New Historian Benny Morris also disagrees with the traditional Israeli view, and states that portraying the operation as the catalyst for the Egyptian halt is a mistake. However, in a March 15, 2007 panel of historians, <b>Morris</b> <b>said</b> that at least in the Egyptian expeditionary force, the Israeli attack did lead to a decision to stop advancing.|$|E

25|$|He went to France on {{business}} in 1789 {{and served as}} Minister Plenipotentiary to France from 1792 to 1794. His diaries during that time have become a valuable chronicle of the French Revolution, capturing much of the turbulence and violence of that era, as well as documenting his affairs with women there. Unlike Thomas Jefferson, Morris was far more critical of the French Revolution and considerably more sympathetic to the deposed queen consort, Marie Antoinette. Commenting on her grandfather’s sometimes Tory-minded outlook of the world, Anne Cary <b>Morris</b> <b>said,</b> “His creed was rather to form the government to suit the condition, character, manners, and habits of the people. In France this opinion led {{him to take the}} monarchical view, firmly believing that a republican form of government would not suit the French character.” The “French character” in the Age of Revolution was one of two socio-political extremes: absolutism and autocracy.|$|E

Ilan Pappé writes that the shelling culminated in an attack on a Palestinian crowd in the old marketplace using three-inch (76mm) mortars on 22 April 1948. Shabtai Levy, the Mayor of the city, and some other Jewish leaders urged Arabs not to leave.

While recording the album version, the record's producer Owen Morris cut out this intro {{and replaced it with}} a drumbeat played by McCarroll. Morris further cut a second section in Gallagher's guitar solo. Gallagher was bemused by Morris' decision, and jokingly asked him through manager Marcus Russell to [...] "not cut it in half again on the final mix".

500|$|The band {{refused to}} explain their lyrics {{to the press and}} did not print lyric sheets. Curtis told the fanzine Printed Noise, [...] "We haven't got a message really; the lyrics are open to interpretation. They're multidimensional. You can read into them what you like." [...] The other band members later {{admitted}} they paid little attention to what Curtis was writing. In a 1987 interview with Option, <b>Morris</b> <b>said</b> that they [...] "just thought the songs were sort of sympathetic and more uplifting than depressing. But everyone's got their own opinion." [...] Deborah Curtis recalled that only with the release of Closer did many who were close to the singer realise [...] "is intentions and feelings were all there within the lyrics". The surviving members of the band in retrospect regret not seeing warning signs in Curtis's lyrics. [...] "This sounds awful but it was only after Ian died that we sat down and listened to the lyrics", <b>Morris</b> <b>said</b> in 2007. [...] "You'd find yourself thinking, 'Oh my God, I missed this one'. Because I'd look at Ian's lyrics and think how clever he was putting himself in the position of someone else. I never believed he was writing about himself. Looking back, how could I have been so bleedin' stupid? Of course he was writing about himself. But I didn't go in and grab him and ask, 'What's up?'

500|$|On {{the first}} day of release, Be Here Now sold over 424,000 copies, {{becoming}} the fastest-selling album in British chart history, while initial reviews were overwhelmingly positive. Retrospectively, however, the album is viewed by many music journalists and fans and by most members of the band as over-indulgent and bloated. Q magazine, which gave the album a five-star review on its release, admitted in 2007 that Be Here Now is often thought of as [...] "a disastrous, overblown folly—the moment when Oasis, their judgement clouded by drugs and blanket adulation, ran aground on their own sky-high self-belief." [...] The album's producer Owen <b>Morris</b> <b>said</b> the recording sessions were marred by arguments and drug abuse, and that the band's only motivations were commercial. As of 2008, the album had sold eight million copies worldwide.|$|E
500|$|He {{returned}} to his pre-war clerical job at the Sydney Town Hall, but soon switched to a job with motor parts distributor Stack & Company, which allowed him more time for cricket commitments. Morris was automatically restored to the Sheffield Shield team in 1946–47 upon the resumption of competition. He made 27 and 98 in his first match against Queensland, and was selected for an Australian XI match against Wally Hammond's touring MCC team when first-choice opener Bill Brown was injured. In what was effectively a trial for the Test team, Morris scored 115 and featured in a 196-run partnership with Test captain Don Bradman, who scored 106. It was {{the beginnings of a}} productive cricketing relationship. <b>Morris</b> <b>said</b> of Bradman: [...] "He was marvellous. If you had a problem, you could go to him and sort it out.

500|$|Morris {{claimed the}} album was {{recorded}} in 15 days, at a pace of one song a day. [...] "Some Might Say" [...] proved problematic to record: the backing track was recorded in one take after Noel Gallagher and Morris drunkenly listened to the demo and decided the new version was played too fast, and Noel woke {{the rest of the}} band to re-record it. The backing track was faster than intended, with what Morris described as [...] "a really bad speed up during the first three bars of the first chorus", but the take had to be used because those involved were impressed with Liam's vocals, and Morris had to mix the track three times, using delay and other processing to hide the mistakes. When {{the album was}} finished, <b>Morris</b> <b>said</b> it would [...] "wipe the field with any competition... It's astonishing. It's the Bollocks for this decade." ...|$|E
500|$|The Washington Posts Dan Zak {{wrote that}} the film fails to provide laughs, scares, suspense, or gore.

Olsen also said the film failed to provide the [...] "giddiness", [...] "teenage lust", and [...] "rambunctiousness" [...] that made the previous Friday the 13th films work. Wesley <b>Morris</b> <b>said</b> Friday the 13th did have humor; he said the characters continually act the clichéd role of would-be-victim, {{making it hard to}} fear for their safety.

To me it's not as simple as: 'We liked it, so let's make another one.' What happens is you design these characters not so much looks-wise but as they are as characters and people for a story. So we'll explore it and see what happens." [...] In a July 2016 interview, Pixar president Jim <b>Morris</b> <b>said</b> that while demand for a sequel is high, the company has committed its resources to several original movie concepts from June 7, 2019 onward, and that no sequels to any of Pixar's other films including Inside Out were being contemplated at this time.|$|E

GamePros Dan <b>Morris</b> <b>said</b> [...] "As the single-player campaign builds to its final showdown, the ramifications of the final theoretical discoveries elevate Alpha Centauri from great strategy game to science-fiction epic." [...] Game Revolution said, [...] "The well crafted story, admirable science-fiction world, fully realized scenario, and quality core gameplay are sure to please." [...] Edge praised the uniqueness of expression saying it was [...] "the same kind of old-fashioned, consensual storytelling that once drew universes out of ASCII." [...] The in-game writing and faction leaders were also well-received for their believability, especially the voice acting. GameSpot reviewer Denny Atkin called the factions and their abilities Alpha Centauris [...] "most impressive aspect".
