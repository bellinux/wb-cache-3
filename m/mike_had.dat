5|$|Brooks' first {{venture into}} wrestling was {{a stint in}} a {{backyard}} wrestling federation called the Lunatic Wrestling Federation with his friends and brother Mike Brooks in the mid-late 1990s. He first started using the ring name CM Punk when he was put into a tag team named The Chick Magnets with CM Venom after another performer skipped out on the card. Unlike his friends, Punk genuinely {{wanted to be a}} wrestler and saw it as more than simple fun. When the promotion started taking off, doing shows out of a warehouse in Mokena, Illinois, Punk found out that his brother <b>Mike</b> <b>had</b> embezzled thousands of dollars from the small company, causing them to become estranged. They have not spoken since.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{a monster}} buddy for the lead monster emerged at an April 6, 1998 [...] "story summit" [...] in Burbank with {{employees}} from Disney and Pixar. A term coined by Lasseter, a [...] "story summit" [...] was a crash exercise that would yield a finished story in only two days. Such a character, the group agreed, would give the lead monster {{someone to talk to}} about his predicament. Development artist Ricky Nierva drew a concept sketch of a rounded, one-eyed monster as a concept for the character, and everyone was generally receptive to it. Docter named the character Mike for the father of his friend Frank Oz, a director and Muppet performer. Jeff Pidgeon and Jason Katz story-boarded a test in which Mike helps Sulley choose a tie for work, and Mike Wazowski soon became a vital character in the film. Originally, <b>Mike</b> <b>had</b> no arms and had to use his legs as appendages; however, due to some technical difficulties, arms were soon added to him.|$|E
500|$|The album {{features}} four guest artists; Rakim {{from the}} hip hop duo Eric B. & Rakim on [...] "Guilty All the Same", Page Hamilton from the American alternative metal band Helmet on [...] "All for Nothing", Daron Malakian from System of a Down for the song [...] "Rebellion" [...] and Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine fame on the song [...] "Drawbar". Bennington commented on the collaborations, stating that [...] "We really felt like {{if we need to}} be inspired and move in another direction. I think when we got Page in, <b>Mike</b> <b>had</b> written this chorus and sang it, and his voice had this tone, and it was unlike anything I'd heard from him before. And I was like, [...] "Dude this is crazy, this sounds like a Helmet song! It's cool!" [...] And we were like, [...] "Dude, why don't we {{see if we can get}} like Page in here?" [...] You know? And if that's why the song says it's feeling like it should be, then why don't we just go straight to the source".|$|E
50|$|During {{the last}} decade <b>Mike</b> <b>has</b> also visited the United States, and most of Europe, as George Russell's guitarist, {{recording}} with him on several occasions.

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly called the five-year jump [...] "a stroke of genius, effectively increasing our insight into these ladies' world by twofold." [...] He called the Gabrielle storyline a true depiction of motherhood and applauded {{the scene in}} which Carlos and Gabrielle discuss her low self-esteem. He complimented the Bree storyline, particularly the argument scene between Bree and Katherine. He enjoyed the Dave storyline, but expressed disappointment that Edie's reappearance was the only scene that involved all of the leading women. Additionally, Stransky was not intrigued by Lynette's storyline and deemed it [...] "more of the same" [...] for the character. He criticized Susan's storyline, calling it annoying. He also dismissed the writers' ploy to give viewers the impression that <b>Mike</b> <b>had</b> died for almost the entire episode. TV Guide Matt Roush gave the episode an 'A', stating, [...] "Moving the story ahead five years didn't so much reinvent the show as it recharged and refreshed the scintillating mix of domestic comedy and sudsy intrigue that we've always enjoyed." [...] He highlighted the comedic Gabrielle storyline while approving the additions of McDonough and Harold to the cast.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 April 2004 Oldfield {{launched}} his next virtual reality project, Maestro, which contains {{music from the}} Tubular Bells 2003 album and some new chillout melodies.

2500|$|Mike later married Nancy Pollock (Ann Flood), a {{journalist}} who helped in many of his cases. Other important characters were Police Chief Bill Marceau (Mandel Kramer), {{who was one of}} Karr's best friends and shared a tremendous mutual respect, rare between a defense attorney and a chief of police (perhaps because <b>Mike</b> <b>had</b> once been a police officer himself), Marceau's secretary (and later wife) Martha (Teri Keane), fellow attorney Adam Drake (Donald May), his client, then secretary (and later on, his wife) Nicole Travis (Maeve McGuire; Jayne Bentzen; Lisa Sloan), and wealthy socialite Geraldine Whitney (Lois Kibbee).

2500|$|The strip resumed {{some time}} after {{the events in the}} musical, with further changes having taken place {{after the end of the}} musical's plot. While Mike, Mark, Zonker, B.D., and Boopsie were all now graduates, B.D. and Boopsie were living in Malibu, California, where B.D. was a third-string quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams, and Boopsie was making a living from walk-on and cameo roles. Mark was living in Washington, DC, working for National Public Radio. Michael and J.J. had gotten married, and <b>Mike</b> <b>had</b> dropped out of {{business}} school to start work in an advertising agency in New York City. Zonker, still not ready for the [...] "real world", was living with Mike and J.J. until he was accepted as a medical student at his Uncle Duke's [...] "Baby Doc College" [...] in Haiti.|$|E
2500|$|Van Sant {{showed the}} script to an {{executive}} at 20th Century Fox who liked Shakespeare. Eventually, he toned down the Shakespeare and made the language more modern. Van Sant was also working on a short story called [...] "My Own Private Idaho" [...] which he intended to film. It was 25 pages long and was about two Latino characters {{on the streets of}} Portland who go in search of their parents and travel to a town in Spain. One of them {{falls in love with a}} girl and leaves the other behind. Van Sant had another script called The Boys of Storytown, which had the Mike and Scott characters and <b>Mike</b> <b>had</b> narcolepsy. The characters of Hans and Bob were also present.

While editing Drugstore Cowboy, Van Sant combined the scripts for Modern Days and Storytown with the [...] "Idaho" [...] short story.|$|E
2500|$|Elvis was a keen karate {{student and}} persuaded Priscilla {{to take it}} up. Priscilla {{thought it was a}} good idea, as it would pass the time she spent alone if she had a hobby on which to concentrate, and she was also keen to share in Elvis' interests. Following {{suggestions}} from Elvis, Priscilla began taking lessons from Mike Stone, a karate instructor she had met in 1972 backstage at one of Elvis' concerts. She soon began an affair with him. Priscilla states in her book, [...] "My relationship with <b>Mike</b> <b>had</b> now developed into an affair. I still loved Elvis greatly, but over the next few months I knew I would have to make a crucial decision regarding my destiny." [...] She later states [...] "Elvis must have perceived my new restlessness." [...] A couple of months later, she said that Elvis had requested to see her in his hotel suite. It was then that she writes in her book that Elvis [...] "forcefully made love to me... 'This is how a real man makes love to his woman.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the melee, the sitdowners and {{supporters}} (who promptly {{arrived on the}} scene) marched back to the East End, smashing {{the windows of the}} Woodward's and Spencer's department stores and other targets en route, causing $35,000 damage. As in 1935, the Ukrainian Labour Temple served as a makeshift hospital for protesters with the assistance of volunteer doctors and medical supplies that had been collected as an aid package destined for China. Steve Brodie was targeted for particularly brutal treatment by the police and was left with a permanent eye injury. Another man, former militia sergeant Arthur Redseth, slipped on the post office floor during the fracas. [...] "Little Mike", a fellow Serb, managed to drag Redseth out of the building to safety through the flailing police clubs but only after Redseth's eye was knocked out of its socket under the gauntlet of police clubs. Redseth was later rejected for military service in the Second World War because of his injury, after which he became despondent and committed suicide in 1942. Little <b>Mike</b> <b>had</b> only required five stitches to his jaw from an injury he received after asking a police officer to call an ambulance for his friend. He died the same year as Redseth at Dieppe.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking to The Sun {{newspaper}} in June 2008, Swash {{has talked about}} his dissatisfaction with the direction the producers had taken Mickey. In Swash's opinion, Mickey had only been used for [...] "light relief" [...] since September 2005, when Swash was forced to take a three-month break from the serial after he contracted meningoencephalitis — a rare form of viral meningitis, which makes the brain swell up. EastEnders writers were reported to be [...] "frantically reworking scripts" [...] to explain Mickey's sudden disappearance, and according to Swash, this meant that a big storyline concentrating {{on the relationship between}} Mickey and his estranged father <b>Mike</b> <b>had</b> to be cut. He has commented, [...] "My illness had a massive impact on my job. When I came back I couldn’t find my feet. New producers came in and brought in new actors and I got lost down the pecking order [...] Ever since I came back, I’ve had nothing regular. As an actor you want storylines to stretch yourself. To be fair, I didn't work as much when the Miller family arrived in 2004. When it was just Mickey, I got really good stuff. I was over the moon about the family but producers needed to concentrate on developing their characters and I had to take a back seat [...] Mickey just became light relief – the joker. That’s all right but I’ve got more ambition. I would have stayed for ages if I had good stuff, but I wasn’t getting the work [...] I wasn't that upset when I was told [...] I kind of predicted it [...] My character hadn’t been working out for ages [...] it will be a relief not to be Mickey Miller any more!" ...|$|E
