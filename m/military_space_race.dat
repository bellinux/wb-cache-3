40|$|The <b>Space</b> <b>Race</b> {{during the}} Cold War was {{an era when}} the World saw great {{possibilities}} and scientific discoveries. Before 1957, the thing we call space had never been scaled by man. The Soviet Union turned this over with Sputnik 1, the very first artificial satellite which would change our way to research everything beyond Earth. Although this is true, there is also another side of <b>Space</b> <b>Race</b> which has more or less {{nothing to do with}} space at all – the politics. There is no denying that the politics about <b>Space</b> <b>Race</b> was far more essential for the United States and the Soviet Union than any scientific research. Kennedy talked about prestige and to “be ahead” in the <b>race</b> for <b>space.</b> Of course, the Americans and the Russians were fully involved and knew what could be gained from winning the race. But what about other nations? What about the Swedes? This thesis brings the <b>Space</b> <b>Race</b> to Sweden and examines two Swedish newspapers to get a clear view on how the people of Sweden actually encountered <b>Space</b> <b>Race.</b> To narrow the thesis down, the author picked two important events where the political side of <b>Space</b> <b>Race</b> is distinct – Yuri Gagarin’s orbit of the Earth in 1961 and John Glenn’s orbit of the Earth in 1962. What kind of position in the <b>Space</b> <b>Race</b> did Sweden have, and how is it reflected in the newspapers? Does the political differences in two leading tabloids affect the outcome of the articles? And which kind of theories about the Cold War could be applied on these tabloids? This kind of research is uncommon to encounter in Sweden, but it ought to be dealt with here...|$|R

In particular, the US Department of Defense (DoD) Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) of the early 1980 s is shown to result in a changing structure of the <b>space</b> <b>race.</b> This is expected to continue in the future with the current anti-ballistic missile (ABM) programme and the withdrawal of the US from the ABM treaty of on space militarization. <b>Space</b> expenditure, <b>Space</b> <b>race,</b> Strategic Defense Initiative,...|$|R
