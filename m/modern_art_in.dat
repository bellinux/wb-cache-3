5|$|The work {{dates from}} Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition, and is {{regarded}} by art critics as revolutionary {{both as a}} progression of pop art and {{as a work of}} <b>modern</b> <b>art</b> <b>in</b> general.

Fourteen initial games were announced in November 2012, with plans to expand the collection to up to forty games over time, as the museum is able to acquire the display rights for them. Six more games were added to the collection in June 2013, as well a game console.|$|E
5|$|Developing an {{interest}} in <b>modern</b> <b>art,</b> <b>in</b> the early 1960s Hergé befriended the art dealer Marcel Stal, owner of the Carrefour gallery in Brussels. He was a particular fan {{of the work of}} Constant Permeke, Jakob Smits, Lucio Fontana, and Jean-Pierre Raynaurd, as well as the pop art movement, in particular the work of Roy Lichtenstein. He built up his own personal collection, which consisted of both modern paintings as well as African art and Chinese ceramics.|$|E

5|$|The Albert Dock {{was officially}} re-opened in 1988 by The Prince of Wales, the great-great-great-grandson of Prince Albert, {{the man who}} had {{originally}} opened the docks. It was timed to coincide {{with the opening of the}} newly finished Tate Liverpool, which was dubbed the 'Tate of the north' and at the time the only one outside London. The decision to locate a Tate gallery in Liverpool was seen as a major success for the city, as it made Liverpool home to the National Collection of <b>modern</b> <b>art</b> <b>in</b> the North of England.|$|E
5|$|The {{interaction}} between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which {{began to be}} exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence {{on the development of}} <b>modern</b> <b>art</b> <b>in</b> the West, most notably on post-Impressionism. Famous ukiyo-e artists include Hokusai and Hiroshige. Hokusai coined the term manga. Japanese comics now known as manga developed in the 20th century and have become popular worldwide. Japanese animation is called anime. Japanese-made video game consoles have been popular since the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Following LeRoy's {{death in}} 1932, his film {{collection}} {{was bought by}} the Museum of <b>Modern</b> <b>Art</b> <b>in</b> 1936. The museum's acquisition and subsequent screenings of A Trip to the Moon, {{under the direction of}} MoMA's film curator Iris Barry, opened the film up once again to a wide audience of Americans and Canadians and established it definitively as a landmark in the history of cinema. LeRoy's incomplete print became the most commonly seen version of the film and the source print for most other copies, including the Cinémathèque française's print. A complete version of the film, including the entire celebration sequence, was finally reconstructed in 1997 from various sources by the Cinémathèque Méliès, a foundation set up by the Méliès family.|$|E

In the United Kingdom, {{distributor}} Artificial Eye released the film theatrically in December 2008, 18 months following its Cannes premiere.

5|$|Gaudí's {{reputation}} {{was beginning to}} recover by the 1950s, when his work was championed not only by Salvador Dalí but also by architect Josep Lluís Sert. In 1952, the centenary year of the architect's birth, the Asociación de Amigos de Gaudí (Friends of Gaudí Association) was founded {{with the aim of}} disseminating and conserving his legacy. Four years later, a retrospective was organised at the Saló del Tinell in Barcelona, and the Gaudí Chair at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia was created with the purpose of deepening the study of the Gaudí's works and participating in their conservation. These events were followed in 1957 by Gaudí's first international exhibition, held at the Museum of <b>Modern</b> <b>Art</b> <b>in</b> New York City. In 1976, on the 50th anniversary of his death, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs organised an exhibition about Gaudí and his works that toured the globe.|$|E

5|$|In August 2007, reports emerged {{suggesting}} My Bloody Valentine would reunite for the 2008 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California, United States. Similar reports had {{circulated in}} 2003, stating that Shields, Butcher and Ó Cíosóig were together in Berlin, Germany, re-recording five songs recorded for Glider, which were due for release on an upcoming box set; and in 2007, reports suggested My Bloody Valentine {{were due to}} perform at a series of Pod-organised concerts at the Irish Museum of <b>Modern</b> <b>Art</b> <b>in</b> Kilmainham, Dublin. Shields later confirmed the reunion {{and said that the}} band's third studio album, which he had begun recording in 1996, was near completion. Three live shows in the United Kingdom were announced in November 2007 and on 13 June 2008, My Bloody Valentine performed in public {{for the first time in}} 16 years during two live rehearsals at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London.|$|E
5|$|The philosopher, sociologist, {{town planner}} and writer Patrick Geddes (1854–1932) coined the phrase Scottish Renaissance in his {{magazine}} Evergreen. He argued that technological development {{needed to be}} in parallel with the arts. These ideas were taken up by a new generation, led by the poet Hugh MacDiarmid who argued for a synergy between science and art, the introduction of modernism into art {{and the creation of}} a distinctive national art. These ideas were expressed in art in the inter-war period by figures including Stanley Cursiter (1887–1976), William McCance (1894–1970), William Johnstone (1897–1981) and Fergusson. Stanley Cursiter was influenced by the Celtic revival, post-impressionism and Futurism, as can be seen in his Rain on Princess Street (1913) and Regatta (1913). He went on to be a major painter of the coastline of this native Orkney, director of the National Gallery of Scotland and proposed the creation of a National Gallery of <b>Modern</b> <b>Art</b> <b>in</b> 1930. Fergusson was one of the few British artists who could claim to have played a part in the creation of modernism and probably played a major part in the formulation of MacDiarmid's thought. His interest in machine imagery can be seen in paintings like Damaged Destroyer (1918). He co-operated with MacDiarmid on the journal Scottish Art and Letters and MacDiarmid quoted extensively from his work.|$|E
