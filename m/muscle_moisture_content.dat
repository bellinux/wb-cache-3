40|$|ABSTRACT The {{present study}} was carried out to {{investigate}} the influence of freezing-thawing cycles (0, 2, 4 and 6) on lipid oxidation and myowater contents and distribution. Nine replicates of chicken breast meat samples were used for each cycle. Lipid oxidation was determined by measuring peroxide value, and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations, which reflect thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS). Color was determined with a digital colorimeter. <b>Muscle</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> were determined by drip loss and thawing loss, water holding capacity, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The results showed that, {{as the number of}} freeze-thaw cycles increased, meat redness decreased and MDA and peroxide values increased. Drip loss and thawing loss tended to decreasing as the number of freeze-thaw cycles increased. Water holding capacity also decreased as a function of increasing freeze-thaw cycles. NMR relaxometry profile showed freeze-thaw cycles change the water distribution of meat subjected to multiple freeze-thaw cycles. In conclusion, multiple freezing and thawing rate (6 cycles) increased lipid oxidation, decreased myowater, and impaired the color of chicken meat...|$|R

Control diet lysine content was 2. 1 % of dry matter (4. 4 % of dietary protein). Three experimental diets were prepared by adding lysine (0. 5, 1 and 1. 5 %) to control diet to obtain diets containing 2. 6, 3. 1 and 3. 6 % of dry matter lysine (corresponding to 5. 5, 6. 6 and 7. 6 of dietary protein). Fish were fed 2. 6 % of dry matter lysine showed significantly higher final weight, weight gain and SGR and lower FCR {{compared to other}} treatments. There was no significant change in food intake and survival between treatments. Lysine supplementation resulted significantly in increase and decrease in muscle protein and lipid, respectively.

40|$|Regional {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} patterns of soil moisture were investigated using Oklahoma Mesonet (OKMesonet) heat dissipation sensor observations and ETA modeled volumetric soil <b>moisture</b> <b>contents.</b> The investigation focused only on the summer season (June to August) of 1998 at 37 Oklahoma Mesonet stations, which were {{selected on the basis}} of data quality. The 30 -minute OKMesonet heat dissipation sensor temperature change and its associated matric potential estimation were downloaded from CODIAC. Modeled volumetric soil <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> (ETA) were extracted by selecting the node closest to each OKMesonet site. OKMesonet volumetric soil <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> were estimated from OKMesonet matric potentials, using a soil-water retention curve estimated from the relationship between ETA volumetric soil <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> versus OKMesonet matric potentials. This forces the observed data to fall within the range of modeled data and to behave like an ideal soil, thereby removing any bias that might actually exist between modeled and observed data while allowing soil water content to be plotted as a function of time. The temporal and spatial patterns of volumetric soil <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> and rainfall during the summer were examined for the modeled and OKMesonet observational data. Rainfall data from the ETA model were not available for this study. Volumetric soil <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> is higher in the eastern part of Oklahoma and steadily decreases to the west. Six distinct events were always present in the modeled soil <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> while the number of events is spatially variable in the observed 01 CMesonet soil <b>moisture</b> <b>content.</b> The OKMesonet rainfall shows a very similar pattern to volumetric soil <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> implying a close correlation between the two. Summer average modeled volumetric soil <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> is about 0. 3 m 31 m 3 higher than OKMesonet soil <b>moisture</b> <b>content.</b> However, the temporal patterns of modeled and OKMesonet soil <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> are often in good agreement. This suggests that the ETA model does not overestimate soil <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> but rather that the ETA generates unnaturally uniform soil moisture amounts throughout Oklahoma, which result in anomalously high volumetric soil <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> in the ETA model...|$|R
40|$|<b>Moisture</b> <b>content</b> of rubberwood is an {{important}} factor influencing its physical and mechanical behaviours. This research aimed at quantifying effect of <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> on physical and mechanical properties of juvenile rubberwood core. The specimens at various <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> were tested in compression and shear parallel to grain. Information was gathered to determine shrinkage, density and specific gravity of specimens. The equilibrium <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> determined from desorption experiment, was well described by the Hailwood-Horrobin solution theory. <b>Moisture</b> <b>content</b> of 23 + 4 % best represented the value of apparent fiber saturation point, Mp, determined from physical and mechanical properties data. Above Mp, values of all physical and mechanical properties examined were fairly constant. Maximum volumetric shrinkage from <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> above Mp to an oven-dry condition was 8. 2 + 1. 8 %. Specific gravity and density were 0. 55 + 0. 03 and 614 + 30 kg/m 3 at 12 % <b>moisture</b> <b>content.</b> Below Mp, ultimate compressive stress (UCS) parallel to grain, ultimate shear stress parallel to grain, modulus of elasticity (MOE) for compression parallel to grain, and shear modulus parallel to grain increased exponentially with decreasing <b>moisture</b> <b>content.</b> Shear strain at fracture and work to fracture of shear parallel to grain were found to increase as <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> decreased below Mp and attained the maximum values at 20 % and 12 % <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> respectively. The values decreased with further lowering of the level of <b>moisture</b> <b>content.</b> Ultimate compressive stress (UCS) parallel to grain was closely correlated with specific gravity and was more sensitive to changes in <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> at higher specific gravity level...|$|R

From Fig.  8, when the assumed value of <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> is half of the true value (0.5 on the horizontal axis), the estimation accuracy of MOE 15 (ASTM) becomes 1.04 [*]±[*] 0.13; in contrast, when the assumed value of <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> is 1.5 times (1.5 on the horizontal axis), the estimation accuracy of MOE becomes 1.37 [*]±[*] 0.26. For instance, in a full-scale timber of 80 % <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> MOE is estimated by assuming the <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> as 40 %. Although the assumed <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> is incorrect, the estimated value is about the same as the observed value. As mentioned above, this is because the Young’s modulus derived via the Monte Carlo method without measuring the density has been overestimated about 20 %. This point is offset by having underestimated the <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> the resulting estimation accuracy hence improves. Conversely, assuming 120 % <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> on an 80 % <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> of a full-scale timber to estimate MOE, the value is being overestimated by about 40 %. For this result, the difference in the measurement position is hardly found.|$|R

Seed roundness and sphericity decreased linearly from 95. 2 to 81. 7 % and 83. 9 to 79 % respectively as <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> increased. One thousand seed weight increased from 400. 9 to 423. 1 g as <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> increased. As <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> increased from 5. 3 % to 29. 6 % (d. b) bulk density decreased from 0. 676 to 0. 593 g/cm 3 while true density and porosity increased from 1. 077 to 1. 11 g/cm 3 and 37. 2 to 46. 5 % respectively. Angle of repose increased from 22. 3 to 32. 6 o as <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> increased.

Results suggest that TDR is an effective way of monitoring relative changes in the <b>moisture</b> <b>content.</b> Measurement of absolute <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> is more complicated as it requires a calibration function, and the existing empirical relationships used in the soil sciences consistently overestimate the <b>moisture</b> <b>content.</b> A semi-empirical calibration relationship {{has been found to}} offer a better approach to absolute <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> evaluation with TDR.
