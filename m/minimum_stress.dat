50|$|The {{torsion spring}} in this staple remover is a {{standardised}} component {{that appears in}} many other products, such as clothes pegs. It has two loops. The spring is made of chrome-plated steel, which is used {{because there is a}} point of <b>minimum</b> <b>stress</b> where continued use (opening and closing the staple remover) will not cause failure through fatigue. They are mass-produced by a spring winding machine which cold winds wire around an arbour before heat treating to make it harder. The spring is then chrome plated. The machinery to do this is large, expensive, but has a high production rate. That is why the springs are usually bought off-the-shelf from a tier 1 supplier rather than produced in house.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two types}} of seep that can occur, {{depending}} on the degree of overpressure. [...] Capillary failure can occur in moderate overpressure conditions, resulting in widespread but low intensity seepage until the overpressure equalizes and resealing occurs. In some cases, the moderate overpressure cannot be equalized because the pores in the rock are small so the displacement pressure, the pressure required to break the seal, is very high. If the overpressure continues to increase {{to the point that it}} overcomes the rock's <b>minimum</b> <b>stress</b> and its tensile strength before overcoming the displacement pressure, then the rock will fracture, causing local and high intensity seepage until the pressure equalizes and the fractures close.|$|E

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} {{examines}} the effect of mean stress on the fatigue behaviour of very hard (Rockwell C 60) steels (AISI 8822, 8620, 9310, and cold-worked pre-stressing wire). In the mean stress tests, the <b>minimum</b> <b>stress</b> in the fatigue cycle was varied from test to test over a range from - 1200 MPa to a value approaching the true fracture stress of each material. The results are not adequately explained by current theories for the effect of mean stress on fatigue behaviour {{in the region of}} compressive mean stresses. All current theories suggest that the maximum stress at the fatigue limit decreases with decreasing <b>minimum</b> <b>stress.</b> The results of this study shows that instead of continuing to decrease with decreasing <b>minimum</b> <b>stress</b> the maximum stress at the fatigue limit remains constant indicating an insensitivity to the <b>minimum</b> <b>stress</b> in the fatigue cycle for minimum stresses below the value in a fully reversed fatigue test. The theory proposed by the author corrects this error by maintaining the maximum stress at the fatigue limit constant with decreasing <b>minimum</b> <b>stress</b> in the region of negative mean stresses. The results are of interest to designers of components in which high negative residual stresses are introduced into materials hardened by, for example, carburizing, nitriding, or induction hardening to improve the fatigue strength of components. The present work allows considerably higher design stresses for operating stresses in the negative mean stress region than previous theories permit...|$|E

40|$|The present {{paper is}} the first to propose a <b>minimum</b> <b>stress</b> {{criterion}} for the minimum dimensional variation during sheet metal assembly. The weld sequence affects the dimensional variation owing to the welding process. A case study illustrates the <b>minimum</b> <b>stress</b> criterion on dimensional variation. This paper proposes a generic design criterion for sheet metal products and processes that would produce minimal stress-induced dimensional variation for spot-welded sheet metal assemblies. The process design proposes a <b>minimum</b> <b>stress</b> build-up by using the `sheet metal ironing welding technique' in the weld sequencing design. The product design proposes a <b>minimum</b> <b>stress</b> build-up design criterion to manage the accumulation of stress. The proposed product and process design methods enable automotive body design engineers to create a quality product with minimum dimensional variation caused by the manufacturing stress within the body-in-white structure. Moreover, this facilitates the industry's objective of building a high quality automotive body with <b>minimum</b> <b>stress.</b> This {{is an important factor in}} contributing to the superior quality of the body panel fits. It also helps to reduce the quality-related warranty costs. This paper primarily focuses on the development of a joint design guideline by exploring the relationship between the dimensional variation and the stress build-up. First, the automotive assembly process design will be introduced. A simple analysis of a one-dimensional assembly is produced. A three-dimensional structural analysis of a box assembly is investigated for the effect of stress build-up within a structure on the dimensional instability or variation. Then a three-dimensional finite element analysis of an assembly with weld sequencing of two imaginary parts is produced. An experimental industrial trial has confirmed the validity of the simulation methodology. Then a welding sequence design guideline is produced based on the previous simulation result, followed by a joint design guideline to help improve the design of dimensionally robust design.

30|$|The {{increasing}} {{trend of}} the maximum injection pressure cannot be explained by elevated <b>minimum</b> <b>stress</b> {{as a result of}} injection. Pressure falloff analysis indicates that the <b>minimum</b> <b>stress</b> only rises about 10  psi after each batch injection. For a case of 12 -h injection at a flow rate of 10  bbl/min for 12  h, injection pressure calculated from diffusivity equation is about 1900  psi. The calculation is confirmed by the well test data, suggesting that fracture propagation pressure is around 1910  psi. The increased maximum injection pressure is, therefore, more likely related to a higher solid concentration within the fracture than perceived.|$|E

30|$|Ignoring the {{interaction}} between the fracture and the wellbore (in the analytical model), the stress induced by the first fracture is relatively high in the wellbore direction. The theoretical method overestimates the induced stress in the horizontal wellbore direction. The induced stress in the y-axis direction decreases rapidly. However, the induced stress around the wellbore is affected by the wellbore. Generally, the induced <b>stress</b> in the <b>minimum</b> horizontal <b>stress</b> direction is greater than that in the maximum horizontal stress direction, so the difference between the maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>stresses</b> will reduce. The fracture may turn when the stress difference reaches a certain value. This would provide favorable conditions for creating complex fractures and communicating with natural fractures in the propagation of hydraulically induced fractures.|$|R

30|$|Fracture {{gradient}} {{is defined}} by the Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary as the pressure gradient required to induce fractures in the rock at a given depth. Based on this definition, the fracture gradient is the maximum mud weight that a well can hold without mud losses and without uncontrolled tensile failures (fracture growth). However, there is no consensus for a method to calculate the fracture gradient in the oil and gas industry. Some pore pressure specialists use the <b>minimum</b> <b>stress</b> gradient as the fracture gradient, but others may use the maximum leak-off pressure gradient (fracture breakdown pressure gradient) or the fracture initiation pressure gradient as the fracture gradient. In this paper, the maximum leak-off pressure gradient (the peak value in the LOT test) is used as the fracture gradient.

In this study, the impulsive stress was analyzed by the dynamic finite element method using a 3 -dimensional model of the femur, {{and the influence of}} the fall configuration on the stress was discussed. The stress was concentrated around the femoral neck during the propagation of the stress wave, and the tensile maximum principal stress changed into compressive <b>minimum</b> principle <b>stress</b> on the anterior and medial sides of the neck.
