It was Laura Nelson hanging from a bridge, caught so pitiful and tattered and beyond retrieving—like a paper kite sagged on a utility wire." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series co-creator Ryan Murphy and {{directed}} by Bradley Buecker. Two months before it aired, Murphy confirmed at PaleyFest 2011 {{that there was a}} death planned {{before the end of the}} season, but that it would not be recurring character Dave Karofsky, despite rumors that his death would be paving the way for Kurt's return to McKinley High. Further details were eventually supplied by entertainment reporter Michael Ausiello, who reported on April 19, 2011 that a [...] "beloved character" [...] would be dying in the [...] "season's penultimate episode", and one week later that the character was female. Morrison confirmed in late April that there would indeed be a death, and added: [...] "The episode right before the finale is called 'Funeral'. We were actually at a funeral home yesterday, shooting all day. It was a very taxing day." [...] The day the episode aired, Lynch revealed in an interview that Murphy had conferred with her before proceeding with the storyline: [...] "He took <b>me</b> <b>aside</b> at a party and said 'I want your blessing on this before we move forward.' I said, 'It sounds like a really great storyline.' It’s the thing that will break Sue Sylvester’s heart and get to where she lives." [...] Lynch was nominated for an Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards for her work on the show, and submitted [...] "Funeral" [...] to be the episode by which she would be judged.|$|E

When I met up with Blues officials later that day I had both my hands bandaged and found it hard to sign the contract!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the decades}} that followed, many comedy stars, {{including}} Milton Berle, Bob Hope, and Red Skelton, cited Healy {{as a mentor}} and significant influence on their careers. [...] "Back in 1925, Ted Healy took <b>me</b> <b>aside</b> and gave me some wonderful advice," [...] Berle told Walter Winchell, in 1955. [...] "'Milton, always play to the public. Never mind playing to the theatrical crowd. Don't try to impress the trumpet player in the pit. Entertain the people and you'll get rich and famous.' [...] " [...] Alex Gard's caricature of Healy {{was the first of}} several hundred displayed at Sardi's restaurant in New York City's Theater District.|$|E

Later in the half he pushed <b>me</b> <b>aside</b> to score a try, but I could at least claim to have cut him down once." [...] Following the Test Campese and Lomu met in the changing rooms and exchanged their jerseys. Lomu gave Campese his number 11 jersey while Campese gave Lomu his number 16 jersey. Campese's 92nd Test marked the last Test he would play in the amateur era.|$|E

Both political supporters and opponents remarked on DeLay's ability to sway the votes of his party, a method DeLay described as [...] "growing the vote". DeLay was noted for involving lobbyists {{in the process of}} passing House bills. One lobbyist said, [...] "I've had members pull <b>me</b> <b>aside</b> and ask me to talk to another member of Congress about a bill or amendment, but I've never been asked to work on a bill—at least like they are asking us to whip bills now." [...] His ability to raise money gave him additional influence. During the 2004 election cycle, DeLay's political action committee ARMPAC was one of the top contributors to Republican congressional candidates, contributing over $980,000 in total.|$|E
