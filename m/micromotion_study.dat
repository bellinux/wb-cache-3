In this department, all processes are still done manually using human power, consist of labeling process, pillbox packaging process, and dozen packaging process. The consequence, a good standard method should {{be needed to}} do these processes. The Two-Hand Process Chart and <b>micromotion</b> <b>study</b> are {{used to analyze the}} present method. Based on this analysis, the methods improvement is done to find a better method to do the packaging process. The improvements include the revision of hand motions that are categorized as ineffective motion in each process and the design of temporary box as a tool for dozen packaging process.

40|$|The {{assumption}} that vocational aptitude changed {{with age and}} {{with the kind of}} occupation was examined from the tendency of the fitted curve for the score of the aptitude test. 9 vocational aptitudes were measured by the general vocational aptitude test by Japan Labor Ministry. Subjects were 382 male workers (design engineers, turners, welders, can manufacturing workers, and crane operators) of from 20 to 59 years old, and 348 male and female students (junior high school, vocational school, and university) of from 15 to 19 years old. The design engineers' aptitudes advanced along the quadratic curve until 31 years old, but almost all the aptitudes of the other workers fell along the linear curve with age. The design engineers preserved various aptitudes until 52 years old, the turners 44, and the welders, the can manufacturing workers, and the crane operators 37. The students' aptitudes were equal to those of the workers of from 15 to 25 years old. The workers preserved Spatial aptitude and Numerical aptitude until 45 years old. This could be said in all the occupations here. Further it was made clear from the <b>micromotion</b> <b>study</b> that the influence of age was caused by therblig...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The new {{generation}} short-stem hip implants {{are designed to}} encourage physiological-like loading, to minimize stress–strain shielding and therefore implant loosening in the long term. As yet there are no long-term clinical studies available to prove the benefits of these short-stem implants. Owing to this lack of clinical data, numerical simulation {{may be used as}} a predictor of longer term behaviour. This finite element study predicted both the primary stability and long-term stability of a short-stem implant. The primary implant stability was evaluated in terms of interface <b>micromotion.</b> This <b>study</b> found primary stability to fall within the critical threshold for osseointegration to occur. Longer term stability was evaluated using a strain-adaptive bone remodelling algorithm to predict the long-term behaviour of the bone in terms of bone mineral density (BMD) changes. No BMD loss was observed in the classical Gruen zones 1 and 7 and bone remodelling patterns were comparable with hip resurfacing results in the literature...|$|R
30|$|In {{an effort}} to utilize the {{desirable}} features of the Paul trap system to study the 2 D physics, arrays of Paul traps are being pursued [17 – 22]. It {{has also been shown}} that effective higher-dimensional models may be programmed into a simulator with a linear crystal if sufficient control of the laser fields can be achieved [23]. In this article, we study an alternative approach to applying Paul traps to the simulation of frustrated 2 D spin lattices. We consider a Paul trap with axial symmetry that forms an oblate potential, squeezing the ions into a 2 D crystal. The micromotion in this case is purely radial due to symmetry, and lasers that propagate perpendicular to the crystal plane will therefore not be sensitive to Doppler shifts from <b>micromotion.</b> We <b>study</b> the parameter space of a particular model trap geometry to find the crystal structures, normal modes, and programmable spin-spin interactions for 2 D triangular crystals in this trap. We find a wide parameter space for making such crystals, and an Ising spin-spin interaction with widely-tunable range, suitable for studying spin frustration and dynamics on triangular lattices with tens of ions.|$|R
40|$|We <b>study</b> <b>micromotion</b> in {{two-dimensional}} periodically driven {{systems in}} which all bulk Floquet eigenstates are localized by disorder. We show that this micromotion {{gives rise to a}} quantized time-averaged magnetization density when the system is filled with fermions. Furthermore we find that a quantized current flows around the boundary of any filled region of finite extent. The quantization has a topological origin: we relate the time-averaged magnetization density to the winding number characterizing the new phase identified in Phys. Rev. X 6, 021013 (2016). We thus establish that the winding number invariant can be accessed directly in bulk measurements, and propose an experimental protocol to do so using interferometry in cold atom based realizations.

40|$|Periprosthetic osteolysis {{involves}} {{osteoclast activation}} by wear particulates and {{their exposure to}} mechanical perturbation through exposure to shear forces generated by periprosthetic fluid as well as interface <b>micromotion.</b> This <b>study</b> aimed to determine the interactions between wear particulates, mechanical stimulation, and osteoclasts. In static cultures, wear particulates increased osteoclast differentiation. Addition of neutralizing antibodies to RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa ligand) inhibited the particle-induced increase in osteoclast numbers. Cyclic 5000 microstrains were applied {{with the use of}} a custom-built device to marrow-derived cultures to assess the effect on osteoclast differentiation. Mechanical strain application alone decreased osteoclast differentiation, which was further decreased by the addition of particles despite increases in the soluble RANKL to osteoprotegerin (OPG) ratio. Mechanical strain alone induced mature osteoclast apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, in the mature osteoclast model, the addition of nonmetal particulates protected the osteoclasts from becoming apoptopic. Titanium (Ti) and cobalt chromium (CoCr) particles, however, induced osteoclast apoptosis, whereas polyethylene (PE) and pollymethyllmethacrylate (PMMA) did not. Wear particulates and mechanical stimulation interact via an eicosanoid-dependent pathway to alter osteoclast function and survival. The addition of mechanical perturbation to a particle-laden system thus appears to enhance the potential for osteolytic activity by enhancing osteoclast survival.

40|$|Abstract—Assessment of {{surgical}} skill, {{arising from the}} synthesis of the cognitive and sensorimotor capabilities of the surgeon, has predominantly been a subjective task. Development of quantitative metrics-of-performance with clinical relevance and other desirable characteristics (repeatability and stability) has always lagged behind. New opportunities for objective and automated assessment frameworks have arisen by virtue of technological advances in computation, video-processing, and data-acquisition, especially in the robotic Minimally Invasive Surgical (rMIS) realm. Most efforts focus on semi-quantitative (Likert scale) or inadequately validated, spatially- or temporally-aggregated quantitative metrics derived from direct physical measurements. In this work we propose an automated surgical expertise evaluation method, by adapting well-established motion studies methodologies, especially for MIS evaluation. This method relies on segmenting a primary task into sub-tasks, which can be evaluated by statistical analyses of <b>micromotions.</b> Motion <b>studies</b> were developed by 2 methods: (A) manual annotation process by experts ({{to serve as a}} benchmark); and (B) automated kinematic-analysis-of-videos; for economy, repeatability as well as dexterity. The da Vinci SKILLS simulator was used to serve as a uniform testbed. Surgeons with varied levels of expertise were recruited to perform two representative simplified tasks (Peg Board and Pick & Place). The automated kinematic analysis of video was compared with the ground truth data (obtained by manual labeling) using misclassification rate and true classification confusion matrix. Future studies aimed towards analyzing real surgical procedures are already underway. I...|$|R
40|$|Hip {{resurfacing}} {{became a}} recognized entity in hip replacement in the 1970 ’s. This generation of resurfacing implants was abandoned due to loosening and debris. The interest in resurfacing was renewed {{due to the}} need of a bone conservative solution for young active patients with osteoarthritis, and a new generation metal on metal (MoM) resurfacing implants {{was introduced in the}} late 1990 ’s using the same alloy as in earlierMoM total hip replacements (THR’s). Although sharing similar resurfacing features, they could differ in aspects such as fixation method, design features and manufacturing process. Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) is the golden standard method to <b>study</b> <b>micromotion</b> in hip and knee implants; early micromotion is a strong indicator for loosening and poor long term survival. No RSA studies had been performed on earlier MoM THR´s. This meant {{that it was important to}} perform RSA studies on the new MoM resurfacing implants. In Studies I-II, RSA examinations were performed on the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing Implant (BHR), to investigate whether translation and or rotation occurred early postoperatively (Study I) and at mid term (Study II). In Study III, a two year RSA follow - up was performed on the Birmingham Mid Head Resection (BMHR) implants. The results demonstrated stable implants during the periods studied, indicating that fixation and stability should not contribute to eventual failure. One MoM resurfacing device, the Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) was recalled from clinical use in 2010 due to inferior outcome. Femoral head implant loosening and femoral neck fractures indicating instability of fixation were dominant causes at short term. The cementing technique for ASR fixation (high viscosity (HV), indirect) differed from the technique used for clinically successful resurfacing implants (low viscosity (LV), direct). Study IV was an investigation using a cadaver model, to clarify morphological differences between the HV and LV cementing techniques on ASR implants. The results demonstrated a superficial fixation with the HV technique, which in traditional hip and knee implants has been demonstrated to be favourable, but may in the ASR be insufficient to maintain adequate stable fixation. The use of the resurfacing method has declined since the ASR withdrawal, although other issues concerning the long term effects of elevated ion levels also contributed to the decline. The ASR experience underlines the importance of thorough studies of factors such as migration and wear before general market introduction of new implants...|$|R
