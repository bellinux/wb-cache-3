40|$|The {{potential}} for using readily available and cost-effective complex carbon {{sources such as}} primary sewage sludge {{for a range of}} environmental remediation processes, including biological sulphate reduction, biological nutrient removal and the bioremediation of acid mine drainage, has been constrained by the slow rate of solubilization and low yield of soluble products, which drive the above mentioned processes. Previous work conducted by the Environmental Biotechnology Group at Rhodes University indicated that the degradation of primary sewage sludge was enhanced under sulphate reducing conditions. This was proven in both laboratory and pilot-scale (Reciprocating Sludge Bed Reactor) systems, where the particulate matter accumulated in the sludge bed and the molecules in smaller flocs were rapidly solubilized. The current study was aimed at investigating in more detail the factors that govern the enhanced hydrolysis under sulphate reducing conditions, and to develop a descriptive model to explain the underlying mechanism involved. The solubilization of primary sewage sludge under sulphate reducing conditions was conducted in controlled flask studies and previously reported findings of enhanced hydrolysis were confirmed. The maximum percentage solubilization obtained in this study was 31 % and 63 % for the methanogenic and sulphidogenic systems respectively, and this was achieved over a period of 10 days. A rate of reducing sugar production and complex <b>molecule</b> <b>breakdown</b> of 51 mg. L- 1. hr- 1 and 167 mg. L- 1. hr- 1 was observed for the methanogenic and sulphidogenic systems respectively. The flask studies revealed that during hydrolysis of primary sewage sludge under sulphidogenic conditions there was enhanced production of soluble products, specifically carbohydrates (reducing sugars) and volatile fatty acids, compared to methanogenic conditions. The rate at which these products were utilized was also found to be more rapid under sulphidogenic as compared to methanogenic conditions. A study of the distribution of volatile fatty acids indicated that acetate was utilized preferentially in the methanogenic system, and that propionate, butyrate and valerate accumulated with time. The converse was found to occur in the sulphidogenic system. The descriptive model developed from {{the results of this study}} was based on the fact that a consortium of bacteria, composed of hydrolytic, acidogenic and acetogenic species, carries out the solubilization of complex carbon sources. Furthermore, it is essential that equilibrium between product formation and utilization is maintained, and that accumulation of soluble end products impacts negatively on the rate of the hydrolysis step. It is therefore proposed that the relatively poor utilization of VFA and reducing sugars in the methanogenic system activates a negative feedback inhibition on the hydrolytic and/ or acidogenic step. This inhibition is reduced in the sulphidogenic system where the utilization of end products is higher. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{development}} of nanoporous tungsten trioxide (WO 3) Schottky diode-based gas sensors. Nanoporous WO 3 films were prepared by anodic oxidation of tungsten foil in ethylene glycol mixed with ammonium fluoride and {{a small amount of}} water.

Utilizing these nanoporous structures, Schottky diode-based gas sensors were developed by depositing a platinum (Pt) catalytic contact and tested towards hydrogen gas and ethanol vapour. Analysis of the current–voltage characteristics and dynamic responses of the sensors indicated that these devices exhibited a larger voltage shift in the presence of hydrogen gas compared to ethanol vapour at an optimum operating temperature of 200 °C.

50|$|Acid Hydrolysis is the {{breakage}} {{of bonds}} by hydronium ions. Hydronium ions are {{contained within the}} liquid form of water and cause the breakage of bonds within ionic structures. When an acid is dissolved in water it separates the hydrogen ion from the other ions of the acid and the hydrogen reacts with the water molecules to form the hydronium ions causing the aforementioned hydrolysis. With {{the presence of an}} acid in this reaction this process is known as acid hydrolysis. The most commonly agent of acid hydrolysis found in historical leathers is attributed to sulfuric acid, which is absorbed from industrial pollution as sulfur dioxide. In the presence of sunlight, the sulfur dioxide is converted into sulfur trioxide and then absorbed by the tannins in the leather. The trioxide is then hydrated into sulfuric acid, dissolving in the present moisture of the leather creating the hydronium ions. It is then from these hydronium ions that internal links are broken among the leather <b>molecules.</b> <b>Breakdowns</b> include a reduction in bonds between amino acids and collagen, and additional breakdown may occur from the tannins and acids inherently present in the leather which may increase the risks and severity of acid hydrolysis. Heat, moisture and a low pH are also contributing factors in this process.|$|R

Jabor landfill, {{commonly known as}} Kuantan landfill, receives more than 500 tons of waste per day with a composition of 60 % of domestic waste and 40 % of commercial waste. The composition of domestic waste were organic waste, green waste, mixed paper, plastic, textile, ferrous, glass, rubber and leather, and others. Meanwhile, the compositions of commercial waste are food, plastic, yard waste, paper, cardboard, textile, glass, non-ferrous, rubber, wood, ferrous metals. Landfill system always produces leachate.

Screening tests with selective media demonstrated the ability of bacteria to produce amylase, lipase, protease and cellulase enzymes. These enzymes are needed to accelerate the <b>molecules</b> <b>breakdown</b> of municipal solid waste in the biodegradation process. Samples for isolation of bacteria were taken from different places, namely landfill soil and leachate. Identification of bacteria was conducted using Gen III microplate BIOLOG microbial identification system. They were Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus ruris, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus subtilis and Kocuria varians. There were 4 different treatments: composting pile without bacteria (T 0), composting pile with inoculation of amylase and protease producing bacteria (T 1), composting with inoculation of lipase and cellulase producing bacteria (T 2), and composting with inoculation all enzyme-producing bacteria (T 3). The result of biodegradation process of T 3 treatment reached the highest temperature (53 ° C) with the longest thermophilic phase compared to other treatments.

As we have {{demonstrated}} that plasma desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PD-TOFMS) is well adapted to the direct characterization of pesticides adsorbed on agricultural soils the technique has been applied {{for the first time}} to the study of their evolution under sunlight-like irradiation. Two pesticides have been selected: norflurazon which is the most documentated (both from the literature and from our previous experiments) and oxyfluorfen in order to assess the capability of the technique. The photodegradation process has been investigated both for a deposit onto a metallic substrate and for a soil impregnated with the product. For norflurazon degradation parameters have been extracted from the yield variation of ions representative of the <b>molecule</b> and <b>breakdown</b> products and particularly the time required for 50 % dissipation of their initial concentration (DT 50 values). The comparison between deposits and soils indicates clearly that the degradation is slower in the latter case with an increase of about 3. 5 for the DT 50 of the molecule, and about 2 for its breakdown products. These values are in agreement with the decays of other ions. As expected, the degradation is faster when the UV of the sunlight is unfiltered, more significantly for the breakdown products. This is also observed for the oxyfluorfen deposited onto aluminium although at a lower level (twice less). The trends are only qualitative for the impregnated soil but definitely there. A discussion is presented for the interpretation of the photodegradation process in both cases together with suggestions of improvement in the data acquisition. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

It is concluded that it had not participated in some kind of reciprocal recombination event involving the recipient chromosome.

30|$|Folate {{molecules}} {{exist in}} vivo mainly as polyglutamates {{which are the}} preferred form by most folate-dependent enzymes (Shane, 1989). Indeed, polyglutamylated 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate {{is required for the}} largest plant C 1 anabolic flux, which converts homocysteine to methionine (Hanson and Roje, 2001; Ravanel et al. 2004). In addition, the glycine–serine interconversion, which links the metabolism of one-, two- and three-carbon compounds, is another sink for the polyglutamylated folates (Bauwe and Kolukisaoglu, 2003, Besson et al. 1993). These glutamate-extended folate molecules are produced by folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS, EC 6.3. 2.17). This enzyme is responsible for sequentially conjugating L-glutamic acid residues with monoglutamate folate via γ-carboxyl peptide linkages (Suh et al., 2001). Studies of folate polyglutamylation in yeast and mammalian systems have shown that this post-biosynthetic processing protects this <b>molecule</b> from oxidative <b>breakdown</b> by protein binding (Suh et al. 2001, Jones and Nixon 2002), which is favoured by polyglutamylation resulting in folate stability. Furthermore, protein binding aids the protection of deglutamylation of polyglutamyl folates γ-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH; Wang et al. 1993). Hence, these mechanisms could retain cellular polyglutamylated folate forms for the demand of cells. In plants, the degree of glutamylation varies between organs (Lowe et al. 1993). Tetra- and pentaglutamylated folate forms are reported predominant in pea leaves (Imeson et al. 1990); whereas diglutamylated folate is predominant in carrot root (Cossins and Chen 1997).|$|R

All seven amino acids which have been tested have been incorporated. The system was sedimentable, had a high endogenous respiration, and required the continued presence of high sucrose or KCl concentrations for activity. The importance of oxidative reactions for incorporation was indicated since anaerobiosis and 2, 4 -dinitrophenol treatment inhibited incorporation.

Subjects and Methods: Gingival tissue samples were obtained from thirty patients diagnosed with chronic periodontitis. The tissue extracts were treated with Curcumin and doxycycline and inhibition of MMP- 9 analyzed by gelatinzymography. Gels obtained were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and enzymatic activities detected as bands of gelatinlysis against blue background.

40|$|Collagen cleavage, {{facilitated}} by collagenases {{of the matrix}} metalloproteinase (MMP) family, is crucial for many physiological and pathological processes such as wound healing, tissue remodeling, cancer invasion and organ morphogenesis. Earlier work has shown that mechanical force alters the cleavage rate of collagen. However, experimental results yielded conflicting data on whether applying force accelerates or slows down the degradation rate. Here we explain these discrepancies and propose a molecular mechanism by which mechanical force might change the rate of collagen cleavage. We find that a type I collagen heterotrimer is unfolded in its equilibrium state and loses its triple helical structure at the cleavage site without applied force, possibly enhancing enzymatic breakdown as each chain is exposed and can directly undergo hydrolysis. Under application of force, the naturally unfolded region refolds into a triple helical structure, potentially protecting the <b>molecule</b> against enzymatic <b>breakdown.</b> In contrast, a type I collagen homotrimer retains a triple helical structure even without applied force, making it more resistant to enzyme cleavage.

Then, characterization of the optimized NPs with respect to particle size distribution, particle morphology, drug encapsulation efficiency, MMP- 1 activity assay and in vitro release of MMP- 1 from NPs was carried out. The results of mathematical modeling show that the optimal conditions for the preparation of MMP- 1 -loaded NPs were as follows: 7 [*]min for the duration time of homogenization, 4.5 krpm for the agitation speed of homogenization and 0.4 for the volume ratio of organic solvent phase to external aqueous phase. The entrapment efficiency and the average particle size of the NPs were 38.75 [*]±[*] 4.74 % and 322.7 [*]±[*] 18.1 [*]nm, respectively. Further scanning electron microscopy image shows that the NPs have a smooth and spherical surface, with mean particle size around 300 [*]nm.

40|$|As the {{ultimate}} source of life-supporting energy, photosynthesis {{is fundamental to}} the perpetuation {{of all forms of}} life on earth. Photosynthesis involves the conversion of light energy from the sun into chemical energy stored in carbon derived <b>molecules.</b> The subsequent <b>breakdown</b> of these <b>molecules</b> provides the energy needed by the photosynthetic organism to sustain life. Non-photosynthetic organisms, in turn, receive their energy through the consumption of these photosynthetic organisms - thereby completing the cycle of life. Essential to photosynthesis is the pigment, chlorophyll, responsible for the capture and harnessing of light energy from the sun. One area of research in Dr. Antony 2 ̆ 7 s group looks at how chlorophyll pigments are made in photosynthetic cells. A 15 step biosynthetic pathway is required to makes chlorophyll. During this long process, the penultimate step is the conversion of a compound called protochlorophyllide into chlorophyllide through substrate reduction. This reduction step, which requires energy from the hydrolysis of ATP, is catalyzed by an enzyme called the Dark-Operative Protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (DPOR). In the proposed research, special interest will be devoted to the mechanism of action of DPOR. My project will address two particular questions about this mechanism: Why are two ATP molecules required for each electron transfer event, and what happens when we remove one ATP from the reaction? To answer these questions, the following specific aims are proposed: Aim 1 : Generate a heterodimeric L-protein with a single functional ATPase site {{that can be used to}} establish the precise role of each ATP molecule in electron transfer by the BchL protein. Aim 2 : Using the heterodimeric L-protein carrying mutations in one or the other ATP binding site, I will test what happens to the DPOR substrate reduction mechanism by analyzing the chemical reaction wherein protochlorophyllide is reduced to chlorophyllid...|$|R
40|$|The {{procedures}} and results of experimental and/or theoretical studies of four transient molecules, GeO, WO, BeH, and MgH {{are reported in}} the thesis. Two of them, GeO and WO, are diatomic molecules composed of relatively heavy atoms, {{and the other two}} are diatomic molecules with hydrogen as one of their component atoms. The GeO species was generated using a high temperature furnace. The rovibrational spectrum of five isotopomers were detected in emission using a Bruker IFS 120 HR Fourier transform spectrometer. Combined-isotopomer Dunham-type molecular constants have been derived for GeO using the DSParFit computer program. Analysis shows that the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is valid, as expected, for a molecule containing heavy atoms. The WO molecule was generated using a microwave discharge cell, and the spectra of electronic transitions of various systems were detected in emission using both the Bruker IFS 120 HR Fourier transform spectrometer at Waterloo and the McMath Pierce One-Meter Fourier transform spectrometer at the National Solar Observatory in Arizona. The ground electronic state has been confirmed to be X³&# 931; - based on the analysis of seven 0 - 0 bands. BeH and MgH are typical molecules with hydrogen as one of their component atoms, and the effects of Born-Oppenheimer breakdown were expected. Both of these molecules have rotational perturbations in their excited electronic states. A 'new' method of data processing was used, i. e., treating the electronic data as if they were from fluorescence series. Thus the harmful influence of the perturbed upper electronic states on the ground electronic state molecular constants is eliminated. By using the DSParFit computer program, accurate sets of combined-isotopomer Dunham-type molecular constants have been derived for the ground electronic states of the two <b>molecules,</b> and Born-Oppenheimer <b>breakdown</b> correction terms have been obtained...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} {{and control of}} nanoscale properties is a major goal in science and technology; {{for the development of}} such technologies it is important that there are experimental techniques which allow the monitoring of development processes in real time and in a range of environments. With this in mind much effort has been invested in the development of surface sensitive optical probes. One such technique, reflection anisotropy spectroscopy (RAS), has been applied successfully to a number of different problems since its development in the mid 1980 ’s. RAS as a surface specific technique is very sensitive to small changes to surface morphology, electronic structure and molecular orientation. This makes RAS a useful technique to study nanoscale changes occurring at surfaces and it is applied here to three such systems, in an attempt to develop a better understanding of both the systems and the technique. Surface defects arising from thermal processing and etching of the sample are considered and are found to {{have a significant effect on}} both the electronic structure and the morphology of the surface. The time and temperature dependences of the RAS signatures allow the monitoring of surface dynamic processes. The deposition of a monolayer of adsorbate molecules onto the surface allows a new interface to be created. Monitoring the evolution of this surface during deposition provides information about both the substrate surface and the adsorba te covered surface; a theoretical framework has been outlined to show how the sources of anisotropy from multiple thin film layers combine to give a RAS signal. Azimuth dependent RAS (ADRAS) is known to provide information on surface symmetry and can be used to determine molecular orientation. There are also a number of other angles which affect the RA spectrum from a sample. A tilted <b>molecule</b> causes a <b>breakdown</b> in surface symmetry; this work shows how such an effect can be observed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{formation}} of nisin, a 34 -residue antibacterial polypeptide, and plant-derived biomolecules and their antimicrobial properties in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) fermentations. The role of the genes nisB and nisC in the nisin biosynthetic pathway (nisA/ZBTCIPRKFEG) was investigated. Nisin was produced in M 17 G medium and in cabbage juice by fermenting with a wild-type Lactococcus lactis N 8 and the mutant strains LAC 48 and LAC 67. The fermentation types were: 1) pH not controlled, 2) adjusted at pH 5. 5, 3) recycling of L. lactis cells (pH 5. 5) (circulated batch), and 4) cabbage (sauerkraut) fermentation without pH control. Besides nisin, {{the focus was on}} the formation of plant-derived <b>molecules,</b> especially glucosinolate <b>breakdown</b> products in cabbage fermentation. The cabbage fermentations were inoculated with the following starter cultures: Lactobacillus plantarum, L. sakei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Pediococcus pentosaceus, P. dextrinicus, Lactococcus lactis N 8, and L. lactis LAC 67. Nisin was produced in different types of fermentations. The nisin titer achieved in batch fermentations in M 17 G medium was 2200 - 2500 IU ml - 1. In the case of LAC 48 the concentration remained high also after the logarithmic growth phase, whereas nisin production by the strain N 8 was more typical: the nisin titer decreased after the maximum growth. The result showed that nisin production in the case of LAC 48 was not directly related to biomass formation and was not associated with growth, which is not typical of nisin production. In order to study end-product inhibition in nisin production, a system (circulated batch) was built for nisin adsorption during fermentation. The adsorbent Amberlite XAD- 4 was found to bind nisin effectively. Cells of the strains LAC 48 and N 8 were able to compensate the removed nisin throughout fermentation, indicating that nisin production also occurs in the stationary phase. A high concentration of nisin (8000 IU ml - 1) was achieved by eluting nisin from the XAD- 4 resin. Nisin was produced in sauerkraut fermentation up to 1400 IU ml - 1 and was detectable (250 IU ml - 1) in sauerkraut even after 13 days fermentation. The role of the proteins NisB and NisC in nisin maturation has been unclear to the present day. This study showed that NisB is required for dehydration and NisC for lanthionine formation in post-translational modification of nisin. Nisin precursors from the strain lacking NisB activity were totally unmodified, whereas from the strain lacking NisC activity, but having NisB activity, were dehydrated but lacked normal lanthionine formation. This is the first reported experimental result indicating the role of NisB and NisC in correct modification of nisin. In addition to nisin, plant-derived biomolecules have been shown to possess antimicrobial properties and also to exhibit potential health effects. However, formation and/or degradation of these biomolecules in fermentation process has not been well known. In the present study, plant-derived biomolecules, glucosinolates, were decomposed during cabbage fermentation, forming beneficial breakdown products such as isothiocyanates (ITC), indole- 3 - carbinol (I 3 C) and sulforaphane. The research showed that lactic acid bacteria may affect the degradation of glucosinolates and the formation of breakdown products in cabbage fermentation. When L. sakei was used as the starter culture, the concentrations of 3 -methylsulphinylpropyl-ITC, allyl-ITC and sulforaphane were significantly higher compared with the end-products using other (single strain) starter cultures. Goitrin was found in substantially high concentrations in all end-products of starter-culture fermentation. Sulforaphane nitrile, allyl-nitrile, and goitrin were found in small quantities in the end-products of mixed-culture (L. mesenteroides + P. dextrinicus) and spontaneous fermentation. Inhibitory effects of fermented cabbage juices were observed using the indicator strains Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Candida lambica. The strongest inhibitory effects of cabbage juice were achieved by juice fermented with the strains Lactobacillus sakei and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, which also had the highest AITC concentration. Further, the juice fermented with L. sakei was capable of effectively inhibiting the growth of C. lambica and E. coli, but not of L. monocytogenes. The results indicate that concentrated nisin (8000 IU ml - 1) can be produced by using Amberlite XAD- 4 adsorbent and that bioactive glucosinolate breakdown products are formed in cabbage fermentation. A combination of these compounds may be used to extend food shelf-life, offering potential for the biopreservation of foods. In order to maximize the production of glucosinolate breakdown products potentially beneficial to health, the use of cabbage cultivars containing a high concentration of glucosinolates sinigrin, glucobrassicin, and indolyl glucosinolates is suggested. Further study is needed to optimize the cabbage fermentation process (starter culture, pH, temperature, etc.). The inhibitory effects of the combinations of nisin and glucosinolate breakdown products on food spoilage microbes should be further characterized in future research by using a wide variety of food pathogens and spoilage microbes. v 2004 okTekijältäDiss. : Helsingin yliopisto, 200...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} {{ripening}} of grape berries {{has not yet}} been clearly defined and {{a better understanding of the}} role of carotenoids and the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) may offer a useful means of manipulating berry composition and flavour profiles and the timing and synchronicity of ripening itself. ABA is an important hormone in a range of higher plant processes such as stress response, seed maturation and dormancy and fruit ripening. This thesis details the development and early biological evaluation of a library of potential ABA-like substrates as potential inhibitors of ABA biosynthesis / catabolism that are similar structurally to the backbone of ABA itself. This thesis begins with an overview of grape berry ripening and details the reasons why it may be of importance to develop substrates that can be utilised to manipulate the ripening period of grapes grown in Australia and elsewhere in the world. As ABA is a key substrate that has been extensively linked to plant development and maturation, details into numerous previous studies including the current understanding of the biosynthesis of ABA within plants are also summarised. In particular, previous studies have reported on the synthesis of ABA-like analogues and their evaluation as ABA biosynthesis inhibitors or suicide substrates to prevent catabolism which is the term given to the natural breakdown of ABA within a plant. Consequently, these studies are summarised and aided in the selection of a new library of substrates to be synthesised herein and biologically evaluated. Chapter two details the successful synthesis of eleven target ABA-like compounds with two of them existing as mixtures of related compounds. Confirmation of their structures required extensive 2 D NMR evaluation, in particular for elucidating the (E/Z) stereochemistry of the polyene backbones of the majority of these substrates. In addition, ¹³C NMR analysis was paramount and the most decisive tool for confirmation of the carbon-carbon double bond stereochemistries. Whilst the proposed biological tests only required small quantities of pure chemical material for evaluation, it was important to consider that if any of the target compounds displayed excellent biological activity, then the chemical processes for their synthesis should also be able to be scaled up to ensure ample quantities for biological / field evaluation. Pleasingly, all chemical transformations carried out herein were almost exclusively performed within the 0. 5 grams to multi-gram scale. Whilst there were a few proposed substrates that were not able to be synthesised, the reasons for which are discussed, there was one particular newly synthesised analogue (novel substituted 2, 2 -dimethyl- 6 -methylidenecyclohexylidenes (60 and 61)) that showed reasonable biological activity. There are no published reports on the use of these type of substrates being evaluated for ABA-like activity and consequently they represented a new class of substrates to be further explored along with those originally proposed. Chapter three details the use of the Lactuca (Lettuce) seed germination assay to explore the ABA-like activity of these new bioactive chemicals along with a discussion of the current understanding of the modes of ABA inhibitors and where they are likely to act in the biosynthetic pathway. ABA acts as a dormancy inhibitory hormone and in simple terms prevents germination until levels are reduced. Investigating dormancy of seeds by supplying them with ABA or ABA-like substrates (our synthesised targets) allows for the opportunity to study certain physiological relevant phenomenon that may provide information not only on the regulation of seed dormancy but also on the molecular mechanism of ABA action in plants. It was found that five of the test compounds displayed no ABA-like activity and included the simple polyene ethyl esters (30) and (31), the mixture of related esters (52) /(53) and the endoperoxides (37) and (67), Figure 3. 10. Three substrates displayed good to excellent ABA-like activity ((33), (68) and (60) /(61)) at the highest level tested of 1 mM but quickly become ineffective at the lower concentrations evaluated. Finally, three substrates displayed excellent ABA-like activity ((28), (29) and (34)) both at 1 mM and also at 100 μM, Figure 3. 10. Given that many of these new bioactive molecules are structurally similar to each other and also to the structure of ABA it was possible to elucidate some early structure-activity relationships (SAR’s). Given that the seed germination assays provided some insight into whether these compounds behave in an ABA-like manner, and indeed some appeared to, we next turned our attention to screening the compounds in a bean dehydration assay, which is the subject of this Chapter four. ABA is known to close leaf stomates and therefore reduce water loss resulting upon dehydration. Such effects were able to be seen visually and quantified based on the assay developed. Unfortunately, evaluation of all eleven new substrates revealed that none of them appeared to prevent dehydration thus it can be concluded that they do not appear to be able to act like ABA itself. However, the delay they caused in lettuce seed germination and the lack of protection of bean shoots response to an imposed dehydration event suggested that these <b>molecules</b> delayed the <b>breakdown</b> of ABA i. e. they act to decrease the rate of ABA catabolism by either blocking the 8 ’-hydroxylase enzyme or by acting as suicide substrates that are also catabolised / oxidised and deactivated in a similar manner to ABA itself by the 8 ’-hydroxylase enzyme. Importantly, a range of new ABA-like substrates have been synthesised and biologically evaluated with some of them clearly displaying reasonable activity on the ABA biosynthetic pathway in plant tissues and as such provide new lead analogues to be further studied in the future.
