50|$|<b>Milameline</b> (CI-979, PD-129,409, RU-35,926) is a non-selective muscarinic {{acetylcholine}} receptor partial agonist with cognition-acting properties {{that was being}} investigated {{for the treatment of}} Alzheimer's disease, but produced poor results in clinical trials and was subsequently discontinued.|$|E
50|$|Early in his career, Dr. Daniel pursued an {{interest}} in the developing medical specialty of Geriatric Medicine and was among the first physicians in the United States to be certified in the specialty in 1988. About that time, he also received accreditation in vascular ultrasound which he still maintains. Within geriatrics, he developed a special interest in dementia and Alzheimer's Disease and participated in the clinical trials of Cognex, the first medicine ever to be approved for the treatment of AD. He later participated in the clinical trials of Exelon and the experimental agent <b>milameline.</b> As a result of his activities, he was invited to write to textbook chapters on Alzheimer's Disease. He recorded three educational CD's on the topic of AD and geriatric medicine and wrote a paper relating to the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease. For various activities, Dr. Daniel was recognized by the Alzheimer's Association's Santa Barbara Chapter with their 2001 Leadership Award. A few days before the death of President Reagan, he also received a letter from Nancy Reagan in recognition of the chapter he wrote on Alzheimer's Disease for the 2004 edition of Conn's Current Therapy. At the time of President Reagan's death, he was interviewed on a radio station in Sacramento, CA. Beginning in 1993, Dr. Daniel has lectured widely in the United States on Alzheimer's Disease, dementia, and geriatric medicine topics.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of activation versus baseline SPECT in detecting the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients after <b>milameline</b> (CI 979 /RU 35926) treatment. Methods: Ten patients with AD who took part in a milame-line drug trial were examined by 99 mTc-hexamethylpropyl-eneamine oxime SPECT before and after the medication. A split-dose technique was used for the acquisition of baseline and activation images within a single session. Two patients were unable to complete the activation challenges. rCBF changes were assessed using the statistical parametric mapping program. Both increased and decreased contrasts were used to test rCBF changes on activation and baseline images, respectively. rCBF changes caused by activation were also examined before and after <b>milameline</b> treatment. Results: Decreased rCBFs were observed at the temporal cortex on both sides of the brain and at the left parietal cortex on the activation SPECT images after <b>milameline,</b> whereas no statistically significant rCBF change was found on the baseline SPECT images. Memory stress caused not only increased rCBF in many areas of the brain, including the parietotemporal cortex, but also decreased rCBF at the splenium of the corpus callosum. Conclusion: Cognitive activation scans are more effective than baseline scans in detecting rCBF changes in AD pa-tients after <b>milameline.</b> Key Words: regional cerebral blood flow; SPECT; statistical parametric mapping; cognitive activation; Alzheimer’s diseas...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{cholinergic}} system {{is involved in}} learning and memory and is affected in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. The possibility of non-invasively detecting alterations of neurotransmitter systems in the mouse brain would greatly improve early diagnosis and treatment strategies. The hypothesis {{of this study is}} that acute modulation of the {{cholinergic system}} might be reflected as altered functional connectivity (FC) and can be measured using pharmacological resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI). Material and methods: Pharmacological rsfMRI was performed on a 9. 4 T MRI scanner (Bruker BioSpec, Germany) using a gradient echo EPI sequence. All mice were sedated with medetomidine. C 57 BL/ 6 mice (N = 15 /group) were injected with either saline, the cholinergic antagonist scopolamine, or methyl-scopolamine, after which rsfMRI was acquired. For an additional group (N = 8), rsfMRI scans of the same mouse were acquired first at baseline, then after the administration of scopolamine and finally after the additional injection of the cholinergic agonist <b>milameline.</b> Contextual memory was evaluated with the same setup as the pharmacological rsfMRI using the passive avoidance behavior test. Results: Scopolamine induced a dose-dependent decrease of FC between brain regions involved in memory. Scopolamine-induced FC deficits could be recovered completely by <b>milameline</b> for FC between the hippocampus-thalamus, cingulate-retrosplenial, and visual-retrosplenial cortex. FC between the cingulate-rhinal, cingulate-visual and visual-rhinal cortex could not be completely recovered by <b>milameline.</b> This is consistent with the behavioral outcome, where <b>milameline</b> only partially recovered scopolamine-induced contextual memory deficits. Methyl-scopolamine administered at the same dose as scopolamine did not affect FC in the brain. Conclusion: The results of the current study are important for future studies in mouse models of neurodegenerative disorders, where pharmacological rsfMRI may possibly be used as a non-invasive read-out tool to detect alterations of neurotransmitter systems induced by pathology or treatment.

40|$|This study {{describes}} the pharmacological {{comparison of the}} muscarinic partial agonists sabcomeline, xanomeline and <b>milameline</b> at human cloned muscarinic receptor subtypes (hM 1 – 5). Radioligand binding studies at the hM 1 – 5 muscarinic receptor subtypes were compared with functional studies using microphysiometry using carbachol as the standard full agonist. In binding assays none of the compounds studied displayed preferential affinity for the M 1, 3, 4 or M 5 subtypes although carbachol was less potent at hM 1 than hM 3, 4, 5. In functional studies, all of the compounds studied displayed similar levels of efficacy across the muscarinic receptors {{with the exception of}} M 3, where there was a large apparent receptor reserve and the compounds behaved essentially as full agonists. Sabcomeline was the most potent agonist in functional studies but also showed the lowest efficacy. In terms of potency, xanomeline showed some selectivity for M 1 over M 2 receptors and <b>milameline</b> showed some selectivity for M 2 over M 1 receptors. These results show the value of microphysiometry in being able to compare receptor pharmacology across subtypes irrespective of the signal transduction pathway. None of the partial agonists showed functional selectivity for M 1 receptors, or indeed any muscarinic receptor, in the present study...|$|E
