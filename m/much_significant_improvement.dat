40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{partially}} filled poly ethylene (PE) foam core {{on the behavior}} of torsional buckling of an isotropic, simply supported piezoelectric polymeric cylindrical shell made from polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and subjected to combined electro-thermo-mechanical loads has been analyzed using energy method. The shell is reinforced by armchair double walled boron nitride nanotubes (DWBNNTs). The core is modeled as an elastic environment containing Winkler and Pasternak modules. Using representative volume element (RVE) based on micromechanical modeling, mechanical, electrical and thermal characteristics of the equivalent composite were determined. Critical buckling load is calculated using strains based on Donnell theory, the coupled electro-thermo-mechanical governing equations and principle of minimum potential energy. The results indicate that buckling strength increases substantially as harder foam cores are employed i. e. as Ec/Es is increased. The most economic in-fill foam core is at η= 0. 6, as cost increases without <b>much</b> <b>significant</b> <b>improvement</b> in torsional buckling at higher η’s...|$|E

30|$|Indian coals of drift origin (Gondwana Coal) can be {{characterized}} by high ash content with impurities disseminated in the coal bed. Very thin bands (5  mm– 3  cm) of impurities are often encountered in between coal bands. Such coal has high near gravity material (NGM >  30  %) content.

In this paper we analyze the performance of using TCP connection splitting in combination with web caches via traces obtained from a commercial satellite system. We examine the resulting performance gain under different scenarios, including the effect of caching, congestion, random loss and file sizes. We show, by analyzing our measurements, that the performance gain from using splitting is highly sensitive to random losses (for small files) and the number of simultaneous connections, and that such sensitivity is alleviated by caching. On the other hand, the use of a splitting proxy enhances the value of web caching in that cache hits result in <b>much</b> more <b>significant</b> performance <b>improvement</b> over cache misses when TCP splitting is used.

40|$|Observations of {{relative}} sea-level (RSL) change in Great Britain since 16 kyr BP and models of post-glacial isostatic adjustment provide constraints on reconstructions of the British and Antarctic ice sheets from the Last Glacial Maximum to the present. We use the global model {{from an earlier}} investigation, modified ICE- 4 G (VM 2) with lithospheric THICKNESS= 90 km, which gives good RSL fits globally {{as well as for}} much of the British data. A revised ice model for Great Britain that fits with recently published observations on ice limits and heights fails to explain all the misfits between RSL observations and predictions. <b>Much</b> more <b>significant</b> <b>improvements</b> result from models that incorporate a different chronology for the partial deglaciation of Antarctica, while keeping the total ice melt, 17 m, the same as in ICE- 4 G (VM 2). The results suggest Antarctic melting of 3 m ice equivalent sea level by 15 kyr BP, only 1 m contribution to the 24 m rise of MWP 1 a, with the major melting 12 – 5 kyr BP, and a small amount of melting, 1. 0 ± 0. 3 m, between then and 3 or 2 kyr BP. These modifications produce RSL predictions for Barbados that show the major changes in rate of sea level rise, but with an offset up to 1 kyr compared to the observations. Possible explanations that remain to be investigated further are a delay in the melting of ice from some other region, a reduction in the total melt derived from Antarctica, and a refinement of the 1 kyr temporal resolution assumed {{in the construction of the}} theoretical solution. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a multi-level cache hierarchy is decided {{by the number of}} cache levels following the inclusion or mutual exclusion property. Making all the cache levels in a hierarchy to behave either as inclusive or exclusive is not <b>much</b> beneficial. <b>Significant</b> performance <b>improvement</b> is possible if some of the cache levels are made to follow inclusion property while others not. Different cache design models are possible under this situation. This paper presents two proposed cache design models in a three level cache hierarchy. Our first proposed cache model involves making level 1 and level 2 as exclusive and level 3 as inclusive with both of them. In second proposed cache model, level 1 and level 2 are taken as inclusive and level 3 is taken as exclusive with level 2. Both the proposed cache models have been experimentally evaluated and compared on six evaluation parameters using simulator which has been implemented in PHP- 5. 3.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the trunk grouping {{effect on the}} system performance, especially in a non-uniform traffic environment. In [1], Pattavina discussed the implementation issues of output trunk grouping in a switching system, studied the throughput improvement by computer simulations, and also calculated the bounds of packet loss rate. Also, the maximum throughput analysis with output trunk grouping was recently presented in [3] under uniform traffic conditions. We here provide the exact analysis of throughput, delay and loss, based on the technique developed in [4]. Especially, {{we are able to}} evaluate the system performance in a nonuniform traffic environment where a <b>much</b> more <b>significant</b> <b>improvement</b> by trunk grouping is observed. This is because the local congestions caused by individual heavily loaded output links can now be removed upon output trunk grouping. We further propose a new concept of input trunk grouping by letting each demultiplexer have the ability to skip those input links when their buffer is full. Hence, the incoming packet will be blocked if and only if when the buffers of all input links within the same trunk group are full. In contrast, by purely time-division demultiplexing, the packet is blocked when the buffer of presently held input link is full. Considering the high non-uniformity of input link traffic intensities, such an input trunk grouping will remove any possible local congestions of individual input links within each trunk group. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 shows the system maximum throughput performance with different trunk groupings in both uniform and non-uniform traffic environments. In section 3, we evaluate the average input buffer size and packet loss rate with finite buffer size. The paper is then concluded in s [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The first essay {{examines}} Just-in-Time (JIT) manufacturing {{systems by}} incorporating the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model from operations research into a product market duopoly. We consider a two-stage {{game in which}} firms first simultaneously {{decide whether or not}} to invest in setup cost reduction and then simultaneously choose stationary production plans and sales paths. Embedded in the second stage game is the classical trade-off between setup and inventory holding costs. We obtain a tractable set of equilibria by refining subgame perfection with a forward induction argument and examine the effect of market structure on equilibrium setup cost reduction, batch sizes, and inventory levels. We show that relative to a monopoly, firms in a duopoly equilibrium may underinvest or overinvest depending on parameter values. We also show that in any duopoly equilibrium in which both firms are active, both duopolists have fewer inventories but also lower inventory turnover rates. Our results are consistent with the available empirical evidence. ^ In the second essay we examine the impact of JIT production methods on the inventory utilization and the profitability of a sample of U. S. manufacturing firms that adopted JIT in the 1980 s. We find that after the adoption of JIT methods, sample firms exhibit <b>much</b> more <b>significant</b> <b>improvements</b> in the total inventory utilization than the median firms in their industries. The most significant impact of JIT is on the utilization of the work-in-process (WIP) inventory component. After the adoption of JIT, sample firms also show short-term improvements in their profitability measures, but these improvements dissipate in later post-adoption years. We conclude that the adoption of JIT methods did not have a lasting impact on the profitability measures of sample firms. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dual-chamber {{pacemakers}} restore AV synchrony {{compared with}} ventricular pacemakers, but {{the effects on}} health-related quality of life (QOL) are uncertain. Objectives: The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the effect of pacemaker implantation, clinical factors, and pacing mode on QOL. Methods: The Mode Selection Trial (MOST) randomized 2, 010 patients with sinus node dysfunction to rate-modulated right ventricular (VVIR) or dual-chamber (DDDR) pacing. A longitudinal analysis of serial QOL measures (Short Form- 36 [SF- 36], Specific Activity Scale, and time trade-off utility) was performed. In patients who crossed over from VVIR to DDDR because of severe pacemaker syndrome, the last known QOL prior to crossover was carried forward. Results: Pacemaker implantation resulted in substantial improvement in almost all QOL measures. Subjects 75 years or older experienced significantly less improvement in functional status and physical component summary scores than did younger subjects. In longitudinal analyses of the effect of pacing mode on QOL, <b>significant</b> <b>improvement</b> in three SF- 36 subscales was observed with DDDR pacing compared with VVIR pacing: role physical [62. 8 points (95 % confidence interval [CI] 60. 2, 65. 5) vs 56. 4 (95 % CI 53. 7, 59. 1) ], role emotional [85. 0 (95 % CI 82. 9, 87. 0) vs 81. 9 (95 % CI 79. 9, 84. 0) ], and vitality [51. 8 (95 % CI 50. 3, 53. 3) vs 49. 3 (95 % CI 47. 8, 50. 7) ], but not in other SF- 36 subscales, the Specific Activity Scale, or utilities. The gains in QOL were larger than the declines associated with 1 year of aging but smaller than those associated with heart failure. Conclusion: Pacemaker implantation improved health-related QOL. The mode selected was associated with <b>much</b> smaller, but <b>significant,</b> <b>improvements</b> in several domains, particularly role physical function. © 2006 Heart Rhythm Society...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this open multicenter study of 4771 {{patients}} with a DSM-IV diagnosis of Major Depressive Episode was to analyse the response to mirtazapine in general practice and primary care. Patients with a baseline score of at least 20 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) were treated with mirtazapine for 6 weeks (30 mg/day) and clinically assessed by their psychiatrists at weekly intervals through the MADRS and Clinical Global Improvement (CGI) rating scales. The data analysis was carried out on an “intent-to-treat” basis to collect outcome information on all patients. Our results suggested that {{the efficacy of the}} antidepressant effect relates to a nonspecific process. Nearly all patients (95 %) showed at least slight improvement {{at the end of the}} observation period, while the response to treatment was independent of the clinical forms of depression. In particular, all measures of efficacy displayed the maximum change within the first 2 weeks of treatment, with further improvement occurring at <b>much</b> slower rates. <b>Significant</b> <b>improvement</b> within the first 2 weeks of treatment was highly predictive of the final response, and can serve as a guideline for clinicians when deciding about increased dosage, augmentation, or change of medication in unresponsive patients.
