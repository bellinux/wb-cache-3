5|$|The {{dropping}} {{of final}} short vowels in verb forms tended to erase mood distinctions, {{but also some}} gender distinctions; however, unexpected vowel lengthening occurred in <b>many</b> <b>situations</b> to preserve the distinctions. For example, in the suffix conjugation, first-singular *-tu {{appears to have been}} remade into *-tī already by Proto-Hebrew on the basis of possessive -ī (likewise first singular personal pronoun *ʔana became *ʔanī).|$|E
5|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{established}} its Yucca Mountain {{standards in}} June 2001. The storage standard set a dose limit of 15 millirem {{per year for}} the public outside the Yucca Mountain site. The disposal standards consisted of three components: an individual dose standard, a standard evaluating the impacts of human intrusion into the repository, and a groundwater protection standard. The individual-protection and human intrusion standards {{set a limit of}} 15 millirem per year to a reasonably maximally exposed individual, who would be among the most highly exposed members of the public. The groundwater protection standard is consistent with EPA's Safe Drinking Water Act standards, which the Agency applies in <b>many</b> <b>situations</b> as a pollution prevention measure. The disposal standards were to apply for a period of 10,000 years after the facility is closed. Dose assessments were to continue beyond 10,000 years and be placed in DOE's Environmental Impact Statement, but were not subject to a compliance standard. The 10,000 year period for compliance assessment is consistent with EPA's generally applicable standards developed under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. It also reflects international guidance regarding the level of confidence that can be placed in numerical projections over very long periods of time.|$|E

25|$|Umlaut or {{mutation}} is an assimilatory process {{acting on}} vowels preceding a vowel or semivowel {{of a different}} vowel backness. In the case of i-umlaut and ʀ-umlaut, this entails a fronting of back vowels, with retention of lip rounding. In the case of u-umlaut, this entails labialization of unrounded vowels. Umlaut is phonemic and in <b>many</b> <b>situations</b> grammatically significant as {{a side effect of}} losing the Proto-Germanic morphological suffixes whose vowels created the umlaut allophones.|$|E
