5000|$|The {{highest point}} of the trail, which {{is close to the}} county top of Middlesex, is just above the Grim's Dyke Golf Club which can be passed using the 'Bushey Heath Walk' footpath. The walk {{eventually}} extends through a small wood with a BT <b>microwave</b> <b>aerial</b> prominent. Close to the aerial's enclosure is a Stone Marker created by the Harrow Heritage Trust that reads: 'This ancient earthwork once stretched through Harrow for some six miles from Cuckoo Hill, Pinner to Pear Wood, Stanmore, but now only parts remain. Named after Grim (another name for the English King of the gods (also the god of death), Woden).' ...|$|E
50|$|The {{tower was}} {{commissioned}} by the General Post Office (GPO). Its primary purpose was to support the <b>microwave</b> <b>aerials</b> then used to carry telecommunications traffic from London {{to the rest of}} the country, as part of Britain's microwave network.|$|R
50|$|The {{tower was}} {{designed}} by {{the architects of the}} Ministry of Public Building and Works: the chief architects were Eric Bedford and G. R. Yeats. Typical for its time, the building is concrete clad in glass. The narrow cylindrical shape was chosen because of the requirements of the communications aerials: the building will shift no more than 25 cm in wind speeds of up to 150 km/h (95 mph). Initially the first 16 floors were for technical equipment and power. Above that was a 35-metre section for the <b>microwave</b> <b>aerials,</b> and above that were six floors of suites, kitchens, technical equipment and finally a cantilevered steel lattice tower. To prevent heat build-up the glass cladding was of a special tint. The construction cost was £2.5 million.|$|R
40|$|The aim is {{to create}} the new methods for design and {{construction}} of the small-size dipole aerials, mainly, on base of the symmetric dipoles. It has been proved that the integral equation of the impedance dipole is the second-order Fredholm equation in the Hilbert space and has only the single generalized solution. The asymptotic behaviour of the solution decomposition coefficient according to the basis has been studied. The numerical-analytical method for solution of the integral equation has been constructed, and the efficiency of this method for solution of the concrete problem has been investigated. The high-effective algorithms and programs for complex electrodynamic analysis of the small-size impedance dipole aerials with distributed impedance and concentrated load operating steadly at change of the input dipole parameters and load parameters have been developed on base of the numerical-analytical method.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was performed at sea where the effectiveness of dispersants applied from a helicopter was tested on fresh and weathered crude oils released from a surface research vessel. In conjunction with these experiments, remote sensing measurements using an array of airborne optical and microwave sensors were performed in order {{to aid in the}} interpretation of the dispersant effectiveness and to obtain quantitative images of oil on the sea under controlled conditions. Surface oil thickness and volume are inferred from airborne measurements using a dual-channel <b>microwave</b> imaging radiometer, <b>aerial</b> color photography, and an airborne oceanographic lidar. The remotely sensed measurements are compared with point sampled data obtained using a research vessel. The mass balance computations of surface versus subsurface oil volume using remotely sensed and point sampled data are consistent {{with each other and with}} the volumes of oil released. Data collected by the several techniques concur in indicating that, for the oils used and under the sea conditions encountered, the dispersant and application method are primarily useful when applied to fresh oil...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of Folgefonna, three large maritime ice masses in Hardanger, Western Norway has been assessed {{over the last}} 150 years {{using a variety of}} remote sensing datasets (optical and <b>microwave</b> satellite images, <b>aerial</b> photography, digital elevation models (DEMs) and old maps). Changes in glacier area, volume and elevation of the transient snowline (TSL), a commonly used glacier mass balance proxy are determined. All three parameters show a similar trend, although the scarcity of glacier volume data points means that changes cannot be resolved in as much detail as the measurements of glacier area or the TSL elevation. Since the Little Ice Age (LIA) maxima {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century Folgefonna has been retreating and losing mass with noticeable glacier advances in the 1960 s/ 70 s and the 1990 s. Since the turn of the millennium Folgefonna has retreated rapidly interrupted only by a short lived advance between 2005 and 2008. In 2011 Nordfonna, Midtfonna and Sørfonna had respective areas of 24. 8 km², 9. 1 km² and 156. 7 km², reductions of 47 %, 68 % and 20 % compared with their LIA maxima sizes in 1860. The TSL mirrors this trend albeit with less magnitude compared with the other observations, it is therefore assumed that in actual fact it the firn line being measured and not the TSL. Absolute ice volume calculations are only possible for Nordfonna where the subglacial topography is known; Nordfonna measured 1. 84 km³ in 2010, a reduction of 43 % of its 1937 volume. If planar bedrock surfaces beneath 95 % of the ice surfaces are assumed then rudimentary percentage losses can be calculated. Over the same time span Midtfonna lost 1441 million kg (50 %) of mass, while Sørfonna lost 8268 million kg (18 %) between 1987 and 2010, the portion of Sørfonna visible on the 1937 topographic map lost 5658 million kg (21 %) between then and 2010. The changes observed remotely in Folgefonna relate well to the in-situ data as well as the climatic data, it is evident that winter precipitation has traditionally been the principle driver of Folgefonna, however recent increases in summer temperature have been responsible for the acceleration in glacier shrinkage. Folgefonna is found to have advanced and retreated roughly in synchronisation with ice masses in Scandinavia, Europe and further afield suggesting that a global force is partly responsible for driving the glacier...|$|R
