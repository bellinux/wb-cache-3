5|$|Despite Mitică's {{association}} with Bucharest and his usual most common {{career as a}} state employee, several commentators have recounted {{that he may have}} been based on Gheorghe Matheescu, an entrepreneur from the town of Sinaia (located on the Prahova Valley, in northern <b>Muntenia).</b> Matheescu took pride in this supposed connection, and, around 1939, argued in its favor in front of literary historian Şerban Cioculescu. Cioculescu recorded the rumor, and indicated that it was backed by information received from Caragiale's daughter, Ecaterina Logadi. Her father reportedly enjoyed Matheescu's company, and, in 1901, even authored short advertisements for his store.|$|E
5|$|Latin {{documents}} {{used the}} term Wallachia or Wallachia maior (‘Greater Wallachia’) for <b>Muntenia</b> (which first appeared in 1373), and Wallachia minor (‘Lesser Wallachia’) for Oltenia (first recorded in 1377). The new country was identified as terra transalpina (‘land beyond the mountains’) or partes transalpinae (‘parts beyond the mountains’) in documents issued by the Royal Chancellery of Hungary in the entire 14th century. The terminology of the Hungarian chancellery was also used in the Latin documents of the Wallachian voivodes.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{consolidation}} of Wallachia, waves of nomadic peoples – the last of them being the Cumans and the Mongols – rode across the territory. The territory became a frontier area between the Golden Horde (the westernmost part of the Mongol Empire) and the Kingdom of Hungary after 1242. The Romanians in <b>Muntenia,</b> east of the Olt River, had {{to pay tribute to}} the Mongols; and west of the river, in Oltenia, they were oppressed by the Bans of Severin, appointed by the Kings of Hungary. The Golden Horde's domination decreased in the region {{at the end of the}} 13th century, and at that time the Kingdom of Hungary also underwent a strong political crisis. These events enabled the incipient states of the territory to consolidate their autonomy.|$|E
5|$|Heliade inaugurated {{his series}} of {{proposals}} for reforming {{the language in}} 1828, when his work on Romanian grammar called for the Cyrillic script to be reduced to 27 letters, reflecting phonetic spelling (for this rule, Heliade cited {{the example of the}} Latin alphabet as used in Ancient Rome). Soon after, he began a campaign in favor of introducing Romance neologisms, which he wanted to adapt to Romanian spelling. By that time, Romanians in various regions had grown aware of the need to unify the varieties of Romanian and create a standard Romanian lexis: this notion was first supported by the Transylvanians Gheorghe Şincai and Petru Maior, whose proposal was to unite Romanians around the issue of the choice of liturgical language, both Orthodox and Greek-Catholic (see Transylvanian School). Heliade, who first proposed a language regulator (an idea which was to be employed in creating the Romanian Academy), expanded on this legacy, while stressing that the dialect spoken in <b>Muntenia,</b> which had formed the basis of religious texts published by the 16th century printer Coresi, serve as the standard language.|$|E
5|$|Romanian chronicles {{written in}} the 17th century narrate that a herțeg or duke of Făgăraș and Almaș, named Radu Negru (‘Radu the Black’) or Negru Vodă (‘The Black Voivode’) was the first voivode of Wallachia. These texts state that Radu Negru, {{together}} with some colonists ("Romanians, Catholics and Saxons") arrived from the region of Făgăraş in Transylvania. The first documentary evidence for a terra Blacorum (‘land of the Vlachs’) on the territory later called Făgăraș is an early 13th-century property register which mentions the order of King Andrew II of Hungary that estates previously in Vlach hands {{be transferred to the}} Cistercian abbey at Cârța. Radu Negru and his followers crossed the Carpathians to <b>Muntenia</b> and founded Wallachia with its capitals in Câmpulung and Curtea de Argeș. The chronicles narrate these events under the year 1290 or 1292.|$|E
25|$|With {{an area of}} {{approximately}} , Wallachia is situated north of the Danube (and of present-day Bulgaria), east of Serbia {{and south of the}} Southern Carpathians, and is traditionally divided between <b>Muntenia</b> in the east (as the political center, <b>Muntenia</b> is often understood as being synonymous with Wallachia), and Oltenia (a former banat) in the west. The division line between the two is the Olt River.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary historians {{estimate}} {{the population of}} Wallachia in the 15th century at 500,000 people. In 1859, the population of Wallachia was 2,400,921 (1,586,596 in <b>Muntenia</b> and 814,325 in Oltenia).|$|E
25|$|The type {{site of the}} Boian {{culture is}} located on an island on Lake Boian {{in the region of}} <b>Muntenia,</b> on the Wallachian Plain north of the Danube River.|$|E
25|$|Bucharest is {{the seat}} of the Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church, one of the Eastern Orthodox churches in communion with the Patriarch of Constantinople, and also of its subdivisions, the Metropolis of <b>Muntenia</b> and Dobrudja and the Archbishopric of Bucharest. Orthodox believers {{consider}} Demetrius Basarabov to be the patron saint of the city.|$|E
25|$|The patriarchal {{chair is}} {{currently}} held by Daniel I, Archbishop of Bucharest, Metropolitan of <b>Muntenia</b> and Dobrudja (former Ungro-Wallachia) and Patriarch of All of the Romanian Orthodox Church. Since 1776, the Metropolitan of Ungro-Wallachia has been titular bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia (Locțiitor al tronului Cezareei Capadociei), an honor bestowed by Ecumenical Patriarch Sophronius II.|$|E
25|$|The {{unification}} of small polities ruled by local Romanian leaders in Oltenia and <b>Muntenia</b> {{led to the}} establishment of a new principality, Wallachia. It achieved independence under Basarab the Founder, who defeated a Hungarian army in the battle of Posada in 1330. A second principality, Moldavia, became independent in the 1360s under Bogdan I, a Romanian nobleman from Maramureș.|$|E
25|$|The Old Princely Court (Curtea Veche) {{was erected}} by Mircea Ciobanul in the mid-16th century. Under {{subsequent}} rulers, Bucharest was established {{as the summer}} residence of the royal court. During the years to come, it competed with Târgoviște {{on the status of}} capital city after an increase in the importance of southern <b>Muntenia</b> brought about by the demands of the suzerain power – the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
25|$|Căciulă joasă – {{cylindrical}} fur {{cap with}} the top larger than the base. This is called mocănească, rotată, retezată or turtită and is worn by shepherds {{on both sides of}} the southern Carpathians (in Mărginimea Sibiului, Oltenia, <b>Muntenia</b> and Vrancea) and also in Bărăgan Plain and Dobruja due to this area being used for summer pastures by the Carpathian shepherds, and also in Maramureș.|$|E
25|$|The fotă is a richly-ornamented {{wrap-around}} skirt {{made out}} of a rectangular piece of woolen fabric worn at the waist. Alternately, {{it can be made}} of two pieces of woven material that cover the front of the body (like an apron) and the back. The fotă has several names, according to the ethnographic region: pestelcă (in <b>Muntenia),</b> opreg, vălnic and zăvelcă (in Oltenia), catrință or cretință (in Moldavia), păstură and zadie (in Transylvania), peștiman (in Bessarabia).|$|E
25|$|He came to {{associate}} with Odobescu, and was appointed by the latter official illustrator of the magazines printed by the Romanian Commission of Historical Monuments. Trenk traveled throughout the regions of <b>Muntenia</b> and Oltenia, creating {{a large number of}} oil paintings featuring rural scenes, historical relics, and natural scenes—including several depictions of the Olt River near the Cozia Monastery. For a while, he taught drawing at a Bucharest gymnasium, and had the major Romanian painter Ion Andreescu among his students.|$|E
25|$|Roman sources {{list the}} Dacia as an {{imperial}} province on August 11, 106. It was governed by an imperial legate of consular standing, supported by two legati legionis {{who were in}} charge of each of the two legions stationed in Dacia. The procurator Augusti was responsible for managing the taxation of the province and expenditure by the military. The territory conquered by Trajan was portioned between the newly formed province and the existing provinces bordering imperial Dacia. Moesia Inferior absorbed what eventually became South Moldavia, <b>Muntenia,</b> and Eastern Oltenia, while Dacia Traiana was composed of the western portions of Oltenia, Transylvania, and the Banat.|$|E
25|$|After {{the region}} of Transylvania, {{formerly}} in Austria-Hungary, was united with Romania, Sadoveanu established contacts with its feminist scene. By 1920, she {{was elected to the}} Steering Committee of the Transylvanian-based Romanian Women's Union (UFR), assisting its President Maria Baiulescu as one of the UFR's three Vice Presidents for <b>Muntenia</b> (alongside Micaela Catargi and Eugenia de Reuss Ianculescu). She later traced the origin of Romania's organized feminist movement with the UFR's earliest nucleus, created in the 1840s by Maria Nicolau. Her interest in Transylvania also surfaced in her work as a teacher: in the summer months of 1919, she was in Cluj, instructing locals on the practical use of the Montessori method. Her work as a journalist diversified, and she was, before 1924, one of the regular writers in Lamura, a literary review published by Vlahuță.|$|E
25|$|By 118, Hadrian {{himself had}} taken to the field against the Roxolani and the Iazyges, and {{although}} he defeated them, he agreed to reinstate the subsidies to the Roxolani. Hadrian then decided to abandon certain portions of Trajan's Dacian conquests. The territories annexed to Moesia Inferior (Southern Moldavia, the south-eastern edge of the Carpathian Mountains and the plains of <b>Muntenia</b> and Oltenia) were returned to the Roxolani. As a result, Moesia Inferior reverted once again to the original boundaries it possessed prior to the acquisition of Dacia. The portions of Moesia Inferior {{to the north of}} the Danube were split off and refashioned into a new province called Dacia Inferior. Trajan's original province of Dacia was relabelled Dacia Superior. It was at this time that Hadrian moved the Legio IV Flavia Felix from its base at Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa, and ordered it stationed in Moesia Superior.|$|E
25|$|The fotă {{is made of}} woollen {{material}} or cotton mixed with wool, woven on four heddles. It fully covers the underskirt (poale) except for, in some areas, the hem. The oldest fote were made of black or greyish brown fabric using the natural colours of the wool. The earliest decoration was a red border (bete roșii) at the lower edge and on the front edge, which strengthen the fabric. This type of fotă is still found in north Moldavia where fote made of hemp or flax were formerly worn in some parts in summer. Fote with vertical stripes (vâstre) are also common in this area. The extent of the decoration becomes more elaborate as one moves south. The stripes change from simple woven decoration to alternately simple stripes and stripes of woven motifs (alesăture). In <b>Muntenia,</b> the stripes are replaced by compact woven decoration or heavy geometric embroidery, covering the whole surface except for the area which is overlapped in the front. The richest decoration is found in Argeș and Muscel zones where the fotă itself is occasionally made from silk, and the woven decoration is in gold or silver thread.|$|E
25|$|Hard {{felt hats}} {{are made by}} {{specialised}} craftsmen in workshops and are worn throughout the year. These hats are found centred on the Saxon regions around Sibiu and Bistrița {{and may have been}} introduced into Transylvania by the Saxons, whose craftsmen made them in workshops, from the 18th century. The style varies widely in shape and size of brim according to area. The wide brimmed hat appeared around the 17th-19th centuries and felt hats with broad brims up to 60cm were worn in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and continued to be worn in Bistrița Valley, Moldavia until the 1940s. Hats with 40cm brims were worn in central Transylvania and <b>Muntenia.</b> Felt hats with hard upturned brims – cu găng – were worn in Crișana, Hunedoara and Bukovina following a fashion of the gentry. Wide brimmed felt hats with a large peacock feather (roată de păun) are still worn in Năsăud, further south the hats are much reduced in size, shepherds in Sibiu and along the southern Carpathians wear felt hats with very small brims, the present day fashion tending {{to do away with the}} brim altogether.|$|E
500|$|Mitică (...) is {{a fictional}} {{character}} who appears in several sketch stories by Romanian writer Ion Luca Caragiale. The character's {{name is a}} common hypocoristic form of Dumitru or Dimitrie (Romanian for Demetrius). He {{is one of the}} best-known figures in Caragiale's 1901 collection Momente şi schiţe, as well as in Romanian humor at large. Mitică is a male resident of Bucharest whose background and status are not always clear, generally seen as an allegory of the average Bucharester or through extension, inhabitants of Romania's southern regions—Wallachia and <b>Muntenia.</b> According to accounts, he was based on a resident of Sinaia, whom Caragiale had befriended.|$|E
500|$|After the Mongol invasion, a {{great many}} (if not most) of the Cuman {{population}} left the Wallachian Plain, but the Vlach (Romanian) population remained there {{under the leadership of}} their local chiefs, called knezes and voivodes. In 1247, King Béla IV tried to bring the Knights Hospitallers to the region and granted to them a number of territories in the [...] "land of Severin". The knights’ mission, however, proved to be a total failure (there is even no report whether they occupied their posts), but the royal charter for the knights, dated June 2, 1247, lists four autonomous territorial-administrative units (kenezates) in Oltenia and western <b>Muntenia.</b>|$|E
500|$|Two of them, the kenezates of Johannes and Farcaş {{were given}} to the Knights Hospitallers. But the kenezates under Litovoi and Seneslau were {{exempted}} from the grant, and the royal charter expressly stipulated that they were to be left [...] "to the Vlachs as they had owned it until now". On the other hand, the royal charter also describes that Voivode Litovoi's rule had extended on the northern side of the Transylvanian Alps into the Hunedoara region, but the king removed this territory from Litovoi's authority in 1247; thenceforward Litovoi's kenezate was restricted to the Oltenian part of the Jiu valley. Voivode Seneslau held the territories of central and southern <b>Muntenia</b> {{on the banks of the}} rivers Argeș and Dâmbovița.|$|E

2500|$|Wallachia or Walachia ( [...] archaic: , Romanian Cyrillic alphabet: [...] ) is a {{historical}} and geographical region of Romania. It is situated north of the Lower Danube {{and south of the}} Southern Carpathians. Wallachia is traditionally divided into two sections, <b>Muntenia</b> (Greater Wallachia) and Oltenia (Lesser Wallachia). Wallachia as a whole is sometimes referred to as <b>Muntenia</b> through identification with the larger of the two traditional sections.|$|E
2500|$|The Hungarian form Erdély {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in the 12th-century Gesta Hungarorum as Erdeuleu (in modern script Erdőelü) or Erdő-elve. The word Erdő means forest in Hungarian, and the word Elve denotes a region in connection with this, similarly to the Hungarian name for <b>Muntenia</b> (Havas-elve, or land lying ahead of the snow-capped mountains). [...] Erdel, Erdil, Erdelistan, the Turkish equivalents, or the Romanian Ardeal were borrowed from this form as well.|$|E
2500|$|High conical cap – căciulă țuguiată, moțată – this {{is made of}} four pieces joined {{together}} lengthwise. It can be worn peaked, with top bent forward, back or sideways, or with top sunk inwards, depending on local fashion. It is worn in Moldavia, <b>Muntenia,</b> Oltenia and Banat, originally by the [...] "free men". In Banat Mountains, the cap is sometimes worn with fur inside and a narrow white fur hem at base.|$|E
2500|$|In Romania, Merlot is {{the most}} widely {{exported}} red wine grape variety with [...] in cultivation in 2008. Most of these plantings are found along the Black Sea in Dobruja, further inland in the <b>Muntenia</b> region of Dealu Mare and in the western Romanian wine region of Drăgășani. Here the grape is often made a varietal but is sometimes blended with other international varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon and with local grape varieties such as Fetească neagră.|$|E
2500|$|In the Early Middle Ages, in Slavonic texts, {{the name}} [...] ( [...] or [...] "Hungaro-Wallachian Land") {{was also used}} as a {{designation}} for its location. The term, translated in Romanian as [...] "Ungrovalahia", remained in use up to the modern era in a religious context, referring to the Romanian Orthodox Metropolitan seat of Hungaro-Wallachia, in contrast to Thessalian or Great Vlachia in Greece or Small Wallachia (Mala Vlaška) in Serbia. Official designations of the state were <b>Muntenia</b> (The Land of Mountains) and Țara Românească (Terra Romana, or The Romanian Land).|$|E
2500|$|He {{founded the}} PȚ in the Romanian Old Kingdom in 1918; under his leadership, it emerged from {{northern}} <b>Muntenia</b> {{and became a}} grouping with national appeal. The PȚ had much success in the elections of November 1919, forming a coalition government with the Transylvanian Romanian National Party (PNR), under Alexandru Vaida-Voevod. As a politician, Mihalache made himself known for supporting a political option that mixed traditionalist reserve towards industrialization and calls for preserving the rural base of Romanian economy through voluntary cooperative farming (allowing for a peasant-based industry) with a vision of left-wing Corporatism. In 1929, he wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|These clashes {{overlapped}} with a [...] "great famine", {{so severe}} that it reportedly pushed Wallachians to sell their children into Ottoman slavery. Moreover, they resulted in the annexation of Brăila, a lucrative Wallachian port, to the Ottoman Empire. Described in some records as an éminence grise, Coadă {{may have played a}} [...] "decisive role" [...] in this affair, thanking the Ottomans for their support against Șerban's party. [...] Paisie {{was one of the last}} Wallachian rulers to maintain a capital at Târgoviște, though he also resided in Bucharest. The slow transition signaled a shift in Ottoman priorities, from northern <b>Muntenia,</b> with its Transylvanian commitments, to a new city closer to the Ottoman garrison at Yergöğü (Giurgiu).|$|E
2500|$|According to archaeological findings, {{the cradle}} of the Dacian culture is {{considered}} to be north of the Danube towards the Carpathian mountains, in the historical Romanian province of <b>Muntenia.</b> It is identified as an evolution of the Iron Age Basarabi culture. The earlier Iron Age Basarabi evidence in the northern lower Danube area connects to the iron-using Ferigile-Birsesti group. This is an archaeological manifestation of the historical Getae who, along with the Agathyrsae, are {{one of a number of}} tribal formations recorded by Herodotus. In archaeology, [...] "free Dacians" [...] are attested by the Puchov culture (in which there are Celtic elements) and Lipiţa culture to the east of the Carpathians. The Lipiţa culture has a Dacian/North Thracian origin. [...] This North Thracian population was dominated by strong Celtic influences, or had simply absorbed Celtic ethnic components. Lipiţa culture has been linked to the Dacian tribe of Costoboci.|$|E
2500|$|Little {{is known}} about Radu Paisie's origins and early life, {{although}} it is often assumed that he was baptized as [...] "Petru" [...] and had a strong connection with Argeș County, in <b>Muntenia.</b> According to some reports, {{he was married to}} a Lady Stana. It is also known that he had a sister, Cârstina. One account is that he was born into boyardom, and that, following his wife's death, he had taken orders at Argeș Monastery. Scholar Valentin Gheonea proposes that Petru was forced into monastic seclusion by Prince Vlad Vintilă de la Slatina, after an early attempt to seize the throne. Written tradition maintains that, while at Argeș, he was known as Hegumen Paisie. A document issued by Michael the Brave implies that Paisie was also a fishmonger, calling him Radu vodă Măjescul—"Radu Voivode of the Maja", from an obsolete measure of weight for fish.|$|E
2500|$|At Luptătorul newspaper, {{he resumed}} earlier {{discussions about the}} [...] "parasitical" [...] nature of {{literary}} criticism. These claims were soon completed by sarcastic notes on the inflation of novels and novelists in Western countries, and their relative scarcity in Romania. Vinea argued that Romanian literature could develop without the novel: [...] "its absence isn't necessarily a reason to feel melancholy." [...] He envisaged a literature of the lampoon, the prose poem, the reportage, and the greguería. His columns on Dada moved from half-hearted support, visibly annoyed by Tzara's [...] "buffoonery", to chronicling of the movement's [...] "ephemeral" [...] nature and inevitable demise. Ignored by Tzara, Vinea began reciprocating: he claimed that Dada was not Tzara's making, but had deeper Romanian roots in the avant-garde stories of a (still obscure) suicidal clerk, Urmuz, and {{in the work of}} sculptor Constantin Brâncuși. He depicted the primitivist streak of high modernism as a more authentic current than traditionalism, in particular Transylvanian traditionalism, and saw <b>Muntenia</b> as the cradle of authentic urban culture. This led to publicized polemics with Alexandru Hodoș, the nationalist columnist at Țara Noastră, but also with Benjamin Fondane, the more cautious Moldavian modernist.|$|E
2500|$|During the interwar {{period of}} Greater Romania the {{government}} imposed successive bans on the group's operations. The {{first came in}} 1926: the group was considered a deviation from mainstream Christianity and an extra headache for authorities busy dealing with new extremist movements. At that point, The Watchtower was banned, part of a wider move to curtail the group's publications. By the early 1930s, pressure had eased and the headquarters moved to Bucharest, {{as part of a}} shift into eastern and southern Romania. Orthodox Ukrainians and Serbs were converted, followed by Romanian Seventh-day Adventists in Moldavia and inroads into Dobruja, Oltenia and <b>Muntenia.</b> The group was legalised again in 1933; its application to register as a joint-stock company claimed 2000 members at the time. The following ban came in 1937, as the rule of King Carol II was sliding into authoritarianism. In the piece of legislation passed to this effect by the Gheorghe Tătărescu cabinet, they were defined as one of the [...] "religious associations and sects" [...] whose activity on Romanian soil was prohibited; the list also included the Pentecostals, the Apostolic Faith Church of God, the Nazarenes, the Old Calendar Orthodox, the Inochentist church and Bible societies.|$|E
2500|$|With the Iazyges and the Carpi, the Taifals were harassing the Roman {{province}} of Dacia {{in the mid}} fourth century. However, {{the arrival of a}} new threatHunsfrom Central Asia changed the political layout of Dacia: [...] "the Huns threw themselves upon the Alans, the Alans upon the Goths, and the Goths upon the Taifali and Sarmatae." [...] Athanaric had refused to extend his defensive preparations to the Taifalian territory and the Huns forced the Taifals to abandon Oltenia and western <b>Muntenia</b> by 370. The Taifals allied with the Greuthungi of Farnobius against Rome; they crossed the Danube in 377, but were defeated in late autumn that year. The Taifals were prominent among the survivors of Farnobius' coalition. After the Gothic victory at Adrianople (378) under Fritigern, the Thervingian king Athanaric began to assail the Taifals. Athanaric had not included the Taifals in his defensive construction efforts against the Huns earlier (376). The breaking of the alliance between Thervingia and Taifal may {{have had something to do}} with disagreements over tactics in light of the Huns and the crossing of the Danube, the Taifals being horsemen and the Thervingi infantry.|$|E
