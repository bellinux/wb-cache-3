Furthermore, A.viridimontanum can grow in both shade and sun, while A.pedatum grows in shade only.|$|E
5|$|The E3 Harelbeke {{takes place}} on roads in Flanders, {{starting}} and ending {{in the town of}} Harelbeke.

Carletonomys was probably herbivorous and lived in a wet habitat.|$|E
5|$|Betances is {{considered}} a pioneer of Puerto Rican liberalism. His ideas resulted from his exposure to republicanism and social activism in France through the <b>middle</b> <b>part</b> of the 19th. century. These ideas, considered subversive in the severely restricted Puerto Rico of the era, had nevertheless a considerable impact in the island nation's political and social history. His ideas on race relations alone had {{a major impact on}} economics and the social makeup of the island.|$|E

5|$|Goldman {{was well}} known during her life, {{described}} as—among other things—"the most dangerous woman in America". After her death and through the <b>middle</b> <b>part</b> of the 20th century, her fame faded.

5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is {{relatively}} long and line-shaped. The central groove in the nasal depression {{is relatively}} narrow.

The <b>middle</b> <b>part</b> of the palate is concave, not flat as in M.aelleni and M.manavi. At the palate's back margin is a long, thin posterior palatal spine.|$|E

5|$|Thunderstorms {{began to}} form again just before midday, as the {{hot and humid}} {{conditions}} became more acute in the <b>middle</b> <b>part</b> of the day.

5|$|A {{cold front}} moved eastward through the United States in the <b>middle</b> <b>part</b> of July, {{and reached the}} East Coast of the United States on July23. By the {{following}} day, a low pressure area developed just southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina ahead of the frontal zone, and quickly formed into a subtropical depression. In association with a nearby upper-level low, the depression tracked quickly southeastward before turning to the southwest. The subtropical depression gradually organized, and satellite classifications began subsequent to merging with a tropical wave on July25. Convection developed closer {{to the center of}} circulation as it gradually decelerated while continuing southwestward and on July27, the system organized into Tropical Depression Three while located about 335miles (539.1km) east of Daytona Beach, Florida.|$|E

5|$|Diplodocus had an {{extremely}} long tail, composed of about 80 caudal vertebrae, which are {{almost double the}} number some of the earlier sauropods had in their tails (such as Shunosaurus with 43), and far more than contemporaneous macronarians had (such as Camarasaurus with 53). Some speculation exists {{as to whether it}} may have had a defensive or noisemaking (by cracking it like a coachwhip) function. The tail may have served as a counterbalance for the neck. The <b>middle</b> <b>part</b> of the tail had 'double beams' (oddly shaped chevron bones on the underside, which gave Diplodocus its name). They may have provided support for the vertebrae, or perhaps prevented the blood vessels from being crushed if the animal's heavy tail pressed against the ground. These 'double beams' are also seen in some related dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Geologically the East Riding {{district}} is split into three parts. The western {{part is the}} eastern section of the Vale of York with the southern extension into the Humberhead Levels. In this area there is a belt of sandstones overlain by glacial and lake deposits formed {{at the close of}} the last ice age. The <b>middle</b> <b>part</b> is the Yorkshire Wolds, a chalk formation which extends from the Humber at North Ferriby to the coast at Flamborough Head, a chalk headland. The south-east of the {{district is}} the low-lying coastal plain of Holderness, which faces east to the North Sea, and to the south drains into the Humber estuary. South of Flamborough Head is Bridlington, which features several beaches, and at the far south-east of the district is the Spurn peninsula.|$|E
5|$|In {{a losing}} Queensland team, Hunt played neither well nor badly, being {{outstanding}} in defence but subdued in attack. As a result, Hunt's position at five-eighth was in {{question for the}} second game, but coach Mal Meninga stated that Hunt would remain in the team. Hunt was named on the interchange bench for the second game, making way for Queensland custodian and captain Lockyer in the five-eighth role. However, Meninga made a late change before the game, starting Hunt at fullback and moving Slater to the interchange bench. Hunt played in the match, which Queensland won 30–0, for only 51 minutes, being put on the interchange bench for 29 minutes in the <b>middle</b> <b>part</b> of the game. He retained his starting position for game three, which Queensland won to take the series.|$|E
