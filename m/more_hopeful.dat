25|$|Despite being a {{short-lived}} band, Zwan {{is credited with}} being {{a bridge between the}} success of the Smashing Pumpkins in the 1990s and the further career developments and experimentations undertaken by Corgan in the 2000s, as well as his shift from his sombre, dark themes towards <b>more</b> <b>hopeful</b> lyrics in line with his spiritual development at the time.|$|E
25|$|The general {{prognosis}} for PNP is poor. It is <b>more</b> <b>hopeful</b> if the tumor is benign, {{but in the}} case of malignant tumors, the mortality rate is roughly 90%. The two most commonly associated types of tumors are non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic lymphoma; nearly all of these patients die within two years of diagnosis. This is attributed to the effects of the tumor combined with the negative side effects of the medication administered to treat PNP.|$|E
25|$|Finally, Dawkins {{searches}} {{for an explanation}} of morality based upon evolutionary biology, which he considers <b>more</b> <b>hopeful</b> than ancient texts. Together with the evolutionary psychologist , he discusses the primordial morality to be found among chimpanzees. Curry explains his view that we don't need religion to explain morality and if anything it simply gets in the way. Instead, he claims, a more convincing explanation {{is to be found}} in the concepts of reciprocal altruism and kin selection.|$|E

50|$|As time passes, Mr. Frank also learns of the {{corruption}} within the Underground Railroad itself, discovering that the abolitionists {{he works with}} are nothing <b>more</b> than <b>hopeful</b> slaveowners, convincing slaves from the South {{to run away from}} their original masters with promises of freedom, only to be enslaved once more.|$|R
25|$|The {{following}} year saw the provincial Liberals come {{very close to}} extinction. The party's political credibility had been steadily eroding, and with the negotiations with Social Credit, it was not immediately clear that it had any ideological purpose. There was much discussion of the party abandoning provincial politics altogether (there was only one organization at federal and provincial levels), and concentrating on federal politics, which looked a great deal <b>more</b> <b>hopeful</b> at the time than they did two years later.|$|E
25|$|Fox {{approved}} Battle for the Planet of the Apes with a $1.2 million budget, {{the lowest}} of the series. The filmmakers went into the project knowing {{it would be the}} last of the series. J. Lee Thompson returned as director. Series writer Paul Dehn submitted a treatment, but illness forced him to leave the film before completing the script. The producers subsequently hired John William Corrington and Joyce Hooper Corrington to write the screenplay. Battle continued Conquests focus on racial conflict and domination. However, likely based in part on the studio's wishes, the Corringtons discarded Dehn's pessimistic treatment in favor of a story with a <b>more</b> <b>hopeful,</b> though ambiguous, resolution.|$|E
25|$|He {{followed}} his success by developing into his Rose period from 1904 to 1907, which introduced a strong element of sensuality and sexuality into his work. The Rose period depictions of acrobats, circus performers and theatrical characters are rendered in warmer, brighter colors and are far <b>more</b> <b>hopeful</b> and joyful in their {{depictions of the}} bohemian life in the Parisian avant-garde and its environs. The Rose period produced two important large masterpieces: Family of Saltimbanques (1905), which recalls the work of Gustave Courbet (1819–1877) and Édouard Manet (1832–1883); and Boy Leading a Horse (1905–06), which recalls Cézanne's Bather (1885–87) and El Greco's Saint Martin and the Beggar (1597–1599). While he already had a considerable following {{by the middle of}} 1906, Picasso enjoyed further success with his paintings of massive oversized nude women, monumental sculptural figures that recalled the work of Paul Gauguin and showed his interest in primitive (African, Micronesian, Native American) art. He began exhibiting his work in the galleries of Berthe Weill (1865–1951) and Ambroise Vollard (1866–1939), quickly gaining a growing reputation and a following amongst the artistic communities of Montmartre and Montparnasse.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{debates in}} radical {{geography}} seem {{determined to be}} oppositional {{and in so doing}} simplify what is at stake. We need to celebrate and maintain the openness of geography to multiple perspectives while simultaneously developing <b>more</b> action-oriented, <b>hopeful</b> ways forward. Anarchist perspectives hold plenty of promise for radical geography, but only if we critically interrogate their principles and empirics...|$|R
5000|$|Spring {{carries a}} new {{sound from the}} {{previous}} two Foreman EPs, Fall and Winter, which were more melancholy in nature. [...] "Spring" [...] is rooted in <b>more</b> upbeat, <b>hopeful</b> tones.

500|$|Simone's {{consciousness}} on {{the racial}} and social discourse {{was prompted by}} her friendship with black playwright Lorraine Hansberry, the influence of Hansberry planted the seed for the provocative social commentary that became an expectation in Simone's repertoire. One of Nina's <b>more</b> <b>hopeful</b> activism anthems, [...] "To Be Young, Gifted and Black" [...] was written with collaborator Weldon Irvine {{in the years following}} the playwrights passing, acquiring the title of one of Hansberry's unpublished plays.|$|E
500|$|Wilson was <b>more</b> <b>hopeful,</b> whereas Gran shared Scott's concern. Shortly afterwards, {{the death}} toll among the ponies {{increased}} to six, three drowning when sea-ice unexpectedly disintegrated, casting in doubt the possibility of reaching the pole at all. However, during the 1911 winter Scott's confidence increased; on 2 August, after the return of a three-man party from their winter journey to Cape Crozier, Scott wrote, [...] "I feel sure we are as near perfection as experience can direct".|$|E
500|$|Following the {{spectacular}} {{success of the}} first Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, Oklahoma! (1943), the pair sought to collaborate on another piece, knowing that any resulting work would be compared with Oklahoma!, most likely unfavorably. [...] They were initially reluctant to seek the rights to Liliom; Molnár had refused permission for the work to be adapted in the past, and the original ending was considered too depressing for the musical theatre. [...] After acquiring the rights, the team created a work with lengthy sequences of music and made the ending <b>more</b> <b>hopeful.</b>|$|E

500|$|In November 2013, Obama's {{administration}} opened {{negotiations with}} Iran {{to prevent it}} from acquiring nuclear weapons, which included an interim agreement. Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced July 14, 2015. The deal, titled the [...] "Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action", saw the removal of sanctions in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons. While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a <b>more</b> <b>hopeful</b> world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.|$|E
500|$|The Cathedral Porch {{stands in}} ruins and prisoners {{who have been}} {{released}} are quickly replaced by other unfortunate souls. The puppet-master, Don Benjamin, {{has been reduced to}} madness because of the environment of terror he has been made to endure. Readers are given one more glimpse of the maddening state of life under a dictatorship. The epilogue concludes with a <b>more</b> <b>hopeful</b> tone, which is seen through a [...] "mother's voice telling her rosary" [...] which concludes with the Kyrie eleison; the call for the [...] "Lord to have Mercy".|$|E
500|$|Erik Adams of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B+" [...] and felt that, {{as the show}} lost viewers in the first season, the stories got better, and that [...] "Diversity Day" [...] is an {{excellent}} example of this [...] "unfortunate trend". He noted that the episode [...] "would go on {{to be one of the}} series’ defining episodes, an installment that put a <b>more</b> <b>hopeful</b> spin on the original Offices views on accepting the disparity between our dreams and our realities." [...] However, Adams noted that Carell's character was still too aggressive for Michael Scott to be completely lovable, and that the second season episode [...] "Sexual Harassment" [...] would serve as [...] "a gentler spiritual sequel" [...] to this episode, featuring a similar premise, but with a softened Michael Scott. For his work on this episode, B. J. Novak was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Screenplay – Episodic Comedy.|$|E

At forty-six he was more spontaneous and enthusiastic than George, and far <b>more</b> happy and <b>hopeful.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar came to {{my office}} the other day to recount his country's {{remarkable}} transformation. He described a nation {{of people who are}} harder-working, more virtuous – yes, more virtuous, because the market punishes immorality – and <b>more</b> <b>hopeful</b> about the future than they've ever been in their history.

By 1879, Bodie had a population of approximately 5,000–7,000 people and around 2,000 buildings.

This marked the first time since 1934 that the party in control of the White House gained seats in a midterm election in both houses of Congress (previous occasions were in 1902 and following the Civil War). Bush was renominated without opposition as the Republican candidate in the 2004 election and titled his political platform [...] "A Safer World and a <b>More</b> <b>Hopeful</b> America".|$|E
50|$|Vale {{were moved}} to the Third Division North in 1952-53, and Steele kept the playing squad as it was, deeming the players he {{inherited}} to {{have the potential to}} achieve promotion. Despite Ivor Powell coming back to haunt the club by leading Bradford City to victory on the opening day of the season, Vale showed their class by losing just seven of their remaining 41 games. Steele dropped himself as a player in December 1952 to focus on management, building up a strong side based around a formidable defence, mainly using local players, also favouring more experienced players over <b>more</b> youthful <b>hopefuls.</b> However they finished in second-place, one point behind Oldham Athletic, and so were not promoted.|$|R
5000|$|Pope Leo X died on Sunday, 1 December 1521, {{at the age}} of 46. The Conclave {{to elect}} his {{successor}} should have begun in mid-December, but the Cardinals themselves fixed an opening date of 18 December. When it was learned, however, that the Cardinal of Ivrea, Bonifacio Ferrero, had been detained by Spanish troops at Pavia, the decision was taken to postpone the opening of the Conclave until 26 December. This gave all the participants plenty of time for pratticà (politicking). On Sunday the 22nd, the usual morning Congregation of the Cardinals took place at the house of the Dean of the College of Cardinals, Bernardino de Carvajal, but later in the day, a private meeting was held at the house of Cardinal Colonna, at which fourteen cardinals and representatives of four other cardinals participated. Their object was to stop the election of Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, who was the favorite candidate of the Spanish. Among the dissenters were Cardinal Agostino Trivulzio and Cardinal Scaramuccia Trivulzio ("Como"), both members of the French faction. [...] The large number of candidates (papabili) also worked against Medici by dividing the vote among a dozen or <b>more</b> <b>hopefuls.</b> Medici controlled around fifteen votes, {{and he was able to}} block any objectionable candidate by denying him the canonically required two-thirds of the votes; but he realized that he himself was not electable. It was not until 9 January 1522, after the tenth ballot had taken place, that a successful election was achieved, once it was revealed that the Emperor Charles V favored his Regent in Spain, Cardinal Adrian Dedel, Bishop of Tortosa.|$|R

2500|$|Some {{commentators}} {{criticized the}} quick and complete forgiveness {{with which the}} Amish responded, arguing that forgiveness is inappropriate when no remorse has been expressed, and that such an attitude {{runs the risk of}} denying the existence of evil, while others were supportive. Donald Kraybill and two other scholars of Amish life noted that [...] "letting go of grudges" [...] is a deeply rooted value in Amish culture, which remembers forgiving martyrs including Dirk Willems and Jesus himself. They explained that the Amish willingness to forgo vengeance does not undo the tragedy or pardon the wrong, but rather constitutes a first step toward a future that is <b>more</b> <b>hopeful.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The band {{formed as}} a four-piece {{in the summer of}} 1981 and {{featured}} Alec MacKaye, former vocalist for the Untouchables, on vocals, Michael Hampton and Ivor Hanson of Henry Rollins' first band, State of Alert on guitar and drums respectively, as well as Chris Bald on bass. They called themselves 'The Faith' and played their first show at H.B. Woodlawn High School in November '81. Alec described the name as [...] "a positive kind of sound, not negative like so many others." [...] "We felt that (The) Faith [...] was a stronger-than-macho name. We did want something <b>more</b> <b>hopeful</b> and less nihilistic, in spite of our chaotic and sometimes destructive approach to performance." ...|$|E

Ian Hockley of Beyond the Pale website described the [...] "return to basics with few overdubs and often just a voice and piano base" [...] where the first disc [...] "deals with John Howard’s re-election and the bleak feelings that event engendered" [...] and the second one [...] "is <b>more</b> <b>hopeful</b> and life-affirming with bigger, more elaborate productions." [...] Several tracks received considerable airplay, including [...] "I Was Alive". Three of the songs on the album have been released as radio-only singles, with a fourth, [...] "Beautiful as You", released as a CD single.|$|E

Verne reportedly cut some especially negative lines out of the script, and protested when d'Ennery had them reinserted for the production. Journey Through the Impossible would be their last collaboration. The play is also Verne's only contribution to the féerie genre.|$|R

In a further interview, AnNa R. compared Herz (2004), the band's previous studio album, with Das große Leben, declaring that the former was more upbeat, whereas the latter was <b>more</b> melancholic, but <b>hopeful.</b> Plate added that the idea behind the album's title (which literally means [...] "The great life") was to indicate the enormity of each life.|$|R
