5|$|Toothache is {{the most}} common type of {{orofacial}} pain and, when severe, it is considered a dental emergency, since there may be a significant impact on sleep, eating, and other daily activities. It is one of the most common reasons for emergency dental appointments. Correct diagnosis can sometimes be challenging. The treatment of a toothache depends upon the exact cause, and may involve a filling, root canal treatment, extraction, drainage of pus, or other remedial action. The relief of toothache is considered one of the main responsibilities of dentists. In 2013, 223 <b>million</b> <b>cases</b> of tooth pain occurred as a result of dental caries in permanent teeth and 53 <b>million</b> <b>cases</b> occurred in baby teeth. Historically, the demand for treatment of toothache is thought to have led to the emergence of dental surgery as the first specialty of medicine.|$|E

The average life expectancy of people with the disorder is ten to twenty-five years less than for the general population.

40|$|Background: A Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis was {{launched}} in 2000, with mass drug administration (MDA) as the core strategy of the programme. After completing 13 years of operations through 2012 and with MDA in place in 55 of 73 endemic countries, {{the impact of the}} MDA programme on microfilaraemia, hydrocele and lymphedema is in need of being assessed. Methodology/Principal findings: During 2000 – 2012, the MDA programme made remarkable achievements – a total of 6. 37 billion treatments were offered and an estimated 4. 45 billion treatments were consumed by the population living in endemic areas. Using a model based on empirical observations of the effects of treatment on clinical manifestations, it is estimated that 96. 71 <b>million</b> LF <b>cases,</b> including 79. 20 million microfilaria carriers, 18. 73 <b>million</b> hydrocele <b>cases</b> and a minimum of 5. 49 <b>million</b> lymphedema <b>cases</b> have been prevented or cured during this period. Consequently, the global prevalence of LF is calculated to have fallen by 59 %, from 3. 55 % to 1. 47 %. The fall was highest for microfilaraemia prevalence (68 %), followed by 49 % in hydrocele prevalence and 25 % in lymphedema prevalence. It is estimated that, currently, i. e. after 13 years of the MDA programme, there are still an estimated 67. 88 <b>million</b> LF <b>cases</b> that include 36. 45 million microfilaria carriers, 19. 43 <b>million</b> hydrocele <b>cases</b> and 16. 68 <b>million</b> lymphedema <b>cases.</b> Conclusions/Significance: The MDA programme has resulted in significant reduction of the LF burden.

5|$|In {{addition}} to death occurring in pregnancy and childbirth, pregnancy {{can result in}} many non-fatal health problems including obstetrical fistulae, ectopic pregnancy, preterm labor, gestational diabetes, hyperemesis gravidarum, hypertensive states including preeclampsia, and anemia. Globally, complications of pregnancy vastly outway maternal deaths, with an estimated 9.5 <b>million</b> <b>cases</b> of pregnancy-related illness and 1.4 million near-misses (survival from severe life-threatening complications). Complications of pregnancy may be physical, mental, economic and social. It is estimated that 10–20 million women will develop physical or mental disability every year, resulting from complications of pregnancy or inadequate care. Consequently, international agencies have developed standards for obstetric care.|$|E

Paresthesia was the predominant symptom in less serious cases. Worse cases included ataxia (typically loss of balance), blindness or reduced vision, and death resulting from central nervous system failure. Anywhere between 20 and 40mg of mercury has been suggested as sufficient for paresthesia (between 0.5 and 0.8mg/kg of body weight). On average, individuals affected consumed 20kg or so of bread; the 73,000 tonnes provided would have been sufficient for over 3 <b>million</b> <b>cases.</b>|$|E
5|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the secondest common {{cancer in the world}} and the commonest amongst women, as well as being amongst the ten commonest chronic {{diseases}} of women, and a substantial contributor to loss of quality of life (Gronowski and Schindler, Table IV). Globally, it accounts for 25% of all cancers. In 2016, breast {{cancer is the}} commonest cancer diagnosed amongst women in both developed and developing countries, accounting for nearly 30% of all cases, and worldwide accounts for one and a half <b>million</b> <b>cases</b> and over half a million deaths, being the fifth commonest cause of cancer death overall and the second in developed regions. Geographic variation in incidence is the opposite of that of cervical cancer, being highest in Northern America and lowest in Eastern and Middle Africa, but mortality rates are relatively constant, resulting in a wide variance in case mortality, ranging from 25% in developed regions to 37% in developing regions, and with 62% of deaths occurring in developing countries.|$|E

In the Northern and Southern parts of the world, outbreaks occur mainly in winter while in areas around the equator outbreaks may occur at any time of the year. Death occurs mostly in the young, the old and those with other health problems. Larger outbreaks known as pandemics are less frequent. In the 20th century, three influenza pandemics occurred: Spanish influenza in 1918 (~50 million deaths), Asian influenza in 1957 (two million deaths), and Hong Kong influenza in 1968 (one million deaths). The World Health Organization declared an outbreak of a new type of influenza A/H1N1 to be a pandemic in June 2009. Influenza may also affect other animals, including pigs, horses and birds.|$|E

More than 450,000 of these fatalities are due to rotavirus in children under 5years of age. Cholera causes about three to five <b>million</b> <b>cases</b> of disease and kills approximately 100,000 people yearly. In the developing world, children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year that result in significant gastroenteritis.
