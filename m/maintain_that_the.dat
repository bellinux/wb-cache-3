25|$|Viktor Zemskov–Zemskov <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{population}} loss {{due to the}} war was 20 million, including 16 million {{direct losses}} and 4 million deaths due to the deterioration in living conditions. He <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Russian Academy of Science figure of 26.6 million total war dead includes about 7 million deaths due to natural causes based on <b>the</b> mortality rate <b>that</b> prevailed before <b>the</b> war. Zemskov <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> military dead numbered 11.5 million, including nearly 4 million POWs. He <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> figure of 6.8 million civilian deaths in occupied regions was overstated because it included persons who were evacuated to the rear areas. He submitted an estimate of 4.5 million civilians who were Nazi victims or {{were killed in the}} occupied zone. Zemskov <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government figure of 2.1 million civilian deaths due to forced labor in Germany was inflated compared to German wartime records <b>that</b> put <b>the</b> deaths of forced workers at 200,000.|$|R

5|$|Approximately sixteen {{lists of}} censured theses were {{issued by the}} University of Paris during the 13th and 14th centuries. Most of these lists of propositions were put {{together}} into systematic collections of prohibited articles. Of these, the Condemnations of 1277 are considered particularly important by those historians who consider {{that they had a}} side effect of encouraging scholars to question the tenets of Aristotelian science. From this perspective, some revisionist historians <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> condemnations had positive effects on the development of science, perhaps even representing the beginnings of modern science.|$|E
5|$|In their Bounty histories, both Hough and Alexander <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{men were}} not at a stage close to mutiny, however sorry they were to leave Tahiti. The journal of James Morrison, the boatswain's mate, {{supports}} this. The events that followed, Hough suggests, were determined in the three weeks following the departure, when Bligh's anger and intolerance reached paranoid proportions. Christian was a particular target, always seeming to {{bear the brunt of}} the captain's rages. Unaware of the effects of his behaviour on his officers and crew, Bligh would forget these displays instantly and attempt to resume normal conversation.|$|E
5|$|When {{a pattern}} is called digital, this most often {{means that it}} is visibly {{composed}} of computer-generated pixels. The term is sometimes also used of computer generated patterns like the non-pixellated Multicam and the Italian fractal Vegetato pattern. Neither pixellation nor digitization contribute to the camouflaging effect. The pixellated style, however, simplifies design and eases printing on fabric, compared to traditional patterns. While digital patterns are becoming widespread, critics <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pixellated look {{is a question of}} fashion rather than function.|$|E

5|$|Dualism and monism {{are the two}} central {{schools of}} thought on the mind–body problem, {{although}} nuanced views have arisen that do not fit {{one or the other}} category neatly. Dualism is seen even in the Eastern tradition, in the Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, and Plato, but its entry into Western philosophy was thanks to René Descartes in the 17th century. Substance dualists like Descartes argue that the mind is an independently existing substance, whereas property dualists <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mind is a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but {{that it is not a}} distinct substance.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that the atrocities that Las Casas described were exaggerated or even invented, {{but this is not}} generally considered likely as Las Casas was far from the only person to be deeply worried about abuse and mistreatment of the Indians. The Dominican friars Antonio de Montesinos and Pedro de Córdoba had reported extensive violence already {{in the first decade of}} the conquest of the Indies, and throughout the conquest of the Americas there were reports of abuse of the natives by friars and priests and ordinary citizens, and many massacres of indigenous people were reported in full by those who perpetrated them. Even some of Las Casas's enemies, such as Toribio de Benavente Motolinia, reported many gruesome atrocities committed against the Indians by the colonizers. All in all, modern historians tend to disregard the numerical figures given by Las Casas, but <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> general picture he presented of an intensely violent and abusive conquest did represent reality.|$|E
5|$|Odaenathus was {{described}} as Roman senator in the undated tomb inscription and Hairan I was mentioned with the same title in the 251 inscription. Scholarly opinions vary on the exact date of Odaenathus' elevation to the position; Gawlikowski and Jean Starcky <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> senatorial rank predates the Ras elevation. Udo Hartmann concludes that Odaenathus first became a Ras in the 240s then a senator in 250. Another possibility is that the senatorial rank and lordship occurred simultaneously; Odaenathus was chosen as a Ras following Gordian's death, then after Philip the Arab concluded a peace with the Persians, the emperor ratified Odaenathus' lordship and admitted him to the senate to guarantee Palmyra's continuous subordination.|$|E

5|$|Gurovich, Guillermo Rougier, and colleagues, on {{the other}} hand, <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dentary is referable to Ferugliotherium and that the p4s of Argentodites and MACN Pv-RN 975 are very similar. The {{alveolus}} of MACN Pv-RN 975 fits the lower incisors attributed to Ferugliotherium in size and the blade-like premolar is of the size expected for an animal with molariforms the size of Ferugliotherium teeth. If the dentary and premolars (whose identification has been similarly controversial; see below) {{do not belong to}} Ferugliotherium, then, Gurovich and Beck argue, the Los Alamitos Formation would contain two mammals (Ferugliotherium and a multituberculate) similar in size and morphology, and therefore presumably occupying similar ecological niches—and one of those would be represented only by molariforms and incisors and the other only by premolars and a jaw fragment among the available fossils. Furthermore, they noted that the transition from blade-like to molariform premolars had actually been observed in the fossil record of the extinct sthenurine kangaroos, and that the first molariform in Sudamerica and Gondwanatherium is laterally compressed, suggesting that it may have derived from a blade-like tooth. Gurovich and Beck attributed the difference in shape between the MACN Pv-RN 975 and Argentodites p4s to the extensive wear of the former, and suggested that the two are similar enough that they probably represent at least closely related species.|$|E
5|$|Monism is the {{position}} that mind and body are not ontologically distinct entities (independent substances). This view was first advocated in Western philosophy by Parmenides in the 5th century BC and was later espoused by the 17th century rationalist Baruch Spinoza. Physicalists argue that only entities postulated by physical theory exist, and that mental processes will eventually be {{explained in terms of}} these entities as physical theory continues to evolve. Physicalists maintain various positions on the prospects of reducing mental properties to physical properties (many of whom adopt compatible forms of property dualism), and the ontological status of such mental properties remains unclear. Idealists <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mind is all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself, or an illusion created by the mind. Neutral monists such as Ernst Mach and William James argue that events in the world {{can be thought of as}} either mental (psychological) or physical depending on the network of relationships into which they enter, and dual-aspect monists such as Spinoza adhere to {{the position}} that there is some other, neutral substance, and that both matter and mind are properties of this unknown substance. The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include behaviorism, the type identity theory, anomalous monism and functionalism.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the local}} {{political}} discussion has been about building a stadium, beginning in the 1990s when a Maryland location was chosen for what is now FedExField. With the possibility of building a new stadium in the near future, both the previous and current mayors of the District of Columbia have stated that a name change {{must be part of}} the discussion, however the team rejects that possibiltiy. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe has met with the owner to discuss the building of a new stadium in Virginia. For many years, beginning with the departure of the Baltimore Colts, the Redskins were the only NFL team in a large area from Maryland into the southern states. This is slowly changing as Maryland NFL fans move to the Baltimore Ravens. Several Maryland politicians have stated that the name should change, but the current governor opposes any change, also citing the desire to keep the stadium in Maryland. Virginia fans are now the more numerous and dedicated supporters of the Redskins, and the state and local governments have used economic incentives to encourage the team's relocation of its facilities there, and <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> name is entirely a business decision for the team to make. An agency of the commonwealth, the Virginia Lottery, is a sponsor of the team, and says it has never had any complaints.|$|E

5|$|On February 11, 1813, Alejandro Ramírez {{arrived to}} Puerto Rico and almost {{immediately}} {{was named to the}} office of Intendant, eventually establishing a Consulate of Commerce to control trade in Puerto Rico. Originally from Guatemala, where he had served in various political positions, Ramírez was {{also a member of the}} Philadelphia Philosophical Society. The Diario Económico de Puerto Rico, a newspaper specialized in the archipelago's economy, noted that during the time banknotes of all denominations were still being forged in large quantities. The publication claimed that the counterfeits were most likely produced in other locations of the Caribbean, this was based on the fact that only one royal press existed in Puerto Rico. However, modern researchers <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> copies could have been produced locally in a clandestine manner. This is based on a report that emphasizes that the designs of false 8-real notes were crude and that the ink used spread when touched, something that wouldn't be possible if produced elsewhere, particularly because the ink would dry in the voyage between countries. During this time, paper notes began disappearing and the stated recurred to renewing old pieces.|$|E
5|$|Out of options, Buchner opened negotiations, {{using those}} interned {{in the castle}} as hostages. Presenting them at the keep's door, he made clear {{that they would be}} killed unless Ferdinand promised to spare his, his wife's and Sudermann's lives. Ferdinand acceded to Buchner's demand; some sources <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Abbot of Heisterbach, one of the prisoners, had been treated decently by Buchner {{throughout}} his imprisonment in the castle and himself asked for Buchner's life to be spared. The prisoners were released. With much difficulty, given the state of mind of the besiegers, Ferdinand and Arenberg brought the Buchners and Sudermann out of the castle alive. Once the Buchners, Sudermann, and the hostages were clear of the fortress, Ferdinand released his troops, who were in an ugly mood and hungry for blood and plunder. All those who remained in the keep—soldiers, men, women and children—were killed, some inside the keep, some in the courtyard below; the slaughter lasted well into the night. The castle's 178 dead were buried in two mass graves whose locations remain unknown. Among those who perished in the destruction and storming of the castle {{was also one of the}} prisoners, a vicar from Hildesheim. The Hildesheim suffragan, too, was not among the rescued prisoners; he had died during his incarceration, a short while before the castle was stormed.|$|E
5|$|There is also {{a debate}} in the {{linguistic}} literature whether Greenlandic has noun incorporation. This is because Greenlandic does not allow the kind of incorporation common in many languages in which a noun root {{can be incorporated into}} almost any verb to form a verb with a new meaning. On the other hand, Greenlandic does often form verbs that include noun roots. The question then becomes whether to analyse these verb formations as incorporation or as denominal derivation of verbs. Greenlandic has a number of morphemes that require a noun root as their host and which form complex predicates that correspond closely in meaning to what is often seen in languages that have canonical noun incorporation. Linguists who propose that Greenlandic does have incorporation argue that these morphemes are in fact verbal roots that must obligatorily incorporate nouns to form grammatical clauses. This argument is supported by {{the fact that many of}} the derivational morphemes that form denominal verbs work almost identically to canonical noun incorporation. They allow the formation of words with a semantic content corresponding to an entire English clause with verb, subject and object. Another argument is that the morphemes used to derive denominal verbs come from historical noun incorporating constructions that have become fossilized. Other linguists <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> morphemes in question are simply derivational morphemes that allow the formation of denominal verbs. This argument is supported by the fact that the morphemes cannot occur without being latched on to a nominal element. The examples below illustrate how Greenlandic forms complex predicates including nominal roots.|$|E
