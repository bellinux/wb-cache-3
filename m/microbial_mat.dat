5|$|Chemical {{reactions}} led to {{the first}} self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago. A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all life arose. The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (O3) in the upper atmosphere. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted {{in the development of}} complex cells called eukaryotes. True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface. Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is <b>microbial</b> <b>mat</b> fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia, biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland, remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.|$|E

The <b>microbial</b> <b>mats</b> were formed by iron bacteria, such as Toxothrix trichogenes and Leptothrix ocheracea. The <b>microbial</b> <b>mats</b> were more remarkable in areas mainly containing clays than sandstone areas. The <b>microbial</b> <b>mats</b> were seen in the aquatic environment where the oxidation-reduction potential (Eh) was in the range of + 165 to + 244 mV and the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) was in the range of 2. 7 to 7. 4 mg/L. In addition, more <b>microbial</b> <b>mats</b> were formed around the part in the range of about 0 to 15 meters from the aperture mouth of drainpipes, while less <b>microbial</b> <b>mats</b> were formed in the deep part of drainpipes.

25|$|Early {{molluscs}} {{appear to}} have grazed on microbial mats, so it is natural to hypothesize that grazing molluscs were also restricted to areas where the mats could survive. The earliest known fossils of monoplacophoran ("single-plated") molluscs date from the Early Cambrian, where they grazed on microbial mats. Most modern monoplacophorans live on soft subtrates in deep parts of the seas, although one genus lives on hard substrates {{at the edges of}} continental shelves. Modern monoplacophorans have less diverse shell forms than fossil genera. Unfortunately the oldest known fossils of polyplacophorans (molluscs with multiple shell plates) are from the Late Cambrian, when the substrate revolution had significantly changed marine environments. Since they are found with stromatolites (stubby pillars built by some types of <b>microbial</b> <b>mat</b> colony), it is thought that polyplacophorans grazed on microbial mats. Modern polyplacophorans mainly graze on mats on rocky coastlines, although a few live in the deep sea. No fossils have been found of aplacophorans (shell-less molluscs), which are generally regarded as the most primitive living molluscs. Some burrow into the sea-floors of deep waters, feeding on micro-organisms and detritus; others live on reefs and eat coral polyps.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePurpose: Marine {{mangrove}} sediments in the Manche-à-Eau lagoon (Guadeloupe, Caribbean Sea) harbor locally extensive, white <b>microbial</b> <b>mats.</b> These mats {{cover the}} surface of reduced sediments near the roots of red mangrove trees, Rhizophora mangle, and {{are mainly composed of}} sulfur-oxidizing bacteria belonging to the Beggiatoaceae family, with some filamentous cyanobacteria. The goal {{of this study was to}} investigatethe possible influence of sediment characteristics on the presence of these <b>microbial</b> <b>mats.</b> Materials and methods: Four push cores were collected in April 2013, two from zones with <b>microbial</b> <b>mats</b> and two from zones without mats. Sediment characteristics (grain-size distribution, mineralogy, total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) contents, atomic TOC/TN ratios, and organic matter (OM) δ 13 C values) were compared for all four cores. Results and discussion: Significant differences were observed between sediments below <b>microbial</b> <b>mats</b> and those without <b>mats.</b> Sediments with <b>microbial</b> <b>mats</b> contained greater amounts of clay, and higher TOC, TN, and TOC/TN ratios, with lower total carbonate content andδ 13 C values. The higher clay content most likely results from lower fluid flow velocity near to mangrove roots, while higher TOC/TN ratiosand lower δ 13 C values indicate higher inputs of OM from mangrove trees. These results are consistent with the fact that <b>microbial</b> <b>mats</b> were observed near the roots of mangrove trees, which trap OM from terrestrial vegetation and fine sediments. Conclusions: The grain-size distribution of sediment particles, the total carbonate content, and the δ 13 C values are the main parameters discriminating between zones with <b>microbial</b> <b>mats</b> and those without mats. Variations in total carbonate content, which is mainly of biogenic origin, result from conditions that are more favorable for benthic organisms in zones without <b>microbial</b> <b>mats.</b> Variations of the TOC/TN ratios are controlled by the presence of a non-negligible amount of inorganic nitrogen bound to surface clay mineral particles and/or by microbial processes...|$|R

40|$|Marine {{sedimentary}} habitats {{generally have}} their highest microbial {{activity in the}} top few centimeters. Where light reaches the surface sediments, benthic oxygenic photoautotrophs composed of cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae (such as diatoms) dominate. In situations with a low grazing pressure like intertidal flats, this leads to permanently vertically laminated microbial communities (photosynthetic <b>microbial</b> <b>mats).</b> Although the importance of collecting samples at the scale relevant for microbial activity in sedimentary habitats has been acknowledged, this aspect is still virtually unstudied. The main focus in this thesis concerns, therefore, microscale (μm to mm) spatial distributions of key players in photosynthetic <b>microbial</b> <b>mats,</b> i. e. viruses, prokaryotes and oxygenic photoautotrophs. Initially, two methods were developed; to extract and count viruses from <b>microbial</b> <b>mats,</b> and to discriminate in a non-intrusive manner the different photoautotrophic groups. Application showed strong vertical and horizontal microscale heterogeneity in the distributions of these microbes, both in intertidal sediment (Scotland) and photosynthetic <b>microbial</b> <b>mats</b> (Netherlands).

High viral abundances in the <b>microbial</b> <b>mats</b> indicated that viruses could be a significant structuring factor. Fungi clearly affected the spatial distribution of oxygenic photoautotrophs by degrading benthic cyanobacteria and diatoms in ring-like shapes during summer and autumn. Based on these findings I recommend more research on microscale distributions and underlying mortality processes to improve our understanding of species diversity, succession and biogeochemical cycling in <b>microbial</b> <b>mats...</b>|$|R
