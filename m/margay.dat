5|$|Fauna is {{similarly}} distributed, with distinct altitudinal zonation present. The highest altitudes support the endangered mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque), cougar (Puma concolor), guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), and Andean fox (Lycalopex culpaeus). Lower down, the spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), jaguar (Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), <b>margay</b> (Leopardus wiedii), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), brocket deers (Mazama sp.), vulnerable northern pud√∫ (Pudu mephistophiles), and endangered giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) {{can all be}} found. Bird species common in the area include the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), Andean cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola peruvianus), giant hummingbird (Patagona gigas), torrent duck (Merganetta armata), king vulture (Sarcoramphus papa), and swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus).|$|E
5|$|The {{diploid number}} of {{chromosomes}} in the cheetah is 38, {{the same as}} in most other felids (though for the ocelot and the <b>margay</b> the number is 36). A remarkable feature of the cheetah is its unusually low genetic variability in comparison to other felids. Consequently, individuals show considerable genetic similarity to one another, as illustrated by skin grafts, electrophoretic evidence and reproductive surveys. A prolonged period of inbreeding, following a genetic bottleneck during the last ice age, {{is believed to be the}} reason behind this anomaly. The consequences of such genetic uniformity might include a low sperm count, decreased sperm motility, deformed flagella, difficulty in captive breeding and susceptibility to disease.|$|E

5000|$|Local legends {{state that}} the name, which {{literally}} means [...] "Cat's Lagoon", was used by its first explorers after sighting a few <b>margays</b> at a small lagoon.|$|R
50|$|<b>Margays</b> have {{recently}} been discovered to hunt by mimicking the vocalisation of a prey species, pied tamarin (Saguinus bicolor), which has been compared by scientists to tool-use by monkeys.|$|R
50|$|Female <b>margays</b> are in estrus {{for four}} to ten days over a cycle of 32 to 36 days, during which they attract males with a long, moaning call. The male {{responds}} by yelping or making trilling sounds, and also by rapidly shaking his {{head from side to}} side, a behavior not seen in any other cat species. Copulation lasts up to sixty seconds, and is similar to that in domestic cats; it takes place primarily in the trees, and occurs several times while the female is in heat. Unlike other felid species, <b>margays</b> are not induced ovulators.|$|R
25|$|The Belize Zoo {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of mammals, {{including}} Belize's national animal, the Baird's tapir, and the five wildcat species found in Belize: (jaguar, puma, ocelot, <b>margay,</b> and jaguarundi). Other mammals include white-tailed deer, red brocket, spider monkey, howler monkey, greater grison, white-lipped peccary, collared peccary, and kinkajou.|$|E
25|$|The highest upland {{watershed}} area contains expansive forests, {{which are}} primary {{in the highest}} elevations and secondary in the lower foothills of the Maya Mountains. These montane areas provided an impenetrable protective backdrop for the ancient Mayan settlements here, preventing invasion from any tribes resident in Honduras or Guatemala. These forests have important lumber species such as mahogany and cedar trees and a broad panoply of other broadleaf tree species as well as numerous lianas. Fauna include the jaguar, <b>margay,</b> tapir and venomous pit viper Fer-de-lance, Bothrops asper.|$|E
25|$|The wild canids {{found in}} Brazil are the maned wolf, bush dog, hoary fox, short-eared dog, crab-eating fox and pampas fox. The felines found in Brazil are the jaguar, the puma, the <b>margay,</b> the ocelot, the oncilla, and the jaguarundi. Other notable animals include the giant anteater, several {{varieties}} of sloths and armadillos, coati, giant river otter, tapir, peccaries, marsh deer, Pampas deer, and capybara (the world's largest existing rodent). There are around 75 primate species, including the howler monkey, the capuchin monkey, and the squirrel monkey, the marmoset, and the tamarin.|$|E
50|$|Fossil {{evidence}} of <b>margays</b> or margay-like cats {{has been found}} in Florida and Georgia dating to the Pleistocene, suggesting that they had a wider distribution in the past. The last record from Texas was from 1852.|$|R
25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{traditional}} day time tour of the zoo, visitors are able to arrange night tours of the zoo, to see activity of the crepuscular and nocturnal animals. The animals on the tour include the tapirs, jaguars, <b>margays,</b> kinkajous, crocodiles, peccaries and howler monkeys.|$|R
50|$|The path {{continues}} {{past the}} enclosures of the <b>margays</b> (Leopardus wiedi), Geoffroy's cats (Oncifelis geoffroyi), the oncillas (Leopardus tigrinus), and the pumas (Puma concolor). Finally one {{arrives at a}} dead end, to admire the jaguarundis (Herpailurus yaguarondi) which are very rare in European zoos.|$|R
2500|$|This [...] "black cougar" [...] {{was most}} likely a <b>margay</b> or ocelot, which are under [...] in weight, live in trees, and do have melanistic phases.|$|E
2500|$|The oncilla {{resembles the}} <b>margay</b> and the ocelot, {{but it is}} smaller, with a slender build and {{narrower}} muzzle. It grows to [...] long, plus a [...] tail. While this is somewhat longer than the average domestic cat, Leopardus tigrinus is generally lighter, weighing [...]|$|E
2500|$|Trogons are {{generally}} inactive outside of infrequent feeding flights. Among birdwatchers and biologists {{it has been}} noted that [...] "part from their great beauty [...] are notorious ... for their lack of other immediately engaging qualities". Their lack of activity is possibly a defence against predation; trogons on all continents {{have been reported to}} shift about on branches to always keep their less brightly coloured backs turned towards observers, while their heads, which like owls can turn through 180 degrees, keep a watch on the watcher. Trogons have reportedly been preyed upon by hawks and predatory mammals; one report was of a resplendent quetzal taken while brooding young by a <b>margay.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Pale-throated sloths are solitary, herbivorous {{animals that}} spend almost {{their entire lives}} in trees. Depending on habitat, {{population}} densities of anything from [...] have been reported. They eat only leaves, including those of Cecropia, Ceiba, Elizabetha, and Hevea. Known predators include jaguars, <b>margays,</b> harpy eagles, and anacondas.|$|R
50|$|While <b>margays</b> are nocturnal, in {{some areas}} they have also been {{observed}} to hunt during the day. They prefer {{to spend most of}} their life in the trees, but also travel across the ground, especially when moving between hunting areas. During the day, they rest in relatively inaccessible branches or clumps of lianas.|$|R
25|$|The white-headed {{capuchin}} is {{native to}} the forests of the province, as is the mantled howler. Other mammals native to Alajuela include Baird's tapir, the giant anteater, the silky anteater, <b>margays,</b> ocelots, and other wild cats. Jaguars, while rarely seen, also inhabit the province's national parks. Deer are native to the highlands {{as well as the}} Northern Plains.|$|R
2500|$|This primate is a {{medium-sized}} monkey {{with a light}} brown back and a creamy white underside. Like other capuchin monkeys, it is omnivorous, feeding primarily on fruits, invertebrates, other plant parts and sometimes small vertebrates. It is predated upon primarily by raptors and probably small cats, especially the <b>margay,</b> though snakes {{have been known to}} attack the species. It is a polygamous animal and lives on fairly large groups of 15 to 35 individuals, reproductive females give birth to a single young at biennial intervals. The species maintains a home range of [...] and has a complex vocal repertoire. It {{is one of the few}} primates to have been observed crafting and utilising tools in the wild.|$|E
50|$|<b>Margay</b> {{has been}} around karting almost since karting began. The company started out in 1964 making {{gearboxes}} for karts then tried building chassis. It {{proved to be an}} instant success. <b>Margay</b> has built more than 20,000 chassis and has won more races in the World Karting Association (WKA) than any other manufacturer. Current <b>Margay</b> team drivers who have enjoyed success including WKA triple crowns, manufacturer cups, and championships include Corey Reeves, Eric Morrow, and Caleb Loniewski. <b>Margay</b> is also a large distributor of Bridgestone tires.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} one report of a <b>margay</b> using {{auditory}} mimicry to try to lure one of its prey. A <b>margay</b> was observed to imitate the call of a pied tamarin infant while {{in the presence of}} a group of adult tamarins, leading the adults to investigate. While the <b>margay</b> was not successful in catching one of the monkeys, this represents the first observation of a Neotropical predator employing this type of mimicry.|$|E
50|$|Felines, {{especially}} domestic cats, {{are well}} known for having penile spines. Upon withdrawal of a cat's penis, the spines rake {{the walls of the}} female's vagina, which may serve as a trigger for ovulation. Many other felid species have penile spines, but they are relatively small in jaguars and pumas, and do not occur in <b>margays.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Bengal is a {{domestic}} cat breed developed {{to look like}} exotic jungle cats such as leopards, ocelots, <b>margays</b> and clouded leopards. Bengal cats were developed by selective breeding from hybrids of the Asian leopard cat (ALC), Prionailurus bengalensis bengalensis, with domestic cat, backcrossed to domestic cats, {{with the goal of}} creating a confident, healthy, and friendly cat with a highly contrasted and vividly marked coat.|$|R
50|$|Because the <b>margay</b> {{is mostly}} nocturnal and is {{naturally}} rare in its environment, most dietary {{studies have been}} based on stomach contents and faecal analysis. This cat hunts small mammals, including monkeys, and birds, eggs, lizards and tree frogs. It also eats grass, fruit and other vegetation, most likely to help digestion. A 2006 report about a <b>margay</b> chasing squirrels in its natural environment confirmed that the <b>margay</b> is able to hunt its prey entirely in trees. However, margays do sometimes hunt on the ground, and have been reported to eat terrestrial prey, such as cane rats and guinea pigs.|$|E

50|$|In 1982, MARENA {{established}} seasonal hunting bans for 26 {{endangered species}} of mammals and 4 species of reptiles. This was {{in response to}} Nicaragua being a world leader in the export of rare and endangered species such as White-lipped peccaries, White-tailed deer, hawksbill turtles, freshwater otters, jaguars, ocelots, and <b>margays.</b> Educational campaigns were initiated by MARENA, along with marketplace and roadside inspections. By 1985, however, many of these bans were lifted because of the growing economic crisis in the country.|$|R
50|$|The National Park is an {{important}} refuge for rare species of the Andes, like mountain tapirs and spectacled bears. Especially for the mountain tapir, the park {{is one of the}} most important strongholds.Typical species of the alpine and subalpine areas are mountain tapirs, Northern South American cougars and Andean foxes. In the forests below live spectacled bears, giant otters, Ecuadorian jaguars, ocelots, <b>margays,</b> Brazilian tapirs, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus ustus), little red brocket deer and Northern Pudus. About 300-400 bird species inhabit the Park.|$|R
50|$|Gestation lasts about 80 days, and {{generally}} {{results in the}} birth of a single kitten (very rarely, there are two) usually between March and June. Kittens weigh 85 to 170 g at birth. This is relatively large for a small cat, and is probably related to the long gestation period. The kittens open their eyes at around two weeks of age, and begin to take solid food at seven to eight weeks. <b>Margays</b> reach sexual maturity at twelve to eighteen months of age, and have been reported to live up to twenty-four years in captivity.|$|R
