5000|$|This {{story begins}} with <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts,</b> her baby son, and her Aunt Mary headed Westbound on the Boston and Albany Railroad. They {{are on their}} way to meet Mrs. Roberts' husband and brother in Boston. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> has not seen her brother in twelve years, and is nervous about how he will react to seeing her. In the time since they last saw each other, she has married and birthed a child, and has heard little from her brother except for {{infrequent}} telegraphs. The porter informs <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> and her aunt that the berths are now ready for them to sleep in, but the conversation continues. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> worries that her husband Edward will not receive Willis well, or vice versa, because Willis is a Californian and Edward has never encountered one before. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> laments that her life would be a wreck if her husband and brother do not get along nicely, and states [...] "I do hope they're sitting down to a hot supper." ...|$|R

5000|$|A {{voice from}} an {{adjacent}} berth interjects and sarcastically tells <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> to be quiet. She acquiesces for a moment, but then reverts to conversation, stating how they {{must go to}} bed. Aunt Mary insists that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> and the child take the bottom bunk, because she is afraid that the child will roll off of the top bunk and injure himself. She calls the porter over to help her into the upper berth, and after successfully entering the berth, exchanges [...] "good-night" [...] with <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{school system}} is led by its seven-member School Committee that is elected to serve {{for two years and}} {{includes}} a Chairperson, Vice-chairperson and Clerk. The School Committee hires a Superintendent of Schools to administer policies and to manage and lead learning in the district. The Cumberland Superintendent of Schools (in chronological order) are <b>Mr.</b> <b>Robert</b> Condon, Dr. <b>Robert</b> McGinnis, <b>Mr.</b> Rodney McFarlin, Dr. <b>Robert</b> Patterson, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Robert</b> Wallace (1993-1996), <b>Mr.</b> Joseph Nasif (1996-2005), Dr. Donna Morelle (2005-2011), Dr. Phil Thornton (2011-2015, and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Robert</b> Mitchell (2015-present).|$|R
50|$|After a few minutes, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> rekindles the conversation, and expresses {{her concern}} {{regarding}} {{the safety of}} the train on which they're riding. Her aunt reassures her that the road is safe, and that the train has implemented safety measures to prevent accidents. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> then goes on to discuss where her Aunt left the drinking glass in their luggage, until she is interrupted by a man from the next berth. This man politely requests silence from <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts,</b> citing that he has come straight through from San Francisco and would very much like some rest. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> responds apologetically, but starts conversing with this man, inquiring about California, her brother Willis, and if he has ever met his acquaintance. Midway through their conversation, a man in the upper berth sarcastically interjects and asks for quiet. The Californian takes offense to the man's tone towards <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts,</b> and the two get into a verbal argument over it. Eventually, the Californian gets the man in the upper berth to back down ("You beg that lady's pardon, or I'll have you out of there before you know yourself!"). Part I ends with the Californian and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> finally going to bed, with only the sounds of Aunt Mary's snoring audible.|$|R

5000|$|The {{neurosis}} of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> {{is another}} point of humor. She frequently states [...] "good-night" [...] to Aunt Mary in part I, but always revives the conversation by expressing some sort of worry, insecurity, or anxiety. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> expresses initially her worry about how her brother and husband will interact, and needs constant reassurance from her aunt to calm down. Minutes later, she {{is concerned about the}} safety of the train, whose creaking noises stir worry about her safety and the safety of her baby son. Aunt Mary again alleviates her stress by citing all of the safety measures the railroad has implemented (i.e. the well-managed road, air-brake, and Miller Platform). After this anxiety passes, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> frets about where the water glass is packed in the luggage, and decides to talk herself through its retrieval. The intense neurosis of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> is comically pathetic, and quite extreme. Effortlessly moving from one point of anxiety to the next, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> creates a feeling of persistent neurosis for the reader, who must simply laugh at the woeful worry.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Roberts</b> {{was a man}} of business, or {{agent to}} the property, who lived at Shrewsbury, and whom Mr. Greenwood {{especially}} disliked. Mr. Greenwood being a clergyman was, of course, supposed to be a gentleman, and regarded <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roberts</b> as being much beneath himself. It was not customary for <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roberts</b> to dine at the house, and he was therefore regarded by the chaplain as being hardly more than an upper servant. It was therefore very grievous to him to be told that he must discuss his own private affairs and make his renewed request as to the living through <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roberts.</b> It was evidently intended that he should have no opportunity of discussing his private affairs. Whatever the Marquis might offer him he must take; and that, {{as far as he could}} see, without any power of redress on his side. If <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roberts</b> were to offer him a thousand pounds, he could only accept the cheque and depart with it from Trafford Park, shaking off from his feet the dust which such ingratitude would forbid him to carry with him.|$|R
