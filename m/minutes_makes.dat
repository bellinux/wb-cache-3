The first performance was in Salzburg in November 1776.

[...] A landing party from Sparrow captured and destroyed the strongholds of Tambi and Toniatuba in 1892, in reprisal for attacks on tribes under British protection. On 27 August 1896 she played a part in the Anglo-Zanzibar War, whose duration of 40 <b>minutes</b> <b>makes</b> it the shortest war in history.

50|$|Limited {{stock is}} the most {{representative}} technique of hunger marketing. It {{is also one of}} the strongest causes, which affects consumers directly and most powerfully. Many companies have not supplied their items adequately. Because it is hard for consumers to get and buy the product, they think that the item is really good and popular. As a result of this strategy, companies could get higher reputation of their items. Xiaomi has a strong strategy to supply their items inadequately so that they can do good inventory management and control the costs of shipping. Also, they can get increased demand. By restricting their supply, companies could make a kind of rumor that the item they sell is really good and add higher value to their product and even the price of their product, because the fact people wait in long lines or a product sold out in a couple of <b>minutes</b> <b>makes</b> people have illusion that the item seems really amazing.|$|E

5000|$|The film stars dancer Eleanor Powell {{and was a}} {{follow-up}} to her successful debut in Broadway Melody of 1936. The film co-stars James Stewart as Powell's love interest and Virginia Bruce as the film's resident femme fatale and Powell's rival. Powell's Broadway Melody co-stars Buddy Ebsen and Frances Langford return to provide comedy and musical support. Highlights of the film include a rare musical number by Stewart (which the actor later poked fun at in the That's Entertainment! retrospective), and a bombastic finale called [...] "Swingin' the Jinx Away". Set amidst a pre-Second World War naval backdrop, the Depression-era [...] "feel good" [...] number (which runs nearly 10 <b>minutes)</b> <b>makes</b> topical references {{to the economy and}} political leaders (with a [...] "shout out" [...] to Cab Calloway thrown in for good measure) sung by Powell, adds in an eccentric dance routine by Ebsen, and ends in a flurry of tap dancing by Powell culminating in a patriotic salute, and finally a blast of cannon fire. This finale was also lifted in its entirety and re-used in another Powell film, I Dood It, co-starring Red Skelton. Although considered one of Powell's (and MGM's) most memorable musical numbers, and often featured in retrospectives such as That's Entertainment!, musical director Roger Edens was often quoted as being embarrassed by the segment.|$|E
5000|$|The album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Kerrang! gave it 4/5 citing that {{if anyone was}} bored with the band in the past, they don't understand music, while MusicOMH, and The Music Fix both awarded it 8/10. Contact Music were also positive in their review, while Q were negative with a 2/5. Max Raymond of MusicOMH suggested that [...] "Renegades, quite unexpectedly, {{is one of the}} best British rock albums you will hear all year". Will Dean of BBC Online did not praise the album giving it a mixed response by at first giving [...] "White Lines" [...] high approval before saying keeping each track to 3 <b>minutes</b> <b>makes</b> it look like the band are making excuses before slating the lyrics of [...] "City in a Rut" [...] and duration of [...] "Barking Dogs".

50|$|The longest-known {{track for}} a single tornado is the Tri-State Tornado with a path length of 151 to 235 mi. For years there was debate whether the {{originally}} recognized path length of 219 mi over 3.5 hours was from one tornado or a series. Some very long track (VLT) tornadoes were later determined to be successive tornadoes spawned by the same supercell thunderstorm, which are known as a tornado family. The Tri-State Tornado, however, appeared to have no gaps in the damage. A six-year reanalysis study {{by a team of}} severe convective storm meteorologists found insufficient evidence to make firm conclusions but does conclude that {{it is likely that the}} beginning and ending of the path was resultant of separate tornadoes comprising a tornado family. It also found that the tornado began 15 mi to the west and ended 1 mi farther east than previously known, bringing the total path to 235 mi. The 174 mi segment from central Madison County, Missouri to Pike County, Indiana is likely one continuous tornado and the 151 mi segment from central Bollinger County, Missouri to western Pike County, Indiana is very likely a single continuous tornado. Another significant tornado was found about 65 mi east-northeast of the end of aforementioned segment(s) of the Tri-State Tornado Family and is likely another member of the family. Its path length of 20 mi over about 20 <b>minutes</b> <b>makes</b> the known tornado family path length total to 320 mi over about 5½ hours. Grazulis in 2001 wrote that the first 60 mi of the (originally recognized) track is probably the result of two or more tornadoes and that a path length of 157 mi was seemingly continuous.|$|E

40|$|The {{damage to}} the surface {{structure}} of Anodic Aluminum Oxide (AAO) caused by plasma and heat is evaluated {{with respect to the}} sealing time (0, 10, 30 and 60 minutes). With 10 minutes sealing time of the oxide layer, the leakage current is abruptly reduced, while the breakdown voltage and permittivity are rapidly improved. Longer sealing after 10 <b>minutes</b> <b>makes</b> less efficiencies. In the samples sealed for 30 or 60 minutes, more cracks are generated by plasma and heat treatments, result in the reduction of the breakdown voltage. Sealing longer than 10 minutes produces much contamination particles by plasma treatment. The resistance to plasma and heat is improved with a sealing time of 10 minutes...|$|E
