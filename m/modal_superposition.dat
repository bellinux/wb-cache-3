40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The final {{published}} version is available from: [URL] paper {{deals with the}} dynamic analysis of primary-secondary combined systems. The problem of selecting the vibrational modes to be retained in analysis is first addressed, for the case of secondary substructures which may possess numerous lowfrequency modes with negligible mass, and a dynamic mode acceleration method (DyMAM) is adopted {{in view of the}} application for seismic analysis. The influence of various approaches to build the viscous damping matrix of the primary-secondary assembly is then investigated, and a novel technique based on <b>modal</b> damping <b>superposition</b> is proposed. The results of a parametric study for a representative staircase system multi-connected to a two-dimensional multi-storey frame reveal that the DyMAM correction is capable of increasing the response accuracy with a reduced number of modes compared to the classical MAM (modal acceleration method). Furthermore, a new technique is proposed for assembling the damping matrix, which is shown to be a convenient alternative for modelling the dissipative forces in composite systems. Indeed, while mass and stiffness matrices can unambiguously be defined, various assumptions can be made for the damping matrix, inducing considerable variation in the predicted seismic response...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{vibrations}} often {{cause problems}} in high precision instruments, {{which may be}} solved by introducing passive damping. In this paper, different ways of introducing passive damping via viscoelastic materials (VEM) are discussed. Discrete damping elements and constrained layer (CL) configurations are selected and used to efficiently damp an open aluminum box. For the constrained layer configurations, a distinction is made between full and partial coverage of the structure. The steady-state dynamics of the box are simulated using a finite element (FE) model, which includes frequency dependent VEM properties. This model is used to find a design that possesses high damping while taking into account design constraints. The simulation results are experimentally validated using both modal parameters and frequency response functions (FRFs). For the computation of model based FRFs, a new method based on Interpolated <b>Modal</b> Parameter <b>Superposition</b> (IMPS) is proposed. Model based results and experimental results show good resemblance, even without updating the model with deviations in the realized structure. The local dampers add most damping to {{a limited number of}} modes.

The proposed method is applied to a special switched reluctance motor with asymmetric pole geometry to improve the start-up torque.

The field-circuit coupling is based on a temporary lumped-parameter model of the magnetic part incorporated into a circuit simulation based on the modified nodal analysis. The harmonic force excitation is calculated by means of stress tensor computation, and it is transformed to a mechanical mesh by mapping techniques.

40|$|To {{understand}} the dynamic mechanisms {{of the mechanical}} milling process in a vibratory mill, {{it is necessary to}} determine the characteristics of the impact forces associated with the collision events. However, it is difficult to directly measure the impact force in an operating mill. This paper describes an inverse technique for the prediction of impact forces from acceleration measurements on a vibratory ball mill. The characteristics of the vibratory mill have been investigated by the modal testing technique, and its system modes have been identified. In the modelling of the system vibration response to the impact forces, two modal equations have been used to describe the <b>modal</b> responses. The <b>superposition</b> of the <b>modal</b> responses gives rise to the total response of the system. A method based on an optimisation approach has been developed to predict the impact forces by minimising the difference between the measured acceleration of the vibratory ball mill and the predicted acceleration from the solution of the modal equations. The predicted and measured impact forces are in good agreement. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Pressure-impulse (P-I) {{diagrams}} {{are commonly}} used to assess damage of structural components subjected to blast loading. The response to blast loading is characterized by three main aspects: (a) the excitation of higher modes of vibration, (b) strain rate effects, and (c) ductility. P-I diagrams are often based on equivalent single degree of freedom (SDOF) systems. These SDOF systems can take strain rate effects and ductility into account, to a certain extent, but the influence of higher modes is neglected. All three aspects can be incorporated in finite element simulations, but {{at the cost of}} generality and comprehensibility. For a better understanding, this theoretical study derives P-I diagrams including higher modes, without strain rate effects and ductility. These P-I diagrams are derived for a continuous, linear-elastic, cantilevered Timoshenko beam, which represents the load-bearing structure of a multistory building, subjected to idealized blast loading. The response is determined analytically using mode <b>superposition.</b> <b>Modal</b> contribution factors for dynamic base shear are derived, based on earthquake engineering. For the material behaviour and boundary conditions investigated, it is concluded that P-I diagrams based on equivalent SDOF systems are not conservative for short-duration (impulsive) loading, and non-uniform spatial load distributions. Moreover, the shape of the P-I diagrams that have been derived, deviates significantly from the hyperbolic shape of P-I diagrams for SDOF systems...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} research {{regarding the}} trapping of water waves through hydroelastic interaction with bottom-mounted cylinder arrays in shallow water. A <b>modal</b> decomposition and <b>superposition</b> {{approach has been}} applied to the calculation of the hydro-elastic response of arrays of deformable cylinders exposed to incident long waves. The cylinder array is considered as an effective medium, and the theory associated with the Fabry-P?rot Interferometer is applied. Therefore, the refraction index within the array and the transmittance and reflectance by the array can be determined. Equations of motion for a single deformable cylinder are derived from the theory of vibration for thin shells, and added mass, radiation damping and stiffness matrices are defined. Analytical solutions for the response of a single deformable cylinder are calculated and compared with the numerical results from WAMIT. The results show a good agreement. Transmission and reflection coefficients for rigid cylinder arrays have been calculated based on effective medium theory and found to match those determined from WAMIT. The final step of the research involves investigating the hydro-elastic response of deformable cylinder arrays exposed to incident waves. Wave interactions of arrays of elastic cylinders that can expand and contract radially are simulated using WAMIT, and the associated wave fields within and outside the array are analyzed and discussed. The main objective of this research is to investigate whether significant ?wave trapping? can occur when waves encounter elastic cylinders arranged in periodic or random arrays. If the insertion loss calculated in the case of flexible cylinder arrays is significant, one may conclude that in shallow water those arrays could attenuate incident long waves of certain frequencies. The research is motivated by analogous theories of wave trapping that can occur when acoustic waves encounter bubbly media, such as breaking water waves. Furthermore, such arrangement of pulsating cylinders may lead to novel ways of extracting wave energy through hydro-mechanical coupling with suitable devices...|$|R

Various engineering structures, such as, bridges, wind towers, among others are subjected to cyclic dynamic loading which may substantially reduce the strength of these structures. Nowadays, the structures {{tend to be more}} complex and it is necessary to find computationally efficient solutions to perform their {{fatigue analysis}}, for dynamic actions corresponding to long complex loading events (e. g. diversity of trains crossing a bridge).

40|$|Abstract. Software {{packages}} for multi-body system (MBS) dynamics are efficient tools for modeling interconnected rigid and/or flexible bodies. Consideration of flexible bodies in commercially available MBS software packages {{is limited to}} linear elastic behavior.

Furthermore, Galerkin?s finite element method is used to generate mass, stiffness and damping coefficient matrices of a single mooring line.
