25|$|Recently <b>Multi-Photon</b> Processing (MPP) was {{employed}} for in vivo expperiments by engineering artificial cartilage constructs.

The achieved biocompatibility was comparable to the commercially available collagen membranes. The successful outcome of this study supports the idea that hexagonal-pore-shaped hybrid organic-inorganic microstructured scaffolds in combination with Cho seeding may be successfully implemented for cartilage tissue engineering.|$|E

2500|$|The pulses {{generated}} by the detector are processed by pulse-shaping amplifiers.

50|$|In QKD protocols, such as BB84, {{a single}} photon source {{is assumed to}} be used by the sender, Alice. In reality, a perfect single photon source does not exist. Instead, {{practical}} sources, such as weak coherent state laser source, are widely used for QKD. The key problem with these practical QKD sources is the <b>multi-photon</b> components which they contain. A serious security loophole exists when Alice uses <b>multi-photon</b> states as quantum information carriers. In order to minimize the effects of <b>multi-photon</b> states, Alice has to use an extremely weak laser source, which results in a relatively low speed of QKD. Decoy state QKD is proposed to solve this <b>multi-photon</b> issue by using a few different photon intensities instead of one. With decoy states, the practical sources, such as a coherent-state source or heralded parametric down-conversion (PDC) source, perform almost as well as a single photon source.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Multi-photon</b> absorption, {{simultaneous}} {{absorption of}} two or more photons, transferring the energy to a single electron.|$|E
50|$|In <b>multi-photon</b> {{ionization}} (MPI), several photons {{of energy}} below the ionization threshold may actually combine their energies to ionize an atom.|$|E
50|$|The {{principles}} governing {{this mode}} of ionization are very simple. Localized plasma must be generated in predictable fashion, under the optical breakdown threshold. Optical breakdown intensity threshold is strongly correlated to the input intensity only at short pulse durations. Therefore, one important requirement, in order to systematically avoid the optical breakdown, is to operate at short pulse durations. In order for the ionization to take place, <b>multi-photon</b> ionization (MPI)intensity threshold must be reached. The idea is to adjust {{the duration of the}} laser pulse so that <b>multi-photon</b> ionization, and perhaps to a lesser extent avalanche ionization, have no time to raise the plasma’s density above the critical value.In the UV, the distinction between single-photon mode (SP) and B/OB is that for the latter <b>multi-photon</b> ionization, single-photon ionization, and perhaps to a lesser extent avalanche ionization, are operating, whereas for the former, only single-photon ionization is operating.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} photoionization {{processes}} involved in optical breakdown, which depend on the wavelength, local intensity, and pulse duration, {{as well as on}} the electronic structure of the material. First, we should mention that optical breakdown is only observed at very high intensities. For pulse durations greater than a few tens of fs avalanche ionization plays a role. The longer pulse duration, the greater the avalanche ionization’s contribution. <b>Multi-photon</b> ionization processes are important in the fs time regime, and their role increases as the pulse duration decreases. The type of <b>multi-photon</b> ionization processes involved is also wavelength dependent.|$|E
5000|$|In atomic, molecular, {{and optical}} physics, above {{threshold}} ionization (ATI), is a <b>multi-photon</b> effect where an atom is ionized {{with more than}} the energetically required number of photons. [...] It was first observed in 1979.|$|E

5000|$|The {{physics of}} strong-(laser)field {{interaction}} with matter, {{to account for}} the plasma formation. As opposed to the OB mode, in this case the role of avalanche ionization is greatly reduced, and the effects are dominated by <b>multi-photon</b> ionization processes.|$|E
50|$|The Mueller/Stokes {{architecture}} {{can also}} be used to describe nonlinear optical processes, such as <b>multi-photon</b> excited fluorescence and second harmonic generation. The Mueller tensor can be connected back to the laboratory-frame Jones tensor by direct analogy with Mueller and Jones matrices.|$|E

50|$|Widefield endomicroscopes (i.e. non-depth {{sectioning}} microscopes) {{have been}} developed for select applications, including the imaging of cells ex vivo. Optical coherence tomography and <b>multi-photon</b> microscopy have both been demonstrated endoscopically. Successful implementations have used distal scanning rather than fibre bundles due to problems with dispersion and light loss.|$|E

50|$|Currently {{production}} of heavy Rydberg systems relies on complex vacuum ultra-violet (so called {{because it is}} strongly absorbed in air and requires the entire system to be enclosed within a vacuum chamber) or <b>multi-photon</b> transitions (relying on absorption of multiple photons almost simultaneously), {{both of which are}} rather inefficient and result in systems with high internal energy.|$|E
50|$|STARlight is {{designed}} to handle complex reactions involving multiple photon exchange between a single ion pair. These reactions are important at heavy ion colliders, because, with the large nuclear charges, the probability of <b>multi-photon</b> interactions in near grazing collisions (impact parameter b just slightly above twice the nuclear radius) is large. STARlight does this by calculating cross-sections in an impact-parameter dependent formalism.|$|E
50|$|VLPC {{stands for}} visible-light photon counter and {{refers to a}} new high quantum {{efficiency}} <b>multi-photon</b> counting detector, which operates at visible wavelengths. The ability {{to be capable of}} counting the exact number of photons that are detected is extremely important for QKD. The device is being used extensively in the central tracking detector of the D0 experiment, and for muon cooling studies for a muon collider (MICE).|$|E
50|$|Operations via linear optical {{elements}} (beam splitters, {{mirrors and}} phase shifters, in this case) preserve the photon statistics of input light. For example, a coherent (classical) light input produces a coherent light output; a superposition of quantum states input yields a quantum light state output. Due to this reason, people usually use single photon source case {{to analyze the}} effect of linear optical elements and operators. <b>Multi-photon</b> cases can be implied through some statistical transformations.|$|E
5000|$|The basic {{polarization}} rotation scheme has been implemented in hardware by Pramode Verma in the quantum optics laboratory of the University of Oklahoma. In this method {{more than one}} photon {{can be used in}} the exchange between Alice and Bob and, therefore, it opens up the possibility of <b>multi-photon</b> quantum cryptography. This works so long as the number of photons siphoned off by the eavesdropper is not sufficient to determine the polarization angles.|$|E

50|$|When {{either the}} laser {{intensity}} is further increased or a longer wavelength is applied {{as compared with}} the regime in which <b>multi-photon</b> ionization takes place, a quasi-stationary approach can be used and results in the distortion of the atomic potential {{in such a way that}} only a relatively low and narrow barrier between a bound state and the continuum states remains. Then, the electron can tunnel through or for larger distortions even overcome this barrier. These phenomena are called tunnel ionization and over-the-barrier ionization, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Raman {{signal is}} {{inherently}} weak; therefore for short detection times at small sample volumes in microfluidic devices, signal amplification is utilized. Some microfluidic systems utilize metallic colloids or nanoparticles within solution {{to capitalize on}} Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) as a detection technique. Typical confocal Raman microscopy allows for spectroscopic information from small focal volumes less 1 micron cubed, and thus smaller than the microfluidic channel dimensions. <b>Multi-photon</b> Raman spectroscopy, such as stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) or coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) also enhance signal from substances in microfluidic devices.|$|E
50|$|Hence, multiphoton {{lithography}} is {{a technique}} for creating small features in a photosensitive material, {{without the use of}} complex optical systems or photomasks. This method relies on a <b>multi-photon</b> absorption process in a material that is transparent at the wavelength of the laser used for creating the pattern. By scanning and properly modulating the laser, a chemical change (usually polymerization) occurs at the focal spot of the laser and can be controlled to create an arbitrary three-dimensional periodic or non-periodic pattern. This method has been used for rapid prototyping of structures with fine features.|$|E
5000|$|Photofragment ion imaging or, more generally, Product Imaging is an {{experimental}} technique for making {{measurements of the}} velocity of product molecules or particles following a chemical reaction or the photodissociation of a parent molecule. [...] The method uses a two-dimensional detector, usually a microchannel plate, to record the arrival positions of state-selected ions created by resonantly enhanced <b>multi-photon</b> ionization (REMPI). The first experiment using photofragment ion imaging was performed by David W Chandler and Paul L Houston in 1987 on the phototodissociation dynamics of methyl iodide (iodomethane, CH3I).|$|E
50|$|Endomicroscopy is a {{technique}} for obtaining histology-like images from inside the human body in real-time, {{a process known as}} ‘optical biopsy’. It generally refers to fluorescence confocal microscopy, although <b>multi-photon</b> microscopy and optical coherence tomography have also been adapted for endoscopic use. Commercially available clinical endomicroscopes can achieve a resolution on the order of a micrometre, have a field-of-view of several hundred µm, and are compatible with fluorophores which are excitable using 488 nm laser light. The main applications are currently in imaging of the gastro-intestinal tract, particularly for the diagnosis and characterisation of Barrett’s Esophagus, pancreatic cysts and colorectal lesions.|$|E
50|$|In the {{simplest}} case, a single photon has sufficient energy {{to overcome the}} ionization potential. This process is therefore called single photon ionization, it is the basic principle of atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI).For sufficiently high power densities of the incident light also nonlinear absorption processes like the absorption {{of at least two}} photons in a rapid sequence via virtual or real states can occur. If the combined energy of the absorbed photons is higher than the ionization potential, this multiphoton absorption process can also lead to ionization of the atom or molecule. This process is called <b>multi-photon</b> ionization (MPI).|$|E
50|$|Not every photon which {{encounters}} an atom or ion will photoionize it. The {{probability of}} photoionization {{is related to}} the photoionization cross-section, which depends on the energy of the photon and the target being considered. For photon energies below the ionization threshold, the photoionization cross-section is near zero. But with the development of pulsed lasers it has become possible to create extremely intense, coherent light where <b>multi-photon</b> ionization may occur. At even higher intensities (around 1015 - 1016 W/cm2 of infrared or visible light), non-perturbative phenomena such as barrier suppression ionization and rescattering ionization are observed.|$|E
5000|$|Above {{threshold}} ionization (ATI) [...] is {{an extension}} of <b>multi-photon</b> ionization where even more photons are absorbed than actually would be necessary to ionize the atom. The excess energy gives the released electron higher kinetic energy than the usual case of just-above threshold ionization. More precisely, The system will have multiple peaks in its photoelectron spectrum which are separated by the photon energies, this indicates that the emitted electron has more kinetic energy than in the normal (lowest possible number of photons) ionization case. The electrons released from the target will have approximately an integer number of photon-energies more kinetic energy.|$|E
5000|$|In recent years, {{chemical}} tags {{have been}} tailored to advanced imaging technologies {{more so than}} fluorescent proteins {{due to the fact}} that chemical tags can localize photosensitizers closer to the target proteins. Proteins can then be labeled and detected with imaging such as super-resolution microscopy, Ca2+-imaging, pH sensing, hydrogen peroxide detection, chromophore assisted light inactivation, and <b>multi-photon</b> light microscopy. In vivo imaging studies in live animals have been performed for the first time with the use of a monomeric protein derived from the bacterial haloalkane dehalogenase known as the Halo-tag. [...] The Halo-tag covalently links to its ligand and allows for better expression of soluble proteins.|$|E
5000|$|To {{prepare a}} desired <b>multi-photon</b> quantum state for LOQC, a single-photon state is first required. Therefore, {{non-linear}} optical elements, such as single-photon generators and some optical modules, will be employed. For example, optical parametric down-conversion {{can be used}} to conditionally generate the [...] state in the vertical polarization channel at time [...] (subscripts are ignored for this single qubit case). By using a conditional single-photon source, the output state is guaranteed, although this may require several attempts (depending on the success rate). A joint multi-qubit state can be prepared in a similar way. In general, an arbitrary quantum state can be generated for QIP with a proper set of photon sources.|$|E
50|$|Several {{improvements}} in microscopy techniques have been invented in the 20th century and {{have resulted in}} increased resolution and contrast to some extent. However they did not overcome the diffraction limit. In 1978 first theoretical ideas {{have been developed to}} break this barrier by using a 4Pi microscope as a confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope where the light is focused ideally from all sides to a common focus which is used to scan the object by 'point-by-point' excitation combined with 'point-by-point' detection.However, the first experimental demonstration of the 4pi microscope took place in 1994. 4Pi microscopy maximizes the amount of available focusing directions by using two opposing objective lenses or Two-photon excitation microscopy using redshifted light and <b>multi-photon</b> excitation.|$|E
5000|$|Above {{threshold}} ionization (ATI) [...] is {{an extension}} of <b>multi-photon</b> ionization where even more photons are absorbed than actually would be necessary to ionize the atom.

The electrons released from the target will have approximately an integer number of photon-energies more kinetic energy. In intensity regions between 1014 W/cm2 and 1018 W/cm2, each of MPI, ATI, and barrier suppression ionization can occur simultaneously, each contributing to the overall ionization of the atoms involved.|$|E
