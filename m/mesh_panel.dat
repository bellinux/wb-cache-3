The low escape-panel contact found in the selected species, {{especially in the case of}} the hake can be attributed to different factors such as passive behaviour in the trawl, high turbidity and high trawling speed.

Though a center of gravity in this field of research lies in the EUproject BACOMA (participants Finland Sweden, Denmark) also the corresponding national institutes of other Baltic countries (Germany, Poland, Russia) have been active with similar investigations. German experiments in 1999 dealt with the effect of the use of netting made of double instead of single yarn on the selectivity. Further research was done on modifications of codends made from netting turned 90 ° from its original orientation and on simplified versions of the so-called Multipanel codend which consists of three equal diamond and three square <b>mesh</b> <b>panels.</b> The experiments demonstrated on the one hand a definite deterioration of the selective properties in a codend made from double instead of single yarn. Constructional changes in codends made from netting turned 90 ° on the other hand brought a further improvement of the selectivity of such codends. Finally, the investigations on the Multipanel codend revealed the overwhelming influence of the square <b>mesh</b> <b>panels</b> on the selectivity success. If in a conventional diamond codend three windows are cut out starting 50 cm from the real end of the codend {{in such a way that}} the remaining parts have the same breadth as the square <b>mesh</b> <b>panels</b> to insert, the selective effect of such a codend is remarkably improved.

A sorting system incorporating a horizontal square <b>mesh</b> <b>panel</b> (150 mm bar length) dividing the trawl's body and extension sections into upper and lower compartments, leading aft to vertically-oriented trouser codends, was installed in a commercial roundfish trawl. First tests of the system, fishing around the clock, demonstrated approximately 90 % haddock separation in to the upper codend, 71 % cod separation in to the lower codend, and 72 % saithe separation into the upper codend.

40|$|Introduction: The article {{concerns}} {{occupational health}} and safety in agriculture of the Russian Federation. Among dangerous and harmful production factors in agriculture determining the injury rates and morbidity is negative impact of high levels of noise on workers. Prolonged exposure to noise leads to an increase in slow wave activity and changes in visual and auditory cortical response. Therefore, the improvement of conditions and labour protection in agriculture by reducing noise is an urgent task of our time. Materials and Methods: The authors’ assessment of the working conditions of employees of milk and meat processing industries showed that the noise level exceeds the standard values. There are some requirements for all the jobs. However, the development of noise-reducing structures demands frequency selective acoustic attenuation, based on the technological process. In the work, the author used methods based on features of the small reverberation chamber. Results: The authors proposed sound absorbent panels with high sanitary and hygienic properties: a biresonant honeycomb soundproof panel was developed for the dairy processing industry; an acoustic <b>mesh</b> <b>panel</b> was proposed for the meat processing lines. The sound absorption coefficient of the developed structures was evaluated by testing in a small reverberation chamber. Discussion and Conclusions: The article has an exploratory nature. The results of these studies graphically demonstrate the advantages of the proposed reduction of the noise level in agriculture...|$|E
40|$|Offshore {{pound net}} {{leaders in the}} {{southern}} portion of Chesapeake Bay in Virginia waters were documented to incidentally take protected loggerhead, Caretta caretta, and Kemp’s ridley, Lepidochelys kempii, sea turtles. Because of these losses, NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in 2004 closed the area to offshore pound net leaders annually from 6 May to 15 July and initiated a study of an experimental leader design that replaced the top two-thirds of the traditional <b>mesh</b> <b>panel</b> leader with vertical ropes (0. 95 cm) spaced 61 cm apart. This experimental leader was tested on four pound net sites {{on the eastern shore}} of Chesapeake Bay in 2004 and 2005. During the 2 trial periods, 21 loggerhead and Kemp’s ridley sea turtles were found interacting with the control leader and 1 leatherback turtle, Dermochelys coriacea, was found interacting with the experimental leader. Results of a negative binomial regression analysis comparing the two leader designs found the experimental leader significantly reduced sea turtle interactions (p= 0. 03). Finfish were sampled from the pound nets in the study to assess finfish catch performance differences between the two leader designs. Although the conclusions from this element of the experiment are not robust, paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed rank test results determined no significant harvest weight difference between the two leaders. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests did not reveal any substantive size selectivity differences between the two leaders...|$|E

In a total of 17 experimental hauls two nets were fished simultaneously, a conventional net on the starboard side and a net with a By-catch Reduction Panel inserted in the top sheet on the port side. The codend meshsize used was 80 mm. The main target species is plaice (Pleuronectes platessa L.). The By-catch Reduction Panel (BRP) tested was a square <b>mesh</b> <b>panel</b> with: 25 bars across and 22 bars deep of mesh size 150 mm, euroline™ single braid of 5 mm thickness. The panel was built in surrounding 80 mm netting and joined to 38 meshes in width and 19 meshes in depth in the port net of the twin-trawl, 12 meshes deep {{in front of the}} joining round of the codend. The panel reduced the by-catch of juvenile plaice by some 20 % compared to the conventional net, but there may be a loss of marketable plaice.

The resulting designs increase the specific power (W/kg) achievable in the near-term and are {{well suited to}} meet the demands of higher performance small satellites (smallsats). Advanced solar panel designs have been developed and demonstrated on two NASA SBIR contracts at Applied Solar. The first used 19 % efficient, large area (5. 5 cm x 6. 5 cm) GaAs/Ge solar cells with a lightweight rigid graphite epoxy isogrid substrate configuration. A 1, 445 cm(exp 2) coupon was fabricated and tested to demonstrate 60 W/kg with a high potential of achieving 80 W/kg. The second panel design used new 22 % efficiency, dual junction GaInP 2 /GaAs/Ge solar cells combined with a lightweight aluminum core/graphite fiber mesh facesheet substrate. A 1, 445 cm(exp 2) coupon was fabricated and tested to demonstrate 105 W/kg with the potential of achieving 115 W/kg.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} examining the risk of silica (7631869) dust exposure in mine workers exposed to continuous miners equipped with flooded bed scrubbers. Recent reductions in {{the density of the}} filter media in scrubber filter panels have suggested concomitant decreases in dust collection efficiencies and increases in the exposure levels of mine workers to respirable silica dust. A description of the structure and operation of continuous miners with flooded bed scrubbers was presented. The respirable silica collection efficiencies of wire mesh filter panels constructed using 10, 15, 20, or 30 layers of stainless steel wire mesh and of two synthetic filters were examined using both high and low capacity scrubbers with supplying air velocities of 2, 200 or 3, 500 feet per minute at the scrubber filter. The respective collection efficiencies of the 10 and 20 layer filters at the two air velocities were 58 % and 76 %, and 69 % and 84 %. The highest collection efficiencies were measured using the 30 layer wire filter and the two synthetic filter panels composed of nonwoven synthetic fiber and an array of nylon brushes. The relative overall performance of each type of scrubber was determined using data on the silica collection efficiency and the air moving capacity of each filter panel. The 30 layer wire <b>mesh</b> <b>panel</b> and the synthetic filters were the most effective in removing silica dust. Based on these findings, the 30 layer stainless steel wire mesh and the synthetic filter panels were recommended by NIOSH for use in flooded bed scrubbers to improve silica collection.
