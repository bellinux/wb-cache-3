40|$|Magnetic pumping in {{the solar}} corona is revisited. We derive {{conditions}} under which magnetic pumping can {{be the cause of}} heating of loops rather than of particle acceleration.

Efficient heating by pumping occurs since in these large loops the density is low enough that the proton-proton collision time is comparable to the periods of the external compressions.

40|$|Dissipation in {{granular}} high-temperature superconductors (HTSs) {{during the}} passage of macroscopic transport current j is mainly determined by carrier tunneling through intergrain boundaries (Josephson junctions). In the presence of external magnetic field H, {{it is necessary to}} take into account the significant <b>magnetic</b> flux <b>compression,</b> which can lead to the situation when the effective field Beff in the intergrain boundaries exceeds the external field by an order of magnitude. This is observed as a wide hysteresis of the field dependence of magnetoresistance R(H). In this study, we investigate the R(H) hysteresis evolution in granular 1 – 2 - 3 HTSs in different j–H orientations. The <b>magnetic</b> flux <b>compression</b> significantly affects the magnetoresistance and its hysteresis for both perpendicular (H ⊥ j) and parallel (H ǁ j) orientations.

For that purpose, an exhaustive computational MHD analysis is a necessary step. This master thesis investigated the possibility of using PLUTO to estimate the ideal-MHD of a multi-coil parabolic reaction chamber. PLUTO is a freely-distributed and modular code for computational astrophysics that, although not originally programmed for engineering applications, has demonstrated great adaptation capabilities: implementing the boundary conditions to effectively emulate a <b>magnetic</b> flux <b>compression</b> reaction chamber has eventually been possible. Besides, the attained results are in accordance with theoretical projections and previous numerical analyses. However, the outcomes pointed out that ideal-MHD could be an over-simplified model: relativistic conditions, that are not properly reproduced by the ideal-MHD equations, have been identified in several locations of the computational domain. In addition, some aspects of the real system physics have yet to be thoroughly investigated as well as mathematically described. Therefore, further investigations are required. According to this research, no other computational analyses of a multi-coil parabolic reaction chamber (i. e. the latest and most promising <b>magnetic</b> flux <b>compression</b> reaction chamber concept) have been found in the literature. Therefore, the results hereby reported contribute to the body of knowledge of plasma physics and nuclear fusion applied to space propulsion. SSESpace Systems EngineeringAerospace Engineerin...|$|R

For compression times shorter than the transit time of a compressional Alfven wave across the plasma slab, results show the formation of two counter-propagating shock waves, leading to a highly non-uniform plasma density profile.
