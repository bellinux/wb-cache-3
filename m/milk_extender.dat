For this purpose, semen from five Nili-Ravi buffalo bulls was collected and diluted at 37 oC with a final concentration of 10 x 106 motile spermatozoa per ml in skim <b>milk</b> <b>extender</b> containing 5 mM or 10 mM fructose or without fructose (control). The extended semen was cooled from 37 oC to 5 oC in 2 hours and stored at 5 °C for seven days. Sperm motility, in vitro longevity and plasma membrane integrity did not differ (P> 0. 05) in all three experimental extenders at 1 st day of storage. Sperm motility, in vitro longevity, plasma membrane integrity on 3 rd, 5 th and 7 th day of storage was significantly (P 0. 05) in all three experimental extenders upto seven days of storage at 5 oC. In conclusion, addition of 5 mM and 10 mM fructose in skim <b>milk</b> <b>extender</b> improved the preservability of buffalo bull semen stored at 5 oC...|$|E

40|$|Three {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to improve simple artificial insemination in sheep using chilled extended semen and evaluate methods to predict fertility in ewes. The first study evaluated the effect of semen extenders and storage temperature on motility parameters of ram semen stored for up to 72 h. Single semen collected from each ram was divided into four parts and extended using four extenders: milk, TRIS, TEST, and CJ- 2, diluted to 600 million sperm/ml and loaded into 0. 25 ml straws for storage at 4 and 15 ° C. Most of the CASA motility parameters were higher after extension and storage at 4 compared with 15 ° C (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Ram semen stored using milk or TRIS based extenders at 4 ° C maintained similar sperm motility parameters but both were higher compared with TEST or CJ- 2 extenders after storage for up to 3 d (P 3 ̆c 0. 05).

The Tris-glucose-citric acid buffer of a semen extender, which also included 20 % egg yolk, 5 % glycerol and 0. 25 % SDS, was replaced with 0, 50 or 100 % skimmed milk. After thawing, the proportion of motile spermatozoa was not significantly different among semen extenders during incubation for 120 min at 37 degrees C. At 120 min after thawing sperm viability was significantly greater when an extender in which the buffer had been completely replaced by milk was used than in an extender in which the buffer had been partially replaced (P < 0. 05). Acrosome morphology after thawing was similar for the three extenders tested. A considerable decrease in sperm motility and viability was observed during incubation, which may be due to concentrations of SDS that were not optimal.

40|$|Determination of an {{extender}} protocol {{which will}} enhance the viability of frozenthawed bovine spermatozoa will allow producers to obtain higher conception rates due to the increased survival rate of the spermatozoa. Ejaculates of six Brangus bulls (age= 18 months) were evaluated for spermatozoal motility, acrosomal integrity, and morphological characteristics (collectively called spermatozoal viability) in two experiments to test our hypotheses that (1) the treatment combination of a 4 hr cooling duration and a 2 hr equilibration with glycerol will result in optimum spermatozoal characteristics after freezing and thawing and (2) rank of three selected extenders relative to their effects on spermatozoal viability after freezing and thawing will be egg yolk-citrate (EC), egg yolk-tris (IMV), and skim milk (milk). In experiment 1, an ejaculate from each bull was partially extended and cooled to 4 ??C for either 2 or 4 hr and then allowed to equilibrate with the glycerolated extender for 2, 4, or 6 hr. Spermatozoal viability was assessed at 0, 3, 6, and 9 hr after thawing. In experiment 1, 4 hr of cooling resulted in {{a higher percentage of}} motile spermatozoa than did 2 hr of cooling. The 2 hr equilibration with glycerol yielded lower percentages of motile spermatozoa, acrosomal integrity, and morphologically normal spermatozoa than 4 and 6 hr equilibration durations with glycerol. In experiment 2, we observed a decrease in spermatozoal viability for all three extenders upon freezing and thawing. Viability of frozen-thawed spermatozoa extended in the milk was reduced for all incubation durations, and the IMV extender had a higher percentage of motile spermatozoa than the EC extender at 6 hr of incubation. A higher percentage of intact acrosomes was observed with the IMV extender; however, the EC extender had a higher percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa than the IMV extender. Our results indicate that at cooling duration of 4 hr and a 4 hr equilibration with glycerol provide the highest level of spermatozoal viability post-thaw of the treatments evaluated and that the IMV extender enhances the percentage of spermatozoa with an intact acrosome for frozenthawed spermatozoa over the EC and skim <b>milk</b> <b>extenders...</b>|$|R

40|$|M. Tech. AgricultureSouth African {{unimproved}} indigenous goats are disease tolerant, able {{to survive}} on harsh conditions such as extreme temperatures and poor vegetation. It is therefore, important to include this breed in breeding objectives during this time of climate change and when animals are resistant to antibiotics. However, these goats are under threat of extinction and very little information on their reproductive status is recognized. In order to improve or maintain South African unimproved indigenous goats, basic science concerning male fertility, semen quality and production should be investigated to conserve genetic materials for future breeding. Conflicting results have been reported concerning the effect of semen collection techniques on buck sperm quality. Longevity of sperm following semen collection is a major limitation to use fresh semen for artificial insemination in rural communities where majority of South African unimproved indigenous bucks are kept. Extenders such as Tris, egg yolk and cow skimmed milk {{have been used to}} prolong the survivability of buck sperm in other countries, but contradictory results have been reported concerning which extender is more suitable for buck semen.

The ejaculated (36) were diluted in ACP- 103 ® supplemented with different concentrations of egg yolk (0 %, 1 %, 3 %, 5 % and 7 %). The conservation occurred at 17 °C, and vigor and motility analysis were carried out daily. On days 1 (D 0), 3 (D 2) and 5 (D 4) the semen was evaluated for vitality, morphology and osmotic resistance. For statistical nonparametric analysis Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s tests were performed, and for parametric data ANOVA and Tukey test were used. A decrease in vigor and motility was observed in all treatments.

EquiPro TM has the same composition as EquiPro but is provided in a sterilized ready-to-use liquid form. AndroMed-E contains soybean lecithin as protein source. Semen was collected from seven stallions. Ejaculates were divided into three aliquots, diluted with the different extenders and stored at 5 °C for 4 days. Total motility, membrane integrity, average path velocity (VAP), curvilinear-velocity (VCL), straight-line velocity (VSL), distance average path (DAP), distance curved line (DCL) and distance straight line (DSL) were determined by computer-assisted analysis. Total motility decreased in all extenders during storage. The parameters VAP, VCL, VSL, DAP, DCL and DSL in semen diluted in EquiPro TM at most times and in semen diluted in AndroMed-E at some times were lower than in semen diluted in EquiPro (p < 0. 05).

Semen samples were collected from eight fertile stallions and stored for 96 h (day 0 ? 4) and assessed daily for motility, velocity and membrane integrity (viability) using a CASA system. Samples for bacteriology assessment were taken on day 2 of storage. No significant (p > 0. 05) differences in motility, velocity or viability were observed between treatments on days 0 ? 2. On days 3 and 4, semen stored without gentamicin at 5 degrees C had a significantly (p < 0. 05) better semen quality compared with storage at 15 degrees C without gentamicin, irrespective of oxygen exposure. On days 3 and 4, motility and velocity were greater in samples stored at 15 degrees C with gentamicin, compared with the corresponding treatments without antibiotic (p < 0. 05). This effect was also evident for viability on day 4. The decline in semen quality observed at 15 degrees C most likely resulted from the effect of bacterial growth. Bacterial growth was the greatest in samples stored at 15 degrees C without gentamicin, under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions (p < 0. 05). Bacterial growth was inhibited by adding of gentamicin at 15 degrees C, which accordingly reduced the decline in semen quality. Addition of antibiotic to samples stored at 5 degrees C had no significant effect on any parameter analysed.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of semen collection method (artificial vagina compared to electroejaculation), season in which the semen was collected (breeding season compared to non-breeding season), freezing extender (Biladyl ®, Andromed ® and skim <b>milk</b> based <b>extender)</b> and pre-treatment procedure (washing compared to non-washing) on post-thaw semen quality in buck. Ejaculates from seven bucks of the Blanca-Celtibérica breed were collected by artificial vagina and electroejaculation during the breeding (July to December) and non-breeding season (January to June). Samples were split in two aliquots and one of them was washed. Three freezing extenders were evaluated on washing and non-washing sperm samples. Ejaculates collected by artificial vagina had a greater sperm quality after thawing, with greater values (P≤ 0. 05) for SM (sperm motility), NAR (acrosome intact), YO-PRO- 1 -/PI- (intact spermatozoa), and Mitotracker+/YO-PRO- 1 - (spermatozoa with active mitochondria) and lower % DFI (DNA fragmentation index). Thawed sperm samples which were collected during the breeding season had greater values (P≤ 0. 05) for NAR, intact spermatozoa and spermatozoa with active mitochondria, than those semen samples obtained during the non-breeding season. Semen freezing with Biladyl ® and Andromed ® resulted in a greater sperm quality (P≤ 0. 05) after thawing in relation to milk-based extender. Washing procedure had no effect on sperm parameters assessed at thawing. Results from the present study suggest that the success of semen cryopreservation in Blanca-Celtibérica goat depends on semen collection method and season, as well as on the extender used. Thus, the post-thaw sperm quality will be greater (P≤ 0. 05) when samples are collected by artificial vagina during the breeding season and when Biladyl ® or Andromed ® are used as freezing extenders.

40|$|The {{composition}} of the extender in which semen is diluted before freezing {{plays a major role}} in successful cryopreservation of spermatozoa. This study was carried out to identify the suitable buffer for cryopreservation of buffalo semen. Sixteen split pooled ejaculates from two buffalo bulls possessing more than 70 % visual sperm motility, were diluted at 370 c either in lactose, skim <b>milk</b> or Tris <b>extenders.</b> The diluted semen was cooled to 40 c within 2 hours, equilibrated at 40 c for 4 - 6 hours following the addition of glycerol, filled in 0. 5 ml French straws and frozen in a programmable cell freezer before plunging into liquid nitrogen. Semen was thawed at 370 c for 30 seconds after 48 hours of storage inside liquid nitrogen. Post thaw visual sperm motility, plasma membrane integrity and acrosome morphology of each semen sample were assessed by warm plate microscopy at 370 c, hypo-osmotic swelling test (HOST) and giemsa staining, respectively. Analysis of variance revelated that percentage of post thaw visual sperm motility (Mean± standard deviation) tended to be higher in Tris (50 ± 3. 6) than skim milk (44. 5 ± 2. 5) and lower in lactose (24. 4 ± 10. 5) extenders (...|$|R
40|$|In this research, we {{compared}} the effect of three extenders for buck semen conservation; skimmed Milk (M), sodium Citrate (C) and a Tris-based diluent (T) and the washing of semen (removal of seminal plasma) on the in vitro viability of Murciano-Granadina goat spermatozoa stored at 5 C for 72 h. Motility, acrosome integrity and HOS test were evaluated to assess in vitro sperm viability. Milk diluent provided higher in vitro viability of spermatozoa than semen diluted in T during storage at 5 C. Motility in semen diluted in citrate and milk extenders was improved when semen was washed previously. In <b>milk</b> <b>extender,</b> membrane integrity (HOST) was also improved with the washing of semen. In conclusion, removal of seminal plasma could be necessary for successful chilled conservation of buck semen at 5 C when M or C based diluents is used.

40|$|A {{pilot project}} was {{initiated}} to introduce artificial insemination (AI) in goats at farmer level with chilled semen. Does (n= 18) were synchronized with progesterone impregnated vaginal sponges (60 mg Medroxyprogesterone acetate; MAP) for 11 days. At 48 hrs {{prior to removal}} of the sponges, intramuscular injection of 400 IU equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) and cloprostenol (0. 075 mg) was given. Fixed time vaginal insemination (43 - 45 hrs after sponge removal) was done twice (at 12 hrs interval) in 17 does with chilled Beetal buck semen (4 °C) extended with Tris-citric acid (TCA) or skimmed <b>milk</b> (SM) based <b>extender</b> (75 x 106 sperm/ml). Pregnancy test was performed at 45 days post insemination through ultrasonography.

This study was designed to investigate the cryoprotective effects of cholesterol incorporation into plasma membranes of equine spermatozoa using a novel method to alter membrane cholesterol content with a cholesterol-methyl-p-cyclodextrin complex. Experiment 1 was conducted to evaluate effects of four cholesterol concentrations (0. 0, 0. 125, 0. 25 or 0. 5 mM) five incubation times (0, 15, 30, 45 or 60 minutes), and two incubation temperatures (24 or 37 'C) on post-thaw computerized motility parameters. Two centrifugation media were used throughout the study: a non-fat skim <b>milk</b> glucose-sucrose <b>extender</b> (MK) and a modified Tyrode's medium (TALP). The MK media generally yielded better spermatozoal motility characteristics than TALP media. Cholesterol treatments tended to improve post-thaw motility over control media, with significant improvement in percent total motility with 0. 125 mM cholesterol (p 0. 05). Increasing incubation time tended to decrease percent spermatozoal motility. Incubation for 15 minutes tended to improve motility and preserved velocity parameters over longer incubation times. An incubation temperature of 24 'C also tended to increase motility parameters when compared to 37 'C. In Experiment 2, tritium-labeled cholesterol was utilized to verify spermatozoal incorporation of cholesterol in ejaculates of three stallions. Four different concentrations of tritiated cholesterol (0. 0, 0. 125, 0. 25 or 0. 50 mM) in MK or TALP media were used to evaluate effect of concentration on membrane uptake. There was significant (p< 0. 05) incorporation of cholesterol at all concentrations in both extenders when compared to the control. In Experiment 3, cryoprotective effects of cholesterol on spermatozoal plasma membranes were evaluated. Ejaculates from six stallions were cryopreserved to evaluate effect of centrifugation extender (MK or TALP) and added cholesterol (0. 125 mM) on post-thaw spermatozoal motility parameters and plasma membrane integrity. To evaluate membrane damage, spermatozoa were stained with carboxyfluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide fluorescent stains. Addition of cholesterol to either extender significantly improved (p < 0. 05) percentages of total, progressive and rapid spermatozoal motility in post-thaw samples. Cholesterol incorporation also significantly decreased the number of spermatozoa with post-thaw damage to the plasma membrane in MK (p< 0. 05) and TALP (p< 0. 06) media...|$|R
40|$|Equine semen are {{far less}} {{tolerant}} in the freezing and thawing process than bull semen. The stallion spermatozoa are known susceptible to cold-shock relating with {{the content of their}} fatty acid on the plasma membrane. The extender is one of determining factors in the success of stallion semen cryopreservation, as an energy source and protector the cell from harmfull effect of cold shock. The common cryoprotective agent (CPA) for mammalian spermatozoa was glycerol, but for stallion semen cryopreservation, dimethyl formamide (DMF) was more suitable. This research was conducted to compare the success of the stallion semen cryopreservation in skim milk and dimitropoulos (DV) extender with DMF as cryoprotectant. Semen from three sexualy mature stallions was collected twice a week using an artificial vagina. Semen was evaluated macro- and microscopically and then divided into two tubes, diluted each of them with skim <b>milk</b> dan DV <b>extender</b> (1 : 1), centrifuged at 3 000 rpm for 15 minutes. The supernatant was removed and the pellet (spermatozoa) was re-diluted in skim DMF (SDMF) and DVDMF extender with the concentration of spermatozoa was 200 x 106 ml- 1. The semen then packed in 0. 3 ml minitub straw equilibrated for two hours at 4 - 5 oC and frezee in liquid N 2 vapor for 10 minutes. The assessment of sperm quality was conducted based on the percentage of sperm motility and viability. In this research, post-thawed semen in DVDMF showed the percentages of the motility (36. 2 %) and the viability (59. 3 %) higher (P< 0. 05) than SDMF (28. 5 and 48. 0 %).

40|$|Fertilization and {{development}} of the preimplantation embryo is under genetic control. The present goal was to test 434 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for association with genetic variation in fertilization and early embryonic development. The approach was to produce embryos from 93 bulls using in vitro procedures (n 3 – 6 replicates per bull) and relate cleavage rate (CR) {{and development}} of cleaved embryos to the blastocyst stage (BDRC) to the genotype for each SNP. Bulls were selected to have either high or low estimates for predicted transmitted ability for daughter pregnancy rate (DPR), an estimate of female fertility. The repeatability was 0. 84 for CR and 0. 55 for BDRC. Semen extender affected CR, with lower results for <b>milk</b> <b>extender</b> than yolk extender. There was no significant correla-tion between DPR and either CR or BDRC. A total of 100 SNPs had a minor allele frequency sufficiently high (. 5 %) to allow association analysis.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to purify, identify, and {{characterize}} the component of goat bulbourethral gland secretion (BUS) re-sponsible for goat sperm deterioration in skim <b>milk</b> <b>extender.</b> BUS extracts promote {{a decrease in the}} percentage of motile spermatozoa, deterioration in the quality of movement, break-age of acrosomes, and cellular death of goat spermatozoa di-luted in skim milk. A 55 - to 60 -kDa monomeric glycoprotein(BUSgp 60 O) was purified by cation-exchange, concanavalin A, and heparin-affinity chromatography and was identified as the only BUS component responsible for the deterioration of sper-matozoa in milk. The BUSgp 60 O was shown to display triacylglyc-erol hydrolase activity, and partial sequences (37 amino acids in all) exhibited 50 - 70 % homology with sequences of various types of pancreatic lipases (PLs), especially PL-related protein 2 (PL-RP 2). In addition, porcine PL produced deterioration of goat sperm properties in milk as effectively as BUS and BUSgp 6 O. These results support the preliminary identification of the goat BUSgp 60 as a bulbourethral lipase belonging to the PL-RP 2 fam-ily. Since seminal plasma also contains factors favorable for sperm survival, it is envisaged that, for the best preservation of goat semen, specific inhibitors of this family of lipase could be added into milk-based extenders without eliminating seminal plasma...|$|E

40|$|Lower {{fertility}} of preserved stallion semen may {{be caused}} by damage to the spermatozoa or premature capacitation during storage. We investigated the use of the flavonoid, quercetin, with a standard skim <b>milk</b> <b>extender</b> for storage of stallion spermatozoa to prevent premature capacitation and acrosome reaction and to reduce the damage to spermatozoa from lipid peroxidation. Several concentrations of quercetin (0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 3 mM) were mixed with skim milk-glucose extender, and the antioxidant effectiveness was assessed using xanthine-xanthine oxidase challenge for 21 h. The effect of quercetin on capacitation status of sperm was assessed during a 4 h incubation at 33 C, and a storage trial at 5 C for 6 days. In addition, the ability of sperm stored in quercetin extender to undergo capacitation and acrosome reaction was assessed using heparin and A 23187. Lipid peroxidation in the sperm after challenge was inhibited by any concentration of quercetin in the medium, while 0. 1 and 0. 3 mM queicetin were most effective at preventing capacitation and acrosome reaction during a 33 C incubation. During storage at 5 degrees C for 6 d, quercetin addition to the extender significantly reduced the proportion of sperm capacitation. Heparin had no effect on capacitation status in either extender, but A 23187 increased the proportion of sperm stored in the quercetin extender undergoing capacitation and acrosome reaction. In conclusion, quercetin in the standard skim milk-glucose extender for equine semen during storage reduces lipid peroxidation of the sperm, maintains internal adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration, and prevents premature capacitation of sperm cells before insemination while still allowing the sperm to capacitate and acrosome react after insemination...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Fertility of frozen-thawed bull sperm {{is reduced}} by cryopreservation. Freezing-thawing {{procedures}} can result {{in as much as}} a sevenfold fertility decrease. Sperm mortality and loss of motility do not fully explain the reduced fertility of cryopreserved semen; they may be partially explained by the loss of sperm surface proteins, which are necessary for fertilization. We have previously identified P 25 b, a sperm surface protein, which is associated with the fertility index of bulls used for artificial insemination. Using Western blotting techniques, we have evaluated P 25 b levels before and after cryopreservation of bull spermatozoa in extenders based on either egg yolk or milk. Long storage periods (28 days) in liquid nitrogen results in a threefold decrease of P 25 b levels associated with cryopreserved versus fresh spermatozoa. Over a short storage period (3 – 7 days), a stable P 25 b level was observed on spermatozoa cryopreserved in extender containing either egg yolk or milk. A decrease in P 25 b levels associated with spermatozoa was observed after 5 days of storage in egg yolk extender, whereas a significant decrease was observed after 14 days of sperm storage in <b>milk</b> <b>extender</b> (P �. 05). Therefore, the loss of P 25 b may be responsible, at least in part, for the decrease in fertility following the freezing-thawing procedure of bull semen. Moreover, the cryopreservation extender used may have different effects on the loss of sperm surface proteins after even brief storage periods in liquid nitrogen. Considering that a sperm protein similar to P 25 b exists in humans (P 34 H), these results may have significant clinical applications in which frozen semen is used...|$|E
