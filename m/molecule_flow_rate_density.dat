The study covered {{the full extent of}} the transition regime between free-molecule and continuum flow, both in the upstream and downstream regions. Results for Mach number, number density, velocity and temperature are shown for three representative cases for a specified geometry with argon gas. The variation of <b>molecule</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> through the orifice and the variation of mass-thickness of the gas downstream of the orifice are given in the complete transition range. The <b>molecule</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> computed herewith show good agreement with previously published experimental measurements.
