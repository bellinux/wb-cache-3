40|$|This paper {{begins with}} an {{assumption}} that many UK manufacturing organizations are inherently wasteful, with complex production systems divorced from the core task of <b>adding</b> <b>value.</b> This waste {{can be regarded as}} untapped potential which exists throughout the total <b>value</b> <b>adding</b> chain.

In a first step, we estimate input-output matrices, at constant prices, that are used to calculate: i) the evolution of sectorial production costs; ii) an index of imported intermediate goods share in the productive process; and iii) an index of exporters' profitability. We assessed {{the evolution of the}}se indices. In a second step, we use a panel SYS-GMM to perform econometric tests based on data disaggregated by sectors of manufacturing. The panel regression results show that the index of imported intermediate goods and the share of <b>manufacturing</b> in <b>value</b> <b>added</b> are negatively correlated, in a statistically significant way. This result {{can be explained by the}} hypothesis that entrepreneurs adopt a strategy to reduce costs so as to preserve profitability, by increasing the share of imported intermediate goods in intermediate consumption when they become cheaper. For the exporters, this is a strategy to remain competitive in the manufacturing sector when the exchange rate appreciates. As a result of this process, and due to the results obtained in the tests, it is possible to state that a process similar to the maquilla may be occurring in the country. In the long run, growth and persistence of this fact may contribute to significant reductions in the share of <b>manufacturing</b> in <b>value</b> <b>added</b> of the Brazilian economy...|$|R

40|$|Until recently, the {{geographic}} element of concentrations {{of economic activity}} and knowledge spillovers was almost completely disregarded by economic theory. Although space is a central concept in theories {{in the field of}} geography, geographers have not attached great value to technology as a motivating factor for clustering of economic activity. A pooled market of skilled labour and the availability of nontraded inputs are considered much more important as factors that induce the clustering of firms (Krugman 1991). Several recent studies for the US (among others Jaffe, Trajtenberg and Henderson 1993, Audretsch and Feldman 1994, Feldman 1994) examined the extent to which innovative as well as economic activity clusters spatially.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} broad {{changes in}} the global structure of production {{in the last half}} century. The analysis is carried out along two dimensions: sectoral and geographical. A novelty of the paper is the use of sector-specific PPPs to estimate the structure of production in current PPP international dollars. The analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset that covers 140 countries (accounting for 98 % of global GDP in 2012) for the period 1960 - 2012. Salient findings of the paper include the following. First, in current prices there was a process of global de-industrialisation. The manufacturing share in global GDP dropped from more than 20 % in the early 1960 s to 12 % {{by the end of the}} period. This process, however, was not even across country-groups and regions. As expected, it was much more pronounced in the advanced economies. In developing countries there was an increase in the share of manufacturing, followed by a decline from the early 1990 s onwards. However, in constant prices, the share of manufacturing remained more or less constant. This implies that prices of services have been increasing much more rapidly than those of manufactured goods, probably due to slower productivity growth in services. In geographic terms, the share of developing countries in world <b>manufacturing</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> has increased from 25 % to more than 50 %. This phenomenon was clearly driven by the Asian developing economies. Finally, within manufacturing knowledge-intensive, high-tech industries and natural-resource intensive industries have increased their shares in global <b>manufacturing</b> <b>value</b> <b>added...</b>|$|E

Moving up the value chain or upgrading is the way forward for manufacturers in the future. By <b>manufacturing</b> higher <b>value</b> <b>added</b> products or more significant components, firms will position themselves at a higher tier position within the global value chains.

Overall, the results of our empirical analysis seem to render support to the hypothesis that FDI contribute to economic growth predominantly through knowledge spillovers, and that the higher level of technological development proxied by government and business R&D expenditures is associated with better growth performance among transition economies. Essentially, by the way we measure FDI in this analysis (i. e. the share of FDI in the <b>manufacturing</b> gross <b>value</b> <b>added)</b> and {{in the view of the}} integrated framework in which we study the relationship between FDI and economic growth, allows us to stipulate that the positive impact of FDI on economic growth is associated with more knowledge-capability and efficiency-seeking FDI...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This study {{seeks to}} analyse the {{relation}} between technology, competitiveness and specialisation in OECD manufacturing. Design/methodology/approach – A regression analysis is first performed explaining the disaggregate <b>manufacturing</b> relative <b>value</b> <b>added</b> market share performance {{of a series of}} OECD countries by their relative unit labour costs (ULC), relative own and foreign research intensity and by a catch up term. Estimates are then presented of equations relating an indicator of revealed comparative advantage of <b>value</b> <b>added</b> to similar measures of comparative performance of ULC, or of its component terms, and of R&D expenditure, and the respective results are considered in conjunction. Findings – The results show that, although each time there is evidence of a negative impact of the ULC-based variables, the influence of the technology variables is far more important. Re-estimation on research-intensive and less research-intensive samples shows that the dominance of the technology factors is especially important in the research-intensive industries. The influence of comparative wages on specialisation is, moreover, found to be positive here, suggesting the presence of a significant labour skill effect. Originality/value – The paper confirms the Schumpeterian insights, which have emphasised {{the relation between}} technology, competitiveness and specialisation.
