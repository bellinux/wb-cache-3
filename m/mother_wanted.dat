5|$|Always a tomboy, James quickly {{developed}} {{an interest in}} sports. Her godfather gave her a baseball bat and glove to celebrate her first holy communion. She excelled at hockey, baseball and synchronized swimming as a young child. Her <b>mother</b> <b>wanted</b> her to focus on swimming {{due to the lack}} of opportunities for girls in hockey in the 1970s. Her passion was for hockey, however, and she was constantly playing ball hockey with the neighbourhood boys from the time she was in kindergarten. James first played organized hockey in a Flemingdon Park boys house league at the age of eight, and then only after her mother threatened legal action as officials opposed her inclusion.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1911, a year before he was due to leave the school, Heseltine had tired of life at Eton. Without a clear plan for his future, he asked his mother if he could live abroad for a while. His <b>mother</b> <b>wanted</b> {{him to go to}} university, and then either into the City or the Civil Service, but she agreed to his request with the proviso that he would resume his {{education}} later. In October 1911 he proceeded to Cologne to learn German and to study piano at the conservatory. In Cologne Heseltine produced his first few songs which, like all his earliest works, were highly imitative of Delius. The piano studies went poorly, although Heseltine expanded his musical experiences by attending concerts and operas. He also experimented with general journalism, publishing an article in Railway and Travel Monthly on the subject of a disused Welsh branch line.|$|E
5|$|Rodham's <b>mother</b> <b>wanted</b> {{her to have}} an independent, {{professional}} career, and her father, who {{was otherwise}} a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender. Raised in a politically conservative household, Rodham helped canvass Chicago's South Side at age 13 following the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election, where she saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon. She then volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964. Rodham's early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.|$|E

Her will was contested by Marco Pio's sisters, who had been left nothing.|$|E
25|$|At {{about the}} age of 19, Augustine began an affair with a young woman in Carthage. Though his <b>mother</b> <b>wanted</b> him to marry a person of his class, the woman {{remained}} his lover for over fifteen years and gave birth to his son Adeodatus, who was viewed as extremely intelligent by his contemporaries. In 385, Augustine ended his relationship with his lover in order to prepare himself to marry a ten-year-old heiress. (He had to wait for two years because the legal age of marriage for women was twelve.) By the time he was able to marry her, however, he instead decided to become a celibate priest.|$|E
25|$|He {{started his}} studies {{in his home}} village and {{continued}} with secondary studies in Blaj and Sibiu. In 1830, his <b>mother</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to send him to}} study in Cluj and take the Philosophical courses at the Roman Catholic High School, however she could not get social help that would allow Ioan to receive free food and accommodation. Since Ioan Bran was a young boy and willing to study, he asked for help from his numerous relatives, some of whom were quite wealthy. This allowed him to start studying at law school in Cluj-Napoca. He later did his lawyer practice at the Court of Appeal of Târgu Mureș.|$|E

25|$|Richards {{was born}} at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in South Kensington, London. She was named Dakota Blue because her <b>mother</b> <b>wanted</b> a {{combination}} of a place and a colour. The family moved to Sussex where she attended Newlands School. At school, she took very few drama classes and she was not an active participant in class assemblies or school plays; she missed out on the part of Mary in the nativity play. Nonetheless, throughout primary school, she attended weekend drama classes and took time out of school to attend auditions. She finished at St Paul's Primary School, then began attending Blatchington Mill School in Hove and the K-Bis Theatre School.|$|E
25|$|With Muncie's father disabled, Muncie's mother led the {{household}} and ensured that her kids were educated. After seeing many of his relatives suffer from black lung disease and severe burns, Muncie {{had no desire to}} work in coal mines or the steel mills. He viewed athletics as his way out of Uniontown. In his sophomore year at Uniontown Area High School, Muncie played football. However, he quit playing after three games during his senior year when he suffered a concussion and his <b>mother</b> <b>wanted</b> him to stop playing. He turned to basketball, averaging 18 points per game for the Uniontown Red Raiders and earning an athletic scholarship to play basketball for Arizona Western Junior College (now Arizona Western College).|$|E
25|$|Manon {{was educated}} {{at home by}} Schulli and various tutors. Like her older half-sister, Anna Mahler, she was given piano lessons but did not {{distinguish}} herself as a musician. She attended the same progressive girls' school that her mother attended, , in Vienna's First District. However, Manon's irascible behavior, owing much to her free-spirited early childhood—Alma would let her go about naked ("stripped") as much as possible—Manon eventually left her boarding school and her education continued at home. Although {{she wanted to be}} an actress, her <b>mother</b> <b>wanted</b> her to have a practical education, too, and Manon, who had become fluent in French and Italian, prepared for the Austrian state exam as a language teacher and translator.|$|E

In 1947, he auditioned successfully for a piano scholarship to the Juilliard School of Music's Preparatory Division for Children, which he attended on Saturdays. His <b>mother</b> <b>wanted</b> him to become a renowned classical pianist like the contemporary of the day, Van Cliburn, but Sedaka was discovering pop music. When Sedaka was 13, a neighbor heard him playing and introduced him to her 16-year-old son, Howard Greenfield, an aspiring poet and lyricist. They became two of the legendary Brill Building's composers.|$|E
25|$|His <b>mother</b> <b>wanted</b> him and {{his younger}} brother Harry to have wider {{experiences}} than are usual for royal children.

Diana, who was by then divorced from Charles, died in a car accident {{in the early hours of}} 31 August 1997. William, then aged 15, along with his brother who was 12, and father, was staying at Balmoral Castle at the time. The Prince of Wales waited until his sons woke the following morning to tell them about their mother's death. At his mother's funeral, William accompanied his father, brother, paternal grandfather and maternal uncle in walking behind the funeral cortège from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} pursue more {{employment}} opportunities, Colbert and her family, including Marie and Emilie Loew, emigrated to Manhattan in 1906. They {{lived in a}} fifth-floor walk-up at 53rd Street. Colbert stated that climbing those stairs to the fifth floor every day until 1922 made her legs beautiful. Her parents formally changed her legal name to Lily Claudette Chauchoin. Georges Chauchoin worked as a minor official at First National City Bank. Before Colbert entered public school, she quickly learned English from her grandmother Marie Loew and remained fluent in French. She had hoped to become a painter ever since she had grasped her first pencil. Her family was naturalized in the U.S. in 1912. Her <b>mother</b> <b>wanted</b> to become an opera singer. After all, Jeanne joined two silent films Journey's End (1918) and The Poison Pen (1919) in supporting roles as Jeanne Loew.|$|E

25|$|William Lever {{was born}} on 19 September 1851 at 16 Wood Street, Bolton, Lancashire, England. He was the eldest son and the seventh child born to James Lever (1809–1897), a grocer, and Eliza Hesketh, {{daughter}} of a cotton mill manager. From age six to age nine William attended a small private school run by the Misses Aspinwall in a house on Wood Street, {{not far from the}} Lever family home. At the age of nine he was sent to another of Bolton's private schools before finishing his formal education at Bolton Church Institute from 1864 to 1867. Not a particularly bright scholar, he was nevertheless keen to acquire academic learning. His <b>mother</b> <b>wanted</b> him to enter the learned professions, ostensibly medicine, and William himself was very interested in becoming an architect. His father, however, had other, somewhat less erudite plans for his eldest son and thus, not long after his fifteenth birthday, he started work in the family grocery business. By then, the Lever family had moved from Wood Street to a larger house adjacent to the grocery business. In the celebrated Victorian manner, the boss’s son was, initially at least, shown no preferential treatment, being required to sweep the floor and tidy up before the staff arrived. Other tasks included various practical assignments {{more to do with the}} fundamentals of the wholesale grocery trade, almost certainly designed to prepare the youth for management in later years. His remuneration was “a shilling a week all found” which meant that his board and lodgings were provided, making the financial aspect of the contract more-or-less pocket money.|$|E

Her mother, who assumed regency, absolved the Polish noblemen from their oath {{of loyalty to}} Mary in favor of Mary's younger sister, Jadwiga, in early 1383. The idea of a female monarch {{remained}} unpopular among the Hungarian noblemen, the majority of whom regarded Mary's distant cousin, Charles III of Naples, as the lawful king. To strengthen Mary's position, the queen <b>mother</b> <b>wanted</b> her to marry Louis, the younger brother of Charles VI of France. Their engagement was announced in May 1385.|$|E
