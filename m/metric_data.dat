40|$|Range queries {{and range}} joins in metric spaces have {{applications}} in many areas, including GIS, computational biology, and <b>data</b> integration, where <b>metric</b> uncertain <b>data</b> exist in different forms, resulting from circumstances such as equipment limitations, high-throughput sequencing technologies, and privacy preservation. We represent <b>metric</b> uncertain <b>data</b> {{by using an}} object-level model and a bi-level model, respectively. Two novel indexes, the uncertain pivot B+-tree (UPB-tree) and the uncertain pivot B+-forest (UPB-forest), are proposed {{in order to support}} probabilistic range queries and range joins {{for a wide range of}} uncertain data types and similarity metrics. Both index structures use a small set of effective pivots chosen based on a newly defined criterion and employ the B+-tree(s) as the underlying index. In addition, we present efficient metric probabilistic range query and metric probabilistic range join algorithms, which utilize validation and pruning techniques based on derived probability lower and upper bounds. Extensive experiments with both real and synthetic data sets demonstrate that, compared against existing state-of-the-art indexes for <b>metric</b> uncertain <b>data,</b> the UPB-tree and the UPB-forest incur much lower construction costs, consume less storage space, and can support more efficient metric probabilistic range queries and metric probabilistic range joins...|$|R

40|$|In {{the area}} of {{software}} measurement, tool support/integration and automation are consid-ered key aspects of metric programs. While many tools exist to extract metrics from certain software artefacts, {{there is no single}} tool to cover <b>metric</b> <b>data</b> collection during the whole software process because of typically heterogeneous and ever-changing environments. To achieve full life-cycle coverage, instead of one tool a protocol is needed that allows metric tools to communicate and exchange data. This paper proposes a simple <b>metric</b> <b>data</b> exchange format and a data exchange protocol to communicate <b>metric</b> <b>data,</b> it defines re-sponsibilities of <b>metric</b> <b>data</b> sources and <b>metric</b> <b>data</b> repositories, and proposes a metric hub to enable interoperability. The data exchange format is implemented using XML and XML schema validation, the protocol is based on SOAP, and the hub consists of a Web service in-terface to the <b>metric</b> <b>data</b> repository. The proposed protocol and components, successfully applied to industry-projects in {{the area of}} management information systems, provide for a simple and lightweight way of data exchange in highly variable environments. 1...|$|E
40|$|<b>Metric</b> <b>data</b> {{structures}} (distance oracles, distance labeling schemes, routing schemes) and low-distortion embeddings {{provide a}} powerful algorithmic methodology, {{which has been}} successfully applied for ap-proximation algorithms [LLR 95], online algorithms [BBMN 11], distributed algorithms [KKM+ 12] and for computing sparsifiers [ST 04]. However, this methodology {{appears to have a}} limitation: the worst-case performance inherently depends on the cardinality of the metric, and one could not specify in advance which vertices/points should enjoy a better service (i. e., stretch/distortion, label size/dimension) than that given by the worst-case guarantee. In this paper we alleviate this limitation by devising a suit of prioritized <b>metric</b> <b>data</b> structures and embeddings. We show that given a priority ranking (x 1, x 2, [...] ., xn) of the graph vertices (respectively, metric points) one can devise a <b>metric</b> <b>data</b> structure (respectively, embedding) in which the stretch (resp., distortion) incurred by any pair containing a vertex xj will depend on the rank j of the vertex. We also show that other important parameters, such as the label size and (in some sense) the dimension, may depend only on j. In some of our <b>metric</b> <b>data</b> structures (resp., embeddings) we achieve both prioritized stretch (resp., distortion) and label size (resp., dimension) simultaneously. The worst-case performance of our <b>metric</b> <b>data</b> structures and embeddings is typically asymptotically no worse than of their non-prioritized counterparts. ...|$|E
