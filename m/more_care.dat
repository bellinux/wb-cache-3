5|$|A postwar {{review of}} {{inadequate}} housing {{led to the}} clearance and redevelopment of {{areas of the city}} in a postwar style, often at variance with the local Georgian style. In the 1950s the nearby villages of Combe Down, Twerton and Weston were incorporated into the city to enable the development of housing, much of it council housing. In the 1970s and 1980s it was recognised that conservation of historic buildings was inadequate, leading to <b>more</b> <b>care</b> and reuse of buildings and open spaces. In 1987 the city was selected by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, recognising its international cultural significance.|$|E
5|$|The {{dimensions}} of a Book of the Dead could vary widely; the longest is 40m long while some are {{as short as}} 1m. They are composed of sheets of papyrus joined together, the individual papyri varying in width from 15cm to 45cm. The scribes working on Book of the Dead papyri took <b>more</b> <b>care</b> over their work than those working on more mundane texts; care was taken to frame the text within margins, and to avoid writing on the joints between sheets. The words peret em heru, or 'coming forth by day' sometimes appear on the reverse of the outer margin, perhaps acting as a label.|$|E

5|$|The first {{enlisted men}} to be {{recruited}} in 1873 came {{from a wide variety}} of backgrounds, but most had some military experience. Many of the men enlisting in this tranche were later dismissed as unsuitable for service, less than half completing their term of enlistment, and <b>more</b> <b>care</b> was taken in later recruiting. Initially, a majority of the force were of Canadian origin but the number originating from Britain rose steadily during the 1880s until they made up over half of all new recruits, with British-born mounted police also tending to predominate in the non-commissioned cadre, mainly because they chose to stay longer in the force. Although the number of Canadian-born recruits increased for a while, the economic boom of the 1910s made the task much harder, and the mounted police opened a recruitment office in London; by 1914 almost 80 percent of the force had been born in Britain.|$|E

25|$|Given the {{increased}} internationalization of cuisines and food supply, foie gras is increasingly found in hot preparations {{not only in}} the United States, but in France and elsewhere. Duck foie gras ("foie gras de canard") has slightly lower fat content and is generally more suitable in texture to cooking at high temperature than is goose foie gras ("foie gras d'oie"), but chefs have been able to cook goose foie gras employing similar techniques developed for duck, albeit with <b>more</b> <b>care.</b>|$|E

It was then bought by an Indian businessman, Jitu Rivall who refurbished it as a 498 seat cinema. It was decided that the pock-marked ceiling was beyond economic repair and a new suspended ceiling was fitted. The premises were also equipped with a new sound system and huge new screen, brought forward of the original proscenium. The cinema re-opened on 31 October 1997 as the New Curzon Cinema, screening Indian Bollywood films.|$|E
25|$|Prince David, {{in company}} with Prince Henry, left Halifax on 12 January 1941 for work-ups off Bermuda. Crews of both ships {{were given a}} good {{introduction}} to the quick rolling characteristics of the 'Princes' during a stormy passage to Hamilton, Bermuda. Even as cruise ships, the three 'Princes' were known for their tendency to roll in heavy seas. As a gun platform, {{this was not an}} ideal trait and extra care and practice was needed to overcome the tendency to a quick rolling motion. Added to this was the age of the 6-inch guns themselves, which made it necessary to devote <b>more</b> <b>care</b> to the armament than was desirable in a hectic engagement.|$|E
25|$|Though it did {{represent}} {{a complex and}} gradual change in the shopping and self-presentation habits of both men and women, the idea of metrosexuality was often distilled in the media down to a few men and a short checklist of vanities, like skin care products, scented candles and costly, colorful dress shirts and pricey designer jeans. It was this image of the metrosexual—that of a straight young man who got pedicures and facials, practiced aromatherapy and spent freely on clothes—that contributed to a backlash against the term from men who merely wanted to feel free to take <b>more</b> <b>care</b> with their appearance than had been the norm in the 1990s, when companies abandoned dress codes, Dockers khakis became a popular brand, and XL, or extra-large, became the one size that fit all.|$|E

25|$|Another area {{of leisure}} {{activity}} on the Internet is multiplayer gaming. This form of recreation creates communities, where {{people of all ages}} and origins enjoy the fast-paced world of multiplayer games. These range from MMORPG to first-person shooters, from role-playing video games to online gambling. While online gaming has been around since the 1970s, modern modes of online gaming began with subscription services such as GameSpy and MPlayer. Non-subscribers were limited to certain types of game play or certain games. Many people use the Internet to access and download music, movies and other works for their enjoyment and relaxation. Free and fee-based services exist for all of these activities, using centralized servers and distributed peer-to-peer technologies. Some of these sources exercise <b>more</b> <b>care</b> with respect to the original artists' copyrights than others.|$|E
25|$|The Dallas Morning News unofficially {{reported}} that arrests for Cheese in DISD decreased. The district performed 71 arrests for Cheese in the 2006-2007 school year. During the 2007-2008 school year from August to December the district performed 17 arrests. The {{number of children}} seeking treatment for use of Cheese remained steady. The paper {{reported that}} usage of Cheese spread from the northwest Dallas area and into areas outside of Dallas County. Deputy Chief Julian Bernal, {{the commander of the}} narcotics division of the Dallas Police, said that he encountered more White and Black teenagers using the drug. Michelle Hemm, the director of the Phoenix Academy of Dallas, believes that Cheese arrests decreased because users took <b>more</b> <b>care</b> to conceal the drugs or did not bring the drugs to schools for fear of detection.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, {{while the}} {{preservation}} of historic shophouses have suffered substantially in heavily developed states like Kuala Lumpur, Johor, Perak, Negeri Sembilan and Selangor, shophouses in Penang and Malacca (which state capitals, George Town and Malacca Town, have been gazetted as UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 2008) received <b>more</b> <b>care</b> and attention due to emerging historical preservation movements in both states, experiencing similar levels of rejuvenations as in Singapore. However, the gentrification of both cities has led to older tenants of shophouses driven out by the rising costs of renting or buying properties within historical districts. In 2012, the cost of buying a pre-World War II shophouse in George Town reached RM2,000 per square foot (US$660), equivalent {{to the price of}} the most expensive Kuala Lumpur city centre condominium units.|$|E

25|$|V. moorii shows social but not genetic monogamy. Breeding adults spawn {{according}} to the lunar cycle and thus spawn synchronously (see Lunar synchronicity in spawning). This allows males to spawn on eggs that {{do not belong to}} the female he is mated to (also known as parasitic spawning). All offspring within a single brood share the same mother but not the same father. A study found that broods are almost always sired by multiple males (at least two but sometimes more than ten), a rate which is exceptionally high compared to other multiply mating fish. The male mated to the mother of the brood will invest significant resources to protect the territory and brood even though he did not sire the majority of the fry. The female is related to the entire brood and the male is related only to a fraction of the brood, so the female would be expected to provide <b>more</b> <b>care</b> than the male. However, there is no great difference in male parental care and female parental care.|$|E
25|$|In {{a number}} of cases, Mackworth was closely {{involved}} in moves to move aside opponents of the régime, who came from diverse standpoints and were treated in often very different ways. On 8 March {{he was one of}} a committee of three deputed to examine the case of the Levellers' leader John Lilburne, detained by the government the previous year, although acquitted of all charges. Eight days later they recommended he be sent to Mount Orgueil Castle on Jersey. On 23 March he was put on a committee to investigate the dispute between Elizabeth, Countess Dirletoun, and a group of improvers concerned {{in the construction of the}} River Wey Navigation, headed by James Pitson. Lady Elizabeth was the widow of William Hamilton, 2nd Duke of Hamilton, who was killed at the Battle of Worcester. She had refused the compensation offered by the developers for building on her land and had been breaking down the banks of the river, finally demolishing a building that had been in use as a government powder magazine, claiming that she feared for the lives of her family. As the scheme had been approved by Parliament and was clearly in the interests of trade, there was little chance that objectors would prevail, but the committee's recommendations were moderate. Pitson was granted an order protecting his investment and requesting the county authorities take <b>more</b> <b>care</b> to keep the peace. However, as Lady Dirlestoun would not accept £200, he was to pay her £10 10s. a year and then buy the land off her heirs. More generally, Mackworth was deputed to {{a number of}} committees dealing with censorship.|$|E
500|$|Any {{continuous}} mapping from {{a circle}} to an ordinary sphere can be continuously deformed to a one-point mapping, and so its homotopy class is trivial. One way to visualize {{this is to}} imagine a rubber-band wrapped around a frictionless ball: the band can always be slid off the ball. The homotopy group is therefore a trivial group, with only one element, the identity element, and {{so it can be}} identified with the subgroup of Z consisting only of the number zero.
