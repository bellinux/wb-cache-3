5|$|In February 1959, Hawker had {{completed}} practically {{all of the}} design work and thus passed the entirety of its manufacturing design work to the company's Experimental Design Office at Kingston, London. In April 1959, the Ministry of Supply formally issued a contract for {{the completion of a}} pair of P.1127 prototypes. However, there were critics amongst the Air Staff of the project, typically disliking the P.1127 for its subsonic speeds, favouring supersonic-capable aircraft instead; Mason attributes this as having caused considerable delay in the issuing of a contract to Hawker. On 23 July 1959, Hawker authorised the application of <b>maximum</b> <b>effort</b> to complete the development of the P.1127.|$|E
5|$|As the French {{constructed}} further fortifications, Luftwaffe {{reconnaissance aircraft}} {{picked up the}} activity and reported it. The steep slopes {{on the banks of}} the Meuse, added to what appeared in photographic reconnaissance to be a formidable barrier of bunkers and defence lines, caused Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, the commander in chief of Army Group A, to question the wisdom of Guderian in choosing Sedan as the point of <b>maximum</b> <b>effort.</b> To identify how strong these fortifications were, a team of photographic specialists were called in to evaluate the pictures. Their analysis concluded that what appeared to be strong fortified positions were just the construction sites of half-built bunkers that were, to all intents and purposes, empty shells. The contribution of the specialists tilted the Sedan attack plan into Guderian's favour.|$|E
5|$|For the German summer offensive, Fall Blau, the Luftwaffe had {{concentrated}} 1,800 aircraft into Luftflotte 4 {{making it}} {{the largest and most}} powerful air command in the world. The Stukawaffe strength stood at 151. During the Battle of Stalingrad, Stukas flew thousands of sorties against Soviet positions in the city. StG 1, 2 and 77 flew 320 sorties on 14 October 1942. As the German Sixth Army pushed the Soviets into a 1,000 metre enclave on {{the west bank of the}} Volga River, 1,208 Stuka sorties were flown against this small strip of land. The intense air attack, though causing horrific losses on Soviet units, failed to destroy them. The Luftwaffe's Stuka force made a <b>maximum</b> <b>effort</b> during this phase of the war. They flew an average of 500 sorties per day and caused heavy losses among Soviet forces, losing an average of only one Stuka per day. The Battle of Stalingrad marked the high point in the fortunes of the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka. As the strength of the Soviet Air Forces grew, they gradually wrested control of the skies from the Luftwaffe. From this point onward, Stuka losses increased.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 13 May, the 10th Panzer Division slipped into {{position}} upstream to the north-east of Sedan, ready to strike at its designated crossing point near the town of Wadelincourt. Downstream, the 2nd Panzer Division moved into position to cross at Donchery. The 1st Panzer Division prepared to strike at the Gaulier bridgehead, in the centre of Sedan's tactical front. It was on the northern bend of the Sedan Meuse loop that the Luftwaffe was to make its <b>maximum</b> <b>effort,</b> between Gaulier and Wadelincourt. To supplement his air support, Guderian stripped most of his Panzer Divisions of their artillery, which he then positioned directly opposite Gaulier. However, the artillery regiments lacked ammunition. Sustained and damaging bombardment through shelling was impossible. The Luftwaffe {{was going to have to}} do most of the work. Guderian reported that his Corps had only 141 artillery pieces against the French 174. To the north and south of Sedan, the French X Corps and French XXXXI Corps (at the artillery fortress at Charleville-Mézières) could also add their artillery and shell Guderian's Panzer units as they crossed the bridgeheads. The slow advance of artillery units to the front added to the German numerical inferiority, which was now 1:3 against. Only in the afternoon did the German artillery make an appearance, but with little effect. The 2nd Panzer Division was forced to attack without artillery support. For these reasons, Guderian had decided the outcome depended on the quality of air support, acting as flying artillery.|$|E
5|$|The Australian-led INTERFET {{intervention}} into East Timor in September 1999 {{marked the}} closest Australia's F-111s came to combat. F-111s from both No. 1 and No. 6 Squadrons were deployed to RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory, on 28 August {{to support the}} international forces, and remained there until 17 December 1999. This was a <b>maximum</b> <b>effort</b> for No. 82 Wing, and up to 10 F-111Cs were available at Tindal; No. 1 Squadron's commitment peaked at six aircraft and about 100 personnel. No. 75 Squadron also maintained 12 F/A-18s at its home base of Tindal to support INTERFET if needed. From 20 September, when INTERFET began to arrive in East Timor, the F-111s were maintained {{at a high level}} of readiness to conduct reconnaissance flights or air strikes if the situation deteriorated. For the latter role two F-111s armed with concrete-filled bombs fitted with precision guidance kits were kept available at all times. INTERFET did not encounter significant resistance, however, and F-111 operations were limited to reconnaissance missions conducted by RF-111Cs from 5 November. Each of these sorties were made after gaining approval from the Indonesian government and normally focused on bridges and communications installations. The last RF-111C flight over East Timor took place on 9 December. War games had the F-111s achieving complete success if a strike was necessary against Indonesian military headquarters near the capital.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the reliability of surface electromyography of the masticatory muscles in patients with cerebral palsy. MethodsSurface electromyography was performed over the masseter and temporal muscles in 15 patients with cerebral palsy with the mandible at rest and during <b>maximum</b> clenching <b>effort</b> in two sessions. The data were analyzed using the root mean square amplitude, mean frequency, median frequency, zero crossings and approximate entropy. ResultsIn the within-day evaluations, intraclass correlation coefficients were higher (0. 80 – 0. 98) for the all electromyography variables and muscles during <b>maximum</b> clenching <b>effort.</b> In the resting position, the coefficients revealed good to excellent reliability (0. 61 – 0. 95) for root mean square, mean frequency, median frequency and zero crossings and fair to good reliability (0. 53 – 0. 74) for approximate entropy. In the between-day evaluations, the coefficients revealed good to excellent reliability (0. 60 – 0. 86) for mean frequency, median frequency, zero crossings and approximate entropy. In the resting position, the coefficients revealed poor to fair reliability (0. 23 – 0. 57) for all electromyography variables studied. The root mean square had the highest standard errors during <b>maximum</b> clenching <b>effort</b> (2. 37 – 5. 91) and at rest (1. 47 – 6. 86). ConclusionMean frequency, median frequency and approximate entropy are the most reliable variables of surface electromyography signals of the masseter and temporal muscles during <b>maximum</b> clenching <b>effort</b> in individuals with cerebral palsy. These measures can be used to evaluate the function and behaviour of the masticatory muscles in this population following oral rehabilitation and surgical oral procedures as well as for the study the physiology of these muscles...|$|R
