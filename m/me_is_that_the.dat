500|$|Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani {{said that}} Black Lives Matter is [...] "inherently racist" [...] {{and called the}} {{movement}} anti-American. According to Giuliani, the BLM movement divides people and exacerbates racial tensions. Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza replied, [...] "What those comments show <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> former mayor doesn't understand racism," [...] adding that his comments were [...] "not rooted in fact." [...] Washington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart wrote that Giuliani's comments reinforced his sense that the former mayor lives in a [...] "racial world of make-believe".|$|E

In the NHS, the system is so battered and poorly run that unless you are really lucky, you will fall through the cracks. The NHS is, however, astonishingly good at critical care. But what testicular cancer taught <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> NHS will probably let you down if you need screening, fast diagnosis and an operation at a time that suits you". He supports reform within the NHS, saying that its resources have become stretched due to increased immigration, and blaming Labour for high costs of new hospitals built through private finance initiatives.|$|E
2500|$|In his {{entry for}} November 27, 1935, Sebastian concludes: [...] "I am {{waiting for the}} day when [...] make their peace with Sandu Tudor [...] and {{discover}} that the Jews are alone responsible for the quarrel—especially myself, who has aroused discord among the Christian fraternity. It sounds like a joke, but it's plausible enough." [...] Almost a year later, when Credința focused its attack on Sebastian, the latter noted: [...] "The only thing that surprises <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> attack came so late." [...] Tudor and Stancu were defeated in court, and were obliged to formally recant. Ornea, who writes that Credința only published the verdict with much reluctance and discretion ("somewhere deep in the pages of one issue"), concludes that the scandal was a decisive blow for Criterion, causing Eliade's club to dissolve itself.|$|E

Their treatment of the topic has been comprehensive, impartial and professional. The main message to emerge from their paper, for <b>me,</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fiscal retrenchment and economic growth of the period did not have any particularly adverse distributional consequences ? at a macroeconomic level at least. This is in marked contrast to the experience of the UK {{in the first half of}} the 1980 s, where the income share of the bottom 50 per cent fell quite considerably over the period. The main reason for this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> fiscal adjustment in Ireland was accompanied by growth in incomes and employment, thereby avoiding many of the adverse distributional consequences experienced in the UK...|$|R

[...] As noted above, as a soldier, Vonnegut was captured by Germans at the Battle of the Bulge and transported to Dresden. He and fellow prisoners survived the bombing while being held in a deep cellar of Schlachthof Fünf (Slaughterhouse 5). The narrator begins the story describing his connection to the fire-bombing of Dresden and his reasons for writing Slaughterhouse-Five.|$|R

2500|$|At the 2012 Game Developers Conference, the CEO of CD Projekt Red, Marcin Iwinski, {{announced}} that the company will not use DRM in any of its future releases. Iwinski stated of DRM, [...] "it's just over-complicating things. We release the game. It's cracked in two hours, it {{was no time for}} [...] What really surprised <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pirates didn't use the GOG version, which was not protected. They took the SecuROM retail version, cracked it and said 'we cracked it' – meanwhile there's a non-secure version with a simultaneous release. You'd think the GOG version would be the one floating around." [...] Iwinski added after the presentation, [...] "DRM does not protect your game. If there are examples that it does, then people maybe should consider it, but then there are complications with legit users." ...|$|E
2500|$|After his resignation, {{from his}} post as Commissioner of the Food and Drugs Administration in December 1969, Dr. Herbert L. Ley, Jr. [...] In an {{interview}} to the New York Times, warned {{the public about the}} FDA’s inability to safeguard consumers. People were being misled, he believed “The thing [...] that bugs <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> people think the FDA is protecting them - it isn’t. What the FDA is doing and what the public thinks it’s doing are as different as night and day,” he said. The agency, in his opinion, did not have the motivation to protect consumers, faced budget shortfalls, and lacked support from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Dr. Ley was critical of Congress, the Administration and the drug industry, he stated that he had [...] "constant, tremendous, sometimes unmerciful pressure" [...] from the drug industry and that the drug company lobbyists, combined with the politicians who worked on behalf of their patrons, could bring “tremendous pressure” to bear on him and his staff, to try preventing FDA restrictions on their drugs. The interview concluded with Ley stating that the entire issue was about money, “pure and simple”. On December 15, 1999, interviewed for the oral history program of the FDA History Office, Dr. Ley shared that from the first controversy in his tenure as FDA Commissioner he had a [...] "gut feeling" [...] that his life expectancy at the FDA was probably limited. He said he had done everything by the book, both in the FDA and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and he thinks that what the Administration was really wishing, was that he would stonewall the whole Academy report, because it was goring too many pharmaceutical companies.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to obtaining {{his record}} deal, Mika sent demos to many record {{companies}} in Britain, but was never signed. One record label in particular claimed that Mika {{had a good}} voice, but insisted he write more conventional songs like Robbie Williams {{in order to become}} more commercial. Mika rejected this advice. [...] The song [...] "Grace Kelly" [...] was inspired by these problems. In 2006 Mika signed with Island Records and began recording his debut album. His musical influences are based in classical music. Before Mika released his debut album he promised the media that [...] "It was a magical world that you could live in. A parallel universe for people that is illusory and enchanting and amazing." [...] Some songs on the album are sexually ambiguous, prompting some questioning regarding Mika's sexuality. On this, Mika comments that he has no taboos about what he can use to tell a story or what stories he can actually tell. He believes that sexualizing music is great, but politically sexualizing music and making the artist's sexuality the defining point of someone's music is [...] "boring". He says about his own sexuality: [...] "...laying myself out on the table to almost a tabloid level and kind of sharing my entire personal life, I'm really not into that." [...] The songs on the album have different subjects. [...] "Grace Kelly", as stated before, is about the struggle of getting a record deal. Mika stated that the song is a very important song on the album mostly because:"...it's a flagpole for the record in terms of lyrical content and the whole pop vision I wanted to get across." [...] The cover for the album and booklet was designed by Mika's sister, Yasmine, who works under the pen name DaWack, Richard Hogg and Mika himself. In March 2007 the album was released in the United States. Before its release there was much publicity about the album, mainly due to its success in Europe. Mika commented on the hype by saying: [...] "I think I'm lucky. Hype can be good and hype can be bad. The good thing that's happening to <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hype is about the project, it's about the music ... I'm not the son of anyone famous, I haven't really slept with anyone particularly well known ... it's really just about music, and that's something I think is very healthy." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{past week}} I {{had the good}} fortune to read an {{advanced}} copy of a powerful book Fault Line by my good friend Christa Desir. Fault line tells a story about a young woman who was raped and how that act of violence shatters her and how that shattering reverberates among the people who care about her. I’m not going to give the whole story away now (it goes on sale on October 15 th (you can purchase it here), however I want to say two things about it. First this book really shook me. I want you all to get it because this is the kind of book that makes you want to talk to people you love after reading it. It is a difficult book to read, but then again many important things are often difficult. The second aspect of <b>the</b> book <b>that</b> struck <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> woman who <b>was</b> raped went into a spiral of self-destructive behavior because she wanted to be able to feel something, even if <b>that</b> something <b>was</b> negative. She did not seek help because of multiple reasons and that ultimately lead to some difficult situations. Seeking help is important and we should be working as a society to lower barriers for victims of sexual assault to get that help...|$|R

The author later appears as a sick fellow prisoner in Billy Pilgrim's World War II. The Narrator notes this saying: [...] "That <b>was</b> I. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>me.</b> <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> author of this book." [...] The story repeatedly refers to real and fictional novels and fiction; Billy reads Valley of the Dolls (1966), skims a Tralfamadorian novel, and participates in a radio talk show, part of a literary-expert panel discussing [...] "The Death of the Novel."
