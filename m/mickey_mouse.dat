Perhaps as contemporary spectators {{we are no longer}} used to <b>Mickey</b> <b>Mousing</b> in films (its use radically diminished in the fifties and after). Still, the practice of catching every moment with music has a visual equivalent, and <b>Mickey</b> <b>Mousing</b> has been made to bear the brunt of the criticism for an overobnoxiousness that it only partially creates." ...|$|R

5|$|Disney {{settled on}} the film's concept as work neared {{completion}} on The Sorcerer's Apprentice, an elaborate Silly Symphonies short designed as a comeback role for <b>Mickey</b> <b>Mouse,</b> who had declined in popularity.

The soundtrack was recorded using multiple audio channels and reproduced with Fantasound, a pioneering sound reproduction system that made Fantasia the first commercial film shown in stereophonic sound.|$|E

In 1941, Glenn T.
