5|$|In {{the realm}} of cartography, there were further {{advances}} beyond the map-makers of the Han dynasty. When the Tang chancellor Pei Ju (547–627) {{was working for the}} Sui dynasty as a Commercial Commissioner in 605, he created a well-known gridded map with a graduated scale in the tradition of Pei Xiu (224–271). The Tang chancellor Xu Jingzong (592–672) was also known for his map of China drawn in the year 658. In the year 785 the Emperor Dezong had the geographer and cartographer Jia Dan (730–805) complete a map of China and her former colonies in Central Asia. Upon its completion in 801, the map was 9.1m (30ft) in length and 10m (33ft) in height, mapped out on a grid scale of one inch equaling one hundred li (Chinese unit of <b>measuring</b> <b>distance).</b> A Chinese map of 1137 is similar in complexity to the one made by Jia Dan, carved on a stone stele with a grid scale of 100 li. However, the only type of map that has survived from the Tang period are star charts. Despite this, the earliest extant terrain maps of China come from the ancient State of Qin; maps from the 4th century BC that were excavated in 1986.|$|E

25|$|A serious {{difficulty}} arises if the variables are not {{measured in the}} same units. First consider <b>measuring</b> <b>distance</b> between a data point and the curve – what are the measurement units for this distance? If we consider <b>measuring</b> <b>distance</b> based on Pythagoras' Theorem then {{it is clear that}} we shall be adding quantities measured in different units, and so this leads to meaningless results. Secondly, if we rescale one of the variables e.g., measure in grams rather than kilograms, then we shall end up with different results (a different curve). To avoid this problem of incommensurability it is sometimes suggested that we convert to dimensionless variables—this may be called normalization or standardization. However there are various ways of doing this, and these lead to fitted models which are not equivalent to each other. One approach is to normalize by known (or estimated) measurement precision thereby minimizing the Mahalanobis distance from the points to the line, providing a maximum-likelihood solution; the unknown precisions could be found via analysis of variance.|$|E

25|$|Speed is {{the change}} in {{distance}} to an object with respect to time. Thus the existing system for <b>measuring</b> <b>distance,</b> combined with a memory capacity {{to see where the}} target last was, is enough to measure speed. At one time the memory consisted of a user making grease pencil marks on the radar screen and then calculating the speed using a slide rule. Modern radar systems perform the equivalent operation faster and more accurately using computers.|$|E
25|$|Trail {{can vary}} as the bike leans or steers. In {{the case of}} {{traditional}} geometry, trail decreases (and wheelbase increases if <b>measuring</b> <b>distance</b> between ground contact points and not hubs) as the bike leans and steers {{in the direction of}} the lean. Trail can also vary as the suspension activates, in response to braking for example. As telescopic forks compress due to load transfer during braking, the trail and the wheelbase both decrease. At least one motorcycle, the MotoCzysz C1, has a fork with adjustable trail, from 89mm to 101mm.|$|E
25|$|In {{the year}} 267,Pei Xiu (224271) was {{appointed}} as the Minister of Works by Emperor Wu of Jin, the first emperor of the Jin Dynasty. Pei {{is best known}} for his work in cartography. Although map making and use of the grid existed in China before him, he was the first to mention a plotted geometrical grid and graduated scale displayed on the surface of maps to gain greater accuracy in the estimated distance between different locations. Pei outlined six principles that should be observed when creating maps, two of which included the rectangular grid and the graduated scale for <b>measuring</b> <b>distance.</b> Historians compare him to the Greek Ptolemy for his contributions in cartography. However, Howard Nelson states that, although the accounts of earlier cartographic works by the inventor and official Zhang Heng (78139) are somewhat vague and sketchy, there is ample written evidence that Pei Xiu derived the use of the rectangular grid reference from the maps of Zhang Heng.|$|E

500|$|Supernovae {{in other}} galaxies cannot be {{predicted}} with any meaningful accuracy. Normally, {{when they are}} discovered, they are already in progress. [...] Most scientific interest in supernovae—as standard candles for <b>measuring</b> <b>distance,</b> for example—require an observation of their peak luminosity.

30|$|In {{the vast}} {{majority}} of studies, it is assumed that errors in the <b>measured</b> <b>distance</b> are caused by zero-mean white Gaussian noise. In this case, the LS algorithm and EKF gives the optimal solution[10]. However, in actual situations, the <b>measured</b> <b>distances</b> are not only corrupted by noise but also deteriorated by bias, which is caused by non-line-of-sight and multiple paths of ranging signal[11]. When only zero-mean noise is added to the <b>measured</b> <b>distance,</b> the expected value of the <b>measured</b> <b>distance</b> is equal to the true distance. On the other hand, when bias exists, the expected value will not be equal to the true distance. The combination of noise and bias can be regarded as nonzero mean noise with unknown mean value. Therefore, the bias can result in errors, even if the LS algorithm and EKF are used.|$|R
