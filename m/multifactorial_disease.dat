40|$|The {{risk for}} <b>multifactorial</b> <b>diseases</b> is {{determined}} by risk factors that frequently apply across disorders (universal risk factors). To investigate unresolved issues on etiology of and individual's susceptibility to <b>multifactorial</b> <b>diseases,</b> research focus should shift from single determinant-outcome relations to effect modification of universal risk factors. We present a model to investigate universal risk factors of <b>multifactorial</b> <b>diseases,</b> based on a single risk factor, a single outcome measure, and several effect modifiers. Outcome measures can be disease overriding, such as clustering of disease, frailty and quality of life. "Life course epidemiology" {{can be considered as}} a specific application of the proposed model, since risk factors and effect modifiers of <b>multifactorial</b> <b>diseases</b> typically have a chronic aspect. Risk factors are categorized into genetic, environmental, or complex factors, the latter resulting from interactions between (multiple) genetic and environmental factors (an example of a complex factor is overweight). The proposed research model of <b>multifactorial</b> <b>diseases</b> assumes that determinant-outcome relations differ between individuals because of modifiers, which can be divided into three categories. First, risk-factor modifiers that determine the effect of the determinant (such as factors that modify gene-expression in case of a genetic determinant). Second, outcome modifiers that determine the expression of the studied outcome (such as medication use). Third, generic modifiers that determine the susceptibility for <b>multifactorial</b> <b>diseases</b> (such as age). A study to assess disease risk during life requires phenotype and outcome measurements in multiple generations with a long-term follow up. Multiple generations will also enable to separate genetic and environmental factors. Traditionally, representative individuals (probands) and their first-degree relatives have been included in this type of research. We put forward that a three-generation design is the optimal approach to investigate <b>multifactorial</b> <b>diseases.</b> This design has statistical advantages (precision, multiple-informants, separation of non-genetic and genetic familial transmission, direct haplotype assessment, quantify genetic effects), enables unique possibilities to study social characteristics (socioeconomic mobility, partner preferences, between-generation similarities), and offers practical benefits (efficiency, lower non-response). LifeLines is a study based on these concepts. It will be carried out in a representative sample of 165, 000 participants from the northern provinces of the Netherlands. LifeLines will contribute to the understanding of how universal risk factors are modified to influence the individual susceptibility to <b>multifactorial</b> <b>diseases,</b> not only at one stage of life but cumulatively over time: the lifeline...|$|R

The mutated DNA effects genes involved with the cell cycle, classified as either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Oncogenes are responsible for cell proliferation and differentiation. Oncogenes responsible for cell growth are overexpressed in cancerous cells. Tumor suppressor genes prevent cells with erroneous cell cycles from replicating. Cancer cells ignore cell cycle regulators that control cell growth, division, and death.|$|E

Tumour-specific vectors are being developed by modification of the vector and/or inclusion of a tissue specific promoter. Investigations employ various animal models of disease (see also the Transgene Technology platform of the Groningen Genomics Centre for available models).

40|$|Inflammation is classically {{recognized}} as an essential step for the control of microbial invasion or tissue injury {{as well as for}} the maintenance of tissue homeostasis under a variety of noxious conditions. One of the most intriguing aspect of studying inflammation is the plurality of the inflammatory mediators that are continuously discovered (microRNAs, adipokines, inflammasomes and the danger signals, etc.) and their effects on target tissues. Several studies have demonstrated that inflammatory response represents the "common soil" of the <b>multifactorial</b> <b>diseases,</b> encompassing both chronic inflammatory rheumatic disorders and a wide variety of conditions including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, obesity, cancer, asthma, and ageing. While the inflammatory response observed in the rheumatic disorders seems to be triggered by infection and injury, i. e. the main inducers of inflammation, in the other conditions mentioned it appears to be supported by tissue malfunction or homeostatic imbalance.

50|$|Cancer of {{the colon}} is {{approximately}} as common in {{both men and women}} in the developed world as breast cancer is among average-risk women, with about 6% of people being diagnosed with it, usually over the age of 50. Like sporadic prostate cancer, it is a <b>multifactorial</b> <b>disease,</b> and is affected by age, diet, and similar factors. BRCA mutation carriers have a higher than average risk of this common cancer, but the risk is not as high as in some other hereditary cancers. The risk might be as high as four times normal in some BRCA1 families, and double the normal risk among BRCA2 carriers. Like pancreatic cancer, it may be that only some BRCA mutations or some BRCA families have the extra risk; unlike other BRCA-caused cancers, it does not appear at an earlier age than usual. Normal colon cancer screening is usually recommended to BRCA mutation carriers.|$|E
50|$|Postweaning {{multisystemic}} {{wasting syndrome}} ("PMWS") {{is the classic}} PCVD entity, caused by PCV-2. PCV-2 has a near universal distribution - present in most pig herds. In contrast, PMWS is more sporadic in its distribution. Experimental induction of PMWS has not been achieved by PCV-2 infection alone, using infectious DNA clones of the virus or a pure form of PCV-2 derived from infectious DNA clones. Therefore, {{it is assumed that}} PMWS is a <b>multifactorial</b> <b>disease.</b> PCV-2 is necessary but not sufficient for the development of PMWS. However, viral infection by itself tends to cause only mild disease, and co-factors such as other infections or immunostimulation seem necessary for development of severe disease.1 For example, concurrent infection with porcine parvovirus or PRRS virus, or immunostimulation lead to increased replication of PCV-2 and more severe disease in PCV-2-infected pigs. There is no significant correlation of the disease with virus sequence variation with affected and control pigs.|$|E
50|$|The {{future of}} medicine's focus may {{potentially}} shift from treating existing diseases, typically late in their progression, to preventing disease before it sets in. Predictive health and predictive medicine {{is based on}} probabilities: while it evaluates susceptibility to diseases, it {{is not able to}} predict with 100% certainty that a specific disease will occur. Unlike many preventive interventions that are directed at groups (e.g., immunization programs), predictive medicine is conducted on an individualized basis. For example, glaucoma is a monogenic disease whose early detection can allow to prevent permanent loss of vision. Predictive medicine is expected to be most effective when applied to polygenic <b>multifactorial</b> <b>disease</b> that are prevalent in industrialized countries, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and myocardial infarction. With careful usage, predictive medicine methods such as genetic screens can help diagnose inherited genetic disease caused by problems with a single gene (such as cystic fibrosis) and help early treatment. Some forms of cancer and heart disease are inherited as single-gene diseases and some people in these high-risk families may also benefit from access to genetic tests. As more and more genes associated with increased susceptibility to certain diseases are reported, predictive medicine becomes more useful.|$|E

The large associations tied with being physically fit and reduced cancer risk are enough to provide a strategy to reduce cancer risk.The American Cancer Society assorts different levels of activity ranging from moderate to vigorous to clarify the recommended time spent on a physical activity. These classifications of physical activity consider the intentional exercise and basic activities done on a daily basis and give the public a greater understanding by what fitness levels suffice as future disease prevention.|$|E

While whole-exome sequencing (WES) has already entered the medical practice, recognizing its diagnostic usefulness in <b>multifactorial</b> <b>diseases</b> {{has not yet been}} achieved. Aims. The objective {{of this study was to}} establish usability of WES in determining genetic background of chronic cholestatic liver disease (CLD) in young patients. Methods. WES was performed on six young patients (between 17 and 22 years old) with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis due to CLD and their immediate families. Sequencing was performed on an Ion Proton sequencer. Results. On average, 19, 673 variants were identified, of which from 7 to 14 variants of an individual were nonsynonymous, homozygous, recessively inherited, and considered in silico as pathogenic. Although monogenic cause of CLD has not been determined, several heterozygous rare variants and polymorphisms were uncovered in genes previously known to be associated with CLD, including ATP 8 B 1, ABCB 11, RXRA, and ABCC 4, indicative of multifactorial genetic background. Conclusions.
