5|$|The only {{carnivore}} in the <b>Moluccas</b> is the Malayan civet (Musang), {{which he}} supposes {{has been introduced}} by accident as it is kept for its musk. The Celebes Babirusa is, oddly, found on Bouru, which he supposes it reached partly by swimming, citing Sir Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology to confirm this ability. The other mammals are marsupial, so, he presumes, true natives. In contrast to the few mammals, {{there are at least}} 265 bird species, more than all of Europe, which had 257, but of these just three groups – parrots, kingfishers and pigeons – make up nearly a third, compared to only a twentieth of the birds of India. Wallace suggests this is because they came from New Guinea, which has a similar lack of some groups, and adds that many New Guinea birds have not reached the <b>Moluccas,</b> implying that the islands have been isolated for a long time.|$|E
5|$|It {{was these}} {{similarities}} that lead theorists {{to conclude that}} the kulintang was originally imported to the Philippines during the migration of the kolenang through the Malay Archipelago. Based on the etymology, two routes have been proposed as the route for the kulintang to Mindanao: One from Sunda, through Banjermasin, Brunei and the Sulu Archipelago, a route where the word “kulintangan” is commonly used for the horizontal row of gongs; The other from Sunda, thru, Timor, Sulawesi, <b>Moluccas</b> and Mindanao where the word kolintang/kulintang is commonly seen.|$|E
5|$|Young {{leaves and}} shoots of the durian are {{occasionally}} cooked as greens. Sometimes the ash of the burned rind {{is added to}} special cakes. The petals of durian flowers are eaten in the North Sumatra province of Indonesia, while in the <b>Moluccas</b> islands the husk of the durian fruit is used as fuel to smoke fish. The nectar and pollen of the durian flower that honeybees collect is an important honey source, but {{the characteristics of the}} honey are unknown.|$|E
5|$|After Indonesia's {{independence}} on 17 August 1945, Rijadi led Indonesian {{forces in}} the Surakarta area during the revolution against the returning Dutch. Starting with a guerrilla campaign, by 1947, when he fought against Dutch offensives in Ambarawa and Semarang, {{he was in charge}} of the 26th Regiment. During a second Dutch offensive, Rijadi lost control of the city but soon retook it, later leading counter-offensives in West Java. In 1950, after the end of the revolution, Rijadi was sent to the <b>Moluccas</b> to put down a rebellion. After several months of planning and a month crossing Ambon Island, Rijadi was killed near the end of the operation by a rebounding bullet.|$|E
5|$|Another {{unidentified}} parrot specimen, {{this one}} brown and housed in Cabinet du Roi, {{was described by}} the French naturalist Comte de Buffon in 1779 under his entry for the Mascarene parrot, in which he pointed out {{similarities and differences between}} the two. The English palaeontologist Julian Hume has suggested the possibility that this might have been a lesser vasa parrot, if not a discoloured old Mascarene grey parakeet (Psittacula bensoni). The specimen is now lost. English zoologist and author George Robert Gray assigned some eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) subspecies from the <b>Moluccas</b> to Mascarinus in his book A List of the Genera of Birds from the 1840s, but this idea was soon dismissed by other writers.|$|E
5|$|He {{finds the}} mixture of bird species {{intermediate}} between those of Java and Australia, with 36 species actually Javan, and 11 closely related; while there are only 13 actually Australian, with 35 closely related. Wallace interprets this to mean that {{a small number of}} birds from Australia, and a larger number from Java, colonised Timor and then evolved into new species endemic to the island. The land mammals were very few in number: the six species were endemic or related to those of Java or the <b>Moluccas,</b> with none from Australia, so he doubts there was ever a land bridge to that continent.|$|E
5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} is {{native to}} the coastal waters of the Indo-Pacific region. Its westernmost distribution is India, including Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu (Gulf of Mannar, Tuticorin, Rameswaram) and the Andamans. It occurs in Sri Lanka (Eastern province, Trincomalee), Thailand, Borneo (Brunei, Sabah), Indonesia (<b>Moluccas,</b> Saparua) and the Philippines (Cebu Island, Polillo Islands, Palawan). It is also found further east in Melanesia, including Yos Sudarso Bay in New Guinea, Papua New Guinea, Malaita and Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands, New Caledonia, Kioa Island in Fiji, and New Hebrides. The species is known to occur in Queensland, Australia and north to Vietnam, Taiwan and southern Japan.|$|E
5|$|More new lands were {{opening up}} to European colonial powers, the botanical riches being {{returned}} to European botanists for description. This was a romantic era of botanical explorers, intrepid plant hunters and gardener-botanists. Significant botanical collections came from: the West Indies (Hans Sloane (1660–1753)); China (James Cunningham); the spice islands of the East Indies (<b>Moluccas,</b> George Rumphius (1627–1702)); China and Mozambique (João de Loureiro (1717–1791)); West Africa (Michel Adanson (1727–1806)) who devised his own classification scheme and forwarded a crude theory of the mutability of species; Canada, Hebrides, Iceland, New Zealand by Captain James Cook's chief botanist Joseph Banks (1743–1820).|$|E
5|$|Sailing {{south toward}} {{the island of}} Mindanao, López de Legazpi's fleet {{encountered}} highwinds forcing them to sail northward to the island of Bohol. There, he captured a vessel from Borneo whose Malay sailors informed the Spaniards that the natives inhabiting the region traded with people from Borneo and Indonesia. Arriving in Bohol, López de Legazpi noticed the hostility of the people. The Malayan servant explained that such hostility {{was due to the}} expeditions conducted by the Portuguese from the <b>Moluccas</b> islands. In 1563, Portuguese fleets arrived in Visayan waters and enslaved about 1,000 inhabitants. López de Legazpi, {{with the help of the}} Malayan sailor, explained to the tribes in Bohol that they were not Portuguese and that they had come to the islands to trade. Upon learning this, the chieftains and their tribes became friendlier and welcoming to the Spaniards.|$|E
5|$|Wallace, {{pointing}} out that he often journeyed expressly to obtain specimens, describes the birds-of-paradise in detail, {{and the effects of}} sexual selection by the females. He covers the great, king, red, magnificent, superb, golden or six-shafted, standard wing, twelve-wired, and epimaque or long-tailed birds-of-paradise, as well as three New Guinea birds which he considers almost as remarkable. He suggests they could live well if released in the Palm House at Kew Gardens. In all he knows of 18 species, of which 11 are from New Guinea and 8 are endemic to it and Salwatty, or 14 in the general New Guinea area (1 being from the <b>Moluccas</b> and 3 from Australia). His assistant Mr Allen runs into trouble as the people were suspicious of his motives. A year of five voyages had produced only 5 of the 14 species in the New Guinea area.|$|E
25|$|In 1525, after Fernão de Magalhães's {{expedition}} (1519–1522), Spain under Charles V sent {{an expedition}} to colonize the <b>Moluccas</b> islands, claiming {{that they were in}} his zone of the Treaty of Tordesillas, since there was not a set limit to the east. García Jofre de Loaísa expedition reached the <b>Moluccas,</b> docking at Tidore. The conflict with the Portuguese already established in nearby Ternate was inevitable, starting nearly a decade of skirmishes. An agreement was reached only with the Treaty of Zaragoza (1529), attributing the <b>Moluccas</b> to Portugal and the Philippines to Spain.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the line}} of {{demarcation}} did not encircle the Earth. Instead, Spain and Portugal could conquer any new lands {{they were the first}} to discover, Spain to the west and Portugal to the east, even if they passed each other {{on the other side of}} the globe. But Portugal's discovery of the highly valued <b>Moluccas</b> in 1512 caused Spain to argue in 1518 that the Treaty of Tordesillas divided the Earth into two equal hemispheres. After the surviving ships of Magellan's fleet visited the <b>Moluccas</b> in 1521, Spain claimed that those islands were within its western hemisphere. In 1523, the Treaty of Vitoria called for the Badajoz Junta to meet in 1524, at which the two countries tried to reach an agreement on the anti-meridian but failed. They finally agreed in a treaty signed at Zaragoza that Spain would relinquish its claims to the <b>Moluccas</b> upon the payment of 350,000 ducats (≈100kg) of gold by Portugal to Spain. To prevent Spain from encroaching upon Portugal's <b>Moluccas,</b> the anti-meridian was to be 297.5 leagues or 17° to the east of the <b>Moluccas,</b> passing through the islands of Las Velas and Santo Thome. This distance is slightly smaller than the 300 leagues determined by Magellan as the westward distance from los Ladrones to the Philippine island of Samar, which is just west of due north of the <b>Moluccas.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Moluccas</b> Sea: Arc-Arc Collision – South of Mindanao Island in the <b>Moluccas</b> Sea. Subducting into 2 {{directions:}} to the East {{and to the}} West. This double-vergent subduction causes {{consequently the}} convergence/collision of the 2 corresponding active volcanic arcs. Start of collision in Upper Miocene. Corresponding arcs, the Sangihe and Halmahera, are presently separated by at least 100km.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish {{army in the}} Philippines {{consisted}} of 19 companies. Six of them garrisoned the city of Manila and another one the fort at Cavite. Six were in Ternate (the <b>Moluccas)</b> and three in Formosa (Taiwan). The islands of Oton, Cebu and Caraga each had one company. One company of volunteers was also stationed at Cebu. The Philippines, part of the colony of New Spain, extended from northern Formosa to the <b>Moluccas,</b> {{in what is now}} eastern Indonesia.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} subspecies: the {{nominate}} Scythrops novaehollandiae novaehollandiae of Australia, New Guinea and the <b>Moluccas,</b> Scythrops novaehollandiae fordi in Sulawesi, and Scythrops novaehollandiae schoddei in the Bismarck Archipelago.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish fleet {{entered the}} Strait of Singapore on February 25, 1616. From there Governor de Silva sent Juan Gutierrez Paramo {{with part of}} the fleet to {{reinforce}} Ternate (in the <b>Moluccas).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{governor}} {{set sail}} from Cavite for Pintados in October 1593, {{to join the}} part of the fleet under Luis Pérez already at Pintados. They were then to proceed to the <b>Moluccas.</b>|$|E
25|$|Critics of the governor, both {{among his}} contemporaries and later historians, {{have claimed that}} had he sailed {{directly}} to the <b>Moluccas</b> rather than to Malacca, he very possibly could have dislodged the undermanned Dutch from the archipelago.|$|E
25|$|Catholicism {{arrived in}} Indonesia during the Portuguese arrival with spice trading. Many Portuguese had {{the goal of}} {{spreading}} Roman Catholicism in Indonesia, starting with <b>Moluccas</b> (Maluku) in 1534. Between 1546 and 1547, the pioneer Christian missionary, Saint Francis Xavier, visited the islands and baptised several thousand locals.|$|E
25|$|Fort Oranje is a 17th-century Dutch fort {{located at}} the center of Ternate City on the island of Ternate, one of the <b>Moluccas</b> in Indonesia. The fort is the largest in Ternate Island. Fort Oranje was once the capital of Dutch East India Company's trade empire in Asia until it was moved to Batavia.|$|E
25|$|In June Ringgold {{took part}} in the Marianas operations. During the {{invasion}} of Guam she served as Landing Craft Control Vessel and provided gunfire support. During the initial landing, she dispatched 23 waves of landing craft to the beach. Next came the invasion of Morotai Island, in the Northern <b>Moluccas,</b> where Ringgold again provided gunfire support.|$|E
25|$|Matilda appears for {{the first}} time in the Register of Shipping in 1810. Her master is P. Scott, and her owner Bruce & Co. Matilda participated in the {{expedition}} to the <b>Moluccas</b> and Java in 1810-1812, conducted under the auspices of Lord Minto. She was in the first division, which left Malacca on 8 June 1811.|$|E
25|$|On 16 March 1521 (Spanish calendar), Magellan sighted the {{mountains}} {{of what is now}} Samar while on a mission to find a westward route to the <b>Moluccas</b> Islands for Spain. This event marked the arrival of the first documented Europeans in the Archipelago. The following day, Magellan ordered his men to anchor their ships on the shores of Homonhon Island.|$|E
25|$|To {{the west}} of the continent, New Spain also {{included}} the Spanish East Indies (the Philippine Islands, the Mariana Islands, the Caroline Islands, parts of Taiwan, and parts of the <b>Moluccas).</b> To the east of the continent, it included the Spanish West Indies (Cuba, Hispaniola (comprising the modern states of Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Puerto Rico, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Trinidad, and the Bay Islands).|$|E
25|$|The fleet sailed for the Strait of Malacca, {{with the}} {{intention}} of uniting with the expected Portuguese armada and then attacking the Dutch factory on Java and thereafter the Dutch bases on the islands of the <b>Moluccas.</b> But the Portuguese fleet had already been attacked by the Dutch near Malacca and completely destroyed. In order to avoid their capture, the Portuguese had burned their big galleons.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th century, traders {{brought the}} sweet potato to New Guinea, {{where it was}} adopted and {{became part of the}} staples. Portuguese traders had {{obtained}} it from South America and introduced it to the <b>Moluccas.</b> The far higher crop yields from sweet potato gardens radically transformed traditional agriculture and societies. Sweet potato largely supplanted the previous staple, taro, and resulted in a significant increase in population in the highlands.|$|E
25|$|Fundamentally, the Protestant Dutch {{had strong}} antagonisms {{to both the}} Catholics and the Muslims. In some cases however, alliances, or {{attempts}} at alliance between the Dutch and the Muslims were made possible, as when the Dutch allied with the Muslims of the <b>Moluccas</b> to oust the Portuguese, and the Dutch became rather tolerant of the Islamic religion in their colonial possessions after the final subjugation of Macassar in 1699.|$|E
25|$|Not {{many days}} after {{the return of the}} fleet, there arrived in Manila many Chinese ships, ostensibly for trade. However, they carried many men and little merchandise, with seven Mandarins bearing the {{insignia}} of their office. This led to the suspicion {{on the part of the}} Spaniards that the Chinese had heard of the departure of most of the Spanish forces for the <b>Moluccas,</b> and had sent a fleet to try to conquer the nearly defenseless islands.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not clear}} when Cyrus began her 12th whaling voyage. It is also not entirely clear who her owners were. Her master was Inkstone or John William Hingston. The Register of Shipping gives her master as Hingston and her owner as Jarvis & Co. In September 1831 {{she was at the}} <b>Moluccas</b> with 900 barrels. On 12 August 1833 she was at St Helena, having come from Timor. She {{returned}} to Britain on 18 October 1833.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 19th century, colonial Penang thrived from trade in pepper and spices, Indian piece goods, betel nut, tin, opium and rice. The Bengal Presidency {{was aware of}} Penang's {{potential}} {{as an alternative to}} Dutch <b>Moluccas</b> as a source of spice production. Spice cultivation on Penang Island became the chief means of covering administrative costs in Penang. The development of the spice economy drove the movement of Chinese settlers to Penang Island, which was actively encouraged by the British.|$|E
25|$|As the Dutch and English made encroachments on the {{overseas}} trade, {{they were unable}} to seize the Spanish territorial empires of Mexico and Peru, so they concentrated on taking the Portuguese trading posts, ports and coastal colonies that provided the goods trafficked in Lisbon. The northeastern ports of Brazil, the Cape of Good Hope, other ports in East Africa, Ceylon, Malacca and the <b>Moluccas</b> Islands were taken, as well as the island of Formosa (Taiwan) and the trade concession in Japan.|$|E
25|$|Pinto {{noted that}} {{there were a number of}} Lucoes in the Islamic fleets that went to battle with the Portuguese in the Philippines during the 16th century. The Sultan of Aceh gave one of them (Sapetu Diraja) the task of holding Aru (northeast Sumatra) in 1540. Pinto also says one was named leader of the Malays {{remaining}} in the <b>Moluccas</b> Islands after the Portuguese conquest in 1511. Pigafetta notes that one of them was in command of the Brunei fleet in 1521.|$|E
25|$|As a {{merchant}} and Calvinist, Coen was {{convinced of the}} necessity of strict enforcement of contracts entered into with Asian rulers. He therefore aided Indonesian princes against their indigenous rivals or against other European powers and was given commercial monopolies for the company in return. Thus the Dutch, at the price of heavy military and naval investment, slowly gained control of the area’s rich spice trade. Between 1614 and 1618, Coen secured a clove monopoly in the <b>Moluccas</b> and a nutmeg monopoly in the Banda Islands.|$|E
25|$|In 1593, Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas {{organized}} {{an expedition}} from Manila {{to capture the}} fort at Terrenate, in the <b>Moluccas.</b> (Two previous Spanish expeditions, in 1582 and 1584, had failed.) Pérez Dasmariñas had planned this expedition for some time, but in secret, and did not reveal his intention until most of the preparations had been made. He intended to lead the expedition personally. Before he set sail, he sent his son, Luis Pérez Dasmariñas, on ahead with part of the fleet to the province of Pintado.|$|E
25|$|The colony was {{now without}} a governor. Pérez Dasmariñas {{had brought with}} him to the Philippines a royal order {{directing}} him to choose a temporary successor in the event of his own death. He had shown this order to various prominent Spaniards in the colony, implying to each that he was the designated successor. In particular, both the governor's son and conquistador Captain Estevan Rodríguez de Figueroa expected the appointment. Both were on the expedition to the <b>Moluccas,</b> and both hurried back to Manila to take command of the colony.|$|E
25|$|De Silva sent an {{unsuccessful}} expedition against the Dutch in the <b>Moluccas</b> in 1611, although the expedition did take Sabougo on Gilolo {{and establish a}} fort there. De Silva intended to secure Portuguese help to expel the Dutch from the area once and for all. To this end in 1612 he dispatched {{the former governor of}} Ternate, Cristobal de Azcueta to Portuguese India to make plans with the viceroy there for a joint assault. However Azcueta and the entire expedition were lost in a shipwreck between Manila and Macao.|$|E
