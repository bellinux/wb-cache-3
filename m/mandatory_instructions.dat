Thus signs indicating dangers are triangular with a red border, those giving orders are almost all circular (white on blue for <b>mandatory</b> <b>instructions,</b> black on white with a red border for prohibitions), and those providing information are rectangular. Most signs use pictograms to convey their particular meaning.|$|E

While TCAS operates with more precision than PCAS but is also more expensive and usually requires in-aircraft installation whereas Typical PCAS systems do not. Another important difference is that TCAS gives <b>mandatory</b> <b>instructions</b> where PCAS only alerts the pilot and may give a suggestion {{as to how to}} act. [...] A very well known general aviation organization completed an evaluation of the PCAS XRX system to demonstrate the capabilities.|$|E

Like other countries, the signs use pictograms to display their meaning. Any text included in signs will normally be in Korean and English. Signs are normally placed 1 to 2.1 meters high.|$|E

50|$|In July 1940, Beovich {{arranged}} for a Catholic lawyer to draft a bill entitling religious ministers to give thirty minutes of religious instruction per week to students in government schools belonging to their denomination. Drafted as a compromise between the lack of religious education in state schools at the time, and <b>mandatory</b> <b>instruction</b> by schoolteachers (which had been opposed by Adelaide Catholic Church), it was introduced to state parliament as a private member's bill by then opposition leader Robert Richards. With the support of education minister Shirley Jeffries, the bill won passage through both houses of parliament and became law.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} effects of a high school {{curriculum}} reform on students 4 probability to enroll at university and to choose Science, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics (STEM) as college major. The reform that was introduced in one German state increased the degree of difficulty {{to graduate from high school}} by increasing the <b>mandatory</b> <b>instruction</b> time in the core subjects German, a foreign language, mathematics and natural sciences and by raising the graduation requirements. Based on administrative data covering all students, the empirical analysis is carried out by applying a difference-in-differences model. The results show that the reform increased university enrollment rates for both gender. With regard to choosing STEM as college major, we only find a robust positive effect for males...|$|R

In some cases, religious societies decide that the administrative cost of providing religious instruction is too great to warrant providing such courses in all schools. Attendance in religious <b>instruction</b> is <b>mandatory</b> and <b>instruction</b> either takes place in the school or at sites organized by the religious groups.

Some academic press publishing companies have assigned a proper noun-like title to Muslims without a specific sectarian affiliation by capitalizing the designation as Just a Muslim. The customs and rituals practised by non-denominational Muslims in Northern Nigeria are statistically more likely to be Sunni-inclined.

40|$|Defendant {{was convicted}} of rape, oral copulation, and {{attempted}} sodomy in Superior Court, Los Angeles County. The case against him rested predominantly on the testimony of his adult victim, partially corroborated as to identity by a scratch on defendant’s forehead, and further substantiated by defendant’s “if I did it I was drunk” admission to the police. The defendant appealed alleging error by the trial judge for failing to give a <b>mandatory</b> cautionary <b>instruction.</b> The California Supreme Court held that because the defendant was entitled to the cautionary instruction the trial judge had committed error in refusing to give it. Such error, however, was not prejudicial. The defendant’s conviction was affirmed.

40|$|Matching {{the results}} {{achieved}} during circuit simulation with those extracted from circuit functioning {{is a common}} verification process. A large number of current verification techniques use the input / output vectors produced during functional simulation as the test vectors applied / compared against the circuit responses. Techniques that are more complete include extracting the values of internal sequential nodes and comparing these using internal scans. This paper describes a solution for verifying digital designs implemented in currently commercial available CPLDs. All internal flip-flops are included in a scan-chain accessible through the BST infrastructure (using a user-defined optional instruction), while the BS cells are used to apply the input test vectors and capture the circuit responses. These BS cells can either belong to the device-under-test or to other devices, the first controlled through the optional INTEST instruction and the second controlled through the <b>mandatory</b> EXTEST <b>instruction.</b> To speed up the verification process, the test program is automatically generated from information that encompasses the design & development phase. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

50|$|The {{process of}} {{secularization}} in Syria began under the French mandate in the 1920s {{and went on}} continuously under different governments since the independence. Syria has been governed by the Arab nationalist Ba'ath Party since 1963. The Ba'ath government combined Arab socialism with secular ideology and an authoritarian political system. The constitution guarantees religious freedom for every recognized religious communities, including many Christian denominations. All schools are government-run and non-sectarian, although there is <b>mandatory</b> religious <b>instruction,</b> provided in Islam and/or Christianity. Political forms of Islam are not tolerated by the government. The Syrian legal system is primarily based on civil law, and was heavily influenced by the period of French rule. It is also drawn in part from Egyptian law of Abdel Nasser, quite from the Ottoman Millet system and very little from Sharia. Syria has separate secular and religious courts. Civil and criminal cases are heard in secular courts, while the Sharia courts handle personal, family, and religious matters in cases between Muslims or between Muslims and non-Muslims. Non-Muslim communities have their own religious courts using their own religious law.|$|R
50|$|While the French {{trace the}} {{development}} of their educational system to Napoléon, the modern era of French education begins {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century. Jules Ferry, a Minister of Public Instruction in the 1880s, is widely credited for creating the modern school (l'école républicaine) by requiring all children between the ages of 6 and 12, both boys and girls, to attend. He also made public <b>instruction</b> <b>mandatory,</b> free of charge, and secular (laïque). With these laws, known as French Lubbers, Jules Ferry laws, and several others, the Third Republic repealed most of the Falloux Laws of 1850-1851, which gave an important role to the clergy.|$|R
