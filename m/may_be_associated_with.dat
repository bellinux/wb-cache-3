5|$|Trousseau's syndrome, {{in which}} blood clots form spontaneously in the portal blood vessels, the deep veins of the extremities, or the {{superficial}} veins {{anywhere on the}} body, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> pancreatic cancer, and is found in about 10% of cases.|$|E
5|$|Visuospatial or {{constructional}} abnormalities here <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> {{parietal lobe}} pathology, and abnormalities in executive functioning tests may indicate frontal lobe pathology.

50|$|May: The {{month of}} <b>May</b> <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the Lily {{of the valley}} flower. It is {{generally}} white in colour. The flower conveys sweetness and humility. In the Victorian era, it was gifted to convey the romantic message ‘you have made my life complete’.|$|R

5|$|Iodine {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} common cause of primary hypothyroidism and endemic goiter worldwide. In areas of the world with sufficient dietary iodine, hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis). Hashimoto's <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> a goiter. It is characterized by infiltration of the thyroid gland with T lymphocytes and autoantibodies against specific thyroid antigens such as thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin and the TSH receptor.|$|E
5|$|Mild {{impairment}} {{of attention and}} concentration may occur in any mental illness where people are anxious and distractible (including psychotic states), but more extensive cognitive abnormalities are likely to indicate a gross disturbance of brain functioning such as delirium, dementia or intoxication. Specific language abnormalities <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> pathology in Wernicke's area or Broca's area of the brain. In Korsakoff's syndrome there is dramatic memory impairment with relative preservation of other cognitive functions.|$|E
5|$|NGC 6251 is {{an active}} supergiant {{elliptical}} radio galaxy more than 340 million light-years away from Earth.

This galaxy <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> gamma-ray source 3EG J1621+8203, which has high-energy gamma-ray emission. It is also noted for its one-sided radio jet—one of the brightest known—discovered in 1977.|$|E

5|$|Specific {{adverse events}} {{are related to}} the {{antiretroviral}} agent taken. Some relatively common adverse events include: lipodystrophy syndrome, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, especially with protease inhibitors. Other common symptoms include diarrhea, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Newer recommended treatments are associated with fewer adverse effects. Certain medications <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> birth defects and therefore may be unsuitable for women hoping to have children.|$|E
5|$|Tengu are {{commonly}} depicted holding a magical , fans made of feathers.

5|$|The {{majority}} of Muslims {{in the country}} are adherents of a moderate branch of mystical Islam (Sufism). Its most common expression is the Tijaniyah, an order followed by the 35% of Chadian Muslims which incorporates some local African religious elements. A small minority of the country's Muslims hold more fundamentalist practices, which, in some cases, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> Saudi-oriented Salafi movements.|$|E
5|$|An astronomical text {{recovered}} from Tomb no.3 in Mawangdui contains images {{and descriptions of}} 29 different comets. The descriptions often include the comet's name, notes about its apparition, and its associated portent, usually military, but lack detailed dates of the comets' sightings. This text can be solidly dated as being prior to 168 BC, the date assigned to the tomb. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> a similar astronomical text from the same tomb, which details planetary motions for the seventy years ending 177 BC.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes are not rigid, static structures; {{instead they}} have complex {{internal}} dynamic motions – that is, {{movements of parts}} of the enzyme's structure such as individual amino acid residues, groups of residues forming a protein loop or unit of secondary structure, or even an entire protein domain. These motions {{give rise to a}} conformational ensemble of slightly different structures that interconvert with one another at equilibrium. Different states within this ensemble <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> different aspects of an enzyme's function. For example, different conformations of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase are associated with the substrate binding, catalysis, cofactor release, and product release steps of the catalytic cycle.|$|E

5|$|Folklore often {{identifies}} a green {{sky with}} tornadoes, {{and though the}} phenomenon <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> severe weather, {{there is no evidence}} linking it specifically with tornadoes. It is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in atmospheric pressure inside a strong tornado, {{it is unlikely that the}} pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis {{typically}} involves both {{diarrhea and}} vomiting, or less commonly, presents {{with only one}} or the other. Abdominal cramping may also be present. Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72hours after contracting the infectious agent. If due to a viral agent, the condition usually resolves within one week. Some viral causes may also be associated with fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain. If the stool is bloody, the cause {{is less likely to}} be viral and more likely to be bacterial. Some bacterial infections <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.|$|E
5|$|Her name {{given at}} birth was Yalurrngali: Peggy Rockman was a name {{subsequently}} {{given to her}} by white administrators. 'Napaljarri' (in Warlpiri) or 'Napaltjarri' (in Western Desert dialects) is a skin name, one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the kinship system of central Australian Indigenous people. These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> particular totems. Although they {{may be used as}} terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans. Thus 'Peggy Rockman' is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers.|$|E
