40|$|Application {{inconvenience}} is {{one popular}} {{explanation for why}} many individuals do not receive the social benefits {{for which they are}} eligible. Applications take time and some individuals may decide that the financial benefits do not outweigh these time costs. This paper investigates this explanation using cross-state variation in administrative changes that made applying for unemployment insurance (UI) benefits substantially more convenient over the past decade. We find that the introduction of phone- and Internet-based claiming did not have an appreciable impact on overall UI take-up, nor did it lead to a shift toward recipients that are higher income or likely to be receiving the <b>maximum</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>amount.</b> These findings are inconsistent with a time- and transaction-cost explanation for low take-up, since remote UI claiming is less time intensive. This suggests that reducing application barriers alone may not be an effective tool for increasing program participation. © 2010 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management. ...|$|E
30|$|UI is a federal-state {{partnership}} providing short-term {{cash benefits}} {{to individuals who}} lose their jobs {{through no fault of}} their own, i.e. either involuntarily or voluntarily with a good cause (e.g. due to illness). Unemployed workers are eligible for UI benefits if they fulfill all monetary and non-monetary requirements. Monetary entitlement requires sufficiently high wage earnings during the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters before the worker files a claim. Non-monetary eligibility criteria concern both the reason for job separation and ongoing claims. Weekly UI benefit formulas specify a minimum and a <b>maximum</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>amount</b> as well as a percentage within these boundaries. The duration of benefits is either set at a fixed level for all UI recipients (nine states), or depends on the total amount of benefits unemployed workers can receive during their eligibility period. Since we cannot infer the reasons for a job separation from the survey and we are not able to determine the exhaustion of UI benefits, our analysis focuses on UI recipiency. About 5 percent receive UI benefits at the time of application.|$|E

40|$|The Act, {{called the}} Employment Security and Enhancement Act of 2002, amends {{unemployment}} coverage for workers {{by creating an}} alternative base period to qualify more people by including their most recent quarter of earnings for eligibility determination. The Act increases deductible earnings from thirty dollars each week to fifty dollars each week for claims filed after July 1, 2002. The Act also changes the provisions relating to benefit experience and variations from the standard rate of employer contributions and to the State-wide Reserve Ratio and reductions in tax rate. The Act also increases the <b>maximum</b> weekly <b>benefit</b> <b>amount</b> from $ 284. 00 for claims filed before July 1, 2002, to $ 295. 00 for claims filed after July 1, 2002, and to $ 300. 00 for claims filed after July 1, 2003...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} workers' compensation on the time until an injured worker returns to work. Two large increases in the <b>maximum</b> weekly <b>benefit</b> <b>amount</b> in Kentucky am Michigan are examined. The increases raised the <b>benefit</b> <b>amount</b> for high earnings individuals by over sixty percent, while low earnings individuals, who did not earn enough {{to be eligible for}} the old maximum, did not experience a change in their incentives. A comparison of the behavior of pecp 1 e injured the year before the benefit increases to those injured the year after provides an estimate of the effect of higher benefits on injury duration. This use of a "natural experiment" allows us to separate the effect of the level of the benefits from the effect of previous earnings, which is a common difficulty in the analysis of social insurance programs. The analysis uses individual records from a large number of insurance companies. Time out of work increases dramatically for those groups eligible for the higher benefits, while those whose benefits do not change do not experience a change in duration. The estimates suggest large moral hazard effects of higher benefits, with the estimated elasticity of spell duration with respect to benefits of approximately. 3 to. 4. ...|$|R

30|$|For {{the groups}} of agents older than 45, the <b>maximum</b> <b>benefit</b> {{duration}} became {{a function of the}} number of years of social security contributions. The dataset does not have the complete record of social contributions, and so, we cannot determine the increase in the <b>maximum</b> <b>benefit</b> duration. For the group 55 – 64, the reform introduced early retirement after a period of unemployment with little or no penalties. Early retirement affects agents in different ways than the increase in the <b>maximum</b> duration of <b>benefits.</b> For these reasons, we concentrate our analysis on the groups 15 – 24, 30 – 34, and 40 – 44. For these groups, we can determine the increase in the <b>maximum</b> <b>benefit</b> duration, and this was the only change of the reform.
