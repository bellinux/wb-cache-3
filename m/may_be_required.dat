5|$|Treatment {{may include}} {{activated}} charcoal {{if the person}} presents soon after the overdose. Attempting to force the person to vomit is not recommended. If {{there is a potential}} for toxicity, the antidote acetylcysteine is recommended. The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours. Psychiatric care <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> following recovery. A liver transplant <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on low blood pH, high blood lactate, poor blood clotting, or significant hepatic encephalopathy. With early treatment liver failure is rare. Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.|$|E
5|$|Visual {{field testing}} is {{recommended}} {{as soon as}} possible after diagnosis, as it quantifies the severity of any optic nerve involvement, and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to decide on surgical treatment.|$|E
5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of hypothyroidism without any lumps or masses felt within the thyroid gland {{does not require}} thyroid imaging; however, if the thyroid feels abnormal, diagnostic imaging is then recommended. The presence of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) makes {{it more likely that}} thyroid nodules are caused by autoimmune thyroiditis, but if there is any doubt, a needle biopsy <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>required.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Lord!" [...] said Mr. Marvel. [...] "But I'm {{all in a}} tizzy. <b>May</b> I ask--How <b>is</b> it? And {{what you}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>requiring</b> {{in the way of}} help?--Invisible!" ...|$|R

5|$|If after 2–4days {{there is}} still {{evidence}} of an air leak, various options are available. Negative pressure suction (at low pressures of –10 to –20cmH2O) at a high flow rate may be attempted, particularly in PSP; {{it is thought that}} this may accelerate the healing of the leak. Failing this, surgery <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>required,</b> especially in SSP.|$|E
5|$|In Active Directory environments, BitLocker {{supports}} optional {{key escrow}} to Active Directory, although a schema update <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> {{for this to}} work (i.e. if the Active Directory Services are hosted on a Windows version previous to Windows Server 2008).|$|E
5|$|In some instances, lumbar {{puncture}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> {{if there is}} a suspicion that the symptoms might be caused by other problems (meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage). This is the examination of the cerebrospinal fluid that envelops the brain and the spinal cord; the sample is obtained with a needle that is passed under local anesthetic into the spine. In pituitary apoplexy the results are typically normal, although abnormalities may be detected if blood from the pituitary has entered the subarachnoid space. If there is remaining doubt about the possibility of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRI with a contrast agent) <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to identify aneurysms of the brain blood vessels, {{the most common cause of}} SAH.|$|E

40|$|Sonic {{hedgehog}} (Shh) is a morphogen secreted {{during early}} development that <b>is</b> <b>required</b> {{for the formation}} of the ventral neural tube, including the ventral forebrain. The prechordal source of Shh underlying the forebrain <b>is</b> <b>required</b> early to bifurcate the cerebral hemispheres and eye vesicles as well as to specify a rostroventral forebrain region, the hypothalamus. We hypothesized that Shh expressed later in the hypothalamus <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>require...</b>|$|R
5|$|Internal {{cleaning}} of diving cylinders <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to remove contaminants or to allow effective visual inspection. Cleaning methods should remove contaminants and corrosion products without undue removal of structural metal. Chemical cleaning using solvents, detergents and pickling agents {{may be used}} depending on the contaminant and cylinder material. Tumbling with abrasive media may be needed for heavy contamination, particularly of heavy corrosion products.|$|E
5|$|Kidney {{dysfunction}} typically develops 1–2days {{after the}} initial muscle damage. If supportive treatment is inadequate to manage this, renal replacement therapy (RRT) <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>required.</b> RRT removes excess potassium, acid and phosphate that accumulate when the kidneys are unable to function normally and is required until kidney function is regained.|$|E
5|$|Only certain traits <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> {{to deceive}} predators; for example, {{tests on the}} sympatry/allopatry border (where the two {{are in the same}} area, and where they are not) of the mimic Lampropeltis elapsoides and the model Micrurus fulvius showed that color {{proportions}} in these snakes were important in deceiving predators, but that the order of the colored rings was not.|$|E
50|$|Migration <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>required</b> {{when the}} {{hardware}} {{is no longer}} available. See JOVIAL.|$|R
50|$|They <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>required</b> {{to study}} one Asian culture to an {{advanced}} level.|$|R
50|$|Lifeguards <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>required</b> {{to attend}} {{occasional}} in-service meetings {{to strengthen their}} lifeguarding skills.|$|R
5|$|Portable {{ventilators}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> {{to support}} breathing. Historically, a noninvasive, negative-pressure ventilator, more commonly called an iron lung, {{was used to}} artificially maintain respiration during an acute polio infection until a person could breathe independently (generally about one to two weeks). Today, many polio survivors with permanent respiratory paralysis use modern jacket-type negative-pressure ventilators worn over the chest and abdomen.|$|E
5|$|Section 2.3(a): The {{primary mission}} of the AFL shall be to defend the {{national}} sovereignty and territorial integrity of Liberia, including land, air and maritime territory, against external aggressions, insurgency, terrorism and encroachment. In addition thereto the AFL shall respond to natural disasters and engage in other civic works as <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> or directed.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{is usually}} treated with urgent needle decompression. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> before transport to the hospital, {{and can be}} performed by an emergency medical technician or other trained professional. The needle or cannula is left in place until a chest tube can be inserted. If tension pneumothorax leads to cardiac arrest, needle decompression is performed as part of resuscitation as it may restore cardiac output.|$|E

50|$|Treatment {{is usually}} {{surgical}} {{removal of the}} gland(s) containing adenomas, but medication <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>required.</b>|$|R
5|$|The League {{undertakes}} {{the responsibility}} for the care and safe custody of the Stanley Cup including all necessary repairs and alterations to the cup and sub-structure as <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> from time to time, and further undertakes to insure the Stanley Cup for its full insurable value.|$|E
5|$|The first {{priority}} in suspected or confirmed pituitary apoplexy is stabilization of the circulatory system. Cortisol deficiency can cause severe low blood pressure. Depending on {{the severity of}} the illness, admission to a high dependency unit (HDU) <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>required.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} can {{be repeated}} if necessary, {{but this is}} generally taken as a clue that additional treatments <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to control the symptoms and preserve vision. Repeated lumbar punctures are regarded as unpleasant by patients, and they present a danger of introducing spinal infections if done too often. Repeated lumbar punctures are sometimes needed to control the ICP urgently if the patient's vision deteriorates rapidly.|$|E
5000|$|Forensic physicians, {{as well as}} pathologists <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>required</b> {{to examine}} (traumatic) wounds on people.|$|R

50|$|At English-speaking universities, {{a student}} <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to {{demonstrate}} English language abilities, usually by achieving an acceptable score {{on a standard}} examination (for example the Test of English as a Foreign Language). Depending on the field, the student <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to demonstrate ability {{in one or more}} additional languages. A prospective student applying to French-speaking universities may also have to demonstrate some English language ability.|$|R
5|$|These {{symptoms}} may {{be severe}} enough to warrant hospitalisation. Treatment is supportive; antispasmodic medicines may lessen colicky abdominal cramps, and activated charcoal may be administered early on to bind residual toxin. Intravenous fluids <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> if dehydration has been extensive, especially with children and the elderly. Once gastric contents are emptied, metoclopramide {{may be used in}} cases of recurrent vomiting.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} {{applications}} in industry, but their main use is as additives to animal feed. This is necessary, since many of the bulk components of these feeds, such as soybeans, either have low levels or lack some of the essential amino acids: lysine, methionine, threonine, and tryptophan are most important in the production of these feeds. In this industry, amino acids are also used to chelate metal cations in order to improve the absorption of minerals from supplements, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to improve the health or production of these animals.|$|E
5|$|Cancer {{changes over}} time, and pain {{management}} needs to reflect this. Several {{different types of}} treatment <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> as the disease progresses. Pain managers should clearly explain to the patient {{the cause of the}} pain and the various treatment possibilities, and should consider, as well as drug therapy, directly modifying the underlying disease, raising the pain threshold, interrupting, destroying or stimulating pain pathways, and suggesting lifestyle modification. The relief of psychological, social and spiritual distress is a key element in effective pain management.|$|E
