5000|$|Kuvira's rise {{to power}} and {{subsequent}} ruling over the Earth Kingdom has been compared by commentators to fascism and marxism. Kuvira has also been equated to a female version of Adolf Hitler, <b>Matt</b> <b>Patches</b> of ScreenCrush writing, [...] "The same way a guy like Hitler can {{rise to power}} before a global audience and go unopposed by American forces for years into World War II, Kuvira can orchestrate fascist evil behind-close-doors and remain untouchable." ...|$|R
2500|$|Film Journal Internationals Ethan Alter {{commented that}} the film is [...] "confounding, {{challenging}} and consistently unique." [...] IGN reviewer <b>Matt</b> <b>Patches</b> gave the film an 8.9 out of 10 score, saying [...] "There's nothing certain – a surprisingly rewarding sensation that demands repeat viewings. There's so much, too much, to soak up, and all the laughter Anderson piles {{on top of the}} thematics means there's plenty to miss. Inherent Vice is a high grain strain: Provocative, hilarious, and its own breed of weird." [...] Collider.com's Adam Chitwood named it one of the top ten films of 2014.|$|R
5000|$|Recently {{there has}} been {{discussion}} of a male version of this trope, the Manic Pixie Dream Boy or Manic Pixie Dream Guy. Augustus Waters from {{the film version of}} The Fault in Our Stars (2014) was given this title in a 2014 Vulture article, in which <b>Matt</b> <b>Patches</b> stated, [...] "he's a bad boy, he's a sweetheart, he's a dumb jock, he's a nerd, he's a philosopher, he's a poet, he's a victim, he's a survivor, he's everything everyone wants in their lives, and he's a fallacious notion of what we can actually have in our lives." ...|$|R
500|$|... "While it's easy to {{complain}} about a stretch of so-so movies," [...] wrote <b>Matt</b> <b>Patches</b> at Hollywood.com as 2012 began, [...] "the twist is we should really be thanking the studios for catering to niche audiences all month." [...] For most viewers, it {{is a chance to}} catch up on the major awards contenders released in December. But studios and the filmgoers who have already seen those two films can benefit from creative risk-taking by filmmakers. He points to Cloverfield as one such gamble that succeeded. Smaller film distributors also take advantage of the dump months to bring little-seen but highly praised films like Kill List to wider audiences via home-media releases.|$|R
5000|$|The Playlist's Todd Gilchrist {{gave it a}} mixed review {{saying that}} it has [...] "great ideas ... and some terrific {{character}} work, but it's given such uneven attention, alternately languished upon and glossed over". IGN's <b>Matt</b> <b>Patches</b> gave it 5.8 out of 10, citing its similarities to other young adult films and contrived Dauntless plot line. He praised lead actors Theo James and Shailene Woodley's performances, judging that they [...] "add personality and physicality to the limp script they're acting out". Scott Mendelson of Forbes magazine echoed these sentiments, arguing that despite Woodley's excellent performance, [...] "the generic story reduced {{a large portion of}} the mythology to irrelevancy". Mendelson believed that the film would please the novel's fanbase.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Matt</b> <b>Patches</b> of ScreenCrush {{compared}} Bolin and Varrick's escape in {{the season}} four episode [...] "Reunion" [...] to the 2008 film Defiance, where the characters are [...] "blasting their way through enemies as they survived in the woods." [...] Patches enjoyed the comedy in the dialogue between Bolin and Varrick, but also comments that [...] "there’s {{a tremendous amount of}} moral insight too." [...] Reviewer Michael Mammano of Den of Geek also praised Bolin's role in this episode, pointing out the [...] "sense of authority and competence he’s developed" [...] and noting that he is [...] "far more poised and precise" [...] than in previous seasons. P.J. Byrne also drew praise for his frenetic voicework, with reviewer Oliver Sava noting that Byrne's performance helped convincingly reflect the character's occasionally [...] "chaotic" [...] mindset.|$|R
500|$|David Hinckley of the New York Daily News {{wrote that}} the [...] "visually striking" [...] series is [...] "full of little tricks and nuances that only true fans will notice and savor, but nothing {{prevents}} civilians from enjoying it as well." [...] Writing for Vulture, <b>Matt</b> <b>Patches</b> highlighted the second season's loose, handheld-style cinematography– challenging for an animated series– and the [...] "weird, wonderful", wildly imagined spirits fought by Korra; [...] "a Kaiju parade with beasts that mirror velociraptors". Max Nicholson for IGN described the third season as [...] "easily the show's most consistent season to date, delivering complex themes, excellent storylines and unmatched production values." [...] And Oliver Sava, for The A.V. Club, characterized it as a [...] "truly magnificent season of television, delivering loads of character development, world building, socio-political commentary, and heart-racing action, all presented with beautifully smooth animation and impeccable voice acting".|$|R
5000|$|<b>Matt</b> <b>Patches</b> of Hollywood.com {{wrote that}} the festival is more {{important}} than ever after Beasts of the Southern Wild, which debuted at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival, winning the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize and the U.S. Dramatic Cinematography Award, and going on to garner four Oscar nominations at the 85th Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Actress). He wrote, [...] "we're living in a post-Beasts world where a Sundance unknown can end a year-long journey at the Best Directors table." [...] He said [...] "studios are looking to Sundance for recommendations." [...] Robert Redford said Beasts of the Southern Wild [...] "is probably one of the great examples that we have of why Sundance is here and what my intention was to begin with." [...] Kristopher Tapley wrote the film [...] "was nurtured through the Sundance Institute's system every step of the way", mentioning the Screenwriters Lab, the Directors Lab, and funding at the Creative Producing Summit.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{publications}} {{reviewed the}} two premiere episodes jointly. The A.V. Club's Emily Guendelsberger {{noted that they}} kept up the first season's plot's [...] "breckneck pace" [...] and appeared intent on signaling a break with the convention of avoiding death in children's entertainment, by showing a spirit dragging a sailor to his likely death in the sea. She appreciated the nuanced portrayal of Korra's and Mako's relationship and Korra's character flaws, but remarked that Unalaq was being set up as the season's antagonist a bit too obviously. At TV.com, Noel Kirkpatrick commented favorably on how [...] "one of television's best programs" [...] handled the necessary quantity of exposition, and on its introduction of the theme of conflict between spiritualism and secularism. Writing for Vulture, <b>Matt</b> <b>Patches</b> highlighted the loose, handheld-style cinematography - challenging for an animated series - and the [...] "weird, wonderful", wildly imagined spirits fought by Korra; [...] "a Kaiju parade with beasts that mirror velociraptors".|$|R
500|$|In {{reviews for}} the first five episodes of the series, Brian Lowry of Variety felt that [...] "Compared to Marvel's {{experience}} with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. for ABC, operating in Netflix's pay-to-view world is clearly liberating" [...] in terms of what can be done and shown. <b>Matt</b> <b>Patches</b> of Esquire added, [...] "The show's exterior recasts the high fructose, splash page aesthethic of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America with neo-noir attitude. Goddard and DeKnight drench Daredevil in shadows and blood." [...] He compared Daredevil to [...] "a TV spinoff" [...] of Christopher Nolans Batman films, and praised Cox and D'Onofrio's portrayals, while criticizing a subplot involving Nelson and Page and noting that the slow pacing of Daredevil, in which story may be stretched out more than needs be, could be a problem for binge-watchers. Victoria McNally of MTV felt the early episodes' fight sequences were [...] "filmed beautifully" [...] and enjoyed that they featured little CGI, while also calling Henson [...] "perfectly cast and endlessly amusing" [...] as Nelson.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{critics were}} struck by {{what they saw as}} {{parallels}} in the movie's plot, dialogue and imagery with the Scientology teachings of L. Ron Hubbard particularly those in [...] and Dianetics: The Original Thesis. Similarly, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone compared the film to the Scientology-themed flop Battlefield Earth, describing the film as [...] "an unholy mess of platitudes and posturing" [...] that wastes the talents and charm of Will Smith. Pointing out Smith's alleged ties to Scientology, including his funding of New Village Leadership Academy, a school that uses Study Tech as its teaching method, <b>Matt</b> <b>Patches</b> of Vulture declared the movie probably the clearest evidence of Smith's investment in Scientology, and detailed how he saw the film paralleling its teachings. The Hollywood Reporter published a guest-column review written by former Scientology member Marc Headley which pointed out similar parallels. The Sun noted an observation made by a former Scientologist that the fictional Rangers Corps is similar to the church's Sea Org branch, which has its own cadet branch.|$|R

5000|$|The website Slash film lists Attack the Block as a [...] "true cult classic" [...] {{deserving of}} its own action figures. In his review, Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert praised the film's use of {{character}} development and the performance given by John Boyega. Scott Wampler of The Examiner rated it A+ {{and said it was}} officially the best film of the 2011 film festival season and likened it to other debuts such as Neill Blomkamp's District 9 and Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. <b>Matt</b> <b>Patches</b> writing for Cinemablend said [...] "Attack the Block, even on its small scale, may wind up {{as one of the best}} action movies of the year". Christ Tilly at IGN gave it four stars saying [...] "Cornish directs with the confidence of a seasoned pro" [...] and calling the film [...] "a blast from start-to-finish." [...] Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy awarded the movie four stars, saying that it is [...] "exactly the kind of distinctly homegrown product that the British film industry should be making". Mark Kermode gave a mixed review saying he did not dislike the film, but [...] "wanted it to be funnier" [...] and [...] "needed it to be scarier".|$|R
5000|$|The premiere episode {{screened}} {{in advance}} at Comic-Con was positively reviewed by Max Nicholson of IGN, who appreciated the setup of the overarching {{conflict and the}} humorous writing. He also stated that [...] "the animation in Book Two has taken yet another step up in quality, with noticeable advances in the action sequences and color treatment". At TV.com, Noel Kirkpatrick commented favorably on how the episode handled the necessary quantity of exposition, and on its introduction of the theme of conflict between spiritualism and secularism.

5000|$|Reviewers have {{consistently}} spoke of how despite being an antagonist, Kuvira was understandable in her rationale behind her actions. Max Nicholson of IGN {{felt that the}} writers of the series did [...] "a {{pretty good job of}} relating" [...] Kuvira's motives rationally and felt her scene with Korra in [...] "Enemy at the Gates" [...] since {{it was the first time}} they sized each other up, also stating that the meeting convey how similar they were. Michael Mammaro wrote that while Kuvira was [...] "a force to be reckoned with", he could not see her defeating Korra since the Avatar had just became empowered again. <b>Matt</b> <b>Patches</b> admitted to having first considered Kuvira a sociopath who was [...] "lost in a cloud of ideology", but Patches believed following her fight with Korra that she was also [...] "a little more cognizant" [...] in regards to her own valor. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club wrote that the audience saw her out of the public eye during the initial fight with Korra for the first time, but it was [...] "hard to hate her after the work the writers have done establishing her motivations." [...] Additionally, Mordicai Knode of Tor.com felt the character was the [...] "winner" [...] of the conflict after defeating Korra in the one-on-one fight, also in Knode's opinion making Korra and Suyin losers.|$|R
5000|$|John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "Throughout, gags are cartoonishly {{broad and}} afforded {{so little time}} for setup and {{delivery}} {{we seem to be}} watching less a story than a catalog of tossed-out material." [...] Andrew Barker of Variety said, [...] "Among the slackest, laziest, least movie-like movies released by a major studio in the last decade, [...] "Grown Ups 2" [...] is perhaps the closest Hollywood has yet come to making Ow! My Balls! seem like a plausible future project." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film one out of four stars, saying, [...] "The temptation arises to say something nice about [...] "Grown Ups 2" [...] just because it doesn't cause injury. But no, it's a bad movie, just old-school bad, the kind that's merely lousy and not an occasion for migraines or night sweats." [...] Linda Barnard of the Toronto Star gave the film zero out of four stars, saying, [...] "Adam Sandler scrapes the bottom of the barrel—and then he pukes into it—with Grown Ups 2, a lazily cribbed-together swamp of pointless and unfunny sketches that makes 2010’s Grown Ups look like Citizen Kane." [...] <b>Matt</b> <b>Patches</b> of Time Out New York gave the film one out of five stars, saying, [...] "In the first five minutes, a deer walks into the star's bedroom and urinates on his face. It's all downhill from there." ...|$|R
5000|$|Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, saying [...] "Beyond a few chuckle-worthy one-liners and some amusing visual comedy, there's {{not much to}} engage adults, although the wee ones should be distracted enough." [...] <b>Matt</b> <b>Patches</b> of Time Out New York gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "Patient Adult Smurfs will be checking their watches as Excitable Child Smurfs lose themselves in the high jinks." [...] Frank Lovece of Newsday gave the film two out of four stars, saying [...] "Not Smurftastic, but not Smurfawful, either." [...] Loren King of The Boston Globe gave the film two out of four stars, saying [...] "That the mushroom- dwelling blue creatures still manage to be endearing even in their second big-screen extravaganza (in 3-D, no less) is about the best {{that can be said}} of [...] "Smurfs 2." [...] Kyle Smith of the New York Post gave the film one out of four stars, saying [...] "They're as lethally uninteresting as Barney the Purple Dinosaur, though a Godzilla-style [...] "Barney vs. Smurfs" [...] is a movie I would pay to see, provided maximum destruction were promised." [...] Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times gave the film {{two and a half stars}} out of five, saying [...] "Right down to the brute functionality of its title, [...] "The Smurfs 2" [...] may be the platonic ideal of a major studio sequel - no markedly better or worse than the first and with just enough difference to lay claim to being something new." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jocelyn Noveck of the Associated Press {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four stars, saying [...] "Your {{enjoyment}} will probably depend on your tolerance of those countless food-based puns dreamed up by script writers Erica Rivinoja, John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein. Some might find these tiresome, but let's just note here that this is a kid movie, and KIDS LOVE PUNS. So they laugh at 'There's a leek in the boat.' And they laugh even more the second time." [...] A.A. Dowd of The A.V. Club gave the film a C, saying [...] "Like too many sequels, this second helping of Meatballs confuses bigger for better, piling on the action but misplacing much of the original's charm." [...] David Hiltbrand of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying [...] "This scrumptious sequel follows the same recipe as the 2009 original." [...] Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film two out of four stars, saying [...] "Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 is a humorous yet unfocused romp, so unwilling to settle on a single theme that hyperactivity medication should be handed out with the 3-D glasses." [...] <b>Matt</b> <b>Patches</b> of Film.com gave the film 7.1 out of 10, saying [...] "The 2009 original separated itself from the Pixar and Dreamworks competition with a joke-first approach. The sequel quadruples the recipe, with gags on top of gags on top of gags in a way only animation could achieve. Like a foodie Jurassic Park conjured up by Tex Avery, Cloudy 2 is a sight to behold ... as long as your brain hasn't turned to mush by the halfway point." ...|$|R
5000|$|Critics were {{generally}} less enthusiastic. Lindy West in The Guardian {{described it as}} [...] "153 minutes of a grown man whacking two dolls together", asking [...] "(h)as the definition of 'movie' changed from 'motion picture story that a human wrote on purpose' to '700 only tangentially related 12-second grey and red vignettes'?" [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote: [...] "The point of Batman v Superman isn't fun, and it isn't thinking, either. It's obedience. The theology is invoked ... to buttress a spectacle of power. And in that way the film serves {{as a metaphor for}} its own aspirations. The corporations that produce movies like this one, and the ambitious hacks who sign up to make them, have no evident motive beyond their own aggrandizement." [...] Writing in The Telegraph, Robbie Collin called the film [...] "humourless" [...] and [...] "the most incoherent blockbuster in years". Cynthia Fuchs of PopMatters said, [...] "As you’re watching this movie, you might also contemplate your own part, in being swayed into consuming so much of what you’ve consumed before." [...] Adding, [...] "Wonder Woman’s remains Batman v Superman‘s most compelling story, precisely because it’s untold." [...] <b>Matt</b> <b>Patches</b> of Thrillist wrote [...] "what Batman v Superman can do, it does, at the cost of coherency and thrills. The movie is bat-shit crazy. A dour, disdainful demeanor, plus a gluttony of complex plot twists, dissipates most of the contact high." [...] Michael Philips of Chicago Tribune wrote, [...] "A near-total drag, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice plays like a loose, unofficial quarter-billion-dollar remake of The Odd Couple, in which Oscar and Felix are literally trying to kill each other." [...] On his podcast Hollywood Babble-On, film director Kevin Smith, a long-time friend and collaborator of Affleck, praised Affleck's performance but panned the film, commenting that it [...] "didn't really have a heart" [...] and was [...] "humorless", arguing that [...] "there seems to be a fundamental lack of understanding of what those characters are about. It's almost like Zack Snyder didn’t read a bunch of comics, he read one comic once, and it was The Dark Knight Returns, and his favorite part was the last part where Batman and Superman fight." [...] On a second viewing, however, Smith via his Instagram lightened his stance. Jeremy Irons expressed displeasure with the film, feeling it was [...] "deservedly so" [...] savaged by critics and calling the feature [...] "very muddled" [...] while expressing hope that the forthcoming Justice League (2017) would be better due to its story being [...] "...a lot smaller, it's more linear".|$|R
