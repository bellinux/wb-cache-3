5|$|Krohn's {{research}} {{also notes that}} Hitchcock shot the scene with two cameras: one a BNC Mitchell, the other a handheld French Éclair camera which Orson Welles had used in Touch of Evil (1958). In order to create an ideal montage for the greatest emotional impact on the audience, Hitchcock shot a lot of footage of this scene which he trimmed down in the editing room. He even brought a <b>Moviola</b> on the set to gauge the footage required. The final sequence, which his editor George Tomasini worked on with Hitchcock's advice, however did not go far beyond the basic structural elements set up by Bass' storyboards.|$|E
25|$|A <b>Moviola</b> is {{a device}} that allows a film editor to view film while editing. It was the first machine for motion picture editing in order to study {{individual}} shots in their cutting rooms that determine where the best cut-point might be. The vertically oriented Moviolas were the standard for film editing in the United States until the 1970s when horizontal flatbed editor systems became more common. In 1924, the <b>Moviola</b> was invented in the United States by Dutch-American Iwan Serrurier.|$|E

Rocketeer director Joe Johnston previously worked as an art director/model maker at ILM before his film directing career took off. Johnston's insistence on a realistic flying rocketman led ILM to devise a lifelike Cliff Secord model that was filmed in [...] "stop-motion-animation" [...] coupled with an 18" [...] figurine that was manipulated by hand and in [...] "go-motion" [...] to create [...] "motion-blur." [...] Speeded-up <b>Moviola</b> effects were also used to advantage in the air circus sequence where a combination of live action and stop-motion animation was also employed.|$|E

500|$|A {{total of}} [...] was shot for the film. According to editor John D. Dunning, the first {{cut of the}} film was four and {{one-half}} hours long. William Wyler stated that {{his goal was to}} bring the running time down to three and a half hours. The most difficult editing decisions, according to Dunning, came during scenes which involved Jesus Christ, as these contained almost no dialogue and most of the footage was purely reaction shots by actors. Dunning also believed that in the final cut the leper scene was too long and needed trimming. Editing was also complicated by the 70mm footage being printed. Because no editing equipment (such as the <b>Moviola)</b> existed which could handle the 70mm print, the 70mm footage would be reduced to 35mm and then cut. This caused much of the image to be lost. When the film was edited into its final form, it ran 213 minutes and included just [...] of film. It was the third-longest motion picture ever made at the time, behind Gone With The Wind and The Ten Commandments.|$|E

Although her screen {{test for the}} role in black-and-white was superb, she photographed poorly in Technicolor. Selznick also reportedly believed that at age 36, she {{was too old to}} play Scarlett, who is 16 {{at the beginning of the}} film (the role eventually went to Vivien Leigh). Selznick sent Kay Brown to Bankhead to discuss the possibility of Bankhead playing prostitute Belle Watling in the film, which she turned down. The search for Scarlett O'Hara was documented in [...] "The Scarlet O'Hara Wars" [...] episode of the miniseries <b>Moviola,</b> where the very similar Carrie Nye played Bankhead, being nominated for an Emmy Award.|$|E
2500|$|Carpenter {{edited the}} film using the {{pseudonym}} John T. Chance, {{the name of}} John Wayne's character in Rio Bravo. Debra Hill acted as an uncredited assistant editor. According to Carpenter, the editing process was very bare bones. One mistake Carpenter was not proud of was one shot [...] "cut out of frame," [...] which means the cut is made within the frame so a viewer can see it. Assault was shot on Panavision, which takes up the entire negative, and edited on <b>Moviola,</b> which cannot show the whole image, so if a cut was made improperly (i.e., frame line not lined up properly) then one would cut a half of a sprocket into the film and [...] "cut out of frame," [...] as happened to Carpenter. In the end, {{it did not matter}} because he said [...] "It was so dark no one could see it, thank God!" ...|$|E
2500|$|According to editor John D.

A total of [...] was shot for the film. William Wyler said {{his goal was to}} bring the running time down to three and a half hours. Editors Dunning and Winters saw their job as condensing the picture without losing any information or emotional impact. Dunning later said that he felt some of the leper colony sequence could have been cut. The most difficult editing decisions, he also said, came during scenes which involved Jesus Christ, as these contained almost no dialogue and most of the footage was purely reaction shots by actors. Editing was also complicated by the 70mm footage being printed. [...] Because no editing equipment (such as the <b>Moviola)</b> existed which could handle the 70mm print, the 70mm footage would be reduced to 35mm and then cut. This caused much of the image to be lost, and according to Dunning [...] "you didn't even know what you had until you cut the negative. We'd print up the 70 now and then, and project it to see what we were getting against what we were seeing in the 35. We really did it blind." [...] When the film was edited into its final form, it ran 213 minutes and included just [...] of film. It was the third-longest motion picture ever made at the time, behind Gone With The Wind and The Ten Commandments.|$|E

5000|$|Iwan Serrurier's {{original}} 1917 {{concept for}} the <b>Moviola</b> {{was as a}} home movie projector {{to be sold to}} the general public. The name was derived from the name [...] "Victrola" [...] since Serrurier thought his invention would do for home movie viewing what the Victrola did for home music listening. However, since the machine cost $600 in 1920 (equivalent to $20,000 in the 2000s), very few sold. An editor at Douglas Fairbanks Studios suggested that Iwan should adapt the device for use by film editors. Serrurier did this and the <b>Moviola</b> as an editing device was born in 1924 with the first <b>Moviola</b> being sold to Douglas Fairbanks himself. Ninety four years later, a framed copy of the original receipt still resides at <b>Moviola,</b> the company, in Hollywood.|$|E

This provision of suitable equipment is very important as many venues do not have high quality projection and sound equipment.
