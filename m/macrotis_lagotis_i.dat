50|$|Living in hot, {{semi-arid}} environments, {{the golden}} bandicoot is well adapted to keeping cool. Indeed, {{it is one}} of only two extant bandicoot species that are especially suited for arid environments, the other one being the bilby (<b>Macrotis</b> <b>lagotis).</b> Measurements in the laboratory show that the golden bandicoot has a low body temperature that is constantly changing; in this sense it is heterothermic. This allows the internal body temperature to fluctuate in response to extreme environmental temperatures without inhibiting and denaturing necessary proteins. Additionally, it has a low basal metabolic rate, low thermal conductance, and low rate of evaporative water loss. A low metabolic rate correlates to less heat being produced by the body, and a low thermal conductance does not allow the golden bandicoot to capture and store heat well. A highly efficient panting mechanism allows for a low rate of evaporative water loss when cooling the body, conserving precious water. This is an indispensable advantage in arid and dry environments.|$|R
40|$|Since European settlement, the {{distribution}} of the greater bilby (<b>Macrotis</b> <b>lagotis),</b> an omnivorous peramelid marsupial, has contracted into the driest and least fertile parts of its former range. A review of the dietary, metabolic and digestive strategies used by M. lagotis provides the basis for an explanation of its ability to persist in the arid regions where it is now restricted. M. lagotis utilises an opportunistic feeding strategy, selecting dietary items in accordance with their abundance. Termites, ants and seeds, that form a concentrated food source, are prevalent in their diet. In captivity, M. lagotis exhibits a flexible digestive strategy that enables them to use diets of varying nutritional value. However, the absence of a colonic separation mechanism in the hindgut suggests that they are limited to relatively low-fibre diets, and this is reflected in their diet in the field. The low water and maintenance nitrogen requirements of M. lagotis are consistent with arid habitation, but the field metabolic rate is higher than expected for an arid-zone mammal, which suggests that water rather than energy conservation is a priority for this species...|$|R

40|$|The diets of re-introduced {{populations of}} the greater bilby (<b>Macrotis</b> <b>lagotis)</b> and {{burrowing}} bettong (Bettongia lesueur) were compared in arid South Australia. Scats were collected during five sampling periods over 15 months and dietary items were usually identified to species or genus level using macro and micro-histological techniques. Both species consumed {{a wide variety of}} food items but M. lagotis exhibited a greater use of invertebrate material and B. lesueur consumed more roots and perennial vegetation. Both species consumed a variety of seeds. There was high seasonal variation in the diets of both species and they appeared to be opportunistic dietary generalists, a condition beneficial for survival in the unpredictable arid zone climate. Although both species consumed items from the same broad dietary categories there was little dietary overlap of specific food items. Where overlap existed it was either temporally separated or comprised less than 19 % of the total dietary volume suggesting a degree of resource partitioning between the two species. Whilst M. lagotis appears to have adapted to arid conditions by moving to follow ephemeral growth, B. lesueur is more sedentary and relies more on perennial vegetation. Within re-introduced confined populations where species movement is limited, M. lagotis may be more susceptible to population decline when conditions are dry, whereas B. lesueur may cause significant damage to perennial vegetation before experiencing population decline.

In this study, we evaluated {{this issue in}} a threatened Australian marsupial, the greater bilby (<b>Macrotis</b> <b>lagotis).</b> Fresh (< 12 h since defaecation) faecal samples (n = 19 pellets per bilby) were collected one morning from seven adult bilbies kept in captivity. One control faecal sample (Day 1) from each bilby was immediately frozen. The remaining faecal pellets were randomly positioned outdoors. Subsequently, we froze one faecal pellet every 24 h for 19 days. FCM levels in bilby faeces were quantified using an enzyme-immunoassay. Mean FCM levels showed variation (daily mean coefficients of variation [CV %]) of 56. 83 - 171. 65 % over 19 days. Overall, FCM levels were affected by exposure time; however, multiple comparisons showed that no significant change in FCM occurred after environmental exposure (no significant difference in mean FCM between control (Day 1) {{with any of the}} exposure days (Days 2 - 19). Individuals and sex also affected FCM levels. We found no correlation between mean daily CVs with daily minimum-maximum temperatures or rainfall.

Estimates of population parameters, including survival and fecundity, dispersal rate and home range size, were derived from a bilby reintroduction programme con-ducted in central Australia, as were parameters describ-ing environmental quality and the impact of fire, drought and sporadic large rainfa,!l events. The modelling results indicated that local segregation of a population to achieve replication did not change extinc-tion risk dramatically and that an experiment for a 2 -year duration (equivalent to a generation time) could be achieved at low risk with a small population. Adult mor-tality was of key importance in determining population survival. With the release of 12 individuals, drought and sporadic high rainfall events limited the life of the reintro-duced population to a median of 8 years. In the absence of these events, median extinction time was extended to 26 years. The modelling indicated that there was little scope to reduce nvironmental variation (and improve the popula-tion survival prospects) through manipulation or manage-ment of the environment.

Comparative dissections of the hind limb of the southern brown bandicoot Isoodon obesulus fusciventer (n = 8) and greater bilby <b>Macrotis</b> <b>lagotis</b> (n= 4) provide an interesting study in the adaptation of soft-tissues in the Peramelemorphia. Bilby hind limb muscle anatomy appeared relatively unspecialised; the arrangement and development of muscles was as expected for a syndactylous marsupial with moderately long, slender limb bones, a semi-flexed stance and an unspecialised digitigrade gait. In contrast, I. obesulus displayed significant modification of the muscular anatomy and associated connective tissues of the hind limb, which appear to reflect adaptation for rapid acceleration and locomotion, including strongly flexed limb posture, long muscle bellies with very short tendons, and extreme development of fascial structures. Differences between the hind limb anatomy of the bandicoot and bilby appear likely to reflect the different ecological and environmental pressures on their locomotor strategy.

40|$|Bandicoots and bilbies (Peramelemorphia) {{represent}} a distinct lineage within the marsupial adaptive radiation, which despite several curious anatomical traits has received little morphological attention. Many bandicoot species (family Peramelidae) dig for subterranean food, while bilbies (family Thylacomyidae) employ their forelimbs to dig extensive burrow systems for shelter. In the current study, dissections {{of the southern}} brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus) (n≤ 7) and greater bilby (<b>Macrotis</b> <b>lagotis)</b> (n≤ 4) provide the first anatomical descriptions of forelimb musculature in these species. The anatomical arrangement of forelimb muscles in I. obesulus and M. lagotis {{differs from that of}} other marsupials and corresponds to the aclaviculate pectoral girdle and modified arrangement of digits in the study species. Comparative and functional interpretations indicate that the forelimb of I. obesulus is well equipped for scratch digging and demonstrates muscular modifications in order to generate large out-forces. The bones of the forelimb, and in particular the antebrachium, are relatively short, stout bones, improving both their resistance to mechanical forces and providing a mechanical advantage via a reduced out-lever length. There has been an increase in the absolute volume of muscles employed during digging, thereby increasing the magnitude of the in-force. Increased in-lever lengths have been achieved via the migration of muscle insertions, including the elongate olecranon for the insertion of the m. triceps brachii, and the distal migration of the humeral attachments of the teres major, latissimus dorsi and superficial pectoral muscles...|$|R

At large spatial scales, soil disturbance by echidnas (Tachyglossus aculeatus) and Gould 2 ̆ 7 s sand goannas (Varanus gouldii) was substantially greater in communities dominated by shrubs, and where domestic livestock had been excluded. Heteromyid rodents tended to excavate more foraging pits in coarse-textured vegetation communities (both grasslands and shrublands). In both environments, foragingwas concentrated close to perennial plants such as grass tussocks and tree canopies rather than in the interspaces. Foraging pits of Chihuahuan desert animals tended to be higher in labile carbon and support greater levels of infiltration, though this was plant community-dependent.

40|$|Habitat {{loss and}} {{fragmentation}} has created metapopulations {{where there were}} once continuous populations. Ecologists and conservation biologists have become interested in the optimal way to manage and conserve such metapopulations. Several authors have considered the effect of patch disturbance and recovery on metapopulation persistence, but almost all such studies assume that every patch is equally susceptible to disturbance. We investigated the influence of protecting patches from disturbance on metapopulation persistence, and used a stochastic metapopulation model to answer the question: How can we optimally trade off returns from protection of patches vs. creation of patches? We considered the problem of finding, under budgetary constraints, the optimal combination of {{increasing the number of}} patches in the metapopulation network vs. increasing the number of protected patches in the network. We discovered that the optimal trade-off is dependent upon all of the properties of the system: the species dynamics, the dynamics of the landscape, and the relative costs of each action. A stochastic model and accompanying methodology are provided allowing a manager to determine the optimal policy for small metapopulations. We also provide two approximations, including a rule of thumb, for determining the optimal policy for larger metapopulations. The method is illustrated with an example inspired by information for the greater bilby, <b>Macrotis</b> <b>lagotis,</b> inhabiting southwestern Queensland, Australia.

In situ populations of Australia's iconic marsupial, the greater bilby (<b>Macrotis</b> <b>lagotis),</b> are nearing extinction due to the impacts of competition and predation by feral animals and unpredictable climatic events (summer heat waves). In this study, we focussed our aim to identify a non-invasive method to measure adrenal activity in the species and also to identify potential factors {{that should be considered}} when comparing physiological stress in semi-free ranging populations of the species. We validated an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for detecting fecal cortisol metabolites (FCM) from fresh fecal pellets taken from bilbies within four captive sites and two semi-free ranging populations around Queensland and New South Wales, Australia. Our FCM EIA successfully detected the 'raise and fall' pattern of FCM levels within 3 days of exogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge. Mean FCM levels differed significantly between the captive sites and between sexes. All male bilbies grouped outdoor in captivity expressed the highest mean FCM level in comparison to all captive males that were housed individually or as groups indoors. Also, semi-free ranging bilbies expressed higher mean FCM levels than the captive bilbies. Overall, our study successfully validated a non-invasive tool for monitoring physiological stress in the greater bilby.

40|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{programs are}} increasingly {{being used as a}} management option for threatened mammals. The greater bilby <b>Macrotis</b> <b>lagotis,</b> for example, is a vulnerable species which is maintained in captivity at several facilities in Australia. Non-invasive evaluation of stress hormones (cortisol in mammals) via excretory metabolites can be used to monitor physiological stress responses of captive individuals. In this study, we validated an enzyme-immunoassay (EIA) to measure cortisol metabolites in fresh faecal samples of adult male and female bilbies (n = 7) held in captivity at the Dreamworld Theme Park, Queensland, Australia. The faecal cortisol EIA was validated via parallelism and the recovery of exogenous cortisol added to pooled faecal extracts (> 99 % recovery). Female bilbies had higher average faecal cortisol metabolite concentrations and higher day-to-day variation than male bilbies; however, there was no relationship with bilby age. Cortisol metabolites for most individuals varied widely through time, with numerous peaks and troughs in response to long-term stressors (illnesses, injury and reproductive issues) and short-term stressors, such as use in shows at Dreamworld or public displays in local schools, manual restraint and short-term veterinary procedures (e. g. general anaesthesia). Overall, the higher mean cortisol metabolite concentrations of individuals suffering long-term stress was related to a greater response to short-term stressors. This suggests an interaction between responses to short-term and long-term stressors which is perhaps due to habituation and/or facilitation of long-term stressors. Non-invasive faecal monitoring of stress hormones could provide further information on the implications of captive breeding programs and the release of animals reared in captivity.

This was followed by the introduction of a male and a reproductive assessment through mating, gestation and early lactation. In the absence of a male, there was no cyclical pattern of urogenital cytology, pericloacal or pouch development, and progestogen concentrations remained basal. Within 5 days of the introduction of a male, all females had a karyopycnotic index of 100 %. Spermatozoa were present in the urogenital smear within 3 days of male introduction in all five females that gave birth. Five to 9 days after the introduction of a male, there was an increase in plasma progestogen concentration that remained elevated for 14 - 19 days. Six of the seven females gave birth approximately 3 days after reaching peak plasma progestogen concentrations. Gestation length ranged between 14 and 17 days. Plasma progestogen concentrations of the postpartum and early lactation period were lower (P < 0. 0001) than during gestation, but greater (P < 0. 0001) than those recorded before the introduction of a male. One female that gave birth early in the study that was examined until weaning of the pouch young showed a cyclical pattern of plasma progestogen secretion that ended at weaning. This study provides evidence that the luteal phase in the greater bilby is induced by the presence of a male.

We investigated whether tracks cleared for seismic surveys are preferentially used by predators and herbivores in a landscape inhabited by bilbies (<b>Macrotis</b> <b>lagotis),</b> a vulnerable species of conservation concern. We used a paired camera trap array to investigate the use of cleared seismic lines at four time points after clearing (1 month, 3 months, 7 months, 48 months) by six mammal species. Bilbies, cattle (Bos indicus/B. taurus), dingoes (Canis familiaris), feral cats (Felis catus) and agile wallabies (Macropus agilis) preferred to use seismic lines compared with adjacent undisturbed vegetation for almost all surveys, while spectacled hare wallabies (Lagorchestes conspicillatus) avoided them. Bilbies and agile wallabies showed similar temporal activity patterns on and off seismic lines but feral cats, dingoes and cattle used seismic lines at different times of day to control areas. We also investigated microhabitat selection by spool tracking individual bilbies. Bilbies selected a route through vegetation that was more open than surrounding vegetation. While spatial and temporal funnelling of bilbies and their predators (especially cats) may increase the frequency of encounter between the two, {{it is important to note}} that bilbies were active at significantly different times to predators both on and off seismic lines. The identified selection for seismic lines, and changes in spatial and temporal overlap between species, can be used to develop effective management strategies, to minimize potential impacts on native species...|$|R

Compared to a previous assessment of distribution, the extent of occurrence has changed little in the last 20 yr. However, the area of occupancy is small relative {{to the extent of}} occurrence and < 25 % of the current geographic range has bilby sign < 20 km apart. Generalised linear modelling was used to determine the strength of association between bilby occurrence and habitat variables and identify refugia characteristics. Four competing candidate models were examined to determine whether bilby occurrence associated significantly with productive substrates and introduced herbivores, the distribution of key predator species, the pattern of fire, and climatic gradients including rainfall and temperature. For the entire study area, bilby presence associated most strongly with variables of mean annual rainfall, substrate type and the probability of dingo occurrence. Proximity to recently burnt habitat formed a significant predictor of bilby occurrence in a model derived for a reduced part of the study area where most sign was found. The work suggested that the current frameworks underpinning understanding of biotic distributions in arid Australia are deficient, and that climatic gradients, lateritic and rocky systems, and predators need to be incorporated into our thinking in the future. The extent of occurrence based on outlier records from opportunistic reports provided a misleading indication of the true status of the bilby.

40|$|Browsing by {{introduced}} cattle (Bos taurus) {{and rabbits}} (Oryctolagus cuniculus) can limit {{the recruitment of}} some arid zone tree and shrub species. In a study conducted at the Arid Recovery Reserve, Roxby Downs, SA, we aimed to quantify initial recruitment changes in shrubs after the removal of cattle and rabbits and the re-introduction of locally extinct fauna. The presence and abundance of seedlings was measured at groves of seven native perennial shrubs over 6 years under four browsing treatments: (1) ‘reserve-reintroductions’ [re-introduced greater stick-nest rats (Leporillus conditor), burrowing bettongs (Bettongia lesueur) and greater bilbies (<b>Macrotis</b> <b>lagotis)</b> ], (2) ‘reserve-no browsers’, (3) ‘pastoral-stocked’ (rabbits and cattle), and (4) ‘pastoral-destocked’ (rabbits). Recruitment of mulga (Acacia aneura F. Muell. ex Benth.), silver cassia (Senna artemisioides subsp. petiolaris Randell) and sandhill wattle (Acacia ligulata A. Cunn. ex Benth.) was significantly greater in the two browsing regimes inside the Reserve than in the two pastoral regimes. The number of recruits of these three species declined at ‘pastoral-destocked’ and ‘pastoral-stocked’ sites but increased at ‘reserve-reintroductions’ and ‘reserve-no browsers’ sites from 2001 to 2006. Narrow-leaf hopbush (Dodonaea viscose (L.) Jacq.) showed a trend towards increased recruitment at sites in both browsing regimes inside the Reserve, but decreased recruitment at sites in both pastoral regimes. Native plum (Santalum lanceolatum R. Br.), native apricot (Pittosporum phylliraeoides orth. var. DC.) and bullock bush (Alectryon oleifolius (Desf.) S. T. Reynolds) exhibited {{no significant difference in}} recruitment between the four browsing regimes within the study timeframe. These results suggest that excluding rabbits and stock may benefit the germination and survival of mulga, silver cassia and sandhill wattle. To date, re-introduced native herbivores at low numbers have not been found to negatively affect the recruitment or growth rate of the seven perennial plant species studied. Nicola T.

40|$|Habitat modifying {{species can}} play crucial roles in {{ecosystem}} function. Invasive engineers may assume these roles where native engineers {{have been lost}} from the system. We compared {{the dynamics of the}} foraging pits of an invasive engineer, the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) with two native mammals, the greater bilby (<b>Macrotis</b> <b>lagotis)</b> and the burrowing bettong (Bettongia lesueur). Foraging pits are small surface depressions created by animals when they forage for seeds, bulbs, roots, invertebrates and fungi. We measured foraging pit density and turnover, and density and richness of plant seedlings in pits and adjacent surfaces across three landforms representing a gradient in resource availability inside (bilbies and bettongs), and outside (rabbits only) a reserve in an arid Australian shrubland over 2 years. Pits of the native engineers contained 80 % more seedlings (11. 2 plants m− 2) than rabbit pits (6. 22 plants m− 2). Further, rabbit pits supported 3. 6 -times fewer seedlings than equivalent non-pit surfaces outside the exclosure. Only one plant species was restricted entirely to pits. The reserve had more foraging pits and greater turnover than outside, but contrary to prediction, pit effects on seedling density were no greater in the more resource-limited dunes. There were some strong temporal and landscape effects on pit density and species composition, but generally trends were similar inside and outside the reserve. Overall, despite their functional similarities, invasive rabbits created fewer pits that were less favourable patches for seedlings than those of native engineers. Our work suggests that a suite of ecosystem processes associated with fertile patch creation has potentially been lost with the extirpation of bilbies and bettongs. Alex I. James, David J.

40|$|CSIRO 2006 This study uses {{analysis}} of faecal pellets {{to assess the}} diet of the bilby (<b>Macrotis</b> <b>lagotis)</b> in an area spanning over 230 000 km 2 in the Tanami Desert, Northern Territory. More specifically, we examine the link between diet composition, bilby prevalence and the landscape variables of fire, rainfall and substrate. Seed promoted by fire, particularly of Yakirra australiense, {{was found to be}} one of the most important components of the diet and constituted ~ 36 % of the relative abundance of identifiable food particles. Bulb from Cyperus bulbosus was also an important component of the diet (18. 5 % relative abundance). Invertebrates accounted for 39 % of the identifable food particles, and termites and beetles were the most common types. Bulb and seed formed a greater component of the diet in the central part of the study area where bilbies were more prevalent. Conversely, invertebrates were more dominant in the bilby diet on the northern and southern periphery of the Tanami Desert. Substrate type and antecedent rainfall associated significantly with the amount of seed from fire-promoted plants and total plant contained in the diet. Time since fire was an additional factor associated with the abundance of dietary fire-promoted seed. This suggests that the spatial and temporal variability of these landscape variables play an important role in controlling the availability of seed and bulb resources used by the bilby, and thus affect bilby prevalence. The results support the proposition that seed and bulb plant foods are exploited opportunistically and invertebrates, especially termites, are relied upon when plant food resources are scarce. Furthermore, the findings indicate that fire management could be used as a means to increase the favourability of habitat for the bilby in parts of its current range. Richard Southgate and Susan M.

40|$|The greater bilby, <b>Macrotis</b> <b>lagotis,</b> is {{a species}} of {{conservation}} significance in the arid and semiarid zones of Australia. A species recovery program has been underway since the mid- 1990 s but the incorporation of molecular genetic data within {{the program has been}} difficult due to the problems of obtaining regular, population-wide samples of this trap-shy and sparsely distributed species. In this study, we demonstrate that faecal pellets collected from around burrows in the dry, arid habitat of western Queensland provide a viable source for DNA extraction and analysis. Faecal DNA was used to generate population-level estimates of microsatellite and mtDNA diversity for comparison with previous estimates for the natural population derived from tissue samples. Data were used to assess both the reliability of faecal-derived genotypes and the extent of any diversity loss since the previous study. Microsatellite diversity recorded from eight polymorphic markers for the natural population (A = 4. 31 ᠰ. 30, HE = 0. 76 ᠰ. 03) was comparable with the previous study, indicating little change in genetic diversity for the natural population in the 10 -year interim. Faecal genotypes generated for the recently reintroduced population matched the known number of founders as well as a known genotype, providing support for the reliability of the faecal DNA approach. The captive and reintroduced populations had significantly lower diversity levels than the natural population (A = 3. 59 ᠰ. 28, HE = 0. 68 ᠰ. 03; A = 3. 57 ᠰ. 20, HE = 0. 65 ᠰ. 03 respectively). Mitochondrial control region analysis, incorporating nested clade phylogeographic analysis (NCPA), agrees with earlier findings that populations of bilbies across the arid zone in Australia have only recently become fragmented, but the case for Queensland bilbies being strongly differentiated from other regions is diminished. Implications from this study include the need to further supplement the captive and reintroduced populations with additional out-bred individuals and that faecal DNA can be used effectively for ongoing monitoring and management of this species.

40|$|In arid landscapes limited {{resources}} are concentrated into fertile patches that allow greater productivity than {{would otherwise be}} expected. Fertile patches are created and maintained by processes that modify soil topography and interrupt the flow of resources across the landscape. These processes may be abiotic or biotic in origin. Species that modify, maintain or create habitat have been termed ecosystem engineers. One group of soil disturbing ecosystem engineers creates fertile patches by modifying soil microtopography through foraging for food and creating habitat. This thesis examines the effects of soil foraging animals on resource concentration in arid environments and how effects are moderated by species and landscape. Chapter 1 {{provides an overview of}} the importance of fertile patches in arid systems and describes previous research on the effects of ecosystem engineers in arid environments. Chapter 2 examines how fertile patch creation by a well-studied arid zone engineer, the ant, varies between ant species and landforms, demonstrating that while we can generalise about the effects of ant nests on water flow and nutrient levels, differences in soil type, nest density and ant species across sites are likely to moderate these effects. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 compare the engineering effects of reintroduced native species, the Greater bilby (<b>Macrotis</b> <b>lagotis)</b> and Burrowing bettong (Bettongia lesueur) with the Sand goanna (Varanus gouldii) and the invasive European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) across three Australian landforms, revealing differences between reintroduced and invasive engineers at the both patch and landscape scales. At the landscape scale, differences in pit densities and resource concentration in foraging pits between landforms suggest that fertile patch development is not uniform. Chapter 6 examines whether the structure of the pit or the presence of litter per se explains observed increases in plant germination in foraging pits, and compares temperature and soil moisture conditions in bilby and bettong pits to the soil surface. Chapter 7 is a review that builds upon previous chapters, published and unpublished literature of the potential for reintroductions of ecosystem engineers to restore ecosystem function in degraded environments. Chapter 8 summarises the research presented in this thesis and its implications, and suggests directions for future work...|$|R
40|$|Leaf litter is an {{important}} resource and a fundamental component of all terrestrial ecosystems. The senescence and decay of leaves, bark and other organic material provides a mechanism for carbon, nitrogen and other critical elements to be transported and incorporated into the soil. This process is particularly important in arid and semi-arid ecosystems where resources are limited and unevenly distributed spatially and temporally. There are many drivers that modulate surface litter accumulation, litter fall rates and litter decay rates. This thesis examines how these aspects of litter dynamics are moderated by abiotic (e. g. soil, landform, fire, rainfall) and biotic (e. g. vegetation communities, individual species) factors in semi-arid woodlands and shrublands in eastern Australia. Chapter 1 {{provides an overview of}} the importance of litter in semi-arid woodlands, describing previous research on leaf litter dynamics in arid and semi&# 150;arid ecosystems. Chapter 2 examines litter fall rates in response to abiotic conditions, with a focus on the fall rates of reproductive structures (seeds, flowers and fruits) from three species that differ in their life histories. Chapter 3 and 4 focus on the accumulation and spatial arrangement of surface litter. Chapter 3 describes the shift in litter bed size and composition under two Eucalypt Mallee species (Eucalyptus socialis, E. dumosa) along a 42 year chronosequence of fire histories. Chapter 4 examines properties of spatial self-organisation exhibited by litter patches, assessing litter patch cover, size and degree of spatial association between surface litter and perennial vegetation across four different landscapes. Chapters 5 and 6 focus on aspects and implications of litter decomposition in the foraging pits of mammals. Chapter 5 examines the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors during the decomposition process of substrates in the foraging pits of short-beaked echidnas (Tachyglossus aculeatus), greater bilbies (<b>Macrotis</b> <b>lagotis)</b> and burrowing bettongs (Bettongia lesueur). Chapter 6 examines the conditions under which litter decomposition in echidna foraging pits facilitates seedling growth by assessing water stress and the proximity of foraging pits to large trees. Chapter 7 is a summation of the previous chapters, highlighting the implications and limitations of these novel studies, and providing direction for future work in this field...|$|R
