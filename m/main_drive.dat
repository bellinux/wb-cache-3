5|$|The {{campaign}} subsequently {{developed into}} three separate drives by the Australians, who fanned {{out from the}} main Allied base at Torokina: in the north, centre and southern parts of the island. The first actions were fought around the seizure of Pearl Ridge in late December 1944 to secure control of the east–west avenues of approach across the island, and to prevent any possible Japanese counter-attacks against Torokina. This was followed by actions in the north, where it was planned that Japanese forces would be forced into the narrow Bonis Peninsula and contained, while the <b>main</b> <b>drive</b> {{took place in the}} south, where the main Japanese forces were concentrated, with an initial drive towards Mosigetta, followed by an advance towards Buin on the coast. The drive south subsequently resulted in several actions around Slater's Knoll and around the Hongorai River.|$|E
5|$|The third {{source of}} over-provisioning comes from known free {{space on the}} drive, gaining {{endurance}} and performance {{at the expense of}} reporting unused portions, and/or at the expense of current or future capacity. This free space can be identified by the operating system using the TRIM command. Alternately, some SSDs provide a utility that permit the end user to select additional over-provisioning. Furthermore, if any SSD is set up with an overall partitioning layout smaller than 100% of the available space, that unpartitioned space will be automatically used by the SSD as over-provisioning as well. Yet another source of over-provisioning is operating system minimum free space limits; some operating systems maintain a certain minimum free space per drive, particularly on the boot or <b>main</b> <b>drive.</b> If this additional space can be identified by the SSD, perhaps through continuous usage of the TRIM command, then this acts as semi-permanent over-provisioning. Over-provisioning often takes away from user capacity, either temporarily or permanently, but it gives back reduced write amplification, increased endurance, and increased performance.|$|E
5|$|An Allied council met on 1 December {{to discuss}} {{proposals}} for the battle. Most of the Allied strategists had two fundamental ideas in mind: making {{contact with the}} enemy and securing the southern flank that held the communication line to Vienna. Although the Tsar and his immediate entourage pushed hard for a battle, Emperor Francis of Austria was more cautious and, as mentioned, he was seconded by Kutuzov, the Commander-in-chief of the Russians and the Allied troops. The pressure to fight from the Russian nobles and the Austrian commanders, however, was too strong, and the Allies adopted the plan of the Austrian Chief-of-Staff, Franz von Weyrother. This called for a <b>main</b> <b>drive</b> against the French right flank, which the Allies noticed was lightly guarded, and diversionary attacks against the French left. The Allies deployed most of their troops into four columns that would attack the French right. The Russian Imperial Guard was held in reserve while Russian troops under Bagration guarded the Allied right. The Russian Tsar rudely stripped the authority of Commander-in-chief M. I. Kutuzov {{and gave it to}} Franz von Weyrother. In the battle, Kutuzov could only command the IV Corps of the Allied army, although he was still the de facto commander because the Tsar was afraid to take over in case his favoured plan failed.|$|E

25|$|Three new {{sections}} {{were laid out}} for burial in 1895. The hydrants installed in 1890 were all replaced after they unexpectedly deteriorated, and both fountains had to be repaired and their leaking basins cemented. The fencing was also proving problematic. The 1883 fencing along the east, west, and north sides was in disrepair and needed painting. The Woodland Avenue fencing, installed in 1877, was completely replace after the sidewalk was regraded and lowered. The cemetery's <b>Main</b> <b>Drive,</b> which had been macadamized some years earlier, was now impassable after spring and fall rains.

25|$|Normally the {{steering}} shaft {{is connected to}} the engine directly, instead of the output from the transmission. This means it spins at a relatively narrow range of RPM compared to the <b>main</b> <b>drive</b> shaft. The steering shaft is split into two output shafts through a clutch system that allows the outputs to spin forward, backward, or not at all. An idler reverses the direction on one side, so they always spin in opposite directions.|$|E

25|$|The {{university}} {{is located on}} the site of one of California's 36 original adobes, built in 1776 by Franciscan missionaries and destroyed by fire in 1908. These lands once were part of a Spanish land grant known as Rancho Rosa Castilla, given to Juan Batista Batz, a Basque rancher from northern Spain who settled here in the 1850s. The inspiration for the name of the rancho, according to local historians, was the wild roses that once grew near the ranch home. The <b>main</b> <b>drive</b> through the campus is known as Paseo Rancho Castilla, in acknowledgment of the university's historic heritage.|$|E
25|$|In the Flanders Campaign of 1794, the Coalition army {{made its}} <b>main</b> <b>drive</b> against the French center while the French {{attacked}} {{on the two}} flanks. The Coalition was successful at first but the French soon seized the initiative with persistent attacks. When the Coalition forces shifted east to defend {{the line of the}} Sambre River at the end of May, the left wing of Pichegru's Army of the North laid siege to Ypres.

25|$|The <b>main</b> <b>drive</b> against Elsenborn Ridge was {{launched}} in the forests east of the twin villages on the early morning of 17 December. This attack was begun by tank and Panzergrenadier units of the 12th SS Panzer Division. The 989th Infantry Regiment of the 277th succeeded, after heavy and costly combat in the woods, in overrunning the forward U.S. positions guarding the trails to the villages, capturing {{a large number of}} prisoners and leaving many small units isolated behind the front lines. By 11:00, this attack had driven units of the U.S. 99th Infantry Division back into the area of the twin villages. These units were joined by forces of the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division moving into the villages from the north. The German attack swiftly bogged down against the heavy small arms and machine gun fire from prepared positions of the American 99th Infantry Division on their flanks. The 990/277 and 991/277 Infantry Regiments had less success, struggling to get through the dense woods and heavy brush in their path.|$|E
25|$|Mehmed II's post-Constantinople {{troubles}} escalated further {{when the}} Balkan principality of Wallachia under Count Vlad III Dracul rebelled against the Ottoman Empire and declared the King of Hungary as his suzerain. The <b>main</b> <b>drive</b> for these actions was Vlad's {{return to his}} homeland after being in exile as a hostage of the Ottoman sultan. In 1461, five years after his return, Vlad initiated war with the Turks when he impaled the Turkish ambassadors demanding tribute from him and took the fortress of Giurgiu. Vlad then began a bloody assault across the Danube to the Black Sea, destroying {{as many of the}} ports as he could to prevent Ottoman naval attacks. Ottoman attempts to subdue Vlad militarily proved a failure, but his cruelty, which had terrorized his enemies, proved to be his undoing. When Mehmed offered the populace the choice of Vlad or his brother Radu, the populace chose Radu and soon Vlad was again an exile on the run. An attempt to return a few years afterwards ended in his death in battle.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} house that sits on them, the grounds too were {{transformed}} throughout the decades: Lady Byng created the existing rock garden, with a reflecting pool and wild corner for growing trilliums and orchids; a totem pole by Kwakiutl carver Mungo Martin was gifted to the Earl Alexander of Tunis by the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia-in-Council; the Fountain of Hope was initiated by Gerda Hnatyshyn to mark the International Year of Disabled Persons, built in front of Rideau Hall, and dedicated to Terry Fox; and an inukshuk by artist Kananginak Pootoogook, from Cape Dorset, Nunavut, was built to commemorate the second National Aboriginal Day, in 1997. The Canadian Heritage Garden is a formal rose garden championed by Gerda Hnatyshyn and constructed to mark the 125th anniversary of Confederation. Also, {{each member of the}} Royal Family or visiting dignitary to Rideau Hall is asked to plant a tree; as such, the park, mostly along the <b>main</b> <b>drive,</b> is dotted with nearly 100 trees with small plaques at their bases listing the name and office of the person who planted each particular tree.
