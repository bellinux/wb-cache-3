5|$|The Eriksson {{brothers}} and Johansson {{did not work}} <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> the game until 1984, when the journalist Erik Fichtelius conducted an interview about the game for the Swedish airline Linjeflyg's magazine Upp, which was distributed to all their airplanes in 1985. In the article, Fichtelius asked Johansson why they had not made the game commercially available for home computers; Johansson said {{that it had been}} considered but that they had only developed the game because it was a fun challenge for them, and {{that they would have to}} find a distributor of computer programs if they wanted to create a PC version.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was also}} positively received; for example, Hendrix from GamePro shared his {{opinion that the}} game did well with management of the games time. Nelson and Hendrix from IGN and GamePro both emphasized their enjoyment of the games action elements. GameSpot, while feeling that the action elements were {{the primary focus of}} the game, still liked the wide variety of role-playing elements present. Nelson from IGN, however, wished that the role-playing elements had been reduced even further in favor of the action parts of the game. All three reviewers compared the game to The Legend of Zelda, such as Mielke from GameSpot who had discussed the game to release as a direct competitor to that series. Both GameSpot and IGN felt that the comparison was invalid, as Musashi focused <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> action than role-playing, resulting in a game that was not a direct competitor at all.|$|E

25|$|From an {{economic}} standpoint, Cuba relies <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> Venezuela than Venezuela does on Cuba. As of 2012, Venezuela accounted for 20.8% of Cuba's GDP while Cuba only accounted for roughly 4% of Venezuela's. Because of this reliance, {{the most recent}} economic Crisis in Venezuela (2012-present), with inflation nearing 800% and GDP shrinking by 19% in 2016, Cuba is not receiving their amount of payment and heavily subsidized oil.

25|$|Watchdogs {{have accused}} Kaiser of abusing the power {{imbalance}} {{inherent in the}} arbitration system. Kaiser engages in many cases whereas a customer will usually engage in just one and Kaiser can reject any arbitrator unilaterally, thus they can select company-friendly arbitrators over those that rule in favor of customers. As a large organization, Kaiser can also afford to spend <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> lawyers and orators than the customer, giving them more advantages. In response to criticisms, Kaiser established an Office of Independent Administrators (OIA) in 1999 to oversee the arbitration process. The degree to which this office is actually independent has been questioned.|$|E

25|$|The {{encyclical}} Divino afflante Spiritu, {{published in}} 1943, emphasized {{the role of}} the Bible. Pius XII freed biblical research from previous limitations. He encouraged Christian theologians to revisit original versions of the Bible in Greek and Hebrew. Noting improvements in archaeology, the encyclical reversed Pope Leo XIII's encyclical, which had only advocated going back to the original texts to resolve ambiguity in the Latin Vulgate. The encyclical demands a much better understanding of ancient Jewish history and traditions. It requires bishops throughout the Church to initiate biblical studies for lay people. The Pontiff also requests a reorientation of Catholic teaching and education, relying <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> sacred scriptures in sermons and religious instruction.|$|E
25|$|In weightlessness, astronauts {{must rely}} <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> vision to {{maintain}} their spatial orientation, because the otolith organs can no longer signal the “down” direction. During prolonged exposure, however, reliance seems to shift toward an intrinsic, body vertical reference. The erroneous illusions of self-motion during head movements performed during and after return to Earth gravity are presumably due to a re-interpretation of vestibular inputs. Ground-based {{studies suggest that the}} CNS resolves the “tilt-translation” ambiguity based on the frequency content of the linear acceleration detected by the otolith organs, with low frequency indicating “tilt” and high frequency indicating “translation”. A crossover exists at about 0.3Hz where the otolith signals are then ambiguous. Exposure to weightlessness presumably results in a shift of this crossover frequency, which could then contribute to spatial disorientation and SMS.|$|E
25|$|Jesus' {{death and}} resurrection {{underpin}} a variety of theological interpretations as to how salvation is granted to humanity. These interpretations vary widely in how much emphasis they place {{on the death of}} Jesus as compared to his words. According to the substitutionary atonement view, Jesus' death is of central importance, and Jesus willingly sacrificed himself as an act of perfect obedience as a sacrifice of love which pleased God. By contrast the moral influence theory of atonement focuses <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> the moral content of Jesus' teaching, and sees Jesus' death as a martyrdom. Since the Middle Ages there has been conflict between these two views within Western Christianity. Evangelical Protestants typically hold a substitutionary view and in particular hold to the theory of penal substitution. Liberal Protestants typically reject substitutionary atonement and hold to the moral influence theory of atonement. Both views are popular within the Roman Catholic church, with the satisfaction doctrine incorporated into the idea of penance.|$|E

25|$|Miami International Airport (MIA) {{is one of}} {{the busiest}} {{airports}} in the United States in terms of total passenger traffic and cargo traffic, but {{especially when it comes to}} international traffic. It is considered to be the largest economic engine in Miami-Dade County, and has a large employee base. It was connected to the Metrorail system in 2012 via the only significant extension to the system in its history, the AirportLink that created the Orange Line, which most significantly led to higher service frequency in the southern portion of the existing Green Line. The connection is made at the Miami Airport Station through the MIA Mover people mover, and the station only sees about 1,500 passengers a day, much lower than many of the system's other stations. With headways cut in half, ridership rose <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> double-lined portion of the system from Earlington Heights to Dadeland South stations than the Airport Station itself. MIA has seen record growth in the 2010s, with the addition of many major international flights and carriers, though many are connecting flights, similar to Hartsfield Jackson, with Miami being a layover not a final destination.|$|E
25|$|However, Howard was {{defeated}} in 2007 and the Labor Party's Kevin Rudd defeated him and Rudd held the office until June 2010, when he was replaced {{as the leader of}} the party. Rudd used his term in office to symbolically ratify the Kyoto Protocol and led an historic parliamentary apology to the Stolen Generation (those Indigenous Australians who had been removed from their parents by the state during the early 20th century to the 1960s). The mandarin Chinese speaking former diplomat also pursued energetic foreign policy and initially sought to instigate a price on carbon, in the Australian economy to combat global warming but which he later reneged on. His prime ministership coincided with the initial phases of the Financial crisis of 2007–2010, to which his government responded quickly through a large package of economic stimulus—the management of which later proved to be controversial but effective in somewhat shielding Australia from the Great Recession but this was owed to a number of factors including the Mining Boom and Asia. The Rudd Government also finalised withdrawing troops from Iraq and focused <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> its relationship with Asia, the Government also tried to formalise an agreement to be made at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, but failed. The Government also embarked on a huge infrastructure project, which was to be fraught with trouble, the National Broadband Network (NBN), this project aims to lift average Australian internet speeds to be on par with the rest of the world, however the most major policy decision was the cancellation of the Howard Government's Pacific Solution, but as Kevin Rudd cancelled the arrangement, the number of boat arrivals swelled and the death toll rose, so in response to this, the Gillard Government created multiple different solutions, including proposing Malaysian resettlement, but eventually settling on Nauru, Manus Island and East Timor as refugee resettlement options.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] {{talks about}} females wanting to submissevely serve their male love {{interests}} {{and take care}} of them as they admire their hard work and are inspired by them. The trio further sings about the men of their lives {{and the way in which}} they will take care of them. [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] was written as a continuation on the previous song on Destiny Fulfilled, [...] "Soldier"; after the trio sings about finding a suitable lover in the aforementioned song, they express a will to cater to him in [...] "Cater 2 U". In the second edition of the book Introducing Cultural Studies, the authors argued that the song contained lyrics about objectification of women, which suggested that their gender role was to [...] "'keep herself up', 'keep it right', 'cater to' their man by providing him with his dinner, a foot rub, a manicure, fetching his slippers, and <b>much</b> <b>more,</b> <b>on</b> demand". An editor writing in The Times of India found a theme of feminine assertiveness in [...] "Cater 2 U"; he noted that [...] "the women come off not so much as lovers as full-service romantic servants". J. Freedom du Lac, a staff writer of The Washington Post wrote that the song's theme was supplication.|$|E

Rather, it involves secretly moving in and out of countries like Pakistan, Iran and Somalia where the American military is not legally allowed to operate.

2500|$|Some landowners {{have set}} aside {{some of their}} {{property}} as a reserve for the deer, as well as keeping cattle instead of sheep.
