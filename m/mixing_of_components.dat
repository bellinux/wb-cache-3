However, the total catch from each of these components cannot be estimated easily because the components mix during the summer feeding season. The spawning origin of herring is determined from patterns in the microstructure of the otolith core, from samples taken in the central and northern North Sea during summer of 2004 – 2007. The annual catch composition of Dutch vessels is determined within a statistical framework that takes account of the spatial patterns in mixing of spawning components and the classification success of the method. <b>Mixing</b> <b>of</b> <b>components</b> varied between years, with steep latitudinal gradients in compositions in some years, resulting in pronounced between-year differences in estimated catch compositions.

There is mass transport at a rate M(sub PD) by plumes from the lower mantle, a fraction of which is outgassed directly into the atmosphere, while the remainder feeds matter and associated nuclei into D. D is well outgassed at spreading centers and has material containing atmospheric gases added to it by subduction. In the case of He, there is no subduction component. The approach follows the treatment of Kellogg and Wasserburg. A summary of the pertinent equations and constraints was reported earlier. The U, Th and Pu in P are estimated for Earth models from refractory element abundances in meteorites. In this model the inventory of rare gases in D is governed by the simple <b>mixing</b> <b>of</b> <b>components</b> from P (both radiogenic and original) with distinctive atmospheric components.
