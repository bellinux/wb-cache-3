50|$|During the Korean War, the M1 bayonet and M1905 bayonet which {{mount to}} the M1, were proven {{difficult}} to remove with gloves on. As {{a result the}} U.S. M5 Garand bayonet was designed and issued in 1953. This was a total redesign based on the M4 bayonet used by the M1 carbine. The M5 bayonet looks nothing like the original M1905 or M1 bayonets for the M1 Garand. The M5 is the only U.S. bayonet without a barrel <b>mount</b> <b>ring</b> on the crossguard, making it {{look more like a}} fighting knife than a bayonet.|$|E
50|$|The EF-S-mount is a newer {{subset of}} the EF standard, {{introduced}} in 2003. EF-S lenses can only be used on Canon digital cameras that use the APS-C sensor, for example the 400D (EOS Digital Rebel XTi) and the 40D. EF-S lenses can be distinguished by a white dot on the <b>mount</b> <b>ring,</b> {{as opposed to the}} red dot seen on standard EF lenses. Note that while an EF-S lens cannot be mounted on a camera that uses the EF mount, EF lenses can be mounted on cameras designed for the EF-S standard: for this reason, EF-S cameras carry both a red dot and a white dot on the mount.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{mathematical}} model of static and dynamic {{calculation of the}} improved design of balancing device with the hydraulically unloaded resiliently <b>mounted</b> <b>ring</b> is represented in work. For the dynamic analysis of system {{it is necessary to}} consider the connected oscillations of resiliently <b>mounted</b> <b>ring</b> and disk of balancing device. For the improved design device rigidity of the disk is much more than rigidity of the resiliently <b>mounted</b> <b>ring.</b> Therefore at calculation of the balancing device special attention is to be paid to dynamic analysis of axially moving ring. The forced angular oscillations of ring, which are caused by a possible misalignment of the rotating disk, are also considered...|$|R
50|$|Starting in the 1930s, filters {{were also}} {{made in a}} sizing system known as a series mount. The filters {{themselves}} were round pieces of glass (or occasionally other materials) with no threads. Very early filters had no rims around the glass, but the more common later production filters had the glass mounted in metal rims. To mount the filters on a camera, the filter was placed between two rings; the <b>mount</b> <b>ring</b> either screwed into the lens threads or was slipped over the lens barrel and the retaining ring screws into the mounting ring to hold the filter in place. The series designations are generally written as Roman numerals, I to IX, though {{there are a few}} sizes not written that way, such as Series 4.5 and Series 5.5. Most Series filter sizes are now obsolete, production having ceased by the late 1970s. However, Series 9 became a standard of the motion picture industry and Series 9 filters are still produced and sold today, particularly for professional motion picture cinematography.|$|E
5000|$|Pentax {{has one of}} {{the widest}} range of lenses {{available}} for a medium format camera. The first generation of lenses available had a standard multi-coating and were named [...] "Super-Takumar." [...] After the release of the improved 7-layer coating, they were labeled with a [...] "Takumar Super-Multi-Coated" [...] engraving. Later lenses would abandon the Takumar branding in favor of Pentax SMC. Most of the lenses are [...] "Auto-Aperture" [...] type to allow for the brightest viewing and focusing of the lens for composition of the subject. The lens also has an aperture tab that couples to the indexed sliding ring found under the <b>mount</b> <b>ring</b> of the body. In turn the ring has a chain connected and running up into the finder bay and linked to a tab under spring tension. Operation of the aperture ring would operate the ring and feed the chain back and forth to move an indexing tab. This was only utilized by the TTL-Meter Prism and was not needed for any other finder available. The exceptions for [...] "Auto-Aperture" [...] or aperture linkage are: The 75mm Shift due to the manner that the base must slide out of direct alignment to the forward elements that the linkages for the Auto-Aperture is not possible. The 120mm Soft Focus due to its dual aperture system. The 600mm & 800mm due to their [...] "Rach and Pinion" [...] focus that {{it is not possible to}} have linkages to the Auto-Aperture. The 1000mm being a catadioptric lens that it is not possible to have an aperture.|$|E
40|$|Two sets of carbon-carbon grids in a three-grid SAND {{configuration}} were endurance {{tested for}} 700 hours. Pre- and post test inspections employing electron microscope scans, x-ray fluorescence, grid mass loss measurements, and measurements of grid aperture diameters and thicknesses revealed an extraordinary low degree of erosion. No reduction in grid thicknesses was detectable within {{the margin of}} error of the measurements. Mass losses for the grids were on tbe order of 0. 1 gm to 0. 25 gm for the decelerator and accelerator grids, respectively and were attributed to an enlargement of grid apertures of 60 to 70 /l m for the accelerator grids. Grid perveance measurements were performed for two grid sets at various grid gap settings. Perveances obtained for carbon-carbon were slightly lower than those found for molybdenum grids which was attributed to a larger grid thickness of the carbon-carbon accelerator and decelerator grids. New, advanced carbon-carbon panels were fabricated with fiber volume fractions of up to 57 % and flexural moduli approaching the value for molybdenum, making these grid panels some of the strongest carbon-carbon material ever made. Dished 30 -cm carbon-carbon panels and a carbon-carbon <b>mount</b> <b>ring</b> were fabricated for a grid set retrofittable to the 30 -cm NSTAR engine...|$|E

50|$|The Coolpix 9xx {{series of}} cameras is {{noteworthy}} for the swivel style body. This allowed {{the user to}} rotate the lens {{with respect to the}} LCD screen and controls providing comfortable viewing {{in a wide range of}} shooting positions. The swivel body also allowed a physically much larger lens to be packaged into the camera with a wide telephoto range and exceptional macro capabilities. The internal lens does not use a pop out design and a fixed 28mm threaded lens <b>mounting</b> <b>ring</b> was included at the front. The diameter of the <b>mounting</b> <b>ring</b> happens to coincide with that of most clinical microscopes, resulting in the 9xx series becoming popular for hand-held eyepiece-projection photomicrography.

40|$|Previously, it was {{difficult}} to fabricate deformable mirrors made by piezoelectric actuators. This is because numerous actuators need to be precisely assembled to control the surface shape of the mirror. Two approaches have been developed. Both approaches begin by depositing a stack of piezoelectric films and electrodes over a silicon wafer substrate. In the first approach, the silicon wafer is removed initially by plasmabased reactive ion etching (RIE), and non-plasma dry etching with xenon difluoride (XeF 2). In the second approach, the actuator film stack is immersed in a liquid such as deionized water. The adhesion between the actuator film stack and the substrate is relatively weak. Simply by seeping liquid between the film and the substrate, the actuator film stack is gently released from the substrate. The deformable mirror contains multiple piezoelectric membrane layers as well as multiple electrode layers (some are patterned and some are unpatterned). At the piezolectric layer, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), or its co-polymer, poly(vinylidene fluoride trifluoroethylene P(VDF-TrFE) is used. The surface of the mirror is coated with a reflective coating. The actuator film stack is fabricated on silicon, or silicon on insulator (SOI) substrate, by repeatedly spin-coating the PVDF or P(VDFTrFE) solution and patterned metal (electrode) deposition. In the first approach, the actuator film stack is prepared on SOI substrate. Then, the thick silicon (typically 500 -micron thick and called handle silicon) of the SOI wafer is etched by a deep reactive ion etching process tool (SF 6 -based plasma etching). This deep RIE stops at the middle SiO 2 layer. The middle SiO 2 layer is etched by either HF-based wet etching or dry plasma etch. The thin silicon layer (generally called a device layer) of SOI is removed by XeF 2 dry etch. This XeF 2 etch is very gentle and extremely selective, so the released mirror membrane is not damaged. It is possible to replace SOI with silicon substrate, but this will require tighter DRIE process control as well as generally longer and less efficient XeF 2 etch. In the second approach, the actuator film stack is first constructed on a silicon wafer. It helps to use a polyimide intermediate layer such as Kapton because the adhesion between the polyimide and silicon is generally weak. A mirror <b>mount</b> <b>ring</b> is attached by using adhesive. Then, the assembly is partially submerged in liquid water. The water tends to seep between the actuator film stack and silicon substrate. As a result, the actuator membrane can be gently released from the silicon substrate. The actuator membrane is very flat because it is fixed to the mirror mount prior to the release. Deformable mirrors require extremely good surface optical quality. In the technology described here, the deformable mirror is fabricated on pristine substrates such as prime-grade silicon wafers. The deformable mirror is released by selectively removing the substrate. Therefore, the released deformable mirror surface replicates the optical quality of the underlying pristine substrate...|$|E

50|$|The Ye-151 cannon-armed {{version was}} {{designed}} {{in parallel with}} the Ye-150 but did not proceed to the hardware stage. The weapon system was to have consisted of twin TKB-495 or Makarov TKB-539 cannon, with a rate of fire of 2,000 rds/min, mounted on a rotating <b>ring</b> in tilting <b>mounts.</b> The mounts could tilt ±30° and the <b>mounting</b> <b>ring</b> could rotate 360°, which gave the installation a 60° cone of fire around the centreline of the <b>mounting</b> <b>ring.</b> To accommodate the ring turret, the inlet duct was lengthened with the rotating ring forming the inlet lip, wind tunnel testing confirming that the extended inlet duct would actually improve aerodynamic and inlet performance; the lengthened inlet was retained for all later Ye-150 series aircraft (without cannon installation). Further tunnel testing with an inlet mounting fitted with cannon revealed destabilising forces when the cannon were deflected, making accurate weapon aiming impossible and precluding further development. Studies were carried out with the cannon mount aft of the cockpit to reduce the destabilising moment, as the Ye-151-2, but no hardware resulted.|$|R
