40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multi scale color coding technique which enhances the visualization of scalar fields along integration lines in vector fields. In particular, this multi scale technique enables {{one to see}} detailed variations in selected small ranges of the scalar field {{while at the same}} time allowing one to observe the entire range of values of the scalar field. This type of visualization, observing small variations as well as the entire range of values, is usually not possible with uniform color coding. This multi scale approach, which is linear within each division of the scale (piecewise linear), is a general visualization technique that can be applied to many different scalar fields of interest. As an example, in this paper we apply it to the visualization of fluid flow <b>mixing</b> <b>indicators</b> along pathlines in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Pathlines are the trajectories of fluid particles over time in the CFD simulations, and applying multi scale color coding on the pathlines brings out quantities of interest in the flow such as curvature, torsion and specific measure of length generation, which are indicators of the degree of mixing in the fluid system. In contrast to uniform color coding, this multi scale scheme can display small variations in the <b>mixing</b> <b>indicators</b> and still show the entire range of values of these indicators. In this paper, the <b>mixing</b> <b>indicators</b> are computed and displayed only along line structures (pathlines) in the flow field rather than at all points in the flow field...|$|R

The use of pozzolan as a partial replacement of Portland cement reduces the carbon dioxide emitted per tonne of product and can also improve various physical properties of the resulting cementitious composites. Assessment of the pozzolanic activity of cement replacement materials is increasingly important {{because of the economic}} sustainability of cementing materials. The pozzolanic activity of wheat straw ash, silica fume, nanosilica, two diatomites, glass powder and expanded perlite have been investigated and compared using the strength activity index test, the modified Chapelle test and the pozzolanicity test in accordance with the European Standard EN 196 - 5. From an experimental investigation of seven different pozzolans, the following main conclusions can be drawn. In the case of an acid-base titration (determination of [OH–], the procedure specified in EN 196 - 5) is better to use Tashiro (<b>mixed</b> <b>indicator)</b> instead of required methyl orange, Tashiro changes color at the endpoint of a titration distinctly.

40|$|In this paper, the infotaxis-based search {{algorithm}} is tested in several simulated turbulent channel flows.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{recovering}} the waste in storage tanks at the Savannah River Site (SRS) typically requires mixing {{the contents of}} the tank with one to four dual-nozzle jet mixers located within the tank. The typical criteria to establish a mixed condition in a tank are {{based on the number of}} pumps in operation and the time duration of operation. To ensure that a mixed condition is achieved, operating times are set conservatively long. This approach results in high operational costs because of the long mixing times and high maintenance and repair costs for the same reason. A significant reduction in both of these costs might be realized by reducing the required mixing time based on calculating a reliable <b>indicator</b> of <b>mixing</b> with a suitably validated computer code. The work described in this report establishes the basis for further development of the theory leading to the identified <b>mixing</b> <b>indicators,</b> the benchmark analyses demonstrating their consistency with widely accepted correlations, and the application of those indicators to SRS waste tanks to provide a better, physically based estimate of the required mixing time. Waste storage tanks at SRS contain settled sludge which varies in height from zero to 10 ft. The sludge has been characterized and modeled as micron-sized solids, typically 1 to 5 microns, at weight fractions as high as 20 to 30 wt%, specific gravities to 1. 4, and viscosities up to 64 cp during motion. The sludge is suspended and mixed through the use of submersible slurry jet pumps. To suspend settled sludge, water is added to the tank as a slurry medium and stirred with the jet pump. Although there is considerable technical literature on mixing and solid suspension in agitated tanks, very little literature has been published on jet mixing in a large-scale tank. If shorter mixing times can be shown to support Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) or other feed requirements, longer pump lifetimes can be achieved with associated operational cost and schedule savings. The focus of the present work is to establish mixing criteria associated with the waste processing at SRS and to quantify the mixing time required to suspend sludge particles with the submersible jet pump. Literature results for a turbulent jet flow are reviewed briefly, since the decay of the axial jet velocity and the evolution of the jet flow patterns are important phenomena affecting sludge suspension and mixing operations. One of the main objectives in the waste processing is to provide the DWPF a uniform slurry composition at a certain weight percentage (typically {approx} 13 wt%) over an extended period of time. In preparation of the sludge for slurrying to DWPF, several important questions have been raised with regard to sludge suspension and mixing of the solid suspension in the bulk of the tank: (1) How much time is required to prepare a slurry with a uniform solid composition for DWPF? (2) How long will it take to suspend and mix the sludge for uniform composition in any particular waste tank? (3) What are good <b>mixing</b> <b>indicators</b> to answer the questions concerning sludge mixing stated above in a general fashion applicable to any waste tank/slurry pump geometry and fluid/sludge combination? Grenville and Tilton (1996) investigated the mixing process by giving a pulse of tracer (electrolyte) through the submersible jet nozzle and by monitoring the conductivity at three locations within the cylindrical tank. They proposed that the mixing process was controlled by the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate in the region far away from the jet entrance. They took the energy dissipation rates in the regions remote from the nozzle to be proportional to jet velocity and jet diameter at that location. The reduction in the jet velocity was taken to be proportional to the nozzle velocity and distance from the nozzle. Based on their analysis, a correlation was proposed. The proposed correlation was shown to be valid over a wide range of Reynolds numbers (50, 000 to 300, 000) with a relative standard deviation of {+-} 11. 83 %. An improved correlation including the effect of circulation time was proposed by Grenville and Tilton [11] via a better fit of mixing time data for turbulent jet mixing under a wider range of jet Reynolds numbers (50, 000 to 300, 000). The circulation time was defined as the liquid volume divided by the entrained flow rate. They assumed that the mixing rate at the end of the jet length controls the mixing time for the entire tank by estimating the kinetic energy dissipation rate as discussed earlier. They predicted that for a given volume, an optimum geometry exists for a mixing vessel, allowing a desired mixing time to be achieved for a minimum power input. The current work will compare their correlation of the jet mixing time with CFD modeling results for their experimental tanks in an attempt to achieve a fundamental understanding of the turbulent jet mixing and to establish <b>mixing</b> <b>indicators...</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: This paper {{examines}} if, when {{controlling for}} biophysical and geographical variables (including rainfall, productivity of agricultural lands, topography/temperature, and market access through road networks), socioeconomic {{and health care}} indicators help to explain variations in the under-five mortality rate across districts from nine high focus states in India. The literature on this subject is inconclusive because the survey data, upon which most studies of child mortality rely, rarely include variables that measure these factors. This paper introduces these variables into an analysis of 284 districts from nine high focus states in India. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Information on the mortality indicator was accessed from the recently conducted Annual Health Survey of 2011 and other socioeconomic and geographic variables from Census 2011, District Level Household and Facility Survey (2007 - 08), Department of Economics and Statistics Divisions of the concerned states. Displaying high spatial dependence (spatial autocorrelation) in the mortality indicator (outcome variable) and its possible predictors used in the analysis, the paper uses the Spatial-Error Model {{in an effort to}} negate or reduce the spatial dependence in model parameters. The results evince that the coverage gap index (a <b>mixed</b> <b>indicator</b> of district wise coverage of reproductive and child health services), female literacy, urbanization, economic status, the number of newborn care provided in Primary Health Centers in the district transpired as significant correlates of under-five mortality in the nine high focus states in India. The study identifies three clusters with high under-five mortality rate including 30 districts, and advocates urgent attention. CONCLUSION: Even after controlling the possible biophysical and geographical variables, the study reveals that the health program initiatives have a major role to play in reducing under-five mortality rate in the high focus states in India...|$|E

The lymphocyte preparations contained an average of 0. 36 % basophils which also formed Eo'-IgE' rosettes, suggestiing that about 4 % of the lymphocytes bound IgE. The rosette formation was inhibited by IgE myeloma protiens or IgE Fc fragments but not by IgE Fab fragments or Ig of the other classes. On the average, the lymphocytes of the 12 donors contained 70. 5 % cells forming spontaneous rosettes with sheep erythrocytes (E), 10. 6 % cells having surface immunoglobulin (SIg), and 15. 5 % bunding IgG as shown by rosette formation with IgG-coated ox red cells (EoA). Fractionation of the lymphocytes into populations rich in spontaneously E-rosetting cells and cells with SIg indicated {{that the majority of the}} lymphocytes forming Eo'-IgE rosettes belonged to the SIg-positive lymphocytes.

Rabbit Fc-specific antibodies were conjugated with PNC by a single step glutaraldehyde bridge. Among several indicators tested, bromothymol blue (BTB) was found suitable for measuring PNC activity under simulated conditions. Two reagents, starch-iodine complex (SIC) and a <b>mixed</b> pH <b>indicator,</b> containing bromocresol purple and BTB (2 : 1) used earlier for the PNC-based ELISA, were compared with BTB for utilization in the PNC-based ELISA. SIC gave a slightly higher virus titre than BTB or the <b>mixed</b> pH <b>indicator,</b> but it often gave nonspecific reactions. Sodium or potassium salts of penicillin-G at 0. 5 − 1. 0 mg/ml and BTB at 0. 2 mg/ml {{were found to be}} suitable as substrate-indicator mixture for PNC-based ELISA. The sensitivity of the PNC system was comparable to those of the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) systems in detecting MMV, PMV, and TSWV. The PNC conjugate could be used at a greater dilution than those of the ALP and HRP conjugates and the BTB substrate mixture was stable for at least 3 weeks at 4 °C. Penicillin is readily available in developing countries, and at a substantially lower cost than p-nitrophenyl phosphate, the commonly used substrate for ALP in the plate ELISA. Thus the PNC-based ELISA provides a less expensive means for assaying plant viruses by ELISA...|$|R
40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract: The {{protein chip}} {{technology}} which has less developed landscape {{as compared to}} the DNA chips, it faces the problem of universal recognition function or the strategy to obtain a universal chip for multitude of protein samples. This is due to the chemical complexity that protein carries as translational product of basic gene (DNA). There exists the basic contradiction of ‘chemical recognition specificity’ against ‘universal applicability’ in such a micro array based recognition which deals with higher chemical complexity. It is the key issue, whether it is possible to combine different methods of characterization and read out to make a platform by integrating specific and less specific methods of chemically diverse analyte recognition. The issue of universal application of chips for specific recognition of analytes has been addressed in this integration process. The primary aim of the work is to integrate various methods of characterization and read out, into the chip technology for liquid chemical recognition. In order to develop the multifunctional chemochips {{the state of the art}} characterization and read out techniques such as non-contact micro spotting, fluorescence digital imaging and AFM techniques have been used. The spotting technique was used to realize microarray of pure and <b>mixed</b> <b>indicator</b> functions as well as chemical reagents for local matrix modification. Rapid fluorescence CCD imaging techniques enables the real time recording of analyte-indicator molecule interaction by series of images with multiple excitation-emission wavelengths. Multivariate data analysis was applied on the pool of the data generated by the analysis of spot intensity changes in the recorded images which gives a better idea of the analyte classification. Along with these established methods the specially developed high resolution nano-positioning and measurements machine equipped with AFM mode (SPM-NPMM) has been used to characterize the micro spot array for the several millimeter range with the resolution and precision of an AFM technique. SPM-NPMM has a large dynamic measurement range of 25 × 25 × 5 mm 3 with the lateral resolution of 0. 1 nm. The SPM-NPMM measurements showed that the evaporation of solvent after spotting leads to the concentric double rim formation inside the micro-spots. These characteristic double rim features of the micro spot was found only for the binary mixed solvents with varying polarity like water and DMF spots due to differential transport of dissolved material in two different solvents during spot formation. High resolution SPM-NPMM measurements showed the inhomogeneous distribution of dye nano-crystals of 2 - 5 nm height restricted to only inner rim formed due to DMF in a double concentric rimed spots, as the dye has less solubility in the solvent. 	 Using single layer chemochip arrays made up of pH and polarity sensitive dyes it was possible to distinguish binary mixed solvents qualitatively and quantitatively. With the help of micro array patterns, the analyte with similar content of alcohol like mixture of 5 % (v/v) of ethanol in water and beers, or other alcoholic beverages can be distinguished qualitatively from the ethanol-water mixtures with corresponding ethanol content. The variation in fluorescent spot patterns acted like fingerprints for complex composed liquids like solvent mixtures and beverages. The multivariate data analysis done on the pool of data obtained from the chemochips experiment enables to distinguish certain classes of binary mixtures. Also, some other micro array components like binary mixed dye spots can be classified for their response towards multitude of liquid analytes using the PCA analysis. Analytical double layer chemochips were prepared by splitting the functions of ‘differentiation’ in top layer and ‘indication’ in bottom layer on the same chip. This was realized by stacking hydro-gel polymer layers with matrix modifier using solvent casting method. The top layer was assigned with mobility dependent differentiation by physically altering the polymer matrix using a cross-linking agent and bottom layer functioned as indicator due to doped fluorescent dyes. It was possible to distinguish different analytes by transition time of diffusion through differentiation top layer by the real time recording of series of images of the double layer arrays. The analyte molecules showed the variation in the transition time of their transport through the top layer depending up on its cross-linking degree. This transport of individual and mixtures of analytes through the differentiation layer can also be detected using the same fluorescence scheme used for single layer chemochips. The double layer chemochips also showed the analyte separation signal for a mixture of two different analyte molecules while diffusing through the differentiation layer. This can be attributed to the preferential interactions between analyte and the modified polymer environment as a transport medium. 	 The open issue of ‘Specificity versus Universality’ faced by less developed biochips like protein chips have been addressed through the reported work using different types of chemochips. It was shown that different preferential and general characterization using fluorescent micro spots was possible with single and double layer micro arrays as a compliment for the specific recognition done by the conventional spot array chips...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} {{recovering}} and processing High Level Waste (HLW) the waste in storage tanks at the Savannah River Site (SRS) typically requires mixing {{the contents of}} the tank with one to four mixers (pumps) located within the tank. The typical criteria to establish a mixed condition in a tank are {{based on the number of}} pumps in operation and the time duration of operation. To ensure that a mixed condition is achieved, operating times are typically set conservatively long. This approach results in high operational costs because of the long mixing times and high maintenance and repair costs for the same reason. A significant reduction in both of these costs might be realized by reducing the required mixing time based on calculating a reliable <b>indicator</b> of <b>mixing</b> with a suitably validated computer code. The focus of the present work is to establish mixing criteria applicable to miscible fluids, with an ultimate goal of addressing waste processing in HLW tanks at SRS and quantifying the mixing time required to suspend sludge particles with the submersible jet pump. A single-phase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach was taken for the analysis of jet flow patterns with an emphasis on the velocity decay and the turbulent flow evolution for the farfield region from the pump. Literature results for a turbulent jet flow are reviewed, since the decay of the axial jet velocity and the evolution of the jet flow patterns are important phenomena affecting sludge suspension and mixing operations. The work described in this report suggests a basis for further development of the theory leading to the identified <b>mixing</b> <b>indicators,</b> with benchmark analyses demonstrating their consistency with widely accepted correlations. Although the indicators are somewhat generic in nature, they are applied to Savannah River Site (SRS) waste tanks to provide a better, physically based estimate of the required mixing time. Waste storage tanks at SRS contain settled sludge which varies in height from zero to 10 ft. The sludge has been characterized and modeled as micron-sized solids, typically 1 to 5 microns, at weight fractions as high as 20 to 30 wt%, specific gravities to 1. 4, and viscosities up to 64 cp during motion. The sludge is suspended and mixed through the use of submersible slurry jet pumps. To suspend settled sludge, water is added to the tank as a slurry medium and stirred with the jet pump. Although there is considerable technical literature on mixing and solid suspension in agitated tanks, very little literature has been published on jet mixing in a large-scale tank. One of the main objectives in the waste processing is to provide feed of a uniform slurry composition at a certain weight percentage (e. g. typically {approx} 13 wt% at SRS) over an extended period of time. In preparation of the sludge for slurrying, several important questions have been raised with regard to sludge suspension and mixing of the solid suspension in the bulk of the tank: (1) How much time is required to prepare a slurry with a uniform solid composition? (2) How long will it take to suspend and mix the sludge for uniform composition in any particular waste tank? (3) What are good <b>mixing</b> <b>indicators</b> to answer the questions concerning sludge mixing stated above in a general fashion applicable to any waste tank/slurry pump geometry and fluid/sludge combination...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to examine the}} impact of socioeconomic and public health factors on childhood diseases and malnutrition in mentioned countries. The causes of child's illness or child's undernutrition are multiple. This work focuses on some risk factors which are assumed to cause the child's diseases and malnutrition as suggested by some previous works (see Kandala, 2001; Adebayo, 2002). Our analysis started with a large number of covariates including a set of bio-demographic and socioeconomic variables, such as current working status of mothers, place of residence, access to toilet facilities, etc (see chapter 2). The analyses are based on data from the 2003 household survey for Egypt and Nigeria for the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). More details about the data set are mentioned in the first chapter. The statistical analysis in this thesis is based on modern Bayesian approaches which allow a flexible framework for realistically complex models. These models allow us to analyze usual linear effects of categorical covariates, nonlinear effects of continuous covariates and the geographical effects within a unified semi-parametric Bayesian framework for modelling and inference. A first step of this work is to analyze the effects of the different types of covariates on response variables, diarrhea, fever, and cough which represent the child's diseases in our application. In this step, a Bayesian geoadditive logit model for binary response variables is used (see Fahrmeir and Lang, 2001). In a second step, we employ separate geoadditive probit models (instead of logit models used in the previous step) to the binary listed variables. Based on the results of the separate analyses, we applied geoadditive latent variable probit models (recently suggested by Raach, 2005; Raach and Fahrmeir, 2006) where the three observable disease variables are assumed to be indicators for the latent variable "health status" for the children. In this step, we also compared the results of the separate geoadditive probit models with the results of the latent variable models. As a third step, we used geoadditive Gaussian regression and latent variable models to analyze the malnutrition status of children in both countries. Finally, we used latent variable models for diseases and nutrition indicators together. In the final step, models with one as well as with two latent variables have been estimated using <b>mixed</b> <b>indicators</b> (binary indicators "health status", and continuous indicators "nutrition status") and the results are compared...|$|R
