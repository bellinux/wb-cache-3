40|$|We {{consider}} the NP-hard problem of MAP-inference for undirected discrete graphical models. We propose a polynomial time and practically efficient algorithm for finding {{a part of}} its optimal solution. Specifically, our algorithm <b>marks</b> some <b>labels</b> of the considered graphical model either as (i) optimal, meaning that they belong to all optimal solutions of the inference problem; (ii) non-optimal if they provably {{do not belong to}} any solution. With access to an exact solver of a linear programming relaxation to the MAP-inference problem, our algorithm marks the maximal possible (in a specified sense) number of labels. We also present a version of the algorithm, which has access to a suboptimal dual solver only and still can ensure the (non-) optimality for the <b>marked</b> <b>labels,</b> although the overall number of the <b>marked</b> <b>labels</b> may decrease. We propose an efficient implementation, which runs in time comparable to a single run of a suboptimal dual solver. Our method is well-scalable and shows state-of-the-art results on computational benchmarks from machine learning and computer vision. Comment: Reworked version, submitted to PAM...|$|R

5000|$|Eedge {{indices are}} forms of index that {{consists}} of marks {{on the edges of}} the pages of a printed work. These marks are step-like printed and usually contain order words, letters, or numbers, (e.g., A to Z in a dictionary or telephone book). Usually, they are colored and help to find desired points, especially in reference works. They are created by printing {{to the edge of the}} sheet so that they are visible on the closed books' edge. When each edge index <b>mark</b> <b>labels</b> one chapter, the desired one can be found by counting the marks. When the edge index <b>marks</b> <b>label</b> first letters in a dictionary or telephone book, some can be identified by their [...] "thickness", (e.g., in English there are only few words beginning with [...] "Q", but many beginning with [...] "S").|$|R
