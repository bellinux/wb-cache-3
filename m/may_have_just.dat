5|$|Tubman and her brothers, Ben and Henry, {{escaped from}} slavery on September 17, 1849. Tubman {{had been hired}} out to Dr. Anthony Thompson, who owned a large {{plantation}} in an area called Poplar Neck in neighboring Caroline County; it is likely her brothers labored for Thompson as well. Because the slaves were hired out to another household, Eliza Brodess probably did not recognize their absence as an escape attempt for some time. Two weeks later, she posted a runaway notice in the Cambridge Democrat, offering a reward of up to 100 dollars for each slave returned. Once they had left, Tubman's brothers had second thoughts. Ben <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> become a father. The two men went back, forcing Tubman to return with them.|$|E

25|$|IR {{has several}} classes of travel {{with or without}} air conditioning. A train <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> one or many classes of travel. Slow {{passenger}} trains have only unreserved seating class whereas Rajdhani, Duronto, Shatabdi, Garib Rath and Yuva trains have only air-conditioned classes. The fares for all classes are different with unreserved seating class being the cheapest. The fare of Rajdhani, Duronto and Shatabdi trains includes food served in the train, but the fare for other trains does not include food {{that has to be}} bought separately. From September 2016, the IR have introduced dynamic fares for all accommodation classes for Rajdhani, Duronto and Shatabdi trains(except 1AC and EC classes) to shore up revenue. In long-distance trains a pantry car is usually included and the food is served at the berth or seat itself. Luxury trains such as Palace on Wheels have separate dining cars, but these trains cost as much as or more than a five-star hotel room.|$|E

500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Make Me Like You" [...] premiered on Stefani's Vevo account {{the morning after}} its live {{broadcast}} on February 16, 2016. It was not available as a paid download in the United States until February 29. Outside North America, the video was released on June 7. Facebook Live promoted the video after its release; according to Target chief marketing officer Jeff Jones, [...] "more than 3 billion media impressions... for the campaign" [...] were generated and the video had nearly two million YouTube views. Natalie Finn of E! Online called it [...] "spot-on as always", and enjoyed the costume changes, roller-skating and [...] "Gwen-look-alike dancers". Nolan Feeney wrote for Time, [...] "Gwen Stefani wasn’t scheduled to perform during the 2016 Grammys, but she <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> delivered one of the evening’s most colorful performances anyway". Spin writer Brennan Carley gave the video a positive review, calling it [...] "the definition of quintessential Stefani – bold, colorful, peppy, and utterly timeless". Cole Delbyck wrote for the Huffington Post, [...] "Stefani turned a routine commercial break into a revolving, retro roller-skating bonanza, executing enough costume changes, choreography and visual stunts to make [...] look like an embarrassing middle school musical".|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} advances {{were also}} highly praised by critics: Lopez claimed that [...] "Relic not only tackled space, but <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> changed strategy games forever." [...] Reviewers praised the full 3D {{nature of the}} game as elevating it from its otherwise standard real-time strategy gameplay systems; Levine said that the 3D was what made the game unique, and Ryan explicitly termed the base gameplay as [...] "fairly similar to any tried-and-true real-time strategy game" [...] but said that the 3D elements and connected mission structure {{turned it into a}} [...] "different breed" [...] of game. Fortune, however, focused instead on the difficulty of the missions themselves, praising the challenge and variety of tactics needed to complete the game and lauding it for having [...] "some of the best fleet battles ever seen in a computer game". Levine, Ryan, Keefer, and Lopez all noted the connected mission structure as an innovation in the genre: by limiting the resources to build ships and pulling the same fleet through the missions, Homeworld converted what would usually be a set of disconnected missions into [...] "chapters" [...] of a continuous game. They felt this connected the player to their fleet as more than disposable units, and added a level of strategy to the game. Keefer and Levine did note, however, that this added a great deal of difficulty to the game, especially for more casual players, as the player could make decisions in earlier levels that rendered later ones very difficult to complete without an explicit difficulty level to counteract it. Ryan and Keefer also considered the 3D movement disorienting at first, though Levine and Samuel said the controls were [...] "as easy as possible".|$|E
2500|$|The Who Dey chant's {{first known}} use was by {{fans of the}} 1980 Cincinnati Bengals.

2500|$|Bartleby's {{character}} {{can be interpreted}} as a [...] "psychological double" [...] for the narrator that criticizes the [...] "sterility, impersonality, and mechanical adjustments of the world which the lawyer inhabits". Until {{the very end of the}} short story, the work gives the reader no history of Bartleby. [...] This lack of history suggests that Bartleby <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> sprung from the narrator's mind. Also consider the narrator's behavior around Bartleby: screening him off in a corner where he can have his privacy [...] "symbolizes the lawyer's compartmentalization of the unconscious forces which Bartleby represents".|$|E
2500|$|The nritta [...] {{performance}} {{starts off}} with a thàth sequence, which is a slower graceful movement of wrists, neck and eyebrows. Thereafter, the dancer gradually increases speed and energy, while completing a sequence of bol (mnemonic syllables in Indian tradition). Each bol has short sections, similar to technical exercises in western dance traditions, wherein the dancer engages the audience with tora, tukra, parhant, paran and others stressing footwork, gestures and turns. Each section when completed has a punctuation mark, usually a sharp turn of the head. Each ankle is adorned with small bells (ghungroo), which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> one bell or hundreds. The dancer's rapid movements and footwork in a nritta is perfectly timed to the musical beats (tala) and tempos, and the footwork sequences are called tatkars.|$|E
2500|$|Hairy Lee – A hairy {{version of}} Weebl {{and an expert}} on hypnotism. He is {{probably}} a caveman, which would explain the hair and the fact he usually talks in grunts. First appeared in [...] "Hairy." [...] Known as [...] "Baldie Lee" [...] in the 1980s prior to an overdose on cheese. However, prior to and following this event, he looked about the same. He <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> seemed bald in comparison with Weebl and Bob's mullets, which were inexplicably destroyed {{near the end of the}} episode.

2500|$|As of the 16th Century, {{what is now}} {{the state}} of Virginia was {{occupied}} by three main culture groups-- the Iroquoian, the Eastern Siouan & the [...] Algonquian. The tip of the Delmarva Peninsula south of the Indian River was controlled by the Algonquian [...] Nanticoke. Meanwhile, the Tidewater region along the Chesapeake Bay coastline appears to have been controlled by the Algonquian [...] Piscataway (who lived around the Potomac River), the Powhatan & Chowanoke, or Roanoke (who lived between the James River & Neuse River.). Inland of them were two Iroquoian tribes known as the [...] Nottoway, or Managog, & the Meherrin. The rest of Virginia was almost entirely Eastern Sioux, who held lands from the Bluestone River between West Virginia & Kentucky, all the way around through southwest Virginia and up to the Maryland border (the region of the Shenandoah River Valley was controlled by a different people). Also, the lands of Muskogean people connected to the Mississippian Culture <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> barely crossed over into the state into it's southwestern corner. Later, these tribes merged to form the Yuchi.|$|E
2500|$|The {{announcement}} of Jackson's first 10 performances {{was made by}} the singer himself, during a press conference at the O2 Arena on March 5, 2009. As many as 7,000 fans and 350 reporters awaited the singer's arrival, many donning Jackson-related clothing. The singer commented at the conference, [...] "I {{just wanted to say that}} these will be my final show performances in London. When I say this is it, it really means this is it", adding that it was his [...] "final curtain call", although he <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> been referring to performing in London. Organizers touted the residency as, [...] "dramatic shows [...] promise an explosive return with a band of the highest calibre, a state-of-the-art stage show and incredible surprise support acts". Hours before the press conference, promotional posters for the residency were displayed around London. Further promotion took up an entire commercial break period on ITV London during Dancing on Ice, the first time this has ever happened for a musical artist. The advert, which cost £1 million to air, was viewed by 11 million people.|$|E
2500|$|Divided roughly {{along the}} Santee River {{were the two}} main groups of Native American peoples-- Hokan Sioux (Ancestral Sioux) & the Cusaboan tribes. Relative to the Hokan were mostly the Waccamaw Siouan & the Sewee. That being said, there were also the [...] Wateree, [...] Woccon & the [...] Santee (not to be {{confused}} with the Dakota Santee of the west.) Hokan Sioux lived in a narrow, zigzagging region from modern day Ohio to the Carolina coast. Most of the region south of the Santee River was controlled by the Muskogean Cusabo tribes. North of the Sewee were the Croatan, an Algonquian nation related to the Chowanoke, Piscataway, Nanticoke & Powhatan further north. Many descendants of the Croatan survive among the Lumbee, who also took in many Siouan peoples of the region. Deeper inland, other Muskogean tribes merged to form the Yamasee. The lands of the Cherokee <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> grazed into the state, but they were set further back in Appalachia. In the 18th century, both the Yamasee & Cherokee merged with other tribes to form the Creek Confederacy, who later fractured after conquering mush of the east coast.

2500|$|Subjective {{measures}} directly assess SA {{by asking}} individuals {{to rate their}} own or the observed SA of individuals on an anchored scale (e.g., participant situation awareness questionnaire (PSAQ) – Strater, Endsley, Pleban, & Matthews, 2001; the situation awareness rating technique (SART) – Taylor, 1989). Subjective measures of SA are attractive {{in that they are}} relatively straightforward and easy to administer. [...] However, several limitations should be noted. Individuals making subjective assessments of their own SA are often unaware of information they do not know (the [...] "unknown unknowns"). Subjective measures also tend to be global in nature, and, as such, do not fully exploit the multivariate nature of SA to provide the detailed diagnostics available with objective measures. Nevertheless, self-ratings may be useful in that they can provide an assessment of operators' degree of confidence in their SA and their own performance. Measuring how SA is perceived by the operator may provide information as important as the operator's actual SA, since errors in perceived SA quality (over-confidence or under-confidence in SA) <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> as harmful an effect on an individual's or team's decision-making as errors in their actual SA (Endsley, 1998).|$|E
2500|$|George Hutchinson was an {{unemployed}} labourer. On 12 November 1888, {{he made a}} formal statement to the London police {{that in the early}} hours of 9 November 1888, Mary Jane Kelly approached him in the street and asked him for money. He stated that he had then followed her and another man of conspicuous appearance to her room, and had watched the room for about three-quarters of an hour without seeing either leave. He gave a very detailed description of the man, claiming he was [...] "of Jewish appearance", despite the darkness of that night. The accuracy of Hutchinson's statement was disputed among the senior police. Inspector Frederick Abberline, after interviewing Hutchinson, believed that Hutchinson's account was truthful. However, Robert Anderson, head of the CID, later claimed that the only witness who got a good look at the killer was Jewish. Hutchinson was not a Jew, and thus not that witness. Hutchinson's statement was made on the day that Mary Kelly's inquest was held, and he was not called to testify. Some modern scholars have suggested that Hutchinson was the Ripper himself, trying to confuse the police with a false description, but others suggest he <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> been an attention seeker who made up a story he hoped to sell to the press.|$|E
2500|$|Aloha from Hawaii {{proved to}} be the last great moment in the life of Presley and Parker. In May 1973, in an attempt to deal with Presley's growing {{dependence}} on prescription drugs, Presley's father, Vernon, and Parker attempted to cut off his supply. They hired private detectives to find out where the drugs were coming from and were successful in stopping any more from reaching Presley. However, it wasn't long before Presley was able to find other doctors to meet his demands. In later years, several of Presley's inner circle would tell of how difficult it was to persuade Presley to quit the drugs. As well as being their employer and paying their wages, he was also their main source of access to drugs for themselves. Presley's main doctor, George C. Nichopoulos, would often replace Presley's medication with placebos in an attempt to wean him off the drugs. This would be successful for a short time, but when Presley discovered the trick he simply found himself other doctors. Author Alanna Nash suggests {{that one of the reasons}} Parker didn't do more is because he <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> not known how to handle the situation. In her book, The Colonel, she writes [...] "in the days before the Betty Ford Clinic, the Colonel didn't know where to take him for discreet, effective help and loathed risking the loss of work if the truth got out." ...|$|E
