40|$|Systems that {{learn from}} {{examples}} often create a disjunctive concept definition. Small disjuncts are those disjuncts which cover {{only a few}} training examples. The problem with small disjuncts {{is that they are}} <b>more</b> error <b>prone</b> than large disjuncts. This paper investigates the reasons why small disjuncts are <b>more</b> error <b>prone</b> than large disjuncts. It shows that when there are rare cases within a domain, then factors such as attribute noise, missing attributes, class noise and training set size can result in small disjuncts being <b>more</b> error <b>prone</b> than large disjuncts and in rare cases being <b>more</b> error <b>prone</b> than common cases. This paper also assesses the impact that these error prone small disjuncts and rare cases have on inductive learning (i. e., on error rate). One key conclusion is that when low levels of attribute noise are applied only to the training set (the ability to learn the correct concept is being evaluated), rare cases within a domain are primarily responsible for making learning difficult. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Clones are {{generally}} considered bad programming practice in software engineering folklore. They {{are identified as}} a bad smell (Fowler et al, 1999) and {{a major contributor to}} project maintenance difficulties. Clones inherently cause code bloat, thus increasing project size and maintenance costs. In this work, we try to validate the conventional wisdom empirically to see whether cloning makes code <b>more</b> defect <b>prone.</b> This paper analyses the relationship between cloning and defect proneness. For the four medium to large open source projects that we studied, we find that, first, the great majority of bugs are not significantly associated with clones. Second, we find that clones may be less defect prone than non-cloned code. Third, we find little evidence that clones with more copies are actually <b>more</b> error <b>prone.</b> Fourth, we find little evidence to support the claim that clone groups that span more than one file or directory are <b>more</b> defect <b>prone</b> than collocated clones. Finally, we find that developers do not need to put a disproportionately higher effort to fix clone dense bugs. Our findings do not support the claim that clones are really a “bad smell ” (Fowler et al, 1999). Perhaps we can clone, and breathe easily, at the same time. ...|$|R

First, the storm decelerated after landfall and maintained its identity for 120hours while moving south of due west. Secondly, the storm was asymmetric and rainfall concentrated in the southern semicircle. Also, the storm interacted with the active monsoon over the South China Sea, and the Hong Kong Observatory reported a 1-hour rainfall total of 115.1mm (4.5inches), a new record. Finally, previous rainfall had made the area wetter than normal and <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> to flooding.|$|E

In absolute terms, only a very small proportion of pituitary tumors eventually undergoes apoplexy. In an analysis of incidentally found pituitary tumors, apoplexy occurred in 0.2% annually, but the risk was higher in tumors larger than 10mm ("macroadenomas") and tumors that were growing more rapidly; in a meta-analysis, not all these associations achieved statistical significance.|$|E

5|$|Forest {{and river}} {{habitats}} in the watershed have been heavily affected by human activities ever since Gold Rush mining {{began in the}} 1800s. Commercial logging has caused mountain slopes to become <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> to erosion; even {{in areas that are}} no longer logged and have seen secondary forest growth, abandoned logging roads pose a serious erosive threat. Grazing of livestock has also degraded grasslands and exposed soils to runoff. This has resulted in river channels becoming clogged and confined by sediment, harming salmon and steelhead populations by burying gravel bars used by these fish for spawning. Along the South Fork, this problem has been exacerbated by the inherently unstable rocks and soils of the Franciscan formation, causing mass wasting events that dump sediment into streams.|$|E
5|$|High {{rainfall}} {{can cause}} widespread flooding, {{which can lead}} to landslides and mudflows in mountainous areas. Such floods cause rivers to burst their banks and submerge homes. The Ghaggar-Hakra River, which only flows during India's monsoon season, can flood and severely damage local crops. Floods can be exacerbated by fires during the previous dry season, which cause soils which are sandy or composed of loam to become hydrophobic, or water repellent. In various ways governments may help people deal with wet season floods. Flood plain mapping identifies which areas are <b>more</b> <b>prone</b> to flooding.

According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner.

40|$|Template {{switching}} between copackaged {{human immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) genomic RNAs is genetically silent when identical RNAs are copackaged but yields recombinants when virions contain two distinct RNAs. Sequencing has revealed that errors at retroviral recombination junctions are infrequent, suggesting that template switching is not intrinsically mutagenic. Here, we tested the hypothesis that template switching may instead contribute to replication fidelity. This hypothesis predicts that reverse transcription of a single-copy gene will be <b>more</b> error <b>prone</b> than replication {{in the presence of}} a second copy. To test this, HIV- 1 -based vectors containing both lacZ and the puromycin resistance marker were expressed either alone or with an excess of an “empty” vector lacking lacZ and puro. This resulted in virions with either RNA homodimers or haploid genomes with only a single lacZ-puro RNA. In untreated cells, lacZ inactivation rates suggested that haploid vector reverse transcription was slightly <b>more</b> error <b>prone</b> than that of homodimerized pseudodiploid vectors. Haploid reverse transcription was at least threefold <b>more</b> error <b>prone</b> than pseudodiploid-templated synthesis when slowed by hydroxyurea treatment or stopped prematurely with zidovudine. Individual products of one- and two-copy genes revealed both nucleotide substitutions and deletions, with deletions more frequent than point mutations among haploid genome products. Similar spectra of defective products were observed at early reverse transcription time points and among products of haploid virions. These results indicate that faithful, full-length reverse transcription products were underrepresented in the absence of a reserve of genetic information and suggest that template switching contributes to HIV- 1 genomic integrity...|$|R
