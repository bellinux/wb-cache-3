Crosscutting interfaces have been incorporated by the aSideML modeling language in order to enhance aspect description at the design level.

Finally, we present two large-scale case studies we have performed using this modeling language that support our arguments in favor of crosscutting interfaces.|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of crosscutting concerns, i. e., functional-ities {{that are not}} assigned to a single <b>modular</b> <b>unit</b> in the implementation, {{is one of the}} major problems in software understanding and evolution. In fact, they are hard to locate (scattering) and may give rise to multiple ripple effects (tan-gling). Aspect Oriented Programming offers mechanisms to factor them out into a <b>modular</b> <b>unit,</b> called an aspect. In this paper, aspect identication in existing code is supported by means of dynamic code analysis. Execution traces are generated for the use cases that exercise the main functionalities of the given application. The relationship between execution traces and executed computational units (class methods) is subjected to concept analysis. In the re-sulting lattice, potential aspects are detected by determin-ing the use-case specic concepts and examining their spe-cic computational units. When these come from multiple modules (classes) which contribute to multiple use-cases, a candidate aspect is recognized. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{final report}} which was {{prepared}} {{within the framework}} of the MODULAR R and D project presents the results of detailed preliminary studies of the traffic and transport serviceability, the technical feasibility, and the economic benefits of <b>modular</b> vehicle <b>units,</b> which consists of a basic midibus and an additonal coupling module, for public transport companies in the region under review. The partial results are summarized: <b>modular</b> vehicle <b>units</b> can replace articulated buses which are little profitable in rural areas. They can also replace standard buses which cannot be used economically. <b>Modular</b> vehicles as <b>units</b> with two-axle or center-axle modules can be provided with conventional gangways or low platforms. Existing maintenance and repair strategies can be applied because <b>modular</b> vehicle <b>units</b> are largely based on standardized vehicle components. Cost savings are in the range of 6 to 15 % depending on the individual conditions. <b>Modular</b> vehicle <b>units</b> contribute to the stabilization and improvement of the threatened rural public transport services.

40|$|Abstract. Aspect-oriented {{software}} development promotes improved separation of concerns by introducing a new <b>modular</b> <b>unit,</b> called aspect, for the modularization of crosscutting concerns. As {{a new kind}} of <b>modular</b> <b>unit,</b> aspects should have explicit interfaces that describe the way they interact {{with the rest of the}} system and how they affect other modules. This interaction can be homogeneous, for example, by providing a logging behavior that affects all procedures in a certain interface; or it can be heterogeneous, for example, by implementing the two sides of a protocol that affects two different classes. In this paper, we present crosscutting interfaces as a conceptual tool for dealing with the complexity of heterogeneous aspects at the design level. Crosscutting interfaces have been incorporated by the aSideML modeling language in order to enhance aspect description at the design level. Moreover, we present a modeling notation for the description of architecture-level aspects that also supports the explicit representation of crosscutting interfaces. Finally, we present a large-scale case study we have performed using this modeling language that supports our arguments in favor of crosscutting interfaces. 1...|$|R
