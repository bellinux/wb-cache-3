This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} data sharing among <b>multiple</b> <b>parties</b> in the following scenario: without disclosing their private data to each other, <b>multiple</b> <b>parties,</b> each having a private data set, want to collaboratively construct support vector machines using a linear, polynomial or sigmoid kernel function. To tackle this problem, we develop a secure protocol for <b>multiple</b> <b>parties</b> to conduct the desired computation. In our solution, <b>multiple</b> <b>parties</b> use homomorphic encryption and digital envelope techniques to exchange the data while keeping it private. All the parties are treated symmetrically: they all participate in the encryption and in the computation involved in learning support vector machines...|$|R

We address this challenging {{problem in the}} following scenario: without disclosing their private data to each other, <b>multiple</b> <b>parties,</b> each having a private data set, want to collaboratively conduct k-medoids clustering. To tackle this problem, we develop secure protocols for <b>multiple</b> <b>parties</b> to achieve this dual goal. The solution is distributed, i. e., there is no central, trusted party having {{access to all the}} data. Instead, we define a protocol using homomorphic encryption and digital envelope techniques to exchange the data while keeping it private...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} to a problem of data sharing among <b>multiple</b> <b>parties,</b> without disclosing the data between the parties. Our focus is data sharing among parties involved in a data mining task. We study how to share private or confidential data in the following scenario: <b>multiple</b> <b>parties,</b> each having a private data set, want to collaboratively conduct association rule mining without disclosing their private data to each other or any other parties. To tackle this demanding problem, we develop a secure protocol for <b>multiple</b> <b>parties</b> to conduct the desired computation. The solution is distributed, i. e., there is no central, trusted party having access to all the data. Instead, we define a protocol using homomorphic encryption techniques to exchange the data while keeping it private. Key Words: Privacy, security, association rule mining. ...|$|R

40|$|Privacy-preserving {{data mining}} seeks to empower {{conventional}} data mining techniques with the desirable property of preserving data privacy during the mining process. Given existing approaches on privacy-preserving decision tree induction for horizontally and vertically partitioned data involving <b>multiple</b> <b>parties,</b> we extend current work to <b>multiple</b> <b>parties</b> holding arbitrarily partitioned data. Although the extension is relatively straightforward, the difficulty lies in enabling <b>multiple</b> <b>parties</b> to securely perform the scalar product operation—a core operation in decision tree induction. In this paper, we propose {{the concept of}} Pseudo Scalar Product (PSP) to perform the secure scalar product operation more efficiently than existing approaches. PSP has computational and communication complexities of O(n) and O(mn) respectively, compared to O(mn) and O(mn 2) for existing approaches. The protocol for securely performing PSP is also more secure as {{it is able to}} protect each party’s privacy against up to n − 2 corrupted parties...|$|R
