50|$|The municipality’s arms {{might in}} English heraldic {{language}} be described thus: Tierced in mantle, dexter argent a lyre sable, sinister Or a lion rampant gules armed azure, and in base vert a <b>melting</b> <b>pan</b> over fire of the first.|$|E
50|$|The lyre {{is meant}} to express the municipality’s {{connection}} with music. The red lion is a charge formerly borne by the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves. The charges in base, the fire and <b>melting</b> <b>pan,</b> stand for the former Röderbach Iron Foundry, which stood within Hilscheid’s limits.|$|E
40|$|The X-ray {{diffraction}} is one {{experimental method}} very important on characterization solids compounds. In thecase of polycrystalline samples, the {{x-ray powder diffraction}} allows for {{the identification of the}} solid phase andthe characterization of structural changes. The present paper was prepared any antiferromagnetic ceramicphases, bicalcic ferrite derivate (Ca 2 Fe 2 O 5) by solid state reaction from pulverized reagents and mixed manually. These were heated in the Pt <b>melting</b> <b>pan,</b> in air oven at temperature between 1000 and 1450 oC for 12 h. Theoccurrence of reaction with reagents and the products obtained were identified and structurally characterized byX-ray diffraction by polycrystalline sample. Mixtures of regents CaCO 3, SrCO 3, BaCO 3, Fe 2 O 3, Nb 2 O 5, Have beenmade with various symmetries: a) Ba 2 Fe 2 O 5, b) CaBaFe 2 O 5, c) Ba 2 FeNbO 6, d) Ca 2 Fe 2 O 5, (e) Ba 2 Nb 2 O 7, (f) Ca 2 Nb 2 O 7, (g) Sr 2 Nb 2 O 7, (h) CaBaFeNbO 6. The products obtained showed that O 2 of the air participated ofreactions by providing the anions oxides required for obtaining the cubic phase. The formation of this phase was also helped by the presence of barium and niobium, since in the absence of these elements, can be seen theformation of orthorhombic phase, characteristic of Ca 2 Fe 2 O 5...|$|E
50|$|The fat {{is heated}} {{in a pot}} or <b>pan,</b> <b>melting</b> it if necessary. Then the flour is added. The mixture is heated and stirred until the flour is incorporated, and then cooked until at least the point where a raw flour taste is no longer {{apparent}} and the desired colour has been reached. The final colour can range from nearly white to nearly black, depending {{on the length of}} time it is heated and its intended use. The end result is a thickening and flavoring agent.|$|R
40|$|A {{differential}} scanning calorimetric {{survey of}} brominated PAN, pitch-based and vapor-grown fibers revealed that only vapor-grown fibers heat-treated to temperatures of 2250 C or above exhibited the phase change at 100 C {{associated with the}} two-dimensional melting of bromine, similar to that observed in HOPG. All the pitch-based fibers tested, as well as vapor-grown fibers annealed to 2250 C, showed a substantial decrease in resistivity upon bromination but gave no indication of a phase change, suggesting that the bromine in these fibers {{does not have the}} long-range order needed to undergo two-dimensional <b>melting.</b> The brominated <b>PAN</b> fibers and unannealed vapor-grown fibers showed no phase change and no change in resistivity, indicating that these fibers do not intercalate bromine...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{rheological}} {{behaviors of}} polyacrylonitrile/ionic liquids (PAN/ILs) melt were investigated {{to determine the}} general processing parameters and offer an important theoretical foundation of plasticized melt spinning. A step was carried out to decide the accurate temperature through the temperature sweep and time sweeps. The impacts of the concentration and temperature on the modulus of PAN/ILs samples were studied by dynamic sweeps. The three-parameter Carreau viscosity model was used to predict the zero-shear viscosity from the apparent viscosity data. The PAN/ILs melt showed shear-thinning behaviors. The <b>melt</b> with higher <b>PAN</b> concentration {{was found to be}} more sensitive to the temperature. However the structural viscosity index of the melt first decreased and then increased with the increase of temperature...|$|R
50|$|Homemade Jewish-style schmaltz is made {{by cutting}} chicken or goose fat into small pieces and <b>melting</b> in a <b>pan</b> over low-to-moderate heat, {{generally}} with onions. After {{the majority of the}} fat has been extracted, the melted fat is strained through a cheesecloth into a storage container. The remaining dark brown, crispy bits of skin and onion are known in Yiddish as gribenes. Another simple method is as a by-product of the making of chicken soup. After the chicken is simmered in the pot or crock-pot, the broth is chilled so the fat rises to the top and can be skimmed off, at once providing schmaltz to set aside for other uses and a lower-fat soup, which is brought back to heat before serving.|$|R
30|$|The {{measurement}} protocol was as follow: the dried sample {{was introduced in}} an empty pan and dried at 150 °C during 30 min in order to eliminate moisture. Then, the sample was kept at 300 °C during 5 min in order to melt it inside the <b>pan</b> (<b>melting</b> temperature of solar salt is 222 °C). Finally, the sample {{was introduced in the}} DSC and the following thermal cycle was used: isothermal of 10 min at 160 °C, heating from 160 °C to 420 °C at 20 °C/min, isothermal of 5 min at 420 °C, cooling from 420 °C to 160 °C at 40 °C/min. Only the heating ramp was used for the specific heat measurements. The heat flow data of the first thermal cycle (sample, empty pan, and sapphire) was discarded because it can be shifted due to thermal non-equilibrium issues. The measurement reproducibility was checked by repeating the calorimetric measurements five times in selected samples. The heat flow reproducibility agrees with the measurement uncertainty (± 3.5 %).|$|R
40|$|Premelting at {{the surface}} of ice {{crystals}} is caused by factors such as temperature, radius of curvature, and solute composition. When polycrystalline ice samples are warmed from well below the equilibrium melting point, surface melting may begin at temperatures as low as - 15 degrees C. However, {{it has been reported}} (. Biophys. J. 65 : 1853 - 1865) that when polycrystalline ice was warmed in a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) <b>pan,</b> <b>melting</b> began at about - 50 degrees C, this extreme behavior being attributed to short-range forces. We show that there is no driving force for such premelting, and that for pure water samples in DSC pans curvature effects will cause premelting typically at just a few degrees below the equilibrium melting point. We also show that the rate of warming affects the slope of the DSC baseline and that this might be incorrectly interpreted as an endotherm. The work has consequences for DSC operators who use water as a standard in systems where subfreezing runs are important...|$|R
5000|$|A commercially {{acquired}} [...] "melt and pour" [...] soap base is <b>melted</b> in a <b>pan</b> {{or commercial}} <b>melting</b> vessel, using direct heat, or {{in a water}} jacket melting pot, (large double boiler or [...] "bain marie"), and re-solidifies as it cools. Domestically, a microwave oven {{can be used for}} melting small quantities of the base. Additions can be added at the still-hot liquid stage, such as fragrance, fragrant essential oils, moisturizing agents, colorants, or exfoliating agents, e.g. poppy seeds, coffee grounds or pumice, along with coloured micas, metallic glitter, honey and flower heads. The liquified concoction can be poured into individual molds, tray molds, or blocks. Molds are made of metal or, more commonly, from reinforced silicone rubber, allowing artisans to make their own molds using a two-part mold kit. Upon cooling, the soap can be removed from the molds as individual soaps, or as blocks for slicing into bars. Layers of different colors, or transparent layers, can be built up, or pre-cast embeddable soap shapes, called embeds, can be set into the soap during moulding to produce novel patterns. Melt and pour bases can be transparent or opaque, and are sometimes enriched with products like goat's milk or shea butter to add value. The small-scale process lends itself to bespoke manufacture; a single soap bar can be individually manufactured if desired.|$|R
