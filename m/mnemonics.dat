5|$|Traditionally, Pre-Columbian Aztec {{writing has}} not been {{considered}} a true writing system, since it did not represent the full vocabulary of a spoken language {{in the way that}} the writing systems of the Old World or the Maya Script did. Therefore, generally Aztec writing was not meant to be read, but to be told. The elaborate codices were essentially pictographic aids for memorizing texts, which include genealogies, astronomical information, and tribute lists. Three kinds of signs were used in the system: pictures used as <b>mnemonics</b> (which do not represent particular words), logograms which represent whole words (instead of phonemes or syllables), and logograms used only for their sound values (i.e. used according to the rebus principle). However, epigrapher Alfonso Lacadena has argued that by the eve of the Spanish invasion, one school of Nahua scribes, those of Tetzcoco, had developed a fully syllabic script which could represent spoken language phonetically in the same way that the Maya script did. Some other epigraphers have questioned the claim, arguing that although the syllabicity was clearly extant in some early colonial manuscripts (hardly any pre-Columbian manuscripts have survived), this could be interpreted as a local innovation inspired by Spanish literacy rather than a continuation of a pre-Columbian practice.|$|E

40|$|Textual {{passwords}} {{are often}} the only mechanism used to authenticate users of a networked system. Unfortunately, many passwords are easily guessed or cracked. In an attempt to strengthen passwords, some systems instruct users to create <b>mnemonic</b> phrase-based passwords. A <b>mnemonic</b> password is one where a user chooses a memorable phrase and uses a character (often the first letter) to represent each word in the phrase. In this paper, we hypothesize that users will select <b>mnemonic</b> phrases that are commonly available on the Internet, {{and that it is}} possible to build a dictionary to crack <b>mnemonic</b> phrase-based passwords. We conduct a survey to gather user-generated passwords. We show the majority of survey respondents based their <b>mnemonic</b> passwords on phrases that can be found on the Internet, and we generate a <b>mnemonic</b> password dictionary as a proof of concept. Our 400, 000 -entry dictionary cracked 4 % of <b>mnemonic</b> passwords; in comparison, a standard dictionary with 1. 2 million entries cracked 11 % of control passwords. The usergenerated <b>mnemonic</b> passwords were also slightly more resistant to brute force attacks than control passwords. These results suggest that <b>mnemonic</b> passwords may be appropriate for some uses today. However, <b>mnemonic</b> passwords could become more vulnerable in the future and should not be treated as a panacea...|$|R

25|$|A Latin {{mnemonic}} verse or mnemonic rhyme is a mnemonic {{device for}} teaching and remembering Latin grammar. Such <b>mnemonics</b> have been considered by teachers {{to be an effective}} technique for schoolchildren to learn the complex rules of Latin accidence and syntax. One of their earliest uses was in the Doctrinale by Alexander of Villedieu written in 1199 as an entire grammar of the language comprising 2,000 lines of doggerel verse.

40|$|Effects {{of using}} <b>mnemonic</b> {{associations}} on vocabulary recall of Iranian EFL learners were investigated {{in two separate}} experiments with adolescents and adults. In each experiment, the students {{were divided into two}} groups of experimental (<b>mnemonic)</b> and control (rote). Using a number of predesigned (the researcher-designed) associations as models, the students of the <b>mnemonic</b> groups were trained to generate <b>mnemonic</b> associations of their own for the new vocabulary words they had chosen to learn. Then, their use of the initial (previously student-designed) and the new self-designed associations was assessed by giving four recall tasks. The students of the rote groups, on the other hand, were instructed to learn the words through memorization and repetition. The data analyzed revealed that using <b>mnemonic</b> associations led to significantly better performance of the adult students when comparison was made with an external control group (rote group) and better performance of both adult and adolescent groups when comparison was made with an internal control group (when students used no association in <b>mnemonic</b> group). Furthermore, the higher performance of <b>mnemonic</b> groups who frequently reported using initial associations revealed that these had a significant role at vocabulary recall of students. Finally, <b>mnemonic</b> method significantly affected the vocabulary recall of adult students for both receptive and productive learning...|$|R

However, the cross-reference tables only cite the most important threats. If the measure cited for a given threat is not applicable for the individual IT system, it is not superfluous. Baseline protection can only be ensured if all measures are realized.|$|E
25|$|Students {{studying}} Japanese as {{a foreign}} language are often required by a curriculum to acquire kanji without having first learned the vocabulary associated with them. Strategies for these learners vary from copying-based methods to mnemonic-based methods such as those used in James Heisig's series Remembering the Kanji. Other textbooks use methods based on the etymology of the characters, such as Mathias and Habein's The Complete Guide to Everyday Kanji and Henshall's A Guide to Remembering Japanese Characters. Pictorial <b>mnemonics,</b> as in the text Kanji Pict-o-graphix, are also seen.|$|E
25|$|An {{assembler}} program creates object code by translating combinations of <b>mnemonics</b> and syntax for operations and addressing modes into their numerical equivalents. This representation typically includes an operation code ("opcode") {{as well as}} other control bits and data. The assembler also calculates constant expressions and resolves symbolic names for memory locations and other entities. The use of symbolic references is a key feature of assemblers, saving tedious calculations and manual address updates after program modifications. Most assemblers also include macro facilities for performing textual substitution – e.g., to generate common short sequences of instructions as inline, instead of called subroutines.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors driving the development of memory during childhood is <b>mnemonic</b> control, or the capacity to initiate and maintain the processes that guide encoding and retrieval operations. The ability to selectively attend to and encode relevant stimuli is a particularly useful form of <b>mnemonic</b> control, and is one that undergoes marked improvement over childhood. We hypoth-esized that structural integrity of white matter tracts, in particular those connecting medial temporal lobe memory regions to other cor-tical areas, and/or those connecting frontal and parietal control regions, should contribute to successful <b>mnemonic</b> control. To test this hypothesis, we examined the relationship between structural integrity of selected white matter tracts and an experimental measure of <b>mnemonic</b> control, involving enhancement of memory by attention at encoding, in 116 children aged 7 – 11 and 25 young adults. We observed a positive relationship between integrity of unci-nate fasciculus and <b>mnemonic</b> enhancement across age groups. In adults, but not in children, we also observed an association between <b>mnemonic</b> enhancement and integrity of ventral cingulum bundle and ventral fornix/fimbria. Integrity of fronto-parietal tracts, including dorsal cingulum and superior longitudinal fasciculus, was unrelated to <b>mnemonic</b> enhancement...|$|R

500|$|The {{classification}} {{was originally}} enumerative, {{meaning that it}} listed all of the classes explicitly in the schedules. Over time it added some aspects of a faceted classification scheme, allowing classifiers to construct a number by combining a class number for a topic with an entry from a separate table. Tables cover commonly used elements such as geographical and temporal aspects, language, and bibliographic forms. For example, a class number could be constructed using 330 for economics + [...]9 for geographic treatment + [...]04 for Europe to create the class 330.94 European economy. Or one could combine the class 973 for United States + [...]05 for periodical publications on the topic {{to arrive at the}} number 973.05 for periodicals concerning the United States generally. The classification also makes use of <b>mnemonics</b> in some areas, such that the number 5 represents the country Italy in classification numbers like 945 (history of Italy), 450 (Italian language), 195 (Italian philosophy). The combination of faceting and <b>mnemonics</b> makes the classification synthetic in nature, with meaning built into parts of the classification number.|$|E
