40|$|Elements of {{the mission}} {{discourse}} of the Synoptic Gospels are found in <b>Mark</b> <b>6</b> : <b>6</b> b− 13; Matthew 9 : 35 − 10 : 15; Luke 9 : 1 − <b>6</b> and Luke 10 : 1 − 20. Similarities and differences in these accounts have led many New Testament scholars to posit {{the presence of a}} mission discourse in Q. This discourse, along with the parable that introduces it (Q 10 : 2), provides insight into how Q conceives of ‘mission’ as well as the ethical principles and precepts that are part of Jesus’ missional charge in this document. Through an intertextual approach to Q, with particular emphasis on narrative structure and imagery, this paper considered the interplay of mission and ethics in this early Christian text. This article is a revised version of a paper presented at the ‘Prestige FOCUS Conference on Mission and Ethics’ held at the University of Pretoria, South Africa from 14 − 16 September, 2011 in my capacity as a research associate of Prof. Dr Kobus Kok in the Department of New Testament Studies, Faculty of Theology, University of Pretoria in the research field of mission and ethics.

40|$|The {{complete}} {{nucleotide sequence}} of the Bacillus coagulans plasmid pBC 1 was determined. The sequence revealed an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 259 amino acids. This open reading frame shows sequence similarity to genes coding for replication-associated proteins {{in a group of}} gram-positive bacterial plasmids known to replicate via single-stranded intermediates. A region required for replication in cis, when the intact replicon is supplied in trans, was identified as well. The 1. <b>6</b> -kbp cryptic plasmid pBC 1 was originally isolated from a thermophilic strain of Bacillus coagulans (5). A genetically <b>marked</b> derivative, pLM <b>6</b> (<b>6),</b> was shown to replicate {{in a wide variety of}} gram-positive bacteria (such as bacilli, lactococci, and staphylococci). The elucidation of the plasmid replication mechanism is fundamental to further vector development and to use of pLM <b>6</b> as a cloning vector.
