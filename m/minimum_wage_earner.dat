50|$|In 2015, and {{continuing}} into 2016, {{the push for}} a $15/hour <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> among many <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> <b>earners</b> has increased fears among economists that increasing the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> will only lead to jobs being “techsourced”, automated, or eliminated entirely.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a simultaneous-equations model of firm closing and wage {{determination}} is developed {{in order to}} analyse how wages adjust to unfavorable shocks that raise the risk of displacement through firm closing, {{and to what extent}} a wage change affects the exit likelihood. The results show that the fear of job loss generates bargaining concessions instead of compensating differentials. A novel result that emerges from this study is that firms with a higher incidence of <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> <b>earners</b> are more vulnerable to adverse demand shocks due to their inability to adjust wages downward. In fact, <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> restrictions were seen to increase the failure rates. ...|$|R
30|$|We also {{assess the}} extent of nominal and real wage {{rigidity}} by main immigrant nationalities and find that the results are not homogeneous across different immigrant groups. The incidence of nominal wage rigidity among workers from Portuguese speaking countries in Africa (PALOP) is the lowest of all nationality groups considered, including the natives. This result {{is in line with}} most labour market theories that predict a lower wage rigidity for low-skilled blue-collar workers. The proportion of workers affected by downward real wage rigidity is the highest for immigrants from China, reflecting the greater concentration of these workers in the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage.</b> Excluding <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> <b>earners</b> from the sample, we obtain a lower incidence of real wage rigidity for Chinese immigrants than for natives.|$|R
30|$|The {{empirical}} part of {{the paper}} uses firm-level data obtained from a survey conducted within the WDN 3.

A question about the share of <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> <b>earners</b> in 2013 was included in the questionnaires of all nine countries (see Table 7 in the Appendix), and firms in all of them except Slovakia were asked about adjustment strategies they followed after the most recent rise in the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> (see Table 8 in the Appendix).|$|R
40|$|In view {{of rising}} wage and income inequality, the {{introduction}} of a legal <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> has recently become an important policy issue in Germany.

30|$|Up to 2006, {{the real}} wage {{rigidity}} measure combined both “strictly” real and institutional rigidities, related to collective bargaining and mandatory <b>minimum</b> <b>wages.</b> In {{the distribution of}} wage changes, the share of individuals covered by collective bargaining and/or earning the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> reinforced the spike at the expected inflation rate. In contrast, in 2007 and 2008, instead of having a two-spike distribution of wage changes, the distribution of wage changes has three spikes - at zero, at the expected inflation rate (and wage bargaining reference value), and {{at the rate of}} change of the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage.</b> In these years, the IWFP methodology only takes into account the non-zero spike that is more significant in the range of the estimated expected inflation rate. Hence, in both years, the focal points implicit in the real rigidity measures do not reflected the rate of change of the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> and the corresponding real rigidity measures do not include the percentage of <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> <b>earners</b> 11.

This sample was designed to include countries for which recent evidence has been missing prior to this paper. What is more, the study also overcomes the narrow focus of extant overviews that have typically focussed only on full-time employment.

40|$|Talk of a 'two-speed economy' was {{prevalent}} in Australia {{in the first}} half of 2010. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry argued against a significant increase in the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> on the basis that most <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> <b>earners</b> were employed in the 'slower' sectors of the Australian economy, where employers could not afford increased employment costs. This article considers the recent Fair Work Australia wage decision in the context of the argument that Australia has a two-speed economy. Using earnings and employment data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, we find that it is possible to identify significantly different patterns to the earnings outcomes experienced within specific sections of the Australian economy. There are some clear 'tracks', particularly between men and women in the private sector. The data suggest that the recent <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> decision will play an important role in countering labour market inequities, particularly those that are evident in Australia's gender pay gap. Further work remains to be done, however, and the forthcoming equal remuneration case will provide a further opportunity for Fair Work Australia to contribute to gender pay equity in Australia...|$|R
30|$|The average {{share of}} {{employees}} earning the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> {{in our sample}} varies quite significantly across countries, sectors, and occupations, but only partially across firm-size groups (see Table  2). There are several points to note from this. First, the WDN survey results show that fewer than 5 % of the employees of the average Estonian firm earn the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage,</b> whereas one third of a typical firm’s workforce are employed at the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> in Hungary and Romania. Second, the sector with the highest share of <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> <b>earners</b> differs across countries, as manufacturing has the largest share in Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Hungary, business services does in Latvia, Slovenia, and Slovakia, while construction has the largest proportion of workers employed at the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> in Estonia, Poland, and Romania. At {{the opposite end of}} the spectrum, energy and financial services have the smallest shares of their workers earning the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage.</b> Third, minimum-wage workers are more frequently employed by firms where low-skilled blue-collar workers are a dominant part of the workforce. Fourth, although the differences across firm-size categories are not very large, small firms with fewer than 50 employees are more likely to pay the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> than larger firms are. In Bulgaria and Hungary, however, the share of workers in large firms earning the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> is more significant, reflecting the higher share of workers on the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> in manufacturing.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the existence}} and extent of downward nominal wage rigidities in the Mexican labor market {{using data from the}} administrative records of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS). This longitudinal, firm-level dataset allows us to track workers employed with the same firm, observe their wage profiles and calculate the nominal-wage changes they experience over time. Based on the estimated density functions of nominal wage changes and other moments of the distribution, we are able to calculate several standard tests of nominal wage rigidity that have been proposed in the literature. Furthermore, we extend these tests {{to take into account the}} presence of <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> laws that may affect the distribution of nominal wage changes. The densities and tests calculated using these date are similar to those obtained using administrative data from other countries, and constitute a significant improvement over the measures of nominal wage rigidities obtained from household survey data. We find considerably more wage rigidity than previous estimates obtained for Mexico using data from the National Urban Employment Survey suggest. Furthermore, we find evidence that the extent of nominal wage rigidities has been falling over time.
