5|$|Quite often <b>milestone</b> {{home runs}} such as round hundred and career records are {{considered}} breaking news, and sports news services give coverage to countdowns on impending <b>milestone</b> home runs.

40|$|Introduction. A {{safe and}} {{effective}} transition from hospital to post-acute care is a complex and important physician competency. <b>Milestones</b> and Entrustable Professional Activities (EPA) form the new educational rubric in Graduate Medical Education Training. “A {{safe and effective}} discharge from the hospital” is an EPA ripe for educational innovation. Methods. The authors collaborated in a qualitative process called mapping to define 22 of 142 Internal Medicine (IM) curricular <b>milestones</b> related to the transition of care. Fifty-five participant units at an Association for Program Directors in Internal Medicine (APDIM) workshop prioritized the <b>milestones,</b> using a validated ranking process called Q-sort. We analyzed the Q-sort results, which rank the <b>milestones</b> in order of priority. We then applied this ranking to three innovative models of training IM residents in the transitions of care: Simulation (S), Discharge Clinic Feedback (DCF) and TRACER (T). Results. We collected 55 Q-sort rankings from particpants at the APDIM workshop. We then identified which <b>milestones</b> are a focus of the three innovative models of training in the transition of care: Simulation = 5 of 22 <b>milestones,</b> Discharge Clinic Feedback = 9 of 22 <b>milestones,</b> and TRACER = 7 of 22 <b>milestones.</b> <b>Milestones</b> identified in each innovation related {{to one of the}} top 8 prioritized <b>milestones</b> 75 % of the time; thus, more frequently than the <b>milestones</b> with lower priority. Two <b>milestones</b> are shared by all three curricula: Utilize patient-centered education and Ensure succinct written communication. Two other <b>milestones</b> are shared by two curricula: Manage and coordinate care transitions across multiple delivery systems and Customize care {{in the context of the}} patient’s preferences. If you combine the three innovations, all of the top 8 <b>milestones</b> are included. Discussion. The <b>milestones</b> give us a context to share individual innovations and to compare and contrast using a standardized frame. We demonstrate that the three unique discharge curricula in aggregate capture all of the highest prioritized <b>milestones</b> for this discharge EPA...|$|R
40|$|<b>Milestoning</b> is a {{procedure}} {{to compute the}} time evolution of complicated processes such as barrier crossing events or long diffusive transitions between predefined states. <b>Milestoning</b> reduces the dynamics to transition events between intermediates (the <b>milestones)</b> and computes the local kinetic information to describe these transitions via short molecular dynamics (MD) runs between the <b>milestones.</b> The procedure relies {{on the ability to}} reinitialize MD trajectories on the <b>milestones</b> to get the right kinetic information about the transitions. It also rests on the assumptions that the transition events between successive <b>milestones</b> and the time lags between these transitions are statistically independent. In this paper, we analyze the validity of these assumptions. We show that sets of optimal <b>milestones</b> exist, i. e., sets such that successive transitions are indeed statistically independent. The proof of this claim relies on the results of transition path theory and uses the isocommittor surfaces of the reaction as <b>milestones.</b> For systems in the overdamped limit, we also obtain the probability distribution to reinitialize the MD trajectories on the <b>milestones,</b> and we discuss why this distribution is not available in closed form for systems with inertia. We explain why the time lags between transitions are not statistically independent even for optimal <b>milestones,</b> but we show that working with such <b>milestones</b> allows one to compute mean first passage times between <b>milestones</b> exactly. Finally, we discuss some practical implications of our results and we compare <b>milestoning</b> with Markov state models in view of our findings. © 2008 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

40|$|<b>Milestoning</b> is a {{computational}} {{procedure that}} reduces the dynamics of complex systems to memoryless jumps between intermediates, or <b>milestones,</b> and only retains some information about the probability of these jumps and the time lags between them. Here we analyze a variant of this procedure, termed optimal <b>milestoning,</b> which relies on a specific choice of <b>milestones</b> to capture exactly some kinetic features of the original dynamical system. In particular, we prove that optimal <b>milestoning</b> permits the exact calculation of the mean first passage times (MFPT) between any two <b>milestones.</b> In so doing, we also analyze another variant of the method, called exact <b>milestoning,</b> which also permits the exact calculation of certain MFPTs, but {{at the price of}} retaining more information about the original system's dynamics. Finally, we discuss importance sampling strategies based on optimal and exact <b>milestoning</b> {{that can be used to}} bypass the simulation of the original system when estimating the statistical quantities used in these methods.
