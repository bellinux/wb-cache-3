40|$|OBJETIVO: avaliar as proporções faciais, em jovens <b>melanodermas</b> e leucodermas do sexo feminino, dos 8 aos 10 anos de idade, e verificar as possíveis diferenças existentes entre os grupos. MÉTODOS : os autores examinaram, de forma transversal, 70 telerradiografias {{realizadas}} em norma lateral, igualmente divididas entre os dois grupos, sendo 22 aos 8 anos, 18 aos 9 anos e 30 aos 10 anos. Todas as pacientes apresentavam perfil facial harmonioso e oclusão normal, e ausência de tratamento ortodôntico prévio. Avaliaram-se as proporções AFAI/AFAT (ENA-Me/N-Me), AFPT/AFAT (S-Go/N-Me), AFPI/AFPT (Ar-Go/S-Go) e AFPI/AFAI (Ar-Go/ENA-Me). Os dados foram analisados por meio da estatística descritiva, teste t de Student para a comparação entre os grupos raciais, análise de variância com teste de Bonferroni para comparação entre as idades e coeficiente de correlação de Pearson para a verificação do grau de associação entre as proporções faciais. Em todos os testes estatísticos utilizou-se o nível de 5 % de significância. RESULTADOS: não existiram diferenças estatisticamente significativas entre os grupos e entre as idades dentro dos grupos, independentemente da variável analisada. CONCLUSÃO: não ocorreram diferenças estatisticamente significativas nas proporções faciais entre jovens leucodermas e <b>melanodermas</b> brasileiras. As proporções faciais mantiveram-se constantes dos 8 aos 10 anos de idade, independentemente do grupo racial. AIM: To {{evaluate the}} vertical facial proportions of Afro Brazilian and White Brazilian female children aged 8 to 10 years old, and {{to evaluate the}} differences between the racial groups. METHODS: The authors evaluated 70 cephalometric radiographs, in lateral norm, equally divided into two groups, 22 at 8 years, 18 at 9 years, and 30 at 10 years old. All the patients showed harmonious facial esthetics, normal occlusion and none of them were subjected to previous orthodontic treatment. The following proportions were evaluated: LAFH/TAFH (ANS-Me/N-Me), TPFH/TAFH (S-Go/N-Me), LPFH/PTFH (Ar-Go/S-Go), LPFH/LAFH (Ar-Go/ANS-Me). Data was analyzed by descriptive statistics and Student's t-test in order to compare {{the differences between the}} racial groups, ANOVA for comparison between the ages and Pearson's correlation coefficient to examine the level of association between the variables.

40|$|The {{density in}} melanin chromatophores becomes {{heterogeneous}} in the epidermis {{during the early}} events of photoaging. Little {{is known about the}} regional variability in the resulting mottled skin appearance on the sun-exposed parts of the body in the elderly. The relationship between these features and the dermal atrophy related to aging is also an area ripe for study. The aim {{of the present study was}} to objectively assess and compare such aspects of photoaging in older subjects. A computer-assisted video camera equipped with an internal ultraviolet-emitting unit (Visioscan) was used in combination with image analysis to quantify the infraclinical mottling of the skin on the forehead, neck and dorsal forearm. A Densi Score device served to assess the dermal atrophy by rating the skin folding capacity. A mottled subclinical <b>melanoderma</b> was disclosed on the three evaluation sites in all subjects irrespective of their phototypes. Three main patterns were identified corresponding to regular perifollicular dots, streaky macules along shallow wrinkles and unevenly shaped macules in the interfollicular area. The extent in <b>melanoderma</b> was larger on the forehead than on the neck and forearm. The age after 60 years did not influence the severity of mottled <b>melanoderma,</b> but clearly altered the skin folding capacity. The greatest inter-individual differences in mottled <b>melanoderma</b> were found in phototype II subjects. In conclusion, infraclinical mottled <b>melanoderma</b> is present in all individuals after 60 years of age. This type of epidermal photoaging does not appear to be influenced in older ages.

40|$|Cutaneous cancers are not {{uncommon}} {{on the face of}} elderly patients. Melanin should protect, at least in part, against the ultraviolet (UV) -induced neoplastic damage. However, the density in melanin chromatophores is heterogeneous in the epidermis of Caucasian adults. The computerized UV light-enhanced visualization (ULEV) method is a sensitive tool to assess non-invasively this mosaic pattern of intra-epidermal melanin load. In this study, the combination of ULEV pattern analysis and image analysis were performed involving four groups of phototype III Caucasian subjects. The first group was composed of 55 patients aged from 65 to 75 years who suffered from several malignancies of facial skin. The second control group of 55 patients who never had developed skin cancers were matched with the first group for age, sex and phototype. The third group was composed of 80 patients aged from 49 to 59 years who had developed a single basal cell carcinoma. The fourth group comprised 80 age, sex and phototype-matched healthy control subjects. Irrespective of the groups of subjects, a correlation was found between the pattern grading and the objectively determined relative area of subclinical <b>melanoderma.</b> Patients with multiple skin cancers differed from the other groups by the fact that a significantly higher proportion of them exhibited an extensive type of subclinical <b>melanoderma.</b> This feature was also seen in a minority of patients with a single basal cell carcinoma.

In our previous paper, we demonstrated that the anti-diabetic drug voglibose, a valiolamine derivative, is a potent anti-melanogenic agent. In addition, we proposed an alternative screening strategy to identify valiolamine derivatives with high skin permeability that act as anti-melanogenic agents when applied topically. In this study, we synthesized several valiolamine derivatives with enhanced lipophilicity and examined their inhibitory effects in a human skin model. N-(2 -hydroxycyclohexyl) valiolamine (HV) possesses a stronger inhibitory effect on melanin production than voglibose in a human skin model, suggesting that HV is a more potent anti-melanogenic agent for the skin...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mottled {{subclinical}} <b>melanoderma</b> (MSM) {{is frequently}} seen on facial skin using the ultraviolet light enhanced visualization (ULEV) method. The corresponding aspect on the hairless scalp remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To explore the field distribution of melanin on the scalp of fair-skinned Caucasian subjects. METHOD: The scalp was examined in 43 men with androgenic alopecia. The Visioscan((R)) camera provided the ULEV pictures. Another optical (Visioface((R)) Quick) device was used under white light illumination followed by colour contrast enhancement. This was reached after specific computer filtration of the cyan hue wavelengths. RESULTS: Under white light illumination, the scalp looked normal. MSM patterns were disclosed by both optical procedures as evenly scattered discrete patchy fields of hypermelanosis. The smaller rounded spots were {{restricted to the}} lips of the hair infundibula. Larger irregularly shaped spots predominated in the interfollicular areas. A few hypomelanotic spots were scattered over the scalp.

Several patterns of mosaic subclinical <b>melanoderma</b> (MSM) {{have been described}} using a specially designed CCD camera and the ultraviolet light-enhanced visualization (ULEV) method. Vitamin D(3) and its analogues influence the biology of keratinocytes and melanocytes. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of calcipotriol on MSM. METHODS: This randomized split-face {{study was conducted in}} 27 men to compare the effect of once daily applications of 5 % calcipotriol cream or a moisturizing cream on the heterogeneity of facial MSM. Computerized image analysis of video images was used at 1 -month intervals before and during a 2 -month treatment, as well as during a 3 -month follow-up. RESULTS: At both sites, the average melanin content of the epidermis showed no significant change over time. However, the mottled appearance was smoothened at the calcipotriol site, whereas it was increased at the site receiving the moisturizer.

40|$|Based on the {{clinical}} presentation of some skin pigmentation disorders {{it is thought that}} a bicompartmental functional system exists in the epidermal melanocyte population. It corresponds to the perifollicular and interfollicular compartments, respectively. The present study was undertaken looking for the presence of such a system on scalp unaffected by pigmentary disorders. The scalps of 100 men with incipient to severe androgenic alopecia were examined using a videocamera equipped with an internal ultraviolet light-emitting unit. The face, trunk and limbs were similarly examined in 45 of these adults and in 13 children of both sexes. In 92 men, a subclinical hypermelanosis was found as a speckled pattern centered on every single follicle. With increasing baldness severity, another epidermal hyperpigmentation pattern involving the interfollicular area was superimposed to the perifollicular pattern. These stereotyped patterns of subclinical <b>melanoderma</b> were also disclosed on the face of adults, but not in children. In addition, the spotty perifollicular pattern was discrete or not apparent on the other parts of the body. It is concluded that the perifollicular subclinical melanotic pattern is a regional characteristic of cephalic skin, perhaps related to the local production of melanocortins, particularly alpha-MSH by the pilosebaceous unit.

40|$|Skin {{weathering}} and photoaging of the balding scalp {{have not}} attracted much investigative attention so far. However, {{the concept of}} field cancerization, in particular actinic field carcinogenesis, is likely applicable to this body region. The aim {{of the study was}} to finetune the epidermal actinic changes present on hairlessness scalp. The ultraviolet light-enhanced visualization (ULEV) method was used to assess a series of 50 healthy men older than 50 years with documented baldness for over 15 years. They were scrutenized looking for altered epidermal structures corresponding to photoaging-associated changes. Attention was focused on the faint mosaic <b>melanoderma</b> (FMM) and atypical scaliness. Observations were made on the scalp and forehead. FMM was recognized in each case. It presented either as a single manifestation of photoaging or it was associated with an unusual pattern of discrete rimmed scaliness. In this latter case histology and morphometry disclosed keratinocyte dysplasia. A similar scaly pattern was not seen on the forehead. Subtle skin surface changes were disclosed on long-standing sun-exposed balding scalps. The scaly aspect was distinct from dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis or any other common inflammatory scalp dermatosis. The presently described changes had not previously been described during early balding.

40|$|Background: Human {{cutaneous}} {{malignant melanoma}} (CMM) is an aggressive cancer showing a dramatic worldwide increase in incidence {{over the past}} few decades. The most prominent relative epidemiological increase has been disclosed in young women. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the effects of chronic sun exposures in order to rate the extend of melanocytic stimulations in the vicinity of CMM. Methods: The study was designed to evaluate the melanin distribution and density using ultraviolet light illumination. The present study was performed on surgical excision specimens of thin CMM lesion removed from the upper limbs of 55 Caucasian adults (37 women and 18 men). Two control groups comprised 23 men and 21 women of similar ages who had medium-size congenital melanocytic nevi, also present on the upper limbs. The peritumoral skin was scrutinized using a Visioscan® VC 98 device, revealing the faint mosaic <b>melanoderma</b> (FMM) pattern that grossly indicates early signs of chronic photodamage in epidermal melanin units. Results: The median extent of relative FMM was significantly higher in the CMM male group. By contrast, the CMM female group showed a reverse bimodal distribution in FMM size. Only 12 / 37 (32. 5 %) of the CMM female group had an increased FMM size, whereas 25 / 37 (67. 5 %) of females with CMM had a global FMM extent in the normal range, relative to the controls.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Scarring is {{a complex}} process {{involving}} many cell types, cytokines and biological pathways including mechanobiology. Some subtle mechanical properties of skin can be assessed by measuring the speed of ultrasound shear wave propagation. The orientation of abnormal skin tension forces can be visualized, particularly in darker skin types, using dermoscopy showing distinct patterns of rete ridges' conformation. AIM: To assess some mechanobiological features of scars in darker skin types. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Large atrophic and hypertrophic surgical scars were examined on the trunk of 35 darker skin subjects. The surrounding skin {{was used as a}} comparator. Dermoscopic aspects were recorded. Resonance running time measurements (RRTM) were performed using a shear wave propagation device (Reviscometer). They were performed in four specific directions at given angles with regard to the long axis of the scar. The minimum, maximum and mean RRTM values were recorded at each site. RESULTS: Dermoscopy revealed patterns of melanin deposits in scars distinct from the normal honeycomb network seen in the surrounding skin. Hypertrophic scars showed a patchy pattern of large macular <b>melanoderma</b> dispersed in a lighter background. In these cases, low RRTM values were obtained with little variations according to the orientation of the measurements. By contrast, atrophic scars showed a streaky laddering melanotic pattern under dermoscopy. Higher RRTM values were often obtained, particularly in the transversal direction of the scars. Mechanical anisotropy was greater in the atrophic scars compared with the normal skin. DISCUSSION: Darker skin types represent a model for visualizing the main orientation of the epidermal rete ridges. A correlation was found between the pattern of melanized rete ridges of scars and the main orientation of the intrinsic forces in the skin. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{bottom line}} Lorenzo's oil has no value in {{patients}} with established symp-toms. It may be of value of asumptomatic patients, and may delay onset of symptoms, but the extent of any effect is un-clear. The {{problem is that the}} fatty acids in Lorenzo's oil do not replace the very long chgain fatty acids in the brain be-cause they do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Background Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a rare (incidence about 1 in 45, 000), genetic disorder characterized by the breakdown or loss of the myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells in the brain and progressive dysfunction of the adrenal gland. ALD is {{one of a group of}} genetic disorders called the leukodystrophies that cause damage to the myelin sheath, the fatty covering — which acts as an insulator — on nerve fibers in the brain. There are several forms of ALD. Onset of the classic child-hood form, which is the most severe and affects only boys, may occur between ages 4 and 10. Features of this form may include visual loss, learning disabilities, seizures, dysarthria (poorly articulated speech), dysphagia (difficulty swallow-ing), deafness, disturbances of gait and coordination, fa-tigue, intermittent vomiting, <b>melanoderma</b> (increased skin pigmentation), and progressive dementia. The most com-mon symptoms are usually behavioral changes such as ab-normal withdrawal or aggression, poor memory, and poor school performance. In the milder adult-onset form (also called adrenomyeloneuropathy, or AMN), which typically begins between ages 21 and 35, symptoms may include leg stiff-ness, progressive spastic paraparesis (stiffness, weakness and/or paralysis) of the lower extremities, and ataxia. Al-though adult-onset ALD progresses more slowly than the classic childhood form, it can also result in deterioration of brain function. Another form of ALD is occasionally seen in women who are carriers of the disorder. Symptoms are mild and may include spastic paraparesis of the lower limbs, ataxia, hyper-tonia (excessive muscle tone), mild peripheral neuropathy, and urinary problems. Neonatal ALD affects both male an...|$|E

The most prominent relative epidemiological increase has been disclosed in young women. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the effects of chronic sun exposures in order to rate the extend of melanocytic stimulations in the vicinity of CMM. Methods: The study was designed to evaluate the melanin distribution and density using ultraviolet light illumination. The present study was performed on surgical excision specimens of thin CMM lesion removed from the upper limbs of 55 Caucasian adults (37 women and 18 men). Two control groups comprised 23 men and 21 women of similar ages who had medium-size congenital melanocytic nevi, also present on the upper limbs. The peritumoral skin was scrutinized using a Visioscan® VC 98 device, revealing the faint mosaic <b>melanoderma</b> (FMM) pattern that grossly indicates early signs of chronic photodamage in epidermal melanin units. Results: The median extent of relative FMM was significantly higher in the CMM male group. By contrast, the CMM female group showed a reverse bimodal distribution in FMM size. Only 12 / 37 (32. 5 %) of the CMM female group had an increased FMM size, whereas 25 / 37 (67. 5 %) of females with CMM had a global FMM extent in the normal range, relative to the controls. Conclusion: Thin CMM supervening in young women appear unrelated to repeat photoexposure. Other mechanisms are possibly involved.

40|$|Da bi ustanovili postojanje kroničnog trovanja arsenom autori su izvršili pregled 158 radnika preduzeća »Elektrobosna« eksponiranih arsenu te 152 radnika. iz kontrolne grupe. Arsena su našli u tragovima u mokraći, noktima i vlasima, dok je u okolnom zraku arsen bio neznatno povišen. Uspoređivanjern obje grupe pregledanih radnika nađeno je da je statistički značajna bila jedino prevalencija laringitisa u eksponiranoj grupi. Anamnestički podaci su otkrili da je akutni {{hepatitis}} bio daleko češći u toj grupi a i značajno češće su bile melanoderme, hiperkeratoze i promjene na noktima. In the »Elcktrobosna« {{works in}} Jajce, Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the authors earlier identified arsenic {{in the working}} environment, 158 workers were examined for the symptoms of chronic arsenic poisoning. Health examinations consisted of medical and dermatological investigations. The findings were compared with those obtained in a control group, homologous by age and sex, from the gypsum factory at Volari, 20 km from Jajce. The total number of male workers examined in »Elelctrobosna« was 158 and in the gypsum factory at Volari 152. Their age distribution is presented un Table 1. The chemical analysis of urine, nails and hair for the traces of arsenic did not show differences. The analysis of air samples taken in {{one day in the}} vicinity of »Elektrobosna«, Jajce and the gypsum factory, Volari (Table 2) showed only a slight increase of AsH 3 around »Elektrobosna«. This was to be expected since AsH 3 occurs in the air on wet days in the course of ferrosilicium production. The differences. in medical findings between the exposed and control group of workers did not prove statistically significant, except for a much higher prevalence of laryngitis ( 2 = 7. 82) in relation to the table value of 6. 63, with P equaling 99. Anamnestic data show a much higher incidence of acute hepatitis (Table 4) among exposed workers. The greatest differences in findings between exposed and control workers were obtained by dermatological examinations (Table 5). Among exposed workers a significantly higher prevalence was found for <b>melanoderma,</b> hyperkeratosis, leukomelanoderma and the nail changes...|$|E
40|$|PHOTOS 1 - 3 : Alopecia is {{abnormal}} hair loss {{or failure of}} hair to grow and occurs {{in a variety of}} conditions. Alopecia areata causes patchy alopecia. Alopecia areata is the result of cellular and humoral immune response against hair follicle antigens. It is a spontaneously occurring, non pruritic focal to multifocal condition. The patchy areas of alopecia may give the coat a moth eaten appearance. Hyperpigmentation (<b>melanoderma)</b> may develop in the alopecic skin. In dogs with multicoloured coats the alopecia may first occur in the pigmented areas. The lesions occur most commonly on the head, neck and legs. Facial lesions are usually bilaterally symmetrical. Alopecia areata is diagnosed via dermatohistopathology. There is no specific treatment for alopecia areata and spontaneous hair regrowth may be seen. Hair that regrows may be permanently white. PHOTOS 4 - 10 : Alopecia X is an uncommon condition in dogs that may be due to local follicular receptor dysregulation, hyperadrenocorticism, growth hormone deficiency, adrenal sex hormone imbalance or excessive production of androgenic steroids. It usually occurs in dogs between 2 and 5 years of age and occurs in Chow Chows, Pomeranians, Keeshonds, Samoyeds, Alaskan Malamutes, Siberian huskies and miniature poodles. Hair loss is seen from the neck, tail, caudodorsum, perineum and caudal thighs. The alopecia becomes generalized over the trunk but the head and front limbs are spared. Hair loss is bilaterally symmetrical and the remaining hairs epilate easily. The alopecic skin may become hyperpigmented, thin and hypotonic with or without secondary seborrhoea and superficial pyoderma. Diagnosis is via dermatohistopathology and ACTH stimulation test. A variety of medical therapies are available to stimulate hair regrowth. Neutering intact dogs may induce hair regrowth. Canine hypothyroidism is a more common condition in dogs which also causes alopecia. Alopecia on the bridge of the nose is an early symptom of this condition. The hair coat may be dull, dry and brittle with bilaterally symmetrical alopecia that spares the extremities. The alopecic skin may be hyperpigmented and thickened. Secondary yeast infections of seborrheic skin are common.
