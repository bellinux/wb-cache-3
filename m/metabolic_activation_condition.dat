40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{changes in the}} mutagenic activity of organic fractions from soil contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) during pilot-scale bioslurry remediation. Slurry samples were previously analyzed for changes in PAH and polycyclic aromatic compound content, and {{this study examined the}} correspondence between the chemical and toxicological metrics. Nonpolar neutral and semipolar aromatic fractions of samples obtained on days 0, 3, 7, 24, and 29 of treatment were assayed for mutagenicity using the Salmonella mutation assay. Most samples elicited a significant positive response on Salmonella strains TA 98, YG 1041, and YG 1042 with and without S 9 metabolic activation; however, TA 100 failed to detect mutagenicity in any sample. Changes in the mutagenic activity of the fractions across treatment time and <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> <b>conditions</b> suggests a pattern of formation and transformation of mutagenic compounds that may include a wide range of PAH derivatives such as aromatic amines, oxygenated PAHs, and S-heterocyclic compounds. The prior chemical analyses documented the formation of oxygenated PAHs during the treatment (e. g., 4 -oxapyrene- 5 -one), and the mutagenicity analyses showed high corresponding activity in the semipolar fraction with and without <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation.</b> However, it could not be verified that these specific compounds were the underlying cause of the observed changes in mutagenic activity. The results highlight the need for concurrent chemical and toxicological profiling of contaminated sites undergoing remediation to ensure elimination of priority contaminants as well as a reduction in toxicological hazard. Moreover, the results imply that remediation efficacy and utility be evaluated using both chemical and toxicological metrics. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 2009. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

Measurements were made after an overnight fast before and hourly during 3 h after test meal ingestion. Test meals consisted of either pure carbohydrates, protein or fat and were served as isoenergetic (1670 kJ) spoonable creams with similar sensory properties.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) {{are believed to}} be among the causative agents for lung cancer in smokers. Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a prototypic carcinogenic PAH, which requires <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> to elicit its detrimental effects. The major end product of its diol epoxide <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> pathway is r- 7,t- 8, 9,c- 10 -tetrahydroxy- 7, 8, 9, 10 -tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (trans, anti-BaPT). Individual differences in exposure to, and <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> of, carcinogenic PAH may influence cancer risk. Measurement of PAH metabolites in human urine could provide a direct way to assess individual differences in susceptibility to PAH-related cancer. We developed a sensitive and reliable method for quantitation of trans, anti-BaPT in human urine using gas chromatography-negative ion chemical ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-NICI-MS/MS). A unique phenotyping strategy using [D 10]PheT as probes have been developed, allowing direct assessment of <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> of carcinogenic PAH in humans. We investigated [D 10]phenanthrene metabolism in smokers after administration by inhalation in cigarette smoke or orally. Sixteen smokers received 10 µg [D 10]phenanthrene in a cigarette or orally. Plasma and urine samples were analyzed for [D 10]r- 1,t- 2, 3,c- 4 -tetrahydroxy- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydrophenanthrene ([D 10]PheT), the major end product of the diol epoxide pathway, by gas chromatography-negative ion chemical ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. The ratios of [D 10]PheT (oral dosing: inhalation) in 15 smokers were 1. 03 ± 0. 32 and 1. 02 ± 0. 35, based on plasma AUC 0 -&# 8734; and total 48 hr urinary excretion, respectively. Overall {{there was no significant difference}} in the extent of [D 10]PheT formation after the two different routes of exposure in smokers. Its application in clinical studies has approved, for the first time, that there is large inter-individual variation in PAH <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> in smokers. One striking finding is that the formation of PAH diol epoxides, the ultimate carcinogen, occurs astonishingly rapidly in smokers, particularly after inhalation of cigarette smoke. The pharmacokinetics parameters of PAH metabolites in humans have also been presented.

However, the application of tertiary techniques should be thoroughly examined for their potential hazardous effects.

In this study, Ames test and Microtox test {{were used for the}} evaluation of ozonation efficiency to upgrade secondary effluents quality. In general, the toxic response and mutagenic effect without <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> of test species were influenced mainly by the ozone dose and ozonation duration, whereas the mutagenic effect with <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> was influenced mainly by ozone dose, indicating that ozone conditions strongly affect the formation of by-products.

On the contrany, in most cases the mutagenic activity towards strain TA 98 without <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> was reduced, when ozone dose and contact time increased, However, the mutagenicity was also increased after ozonation at low ozone doses and for contact times less than 5 min.

Whilst it is possible that chronic exposure to excessive amounts of alcohol does predispose patients with paracetamol overdose to hepatotoxicity, a critical review of the literature reveals that the evidence to date does not support this.

No effect was observed with ampicillin, cadmium chloride, cyclophosphamide, griseofulvin, the insoluble Cr(VI) compound lead chromate, the soluble Cr(III) compounds chromium nitrate, chromium chloride, chromium potassium sulphate, and the chelating agent sodium nitrilotriacetate. Among the Cr(III) compounds only chromium acetate produced a low but significant increase of SOS inducing activity. Solubilization by nitrilotriacetate of genotoxic Cr(VI) from insoluble lead chromate was observed, whereas no interaction occurred between nitrilotriacetate and the soluble Cr(VI) and Cr(III) compounds. Using urinary XAD- 2 extracts, we found the SOS Chromotest poorly sensitive to the mutagens present in urine from tobacco smokers which, on the other hand, were detected by the gene mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium (Ames test). A urine sample obtained from a psoriatic patient, therapeutically treated with mineral coal tar, had a significant SOS inducing activity with and even without <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation,</b> whereas in the Ames test it was active only in the presence of <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation.</b> These results indicate that the SOS Chromotest, although poorly sensitive to urinary mutagens, could detect genotoxic compounds different from those detected by the Salmonella/microsome assay...|$|R

40|$|N-nitrosopiperidine (NPIP) is {{a potent}} esophageal carcino-gen in rats whereas {{structurally}} similar N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) induces liver, but not esophageal tumors. NPIP is a possible causative agent for human esophageal cancer. Our goal is to explain mechanistically these differing carcinogenic activities in the esophagus. We hypothesize that differences in <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> of these nitrosamines could be one factor accounting for their differing carcinogenicity. α-Hydroxylation is the key <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> pathway leading to nitrosamine-induced carcinogenesis. In this study, we examined the α-hydroxylation rates of [3, 4 - 3 H]NPIP and [3, 4 - 3 H]NPYR by male F 344 rat esophageal and liver micro-somes. The major α-hydroxylation products of NPIP and NPYR, 2 -hydroxytetrahydro- 2 H-pyran (2 -OH-THP) and 2 -hydroxytetrahydrofuran (2 -OH-THF), respectively, wer...|$|R
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThe {{antimutagenic}} {{activity of}} chlorophyllin and hematin was investigated with the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 98 and TA 100 {{by means of}} the Amestest. Benzo(a) pyrene, the food pyrolysate 2 -amino- 1 -methyl- 6 - phenylimidazo [4, 5]pyridine or PhIP and 2 - aminoanthracene were used as mutagens in most experiments. These agents exert mutagenic activity only in the presence of mamalian <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation.</b> In all experiments the mutagenic activity of the three chemicals could be abolished by the presence of 2 mg of chlorophyllin or 0, 5 mg of hematin per selection plate. Considering the results of experiments in which chlorophyllin and hematin were added at several different times after the addition of the <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> system it was concluded that the formed mutagenic metabolites were trapped and inactivated by these porfyrines. The antimutagenic activities of these porfyrines decreased when the porfyrine ring was destroyed as appeared from experiments with biliverdin and bilirubin. Due to its low solubility the antimutagenic activity of chlorophyll is not or nearly not demonstrable. The antimutagenic activity of chlorophyllin or hematin on substances that are mutagenic in the absence of <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> such as MNNG, furazolidone, dimetridazole, epichlorohydrin and 2 -chloroethanol is lower or absent...|$|R

The root bark contains diketones, fatty matter, rubber, dulcitol, mangiferin, phlobatannin and glycosidal tannins. Roots are astringent, abortifacient and a decoction is useful in amenorrhoea, dysmenorrhoea and venereal disorders. The plant was evaluated with a series of genotoxicity studies in order to confirm the safety of its usage. It showed no mutagenicity up to 5 mg/plate when tested with Salmonella typhimurium TA 97 a, TA 98, TA 100, TA 102 and TA 1535 strains with or without <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation.</b> On the other hand Magiferin from Salacia chinensis Linn shows a significant protective effect against mutagenicity induced by mutagen in S. typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100 strain with or without <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation.</b> Similarly, in vitro chromosomal aberration assay did not reveal any significant alterations up to 5 mg/culture as compared to the negative control both in the presence and absence of the <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation</b> (S 9 mix). The results of these studies indicate that Magiferin from Salacia chinensis Linn is non-mutagenic in AMES test, exhibit protection against the mutagenicity induced by 4 -nitroquinolene- 1 -oxide, sodium azide and 2 -aminoflourene in TA 98 and TA 100 strain and non-clastogenic in in-vitro chromosomal aberration study...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the {{mutagenic}} potential of CVA 1020 using the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) with bacteria and in vitro chromosomal aberration test with mammalian cells. In the reverse mutation test, Salmonella typhimurium TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535 and TA 1537 and Escherichia coli [WP 2 (uvrA) ] were used with the dose range from 0. 0015 to 0. 16 µg/plate in triplicates with and without S 9 activation. In the chromosomal aberration test with mammalian cells, a Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line (CHL/IU) in culture was used at dose levels 0. 34, 0. 69, 1. 37, 2. 75 and 5. 50 mg/mL in the absence and presence of the <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation.</b> CVA 1020 induced no significant increases in the number of revertants in any of the strains at the dose levels where antibacterial effects were not noted with and without <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation.</b> CVA 1020 did not induce increase in the incidence of cells with chromosomal aberration or those with genome mutation (polyploidy) in any of the strains irrespective of the absence or presence of <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation.</b> Thus, based on these results it is concluded that CVA 1020 does not have mutagenic potential...|$|R
