5|$|Following the Olympics, <b>Meissner</b> {{returned}} to Baltimore. On the return flight, she partially ruptured {{one of her}} eardrums and fully ruptured the other. This affected her hearing as she trained for the 2006 World Championships, her first senior ISU Championship. At Worlds, <b>Meissner</b> placed second in her qualifying group and fifth in the short program, putting her in third place overall going into the free skate. During the free skate, <b>Meissner</b> completed seven triple jumps, including two triple-triple combinations, to win the title. This win made her the first woman since Kristi Yamaguchi to win a world title before a national title. <b>Meissner</b> is also {{the first woman to}} win Worlds on her first appearance since Oksana Baiul in 1993. She is the seventh-youngest ladies World Champion in history. <b>Meissner</b> has described this win as changing her career from being the underdog to being expected to win every competition she entered.|$|E
5|$|In the 2002–03 season, <b>Meissner</b> placed {{second at}} her {{regional}} competition and won her sectional competition {{to qualify for}} the 2003 U.S. Championships on the novice level. At age thirteen, <b>Meissner</b> won the U.S. novice national title, after landing a triple lutz jump in her free skate. Following the 2003 U.S. Championships, <b>Meissner</b> was named to the team for the 2003 Triglav Trophy, where she won the bronze medal on the novice level.|$|E
5|$|<b>Meissner</b> was a {{full-time}} student at Fallston High School, a {{public high school}} and graduated from there in May 2007. She entered the University of Delaware as a part-time student in the fall semester of that year. <b>Meissner</b> trained for most of her career in Newark, Delaware at the University of Delaware Figure Skating Club, the club she represents in competition. Until February 2008, <b>Meissner</b> lived in Maryland with her family, and lived at home while attending college. Following her coaching change after the 2008 U.S. Championships, <b>Meissner</b> moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the relationships between the}} density of <b>Meissner's</b> corpuscles and the dermatoglyphic characteristics of human fingers. Dermatoglyphic prints and tissue samples were collected from the index (II) and ring (IV) fingers of 28 cadavers from the Medical School, University of Adelaide. Pattern types, pattern intensity, total ridge count and ridge breadth, were determined for each sample and the density of <b>Meissner's</b> corpuscles established by recording the mean number of <b>Meissner's</b> corpuscles underlying a 10 mm long line on the skin surface. No relationship was found between the density of <b>Meissner's</b> corpuscles and pattern type, pattern intensity or total ridge count. Negative correlations were found for the density of <b>Meissner's</b> corpuscles with both ridge width and size of fingers. Males were found to have significantly larger fingers, larger ridge breadth, and a lower density of <b>Meissner's</b> corpuscles per 10 mm compared with females. However, {{there was no difference between}} the total number of <b>Meissner's</b> corpuscles per finger in males and females. No significant differences were found in either the density of <b>Meissner's</b> corpuscles between antimeres or between the index and ring fingers. These results suggest that for both the left and right hand in males and females, there is a similar number of <b>Meissner's</b> corpuscles for both the index and ring fingers...|$|R
5|$|<b>Meissner</b> was the {{youngest}} athlete on the United States Olympic team. She spent {{the first week of}} the Games training in Courmayeur, moving to Torino proper a few days before the ladies event began. <b>Meissner</b> skated second in the short program and landed a triple lutz-triple toe loop combination to place fifth in that segment of the competition. Skating second-to-last in the final flight of the free skate, <b>Meissner</b> placed sixth in the free skate and overall.|$|E
5|$|Both Callaghan and Eldredge coached <b>Meissner</b> {{during the}} 2008–09 season. She began the {{season at the}} 2008 Skate America, where she placed 7th.

5|$|By {{the time}} Carl <b>Meissner</b> {{published}} his 1856 {{arrangement of the}} genus, there were 58 described Banksia species. <b>Meissner</b> divided Brown's Banksia verae, which had been renamed Eubanksia by Stephan Endlicher in 1847, into four series based on leaf properties. He listed six species and a further four varieties all now sunk into B.marginata in series Salicinae.|$|E

50|$|<b>Meissner's</b> {{arrangement}} remained current until 1870, {{when it was}} {{superseded by}} George Bentham's arrangement as published in Volume V of Flora Australiensis. Bentham abandoned all of <b>Meissner's</b> infrageneric taxa except Brown's D. sect. Aphragma. In 1996, however, Alex George published a revised arrangement, resurrecting Brown's Diplophragma at subgenus rank, and also <b>Meissner's</b> series Marginatae, Acrodontae, Ilicinae, Decurrentes, Runcinatae and Pectinatae.|$|R
5000|$|Taylor et al. (1996) {{reported}} {{the presence of}} Krause end-bulbs and a type of nerve ending called <b>Meissner's</b> corpuscles. Their density is reportedly greater in the ridged band (a region of ridged mucosa {{at the tip of}} the foreskin) than in the larger area of smooth mucosa. They are affected by age: their incidence decreases after adolescence. <b>Meissner's</b> corpuscles could not be identified in all individuals. Bhat et al studied <b>Meissner's</b> corpuscles at a number of different sites, including the [...] "finger tips, palm, front of forearm, sole, lips, prepuce of penis, dorsum of hand and dorsum of foot". They found the lowest <b>Meissner's</b> Index (density) in the foreskin, and also reported that corpuscles at this site were physically smaller. Differences in shape were also noted. They concluded that these characteristics were found in [...] "less sensitive areas of the body". In the late 1950s, Winkelmann suggested that some receptors had been wrongly identified as <b>Meissner's</b> corpuscles.|$|R

50|$|Carl <b>Meissners</b> taxonomic {{arrangement}} of Banksia {{was published in}} 1856, {{as part of his}} chapter on the Proteaceae in A. P. de Candolles Prodromus systematis naturalis regni vegetabilis. It was the first attempt to provide an infrageneric classification for the genus, aside from Robert Browns publication of two subgenera in 1810. <b>Meissners</b> arrangement stood until 1870, when it was superseded by the {{arrangement of}} George Bentham. <b>Meissners</b> arrangement was an excellent survey of the known species at that time, but his infrageneric taxa were all highly heterogeneous.|$|R

5|$|Before the 2008 U.S. Championships, <b>Meissner</b> {{worked on}} her spins with Todd Eldredge. She placed 4th {{in the short}} program and 7th in the free after falling three times.

After Nationals, Eldredge called her with more input on her spins and recommended his long-time coach Richard Callaghan. <b>Meissner</b> made the choice to switch coaches from long-time coach Pam Gregory to a temporary arrangement with Richard Callaghan in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. She trained with Callaghan for the six weeks between Nationals and the 2008 World Championships.|$|E
5|$|From 2003 through 2008, <b>Meissner</b> was {{coached by}} Pam Gregory at the University of Delaware Figure Skating Club. She {{moved up to}} the junior level in the 2003–04 season.

She {{went on to win}} the Junior Grand Prix event in Bled, Slovenia, which {{qualified}} her for the Junior Grand Prix Final, where she placed 5th. At the 2004 U.S. Championships, <b>Meissner</b> was second behind Katy Taylor after the short program, but won the free skate, after landing two triple lutzes, to win the Junior national title. At Nationals, <b>Meissner</b> was named to the U.S. team to the 2004 World Junior Championships, where she landed her first triple lutz-triple toe combination in competition and won the silver medal behind Miki Ando.|$|E
