5|$|Although Centre {{was known}} as one of Kentucky's {{foremost}} colleges, Cooper's father wanted him to broaden his education and, after one year at Centre, Cooper transferred to Yale College in New Haven, Connecticut. At Yale, he was a classmate of his future U.S. Senate colleague, Stuart Symington. Cooper was active in many extracurricular activities at Yale, including the Sophomore German Committee, the Junior Promenade Committee, the Student Council, the Class Day Committee, the Southern Club, the University Club, and Beta Theta Pi. A member of the Undergraduate Athletic Association, he played football and basketball, becoming the first person in Yale history to be named captain of the basketball team in his junior and senior years. In his senior year, he was accepted into the elite Skull and Bones society but regretted not being accepted into Phi Beta Kappa. Upon graduation, he was voted most popular and <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>succeed</b> in his class.|$|E

25|$|When Papagos {{died after}} a brief illness (1955), King Paul of Greece {{appointed}} the 48-year-old Karamanlis as Prime Minister. The King's appointment took the Greek political world by surprise, as it bypassed Stephanos Stephanopoulos and Panagiotis Kanellopoulos, two senior Greek Rally politicians who were widely considered as the heavyweights <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>succeed</b> Papagos. After becoming Prime Minister, Karamanlis reorganized the Greek Rally as the National Radical Union. One of the first bills he promoted as Prime Minister implemented the extension of full voting rights to women, which stood dormant although nominally approved in 1952. Karamanlis won three successive elections (1956, 1958 and 1961).|$|E
25|$|After World War II, {{the family}} moved to Kansas City, Missouri, where the young Hopper {{attended}} Saturday art classes at the Kansas City Art Institute. At the age of 13, Hopper and his family moved to San Diego, where his mother worked as a lifeguard instructor and his father was a post office manager (Hopper has acknowledged, though, that his father was in the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency, in China with Mao Zedong). Hopper was voted <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>succeed</b> at Helix High School, where he was active in the drama club, speech and choir. It was there that he developed an interest in acting, studying at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego, and the Actors Studio in New York City (he studied with Lee Strasberg for five years). Hopper struck up a friendship with actor Vincent Price, whose passion for art influenced Hopper's interest in art. He was especially fond of the plays of William Shakespeare.|$|E

500|$|The small Republican {{majority}} in the Senate made Irreconcilable votes necessary to Lodge's strategy, and he met with Borah in April 1919, persuading him {{to go along with}} the plan of delay and reservations as the <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>succeed,</b> as it would allow the initial popular support for Wilson's proposal to diminish. Neither senator really liked or trusted the other, but they formed a wary pact to defeat the treaty. Lodge was also chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and he delayed the treaty by convening a lengthy series of hearings, presiding over a committee packed with Irreconcilables, including Borah. As these hearings continued in the summer of 1919, Wilson undertook a speaking tour by train to get the public to press the Senate for ratification, a tour that ended in his collapse. [...] In the months that followed, an ailing Wilson refused any compromise.|$|E
500|$|Ferraro {{stayed on}} at Mount Saint Mary's as a boarder for a while, then briefly {{attended}} a parochial {{school in the}} South Bronx. Beginning in 1947, she attended and lived at the parochial Marymount Academy in Tarrytown, New York, using income from a family rental property in Italy and skipping seventh grade. At Marymount Ferraro {{was a member of}} the honor society, active in several clubs and sports, voted <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>succeed,</b> and graduated in 1952. Her mother was adamant that she get a full education, despite an uncle in the family saying, [...] "Why bother? She's pretty. She's a girl. She'll get married." [...] Ferraro attended Marymount Manhattan College with a scholarship while sometimes holding two or three jobs at the same time. During her senior year she began dating John Zaccaro of Forest Hills, Queens, who had graduated from Iona College with a commission in the U.S. Marine Corps. Ferraro received a Bachelor of Arts in English in 1956; she was the first woman in her family to gain a college degree. She also passed the city exam to become a licensed school teacher.|$|E

2500|$|As Headmaster of Choate, George St. John's chapel talks {{included}} a recurring phrase that was widely remembered by Choate alumni. In 2008, school archivist Judy Donald found the phrase in St. John's notebooks, and in 2011 journalist Chris Matthews published the discovery in his biography of JFK. St. John's phrase (borrowed from Harvard dean LeBaron Briggs) was, [...] "The youth who loves {{his alma mater}} will always ask not 'What can she do for me?' but 'What can I do for her?'"

2500|$|TVA was heralded by New Dealers and the New Deal Coalition {{not only}} as a {{successful}} economic development program for a depressed area but also as a democratic nation-building effort overseas because of its alleged grassroots inclusiveness as articulated by director David Lilienthal. The TVA was controversial in the 1930s. Historian Thomas McCraw concludes (1971 p.157) that Roosevelt [...] "rescued the [...] industry from its own abuses" [...] but [...] "he might have done this much with a great deal less agitation and ill will". New Dealers hoped to build numerous other TVAs around the country but were defeated by Wendell Willkie and the Conservative coalition in Congress. The valley authority model did not replace the limited-purpose water programs of the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. State-centered theorists hold that reformers are <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>succeed</b> during periods such as the New Deal era, when they are supported by a democratized polity and when they dominate Congress and the administration.|$|E

This was a breach of protocol, and, as Brezhnev had earlier signed messages to all Soviet-aligned heads of state, the absence of his signature was seen as suspicious. The delay in declaring the death of Brezhnev was seen by some First World commentators as proof of the ongoing power struggle in the Soviet leadership over who would succeed him.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of combining silicon and magnetic bubble technologies is demonstrated. Results of bubble film annealing {{indicate that a}} low temperature silicon on garnet technology is the <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> one <b>to</b> <b>succeed</b> commercially. Annealing ambients are also shown {{to have a major}} effect on the magnetic properties of bubble films. Functional MOSFETs were fabricated on bubble films coated with thick (approximately 1 micron) SiO 2 layers. The two main problems with these silicon on garnet MOSFETs are low electron mobilities and large gate leakage currents. Results indicate that the laser recrystallized silicon and gate oxide (SiO 2) layers are contaminated. The data suggest that part of the contaminating ions originate in the sputtered oxide spacer layer and part originates in the bubble film itself. A diffusion barrier, such as silicon nitride, placed between the bubble film and the silicon layer should eliminate the contamination induced problem...|$|R
2500|$|Blank-faced, often emotionless and coldly efficient, Michael Samuelle is {{a former}} radical student activist whose protest group sparked the Paris Riots of 1984. Not long after being sent to prison, he is {{recruited}} into Section One. He graduates nine months early directly as a level 3 operative. He becomes {{one of their most}} successful and respected operatives. A few years later, however, the apparent death of his wife, Simone—a fellow Section operative whom he married against the wishes of Operations and Madeline, affects him greatly but not enough to grant cancellation. He completely shuts down emotionally, becoming almost an automaton. It is not until Nikita enters the organization that he begins to open up emotionally once again. Simone is revealed to still be alive early in the first season and sacrifices her life to exact revenge on her abductor for her years of imprisonment and torture. This time Michael has Nikita to fall back on. Complicating their often difficult relationship is Michael's [...] "blood cover" [...] marriage to Elena Vacek, the daughter of a fearsome terrorist that Section One has pursued for decades.

Applications in many industries, from medical to aerospace, suffer from formation of microcracks, which often result in catastrophic failure of the product when the cracks remain undetected. A self-healing material capable of microcrack elimination would improve the safety of such products, as well as extend their lifetime. This paper presents several recently developed autonomous self-healing designs of polymer composites. The commercialization potential of the designs is explored. Potential applications in four industries are identified, and the helicopter blade is selected as the <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> application <b>to</b> <b>succeed</b> in introducing the novel material into the market.

40|$|Filming {{chemical}} reactions or atoms in motion {{is one of}} the greatest scientific dreams yet to be accomplished which requires sub-atomic spatiotemporal resolution. Newly emerging X-ray free electron lasers and laser-based attoscience centers are the <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> candidates <b>to</b> <b>succeed</b> first thanks <b>to</b> their angstrom-level radiation. To provide the necessary temporal resolution, these facilities must be able to synchronize numerous mode-locked lasers with ultra-high precision across kilometer-distances. Here, we report a synchronous mode-locked laser network incorporating two remote slave lasers at different central wavelengths and repetition rates over 4. 7 -km distance. The network exhibits a record-low timing drift of 0. 6 fs RMS below 1 Hz over 40 h reaching the 20 $^{th}$ decimal uncertainty in ~ 8000 -s averaging time. Short-term stability measurements show an out-of-loop timing jitter of only 1. 3 fs RMS integrated from 1 Hz to 1 MHz. We also present a comprehensive noise analysis of the network considering both quantum noise and technical noise sources. For the first time in literature, we reveal the standard quantum limit for the timing jitter acquired by optical pulses when traveling in fiber links. Our comprehensive feedback loop analysis reveals nine technical noise sources out of which the slave lasers inherent jitter dominates with 1. 26 fs RMS. This suggests that timing precision of the network is not limited by our synchronization scheme and could be improved even further by developing lower noise mode-locked lasers.
