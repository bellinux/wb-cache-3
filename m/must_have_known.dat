5|$|Numerous {{appeals for}} Hess's release were {{launched}} by his lawyer, Dr Alfred Seidl, beginning {{as early as}} 1947. These were denied, mainly because the Soviets repeatedly vetoed the proposal. Spandau was located in West Berlin, and its existence gave the Soviets a foothold in that sector of the city. Additionally, Soviet officials believed Hess <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> in 1941 that an attack on their country was imminent. In 1967 Wolf Rüdiger Hess began a campaign to win his father's release, garnering support from notable politicians such as Geoffrey Lawrence, 1st Baron Oaksey in Britain and Willy Brandt in Germany, but to no avail, {{in spite of the}} prisoner's advanced age and deteriorating health.|$|E
5|$|Halperin {{cautioned that}} Austen often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters, {{and some of}} the {{statements}} about Lefroy may have been ironic. However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him. The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical, as both Lefroy and Austen <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>known.</b> Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane Austen never saw him again. In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.|$|E
5|$|Realizing Arganan <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> of this, Zael refuses his knighthood {{and sets}} out with Calista to destroy Lazulis' cannon, which {{is powered by}} Lazulis' half of the Outsider. However, when the Gurak attack Lazulis they decide to instead help Arganan use the cannon to drive off the attack. The cannon's fire proves insufficient, and Arganan is mysteriously killed by its power. The Gurak overrun Lazulis. Calista and the mercenaries head out to {{retrieve}} Zangurak's half of the Outsider, only to find its power has already been taken. Once they remove it, the Gurak fortress starts to crumble, knocking Zael and Calista into the ocean. They are rescued by Gurak ships. On board is Jirall, who {{has been given a}} cursed sword by Zangurak for him to kill Zael. Realizing the sword is affecting Jirall's mind, Zael tries to save Jirall by disarming him, but the cursed sword moves unaided and kills Jirall. Meanwhile, the Gurak take Calista to Zangurak.|$|E

5|$|When Kurt Waldheim {{was named}} {{secretary-general}} of the United Nations in 1971, Wiesenthal reported—without checking very thoroughly—that {{there was no evidence}} that he had a Nazi past. This analysis had been supported by the opinions of the American Counterintelligence Corps and Office of Strategic Services when they examined his records right after the war. However, Waldheim's 1985 autobiography did not include his war service following his recuperation from a 1941 injury. When he returned to active duty in 1942, he was posted to Yugoslavia and Greece, and had knowledge of murders of civilians that took place in those locations during his service there. The Austrian news magazine Profil published a story in March 1986—during his campaign for the presidency of Austria—that Waldheim had been a member of the Sturmabteilung (SA). The New York Times soon reported that Waldheim had failed to reveal all of the facts about his war service. Wiesenthal, embarrassed, attempted to help Waldheim defend himself. The World Jewish Congress investigated the issue, but the Israeli attorney general concluded that their material was insufficient evidence for a conviction. Waldheim was elected president in July 1986. A panel of historians tasked with investigating the case issued a report eighteen months later. They concluded that, while {{there was no evidence that}} Waldheim had committed atrocities, he <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> they were occurring, yet did nothing. Wiesenthal unsuccessfully demanded that Waldheim resign. The World Jewish Congress successfully lobbied to have Waldheim barred from entering the United States.|$|E

25|$|In view of {{the ongoing}} {{international}} controversy, the Austrian government decided to appoint an international committee of historians to examine Waldheim's life between 1938 and 1945.

25|$|An {{advantage}} of this method {{is that it is}} fast (5–20 minutes per sample); a disadvantage is that the solute's chemical structure must be known beforehand.

25|$|In {{a famous}} fragment, Empedocles {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} phenomena of respiration {{by means of an}} elaborate analogy with the clepsydra, an ancient device for conveying liquids from one vessel to another. This fragment has sometimes been connected to a passage in Aristotle's Physics where Aristotle refers to people who twisted wineskins and captured air in clepsydras to demonstrate that void does not exist. There is however, no evidence that Empedocles performed any experiment with clepsydras. The fragment certainly implies that Empedocles knew about the corporeality of air, but he says nothing whatever about the void. The clepsydra was a common utensil and everyone who used it <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>known,</b> in some sense, that the invisible air could resist liquid.|$|E
25|$|Bellange's widow is {{recorded}} as owning 22 of his etched plates in 1619; probably these included the 18 that were later re-issued by the Parisian publisher Jean Le Blond, who added {{his name to}} the plate. This suggests that in his lifetime, Bellange supervised the printing of impressions himself; from at least 1615 there was a printing press for intaglio copperplates (a different piece of equipment to a book press) in Nancy. Distribution of prints through a network of dealers across Europe was already becoming rather efficient. Matthias Merian, whom Bellange <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> from his visit in 1610/11, produced 11 pirate copies of Bellange prints for a publisher in Strasbourg, probably as early as 1615—a standard sign of a successful print in those days. An impression of Bellange's Pieta records that it was bought by John Evelyn in Rome in 1645, and Cassiano dal Pozzo had bought several Bellange prints there, and copies, by the 1650s.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} book, Hipparchus {{assumes that the}} {{parallax}} of the Sun is 0, {{as if it is}} at infinite distance. He then analyzed a solar eclipse, which Toomer (against the opinion of over a century of astronomers) presumes to be the eclipse of 14 March 190. It was total in the region of the Hellespont (and in his birthplace, Nicaea); at the time Toomer proposes the Romans were preparing for war with Antiochus III in the area, and the eclipse is mentioned by Livy in his Ab Urbe Condita Libri VIII.2. It was also observed in Alexandria, where the Sun was reported to be obscured 4/5ths by the Moon. Alexandria and Nicaea are on the same meridian. Alexandria is at about 31° North, and the region of the Hellespont about 40° North. (It has been contended that authors like Strabo and Ptolemy had fairly decent values for these geographical positions, so Hipparchus <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> them too. However, Strabo's Hipparchus dependent latitudes for this region are at least 1° too high, and Ptolemy appears to copy them, placing Byzantium 2° high in latitude.) Hipparchus could draw a triangle formed by the two places and the Moon, and from simple geometry was able to establish a distance of the Moon, expressed in Earth radii. Because the eclipse occurred in the morning, the Moon was not in the meridian, and it has been proposed that as a consequence the distance found by Hipparchus was a lower limit. In any case, according to Pappus, Hipparchus found that the least distance is 71 (from this eclipse), and the greatest 81 Earth radii.|$|E
