500|$|In 1563, Elizabeth told an {{imperial}} envoy: [...] "If I follow the inclination of <b>my</b> <b>nature,</b> it is this: beggar-woman and single, far rather than queen and married". Later in the year, following Elizabeth's illness with smallpox, the succession question became a heated issue in Parliament. They urged the queen to marry or nominate an heir, {{to prevent a}} civil war upon her death. She refused to do either. In April she prorogued the Parliament, which did not reconvene until she needed its support to raise taxes in 1566. Having promised to marry previously, she told an unruly House: ...|$|E

[...] Six years ago I left the Catholic church, hating it most fervently. I found it {{impossible for me to}} remain in it on account of the impulses of <b>my</b> <b>nature.</b> I made secret war upon it when I was a student and declined to accept the positions it offered me. By doing this I made myself a beggar but I retained my pride. Now I make open war upon it by what I write and say and do.|$|E

500|$|Achebe's {{criticism}} {{has become a}} mainstream perspective on Conrad's work. The essay {{was included in the}} 1988 Norton critical edition of Conrad's novel. Editor Robert Kimbrough called it one of [...] "the three most important events in Heart of Darkness criticism since the second edition of his book..." [...] Critic Nicolas Tredell divides Conrad criticism [...] "into two epochal phases: before and after Achebe." [...] Asked frequently about his essay, Achebe once explained that he never meant for the work to be abandoned: [...] "It's not in <b>my</b> <b>nature</b> to talk about banning books. I am saying, read it– with the kind of understanding and with the knowledge I talk about. And read it beside African works." [...] Interviewed on National Public Radio with Robert Siegel, in October 2009, Achebe remains consistent, although tempering this criticism in a discussion entitled [...] "'Heart of Darkness' is inappropriate": [...] "Conrad was a seductive writer. He could pull his reader into the fray. And {{if it were not for}} what he said about me and my people, I would probably be thinking only of that seduction." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{spoliation}} of Bavaria led to entreaties {{from the}} Elector's wife, Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska, {{for him to}} divest himself of the French alliance. Although the Elector wavered somewhat in his allegiance to Louis XIV, his resolve to continue fighting against Leopold I and the Grand Alliance was stiffened when news arrived that Tallard's reinforcements– some 35,000 men– would soon be in Bavaria. Marlborough now intensified the policy of devastating the Elector's territory. On 16 July the Duke wrote to his friend Heinsius, the Grand Pensionary of Holland, [...] "We are advancing {{into the heart of}} Bavaria to destroy the country and oblige the Elector {{one way or the other}} to a compliance". The policy compelled the Elector to send 8,000 troops from Augsburg to defend his own property, reserving only a fraction of his army to join the French under Marsin and Tallard. But although Marlborough thought it a necessary strategy to secure success, it was of doubtful morality. The Duke himself confessed his reservations to his wife, Sarah, [...] "This is so uneasy to <b>my</b> <b>nature</b> that nothing but an absolute necessity would have obliged me to consent to it. For these poor people suffer only for their master's ambition." [...] Accounts differ as to the actual amounts of damage done. De La Colonie thought that reports of the devastation were perhaps exaggerated for propaganda purposes; yet Christian Davies serving with Hay's Dragoons wrote, [...] "The allies sent parties on every hand to ravage the country... We spared nothing, killing, burning or otherwise destroying whatever we could not carry off." [...] To Historian David Chandler, Marlborough must bear the full responsibility for the destruction, for although he undoubtedly found it hard to stomach it was taken under Baden's, and the Emperor's protests.|$|E

[...] He added, [...] "...Fate dealt us this card, and I don't think we've done particularly badly with it. Music today seems so very worthy, so very dull. Nobody wants to stick their neck out any more, and I think that is a great pity. We did, and we left our mark." ...|$|E

50|$|It is {{generally}} held that Marx's {{view was that}} productive activity is an essential human activity, and can be rewarding when pursued freely. Marx's use of the words 'work' and 'labour' in the section above may be unequivocally negative; {{but this was not}} always the case, and is most strongly found in his early writing. However, Marx was always clear that under capitalism, labour was something inhuman, and dehumanising. 'labour is external to the worker - i.e., does not belong to his essential being; that he, therefore, does not confirm himself in his work, but denies himself, feels miserable and not happy, does not develop free mental and physical energy, but mortifies his flesh and ruins his mind'. While under communism, 'In the individual expression of my life I would have directly created your expression of your life, and therefore in my individual activity I would have directly confirmed and realised <b>my</b> true <b>nature,</b> <b>my</b> human <b>nature,</b> <b>my</b> communal nature'.|$|R
2500|$|In 1989, Haggard {{recorded}} a song, [...] "Me and Crippled Soldiers Give a Damn," [...] {{in response to}} the Supreme Court's decision not to allow banning flag burning, considering it to be [...] "speech" [...] and therefore protected under the First Amendment. After CBS Records Nashville avoided releasing the song, Haggard bought {{his way out of the}} contract and signed with Curb Records, which was willing to release the song. Haggard commented about the situation, [...] "I've never been a guy that can do what people told me.... It's always been <b>my</b> <b>nature</b> to fight the system." ...|$|E
2500|$|If, however [...] "dyed" [...] (defined as to tinge with color, (OED 1) as of {{textiles}} and clothing) {{as the key}} metaphor, then the concepts, values and motivations behind the English sumptuary laws become of plausible relevance. [...] Indeed, a more direct reference to the dyer's profession is given in Sonnet 111, [...] "And almost thence <b>my</b> <b>nature</b> is subdued / to what it works in, like the dyer's hand" [...] Here in Sonnet 101 as in others in the sequence Shakespeare {{can be seen as}} making reference to the [...] "anxiety about the emulation of betters" [...] that drove the regulation of apparel and its coloring.|$|E
2500|$|I {{realize that}} I shouldn't be {{surprised}} at God's doing things that I can't explain. [...] I shouldn't doubt His existence just because I find that I sometimes can't understand why or how He has made something. [...] I know that <b>my</b> <b>nature</b> is weak and limited and that God's is limitless, incomprehensible, and infinite, and, from this, I can infer that He can do innumerable things whose reasons are unknown to me. [...] On this ground alone, I regard the common practice of explaining things {{in terms of their}} purposes to be useless in physics: it would be foolhardy of me to think that I can discover God's purposes.

2500|$|From January 2002, until {{sometime}} in 2005, Geldof listened very closely to Father's Rights campaigners, {{and it was}} reported that he had sacks of mail arriving at his door on a daily basis from fathers who were unhappy with the British family courts. [...] He said, [...] "I am heartbroken. I just cannot believe what happens to people, what is done to them {{in the name of the}} law. You only have to open your eyes to see what I call the 'Sad Dads on Sundays Syndrome'". [...] He has also called for The Children Act to be repealed and his latest statement to Father's Rights campaigners was, [...] "It's not in <b>my</b> <b>nature</b> to shut up".|$|E
2500|$|Gordon {{decided to}} stay and hold Khartoum despite the orders of the Gladstone {{government}} to merely report about the best means of supervising the evacuation of the Sudan. Powers who acted as Gordon's unofficial press attaché wrote in The Times: [...] "We are daily expecting British troops. We cannot bring ourselves {{to believe that we}} are to be abandoned". In his diary, Gordon wrote: [...] "I own to having been very insubordinate to Her Majesty's Government and its officials, but it is <b>my</b> <b>nature,</b> and I cannot help it. I fear I have not even tried to play battledore and shuttlecock with them. I know if I was chief I would never employ myself for I am incorrigible".|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the ideas}} of Henry James Sr. were {{received}} by his contemporaries with little enthusiasm (see below) and although he was altogether out of sympathy with his age's enthusiasm for science, he never grew discouraged; in fact, {{some of the best}} expositions of his thought {{are to be found in}} the volumes of his later years. [...] He participated actively in the lives of his children, whose education he had done so much to shape. [...] His society was cultivated by many, who enjoyed his conversation—provided that they were strong enough to bear the sometimes devastating criticism he offered. [...] He delighted in paradox and exaggeration and enjoyed flouting convention. [...] But he shunned formal society, which he found uncongenial. [...] He wrote: [...] "The bent of <b>my</b> <b>nature</b> is towards affection and thought rather than action. [...] I love the fireside rather than the forum." ...|$|E

The Weeknd previewed the album at a listening party in New York City on 24 October. It was his first major media event. According to music magazine NMEs website, in {{an open letter to}} his fans The Weeknd posted on his website in regards to the [...] "Rolling Stone" [...] video, [...] "Because I am a man of few words, I chose to make a viral video to show you how I felt and where I stand. I usually don't like to 'spoon feed' my audience because I grew up idolising story tellers who tell stories using symbolism, so it was in <b>my</b> <b>nature</b> to do the same. The [...] "Rolling Stone" [...] video takes place in a dimly lit studio which represents the two worlds I have been stuck in. The gloomy side represents the mainstream world while the other side represents the underground. The girl holding on represents you." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1921, he {{appeared}} again in opera as Don José in Carmen and as Lohengrin for Carl Rosa at Covent Garden, but thereafter devoted {{most of his}} efforts to concert performance. In 1921 he sang Gerontius at the memorial meeting for Gervase Elwes at the Royal Albert Hall with the Royal Choral Society. (He sang wonderfully, according to the Sunday Times, a courageous thing to do since {{in his own words}} he found the sudden death of Elwes in a train accident 'too shocking, too staggering to contemplate. It has affected me to the very depths of <b>my</b> <b>nature</b> ... it brought me to my knees.') From 1920 he began to specialise in song-recitals, of which he gave several each year, favouring all-English performances and championing English composers, but drawing from the repertoire of German and French songs also. In 1922 Roger Quilter, who had written much for Elwes and worked closely with him, dedicated his 'Morning song' (Thomas Heywood) to Coates, one of his most vibrant and characteristic miniatures, though Coates did not give the first performance of it.|$|E
2500|$|The use of {{the term}} [...] "loving {{offenders}}" [...] in line 5 can have two meanings: that the offenders (the fair youth and the mistress) are in love; but it can also mean that they seem to enjoy their offense. This line, along with line 12, [...] "And both for my sake lay on me this cross," [...] hearken back to Sonnet 34, in which the speaker declares, [...] "The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief / To him that bears the strong offence's cross." [...] The biblical allusion of the cross ties the poet himself to Jesus in his suffering so that others might be happy, relieved of their sins. Hammond writes that he feels the author was projecting himself as a martyr, a Christ like figure bearing the cross. Hammond reads line 5, [...] "loving offenders" [...] to mean equally as a vocative or self description; saying, 'it is <b>my</b> <b>nature</b> to love those who offend against me'. [...] It appears that most critics agree that the author himself is accepting the 'cross' in this poem.|$|E

2500|$|To {{prepare for}} the role, De Niro {{consulted}} with Pileggi, who had research material that had been discarded while writing the book. De Niro often called Hill {{several times a day}} to ask how Burke walked, held his cigarette, and so on. Driving to and from the set, Liotta listened to FBI audio cassette tapes of Hill, so he could practice speaking like his real-life counterpart. To research her role, Lorraine Bracco tried to get close to a mob wife but was unable to, because they exist in a very tight-knit community. She decided not to meet the real Karen, saying she [...] "thought {{it would be better if}} the creation came from me. I used her life with her parents as an emotional guideline for the role". Paul Sorvino had no problem finding the voice and walk of his character, but found it challenging finding what he called [...] "that kernel of coldness and absolute hardness that is antithetical to <b>my</b> <b>nature</b> except when my family is threatened".|$|E
2500|$|Genco Russo's once {{described}} {{his role in}} the community to the social activist Danilo Dolci. It provides an illustration of the self-image of the mafioso in the second, [...] "legitimate" [...] stage of his career - the mafioso as a public benefactor rather than as a dangerous criminal: [...] "It's in <b>my</b> <b>nature.</b> I have no ulterior motives. If I can do a man a favour, no matter who he is, I will; because that's how I'm made... I can't say 'no' to anyone. The trouble I'm put to is not so great that I have to refuse people in need... Very often warm-heartedness will win a man gratitude and friendship, and then the time comes to ask for one thing or another in... Folks come and ask how they should vote because they feel the need for advice. They want to show that they are grateful to those who have worked for their good; they want to thank them for what they've done by voting for them; but they are ignorant, and want to be told how to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nadal's {{withdrawal}} {{elevated the}} first alternate, Gilles Simon, into the draw, {{making him the}} second Frenchman of the eight-men field, alongside Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, and marking {{the first time that}} two Frenchmen participated in the year-end event since the Masters Grand Prix event of 1986, in which Yannick Noah and Henri Leconte competed. Simon was ranked eighth in the ATP Race entering the Paris Masters thanks to his final in Madrid and his semifinal at the Grand Prix de Tennis de Lyon, where he lost to eventual champion Robin Söderling, but was knocked out of the Top Eight when he lost to Andy Roddick in the third round, and Tsonga qualified by winning the title. Simon, who flew to Shanghai with countryman and friend Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on November 5, commented on Nadal's withdrawal and his first selection for the year-end event: [...] "I was unhappy that he had to pull out. I would really have preferred to qualify directly by finishing eighth. It's not in <b>my</b> <b>nature</b> to wish that another player can't play.
