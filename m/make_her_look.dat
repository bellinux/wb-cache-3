5|$|Sakura {{has become}} the series' female lead, although, she was not {{immediately}} intended for the role. Kishimoto has had difficulty drawing her character resulting in Kishimoto inadvertently emphasizing certain parts of her appearance, including her large forehead. In {{order to make the}} character more appealing {{in the second part of}} the series, Kishimoto designed her costume to <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> more like a martial artist as well as more beautiful during later chapters. Chie Nakamura voices the character in the animated adaptations of the series, while Kate Higgins plays her in the English dub.|$|E
5|$|Jimsy Augustine, a young college student, goes to Bhavana Studio. She tells Mahesh {{that she}} wants to {{participate}} in Vanitha cover competition and asks him to <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> as good as possible. Perplexed at the unusual request, Mahesh conducts the photo shoot. Jimsy's photograph turns out to be dull and unimpressive, and her irritation makes Mahesh question his skill as a photographer. Upset, he turns to his father for advice. Vincent explains photography as an art to his son. Mahesh goes through his father's photograph collection, finally understanding their angles and lighting, and gets an idea.|$|E
5|$|Nomura {{worked on}} the {{character}} designs for the main cast. He was originally only {{going to work on}} Aya and Eve, but after seeing the settings for the other characters, he offered to design them too. The team wanted to emphasize the character's sexuality. As part of this, the team included a scene where Aya takes a shower. This was inspired by a similar scene in Parasite Eve II. When the title was being developed for PSP, the team's main challenge with the character was to <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> as realistic as possible while retaining her established physical traits. Using this new realism, the team wanted to portray the fear felt by humans when faced with such threats through Aya. Achieving this realism proved {{one of the most difficult}} aspects of development. Her alternate costumes were not a high priority for the team, so their artists had high creative freedom.|$|E
5000|$|Cosmopolitan {{magazine}} {{cited the}} dress {{as one of}} the best Oscar dresses of all time, saying, [...] "Coupled with the bright red lips and wispy hair, Michelle's saffron Vera Wang dress <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> like she's straight out of an old Hollywood film. The cut <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> body <b>look</b> amazing, especially considering that she had given birth to Matilda just three months before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{you notice}} what a {{brilliant}} kind of pink it was?" [...] Valentin inquired, {{by way of}} answer. [...] "It <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> as white as new milk." ...|$|R
50|$|As Stephanie {{attempts}} to resume {{her relationship with}} Morelli, they are constantly interrupted - first by criminals, then by Stephanie's accidental dye job that <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> like Ronald McDonald.|$|R
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Joel and Ellie {{was the central}} focus of the game; all other elements were developed around it. Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson were cast as Joel and Ellie, respectively, and provided voice and motion capture performances. Baker and Johnson contributed {{to the development of}} the characters; for example, Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness, and Johnson convinced Druckmann that Ellie should be stronger and more defensive. Ellie's physical appearance was also redesigned throughout development to <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> more similar to Johnson. The game's other characters also underwent changes. The character Tess was originally intended to be the main antagonist of The Last of Us, but the team found it difficult to believe her motives. The sexuality of the character Bill was originally left vague in the script, but later altered to further reflect his homosexuality.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{creative}} team {{did not want}} the X-Men to have an all-male lineup, editor Roy Thomas suggested that Cockrum make his character Typhoon, originally designed as a male, into the woman of the group. Cockrum liked the idea, and outfitted Typhoon with The Black Cat's costume, a cape, and a new haircut with white hair. His collaborators feared that Storm’s white hair would <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> like a grandmother, but Cockrum, confident that he could consistently draw the character so that she would appear young, insisted on this aspect of her appearance.|$|E
25|$|Sachsen {{was later}} renamed Hermann. On 22 August 1942 she sailed from Tromsø to operate off {{the east coast}} of Greenland, {{arriving}} at Shannon Island on 27 August. The ship was disguised in an attempt to <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> like sea ice. In the spring of 1943, the Germans were discovered by the Slædepatruljen Sirius, but they later managed to capture its leader, and ordered him to help them find a new site for a weather station. He took Kapitän Ritter to Scoresbysund, where Ritter was captured by the Allies and made a prisoner of war. Hermann was scuttled on 17 June 1943 in Hansa Bay. Her crew were evacuated by a Dornier Do 26 flying boat.|$|E

5000|$|Zhora's {{gunshot wounds}} are both on her {{shoulder}} blades. The end result <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> like an angel whose wings have been cut off. Zhora makes use of a serpent that [...] "once corrupted man" [...] in her performance.|$|R
25|$|Donna, whom Kathy still {{refuses to}} accept, sinks into {{depression}} and overdoses on heroin and dies, leaving Kathy wrestling with guilt. Kathy attempts {{to move on}} and begins a relationship with market trader Laurie Bates (Gary Powell). Their relationship manages to survive the interference of Julie Cooper (Louise Plowright), who tries but fails to claim Laurie for herself. However, when Laurie begins buying Kathy extravagant clothing and jewellery, she questions his motives, thinking he's trying to <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> like his late wife, and loses interest. Laurie takes her rejection badly and some tactless comments regarding her sexual abstinence makes Kathy believe he has deceived her of his true nature. She ends the relationship. Later in the year, Kathy begins dating Eddie Royle (Michael Melia). He patiently pursues her, but after a few dates, she becomes hesitant and after she sees him kissing Eibhlin O'Donnell (Mary Conlon) - his former girlfriend visiting from Ireland - their lukewarm romance ends.|$|E
25|$|Problematic and strong-willed, {{she falls}} for the Butchers' lodger Paul Priestly (Mark Thrippleton) in 1989, much to Frank's annoyance. Diane takes the {{relationship}} {{more seriously than}} Paul, and she is devastated when he finishes with her to begin a fling with hairdreser Julie Cooper (Louise Plowright). Paul and Julie do not last, and he immediately returns to Diane. Scorned, Diane cannot forgive Julie for taking Paul, and she plays various vengeful tricks on her as payback, such as sabotaging her salon's opening day and sending her a male escort to <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> desperate. Julie responds by flirting with Paul to infuriate Diane further, and their feud culminates in a showdown in The Queen Vic one night, at which Julie humiliates Diane. Paul quickly loses interest in Diane. Ignoring his reticence, Diane convinces herself that Paul is contemplating proposing marriage to her, so she is broken-hearted when he returns to his hometown in Leeds in December 1989; he leaves without saying goodbye.|$|E
500|$|She {{followed}} her roles in Lenzi's films with {{a leading role}} in Corrado Farina's [...] Baba Yaga (1973) as the titular witch, alongside Isabelle De Funès and George Eastman. TV Guide referred to the film as an [...] "exceptionally handsome example of 1970s Italian pop-exploitation filmmaking sweetened by Piero Umilani's lounge-jazz score," [...] and praised Baker's performance, but noted that she was [...] "physically wrong for the role; her elaborate lace-and-beribboned costumes sometimes <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> more like a fleshy Miss Havisham than a sleekly predatory sorceress".|$|E
50|$|Everybody {{gets ready}} for the Founder's Day parade and dressed up in period outfits, {{including}} Elena (Nina Dobrev), something that <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> like Katherine even more. Damon (Ian Somerhalder) tells Stefan (Paul Wesley) {{that he does not}} need to worry since he will not steal his girlfriend.|$|R
60|$|SECOND ALDERMAN. Nay, no man need; {{but did you}} mark our Queen? The colour freely play'd {{into her}} face, And the half sight which <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> so stern, Seem'd thro' that dim dilated world of hers, To read our faces; I have never seen her So queenly or so goodly.|$|R
50|$|Fellow {{part-timer}} at {{the same}} pizza place that Tadakuni works for, she has a complex for <b>her</b> <b>looks.</b> When she takes off her glasses and opens her eyes wide, her reflection from a convex mirror <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> like a completely different person. She goes to the same school as Yanagin and holds the position of number one grade-wise, while Yanagin is number two.|$|R
500|$|Despite {{a warning}} from Team Ninja {{that no more}} DOA games would be {{released}} for the PC if the modding community released DOA5 mods that are not designed for [...] "good and moral" [...] play, nude models of Ayane were quickly created {{by members of the}} forum Lustful Illumination. Ayane was featured through Monty Oum's computer-animated fan series Dead Fantasy from the start. A fan mod also brought Ayane to Ultra Street Fighter IV, mapping her over Ibuki, and another removes Ayane's makeup in DOA5 to <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> more like she did in DOA2.|$|E
500|$|Aboard the ship, Yates {{gave the}} {{characters}} their own distinct looks. Theron {{is dressed in}} an ice-silver, silk mohair suit. Yates said, [...] " [...] is the ice queen. It was always our vision to <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> as sculptural as possible". Fassbender's David is dressed similarly to other crew members, but his outfit was given finer lines to produce a more linear appearance. To create a casual, relaxed appearance, Marshall-Green's Holloway was dressed in hoodies, fisherman pants, and flip-flops, while Elba wore a canvas-greased jacket to represent his long career {{at the helm of}} a ship.|$|E
500|$|The team {{aimed for}} Marlene's {{physical}} design to <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> [...] "capable and in control", while conveying compassion, {{to result in}} players believing that she does care for Ellie. Dandridge found the character of Marlene to be complex, believing that she [...] "wants {{to do the best}} thing for the greater good", but events in her life have resulted in a confused moral standing. Though she personally believed that Marlene is a fundamentally [...] "good" [...] person, Dandridge felt that the ambiguous morality of the characters is a significant contributor to the interest in their humanity. Dandridge also appreciated the use of motion capture, comparing it to theater productions.|$|E
6000|$|... "Right oh!" [...] {{the young}} lady {{declared}} cheerfully. [...] "Now you go and prink up for dinner. We're ready, Flossie and I. The little Jew girl's got a new dress--black covered with sequins. It <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> yellower than ever. There goes the bell, and we're both as hungry as hunters. Look sharp!" ...|$|R
50|$|New {{characters}} include Tremaine Gidigbi and Liberty Baker, who marry in episode 5 in {{a typically}} over-the-top Egyptian-themed wedding. Liberty, a top supermodel with {{a striking resemblance}} to Naomi Campbell, is exposed by the press for having a lesbian affair with her P.A. Urszula Rosen, then stars in a Japanese advert that <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> like a cannibal.|$|R
5000|$|On Whiley's {{presenting}} style, Times columnist Caitlin Moran {{has stated}} [...] "her on-screen style {{that seems to}} inspire the main rage - a decades-long, squirming awkwardness that <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> as if she's about to corkscrew right off her chair and start drilling into the ground. This awkwardness extends into her conversational rhythm, which is angular - possibly free-jazz in origin." ...|$|R
500|$|Discussing Emma's {{style and}} costuming, Glee costume {{designer}} Lou Eyrich has explained: [...] "We wanted to <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> like everything’s so neat—perfectly ironed and tucked-in shirts with matching belts, shoes and pins. We {{wanted to make}} her {{stand out from the}} other teachers. She’s always so happy and excited, so we wanted her outfits to represent that sunny disposition. In the pilot, we made her look much more teacher-y. Now we're having more fun with her character, keeping her bright and unusual. Quirky is the word. Emma’s also always in stacked Mary Janes or T-strap heels. It takes the outfit down from being too stylish or too sexy. It makes her look prim and almost old-fashioned." ...|$|E
500|$|Lisa {{finds out}} {{on the last day}} of school how unpopular she is when nobody signs her yearbook. Meanwhile, Ned Flanders offers the Simpson family the use of his beach house over the summer. Marge likes the idea and {{suggests}} that Bart should bring Milhouse and that Lisa should bring a friend too. However, Lisa has no friends to bring and decides to change her image as a result. After reaching the beach house, Lisa tells Marge that she forgot to pack, so they go shopping for new clothes. Lisa buys a new set of clothes that she believes will <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> [...] "cool", and goes to look for some cool children.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} team {{felt that}} establishing Ellie's physical appearance was [...] "critical". They {{felt that she}} needed to appear young enough to make her relationship with Joel—who is in his 40s—believable, but old enough to be credible as a resourceful teenager capable of surviving. A redesign of Ellie's physical appearance was publicized in May 2012; Druckmann stated that the change was to <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> more like Johnson. Prior to the redesign, comparisons were made between Ellie and actress Ellen Page; in June 2013, Page accused Naughty Dog of [...] "ripping off [...] likeness". The team felt that Ellie was important for the game's marketing; Druckmann said that, when asked to move the image of Ellie {{from the front of the}} game's packaging to the back, [...] "everyone at Naughty Dog just flat-out refused".|$|E
50|$|Their {{first trip}} {{together}} is to Earth, where Destrii wears a holographic disguise that <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> human. Together, they foil an invasion by the Cybermen (The Flood, DWM #346-#353). That {{turned out to}} be the last regular Eighth Doctor comic strip story in DWM, and the story ends with Destrii and the Doctor walking off into the sunset to as-yet unrevealed further adventures.|$|R
50|$|Rui En's first {{role as an}} auntie. She puts on 4 kg {{just for}} this role to <b>make</b> <b>her</b> role <b>looked</b> more realistic.|$|R

500|$|Distancing {{the film}} from what {{producer}} Preston Stutzman called the [...] "candy-coated, brightly colored pastel world" [...] of other CG animated films, an {{attempt was made}} to bring an organic look to the film, and dirt was rubbed into the colors. The Nightmare Before Christmas was cited as an inspiration for the filmmakers to try to bend the characters' shapes into extremes, and many other choices unconventional to computer-animated films were also made. For example, one of the Woodsman's eyes was made bigger than the other, and Red was given only four fingers, so as to <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> more like a doll. Producer Katie Hooten explained that [...] "CG in the past has been pushing the envelope to make things look more realistic, but Hoodwinked takes things back to where CG looks a lot more like a cartoon." ...|$|E
500|$|Akihiko Yoshida {{has stated}} that Ashe's {{physical}} features were designed {{with the intent of}} making her look vaguely French, stating that [...] "the base of her bone structure is a French person's. We were given orders from the start to not <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> like an Asian. But we modified her a bit to look more like a Japanese {{for the sake of the}} Japanese audience, and also since a character that looks completely French makes some of the CG expressions difficult." [...] Ashe was voiced by Kari Wahlgren in English and by Mie Sonozaki in Japanese. Despite having been created for Final Fantasy XII, she was first introduced in the 2004 crossover board game Itadaki Street Special. She also appears in Itadaki Street Portable, and was set to appear in Fortress, as revealed in concept art for the game.|$|E
500|$|At the pageant's registration, Lisa meets a {{formidable}} competitor named Amber Dempsey, a blonde girl who cheated by using eyelash implants from Paraguay to <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> cuter. In {{preparation for the}} pageant Lisa receives makeovers at the beauty parlor, training from her brother Bart, and encouragement from her family. The day of the pageant arrives, and on-stage Lisa explains her aim to make Springfield a better place, while Amber wins the crowd's adoration by batting her large eyelashes. Lisa's talent is a jazzy medley of [...] "America the Beautiful" [...] and [...] "Proud Mary". After Krusty the Clown's interview segment, Lisa is announced as the runner-up and Amber the winner. At Amber's first official appearance, a thunderstorm creates a lightning bolt which strikes her metal scepter. She is hospitalized for her injuries, and Lisa is crowned Little Miss Springfield.|$|E

Archaeology is her passion and she's beyond thrilled {{to be part of}} this dig. She wants to find the mummy, but doesn't know exactly what she should be doing. She's also in awe of Abdullah, but petrified of displeasing him. Her desire for {{leadership}} and clear inexperience <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> suspicious.|$|R
50|$|In modern reprints, George {{still wants}} to be a boy, but the {{statement}} that <b>her</b> short hair <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> like a boy has been removed as it is now considered offensive to assume that girls need long hair to be considered feminine. Anne's statement that boys cannot wear pretty dresses or like girl's dolls has been taken out. Julian and Dick now help the girls with cleaning the house and washing dishes.|$|R
5000|$|This low-budget {{production}} {{opened to}} mixed reviews, with a critic from Indolink.com claiming [...] "even though {{the film has}} absolutely nothing new to offer, it doesn’t test your patience." [...] The Deccan Herald labelled that [...] "all in all it is a pleasant film" [...] and that [...] "Vijay’s a little glib, Rambha’s weight loss <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> <b>look</b> haggard and Raghuvaran as not a villain is nice", claiming it was [...] "worth a look".|$|R
