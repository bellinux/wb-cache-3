50|$|Modern Texas Instruments calculators {{such as the}} TI-89 series use {{function}} keys to open drop-down menus on their menu bar, the <b>menu</b> <b>title</b> acting like the key label.|$|E
50|$|A {{mnemonic}} is an underlined alphanumeric character, typically {{appearing in}} a <b>menu</b> <b>title,</b> menu item, or {{the text of}} a button or component of the user interface. A mnemonic indicates to the user which key to press (in conjunction with the Alt key) to activate a command or navigate to a component.|$|E
50|$|Renault {{were seen}} as {{the team to beat}} {{before the start of the}} year, with Alain <b>Menu</b> <b>title</b> favourite. The Laguna however was totally outclassed by the Audi A4 and Menu would finish a distant runner up to Biela. Will Hoy endured a tough season and joined Ford for the {{following}} year.|$|E

5000|$|Menus — Similar to menus seen in Mac OS, but <b>menu</b> <b>titles</b> are instead {{presented}} {{at the bottom of}} the screen in small rectangles, making them similar to buttons with attached [...] "pop-up" [...] menus.|$|R
5000|$|Video game soundtracks {{are often}} {{released}} after a game's release, usually {{consisting of the}} background music from the game's levels, <b>menus,</b> <b>title</b> screens, promo material (such as entire songs of which only segments {{were used in the}} game), cut-screens and occasionally sound-effects used in the game (Examples: Sonic Heroes, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{menu bar}} in Microsoft Windows is usually {{anchored}} {{to the top of}} a window under the title bar; therefore, there can be many menu bars on screen at one time. Menus in the menu bar can be accessed through shortcuts involving the Alt key and the mnemonic letter that appears underlined in the <b>menu</b> <b>title.</b> Additionally, pressing Alt or F10 brings the focus on the first menu of the menu bar.|$|E
50|$|The master Gopherspace {{search engine}} is Veronica. Veronica offers a keyword search {{of all the}} public Internet Gopher server <b>menu</b> <b>titles.</b> A Veronica search {{produces}} a menu of Gopher items, {{each of which is}} a direct pointer to a Gopher data source. Individual Gopher servers may also use localized search engines specific to their content such as Jughead and Jugtail.|$|R
50|$|DVD {{playback}} features {{minus the}} necessary decoders were integrated into Windows Media Player 8 for Windows XP. The player activates DVD and Blu-ray playback functionality with support for <b>menus,</b> <b>titles</b> and chapters, parental controls and audio track language selection if compatible decoders are installed. MPEG-2 and Dolby Digital (AC-3) decoders were included beginning with Windows Media Player 11 on Windows Vista (Home Premium and Ultimate editions only).|$|R
5000|$|This type {{of control}} is called a [...] "pop-up menu" [...] on the Macintosh platform, however the term [...] "popup menu" [...] is {{used to refer to}} context menus in other GUI systems. The Macintosh also has the notion of [...] "pull-down menus". The {{distinction}} is that, when the menu is closed, a pop-up <b>menu's</b> <b>title</b> shows the last-selected item while a pull-down menu shows a static <b>title</b> like a <b>menu</b> in the menu bar. Thus, the uses are different—popup menus are used to select a single option from a list while pull-down menus are used to issue commands or in cases where multiple options can be selected.|$|R
50|$|WindowLab is an X {{window manager}} for Unix-like systems. It {{is based on}} aewm and retains that window manager's small and {{lightweight}} nature. In many aspects, WindowLab has looked to the Amiga's user interface for inspiration without cloning it completely. Its top-level menu bar is accessed by a right click as on the Amiga and it follows Fitts's law of usability in that once the mouse enters the menu area it is constrained there in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Unlike on the Amiga, the menu bar is not controlled by applications; it is a global launcher menu which is populated by a dot file in the user's home directory containing a list of <b>menu</b> <b>titles</b> and commands.|$|R
50|$|Public WAIS {{is often}} used as a full-text search engine for {{individual}} Internet Gopher servers, supplementing the popular Veronica system which only searches the <b>menu</b> <b>titles</b> of Gopher sites. WAIS and Gopher share the World Wide Web's client-server architecture and {{a certain amount of}} its functionality. The WAIS protocol is influenced largely by the z39.50 protocol designed for networking library catalogs. It allows a text-based search, and retrieval following a search. Gopher provides a free text search mechanism, but principally uses menus. A menu is a list of titles, from which the user may pick one. While Gopher Space is a web containing many loops, the menu system gives the user the impression of a tree.|$|R
5000|$|The rise of Gopher (created in 1991 by Mark McCahill at the University of Minnesota) led to two new search programs, Veronica and Jughead. Like Archie, {{they searched}} the file names and titles stored in Gopher index systems. Veronica (Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to Computerized Archives) {{provided}} a keyword search of most Gopher <b>menu</b> <b>titles</b> {{in the entire}} Gopher listings. Jughead (Jonzy's Universal Gopher Hierarchy Excavation And Display) was a tool for obtaining menu information from specific Gopher servers. While {{the name of the}} search engine [...] "Archie Search Engine" [...] was not a reference to the Archie comic book series, [...] "Veronica" [...] and [...] "Jughead" [...] are characters in the series, thus referencing their predecessor.|$|R
5000|$|The {{game has}} a {{shortened}} version of [...] "Genocide" [...] by The Offspring in the <b>title</b> <b>menu.</b>|$|R
5000|$|From System 1 through Mac OS 7.6, {{the default}} system fonts for Mac OS were Chicago for <b>menus</b> and window <b>titles</b> and Geneva for Finder icons, {{and they could}} not be customized. Actually, the fonts for Finder icons became {{customizable}} starting in System 7. It is accessible in the [...] "Views" [...] control panel. In Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9, the default system font was changed to Charcoal <b>menus</b> and window <b>titles,</b> but it could be customized in Preferences.|$|R

Shaston was described in Apple IIGS technote #41 as [...] "a modified Helvetica", but the similarities are not striking. The fonts of the original Macintosh were also available for the GS.|$|R
50|$|A Canadian (Region 1) {{edition of}} Livres 1 and 2 (similar to the French Collector's edition) has been {{released}} in 2009 by Alliance Vivafilm. The edition is in French (<b>menus,</b> episode <b>titles,</b> etc.) but the episodes have English subtitles. The Addendum episodes (Dies Irae, pilots) do not have subtitles. The artwork inside the case {{is different from the}} French edition.|$|R

5000|$|Classic Mac OS did not {{display a}} taskbar onscreen by default. Application {{switching}} prior to Mac OS 8.5 {{was done by}} clicking on an application's window or via a pull-down menu at the right end of the menu bar. Prior to version 8.5 the <b>menu's</b> <b>title</b> was the icon of the foreground application. Version 8.5 introduced the ability to optionally also display the application name and to [...] "tear off" [...] the menu by dragging the title with the mouse. The torn off menu was displayed as a palette. The palette window could be configured using AppleScript to appear much like a taskbar, with no title bar and fixed to one edge of the screen. No control panel was provided by Apple to access this functionality, but third-party developers quickly wrote applications that allowed users unfamiliar with AppleScript to customize their application palettes. Third party taskbars such as DragThing were a popular category of shareware on these systems.|$|R
5000|$|The {{object is}} {{to win the game}} before 49 minutes expires. To do this, the players must collect six keys, one of each character's color, then head to the Well of Fears {{in the center of the}} board to face their [...] "greatest fear" [...] and finally press the <b>Menu</b> or <b>Title</b> button on the remote to win. However, if the {{countdown}} reaches zero, the Gatekeeper is declared the winner.|$|R
500|$|Madlax {{also plays}} {{as the story}} of Margaret Burton's search for her {{psychological}} identity. Based on the Mashimo <b>Menu</b> theme <b>titles</b> available to her, Yuki Kajiura has suggested an interpretation that while searching for her memories, Margaret meets the other characters ("Gatekeepers") one after another and learns about the lifestyles ("Gates") they represent. In the end, she finds her own [...] "Gate", which is the new identity that finally replaces the one she lost twelve years ago.|$|R
5000|$|Windows DVD Maker, a {{companion}} program to Windows Movie Maker {{that provides the}} ability to create video DVDs based on a user's content. Users can design a DVD with <b>title,</b> <b>menus,</b> video, soundtrack, pan and zoom motion effects on pictures or slides.|$|R
5000|$|The PlayCable channel was {{broadcast}} through a special data channel within the FM Band {{of the cable}} line. Special PlayCable adapters would {{be connected to the}} cable line. Users would tune to the PlayCable channel, which showed a <b>menu</b> of <b>titles</b> that could be played and used a keypad to select the desired game. The adapter would wait for the code of the selected title to show up in the data stream, then download the game to the adapter's internal memory for play.|$|R
5000|$|Whereas the NES version {{requires}} {{players to}} input {{a form of}} the Konami Code in order to access the Option screen, the Famicom version has it accessible by default from the <b>title</b> <b>menu.</b> Entering the Konami Code in the Famicom version will simply return a generic congratulatory screen instead.|$|R
50|$|Configuring an HP OXPd {{application}} on an HP LaserJet (Flow) MFP {{requires an}} icon or button {{for the top}} level <b>menu,</b> a <b>title,</b> {{a description of the}} web application, and the URL of the web application. When users press the menu button a browser application is launched and the URL is retrieved from the remote web server and displayed on the device control panel. Users interact with the remote web application via a dynamically rich touch-based graphical control panel. HP OXP configuration services provide web application developers a method for configuring the browser-based control panel on the HP OXP-enabled device.|$|R
5000|$|The song <b>titles</b> <b>menu</b> on the DVD spells {{the name}} of the song on track 13 as [...] "Baba O'Reilly". Blue Man Group jokingly (and incorrectly) asserts that this {{alternate}} spelling is Pete Townshend's intended spelling and attributes the spelling [...] "Baba O'Riley" [...] to a transcription error in the artwork for the album Who's Next by The Who.|$|R
5000|$|Playback of {{recordings}} on regular DVD-Video players, including <b>title</b> <b>menus</b> and edits. For DVD+RW discs, playback {{is possible}} without finalization, provided the player can read DVD+RW discs. For DVD+R a finalization step {{is required in}} order to allow the media to play back on a regular DVD player, however, may be playable on another DVD recorder.|$|R
5000|$|Ten Years of Fuckin' Up (FAT590) is a VHS {{video of}} NOFX {{released}} November 8, 1994 and re-released October 7, 2003 on DVD. The video included 19 live tracks of performance.
