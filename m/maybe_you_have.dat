He also bought the film rights to Jim Marrs' book Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy. One of the filmmaker's primary goals with JFK was to provide a rebuttal to the Warren Commission's report that he believed was [...] "a great myth. And in order to fight a myth, <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to create another one, a counter-myth." [...] Even though Marrs' book collected many theories, Stone was hungry for more and hired Jane Rusconi, a recent Yale University graduate, to lead a team of researchers and assemble as much information about the assassination as possible while the director completed post-production on Born on the Fourth of July. Stone read two dozen books on the assassination while Rusconi read between 100 and 200 books on the subject.|$|E

Look, picking potatoes is every bit as worthy as playing a guitar. But I can tell you that a man -with fine, sensitive fingers is not going to be able to make a go of picking potatoes: and I can also tell you that a man with fingers swollen from picking potatoes is not going to be able to play a guitar because he hasn't got the manual dexterity and he hasn't got the dedication. This is a profession like any other which you have to dedicate yourself to completely. It is an art of professionals." ...|$|E

The package was received this week in good condition + I was certainly pleased with it. We are, at present, in the second week of our basic course, second term, after returning from a 7 day furlough which ware given every 12 weeks to those who are fortunate to continue in the program. This program is one which keeps us on the move from 06 : 30 to 2300 every day except for weekends. We now have to learn and learn fast of we will be too far behind to keep up with the studies. Life has a little too much military life so we can only say we are the army getting an education- not college students. Everyday is routine; very little excitement. Best Regards to all“Bill” Bliven.
