Power windows and locks were not standard equipment on the base trim. The minimal price tag differential resulted in low consumer demand, and as a result, the low-line model was eventually discontinued. Additional standard features included a driver-side air bag (starting in 96) and four-wheel anti-lock braking system (ABS). The Laredo was the mid-scale model with standard features that included power windows, power door locks, cruise control, and a leather wrapped steering wheel. Exterior features included medium-grey plastic paneling on the lower body and five-spoke alloy wheels. The Limited was the premium model, featuring body color lower body paneling, and gold exterior accents. The Limited also boasted standard features such as leather seating, heated mirrors, front power seats, a keyless entry system, wood grain interior appliqué, lace style alloy wheels, a driver information center with compass, digitized climate control, and electrochromic rearview mirror, and Jensen brand stereo with <b>multi-band</b> equalizer.

Heterodyning of two individually filtered optical pulses that are pre-chirped via wavelength-to-time mapping generates wideband linearly-chirped radar signal. The working bands can be flexibly tailored with desired bandwidth at user-preferred carrier frequency. After modulated onto the pre-chirped optical pulse, radar echoes are time-stretched and frequency-compressed by several times. The digitization becomes much easier without loss of detection ability.

40|$|Abstract – Feature {{extraction}} of multispectral {{remote sensing image}} is an important task before classifying the image. When land areas are clustered into groups of similar land cover, {{one of the most}} important things is to extract the key features of a given image. Usually multispectral remote sensing images have many bands, and there may have been much redundancy information and it becomes difficult to extract the key features of the image. Therefore, it is necessary to study methods regarding how to extract the main features of the image effectively. In this paper, five methods are comparatively studied to reduce the <b>multi-bands</b> into lower dimensions in order to extract the most available features. These methods include the Euclid distance measurement (EDM), the discrete measurement criteria function (DMCF), the minimum differentiated entropy (MDE), the probability distance criterion (PDC), and the principle component analysis (PCA) method.
