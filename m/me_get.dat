500|$|In May 2012 Daft Punk's {{collaboration}} with Giorgio Moroder was announced—Moroder had recorded a monologue {{about his life}} {{for use in a}} track on the album. Rodgers was also present during the Moroder recording session. Moroder clarified that he was not involved in the composition of the track or its use of a synthesizer: [...] "They did not let <b>me</b> <b>get</b> involved at all. Thomas asked me if I wanted {{to tell the story of}} my life. Then they would know what to do with it."

500|$|A remixed and remastered version, {{featuring}} four bonus tracks, {{was released}} in 2004 through Capitol Records {{as part of the}} group's reissued back catalogue. According to the liner notes of the remastered version of Cryptic Writings, Dave Mustaine had to alter many lyrics at the request of their new manager, Bud Prager. The liner notes suggest that Mustaine was not a fan of the changes, but other interviews indicate the band actively sought and eventually accepted Prager's advice for the album. [...] "I figured maybe this guy (Prager) could help <b>me</b> <b>get</b> that intangible number one record I wanted so badly", Mustaine wrote in the liner notes.|$|E
500|$|... "Birthday" [...] {{contains}} elements of funk-pop, synthpop, and disco house. The song {{is backed by}} a [...] "busy but buoyant" [...] instrumentation featuring a [...] "deeply rhythmic impulse". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times felt [...] "Birthday" [...] was a musically updated version of disco, achieved by replacing [...] "cheesy strings" [...] with [...] "jerky breaks and synth washes". Its [...] "joyful" [...] lyrics present the commemoration of her partner's birthday {{as a metaphor for}} sexual intercourse. The bridge section of [...] "Birthday", which sees Perry singing [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>get</b> you in your birthday suit / It's time to bring out the big balloons", was found by Ben Rattliff to resemble French duo Daft Punk's works.|$|E

500|$|The nightly in-character guest {{interviews}} were initially {{of concern to}} Colbert, who worried his character's belligerent nature would be off-putting to guests. However, since the show's debut, {{he says he has}} found he is able to [...] "slide the intensity" [...] of his behavior depending on his interviewee's ability to respond to his aggressive approach. Colbert now often cites the interview segment as his favorite part of the show, because it allows him to improvise. Colbert advises his guests to disabuse the character of his ignorance. [...] "Don't let <b>me</b> <b>get</b> away with anything. Don't try to play my game. Be real. Be passionate. Hold your ideas. Give me resistance. Give me traction I can work against." ...|$|E

Ward's sixth studio album Hold Time and contributed a cover version of The Smiths' [...] "Please, Please, Please, Let <b>Me</b> <b>Get</b> What I Want" [...] to the (500) Days of Summer soundtrack. Deschanel penned eleven tracks for their followed-up release Volume Two (2010), where her lyrics touch on themes of romance and self-appreciation. The following year saw both artists performed three songs for the animated musical film Winnie the Pooh, including {{the theme song}} and an original composition named [...] "So Long". For the latter work, Deschanel received a Grammy nomination for Best Song Written for Visual Media at its 54th ceremony. The duo's first Christmas album A Very She & Him Christmas was released in 2011, in which they recorded twelve cover versions of Christmas standards {{over the course of}} six days.|$|E
500|$|After the {{extensive}} world tour {{in support of}} Youthanasia, Megadeth took time off late in 1995. Mustaine began work on MD.45, a side project with vocalist Lee Ving of Fear. The duo hired drummer Jimmy DeGrasso, who had played with Alice Cooper on the South American Monsters of Rock tour earlier that year. Marty Friedman built a studio in his new home in Phoenix and completed his fourth solo album, released in April 1996. In September 1996, Megadeth went to London to work on songs for the next album. The songwriting was closely supervised by new manager Bud Prager, who contributed musical ideas and lyrics; many lyrics and song titles were changed at his request. Regarding Prager's influence, Mustaine later wrote: [...] "I figured maybe this guy [...] could help <b>me</b> <b>get</b> that intangible number one record I so badly wanted." [...] The album, recorded in Nashville, was Megadeth's first collaboration with country pop producer Dann Huff, who had met Mustaine in 1990.|$|E

500|$|The {{remains of}} the crew members of HH-53C Jolly Roger 67—Chapman, Call, Avery, Prater, and Pearson, and Alley—were {{returned}} to the United States on October 1, 1997. The six were honored on November 19, 1997 in a full military funeral at Arlington National Cemetery and a headstone commemorating all six airmen was placed at the site. Hambleton was unable to attend due to poor health, but a letter from him was read. He wrote, [...] "They deserve all the accolades that we, the living, can bestow upon them. Again, I thank them, I honor them, and I will always hold great faith in my heart with them." [...] Clark was present. He told {{the families of the}} downed fliers that [...] "Each of you played a distinct role and forming the character of these men who so willingly paid a very dear price to help <b>me</b> <b>get</b> out of the jungles of Vietnam.

500|$|Kesha re-recorded [...] "Dirty Picture" [...] for {{her debut}} studio album, Animal. The song was {{selective}} in its release only being sold as an album bonus track in United Kingdom and Ireland, and was dubbed [...] "Kesha edit" [...] or [...] "Dirty Picture, Pt. 2". The song {{is similar to}} the original recording of the song with the only noticeable change being that Kesha now sings the song's first verse. While being interviewed by Digital Spy Cruz explained how the cover initially came about and his view on the cover, [...] "she asked me if she could do a version of the song where she sang the first verse and I thought that was a really cool idea. I really like both versions, and it's good that there are these two different versions out there, because fans of <b>me</b> <b>get</b> more of me on mine and [...] fans get more of her on hers." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the songs}} they worked together, [...] "It's You", {{was said to be}} one of the album's centerpiece, with Malik commenting: [...] "I just felt like I needed to put myself out there, just because it was a form of therapy for me and it did help <b>me</b> <b>get</b> through some shit. If I can help someone else at that time, that’s cool." [...] Dan Hyman from [...] Pitchfork Media stated that the song shared {{similarities}} with Ocean’s [...] "Bad Religion", with Ho mentioning that after hearing the song live and Zayn's fans noting similarities between both songs, he found them similar with the organ. [...] "It's You" [...] premiered during Zane Lowe's Beats One Radio on 25 February 2016, and a day later, 26 February 2016, it was released as the first promotional single from Zayn's debut solo studio album Mind of Mine (2016), along with the pre-order of the album on the iTunes Store.|$|E
