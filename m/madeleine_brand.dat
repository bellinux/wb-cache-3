2500|$|In 2003, Iranian {{expatriate}} Azar Nafisi {{published the}} memoir Reading Lolita in Tehran about a covert women's reading group. In an NPR interview Nafisi contrasts the sorrowful and seductive sides of Dolores/Lolita's character. She notes [...] "Because {{her name is}} not Lolita, her real name is Dolores which as you know in Latin means dolour, so her real name is associated with sorrow and with anguish and with innocence, while Lolita becomes a sort of light-headed, seductive, and airy name. The Lolita of our novel is both of these {{at the same time}} and in our culture here today we only associate it with one aspect of that little girl and the crassest interpretation of her." [...] Following Nafisi's comments, the NPR interviewer, <b>Madeleine</b> <b>Brand,</b> lists as embodiments of the latter side of Lolita, [...] "the Long Island Lolita, Britney Spears, the Olsen twins, and Sue Lyon in Stanley Kubrick's Lolita".|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Brand became {{host of the}} new daily Southern California Public Radio program The <b>Madeleine</b> <b>Brand</b> Show, on {{the public}} radio station KPCC, which aired between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. Pacific time. The show {{broadcast}} from the Mohn Broadcast Center in Pasadena. [...] The show was popular for its first 23 months, and was the station's most-listened-to in-house program (with the highest Arbitron rankings), and won a number of radio journalism awards. However, the show came to an [...] "abrupt end" [...] after KPCC paired Brand with longtime ESPN sports reporter A Martínez {{in an attempt to}} attract more Latino listeners and fulfill the requirements of a $6 million Corporation for Public Broadcasting grant. The pairing of the two hosts, under the name Brand & Martínez, debuted August 13, 2012, but lasted just four weeks and was a failure, in part because the two had met only twice before the program began. Brand left the station in September 2012 and was replaced by Alex Cohen (the show was renamed Take Two).|$|E
