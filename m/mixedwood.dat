25|$|There {{are several}} factors which {{influence}} the <b>mixedwood</b> {{stands in the}} boreal forest.|$|E
25|$|The <b>mixedwood</b> forest {{wetlands}} consist {{mainly of}} bogs, fens and marshes. Black spruce, tamarack, willow and bog and sphagnum mosses {{are the major}} vegetation types found in these lowlands. Dwarf birch and sedges cover large, wet areas with jack pine occurring on the sandy ridges.|$|E
25|$|Wildlife in the parklands include moose (Alces alces), {{white-tailed deer}} (Odocoileus virginianus), black bear (Ursus americanus), coyote (Canis latrans), {{northern}} pocket gophers (Thomomys talpoides), thirteen-lined ground squirrels, Richardson’s ground squirrels, North American beaver (Castor canadensis), snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), weasels and gray wolf (canis lupus). Bear, moose, foxes, coyotes, beaver, snowshoe hare and red squirrels are found {{most often in}} the <b>mixedwood</b> stands compared to the aspen forests and spruce forests.|$|E

30|$|Restoration of hardwood-pine (Pinus L.) <b>mixedwoods</b> is an {{important}} management goal in many pine plantations in the southern Cumberland Plateau in north-central Alabama, USA. Pine plantations have been relatively unmanaged since initiation, and thus include a diversity of hardwoods developing in the understory. These unmanaged pine plantations have become increasingly vulnerable to insects, and management activities were initiated to facilitate transition towards hardwood-pine <b>mixedwoods.</b> We evaluated a combination of thinning and prescribed fire prescriptions in a randomized complete block design with a 3 × 3 factorial treatment arrangement and four replications of each treatment. Treatments were combinations of thinning to three residual basal areas (no thin, light thin to 17.2 m 2 ha− 1, heavy thin to 11.5 m 2 ha− 1) and three prescribed burn applications (no burn, one burn to be repeated every 9 years, three burns repeated every 3 years). Burning without thinning altered stand structure by reducing overstory stem density by 15 %, whereas thinning without burning reduced density by 70 % and burning coupled with thinning resulted in reduced overstory trees by 72 %. Frequent fire had {{the greatest impact on}} midstory structure and regeneration. Midstory stem density was reduced by 90 % following thinning and burning. Oaks (Quercus L.) and red maple (Acer rubrum L.) were the most common understory species after thinning only, burning only, and thinning combined with burning. There were more oak and red maple seedling sprouts following frequent burning. Currently, > 75 % of red maple sprouts dominate the regeneration, compared to only 40 % of the oaks. Although the treatments have accelerated the transition toward hardwood-pine <b>mixedwoods,</b> the fate of oak and which hardwood species will be dominant in the future remains uncertain.|$|R
40|$|Partial {{harvesting}} {{has been}} proposed as a key aspect to implementing ecosystem management in the Canadian boreal forest. We report on a replicated experiment located in boreal <b>mixedwoods</b> of Northwestern Quebec. In the winter of 2000 – 2001, two partial harvesting treatments, one using a dispersed pattern, and a second, which created a (400 m 2) gap pattern, were applied to a 90 -year-old aspen-dominated mixed stand. The design also included a clear cut and a control. Over {{the course of the}} following eight years, live tree, coarse woody debris, regeneration and ground beetles were inventoried at variable intervals. Our results indicate that all harvesting treatments created conditions favorable to balsam fir (Abies balsamea) sapling growth and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) sapling recruitment. However, balsam fir and trembling aspen regeneration and ground beetles response to gap cuts were closer to patterns observed in clear cuts than in dispersed harvesting. The underlying reasons for these differing patterns can be linked to factors associated with the contrasting light regimes created by the two partial harvesting treatments. The study confirms that partially harvesting is an ecologically sound approach in boreal <b>mixedwoods</b> and could contribute to maintaining the distribution of stand ages at the landscape level...|$|R
25|$|Floodplain {{deposits}} in the Northwest Territory, Canada, {{are important in}} relation to the development of productive forest types with a component of white spruce (Jeffrey 1964). The most recently exposed surfaces are occupied by sandbar vegetation or riparian shrub willows and alder (Alnus incana); with increasing elevation, the shrubs give way successively to balsam poplar and white spruce forest. In contrast, older floodplains, with predominantly brown wooded soils, typically carry white spruce–trembling aspen <b>mixedwood</b> forest.|$|E
25|$|According the World Wide Fund for Nature the Canadian Aspen {{forests and}} parklands (NA0802) {{encompass}} eight ecoregions {{as used in}} the Ecological Framework of Canada: the Peace Lowland, Western Boreal, Boreal Transition, Interlake Plain, Aspen Parkland, and Southwest Manitoba Uplands (TEC 138, 143, 149, 155, 156, 161, 163, and 164). These ecoregions lie in both the Boreal Plains Ecozone and the Prairies Ecozone (Ecological Stratification Working Group 1995). The Boreal sections are Manitoba Lowlands, Aspen-Oak, Aspen Grove, <b>Mixedwood,</b> and Lower Foothills (15-17, 18a and 19a).|$|E
25|$|Southwestern Ontario and {{a narrow}} strip {{along the coast}} of the Saint Lawrence River are in the <b>Mixedwood</b> Plains, a fertile and {{productive}} ecozone that is typically flat with rolling hills, and was once covered by forest before its use for agriculture, and later urbanization, resulted in deforestation of vast swaths of the area. To its north is the Boreal Shield, the largest provincial ecozone, extending from south-central Ontario to cover most of northern Ontario, where it abuts the Hudson Plains. The Northwestern Ontario portion of this area is part of the Midwestern Canadian Shield forests ecoregion of boreal forest that spreads west through Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The plains that cover the heartland of Ontario are a transitional ecozone characterized by boreal features in the south and tundra landscapes in the north. This extends the entire range of the northern coast of Ontario with Hudson Bay and James Bay, at which numerous wetlands act as staging and nesting grounds for migratory birds. The waters of the two bays are in the Arctic Archipelago Marine ecozone, forming its southern, subarctic extent.|$|E
50|$|While not {{designed}} {{to be applied to}} boreal <b>mixedwoods,</b> the méthode du contrôle is described briefly here to illustrate the degree of sophistication applied by some European foresters to the management of their forests. Development of management techniques that allowed for stand development to be monitored and guided into sustainable paths were in part a response to past experience, particularly in Central European countries, of the negative effects of pure, uniform stands with species often unsuited to the site, which greatly increased the risk of soil degradation and biotic diseases. Increased mortality and decreased increment generated widespread concern, especially after reinforcement by other environmental stresses.|$|R
40|$|Although a {{good deal}} of post-fire {{vegetation}} development research has been done, {{there is a lack of}} information showing how western boreal <b>mixedwoods</b> regenerate after fire. The objective of our study was to conduct a broad survey using standard regeneration assessment protocols and evaluate regeneration attributes for fires 10 to 20 years after the fire disturbance. The heterogeneity in stand structure within the different fires was also of interest as well as the how late successional species Picea glauca is regenerating. Five fires in central and northern Alberta within the Lower Foothills and the Central <b>Mixedwoods</b> ecological subregions were selected. To compare the impact of different pre-fire composition on post-fire regeneration, we stratified the stands within the fires into broad classes (pure conifer, conifer dominated, deciduous dominated and pure deciduous stands) based on pre-fire regional forest inventory maps. Only post-fire stands with no anthropogenic disturbance were chosen. Within each stand we applied a systematic sampling design involving a 30 m inter-plot distance. For each 10 m 2 circular plot we recorded tree species, measured stump height diameter and the height of the tallest conifer and deciduous tree. Additionally, at every fourth plot ten individuals of each species were measured for height and diameter. A total of 506 plots were sampled in 22 stands. A variety of nonparametric comparisons have been performed. Preliminary results suggest that there is no significant difference between the two ecological subregions. The number of plots with at least one conifer seedling in conifer and in conifer dominated stands increased with the time since fire. The most common species found were Populus tremuloides and Populus balsamifera while the most common conifers were Pinus contorta and Pinus banksiana. Our preliminary results suggest that pre-fire stands dominated by Picea glauca regenerate as deciduous stands post fire...|$|R

40|$|We {{tested the}} effects of seed rain, safe sites, soil depth, overstory, and shrub layer on the {{establishment}} and recruitment of white pine (Pinus strobus L.) in aspen <b>mixedwoods</b> of the western Great Lakes region, U. S. A. Germin ant and seedling densities were positively related to seed rain and safe site characteristics that indicate moist conditions: high overstory basal area, decaying wood, and moss cover. Germinant and seedling densities were highest under dense overstory (> 16 m 2 /ha) and were unrelated to shrub cover. Sapling recruitment was greatest under low overstory density (5 cm. On deeper soil (~ 21 cm), overstory white pines occupied the shallowest soils (~ 18 cm) of all major overstory species, indicating that competition may cause white pine recruitment into the canopy to be lower on deeper soils. White pine populations {{in the study were}} initially spatially structured by seed rain and safe sites but sapling growth and recruitment was structured by overstory density, shrub cover, and soil depth...|$|R
25|$|Podzolized, brunisolic, luvisolic, gleysolic, and regosolic (immature) {{soils are}} typical of those {{supporting}} white spruce throughout {{the range of the}} species (Nienstaedt 1957). Soils supporting white spruce are most commonly Alfisols or Inceptisols (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). In the podzol region of Wisconsin, white spruce occurs on loam podzols, podzolized gley loams, strongly podzolized clays, gley-podzol clays, stream-bottom soils, and wood peat (Wilde et al. 1949). Moist sandy loams also support good growth (Harlow and Harrar 1950). On sandy podzols (Wilde et al. 1949), it is usually a minor species (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). Good development occurs on moist alluvium (Seeley, cited by Nienstaedt 1957; Jeffrey 1961, 1964; Lacate et al. 1965; Viereck 1973) on the banks of streams and borders of swamps (Sargent 1898, Kenety 1917, Rowe 1972). White spruce makes good growth on well-drained lacustrine soils in Alberta <b>Mixedwoods</b> (Heger 1971), on moderately-well-drained clay loams in Saskatchewan (Kabzems 1971), and on melanized loams and clays (with sparse litter and a dark-coloured organically-enriched mineral horizon) in the Algoma district of Ontario (Wilde et al. 1954).|$|R
50|$|Management of <b>mixedwoods</b> in the Prairie Provinces in the 1990s usually used clearcutting. When aspen is {{the main}} species to be regenerated, little {{treatment}} {{is applied to the}} site, but slash piles, compaction of soil, and damage to aspen root systems are minimized as much as is feasible in order to encourage suckering. In the coniferous harvest, aspen that is not harvested is usually left standing to reduce suckering, {{as well as for the}} benefit of wildlife. Regeneration of white spruce is more difficult. In general, plantation techniques are used, with mechanical site preparation following clearcutting. Depending on site conditions and availability of equipment, disk trenching, double disking, blading, ripper, or Marttiini plowing, Bracke spot scarification, high-speed mixing, or spot mounding are used. Plantings of white spruce have come to favour the use of large container or transplant stock. In the early years after clearcutting, site preparation and planting, shade-intolerant vegetation, such as aspen, Calamagrostis canadensis, and green alder compete strongly with the young outplants, frequently causing death.|$|R

30|$|Silvicultural {{prescriptions}} {{are designed}} to mimic natural disturbance regimes via an array of treatments that favor regeneration and dominance of desired species, and consider initial stand conditions, site factors and the ecology of desired species. Desired species, such as the upland oaks, are preferred for their economics (timber value) and ecology (wildlife habitat value). Most tree species are adapted to {{a particular type of}} disturbance regime; for example, upland oaks are adapted to relatively frequent and mixed-severity fire regimes, while maples (less desired in these systems) can rise to dominance in disturbance regimes that result in small canopy gaps in the absence of fire (Nowacki and Abrams 2008, McEwan et al. 2011). Developing silvicultural prescriptions that mimic natural disturbance regimes in highly diverse forests is challenging because the preferred disturbance regime is species-dependent, and there is broad amplitude in the ecology of competing species. We lack knowledge of how different combinations of silvicultural practices to guide forest regeneration and succession affect future forest composition and productivity when combinations of the two types of disturbances (from above or below) are applied in unmanaged Southern pine plantations to restore hardwood-pine <b>mixedwoods.</b>|$|R
50|$|Coates is an 80-acre {{conservation}} area located north of Calmar in Leduc County, near Edmonton. The natural area was donated to EALT by Ethel Coates. The area consists {{almost entirely of}} parkland forest, a habitat that is rapidly disappearing. It is located within an Environmentally Significant Area of Regional Importance and High Sensitivity. The area is located within the Willow Creek wildlife corridor, which provides both habitat {{and access to the}} North Saskatchewan River for moose, coyote, beaver, porcupine, wood frogs, crayfish, red-tailed hawks, great blue herons, yellow-bellied sapsuckers, mourning doves, eastern phoebes, ravens and chickadees. Coates is covered by <b>mixedwoods</b> forest including aspen, poplar, birch and spruce tree species as well as red-osier dogwood, prickly rose, wild raspberry, honeysuckle and fern species. The area contains a creek and adjacent plants such as willows, bullrushes, reeds and sedges. Also in the area is a white spruce forest with fairybells, wintergreen, twinflower, wild strawberry and stair-step moss.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{potential}} of mixed forest stands as better aboveground carbon sinks than pure stands. According to the facilitation and niche complementarity hypotheses, we predict higher carbon sequestration in mature boreal <b>mixedwoods.</b> Aboveground carbon contents of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) Britton, Sterns, Poggenb.) and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) mixtures were investigated in the eastern boreal forest, whereas jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) and trembling aspen {{were used in the}} central boreal forest. No carbon gain was found in species mixtures; nearly pure trembling aspen stands contained the greatest amount of aboveground carbon, black spruce stands had the least, and mixtures were intermediate with amounts that could generally be predicted by linear interpolation with stem proportions. These results suggest that for aspen, the potentially detrimental effect of spruce on soils observed in other studies may be offset by greater light availability in mixtures. On the other hand, for black spruce, the potentially beneficial effects of aspen on soils could be offset by greater competition by aspen for nutrients and light. The mixture of jack pine and trembling aspen did not benefit any of these species while inducing a loss in trembling aspen carbon at the stand level...|$|R

30|$|Forests on the Cumberland Plateau {{in southeastern}} USA contain an {{amalgamation}} of species {{with a range}} of shade tolerances, regeneration mechanisms, and competitive capabilities (Hinkle et al. 1993). Variation in site characteristics such as elevation, soil moisture, and fertility levels create environmental gradients that add to the region’s diversity in natural communities (Hinkle et al. 1993, Clatterbuck et al. 2006). Forest diversity has also been influenced by the history of land use and shifting complex major disturbances. Lands were cleared for agriculture in the 1800 s, heavy timber cutting and wildfires were prominent in the early 1900 s, and the demise of the American chestnut (Castanea dentata [Marsh.] Borkh.) occurred in the 1930 s (Hart and Grissino-Mayer 2008). Beginning in the 1950 s, native forests were converted to pine (Pinus spp. L.) plantations over large areas of the Cumberland Plateau, but many stands were left unmanaged and hardwoods reestablished among the pines, resulting in <b>mixedwoods.</b> Recent infestations of southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis Zimm.) that caused widespread decline and mortality in Southern yellow pines illuminated the negative consequences of simplifying forest composition and structure across the landscape. Hence, goals and objectives to restore the currently pine-dominated forests to more closely resemble their historical composition and structure, which would diversify the forests of the Cumberland Plateau, were adopted by natural resource agencies (e.g., USDA Forest Service 2003). The potential for restoring native forests after decades of conversion to pine plantations, however, is currently unknown.|$|R

5000|$|The {{diversity}} of boreal and sub-boreal broadleaf-conifer mixed tree species stands, {{commonly referred to}} as the [...] "mixedwoods", largely preclude the utility of generalizations and call for the development of management practices incorporating the greater inherent complexity of broadleaf-conifer mixtures, relative to single-species or mixed-species conifer forest. After harvesting or other disturbance, <b>mixedwood</b> stands commonly enter a prolonged period in which hardwoods overtop the coniferous component, subjecting them to intense competition in an understorey. It is well established that the regeneration and growth potential of understorey conifers in <b>mixedwood</b> stands is correlated to the density of competing hardwoods. To help apply [...] "free-to-grow" [...] regulations in British Columbia and Alberta, management guidelines based on distance-dependent relations within a limited radius of crop trees were developed, but Lieffers et al.
