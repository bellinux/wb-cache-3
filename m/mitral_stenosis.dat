The patient's symptoms immediately improved after the procedure, with no procedure-related complications. The mean pressure gradient across the valve decreased to 19 mmHg, and the mitral valve area increased to 1. 21 cm(2) in postprocedural echocardiography. We conducted a literature search and identified 26 cases of balloon valvuloplasty for degenerated bioprosthetic valves. Of these, 14 cases were bioprosthetic mitral valves, and the results were favorable. However, more case reports are required to establish an evidence base for future expert recommendation of balloon valvuloplasty of prosthetic mitral valve.

A successive analysis carried out to predict those patients with <b>mitral</b> valve <b>stenosis</b> who are at risk of developing paroxysmal atrial fibrillation showed that the P-wave duration and the amplitudes (in the range 60 - 106 Hz) were the most distinctive parameters, but, unfortunately, without any significant difference with respect to those of patients with <b>mitral</b> valve <b>stenosis</b> alone. Finally, some correlations between the age, the P-wave duration and the left atrial diameter of patients, were revealed to exist only in patients affected by episodes of atrial fibrillation...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{tricuspid valve}} (TV) {{is a complex}} {{structure}} (Lamers et al. (1995) [1]). The {{most common cause of}} pathologic tricuspid regurgitation is functional, due to annular dilatation with normal leaflet morphology (Sagie et al. (1994) [2]). Myxomatous disease of the tricuspid valve is often associated with mitral valve involvement but isolated tricuspid prolapse has been rarely reported (Tei et al. (1983) [3]). Unlike the common combination between rheumatic <b>mitral</b> valve <b>stenosis</b> and functional tricuspid regurgitation, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first case of such combination between tricuspid valve prolapse and rheumatic <b>mitral</b> valve <b>stenosis</b> reported with three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (3 D-TEE). Case presentation: We are presenting a 43 -year-old female patient that had dyspnea on effort NYHA class III. A transthoracic echocardiography showed severe rheumatic <b>mitral</b> valve <b>stenosis</b> with severe tricuspid regurgitation. A routine preoperative 2 D-transesophageal echocardiography (2 D-TEE) showed severe rheumatic <b>mitral</b> valve <b>stenosis</b> with severe tricuspid regurgitation due to prolapse of one of the tricuspid valve leaflets. 3 D-TEE showed prolapse of the medial half of the posterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve. These findings were confirmed during surgery and had led to a change in the surgical plan from traditional mitral valve replacement with tricuspid valve annuloplasty, to mitral valve replacement with tricuspid valve anatomical repair. Conclusion: The tricuspid valve is a complex structure. 2 D-TTE and TEE is not usually enough for complete delineation of the anatomy and pathology of the tricuspid valve. 3 D-TEE has an incremental value in providing informative en-face view of the three leaflets of the tricuspid valve that facilitates precise determination of its anatomy and pathology. This is a rare case of unusual combination between tricuspid valve prolapse and rheumatic <b>mitral</b> valve <b>stenosis...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Another {{method of}} {{measuring}} {{the severity of}} <b>mitral</b> <b>stenosis</b> is the simultaneous left and right heart chamber catheterization. The right heart catheterization (commonly known as Swan-Ganz catheterization) gives the physician the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, which {{is a reflection of}} the left atrial pressure. [...] The left heart catheterization, on the other hand, gives the pressure in the left ventricle. [...] By simultaneously taking these pressures, it is possible to determine the gradient between the left atrium and left ventricle during ventricular diastole, which is a marker for the severity of <b>mitral</b> <b>stenosis.</b> [...] This method of evaluating <b>mitral</b> <b>stenosis</b> tends to overestimate the degree of <b>mitral</b> <b>stenosis,</b> however, because of the time lag in the pressure tracings seen on the right-heart catheterization and the slow Y descent seen on the wedge tracings. [...] If a trans-septal puncture is made during right heart catheterization, however, the pressure gradient can accurately quantify the severity of <b>mitral</b> <b>stenosis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{natural history}} of <b>mitral</b> <b>stenosis</b> {{secondary}} to rheumatic fever (the most common cause) is an asymptomatic latent phase following the initial episode of rheumatic fever. [...] This latent period lasts an average of 16.3 ¬± 5.2 years. [...] Once symptoms of <b>mitral</b> <b>stenosis</b> begin to develop, progression to severe disability takes 9.2 ¬± 4.3 years.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Mitral</b> <b>stenosis</b> {{typically}} progresses slowly (over decades) {{from the}} initial signs of <b>mitral</b> <b>stenosis</b> to NYHA functional class II symptoms {{to the development of}} atrial fibrillation to the development of NYHA functional class III or IV symptoms. [...] Once an individual develops NYHA class III or IV symptoms, the progression of the disease accelerates and the patient's condition deteriorates.|$|E

2500|$|An opening snap {{that is a}} high-pitch {{additional}} sound may {{be heard}} after the A2 (aortic) component of the second heart sound (S2), which correlates to the forceful opening of the mitral valve.

[...] This happens in ventricular diastole (after closure of the aortic valve), when the pressure in the ventricle precipitously drops. [...] In individuals with <b>mitral</b> <b>stenosis,</b> the pressure in the left atrium correlates with the severity of the <b>mitral</b> <b>stenosis.</b> [...] As the severity of the <b>mitral</b> <b>stenosis</b> increases, the pressure in the left atrium increases, and the mitral valve opens earlier in ventricular diastole.|$|E
