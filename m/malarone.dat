50|$|The drug {{combination}} atovaquone/proguanil (INNs, trade names <b>Malarone,</b> Malanil) is an antimalarial medication {{used in both}} the treatment and prevention of malaria. Atovaquone alone is not indicated for treatment or prevention of malaria as monotherapy (i.e., without proguanil). Atovaquone/proguanil has been commercially available from GlaxoSmithKline since 2000, and its patent expired in 2013. <b>Malarone</b> has applications for treating chloroquine-resistant malaria.|$|E
50|$|Atovaquone, as a {{combination}} preparation with proguanil, has been commercially available from GlaxoSmithKline since 2000 as <b>Malarone</b> for the treatment and prevention of malaria.|$|E

50|$|A {{standard}} tablet of <b>Malarone</b> contains 100 mg of proguanil hydrochloride and 250 mg of atovaquone. A pediatric tablet contains 25 mg of proguanil hydrochloride and 62.5 mg of atovaquone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Malarone</b> {{is notable}} for having far fewer side effects than other, older malaria drugs. While some people {{experience}} side effects, such as coughing, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, loss of appetite, mouth sores, nausea, stomach pain, vomiting, or weakness, the majority have none or few of these.|$|E
50|$|Atovaquone is {{available}} in combination with proguanil under the name <b>Malarone,</b> albeit at a price higher than Lariam. It is commonly used in prophylaxis by travellers and used to treat falciparum malaria in developed countries. A liquid oral suspension of Atovaquone {{is available}} under the name Mepron.|$|E
50|$|Causal prophylactics target {{not only}} the blood stages of malaria, but the initial liver stage as well. This means that the user can stop taking the drug seven days after leaving the area of risk. <b>Malarone</b> and {{primaquine}} are the only causal prophylactics in current use.|$|E
5000|$|Intravenous {{quinidine}} is {{also indicated}} {{for treatment of}} Plasmodium falciparum malaria. [...] However, quinidine is not considered the first-line therapy for P. falciparum. The recommended treatments for P. falciparum malaria, according to the Toronto Notes 2008, are a combination of either quinine and doxycycline or atovaquone and proguanil (<b>Malarone).</b>|$|E
50|$|Chloroquine {{may be used}} {{where the}} {{parasite}} is still sensitive. However, due to resistance one of three medications: mefloquine (Lariam), doxycycline (available generically), and the combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride (<b>Malarone)</b> is frequently needed. Doxycycline and the atovaquone and proguanil combination are the best tolerated with mefloquine associated with higher rates of neurological and psychiatric symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Awakened is a 2013 drama/thriller film by Joycelyn Engle and Arno <b>Malarone.</b> The film stars Award-winning actress Julianne Michelle (Family Prayers, The House is Burning) as Samantha, who {{returns to}} her {{hometown}} believing that her father murdered her mother years ago. In her exhausting search for the truth about her young mother's untimely death 14 years earlier, Samantha receives help from beyond the grave.|$|E
50|$|Medical advice {{should always}} be taken before {{choosing}} a drug for malaria prevention. Because some strains of malaria are resistant, <b>Malarone</b> is not effective for malaria prevention {{in all parts of}} the world. It must be taken with a fatty meal or at least some milk to be absorbed adequately, and to avoid painful stomach irritation which proguanil frequently causes when taken without food. Also, stomach irritation may occur if one lies down within a half hour after taking this medicine.|$|E
5000|$|Cycloguanil is a {{dihydrofolate reductase}} inhibitor, {{and is a}} {{metabolite}} of the antimalarial drug proguanil; its formation in vivo has been thought to be primarily responsible for the antimalarial activity of proguanil. [...] However, more recent work has indicated that, while proguanil is synergistic with the drug atovaquone (as in the combination <b>Malarone),</b> cycloguanil is in fact antagonistic {{to the effects of}} atovaquone, suggesting that, unlike cycloguanil, proguanil may have an alternative mechanism of antimalarial action besides dihydrofolate reductase inhibition.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most common}} adverse effects involve {{a group of}} {{symptoms}} called cinchonism; almost everyone taking quinine has mild cinchonism , which can include headache, vasodilation and sweating, nausea, tinnitus, hearing impairment, vertigo or dizziness, blurred vision, and disturbance in color perception [...] More severe cinchonism includes vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, deafness, blindness, and disturbances in heart rhythms. [...] Cinchonism is much less common when quinine is given by mouth, but oral quinine is not well tolerated (quinine is exceedingly bitter and many patients will vomit after ingesting quinine tablets): Other drugs, such as Fansidar (sulfadoxine with pyrimethamine) or <b>Malarone</b> (proguanil with atovaquone), are often used when oral therapy is required. Quinine ethyl carbonate is tasteless and odourless, but is available commercially only in Japan. Blood glucose, electrolyte and cardiac monitoring are not necessary when quinine is given by mouth.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES To study a new combination, {{based on}} dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine (CV 8) and atovaquone/proguanil (<b>Malarone)</b> for {{treatment}} of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Vietnam. METHODS Vietnamese adults with falciparum malaria were allocated randomly to treatment with dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine/trimethoprim/primaquine 256 / 2560 / 720 / 40 mg (CV 8, n = 84) or <b>Malarone</b> 3000 / 1200 mg (n = 81), both over 3 days. Patients were followed-up for 28 days. RESULTS All patients recovered rapidly. The mean (95 % CI) parasite elimination half-life of CV 8 was 6. 8 h (6. 2 - 7. 4) and of <b>Malarone</b> 6. 5 h (6. 1 - 6. 9) (P = 0. 4).

40|$|Abstract. Malaria poses a {{major health}} risk {{to people who}} are exposed to {{infection}} in malaria-endemic areas. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of Malaroney (250 mg of atovaquone/ 100 mg of proguanil hydrochloride per tablet) for the chemoprophylaxis of Plasmodium falci-parum malaria in Zambia. Adult volunteers received a three-day treatment course of <b>Malarone</b> to eliminate pre-existing parasitemia and were then immediately randomized to treatment with either one <b>Malarone</b> tablet daily (n 5 136), or one placebo tablet daily (n 5 138) for at least 10 weeks. Malaria blood smears were prepared on a weekly basis and a failure of chemoprophylaxis was defined as any subject who had a positive blood smear, or who withdrew from the study due to a treatment-related adverse event. The prophylaxis success rates in the <b>Malarone</b> and placebo groups were 98 % and 63 %, respectively (P, 0. 001). The most commonly reported adverse events with at least a possible causal relationship to study medication were headache and abdominal pain, which occurred with a higher incidence in the placebo group. No subjects were withdrawn from the study due to a treatment-related adverse event. Thus, <b>Malarone</b> appears to have an excellent safety and efficacy profile for the chemoprophylaxis of P. falciparum infection. Despite efforts to contain the disease, malaria remains one of the greatest causes of morbidity and mortality in the trop-ical and subtropical parts of the world. 1 The World Healt...|$|E
40|$|Abstract <b>Malarone</b> ® (atovaquone-proguanil) is an {{effective}} drug for the treatment and prophylaxis of multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria. However, first cases of resistance have been reported, which are associated with mutations at codon 268 of the parasite's cytochrome b gene. We report the first case of <b>Malarone</b> ® treatment failure from Central Africa. Drug concentration was well within curative range. Pre- and post-treatment Plasmodium falciparum isolates revealed codon 268 wild-type alleles, and no other mutations of the putative atovaquone-binding domain. These findings illustrate the spread of atovaquone-proguanil-resistance in Africa and question the usefulness of codon 268 as the only target for the surveillance of its emergence. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{cytochrome}} bc(1) {{complex is}} a key mitochondrial enzyme that catalyses transfer of electrons maintaining the membrane potential of mitochondria. Currently, atovaquone is the only drug in clinical use targeting the Plasmodium falciparum bc(1) complex.

Cheaper alternatives that can overcome resistance are desperately required. Here we describe recent advances of bc(1) -targeted inhibitors that include hydroxynaphthoquinones (atovaquone analogues), pyridones (clodipol analogues), acridine related compounds (acridinediones and acridones) and quinolones.

However, using two biologic assays (mosquito transmission and in vitro asexual stage development), we demonstrate here that sera from volunteers treated with atovaquone/proguanil retained activity against Plasmodium falciparum up to 6 weeks after such treatment. This activity was due to atovaquone, as administration of this drug alone replicated the data obtained with the combination. Most notably, asexual stage development of an atovaquone-resistant strain (NGATV 01) of P. falciparum was not inhibited by sera taken after atovaquone treatment.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Atovaquone {{is part of}} the {{antimalarial}} drug combination atovaquone-proguanil (<b>Malarone)</b> and inhibits the cytochrome bc 1 complex of the electron transport chain in Plasmodium spp. Molecular modelling showed that amino acid mutations are clustered around a putative atovaquone-binding site resulting in a reduced binding affinity of atovaquone for plasmodial cytochrome b, thus resulting in drug resistance. METHODS: The prevalence of cytochrome b point mutations possibly conferring atovaquone resistance in Plasmodium falciparum isolates in atovaquone treatment-naïve patient cohorts from Lambaréné, Gabon and from South Western Ethiopia was assessed.
