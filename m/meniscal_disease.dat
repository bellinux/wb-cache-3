40|$|Patellofemoral {{arthralgia}} is a {{very common}} syndrome affecting athletes. Most often, examination fails to define true pathology. Conservative treatment, an active exercise program, and sports may be undertaken without harm to the knee. The patellofemoral arthralgia syndrome must be differentiated from true chondromalacia patella, where there is actual degeneration of the patella's articular cartilage, and from other sources of internal derangement such as <b>meniscal</b> <b>disease</b> or osteochondral lesions. Careful attention {{to the history of}} onset, and provoking activities such as climbing stairs, kneeling, and crouching, will allow the physician to recognize patellofemoral arthralgia. Other common overuse syndromes also should be looked for, and differentiated from problems due to true internal derangement...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} use of MRI in knee disorders, ultrasonography remains the first choice examination technique in para-articular disease. The technique is fast, cheap, easily accessible and usable in the acutely injured patient. The choice of equipment, positioning of the patient and some characteristics of normal anatomy are described. The routine applications of ultrasonography include different types of tendon disease, trauma of the collateral ligaments, bursal pathology, joint effusions and synovitis, evaluation of the popliteal fossa and para-articular swellings. Other possible applications, somewhat more depending on the examiner's experience, are <b>meniscal</b> <b>disease,</b> trauma to the cruciate ligaments and evaluation of the articular cartilage and synovial plicae. status: publishe...|$|E

Meniscal injury {{is one of the most}} common causes of pain and dysfunction in the human knee and canine stifle joint. In the canine patient, meniscal injury is usually secondary to cranial cruciate ligament rupture, and the resulting instability in the joint. Despite the prevalence of <b>meniscal</b> <b>disease,</b> the literature contains relatively few reports addressing mechanisms of disease for cranial cruciate ligament-associated meniscal injury. Diagnosis of meniscal tears can be challenging based on clinical signs and history alone, and diagnostic tests to confirm tearing can be expensive, invasive, and unavailable in some areas. Additionally, controversy remains regarding standard of care for treatment of the canine meniscus. Therefore, our overall line of research was to comprehensively characterize canine meniscal pathology with focus on three areas: 1) comparison of clinical and bench top measures of meniscal pathology in early <b>meniscal</b> <b>disease,</b> 2) comparison of diagnostic modalities for pathology of the caudal portion of the medial meniscus, and 3) investigation of the effects of a commonly utilized treatment of the medial meniscus...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Menisci play a {{vital role}} in load transmission, shock {{absorption}} and joint stability. There is increasing evidence suggesting that OA menisci may not merely be bystanders in the disease process of OA. This study sought: 1) to determine the prevalence of meniscal degeneration in OA patients, and 2) to examine gene expression in OA meniscal cells compared to normal meniscal cells. Methods Studies were approved by our human subjects Institutional Review Board. Menisci and articular cartilage were collected during joint replacement surgery for OA patients and lower limb amputation surgery for osteosarcoma patients (normal control specimens), and graded. Meniscal cells were prepared from these meniscal tissues and expanded in monolayer culture. Differential gene expression in OA meniscal cells and normal meniscal cells was examined using Affymetrix microarray and real time RT-PCR. Results The grades of meniscal degeneration correlated with the grades of articular cartilage degeneration (r = 0. 672; P HLA-DPA 1), integrin, beta 2 (ITGB 2), ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP 1), ankylosis, progressive homolog (ANKH) and fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF 7), were expressed at significantly higher levels in OA meniscal cells compared to normal meniscal cells. Importantly, many of the genes that have been shown to be differentially expressed in other OA cell types/tissues, including ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 5 (ADAMTS 5) and prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES), were found to be expressed at significantly higher levels in OA meniscal cells. This consistency suggests that many of the genes detected in our study are disease-specific. Conclusion Our findings suggest that OA is a whole joint <b>disease.</b> <b>Meniscal</b> cells may play an active role in the development of OA. Investigation of the gene expression profiles of OA meniscal cells may reveal new therapeutic targets for OA therapy and also may uncover novel disease markers for early diagnosis of OA. </p...|$|R
30|$|Root {{tears are}} a subset of meniscal injuries, which have become {{increasingly}} recognized {{as a cause of}} pain and impaired mobility. The root serves as the anchor point for the menisci. Occurring on either the medial or lateral meniscus, root tears refer to a radial tear or avulsion at the posterior horn attachment to the bone. Both radial tear and posterior horn avulsion defunction the menisci as load-bearing structures, with increasing local contact pressure and premature onset of knee arthritis [9]. Because the medial and lateral menisci differ in anatomy and biomechanics, the pathogenesis of posterior root avulsions is also different. Tearing of the lateral posterior meniscal root is traumatic and always associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury [1, 22], while the medial posterior root [2, 8, 10, 19] is prone to chronic degenerative <b>meniscal</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background We {{developed}} two objective structured {{clinical examinations}} (OSCEs) {{to educate and}} evaluate trainees in the evaluation and management of shoulder and knee pain. Our objective {{was to examine the}} evidence for validity of these OSCEs. Methods A multidisciplinary team of content experts developed checklists of exam maneuvers and criteria to guide rater observations. Content was proposed by faculty, supplemented by literature review, and finalized using a Delphi process. One faculty simulated the patient, another rated examinee performance. Two faculty independently rated a portion of cases. Percent agreement was calculated and Cohen 2 ̆ 019 s kappa corrected for chance agreement on binary outcomes. Examinees 2 ̆ 019 self-assessment was explored by written surveys. Responses were stratified into 3 categories and compared with similarly stratified OSCE scores using Pearson 2 ̆ 019 s coefficient. Results A multi-disciplinary cohort of 69 examinees participated. Examinees correctly identified rotator cuff and <b>meniscal</b> <b>disease</b> 88...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the pre-stress in the menisci {{of a human}} knee joint, the technique of microindentation was adopted. Five specimens each for lateral and medial menisci attached to the tibia were prepared from the knee joints of Korean cadavers to represent the pre-stress state of the meniscus. To create test specimens for the stress-free state of the meniscus, each meniscus was resected from the tibia and cut into three parts, which were subsequently attached to a metal plate. Indentations were carried out in each meniscus in both the pre-stress state and the stress-free state. The pre-stresses in the menisci were evaluated using the load-versus-depth curves. Compressive pre-stresses {{were found in the}} menisci. For each indentation region, the pre-stresses in the medial meniscus were higher than in the lateral meniscus. The highest pre-stress in both the lateral and medial meniscus was found in the posterior regions, while the anterior regions experienced the lowest pre-stress. The obtained pre-stresses can be used for the accurate numerical analysis, the fabrication of artificial menisci, and the diagnosis of <b>meniscal</b> <b>disease</b> progression for human knee joints. ope...|$|E
40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page (University of Missouri [...] Columbia, viewed on November 15, 2013). Meniscal fibrocartilaginous {{structures}} {{are subject to}} numerous stresses when performing its necessary functions to maintain intra-articular homeostasis. Pathological events causing a loss of tissue integrity will result in meniscal dysfunction, which will inevitably lead to the debilitating disease of osteoarthritis. When working to characterize osteoarthritic meniscal pathology, {{it was evident that}} the clinical assessment of radiography will correlate with gross and histologic measures of disease. These three scoring methods correlated well with the biochemical and molecular changes that occur when comparing normal to osteoarthritic menisci and medial to lateral osteoarthritic menisci. In order to more fully differentiate the abundant transformations that occur between aged-normal, meniscectomy, and osteoarthritic menisci, microarray and mass spectrometry analyses were utilized. Pathologic menisci appeared to haphazardly attempt an increase of its extracellular matrix components, some captivating markers of vascularity were increased, and a protein of potential therapeutic value was identified. Proteomic analysis was further utilized to study synovial fluid markers associated with <b>meniscal</b> <b>disease</b> and was able to identify a number of proteins with biomarker potential and a few additional proteins of therapeutic significance. These studies identified novel data that help to define the pathological changes a meniscus undergoes upon degradation...|$|E
40|$|Background {{and purpose}} - Current {{evidence}} suggests that arthroscopic knee surgery has no added benefit compared with non-surgical management in degenerative <b>meniscal</b> <b>disease.</b> Yet in many countries, arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM) remains among the most frequently performed surgeries. This study quantifies and characterizes {{the dynamics of the}} current use of knee arthroscopies in Switzerland in a distinctively non-traumatic patient group. Methods - We assessed a non-accident insurance plan of a major Swiss health insurance company for surgery rates of APM, arthroscopic debridement and lavage in patients over the age of 40, comparing the years 2012 and 2015. Claims were analyzed for prevalence of osteoarthritis, related interventions and the association of surgery with insurance status. Results - 648, 708 and 647, 808 people were examined in 2012 and 2015, respectively. The incidence of APM, debridement, and lavage was 388 per 10 (5) person-years in 2012 and 352 per 10 (5) person-years in 2015 in non-traumatic patients over the age of 40, consisting mostly of APM (96 %). Between years, APM surgery rates changed in patients over the age of 65 (p < 0. 001) but was similar in patients aged 40 - 64. Overall prevalence of osteoarthritis was 25 %. Insurance status was independently associated with arthroscopic knee surgery. Interpretation - APM is widely used in non-traumatic patients in Switzerland, which contrasts with current evidence. Many procedures take place in patients with degenerative knee disease. Surgery rates were similar in non-traumatic middle-aged patients between 2012 and 2015. Accordingly, the potential of inappropriate use of APM in non-traumatic patients in Switzerland is high...|$|E
40|$|The {{integrity}} of the semilunar cartilages {{has proved to be}} the best safeguard against mechanical degenerative changes. One can postulate that restoring normal congruency between the femur and tibia with intact menisci would be the ideal solution to many mechanical knee problems. Several semilunar cartilages have been transplanted with good functional results in medial and lateral compartmental <b>meniscal</b> <b>disease.</b> However, this form of chondroprotection in the load-bearing area of the femur and tibia can only be properly evaluated after 10 to 20 years of follow-up. In order to obtain functional results, meniscal allografts have to be incorporated in the knee joint by intimate meniscofemoral synovial bonding. The synovial fibroblasts must grow into the collagen meshwork of the meniscal allograft. Such ingrowth has been shown in freeze-dried and deep-frozen meniscal allografts. However, in a small number of transplants shrinking has been observed on repeat arthroscopy at 6 months. Satisfactory incorporation of meniscal allografts has been obtained with fresh allografts, but availability remains a problem when this method is used for meniscal substitution. For this reason viable meniscal allograft implantation was initiated in a series of 25 patients and the value of this method studied. The meniscal allograft can be kept in an adequate semisynthetic nutrient medium for approximately 2 - 3 weeks without apparent loss of viability, during which period the appropriate recipient can be selected and prepared, a thorough laboratory screening can be conducted, and the culture results and disease transmission factors can be evaluated. In this way, live transplant hazards can be avoided, resulting in a higher success rate...|$|E
