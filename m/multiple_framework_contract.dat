40|$|Manufacturer-retailer {{relationships}} {{demonstrate the}} existence of asymmetric relationships among companies. A large number of consumer goods manufacturers negotiate and conclude contracts with {{a small number of}} highly concentrated grocery retailers. Consumer goods manufacturers have expertise in the areas of sourcing, producing and marketing branded products which are demanded by consumers. However, these manufacturers need to obtain listing for their brands within few grocery retailers which represent a significant share of their business. Many companies choose to become dependent on other strong companies because of the benefits that derive from their relationships, even if they are asymmetric. The benefits may include securing substantial business size, cost advantages or rationalisation of production and supply, simplification of business process and business reliance. Mergers & acquisitions, shifting economic conditions, rapid technological changes, as well as global sourcing create conditions for growing asymmetric interdependencies among companies. The present paper deals with an increasingly important question, which is about how companies are contracting in these asymmetric relationships. Based on empirical research in manufacturer-retailer relationships that covered the period between 2002 and 2005, the study examines how companies use contracts to manifest their joint choices over time. In general, contracts are manifestations of consent that give legal effect to business relationships. In asymmetric relationships, such as manufacturer-retailer relationships, companies choose to retreat from immediate <b>contracts</b> and arrange <b>framework</b> <b>contracts</b> (often called umbrella agreements) to balance the need for certainty with the wish to remain sufficiently flexible (Mouzas and Ford, 2006). A <b>framework</b> <b>contract</b> between two companies is not concerned with contractual decisions. Instead it articulates a domain consensus by specifying the scope of business; defines the basic rules and principles that govern an interdependent symbiosis between the parties and expresses the inherent goal incompatibility between parties by mapping the parties’ relevant interests as well as their business assumptions. This research provides empirical evidence of three intriguing findings: a) <b>framework</b> <b>contracts</b> are made in established and continuing relationships and not in new untested relationships b) <b>framework</b> <b>contracts</b> are more important for the stronger party in asymmetric relationships and c) <b>framework</b> <b>contracts</b> do not mirror contractual decisions but provide a framework in which contractual decisions are made. The study discusses these findings and draws conclusions on the role of contracts and more widely on the nature of interdependence itself...|$|R

40|$|Consip is {{a public}} company owned by the Italian Ministry of Finance.

Italy's National Action Plan (NAP) on green public procurement (GPP) entered into force in 2008 and, since then, GPP {{has been one of the}} pillars of Consip's Rationalisation Programme. Consip's mission is to make the use of public resources more efficient and transparent, by providing tools and support to public administrations which enable them to carry out procurement procedures which foster competitive participation from enterprises. The objectives were to tender for a <b>framework</b> <b>contract</b> for print and copy management services for use by the entire Italian public sector. Consip's aim was to move away from single user printers and copiers which lead to a great deal of printing and thus higher costs. A mechanism called Click & Save (please note that this is not a brand name) was sought through the procurement, as it is a means for rewarding less printing. The <b>framework</b> <b>contract</b> also covered an optional service to manage leased office equipment (printers, photocopiers and fax machines). During the pre-procurement phase, a number of interviews were carried out with potential suppliers to discuss Energy Star requirements, design for disassembly and noise requirements...|$|R
