40|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>switch</b> {{is a type}} of {{inductor}} with magnetic core. It has {{a property}} of operating like as a switch using saturation and non-saturation region in hysteresis loop of magnetic materials. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>switch</b> has an advantage in high repetition rate and being usable in the high power field compared to semiconductor switches such as IGBT, Thyristor, and etc. However, it also has a limitation in reliability of the operation compared to semiconductor switches. For this reason, a lot of researches have been made to improve the reliability. To improve the reliability, previous researches have been conducted focusing on altering the value of the residual flux of the magnetic materials. In this paper, the relationship between the operation of switch and the change of initial magnetic flux has been analyzed by altering the DC-bias of the reset circuit. It is conducted on various structures of MPC system. Thus the interrelation of MPC system and the switching operation is analyzed.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} in which both Fanaroff and Riley class I and II extragalactic jets are produced by magnetized accretion disk coronae in the ergospheres of rotating black holes. It employs a hybrid version of the Blandford-Payne and Blandford-Znajek magnetohydrodynamic mechanisms (similar to the Punsly-Coroniti model, {{with the addition of}} a metric-shear-driven dynamo) and a generalized form of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>switch,</b> which is shown to be the MHD analog of the Eddington luminosity. While the jets are produced in the ergospheric accretion disk itself, the output power still is an increasing function of the black hole angular momentum. For high enough spin, the black hole triggers the <b>magnetic</b> <b>switch,</b> producing highly-relativistic, kinetic-energy-dominated jets instead of magnetic-energy-dominated ones for lower spin. The coronal mass densities needed to trigger the switch at the observed FR break power are quite small (∼ 10 − 15 g cm − 3), implying that the source of the jet material may be either a pair plasma or very tenuous electron-proton corona, not the main accretion disk itself. The model explains the differences in morphology and Mach number between FR I and II sources and the observed trend for massive galaxies (which contain more massive black holes) to undergo the FR I/II transition at higher radio power. It also is consistent with the energy content of extended radio lobe...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method to}} calculate inductances of <b>magnetic</b> <b>switches,</b> toroidal coils wound on ring-shaped cores of non-linear magnetic material. To check the described theory, measurements {{have been carried out}} on the inductance of <b>magnetic</b> <b>switches</b> in the saturated state. Most text books give expressions for the inductance, but for the critical applications presented here a better approximation is required. Therefore to calculate the inductance of a toroid, the main and three additional types of flux have been taken into account. As a result of this study, a remarkable agreement between the measured and calculated values is found for a large range of turns. For a toroid with a large number of turns the main flux is large compared to the secondary fluxes. For small numbers of turns however, the main flux and the secondary flux contribute equally to the total flux...|$|R
40|$|Repeatable {{magnetization}} reversal under purely {{electrical control}} remains the outstanding goal in magnetoelectrics. Here we use {{magnetic force microscopy}} to study a commercially manufactured multilayer capacitor that displays strain-mediated coupling between magnetostrictive Ni electrodes and piezoelectric BaTiO(3) -based dielectric layers. In an electrode exposed by polishing approximately normal to the layers, we find a perpendicularly magnetized feature that exhibits non-volatile electrically driven repeatable magnetization reversal with no applied magnetic field. Using micromagnetic modelling, we interpret this nominally full magnetization reversal {{in terms of a}} dynamic precession that is triggered by strain from voltage-driven ferroelectric switching that is fast and reversible. The anisotropy field responsible for the perpendicular magnetization is reversed by the electrically driven <b>magnetic</b> <b>switching,</b> which is, therefore, repeatable. Our demonstration of non-volatile <b>magnetic</b> <b>switching</b> via volatile ferroelectric switching may inspire the design of fatigue-free devices for electric-write magnetic-read data storage...|$|R
