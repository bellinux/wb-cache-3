40|$|MOULDED {{leather and}} plastic splints and {{appliances}} are usually prepared {{on a positive}} plaster-of-Paris <b>mould</b> made <b>from</b> <b>a</b> plaster-of-Paris <b>cast</b> of {{the part of the}} body to be splinted. The correct fit of the appliance depends very considerably on the accuracy with which the cast and mould are taken and prepared. It is usual to cast patients for spinal braces in the standing or sitting position with the head supported in an overhead sling. The amount of traction on the head sling depends on the amount of spinal collapse, the amount the patient can support himself, and the amount of traction he can tolerate. The very severely disabled patient with a severe collapsing or fixed scoliosis due, for example, to poliomyelitis or muscular dystrophy is often unable to tolerate the handling and suspension necessary for <b>an</b> adequate <b>cast</b> to be taken. Such severely disabled patients may well be able to control an electrically powered chair if they could have a support manufactured to accept them. Some can be adequately and comfortably supported by adjustable lateral pads (Nichols, 1966), and others can be made comfortable by specially designed cushions. Bu...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the details of}} an optimum nickel electroforming process for MEMS applications. Electrochemical deposition of nickel microstructures in thick resist <b>moulds</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> standard process using a sulphamate electrlyte gives {{most of the time}} poor quality deposits: non uniform, sometimes with pitting and without adherence on the substrate. As in MEMS devices the features to be electroplated are of micron size (which creates a big disproportion in the surface area between the two electrodes involved in the plating bath), an optimisation of the standard electroplating rocess was developed...|$|R
50|$|Less than 30 {{bodies were}} made in total {{including}} a few illegitimate copies <b>moulded</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> existing car - these can normally be identified by not having the proper de Joux GT dashboard. Issues with customers not building their cars properly were among the reasons that Ferris eventually decided {{to move away from}} the GT completely. Many owners took shortcuts when having their chassis made - not understanding that they had been very carefully designed. Twenty-two of the original cars remained on the de Joux register in 2006, one of which was in Australia.|$|R
50|$|Sahni was {{interested}} in music and could play the sitar and the violin. He was also interested in clay-modelling and in playing chess and tennis. At Oxford he used to play tennis for the Indian majlis. Other interests included geology, archaeology and numismatics. In 1936 he examined some coins and <b>moulds</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> dig in Khokra Kot and wrote on the possible methods involved in the casting of the coins. The collection {{is now at the}} National Museum at New Delhi. He was much liked by his nieces and nephews who called him tamashewala uncle for entertaining them with a monkey-hand-puppet named Gippy.|$|R

40|$|During {{analysis}} of the National Museum of Scotland’s collections, one of us (AH) discovered a previously unrecognised mould {{for the production of}} a ‘Pictish’ penannular brooch. The context of the <b>mould,</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> undefended and isolated low-status settlement site, at Cnoc a’ Comhdhalach, North Uist (Western Isles),is unusual for an object of this type. However, recent research on similar sites in the Western Isles suggests that the organisation, control and social context of high-status metalworking in this area differs from that in the better-known areas of western Britain and Ireland, where the production of elaborate brooches is associated with high-status, often royal, sites. This note describes the new material and explores the implications of the finds...|$|R
