40|$|Abstract. The ever-growing malware {{threat in}} the cyber space calls for tech-niques that are more {{effective}} than widely deployed signature-based detection systems and more scalable than <b>manual</b> <b>reverse</b> engineering by forensic experts. To counter large volumes of malware variants, machine learning techniques have been applied recently for automated malware classification. Despite the successes made from these efforts, we still lack {{a basic understanding of}} some key issues, such as what features we should use and which classifiers perform well on mal-ware data. Against this backdrop, the goal of this work is to explore discrim-inatory features for automated malware classification. We conduct a systematic study on the discriminative power of various types of features extracted from mal-ware programs, and experiment with different combinations of feature selection algorithms and classifiers. Our results not only offer insights into what features most distinguish malware families, but also shed light on how to develop scalable techniques for automated malware classification in practice. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Application vetting at app {{stores and}} mar-ket places {{is the first}} line of defense to protect mobile {{end-users}} from malware, spyware, and immoderately curious apps. However, the lack of a highly precise yet large-scaling static analysis has forced market operators to resort to less reliable and only small-scaling dynamic or even manual analysis techniques. In this paper, we present Bati, an analysis frame-work specifically tailored to perform highly precise static analysis of Android apps. Building on estab-lished static analysis frameworks for Java, we solve two important challenges to reach this goal: First, we extend this ground work with an Android application lifecycle model that includes the asynchronous com-munication of multi-threading. Second, we introduce a novel value analysis algorithm that builds on control-flow ordered backwards slicing and techniques from partial and symbolic evaluation. As a result, Bati is the first context-, flow-, object-, and path-sensitive analysis framework for Android apps and improves the status-quo for static analysis on Android. In particular, we em-pirically demonstrate the benefits of Bati in dissecting Android malware by statically detecting behavior that previously required <b>manual</b> <b>reverse</b> engineering. Notice-ably, in contrast to the common conjecture about path-sensitive analyses, our evaluation of 19, 700 apps from Google Play shows that highly precise path-sensitive value analysis of Android apps is possible in a reason-able amount of time and is hence amenable for large-scale vetting processes.

40|$|Protocol reverse {{engineering}} {{is the process}} of extracting application-level specifications for network protocols. Such specifications are very helpful in a number of security-related contexts. For example, they are needed by intrusion detection systems to perform deep packet inspection, and they allow the implementation of black-box fuzzing tools. Unfortunately, <b>manual</b> <b>reverse</b> engineering is a time-consuming and tedious task. To address this problem, researchers have recently proposed systems that help to automate the process. These systems operate by analyzing traces of network traffic. However, there is limited information available at the network-level, and thus, the accuracy of the results is limited. In this paper, we present a novel approach to automatic protocol {{reverse engineering}}. Our approach works by dynamically monitoring the execution of the application, analyzing how the program is processing the protocol messages that it receives. This is motivated by the insight that an application encodes the complete protocol and represents the authoritative specification of the inputs that it can accept. In a first step, we extract information about the fields of individual messages. Then, we aggregate this information to determine a more general specification of the message format, which can include optional or alternative fields, and repetitions. We have applied our techniques to a number of real-world protocols and server applications. Our results demonstrate that we are able to extract the format specification for different types of messages. Using these specifications, we then automatically generate appropriate parser code. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{computer-aided}} design (CAD) of various products, machines and details, virtual movie heroes and video game characters {{is a computer}} science area with significant practical implications and challenging open scientific problems. One of these open problems is the automatic generation of 3 D geometric designs of existing physical objects, a process widely known as <b>reverse</b> engineering. The <b>manual</b> <b>reverse</b> engineering of a geometric design typically incurs costs comparable to engineering a completely new design from scratch. Therefore, the CAD industry is very interested in algorithmic solutions which generate such designs automatically or with a minimal user guidance. In this thesis we describe a set of techniques which combined deliver a solution for reverse engineering physical objects, which surface geometry is represented by dense triangle meshes. We contribute several novel algorithms and new research results in the following geometry processing areas: polygonal mesh simplification, anisotropic and quad-dominant remeshing, scattered data approximation, multiresolution mesh editing. The output of our system is a piecewise smooth Catmull-Clark subdivision surface representing the original object. Its control mesh provides the available degrees of freedom to manipulate and edit {{the shape of the}} represented object. Since our algorithms are designed to produce high quality control meshes, aligned to the structure and the features of the input shape, the output surface representation can be used in various mainstream computer graphics applications such as CAD systems, computer-simulated physical processes and animations (movies and games) ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSwizzor is a malware {{family that}} was first {{seen on the}} Internet in 2002 and, since then, {{researchers}} have collected millions of different binary samples. The reason so many different files exist is that Swizzor uses strong server-side binary obfuscation to evade antivirus detection and slow down <b>manual</b> <b>reverse</b> engineering. In this talk, we will present a set of tools and techniques we have developed to understand and defeat Swizzor's binary protection. Upon execution, the custom packer goes through more than 40 million instructions before reaching any useful code. To deal with this, we created a tracing framework which builds a comprehensive timeline of the process execution, including memory modifications. We also created visualisation tools to quickly identify key elements of the unpacking process without having to read any assembly instruction. We have built an inference engine to automatically identify known patterns in memory such as decryption keys, useless values and control structures used by the packer. By {{taking into account the}} memory access and modification of the code, we were able to bypass its traditional syntactic obfuscation. We thus achieved a comprehensive understanding of the unpacking process and were able to reduce the need for manual analysis of new binaries. To the best of our knowledge, no one has deeply investigated the Swizzor malware family and its ties to shady advertisement companies. We will explain how Swizzor and its adware components are installed by affiliation programs to finance the development of well known applications.

40|$|Botnets {{are one of}} {{the most}} serious threats to Internet {{security}} today. Modern botnets have complex infrastructures consisting of multiple components, which can be dynamically installed, updated, and removed at any time during the botnet operation. Tracking botnets is essential for understanding the current threat landscape. However, state- of-the-art analysis approaches have several limitations. Many malware analysis systems like sandboxes have a very limited analysis time-out, and thus only allow limited insights into the long-time behavior of a botnet. In contrast, customized tracking systems are botnet-specific and need to be adopted to each malware family, which requires tedious <b>manual</b> <b>reverse</b> engineering. In this paper, we present BotWatcher, a novel approach for transparent and generic botnet tracking. To this end, we leverage dynamic analysis and memory forensics techniques to execute the initial malware sample and later installed modules in a controlled environment and regularly obtain insights into the state of the analysis system. The key idea behind BotWatcher is that by reasoning about the evolution of system state over time, we can reconstruct a high-level overview of the botnet lifecycle, i. e., the sequence of botnet actions that caused this evolution. Our approach is generic since it relies neither on previous knowledge of the botnet nor on OS-specific features. Transparency is achieved by performing outside-OS monitoring and not installing any analysis tools in the analysis environment. We implemented BotWatcher for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X (both 32 - and 64 -bit architectures), and applied it to monitor four botnets targeting Microsoft Windows. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a generic, transparent, and fully automated botnet tracking system...|$|R
40|$|Detecting the {{presence}} of buffer overflow attacks in network messages {{has been a major}} focus of the security community. Only knowing whether a message contains an attack, however, is not always enough to mitigate the threat. Sometimes it is also critical to know what the attack does. Some attacks will open up backdoors on the victim hosts, while others may download a secondary malware payload from a rogue web server. Understanding the exploit behavior can be very helpful in determining the proper response. Unfortunately, shell code from buffer overflow attacks is written in low-level assembly language, and is often obfuscated with encoding routines. The current method of analyzing shell code, <b>manual</b> <b>reverse</b> engineering, can be time-consuming and requires significant expertise. Furthermore, new analysis must be done for each unique payload, which makes manual analysis nearly impossible for large wide-scale polymorphic attacks. In response to the need for automated attack payload analysis, we introduce Spector. Spector uses symbolic execution to extract meaningful high-level application programming interface (API) calls from shell code. This information exposes the code’s real functionality and can aid in attack mitigation. Spector’s high-level output also helps facilitate classification of different attack payloads that have the same behavior. To evaluate Spector, we tested it with over 23, 000 unique payloads gathered from lightweight honeypot deployments. It identified eleven different classes of shell code, and was able to process all the payloads in just over three hours. Spector was also able to successfully classify polymorphic instances of the same shell code that were generated using two polymorphism tools. In this paper, we present the architecture and implementation of Spector, as well as our experience using it to analyze real attack payloads. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: In recent years, new neurocognitive {{explanatory}} approaches such as dual-process theories offer {{significant progress}} in understanding long-term relapse in substance use disorders. Based on such explanatory concepts stemming from basic research, novel methods of intervention have been deduced which focus on directly changing cognitive biases. The efficacy of these Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) concepts has been evaluated in {{a growing number of}} studies in the context of different substance use and addictive disorders. By now, there are also first findings for using CBM in the context of smoking. Objectives: To evaluate the empirical evidence, whether CBM qualifies i)  for reducing attentional or approach bias towards smoking-related cues, ii)  for effectively reducing the high relapse rates in smoking cessation, iii)  for the reduction of smoking behaviour and iv)  craving. Methods: The systematic evidence search has been carried out in clinical databases (Cochrane Library, PsycArticles, PSYNDEX, PsycINFO, Medline) as well as via <b>manual</b> <b>reverse</b> search. Finally, 12  studies have been identified which met the inclusion criteria (RCT, CBM interventions for smokers; outcomes: change in attentional or approach bias, craving, number of cigarettes smoked, abstinence). Results: Despite the heterogeneity of the studies in terms of sample selection, realisation of interventions and methodological aspects, the findings collectively indicate that different forms and 'dosages' of CBM interventions can influence attentional or approach bias in smokers. Also, positive effects on craving and motivation to quit could be detected. Effects on smoking behaviour are inconsistent and often statistically non-significant. First online applications showed encouraging results. Discussion: The results concerning the efficacy of CBM in smoking cessation are still rudimentary and inconsistent. However, {{a large portion of the}} studies was not conducted under naturalistic conditions, but rather in laboratories with non-treatment seekers or participants partially motivated to quit. Despite these limitations, the findings can be evaluated as encouraging. The results suggest that CBM will be implemented in routine care as an adjunct intervention within a behavioural therapy-oriented cessation programme. However, specific studies which assess the efficacy of CBM as a component for relapse prevention in smoking cessation intervention in routine care are still lacking...|$|R

40|$|Physical and {{imagined}} movements show similar behavioral constraints and neurophysiological activation patterns. An inhibition mechanism {{is thought to}} suppress overt movement during m otor imagery, {{but it does not}} effectively suppress autonomic or postural adjustments. Inhibitory processes and postural stability both deteriorate with age. Thus, older people’s balance is potentially vulnerable to interference from postural adjustments in duced by thoughts about past or future actions. Here, young and older adults stood upright and executed or imagined manual reaching movements. Reported arm movement time (MT) of all participants increased with target distance. Older participants reported longer MT than young participants when executing arm movements, but not when imagining them. Older adults’ anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) postural sway was higher than young adults’ at baseline, but their AP sway fell below their baseline level during manual imagery. In contrast, young adults’ AP sway increased during imagery relative to their baseline. A similar tendency to reduce sway in the ML direction was also observed in older adults during imagery in a challenging stance. These results suggest that postural response during <b>manual</b> motor imagery <b>reverses</b> direction with age. Motor imagery and action planning are ubiquitous tasks, and older people are likely to spend more time engaged in them.

Complex meshes without native parameterization have to be "flatten" or "unwrapped" in the (u,v) parameter space, with the main objective to be mapped with a single image. This result can be obtained by using two different strategies: the former automatic and faster, while the latter <b>manual</b> and time-consuming. <b>Reverse</b> modelling applications provide automatic solutions based on splitting the models by means of different algorithms, that produce a sort of "atlas" of the original model in the parameter space, in many instances not adequate and negatively affecting the overall quality of representation. Using in synergy different solutions, ranging from semantic aware modelling techniques to quad-dominant meshes achieved using retopology tools, it is possible to obtain a complete control of the parameterization process...|$|R
