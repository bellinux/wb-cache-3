5|$|Skirmishes with Edward over {{clerical}} privileges, royal power, Peckham's use of excommunication, and ecclesiastical taxation continued, but in October 1286, Edward {{issued a}} writ entitled Circumspecte Agatis which specified {{what types of}} cases the ecclesiastical courts could hear. These included <b>moral</b> <b>issues,</b> matrimonial issues, disputes about wills and testaments, the correction of sins, and slander and physical attacks on the clergy.|$|E
5|$|Each sermon {{begins with}} a scriptural passage that {{reinforces}} the ideas that {{will be discussed in}} the sermon and each was preceded with the same opening prayer (which Swift also delivered). The sermons are plainly written and apply a common-sense approach to contemporary <b>moral</b> <b>issues</b> in Dublin. Swift patterned his sermons on the plain style of the Book of Common Prayer and the Church of Ireland Authorized Version of the Bible.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Sadler began giving {{lectures on}} the Chautauqua adult-education circuit, which {{featured}} itinerant speakers discussing self-help and morality. Sadler often spoke about attaining {{physical and mental}} health without drugs. He also promoted hydrotherapy and discussed <b>moral</b> <b>issues</b> that related to men. Sadler, his wife, her sister, and a friend, formed a four-member lecture company that gave two- or three-day engagements, sometimes accompanied by an orchestra. Newspapers published favorable reviews of the productions. The lectures proved to be a lucrative endeavor: it was rumored that {{he became one of the}} best-paid Chautauqua speakers.|$|E

5|$|The {{conflict}} between Old School and New School factions {{merged with the}} slavery controversy. The New School's enthusiasm for moral reform and voluntary societies was evident in its increasing identification with the abolitionist movement. The Old School, however, {{was convinced that the}} General Assembly and the larger church should not legislate on <b>moral</b> <b>issues</b> that were not explicitly addressed in the Bible. This effectively drove the majority of Southern Presbyterians to support the Old School faction.|$|E
5|$|An {{outgrowth}} of Jackson's trip was {{the realization that}} the National Park Service does not represent the underlying issue of slavery contextually in its battlefield displays and presentations. Instead of presenting the battles as political and <b>moral</b> <b>issues,</b> Jackson felt racial context and relevance needed to be presented in a more forward way. As a result, in 2000, he recrafted the United States Department of the Interior's appropriation to include a directive to have United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt use his influence over the superintendents of the national parks to encourage greater inclusion of slavery and social issues in Civil War presentations.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, {{the death}} of Emperor Hirohito once again raised <b>moral</b> <b>issues</b> about the {{national}} flag. Conservatives felt that if the flag could be used during the ceremonies without reopening old wounds, they might {{have a chance to}} propose that the Hinomaru become the national flag without being challenged about its meaning. During an official six-day mourning period, flags were flown at half staff or draped in black bunting all across Japan. Despite reports of protesters vandalizing the Hinomaru {{on the day of the}} Emperor's funeral, schools' right to fly the Japanese flag at half-staff without reservations brought success to the conservatives.|$|E

He emphasizes {{that it is difficult to}} determine whether we kill someone when we have abortion, but {{believes that}} in its strictly manipulative aspect abortion is closer to procreation than to refraining from procreation and in his view abortion of healthy fetus is killing a human, and therefore morally unjustifiable.|$|R
5|$|Genesis of the Daleks was {{originally}} commissioned under producer Barry Letts and script editor Terrance Dicks, {{who felt that}} the outline submitted by Nation was too similar to his previous Dalek adventures, and encouraged him to explore {{the origin of the}} Daleks. The story introduces the Daleks' creator Davros (Michael Wisher), who had a unique visual design. The script was handed to Letts and Dicks' successors, producer Philip Hinchcliffe and script editor Robert Holmes, who made changes to the original script which gave it a darker tone. Nation, having intentionally modelled the Daleks on the Nazis, further explored the theme in Genesis. It also addresses the <b>moral</b> <b>issues</b> that come with time travelling and genocide. The story was filmed over January and February 1975, with some location filming in a quarry in Betchworth.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} aiming at finding out, whether the reasons of aversion to organ trade legalization are more a <b>moral</b> <b>issue</b> or the aversion {{is caused by}} people being uninformed or misinformed.

30|$|I {{realize that}} this {{description}} of <b>moral</b> <b>issue</b> is not as well-defined as some philosophers {{would like it to}} be. However, since the interviews and the workshop were explicitly aimed at tracing the opinions of the engineers themselves, I did not give any constraints on what counts as a <b>moral</b> <b>issue</b> nor did I introduce issues that were not mentioned by the engineers themselves.

25|$|In non-Orthodox {{denominations}} of Judaism most rabbis {{hold that}} Jews {{have nothing to}} fear from engaging in theological dialogue, and may have much to gain.

The game was a commercial failure, and although Surreal Software initially spoke {{about the possibility of}} a multi-game series, no further Suffering games were made.|$|E
25|$|According to Tabari, Nebuchadnezzar, whose Persian {{name was}} Bukhtrashah, was of Persian descent, from the progeny of Jūdharz, however modern {{scholars}} are unanimous {{that he was}} either a native Mesopotamian (Assyrian-Babylonian) or a Chaldean. Some medieval writers erroneoulsly believed he lived as long as 300 years.
