5|$|By {{her junior}} year, Rodham became a {{supporter}} of the antiwar presidential nomination campaign of Democrat Eugene McCarthy. In early 1968, she was elected president of the Wellesley College Government Association and served through early 1969. Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Rodham organized a two-day student strike and worked with Wellesley's black students to recruit <b>more</b> <b>black</b> students and faculty. In her student government role, she played a role in keeping Wellesley from being embroiled in the student disruptions common to other colleges. A number of her fellow students thought she might some day become the first female President of the United States.|$|E

5|$|Immature American {{white and}} scarlet ibises are very {{difficult}} to tell apart, although scarlet ibises tend to have darker legs and bare skin around the face. An immature American white ibis could be mistaken for an immature glossy ibis, but the latter is wholly dark brown and lacks the white belly and rump. The adult is distinguishable from the wood stork, which is much larger and its wings have <b>more</b> <b>black</b> on them.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Shepard ran for an at-large {{seat on the}} Philadelphia City Council. By {{the rules}} of the limited voting system for the at-large seats, each {{political}} party could nominate five candidates and voters could only vote for five, with the result being that the majority party could only take five of the seven seats, leaving two for the minority party. Shepard won one of the five Democratic slots and was easily elected. On the council, he served as head of the public works committee. In 1956, charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections were proposed. Shepard initially opposed the change, but later voted in favor after party leaders promised him <b>more</b> <b>black</b> Democrats would get political appointments. The amendments found the required two-thirds vote in Council to make it on to the ballot for popular approval but failed in a vote that April.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} groups of Black Hebrews, the Church of God and Saints of Christ, was founded in Kansas in 1896, but it {{retained}} elements of a messianic connection to Jesus. During the following decades, many <b>more</b> <b>Black</b> Hebrew congregations were established, {{and some of them}} had no connection to Christianity. After World War I, for example, Wentworth Arthur Matthew, an immigrant from Saint Kitts, founded a Black Hebrew congregation in Harlem, claiming descent from the ancient Israelites. He called it the Commandment Keepers of the Living God. Similar groups selected elements of Judaism and adapted them within a structure {{similar to that of the}} Black church. He incorporated it in 1930 and moved the congregation to Brooklyn, where he later founded the Israelite Rabbinical Seminary, where Black Hebrew rabbis have been educated and ordained.|$|E

5|$|The {{color and}} texture of the coyote's fur varies {{somewhat}} geographically. The hair's predominant color is light gray and red or fulvous, interspersed around the body with black and white. Coyotes living at high elevations tend to have <b>more</b> <b>black</b> and gray shades than their desert-dwelling counterparts, which are more fulvous or whitish-gray. The coyote's fur consists of short, soft underfur and long, coarse guard hairs. The fur of northern subspecies is longer and denser than in southern forms, with the fur of some Mexican and Central American forms being almost hispid (bristly). Generally, adult coyotes (including coywolf hybrids) have a sable coat color, dark neonatal coat color, bushy tail with an active supracaudal gland, and a white facial mask. Albinism is extremely rare in coyotes; {{out of a total}} of 750,000 coyotes harvested by federal and cooperative hunters between March22, 1938, and June30, 1945, only two were albinos.|$|E
5|$|Despite Governor Catts' {{change of}} attitude, white mob action {{frequently}} occurred in towns throughout north and central Florida and went unchecked by local law enforcement. Extrajudicial violence against black residents was so common that it seldom {{was covered by}} newspapers. In 1920, whites removed four black men from jail, who were suspects accused of raping a white woman in Macclenny, and lynched them. In Ocoee the same year, two black citizens armed themselves {{to go to the}} polls during an election. A confrontation ensued and two white election officials were shot, after which a white mob destroyed Ocoee's black community, causing as many as 30 deaths, and destroying 25 homes, two churches, and a Masonic Lodge. Just weeks before the Rosewood massacre, the Perry Race Riot occurred on 14 and 15 December 1922, in which whites burned Charles Wright at the stake and attacked the black community of Perry, Florida after a white schoolteacher was murdered. On the day following Wright's lynching, whites shot and hanged two <b>more</b> <b>black</b> men in Perry; next they burned the town's black school, Masonic lodge, church, amusement hall, and several families' homes.|$|E
5|$|Some {{variation}} {{is seen in}} the 12 subspecies of house sparrows, which are divided into two groups, the Oriental P. d. indicus group, and the Palaearctic P. d. domesticus group. Birds of the P. d. domesticus group have grey cheeks, while P. d. indicus group birds have white cheeks, as well as bright colouration on the crown, a smaller bill, and a longer black bib. The subspecies P. d. tingitanus differs little from the nominate subspecies, except in the worn breeding plumage of the male, in which the head is speckled with black and underparts are paler. P. d. balearoibericus is slightly paler than the nominate, but darker than P. d. bibilicus. P. d. bibilicus is paler than most subspecies, but has the grey cheeks of P. d. domesticus group birds. The similar P. d. persicus is paler and smaller, and P. d. niloticus is nearly identical but smaller. Of the less widespread P. d. indicus group subspecies, P. d. hyrcanus is larger than P. d. indicus, P. d. hufufae is paler, P. d. bactrianus is larger and paler, and P. d. parkini is larger and darker with <b>more</b> <b>black</b> on the breast than any other subspecies.|$|E

50|$|From 1965 to 1970, black militant males, {{especially}} {{younger men}} from poverty-stricken areas, {{spoke out against}} birth control as black genocide. The Black Panther Party and the Nation of Islam were the strongest voices. The Black Panther Party {{identified a number of}} injustices as contributing to black genocide, including social ills that were <b>more</b> serious in <b>black</b> populations, such as drug abuse, prostitution and sexually transmitted disease. Other injustices included unsafe housing, malnutrition and the over-representation of young black men {{on the front lines of}} the Vietnam War. Influential black activists such as singer/author Julius Lester and comedian Dick Gregory said that blacks should increase in population and avoid genocidal family planning measures. H. Rap Brown of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) held that black genocide consisted of four elements: <b>more</b> <b>blacks</b> executed than whites, malnutrition in impoverished areas affected <b>blacks</b> <b>more</b> than whites, the Vietnam War killed <b>more</b> <b>blacks</b> than whites, and birth control programs in black neighborhoods were trying to end the black race. A birth control clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, was torched by black militants who said it contributed to black genocide.|$|R

25|$|Typically, {{the alpha}} female dominates all other {{individuals}} of a colony, laying {{the majority of}} eggs and partaking in differential oophagy. The alpha female devotes {{much of her time}} to social interaction, in comparison to subordinates that are much more involved in foraging and brood care. The clypeus, the yellow region above the mouth, is extremely variable in number, size, and shape of black spots, and this variation correlates to dominance; more dominant individuals have <b>more</b> <b>black</b> spots. The arrival at the nest correlates with the dominance hierarchy. Therefore, individuals that join the nest later are seldom dominant.|$|E

These pale forms helice can be confused with Berger's clouded yellow (Colias sareptensis) and the rarer Pale clouded yellow (Colias hyale).

The problem of union corruption was growing in public awareness, and CIO's industrial unions were less vulnerable to penetration by criminal elements than were the AFL's trucking, longshoring, building, and entertainment unions.

The southwest Arabian race P. p. asirensis differs in having <b>more</b> <b>black</b> in the plumage with a narrower white scapular patch, no white rump, and smaller white areas on the primaries.
