At the same time that he was choreographing The Band Wagon he was staging dances for Cole Porter’s Broadway musical Can-Can.

Donald Allured, {{founding director of}} Westminster Concert Bell Choir, is credited with fully realizing an American off-the-table style of ringing that includes many non-ringing sound effects including stopped techniques such as plucking the clapper with the bell on the table. He is also credited for promoting precise damping or stopping of the sound by touching the bell to a soft surface, {{in the service of}} more musical results.|$|E

25|$|After a solid {{start on}} a rain-shortened first day, {{when they reached}} 152/2, England fell away on the second. Only 55 from Allen enabled them to make as many as 295 {{in the face of}} Hall's fast bowling. Alexander took four catches. Though West Indies {{achieved}} a substantial first innings lead, thanks largely to Sobers, they scored at not <b>much</b> <b>over</b> two runs an over. Between them, the two English off-spinners, Allen and Illingworth, bowled 85 overs for only 147 runs. Thanks to centuries by Dexter and Subba Row (his first in Tests), England had no difficulty in saving the game, reaching 320/3 at one point before there was a flurry of wickets when {{it was too late to}} matter.|$|E
25|$|The town {{is located}} on the Neva Lowland, on the left bank of the river Neva, in the valley of the Slavyanka River. The {{landscape}} is quite varied and contains hills, ridges and terraces intermixed with valleys, plains, forests and farmland. Numerous springs give rise to streams and feed ponds. In the Paleozoic era, 300–400 million years ago, the area was covered by a sea. Sediments of that time form a layer thicker than 200 meters on top of the Baltic Shield consisting of granite, gneiss and diabase. The modern topography was shaped by the glacier retreat some 12,000 years ago which created the Littorina Sea. About 4,000 years ago the sea receded and formed the valley of the Neva River which has not changed <b>much</b> <b>over</b> the last 2,500 years.|$|E

Not {{expected}} to improve <b>much</b> <b>over</b> 2004, they surprisingly won their first conference game against Marshall, 23–13, ending the school's 17-game losing streak, then the nation's longest such streak. UCF fans celebrated by storming the field and tearing down the goal posts. Students came back to the campus and celebrated further by jumping into UCF's Reflection Pond (a practice normally reserved for Spirit Splash). UCF then went on to win eight out of the remaining nine games on their schedule, finishing 7–1 in C-USA games and 8–5 overall, winning the East Division and hosting the first ever C-USA Championship game, which they lost, 44-27, to Tulsa. Shortly thereafter, UCF was invited to play in their first ever bowl game, the Hawaii Bowl, losing to Nevada 49-48 in overtime due to a missed PAT that would have tied the game. In 2005 O'Leary was chosen by SportsIllustrated.com for the coach of the year award and received votes for the larger Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award award. In May 2006, UCF extended O'Leary's contract for 10 years and increased his pay to $1 million plus incentives per year after he engineered the fourth-best single-season turnaround in college football history.|$|E
