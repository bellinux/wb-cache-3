5|$|In the 20th century, Llantwit {{developed}} into a dormitory town and grew about 15 times in size to accommodate the Royal Air Force at St Athan. Despite its <b>modernization</b> <b>and</b> rapid growth, it retains its pre-modern feel with its narrow winding streets, high walls, old town hall and gatehouse, and several inns and houses dated to the 16th century. Llantwit Major railway station on the Vale of Glamorgan Line was reopened in June 2005. In 2014, it was rated {{one of the most}} attractive postcode areas to live in Wales.|$|E
5|$|On 29 July 2013, Army Chief of Staff General Ray Odierno {{warned that}} the Ground Combat Vehicle program might be delayed or {{possibly}} even cancelled because of the sequestration budget cuts. Although he specifically said it could be delayed, he did {{not rule out the}} possibility of cancellation. The GCV was high-priority for the Army to give better protection than the M2 Bradley, but because of the sequester cuts everything was being considered. On 1 August 2013, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel outlined two basic results if the effects of sequestration continued: modernization programs like the GCV would be cut to maintain troop levels, or high-end capability efforts like the GCV would be preserved to continue <b>modernization</b> <b>and</b> keep equipment technologically advanced with troop levels being cut. Odierno was committed to balancing soldiers, readiness, and <b>modernization,</b> <b>and</b> was intent on the need for the Ground Combat Vehicle. Suggested alternative options, such as further upgrading the Bradley and buying currently available infantry fighting vehicles like the German Puma, were recommended as cost-saving measures. Army leaders said the Puma's low troop-carrying capacity would require buying five vehicles to replace every four Bradleys, and that upgrading the Bradley would essentially be engineering a new vehicle. While these options would offer no improvement over the fleet's current capability, not pursuing the GCV would allow the money to be spent elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|One {{topic of}} {{particular}} importance to Pierce was the military. He challenged a bill which would expand {{the ranks of the}} Army's staff officers in Washington without any apparent benefit to line officers at posts {{in the rest of the}} country. He took an interest in military pensions, seeing abundant fraud within the system, and was named chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Pensions in the Twenty-sixth Congress (1839–1841). In that capacity, he urged the <b>modernization</b> <b>and</b> expansion of the Army, with a focus on militias and mobility rather than on coastal fortifications, which he considered outdated.|$|E
5|$|The rise {{of cargo}} {{containerization}} in the 1960s helped offset declining traffic to the Port of Seattle, {{leading to a}} $80 million <b>modernization</b> <b>and</b> expansion program begun in 1968. The Port of Tacoma debuted its own cargo container-ready facilities in 1970, and gradually lured away several large shipping lines from Seattle through the 1990s, including Alaska-based Totem Ocean Trailer Express (1976), SeaLand (1983), Maersk (1985), K Line (1988), and Evergreen Marine (1991). The Port of Seattle's largest line, Hyundai Merchant Marine, moved to a new, $65 million terminal in Tacoma in 1996.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, the French army {{ceased to}} use the Mérens for drawing {{artillery}} in the mountains, and this corresponded {{to the beginning of}} the decline of the breed. The population fell dramatically during the second half of the 20th century, due to the <b>modernization</b> <b>and</b> mechanization of transport and agriculture. In 1950 in Senegal, the Mérens was used in attempts to create a horse tougher than the native M'Bayar, but the breeding program was not enough to significantly increase the Mérens population. The use of the Mérens in agriculture continued into the 1970s, and like many French draft breeds, it was also bred for slaughter to produce horse meat. The mountains of Ariege acted as a sanctuary, preventing the Mérens, as well as other breeds such as Gascon cattle and Tarasconnaise sheep, from disappearing completely. By the early 1970s, however, the Mérens was on the verge of extinction.|$|E

5|$|In January 2014, the Benadir {{administration}} {{launched a}} citywide street naming, house numbering and postal codes project. Officially called the House Numbering and Post Code System, it {{is a joint}} initiative of the municipal authorities and Somali business community representatives. The project {{is part of the}} ongoing <b>modernization</b> <b>and</b> development of the capital. According to former Mayor Mohamed Ahmed Nur, the initiative also aims to help the authorities firm up on security and resolve housing ownership disputes. In March 2015, the Benadir administration likewise launched a renovation project on the Hawo Asir-Fagah major road in Mogadishu. The government-public partnership aims to facilitate vehicle access in the area. According to Karaan district commissioner Ahmed Hassan Yalah'ow, the reconstruction initiative will also make the road all-weather resistant and is slated to be completed shortly.|$|E
5|$|Lefebvre was {{increasingly}} criticized by influential {{members of his}} large religious congregation who considered him to be out-of-step with modern Church leaders and the demand of the bishops' conferences, particularly in France, for <b>modernization</b> <b>and</b> reforms. An Extraordinary General Chapter of the Holy Ghost Fathers was convened in Rome in September 1968 to debate {{the direction of the}} congregation after the changes of the Second Vatican Council. The first action of the chapter was to name several moderators to lead the chapter's sessions instead of Lefebvre. Lefebvre then handed in his resignation as Superior General to Pope Paul VI. He would later say that it had become impossible for him to remain superior of an institute that no longer wanted or listened to him.|$|E
5|$|PedroII {{began his}} rule as a figurehead who held {{together}} a realm {{on the verge}} of disintegration. He quickly matured and successfully navigated the empire through repeated and serious crises. By the time of Afonso's death, the nation was entering an unprecedented era of prosperity, development and tranquility. Even as the emperor's political successes and policies began to bear fruit, the lack of a male heir caused him to lose motivation to promote the imperial office as a position to be carried on by his descendants. The emperor turned away from personal and family ties, and focused on upholding the constitution while directing Brazil toward policies that furthered <b>modernization</b> <b>and</b> social advancement. The future of the monarchy as an institution no longer mattered to him, and in 1889, he was deposed in a coup, marking the end of the Empire of Brazil.|$|E

5|$|Unable to {{construct}} new capital ships until 1931, Japan resorted to upgrading battleships and battlecruisers. In July 1926, Haruna {{became the first}} of Japan's vessels to undergo extensive <b>modernization</b> <b>and</b> modification, in drydock at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal. Over the next two years, her horizontal armor near her ammunition magazines was strengthened, and the machinery spaces within the hull were increased. Anti-torpedo bulges were added along the waterline, as permitted by the Washington Treaty. She was refitted to accommodate three Type90 Model0 floatplanes. To increase her speed and power capacities, all 36 Yarrow boilers were removed and replaced with 16 newer boilers, and Brown-Curtis direct-drive turbines were installed. Harunas forward funnel was removed, and her second funnel was enlarged and lengthened. The modifications to her hull increased her armor weight from 6,502 to 10,313long tons, directly violating {{the terms of the}} Washington Treaty. In July 1928, Haruna—now capable of speeds of —was reclassified as a battleship.|$|E
