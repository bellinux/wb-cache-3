Nevertheless, the ductility of dual-phase high carbon steel can be questioned owing to the carbon percentage and brittleness of their <b>martensitic</b> <b>structures.</b> Fortunately, it is possible to achieve a good balance of high-energy absorption properties and strength in high carbon steel through alloying as well as well-controlled microstructures...|$|R

50|$|Before hardening, cast steels {{and iron}} {{are of a}} uniform and lammelar (or layered) {{pearlitic}} grain structure. This {{is a mixture of}} ferrite and cementite formed when steel or cast iron are manufactured and cooled at a slow rate. Pearlite is not an ideal material for many common applications of steel alloys as it is quite soft. By heating pearlite past its eutectoid transition temperature of 727 °C and then rapidly cooling, some of the material’s crystal structure can be transformed into a much harder structure known as martensite. Steels with this <b>martensitic</b> <b>structure</b> are often used in applications when the workpiece must be highly resistant to deformation, such as the cutting edge of blades.|$|E
50|$|Induction heating is a non contact {{heating process}} which utilises the {{principle}} of electromagnetic induction to produce heat inside the surface layer of a work-piece. By placing a conductive material into a strong alternating magnetic field, electric current {{can be made to}} flow in the material thereby creating heat due to the I2R losses in the material. In magnetic materials, further heat is generated below the curie point due to hysteresis losses. The current generated flows predominantly in the surface layer, the depth of this layer being dictated by the frequency of the alternating field, the surface power density, the permeability of the material, the heat time and the diameter of the bar or material thickness. By quenching this heated layer in water, oil, or a polymer based quench, the surface layer is altered to form a <b>martensitic</b> <b>structure</b> which is harder than the base metal.|$|E
50|$|Many metals {{have several}} {{different}} crystal structures {{at the same}} composition, but most metals do not show this shape-memory effect. The special property that allows shape-memory alloys to revert to their original shape after heating is that their crystal transformation is fully reversible. In most crystal transformations, the atoms in the structure will travel through the metal by diffusion, changing the composition locally, even though the metal {{as a whole is}} made of the same atoms. A reversible transformation does not involve this diffusion of atoms, instead all the atoms shift {{at the same time to}} form a new structure, much in the way a parallelogram can be made out of a square by pushing on two opposing sides. At different temperatures, different structures are preferred and when the structure is cooled through the transition temperature, the <b>martensitic</b> <b>structure</b> forms from the austenitic phase.|$|E

This different behavior has been explained in terms of a model recently reported. We have also proved that the entropy change at the martensitic transition is independent of the state of atomic order of the crystal, as predicted theoretically.

The heat treated samples were characterized through the evolving microstructure and hardness. It was found that there was a significant grain size reduction in both the heat treated stainless steel specimens compared to the parent materials.

40|$|Abstract. The Ni-Mn-Ga L 2, ordered alloys {{undergo a}} {{martensitic}} transformation (MT) which characteristics have been extensively analysed {{in relation to}} the electron to atom ratio (e/a). In that sense, alloys with ela 7. 70 do not undergo any premartensitic transformation but they show instead a first order intermartensitic transformation during cooling. Alloys with intermediate ela do not show such defined behaviours, but they are highly sensitive to the external applied fields. In the present work, three single crystalline Ni-Mn-Ga alloys with ela between 7. 60 and 7. 70 are studied. The obtained results indicate that, even though the transformation temperatures are quite similar and the <b>martensitic</b> <b>structures</b> are in all cases modulated crystal lattices of 5 or 7 layer period, the transformation behaviour is different for each alloy, as revealed by the DSC and, especially, by the internal friction (IF) and modulus (E) evolution during cooling and heating these alloys.

40|$|The {{influence}} of martensitic microstructure and prior austenite grain (PAG) size on the mechanical properties of novel maraging steel was studied. This {{was achieved by}} looking at two different <b>martensitic</b> <b>structures</b> with PAG sizes of approximately 40 µm and 80 µm, produced by hot rolling to different reductions. Two ageing heat-treatments were considered: both heat-treatments consisted of austenisation at 960 °C, then aging at 560 °C for 5 h, but while one was rapidly cooled the other was slow cooled and then extended aged at 480 °C for 64 h. It is shown that for the shorter ageing treatment the smaller PAG size resulted in significant improvements in strength (increase of more than 150 MPa), ductility (four times increase), creep life (almost four times increase in creep life) and fatigue life (almost doubled). Whereas, the extended aged sample showed similar changes in the fatigue life, elongation and hardness it displayed yet showed no difference in tensile strength and creep.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the present}} paper was to study the peculiarities of the {{austenite}} to martensite phase transformation (A-M), which is an essential step in the production technology of the high strength metastable stainless steels. Design/methodology/approach: The desired control over A-M transformation have been achieved by proper design of the steel chemistry, cold working and heat treatment.

The results showed that friction stir processed NAB alloy microhardness was increased as the rotation rate increased.
