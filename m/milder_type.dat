40|$|Background/Aim. Endometriosis befalls {{in one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} gynecologic diseases. It manifests itself by the presence and growth of focus of endometrium out of the uterus cavum that reacts to hormonal stimulations as the normal uterus endometrium does. Hyperstimulation and induction of ovulation together with intrauterine insemination (IUI) are the most frequently used treatments of unexplained infertility in patients with <b>mild</b> <b>type</b> endometriosis. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of stimulation using human menopausal gonadotrophine (hMG) in the patients with <b>mild</b> <b>type</b> endometriosis to the patients with infertility of unknown ethiology. Methods. The study included 50 patients with unexplained infertility (group N), as well as 50 patients with <b>mild</b> <b>type</b> endometriosis (group E) confirmed by laparoscopy. Within the same therapeutic protocole hMG stimulation and horionic gonadotrophine induction (hCG) were used. Results. In the group E ovulation occurred in 74 % of the patients during the first stimulation, in 77. 78 % during the second cycle, and in 75 % of the patients during the third one. Regarding the group N, ovulation appeared in 82 % of the patients during the first stimulation. Stimulation was performed two times more in 38 patients with unknown couse of infertility, and ovulation appeared in 84. 21 % of them. In the group N stimulation was performed three times in 28 women resulting in ovulation in 85. 71 % of them. Conclusion. Considering the obtained results it can be concluded that hMG stimulation and hCG induction are efficient in the treatment of infertility, particularly in <b>mild</b> <b>type</b> endometriosis...|$|R

40|$|Background Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} (CVST) is {{a special}} type of cerebrovascular disease with high morbidity and mortality which often has an unpredictable outcome. It is usually misdiagnosed because of different causes and variable clinical manifestations. How to improve the diagnosis and therapy of CVST is always the hotspot in clinic. This article aims to investigate the effective and safe strategies in the treatment for CVST. Methods Clinical data of 52 patients diagnosed with CVST were retrospectively analyzed. These patients were subdivided into <b>mild</b> <b>type</b> and severe type according to the features of symptoms, signs, lumbar puncture pressure and imaging. The patients with <b>mild</b> <b>type</b> were treated with systemic anticoagulant therapy combined with intravenous thrombolysis [continuous intravenous infusion of heparin (12. 50 - 25) × 103 U/d for 7 - 10 d followed by a continuous infusion of urokinase (0. 50 - 0. 75) × 106 U/d for 5 - 7 d]. The patients with severe type were treated with endovascular thrombolysis [injection of urokinase (0. 50 - 1) × 106 U, 0. 10 × 106 U/min via carotid or vertebral artery; or intravenous infusion of urokinase 1 × 106 U/d and heparin 25 × 103 U/d for 5 - 7 d], and superior sagittal sinus cut-open/ intrasinus thrombolysis separately. All the patients took oral warfarin for 6 - 12 months, and follow-up was performed after operation by the method of magnetic resonance venography (MRV). Results Among the 27 cases of <b>mild</b> <b>type</b> receiving systemic anticoagulant agents and intravenous thrombolysis, 14 were cured; 9 were improved; 4 were ineffective. Among the 22 cases of severe type receiving systemic anticoagulant drugs and endovascular thrombolysis, 18 were cured; 3 were improved; 1 was dead. The left 3 cases with gravis type received superior sagittal sinus cut-open/intrasinus thrombolysis and were cured.

40|$|SUMMARY A {{family with}} Becker type muscular {{dystrophy}} is described, {{in which two}} females were severely affected, giving the family tree the appearance of dominant inheritance. Becker muscular dystrophy is clinically similar to the Duchenne type (Zundel and Tyler, 1965) but charac-terised by a later age of onset, slower progression, and in general by a much <b>milder</b> <b>type</b> of muscular dystrophy. Inheritance in both types is X-linked recessive and though many heterozygous females of the Duchenne type have been reported as variably affected (Moser and Emery, 1974), {{this is not so}} for carriers of the Becker variety. The present report describes a family in which two females have severe manifestations of the disease. Case report The propositus was a 31 -year-old male lawyer. Th...|$|E
40|$|Leprechaunism {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} recessive disorder associated with extreme insulin resistance with paradoxical hypo-glycaemia. It is characterised by prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, reduced subcutaneous tissue, coarse features, acanthosis nigricans, enlarged genitalia, and death {{in the first year}} of life. Defects in both the insulin receptor and postreceptor steps of the insulin action pathway have been reported. At the molecular level, several mutations have been described. The patients reported here are from a Yemeni family with a syndrome of insulin resistance similar to leprechaunism in which the parents are second cousins and five of their eight children are affected. However, the phenotypes seem to be less severe than the classical leprechaunism previously described. All the children are alive (oldest 11 years), there is normal subcutaneous tissue, and a normal growth pattern in some of them. It may be that this is a <b>milder</b> <b>type</b> of leprechaunism with a better prognosis, perhaps caused by a different type of mutation from those previously described...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To assess visual outcome, funduscopic appearance, and {{refraction}} {{for infants}} treated with cryotherapy for threshold {{retinopathy of prematurity}} (ROP) between 1989 and 1999. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the medical records of premature infants with threshold ROP who were treated with cryotherapy. RESULTS: A total of 2, 146 premature infants were screened for ROP during the study period. Of the 66 infants who were subsequently treated for threshold ROP with cryotherapy, 58 infants had at least 1 year of follow-up and comprised the study population. After correcting for improved survival, the overall incidence of treated infants with cryotherapy increased during the study period. Comparison of infants treated from 1989 through 1995 (group 1; n= 26) and 1996 through 1999 (group 2; n= 32) showed group 2 infants had improved visual outcome, better funduscopic anatomic appearance, and decreased myopia. CONCLUSION: Although the incidence of treated premature infants increased during the study period, visual outcome improved.

40|$|This study {{included}} 12 Chinese {{patients with a}} wide spectrum of phenotypes of tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency. Seven females and 5 males, aged 2. 2 to 41 years, had phenotypes ranging from severe type with onset at infancy to <b>mild</b> <b>type</b> with onset after 3 years of age. Patients with the severe type had encephalopathy with poor treatment response or infantile parkinsonism with motor delay. Patients with the less common <b>mild</b> <b>type</b> had dopa-responsive dystonia or a newly recognized predominant symptom of myopathy. Female siblings had more severe phenotypes. The phenotype and treatment outcomes were strongly related to a homovanillic acid level and homovanillic acid/ 5 -hydroxyindolacetic acid ratio of less than 1 in the cerebrospinal fluid.

40|$|A {{striking}} {{characteristic of}} glacial climate in the North Atlantic region is the recurrence of abrupt shifts between cold stadials and mild interstadials. These shifts {{have been associated}} with abrupt changes in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) mode, possibly in response to glacial meltwater perturbations. However, it is poorly understood why they were more clearly expressed during Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3, ~ 60 - 27 ka BP) than during Termination 1 (T 1, ~ 18 - 10 ka BP) and especially around the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ~ 23 - 19 ka BP). One clue may reside in varying climate forcings, making MIS 3 and T 1 generally milder than LGM. To investigate this idea, we evaluate in a climate model how ice sheet size, atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration and orbital insolation changes between 56 ka BP (= 56 k), 21 k and 12. 5 k affect the glacial AMOC response to additional freshwater forcing. We have performed three ensemble simulations with the earth system model LOVECLIM using those forcings. We find that the AMOC mode in the <b>mild</b> glacial climate <b>type</b> (56 k and 12. 5 k), with deep convection in the Labrador Sea and the Nordic Seas, is more sensitive to a constant 0. 15 Sv freshwater forcing than in the cold type (21 k), with deep convection mainly south of Greenland and Iceland. The initial AMOC weakening in response to freshwater forcing is larger in the <b>mild</b> <b>type</b> due to an early shutdown of Labrador Sea deep convection, which is completely absent in the 21 k simulation. This causes a larger fraction of the freshwater anomaly to remain at surface in the <b>mild</b> <b>type</b> compared to the cold type. After 200 years, a weak AMOC is established in both climate types, as further freshening is compensated by an anomalous salt advection from the (sub-) tropical North Atlantic. However, the slightly fresher sea surface in the <b>mild</b> <b>type</b> facilitates further weakening of the AMOC, which occurs when a surface buoyancy threshold (- 0. 6 kg...|$|R
40|$|The entity {{of chronic}} {{hepatitis}} {{has long been}} an enigma, and its treatment confusing. Recent studies have indicated the importance of excluding causes such as drugs, Wilson’s disease and α 1 -antitrypsin deficiency. After excluding such causes, there are 3 major groups — ‘autoimmune’, hepatitis B, and non-A, non-B (NANB) in all of which an immunological basis for pathogenesis exists. The autoimmune group has been subdivided into a <b>milder</b> <b>type</b> (chronic persistent hepatitis) and a more severe type (chronic active hepatitis) on histological grounds. Corticosteroids are indicated in chronic active hepatitis if cirrhosis or bridging necrosis is present. However, corticosteroids are contraindicated in disease due to the hepatitis B virus where chronic active hepatitis correlates with the presence of replicating virus (serum positive for e antigen, DNA polymerase and HBV-DNA), and in such cases antiviral agents and immunomodulation are being studied. Very little is known about NANB hepatitis {{in the absence of an}} assay and there may be more than a single agent. In hepatitis B, the development of serological markers, molecular probes (HBV-DNA), natural animal hepatitis with near-identical viruses, and δ antigen (a virus requiring coinfection with hepatitis B) have all extended our knowledge so dramatically that it is hoped that the enigma of chronic hepatitis will be solved when an assay for NANB hepatitis becomes available...|$|E
40|$|Mutations in the alpha-subunit of {{the first}} {{neuronal}} sodium channel gene SCN 1 A have been described in isolated patients with severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy or Dravet syndrome and in families with generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus. To find phenotype/genotype correlations, we reviewed all published cases of mutations in SCN 1 A in addition to four new patients reported here. A total of 60 mutations were observed. Approximately 52 % (31 / 60) are truncating mutations correlating with de novo cases of classical Dravet syndrome in 32 of 34 (94 %) patients. Missense mutations in the pore-forming part constitute 27 % (16 / 60) and correspond to a classical type in 12 of 16 (75 %) patients. Missense mutations in the voltage sensor were present in 12 % (7 / 60) and correlate with a clinical picture ranging from febrile seizures plus to severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy. Outside these regions missense mutations are rare and account for only 10 % (6 / 60), corresponding mostly with febrile seizures plus. These results illustrate that the clinical spectrum of SCN 1 A mutations ranges from febrile seizures, febrile seizures plus, over a <b>milder</b> <b>type</b> to the classical form of severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy, and confirm the clinical experience that severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy is the most severe form on this spectrum. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroduction and aimSepsis {{is defined}} as the {{systemic}} inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) which occurs during infection. One of the important features of sepsis is myocardial dysfunction. We designed this study to investigate the cardiac systolic and diastolic functions in patients presenting with SIRS and septic shock. Subjects and methodsBetween July 2009 and August 2010, 40 patients diagnosed with systemic sepsis who were admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit of Mansoura Medicine Specialized Hospital were enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into 2 groups: SIRS group composed of 18 patients (13 males); and Septic shock group composed of 22 patients (11 males). ResultsIndices of systolic function were significantly impaired in septic shock patients, where significantly higher left ventricular systolic (LVESD) and diastolic (LVEDD) dimensions and lower ejection fraction (EF) existed in these patients compared with SIRS group. Similar to the systolic function, the indices of diastolic function were also deranged in septic shock patients; who had significantly shorter mean isovolumetric relaxation time and deceleration time than SIRS patients; indicating the high prevalence of type 2 (pseudonormal) diastolic dysfunction in patients with septic shock compared to the <b>milder</b> <b>type</b> 1 diastolic dysfunction (impaired relaxation pattern) which predominated in SIRS patients. ConclusionLVESD and LVEDD are significantly increased in septic shock patients compared to patients with SIRS; while EF shows the reverse.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy and feasibility of a newly developed diabetes patient education program consisting of a three-day hospitalization and a six-month follow-up by telephone counseling for patients with <b>mild</b> <b>type</b> 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) by a randomized controlled trial (RCT) method. Fifty-two patients with <b>mild</b> <b>type</b> 2 diabetes or IGT (HbAlc< 8) were randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a control group. The current care was continued for the control group and the new education program was provided in addition to the current care for the intervention group. Changes in weight, blood glucose in a 75 g-oral glucose tolerance test (75 g-OGTT), and HbAlc were measured in June 1997 as baseline data and again in Dec. 1997. Scores for knowledge of diabetes, dietary habits, physical activity, health practice index, diabetes quality of life (DQOL), and self-efficacy were also obtained. After six months, the intervention group showed a statistically significant weight loss and blood glucose reduction in the 75 g-OGTT test, but the control group did not. A significant improvement in lifestyle was observed in the intervention group, especially in terms of dietary habits and physical activity. The knowledge test scores increased in both groups. There were no significant differences in HbAlc, DQOL, or self-efficacy between the two groups. The results of this study show that the combination of a three-day hospitalization and a six-month follow-up by telephone counseling is effective in metabolic control and improvement of lifestyle for patients with <b>mild</b> <b>type</b> 2 diabetes or IGT. The reasons for the effectiveness were considered to be that l) changes in lifestyle were based on autonomous decision-making; 2) regular, consistent counseling was provided by the nurse in charge of each patient; 3) extended follow-up is more effective than initial education in preventing a rebound of weight or metabolic control...|$|R
