5000|$|In 1998, Oxford University geneticists Simon Fisher, Anthony Monaco, Cecilia S. L. Lai, Jane A. Hurst, and Faraneh Vargha-Khadem {{identified}} an {{autosomal dominant}} <b>monogenic</b> <b>inheritance</b> that is localized {{on a small}} region of chromosome 7 from DNA samples taken from the affected and unaffected members. The chromosomal region (locus) contained 70 genes. The locus was given the official name [...] "SPCH1" [...] (for speech-and-language-disorder-1) by the Human Genome Nomenclature committee. Mapping and sequencing of the chromosomal region was performed {{with the aid of}} bacterial artificial chromosome clones. Around this time, the researchers identified an individual who was unrelated to the KE family, but had a similar type of speech and language disorder. In this case the child, known as CS, carried a chromosomal rearrangement (a translocation) in which part of chromosome 7 had become exchanged with part of chromosome 5. The site of breakage of chromosome 7 was located within the SPCH1 region.|$|E
5000|$|FOXP2 and its gene were {{discovered}} {{as a result}} of investigations on an English family known as the KE family, half of whom (fifteen individuals across three generations) suffered from a speech and language disorder called developmental verbal dyspraxia. Their case was studied at the Institute of Child Health of University London College. In 1990 Myrna Gopnik, Professor of Linguistics at McGill University, reported that the disorder-affected KE family had severe speech impediment with incomprehensible talk, largely characterized by grammatical deficits. She hypothesized that the basis was not of learning or cognitive disability, but due to genetic factors affecting mainly grammatical ability. (Her hypothesis led to a popularised existence of [...] "grammar gene" [...] and a controversial notion of grammar-specific disorder.) In 1995, the University of Oxford and the Institute of Child Health researchers found that the disorder was purely genetic. Remarkably, the inheritance of the disorder {{from one generation to the}} next was consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance, i.e., mutation of only a single gene on an autosome (non-sex chromosome) acting in a dominant fashion. This is one of the few known examples of Mendelian (<b>monogenic)</b> <b>inheritance</b> for a disorder affecting speech and language skills, which typically have a complex basis involving multiple genetic risk factors.|$|E

Plants of the generations P 1, P 2, F 1, F 2, BC 11 e BC 12 were inoculated with a Brazilian isolate of PRSV-W and were evaluated by recording symptoms. Genetic and phenotypic parameters of PRSV-W resistance were estimated and tests based on hypothesis of <b>monogenic</b> <b>inheritance</b> and maximum likelihood methods were performed. The additive component [a] of resistance was higher than the non-additive [d]. The estimates of the broad-sense heritability (0. 80) and of narrow-sense heritability (0. 67) indicated that the genetic variance was greater than the environmental, allowing higher genetic gains in selecting more resistant plants in segregating populations.

40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} mode of {{inheritance}} of resistance in laboratory induced temephos resistant and susceptible strains of Ae. aegypti. 			Homozygous resistant and susceptible strains of Ae. aegypti were generated by selective inbreeding at a diagnostic dose of 0. 02 [*]mg/L 			of temephos. Genetic crosses were carried out between these strains to determine the inheritance pattern of temephos resistance. The log-dosage probit mortality relationships and degree of dominance (D) were calculated. The dosage-mortality (d-m) line of the F 1 generation was nearer to the resistant parent than the susceptible one. The “D” value was calculated as 0. 15 indicating that the temephos resistant gene 			is incompletely dominant. The d-m lines of the F 2 generation and progeny from the backcross exhibited clear plateaus of mortality 			across a range of doses indicating that temephos resistance is controlled by a single gene. 			Comparison of the mortality data with the theoretical expectations using the χ 2 test revealed 			no significant difference, confirming a <b>monogenic</b> pattern of <b>inheritance.</b> In conclusion, the study provides evidence that the temephos resistance in Ae. aegypti follows an incompletely dominant and <b>monogenic</b> mode of <b>inheritance...</b>|$|R
40|$|Aiming {{to study}} the genetic control of Papaya ringspot virus, type {{watermelon}} (PRSV-W) in watermelon, the cultivar Crimson Sweet (P 1 – susceptible) and L 26 derived from PI 244019 (P 2 – resistant), {{as well as the}} resulting populations F 1, F 2, RC 11 and RC 21 of the cross of both lines were evaluated. The trials were carried out in a greenhouse, and the evaluations were done using artificial inoculations with PRSV-W isolates. The seedling symptoms were recorded using a graded scale, and the serological evaluation was done with specific antiserum using indirect ELISA. The estimated variances of the populations were used to obtain the genetic (σ 2 G), the environmental (σ 2 E), phenotypic (σ 2 F 2), additive (σ 2 A) and dominance (σ 2 D) variances as well as the broad (h 2 a) and narrow sense (h 2 r) heritabilities. The hypothesis of <b>monogenic</b> <b>inheritance</b> was tested under different presumed average degrees of dominance as well as using the maximum likelihood. The distribution of resistant plants in the segregating populations was different from a distribution based on <b>monogenic</b> <b>inheritance</b> for all presumed average degrees of dominance, therefore, the hypothesis of <b>monogenic</b> <b>inheritance</b> was rejected indicating that this character in the line L 26 is controlled by more than one major gene with the presence of modifiers. The additive-dominant model was adequate to explain the type of gene action involved, and the epistatic effects were not important in the expression of the resistance.

There was positive correlation of bract type with fibre strength (normal bract allele and alleles for strong fibre seemed {{to be on the same}} chromosome). The absence of correlation of the gene for frego bract with the other traits, shows that it segregates independently in relation to those traits.

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} the genetic cause in 2 Belgian families with autosomal recessive Huntington-like disorder (HDL). Methods: Homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing in a consanguineous {{family as well}} as Sanger sequencing of the candidate gene in an independent family with HDL followed by genotype-phenotype correlation studies. Results: We identified a homozygous mutation in the gene RNF 216 p. (Gly 456 Glu) within a shared 4. 8 -Mb homozygous region at 7 p 22. 3 in 2 affected siblings of a consanguineous HDL family. In an independent family, 2 siblings with HDL were compound heterozygous for mutations in RNF 216 p. (Gln 302 *) and p. (Tyr 539 Cys). Chorea, behavioral problems, and severe dementia were the core clinical signs in all patients. Brain imaging consistently showed white matter lesions. Low gonadotropin serum levels and cerebellar atrophy could be demonstrated in the index family. Conclusions: Mutations in RNF 216 have recently been found in families with Gordon Holmes syndrome, a condition defined by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and cerebellar ataxia. The mode of inheritance was proposed to be oligogenic for most families. We describe novel RNF 216 mutations causing an HDL phenotype with pure <b>monogenic</b> recessive <b>inheritance.</b> Subclinical serum evidence of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism links this disorder to Gordon Holmes syndrome.

40|$|Alport {{syndrome}} (ATS) is {{a genetically}} heterogeneous nephropathy with considerable phenotypic variability and different transmission patterns, including monogenic (X-linked/autosomal) and digenic inheritance. Here {{we present a}} new series of families with digenic inheritance and we discuss consequences for genetic counseling and risk assessment. Out of 5 families harboring variants in more than one COL 4 gene detected by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), minigene splicing assay allowed us to identify four as true digenic. Two families showed COL 4 A 3 /A 4 mutations in cis, mimicking an autosomal dominant inheritance with a more severe phenotype and one showed COL 4 A 3 /A 4 mutations in trans, mimicking an autosomal recessive inheritance with a less severe phenotype. In a fourth family a de novo mutation (COL 4 A 5) combined with an inherited mutation (COL 4 A 3) triggered a more severe phenotype. A fifth family, predicted digenic on the basis of silico tools, rather showed <b>monogenic</b> X-linked <b>inheritance</b> due to a hypomorphic mutation, in accordance with a milder phenotype. In conclusion, this study highlights the impact of digenic inheritance in ATS and explains the associated atypical presentations. More complex inheritance should be therefore considered when reviewing prognosis and recurrence risks. On the other side, these findings emphasize the importance to accompany NGS with splicing assays in order to avoid erroneous identification of at risk members...|$|R

From the 675, 500 seeds we screened, 17 mutant lines were isolated, all but one of which yielded 25 - 70 % germination levels on 250 mm NaCl medium, a condition in which their ancestor ecotypes are unable to germinate. <b>Monogenic</b> recessive <b>inheritance</b> of NaCl-tolerant germination was displayed with incomplete penetrance by all the selected mutants, which fell into five complementation groups.

Genetic analysis {{based on a}} WAWHT 2046 /Carnamah-derived double haploid (DH) population demonstrated <b>monogenic</b> <b>inheritance</b> of seedling stripe rust resistance in WAWHT 2046. The gene controlling stripe rust resistance in line WAWHT 2046 was tentatively designated YrWA. The chromosome 5 AL located awn inhibitor gene B 1, possessed by WAWHT 2046, also showed <b>monogenic</b> <b>inheritance</b> when the DH population was scored for the presence and absence of awns. Joint segregation analysis at the B 1 and YrWA loci indicated genetic linkage between the two loci. A recombination value of 12. 2 cM was computed using Mapmanager. This association located YrWA in the chromosome arm 5 AL. Molecular mapping using microsatellite markers placed YrWA distal to B 1. All molecular markers mapped proximal to the awn inhibitor locus B 1. As no other stripe rust resistance gene {{is reported to be}} located in the chromosome arm 5 AL, YrWA was permanently designated as Yr 34. Yr 34 produced an intermediate (23 C) seedling infection type and expressed very low stripe rust response (10 R-MR) on adult plants in the field, similar to the resistance gene Yr 17. In addition to Yr 34, this mapping population segregated for three genetically independent adult plant stripe rust resistance genes. The detection of DH lines with completely susceptible response, higher than that shown by the Yr 34 -lacking parent Carnamah, suggested that both parents contributed adult plant resistance.

Analysis of segregation data confirmed the <b>monogenic</b> <b>inheritance</b> of resistance. DNA from F 2 and BC 1 populations of eggplant segregating for fusarium wilt resis­tance was screened with 2, 316 primer combinations to detect polymorphism.

The l 3 S predominant seed globulins of buckwheat were found in two main groups being expressed in the cultivars and in hybrid progenies. Genetic analysis of the mode of inheritance was conducted employing two F 3 populations involving (1) a self-fertile cv. Sumchanka and F. homotropicum and (2) a self-fertile cultivar Kora and F. esculentum ssp. ancestrale. Results from both hybridized populations indicate a codominant <b>monogenic</b> mode of <b>inheritance</b> of the seed globulin...|$|R
