5|$|A {{geophysical}} {{survey of the}} area in 2008 showed unclear <b>magnetometer</b> data; the wood may be influencing the peat's hydrology, causing the loss or collection of minerals within the pore water and peat matrix.|$|E
5|$|A Ganymede orbiter {{based on}} the Juno probe was {{proposed}} in 2010 for the Planetary Science Decadal Survey. Possible instruments include Medium Resolution Camera, Flux Gate <b>Magnetometer,</b> Visible/NIR Imaging Spectrometer, Laser Altimeter, Low and High Energy Plasma Packages, Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer, UV Imaging Spectrometer, Radio and Plasma Wave sensor, Narrow Angle Camera, and a Sub-Surface Radar.|$|E
25|$|Various <b>magnetometers</b> use NMR {{effects to}} measure {{magnetic}} fields, including proton precession <b>magnetometers</b> (PPM) (also known as proton <b>magnetometers),</b> and Overhauser <b>magnetometers.</b> See also Earth's field NMR.|$|R
50|$|At {{sufficiently}} high atomic density, {{extremely high}} sensitivity can be achieved. Spin-exchange-relaxation-free (SERF) atomic <b>magnetometers</b> containing potassium, caesium or rubidium vapor operate similarly to the caesium <b>magnetometers</b> described above, yet can reach sensitivities lower than 1 fT Hz−½. The SERF <b>magnetometers</b> only operate in small magnetic fields. The Earth's field is about 50 µT; SERF <b>magnetometers</b> operate in fields less than 0.5 µT.|$|R
50|$|<b>Magnetometers</b> for non-space use {{evolved from}} the 19th to mid-20th centuries, and were first {{employed}} in spaceflight by Sputnik 3 in 1958. A main constraint on <b>magnetometers</b> in space is the availability of power and mass. <b>Magnetometers</b> fall into 3 major categories: the fluxgate type, search coil and the ionized vapor <b>magnetometers.</b> The newest type is the Overhauser type based on nuclear magnetic resonance technology.|$|R
5|$|A {{blacksmith}} shop does {{occupy the}} current John Deere Historic Site grounds. Archaeologists used a <b>magnetometer</b> {{to locate the}} position of the forge in the original blacksmith shop, thus, the current shop shares an interior which is an exact replica of the original. The exterior of the building has the same dimensions as the original as well.|$|E
5|$|Following Voyager's {{encounters}} with Enceladus {{in the early}} 1980s, scientists postulated {{that it may be}} geologically active based on its young, reflective surface and location near the core of the Ering. Based on the connection between Enceladus and the Ering, scientists suspected that Enceladus was the source of material in the Ering, perhaps through venting of water vapor. Readings from Cassini's 2005 passage suggested that cryovolcanism, where water and other volatiles are the materials erupted instead of silicate rock, had been discovered on Enceladus. The first Cassini sighting of a plume of icy particles above Enceladus's south pole came from the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) images taken in January and February 2005, though the possibility of a camera artifact delayed an official announcement. Data from the <b>magnetometer</b> instrument during the February 17, 2005, encounter provided a hint that the feature might be real when it found evidence for a planetary atmosphere. The <b>magnetometer</b> observed an increase in the power of ion cyclotron waves near Enceladus. These waves are produced by the interaction of ionized particles and magnetic fields, and the waves' frequency can be used to identify their composition, in this case ionized water vapor. During the two following encounters, the <b>magnetometer</b> team determined that gases in Enceladus's atmosphere are concentrated over the south polar region, with atmospheric density away from the pole being much lower. The Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) confirmed this result by observing two stellar occultations during the February 17 and July 14 encounters. Unlike the <b>magnetometer,</b> UVIS failed to detect an atmosphere above Enceladus during the February encounter when it looked over the equatorial region, but did detect water vapor during an occultation over the south polar region during the July encounter.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 {{a further}} survey {{was carried out}} by Bath and Camerton Archaeological Society and the Bath and North East Somerset Archaeological Officer. This {{involved}} high data density <b>magnetometer,</b> resistance pseudosection profiles and photographic surveys showed a new henge entrance and further detail of post holes.|$|E
50|$|Absolute <b>magnetometers</b> {{measure the}} {{absolute}} magnitude or vector magnetic field, using an internal calibration or known physical constants {{of the magnetic}} sensor. Relative <b>magnetometers</b> measure magnitude or vector magnetic field relative to a fixed but uncalibrated baseline. Also called variometers, relative <b>magnetometers</b> are used to measure variations in magnetic field.|$|R
50|$|Development and {{production}} of flux-gate <b>magnetometers</b> (FGM) and induction <b>magnetometers</b> (IM) with highest parameters values possible are of the main LC ISR activity areas.|$|R
50|$|Spacecraft <b>magnetometers</b> are <b>magnetometers</b> used aboard {{spacecraft}} and satellites, {{mostly for}} scientific investigations, plus attitude sensing. <b>Magnetometers</b> {{are among the}} most widely used scientific instruments in exploratory and observation satellites. These instruments were instrumental in the discovery of the Van Allen radiation belts around Earth by Explorer 1, and have detailed the magnetic fields of the Earth, Moon, Sun, Mars, Venus and other planets. There are ongoing missions using <b>magnetometers,</b> including attempts to define the shape and activity of Saturn's core.|$|R
5|$|The Juno New Frontiers {{mission to}} Jupiter was {{launched}} in 2011 and arrived at Jupiter in 2016. It includes a suite of instruments designed {{to better understand the}} magnetosphere, including a <b>Magnetometer</b> on Juno instrument was well as other devices such as a detector for Plasma and Radio fields called Waves.|$|E
5|$|Europa Orbiter — Its {{objective}} {{would be}} to characterize {{the extent of the}} ocean and its relation to the deeper interior. Instrument payload could include a radio subsystem, laser altimeter, <b>magnetometer,</b> Langmuir probe, and a mapping camera. The Europa Orbiter received a go-ahead in 1999 but was canceled in 2002. This orbiter featured a special ice-penetrating radar that would allow it to scan below the surface.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic Airborne Detection (MAD) {{was used}} to detect {{submerged}} U-boats. It consisted of a sensitive <b>magnetometer</b> installed in the cone of the aircraft (mostly Catalinas) that could detect anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field within a range of 400 feet and was sensitive to detect a submarine to within a few feet. The mine was {{used in conjunction with}} a 65.5lb retro bomb. It was filled with 25lb of Torpex and the weapon was rocket propelled backwards to the line of flight at a speed that counteracted the aircraft's forward motion. It was released rearwards from rails on the wings of the aircraft. Thus, with the aircraft's forward motion cancelled-out by the rocket motor, the device fell directly onto the target.|$|E
30|$|Observing conditions, such as {{a change}} in {{temperature}} and the tilt of the <b>magnetometers,</b> are the most plausible causes of annual variations, but cannot fully explain the observed annual variations. The annual variations shown in Fig. 2 are already corrected using tiltmeters installed in the sensors of the <b>magnetometers,</b> and are out of phase with the temperature variation of the <b>magnetometers.</b> Furthermore, differences in total geomagnetic intensities, obtained with three proton <b>magnetometers</b> installed at different locations within MMB, show annual variations with amplitudes of ~ 1 nT (Nishimura et al., 2012). As observations with proton <b>magnetometers</b> {{are not likely to}} be largely affected by observing conditions, the observed annual variations can be considered to be actual geomagnetic variations.|$|R
40|$|Optomechanical <b>magnetometers</b> {{have been}} {{previously}} demonstrated to achieve sensitivities {{comparable to the}} state-of-the-art <b>magnetometers</b> of comparable size. They combine the ultra-precise cavity optomechanical measurement and magnetostrictive response of terfenol-d. We have achieved reproducible sensitivities of 600 pT/vHz {{using a combination of}} standard photolithography and sputter deposition techniques which provides a pathway for scalable <b>magnetometers</b> for diverse applications...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Magnetometers</b> {{are used}} to measure the {{magnetic}} fields, magnetic anomalies in the earth. The sensitivity of <b>magnetometers</b> depends upon the requirement. Ex, the variations in the geomagnetic fields can be to the order of several aT where 1aT = 10^-18T [...] In such cases, specialized <b>magnetometers</b> such as a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) are used.|$|R
5|$|The {{results were}} inconclusive, as {{three weeks of}} {{surveying}} in almost continuous bad weather during July and August 1980 failed to find Titanic. The problem was exacerbated by technological limitations; the Sea MARC sonar used by the expedition had a relatively low resolution and was a new and untested piece of equipment. It was nearly lost only 36 hours after it was first deployed when the tail was ripped off during a sharp turn, destroying the <b>magnetometer,</b> {{which would have been}} vital for detecting Titanics hull. Nonetheless it managed to survey an area of some 500 square nautical miles and identified 14 possible targets.|$|E
5|$|Thermoremanent {{magnetization}} is {{the main}} source of the magnetic anomalies around ocean ridges. As the seafloor spreads, magma wells up from the mantle, cools to form new basaltic crust {{on both sides of the}} ridge, and is carried away from it by seafloor spreading. As it cools, it records the direction of the Earth's field. When the Earth's field reverses, new basalt records the reversed direction. The result is a series of stripes that are symmetric about the ridge. A ship towing a <b>magnetometer</b> on the surface of the ocean can detect these stripes and infer the age of the ocean floor below. This provides information on the rate at which seafloor has spread in the past.|$|E
5|$|Three expeditions were mounted by Woodman to {{continue}} the <b>magnetometer</b> mapping of the proposed wreck sites, a privately sponsored expedition in 2001, and the Irish-Canadian Franklin Search Expeditions of 2002 and 2004. These made use of sled-drawn magnetometers working on the sea ice and completed the unfinished survey of the northern (Kirkwall Island) search area (2001), and the entire southern O'Reilly Island area (2002 and 2004). All high-priority magnetic targets were identified by sonar through the ice as geological in origin. In 2002 and 2004, small Franklin artefacts and characteristic explorer tent sites were found on a small islet northeast of O'Reilly Island during shore searches.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Magnetometers</b> {{can also}} be {{classified}} as [...] "AC" [...] if they measure fields that vary relatively rapidly in time (>100 Hz), and [...] "DC" [...] if they measure fields that vary only slowly (quasi-static) or are static. AC <b>magnetometers</b> find use in electromagnetic systems (such as magnetotellurics), and DC <b>magnetometers</b> are used for detecting mineralisation and corresponding geological structures.|$|R
50|$|<b>Magnetometers</b> {{such as the}} German Foerster {{are used}} to locate ferrous ordnance. Caesium and Overhauser <b>magnetometers</b> are used to locate and help clean up old bombing/test ranges.|$|R
30|$|The {{article is}} devoted to {{features}} of modulus magnetic field measurements by means of proton <b>magnetometers.</b> Inertial characteristics of the <b>magnetometers</b> and dynamic errors of variable magnetic field measurements are discussed. Three basic <b>magnetometers</b> averaging algorithms, processing zero crossing times of free precession, are compared. Theoretical and some numerical estimations of the algorithms work are presented for the linear, square and harmonic variations of magnetic field.|$|R
5|$|Searches were resumed for {{the lost}} Endeavour Reef cannons, but expeditions in 1966, 1967, and 1968 were unsuccessful. They were finally {{recovered}} in 1969 by a research team from the American Academy of Natural Sciences, using a sophisticated <b>magnetometer</b> to locate the cannons, a quantity of iron ballast and the abandoned bower anchor. Conservation work on the cannons was undertaken by the Australian National Maritime Museum, after which two of the cannons were displayed at its headquarters in Sydney's Darling Harbour, and eventually put on display at Botany Bay and the National Museum of Australia in Canberra (with a replica remaining at the museum). A third cannon and the bower anchor were displayed at the James Cook Museum in Cooktown, with the remaining three at the National Maritime Museum in London, the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no obvious}} visual {{evidence}} of the linear features usually associated with farm fields in the land surrounding Chetro Ketl, but in 1929 aerial black-and-white images by Charles Lindbergh revealed {{what appeared to be}} a rectangular plot. In the early 1970s the National Park Service (NPS) developed a remote sensing program to further investigate the area using color video imagery. When enhanced and viewed in black-and-white, the video revealed a well-defined grid pattern within a larger rectangular section of land near Chetro Ketl. The NPS employed two types of ground level remote sensing devices to search for magnetic and soil anomalies in the alluvium of the canyon floor. A soil density study proved inconclusive, but a <b>magnetometer</b> identified a rectangular feature , roughly the same size as those seen in Lindbergh's aerial photographs. The NPS researchers proposed that water had deposited iron-bearing clays in the plots, with the center showing the strongest magnetic evidence. Subsequent comparisons with older data reinforced their conclusion. They determined that had the plots been under heavy alluvium they would not have been detected.|$|E
25|$|A {{fluxgate}} <b>magnetometer</b> {{measures the}} direction and magnitude of magnetic fields. Fluxgate <b>magnetometer</b> sensors are manufactured in several geometries and recently have made significant improvements in noise performance, crossfield tolerance and power utilization. The fluxgate <b>magnetometer</b> was invented by Victor Vacquier in 1940 while working for Gulf Research in Pittsburgh.|$|E
50|$|PPMs {{were once}} {{widely used in}} mineral exploration. They have largely been {{superseded}} by Overhauser effect <b>magnetometers</b> and alkali vapour (cesium, rubidium, potassium) or helium <b>magnetometers,</b> which sample faster and are more sensitive.|$|R
5000|$|Proton {{precession}} <b>magnetometers</b> (PPM) or proton <b>magnetometers,</b> {{which produce}} magnetic resonance in a known sample in {{the magnetic field}} to be measured, measure the sample's resonant frequency, then calculate and display the field strength.|$|R
5000|$|Following the WFPC2 installation, Hoffman changed out two <b>magnetometers</b> {{on board}} HST. The <b>magnetometers,</b> which are {{located at the}} top of the telescope, are the satellite's [...] "compass". They enable HST to find its {{orientation}} with respect to the Earth's magnetic field. Both original units were suffering from problems of background noise. During installation, two pieces peeled off the <b>magnetometers.</b> The EVA lasted 6 hours and 47 minutes.|$|R

40|$|There {{has always}} been a need to monitor the near Earth's {{magnetic}} field, as this monitoring provides understanding and possible predictions of Space Weather events such as geomagnetic storms. Conventional <b>magnetometers</b> such as fluxgates have been used for decades for Space Weather research. The use of highly sensitive <b>magnetometers</b> such as Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs), promise to give more insight into Space Weather. SQUIDs are relatively recent types of <b>magnetometers</b> that exploit the superconductive effects of flux quantization and Josephson tunneling to measure magnetic flux. SQUIDs have a very broad bandwidth compared to most conventional <b>magnetometers</b> and can measure magnetic flux as low as a few femtotesla. Since SQUIDs have never been used in Space Weather research, unshielded, it is necessary to investigate if they can be reliable Space Weather instruments. The validation is performed by comparing the frequency content of the SQUID and fluxgate <b>magnetometers,</b> as reported by Phiri...|$|R
