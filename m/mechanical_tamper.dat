50|$|Soil is {{a widely}} available, inexpensive, and {{sustainable}} resource. Therefore, construction with rammed earth is very viable. Unskilled labour can {{do most of the}} necessary work. While the cost of rammed earth is low, rammed-earth construction without mechanical tools is very time-consuming and laborious; however, with a <b>mechanical</b> <b>tamper</b> and prefabricated formwork it can require only two or three days to construct the walls of a 200 to 220 m2 house.|$|E
5|$|There is {{not much}} {{evidence}} that the chariot races were subject to bribes {{or other forms of}} cheating in the Roman Empire. In the Byzantine Empire, there seems to have been more cheating; Justinian I's reformed legal code prohibits drivers from placing curses on their opponents, but otherwise there {{does not seem to have}} been any <b>mechanical</b> <b>tampering</b> or bribery. Wearing the colours of one's team became an important aspect of Byzantine dress.|$|R
50|$|A {{tamping machine}} or ballast tamper is a machine used to pack (or tamp) the track ballast under railway tracks {{to make the}} tracks more durable. Prior to the {{introduction}} of <b>mechanical</b> <b>tampers,</b> this task was done by manual labour with the help of beaters. As well as being faster, more accurate, more efficient and less labour-intensive, tamping machines are essential for the use of concrete sleepers since they are too heavy (usually over 250 kg) to be lifted by hand. Whilst also available as a plain tamper with no lifting or lining function this article will focus on the multi function machines.|$|R
50|$|Soon after {{learning}} about India's nuclear test, Qureshi was summoned by Munir Ahmad Khan in March 1974, where {{he attended the}} meeting with Munir Ahmad Khan, Abdus Salam, Riazuddin, Ishfaq Ahmad, and Munir Ahmad Rashid. At this meeting, Qureshi was tasked with developing the <b>mechanical</b> components, <b>tampers,</b> and explosive optical lenses necessary for detonation of the weapon. Instructions were given by Munir Ahmad Khan to Qureshi that he joins hands on a project of national importance with another expert, dr. Zaman Sheikh, a chemical engineer from DESTO. A codename, Wah Group Scientist (WGS), was given for the group that was established. Another session was held on the feasibility of the weapon which was attended by Abdus Salam and Riazuddin as the representatives of Theoretical Physics Group (TPG); Asghar Qadir and Munir Ahmad Rashid of Mathematical Physics Group; Ishfaq Ahmad of Nuclear Physics Division; and Qureshi and dr. Zaman of Wah Group Scientists (WGS). During the meeting, the word Bomb was never used, instead the scientists used scientific research rationale. There, the scientists decided to develop an 'implosion' over the 'gun' type fission device citing economy {{in the use of}} fissile material.|$|R
