Second marriages were not uncommon, and widows and widowers faced social and economic pressures to remarry. On average, most widows and widowers remarried within {{six months to a}} year. Most adults who reached <b>marriageable</b> <b>age</b> lived into their sixties, so effectively two-thirds of a person's life was spent married.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent decades}} Hong Kong has {{experienced}} remarkable demographic and social changes. The trend towards late marriage and less marriage has gained great attention {{because they have}} profound demographic, economic and social consequences. The demographic perspective of "marriage squeeze" explores the effect on marriage of an imbalance between the numbers {{of males and females}} in <b>marriageable</b> <b>ages,</b> and its impact on human marriage behaviors. The present research examines the marriage squeeze in the past decades in Hong Kong by several quantitative measurements and presents the transformations of the local marriage market during the corresponding years. Results show that the great number of male immigrants from Mainland China into Hong Kong in later 1970 s caused a severe marriage squeeze against males due to the extremely imbalanced sex ratio in the marriage market. This male marriage squeeze was gradually relieved and the marriage market was balanced in later 1990 s by the physiological fading out of the excess males from the marriage market, as well as the large number of introduction of "Mainland brides" during the years. A new trend toward a female marriage squeeze emerged from the beginning of 21 st century which yet needs further observation. This research provides demographic interpretations to some changes in the marriage behaviors like late and less marriage of Hong Kong females, as well as the variations of age difference between spouses in recent decades. Sociological and economic factors are also considered in the analysis of these changes in order to provide a comprehensive illustration...|$|R
50|$|Japan foreign {{marriage}} is a phenomenon occurring in rural Japan. Since the mid 1980s, rural Japanese men have begun taking foreign brides, mainly those from the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and other Asian countries, {{as a way of}} countering the reduced number of women who are of <b>marriageable,</b> childbearing <b>age</b> that are willing to marry rural Japanese men. The phenomenon has created a new industry of foreign marriage brokering that uses both local governments and private organizations to facilitate the immigration of foreign brides. This is largely a result of an aging population in Japan where approximately 20% of the population is over the age of 65, which is exceptionally high, a fertility rate of only 1.3, and increased opportunities for women and increased costs in child care.|$|R
40|$|Conference details: Female Deficit in Asia: Trends and Perspectives. International conference, Singapore, 5 - 7 December 2005 There {{has been}} a {{substantial}} {{increase in the number of}} Vietnamese women marrying Taiwanese men and moving to Taiwan via introduction agencies. There is also an increasing similar flow of Vietnamese young women to marry Chinese men in Southern China. The women are very young and mostly from rural areas and have low levels of education. There are age gaps between wife and husband as well as language gaps. In the destination, some girls are virtually treated as slaves by their husbands' relatives; some have been sold to brothels by their husbands or have become victims of domestic violence. This international marriage migration is attracting research attention of both Vietnamese and international experts. They have looked at the matter from different viewpoints. This paper differs from most in that it provides a view of this trend from the sending place. It uses data from a large-scale survey, which was conducted by the Institute of Population, Family and Children collaborating with the Department ofSociology at the School of Social Sciences and Humanities, National University in Ho Chi Minh City. It included 1084 structured interviews with 624 households and 460 young people in 6 provinces in Cuu Long River Delta, Vietnam where most of the brides come from. Also, 110 in-depth interviews with 82 brides and 28 local authorities were completed. Moreover, 23 focus group discussions were conducted. Low socioeconomic status in the family of the young women was found to be a chief determinant of the marriage. Nearly all brides have chosen marriage to Taiwan men as a way to improve their life conditions and to help their families get out of hard circumstances. However, low level of skill and language barriers have let to many if not most of the brides facing difficulties in the destination. In the origin community, there is a growing concern about imbalance between the number of men and women in the <b>marriageable</b> <b>ages</b> because nearly 50 % of girls aged 18 - 30 have married to foreigners in some villages. On the other hand, the areas where many of these women are moving to also have a deficit of young females although that is not the only structured factor, which underlies the migration.

5000|$|Throughout the Middle Ages the {{definition}} of a prostitute has been ambiguous, with various secular and canonical organizations defining prostitution in constantly evolving terms. Even though medieval secular authorities created legislation to deal with the phenomenon of prostitution, they rarely attempted to define what a prostitute was because it was deemed unnecessary [...] "to specify exactly who fell into that specific category" [...] of a prostitute. The first known definition of prostitution was found in Marseille's thirteenth century statutes, which included a chapter entitled De meretricibus ("regarding prostitutes"). The Marseillais designated prostitutes as [...] "public girls" [...] who, day and night, received two or more men in their house, and as a woman who [...] "did business trading bodies, within the confines of a brothel." [...] A fourteenth-century English tract, Fasciculus Morum, states that the term prostitute (termed 'meretrix' in this document), [...] "must be applied only to those women who give themselves to anyone and will refuse none, and that for monetary gain". In general prostitution was not typically a life-time career choice for women. Women usually alternated their career of prostitution with [...] "petty retailing, and victualing," [...] or only occasionally turning to prostitution in times of great financial need. Women who became prostitutes often did not have the familial ties or means to protect themselves from the lure of prostitution, and it has been recorded on several occasions that mothers would be charged with prostituting their own daughters in exchange for extra money.Medieval civilians accepted without question the fact of prostitution, it was necessary part of medieval life. Prostitutes subverted the sexual tendencies of male youth, just by existing. With the establishment of prostitution men were less likely to collectively rape honest women of <b>marriageable</b> and re-marriageable <b>age.</b> This is most clearly demonstrated in St. Augustine's claim that [...] "the removal of the institution would bring lust into all aspects of the world." [...] Meaning that without prostitutes to subvert male tendencies, men would go after innocent women instead, thus the prostitutes were actually doing society a favor.|$|R
25|$|Some Islamic {{scholars}} {{suggest that}} it is not the calendar age that matters, rather it is the biological age of the girl that determines when she can be married under Islamic law.
