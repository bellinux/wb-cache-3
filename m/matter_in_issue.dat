60|$|Harriet Westbrook was a school-girl {{sixteen years}} old. Shelley was teeming with {{advanced}} thought. He believed that Christianity was a degrading and selfish superstition, {{and he had}} a deep and sincere desire to rescue one of his sisters from it. Harriet was impressed by his various philosophies and looked upon him as an intellectual wonder--which indeed he was. He had an idea that she could give him valuable help in his scheme regarding his sister; therefore he asked her to correspond with him. She was quite willing. Shelley was not thinking of love, for he was just getting over a passion for his cousin, Harriet Grove, and just getting well steeped in one for Miss Hitchener, a school-teacher. What might happen to Harriet Westbrook before the letter-writing was ended did not enter his mind. Yet an older person could have made a good guess at it, for in person Shelley was as beautiful as an angel, he was frank, sweet, winning, unassuming, and so rich in unselfishness, generosities, and magnanimities that he made his whole generation seem poor in these great qualities by comparison. Besides, he was in distress. His college had expelled him for writing an atheistical pamphlet and afflicting the reverend heads of the university with it, his rich father and grandfather had closed their purses against him, his friends were cold. Necessarily, Harriet fell in love with him; and so deeply, indeed, {{that there was no way}} for Shelley to save her from suicide but to marry her. He believed himself to blame for this state of things, so the marriage took place. He was pretty fairly in love with Harriet, although he loved Miss Hitchener better. He wrote and explained the case to Miss Hitchener after the wedding, and he could not have been franker or more naive and less stirred up about the circumstance if the <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> <b>issue</b> had been a commercial transaction involving thirty-five dollars.|$|E

40|$|Parties {{litigant}} {{desire to}} obtain before trial all possible information {{relevant to the}} <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> <b>issue.</b> Obviously their opponents possess much of this information but are usually reluctant to divulge it. If the production of such information is compelled, however, this will frequently result in promptly clearing up those issues in the case concerning which {{there can be no}} bona fide controversy, thus saving time and cost both to the parties and to the state. Moreover such compulsion may tend to prevent substantial injustice to the party seeking information in the exclusive possession of his opponent. Both these results are desirable. But other considerations of equal social import render it undesirable to enable a party to find out before trial all that his adversary knows about the case. One problem is therefore to ascertain the extent to which discovery should be allowed, in order best to promote its usefulness without violating the latter considerations. The other problem is to find the machinery best adapted to obtain production of information, or documents, to the extent found desirable. This article aims to deal with these two problems and with a view to their solution attempts a sur- vey and examination of the existing statutes and decisions on the subject...|$|E

40|$|The chief {{practical}} difficulty today, as always, lies in {{the particular}} application of a mass of evidentiary rules, in determining the bearing of various principles upon a given evidentiary issue of fact here and now.

40|$|The {{identification}} of arbitration {{as it is}} constituted in legal lore is not very difficult. There is a near consensus of judicial utterance and statutory provision posing it as a process for hearing and deciding controversies of economic consequence arising between parties. It begins with and depends upon an agreement of the parties to submit their claims {{to one or more}} persons chosen by them to serve as their arbitrator. Certain significant legal requirements governing the hearing and decision of the claims submitted attach unless the parties stipulate against them or otherwise waive them; they attach without any necessity of their stipulation. These minimum legal requirements assure: (1) Mutual rights of hearing. Each party is entitled to reasonable notice of time and place of hearing to be had before the arbitrators sitting in due quorum, an opportunity to present evidence in his own behalf relating to the <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> <b>issue</b> and an opportunity to cross-examine opposing evidence. (2) Mutual rights that, after hearing, the arbitrators shall render such award on the issues submitted to them as they deem fair and just-whether or not according to law. To the award attach legal finality, conclusiveness and enforceability subject only to limited causes to defeat or vacate the award. This generic {{identification of}} arbitration does not, of course, reckon with the details of distinctions between common law and statutory arbitration, nor with the declared distinctions between arbitration of commercial and labor-management causes. It does not take account of any precise similarities to or differences from processes of settling controversies frequently cited as 2 ̆ 2 appraisals, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 valuations 2 ̆ 2 or miscellaneous methods of compromise or settlement. Nor does this identification comprehend so-called 2 ̆ 2 compulsory arbitration. ...|$|E

5000|$|A Dispute Board {{becomes a}} part of the project {{administration}} and thereby can influence, during the contract period, the performance of the contracting parties. It has 'real-time' value. The idea behind a standing Dispute Resolution Board is that it may be called upon early in the evolution of any dispute which cannot be resolved by the parties and be asked to publish decisions or recommendations on how the <b>matters</b> <b>in</b> <b>issue</b> should be settled. It is usual (but not compulsory) that an opportunity remains for the matter to be referred to arbitration or to the courts if the Dispute Review Board's decision does not find acceptance by the parties. Thus a Dispute Resolution Board may be likened to the United Kingdom's adjudication process, either under statutory-compliant contracts or under the regime established by statute itself [...] What a Dispute Review Board does that United Kingdom statutory adjudication does not do is to provide a regular and continuing forum for discussion of difficult or contentious matters, to identify ways forward by acting in an informal capacity and to create valuable opportunities for the parties to avoid disputes by keeping proactive communication alive. Another aspect, which is less often discussed, is that by establishing a Dispute Board from the inception of the project the Dispute Board members become part of the project team and are thought of in a different fashion and because of their [...] "hands on" [...] approach can be trusted to be fair and impartial and their advise respected and taken more readily than would a third party or stranger to the project.|$|R

40|$|The {{assurance}} {{of a better}} judicial cooperation between European Union Member States is aconstant preoccupation of the Council of Europe, taking into consideration that the European Union has setitself the objective of maintaining and developing an area of freedom, security and justice. The achievementof this objective is only possible if among EU Member States {{there is a high}} level of confidence and a mutualrecognition of the decisions issued by the competent judicial authorities. The European arrest warrant was thefirst concrete measure in the field of criminal law implementing the principle of mutual recognition which theEuropean Council referred to as cornerstone of judicial cooperation. It was followed by other measuresdesigned to create the legal framework of the judicial cooperation; some of these measures concerns the fightagainst corruption, terrorism, cross-border criminality, racism and xenophobia while others are applicable inany case, such as the order of freezing the property and the evidence. On 18 December 2008, a newinstrument was created in order to improve the judicial cooperation between the Member States: the Europeanevidence warrant.

Recent clinical trials have demonstrated superior mortality outcomes with primary angioplasty compared with thrombolytic therapy. 1 – 3 However, physicians should consider several important fac-tors when choosing between these reperfusion options. Time <b>Matters</b> <b>In</b> this <b>issue</b> of ecp, Kent and colleagues have addressed one of these factors—the difference in treatment time for primary angioplasty versus thrombolysis. 4 For patients receiving thrombolytic therapy, time to treatment {{is defined as the}} time from hospital arrival to the initiation of intravenous thrombolysis. For patients undergo-ing primary angioplasty, the time to treatment is the time from hospital arrival to first balloon inflation. In either case, the shorter the time to treatment, the more rapidly reperfusion can be achieved and the greater the survival benefit. The time to treatment for thrombolysis is shorter than that for primary angio-plasty because thrombolytic therapy can be delivered in the emergency department, whereas patients need to be transferred to a cardiac catheterization laboratory t...|$|R

From 1770 the general officers making inspections of troops were instructed to ensure that colours were in conformity with the 1768 warrant. However, they had little knowledge of the correct emblazoning of heraldic devices, and regiments frequently turned to the officers of the College of Arms for advice on the <b>matter.</b> Delays <b>in</b> <b>issuing</b> new colours due to doubts about the regulation design meant that old ones remained in service long after they had become unserviceable: for example the colours of the 9th (East Norfolk) Regiment of Foot were found in 1798 to be [...] "...nothing but rags, so that no device or number could be seen on them".|$|R
