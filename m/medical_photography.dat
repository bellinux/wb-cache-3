In Europe, several further cases of intersexuality were documented, {{although there is}} no evidence that the photographers were aware of Nadar's work. In April 1870 a Monsieur Delacroix presented photographs of an intersex individual at the Société Médicale de Reims. In 1930 German physician Magnus Hirschfeld published a portrait of himself with an intersex individual in his five-volume Geschlechtskunde (Sexology), while Louis Ombrédanne published 25 images of cases he had handled in his 1939 book Les hermaphrodites et la chirurgie (Hermaphrodites and Surgery).|$|E

2500|$|Frederic Hardwicke Knight, QSO [...] (12 July 1911 – [...] 25 August 2008) was a London-born photographer, {{historian}} and collector who emigrated to New Zealand in 1957 {{to take up}} a <b>medical</b> <b>photography</b> position in Dunedin.

His publications include New Zealand's first comprehensive photographic history, many compilations of early Dunedin and Otago photographs, biographies of several early New Zealand photographers and of British photographer William Russell Sedgfield, three books of architectural history and a seminal history of the Otago Peninsula. He was awarded a QSO in 1991.

2500|$|Medical imaging is the {{generating}} {{of visual}} {{representations of the}} interior of a body for clinical analysis and medical intervention. Medical imaging reveals details of internal physiology that help medical professionals plan appropriate treatments for tissue infection and trauma. [...] Medical imaging is also central in supplying the biometric data necessary to establish baseline features of anatomy and physiology so as to increase the accuracy with which early or fine-detail abnormalities are detected. [...] These diagnostic techniques are often performed in combination with general pathology procedures and are themselves often essential to developing new understanding of the pathogenesis of a given disease and tracking the progress of disease in specific medical cases. [...] Examples of important subdivisions in medical imaging include radiology (which uses the imaging technologies of X-ray radiography) magnetic resonance imaging, [...] medical ultrasonography (or ultrasound), endoscopy, elastography, tactile imaging, thermography, <b>medical</b> <b>photography,</b> nuclear medicine and functional imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography. [...] Though they do not strictly relay images, readings from diagnostics tests involving electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, and electrocardiography often give hints as to the state and function of certain tissues in the brain and heart respectively.|$|E

50|$|Dr. Jean-Martin Charcot, {{a student}} of Duchenne de Boulogne, {{believed}} like Diamond that photographs would {{play a significant role}} in the diagnosis and management of patients. A <b>medical</b> <b>photography</b> unit was established at Salpêtrière hospital in Paris in 1878 by Charcot. He hired Albert Londe who worked at Salpêtrière under Charcot's supervision. Londe was to not only make photographs but to create new apparatus to record signs and symptoms. Charcot began publishing Nouvelle iconographie de la Salpêtriere in 1888 that used photographs to show clinical presentations of cases at Salpêtrière. Londe published a major reference on the practice of <b>medical</b> <b>photography</b> La Photographie médicale. in 1893.

30|$|Imaging systems (sensors) {{are widely}} used in various {{applications}} such as remote sensing, non-destructive control, <b>medical</b> diagnostics, <b>photography,</b> etc. [1]. Some acquired images need a special pre-processing (e.g., denoising, deblurring, edge detection, compression [2 – 4], etc.) for further exploitation (e.g., object recognition, visual inspection, diagnostics, etc.). In order to enhance an image using, e.g., modern image denoising methods based on wavelets [5 – 7] or discrete cosine transform (DCT) [8, 9] transforms, one has to know a noise type and its basic characteristics such as probability density function (PDF), variance, or two-dimensional (2 D) spatial correlation function (if the observed noise is not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)). Proper thresholds in edge detection and image segmentation depend on noise statistics as well [1, 10]. In lossy image compression, a quantization step has to be adaptively adjusted depending on noise variance [11].|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim in {{this study}} is to compare the {{functional}} results of open septorhinoplasty with and without osteotomies performed with the aim of increasing respiratory functions and healing the deformations in patients with traumatic nasal deformations. Material and Methods: In this prospective and clinical study, 26 patients with traumatic nasal deformation, who applied between 2007 and 2009 were analyzed. The physical examination, <b>medical</b> <b>photographies,</b> the findings of periorbital edema and ecchymosis and changes in respiratory behaviors before and after the operation were recorded. Evident irregularities of nasal dorsum, septum deviation and respiratory distress were identified in all of the patients. Open septorhinoplasty with osteotomy (13 patients and ndash; 50 %) and without osteotomy (13 patients and ndash; 50 %) were applied to a total of 26 patients. Osteotomy decision was given according to nasal dorsal width and nasal height. All the patients were controlled in the in the first, third, sixth and twelfth months of the postoperative period to analyze the results. The data gathered through these cases were compared with the literature. Results: Functional improvements were observed after open septorhinoplasty operations in all patients. When the post-operative results of the open septorhinoplasty operations with and without osteotomy are compared, it was observed that among the group of patients on which osteotomies were not practiced respiratory complaints improved better, stricture in the nasal passage was not caused, edema and ecchymosis in the postoperative period was lesser. Conclusion: In this study, the attempt was to prove that although open septorhinoplasty operations are classically performed with osteotomy, the operations without osteotomy has not cause stricture in the nasal passage, it causes less edema and ecchymosis in the postoperative period compared to the group with osteotomy. It is an acceptable procedure for patients chosen in the preoperative period through a detailed preliminary work. [Cukurova Med J 2015; 40 (4. 000) : 738 - 745...|$|R
