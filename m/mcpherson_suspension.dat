The MacPherson strut setup is still being used on high performance cars such as the Porsche 911, several Mercedes-Benz models and lower BMW models due to its light weight, design simplicity and low manufacturing cost. This paper proposes a systematic and comprehensive development of a two-dimensional mathematical model of a <b>McPherson</b> <b>suspension.</b> The model considers not only the vertical motion of the chassis (sprung mass) but also rotation and translation for unsprung mass (wheel assembly). Furthermore, this model includes wheel mass and its moment of inertia about the longitudinal axis.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the {{enhancement}} of vehicle handling characteristics through the active kinematic control system (AKCS) is investigated. AKCS can improve the stability and ride comfort of a vehicle by automatically controlling suspension geometry {{in accordance with the}} running con-ditions of a vehicle. The variable roll centre suspension concept in a <b>McPherson</b> strut <b>suspension</b> is proposed, and lateral acceleration feedback control is derived to calculate the control input. The independent rear wheel steering system, which controls both rear wheels independently and actively, is also proposed. To achieve this, three suggested positions for controlling the suspension geometry are considered. The rst position is between the mounting point of the lower arm of a <b>McPherson</b> front <b>suspension</b> and the vehicle body. The second position is between the mounting point of the strut and the vehicle body. The third position is between the mounting point of the lateral link of the multilink rear suspension and the vehicle body. In order to evaluate the handling performance, a 15 degrees of freedom full vehicle model is constructed using the commercial multibody analysis program ADAMS. The control inputs for integrated control of the front and rear suspensions are dened, and roll centre migration and vehicle behaviour are investigated. In step steering and double lane change manoeuvres, the simulation results demonstrate that integrated kinematic control can adjust the roll centre migration, by which the handling characteristics of the AKCS vehicle such as roll angle, lateral acceleration and yaw rate are much improved...|$|R

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} suspension system and its lower arm. These analyses were specifically applied on lower suspension arm to determine its vibration and stress behaviour during its operation. The suspension system {{is one of the}} most important components of vehicle, which directly affects the safety, performance, noise level and style of it. The main objectives are to have less stress on lower suspension arm system as well as to reduce imposed load by optimization. The optimization of imposed load on lower suspension arm system is directly related to imposed force on the vehicle created by the road. This load has a direct effect on the value of imposed force on lower arm, where the lower arm force will be minimized by reducing the applied load. Hence, genetic algorithms for optimization and MATLAB optimization toolbar are used, as well as, specific M-file codes have been developed into MATLAB for optimization. By determining optimized design values of suspension system for reducing road force, it is possible to survey vibration condition of lower arm according to frequency respond of suspension system and its natural frequency. Therefore, frequency response of its acceleration has been determined according to the whole mass of suspension system.

It is probably true to say that the average member of the vehicle owning public is unaware of the range of duties performed by a vehicle suspension.

Resolving design matters in advance, through in-depth {{understanding of the}} design planning and rework issues and development of effective predictive tools could contribute to higher business profit margins and a faster product time-to-market. This research aims to develop three novel and structured methods to predict the design rework occurrence and effort at the very early design stage, which may otherwise remain undiscovered until the testing and refinement phase. The major contribution obtained from the Design Rework Probability of Occurrence Estimation method, DRePOE, {{is the development of}} design rework drivers. The developed drivers have been synthesised with data from interview results, direct observations, and archival records obtained from eleven world-class aerospace and automotive components manufacturers. To predict the probability of occurrence, the individual score of each driver was compared against historical records utilising the analogy-based method. The Design Rework Effort Estimation method, DREE, was developed to interconnect functional structures and identify failure relationships among components. A significant contribution of The DREE method is its capability to assess the design rework effort at the component level under the worst-case scenario.

For instance in the automotive sector so-called Wheel Center Forces (WCFs), i. e. the forces acting {{on the center of}} the vehicle wheels, are required in order to perform durability analyses. WCFs can be directly measured by means of dedicated measurement wheels, but the latter turn out to be expensive, intrusive and time-consuming to install. An appealing alternative could be to virtually measure those forces by combining information coming from a system model and more economical, less intrusive and easier-to-install sensors. State estimation is the mathematical tool {{that can be used in}} order to combine simulation and sensors data and to estimate the quantity of interest. More specifically, in this work, an augmented Extended Kalman Filter (A-EKF) based on a multibody model of the system and on a random walk model for the unknown forces is used to process the sensors information. A penalty formulation is used in order to write the equations of the multibody system into the form required for the specific state estimator. A virtual experiment on a <b>McPherson</b> <b>suspension</b> system is performed in order to show the feasibility of the approach.

The work was done by studying one steering performance parameter, namely forces in the steering rack under a simulated driving condition.

The thesis is especially discussing how to make sure that results can be trusted and that they can be used in real life engineering applications. This is found to be a subject of both loading and boundary condition definitions, as well as choice of optimization algorithms and general approach. The thesis begins with an elaboration of basic topology optimization theory; discussing topology optimization history, mathematical algorithms, available software and general workflow when performing topology optimization. In particular, the widely used SIMP-algorithm and the MinMax approach are elaborated, as well as proposing solution strategies for obtaining suitable results, depending on the desired properties. The thesis further discusses the use of Abaqus ATOM for optimizing the two test cases, evaluating previously stated optimization solution strategies as well as manually performing multidisciplinary topology optimization on the Door Connection Joint. A process description of the NX topology optimization module is also included. Simulation results from minimizing volume and constraining displacements suggest geometries that for the Door Connection Joint and the FLCA are 11. 2 % and 6. 41 % lighter than the original parts, respectively.

40|$|The current paper {{deals with}} the elastic and stress {{analysis}} of a side-load spring, which is employed in cars belonging to the medium segment of the European automotive market. In the design {{of this kind of}} spring both the elastic characteristics and the fatigue strength have to be considered as significant aspects. Side-load springs, indeed, have a thrust axis which results in skew with respect to the damper axis; for this reason they are widely employed in front <b>McPherson</b> automotive <b>suspensions</b> in order to minimize the side force acting on the strut damper, which is responsible for the undesired damper-sticking phenomenon. In addition to this particular elastic property, {{as a consequence of the}} research effort in reducing the mass of components typical of the automotive industry, these springs have to face very high working stresses. The structural reliability of the spring must therefore be ensured by high residual stresses, which are induced by presetting and shot peening treatment at the end of the manufacturing process. The evolution of the thrust axis during suspension travel was analysed by a finite element (FE) model of the spring–seats assembly, built starting from a three-dimensional (3 D) scan of the spring. In addition an experimental campaign was planned in order to measure the residual stresses at several points along the spring by X-ray diffraction. The actual stresses were then obtained as the superposition of those produced by the external loads, computed by means of the FE model, and the measured residual stresses. The beneficial effect of residual stresses on the structural reliability is discussed with a theoretical fatigue analysis on the basis of different multiaxial criteria. A mechanism of residual stress generation, based on the superposition of stresses coming from presetting and shot peening, is also suggested with the aid of FE simulations...|$|R
