50|$|<b>Muzolimine</b> is a High-ceiling loop diuretic. It is a {{pyrazole}} diuretic {{which was}} used for treatment of hypertension but was withdrawn worldwide because of severe neurological side effects.|$|E
40|$|<b>Muzolimine</b> was {{administered}} by mouth to 24 patients with creatinine clearances ranging from 4 to 28 ml/min to treat oedema or hypertension, or both. In {{four of these}} 24 patients <b>muzolimine</b> was given after intravenous high-dose frusemide had been unsuccessful. <b>Muzolimine</b> significantly increased urine volume and excretions of sodium, chloride, and potassium ions. Its diuretic efficacy was further shown by a mean reduction in body-weight of 8 % and by the disappearance of oedema in all affected patients, even those refractory to intravenous frusemide. No rebound phenomenon was observed after the drug was stopped. Mean blood pressure was reduced in all hypertensive patients. Blood pressure was restored to normal in five out of seven patients treated with <b>muzolimine</b> alone and 10 out of 11 in whom <b>muzolimine</b> had been added to previously unsatisfactory antihypertensive treatment. <b>Muzolimine</b> was well tolerated by all patients. <b>Muzolimine</b> {{appears to be the}} diuretic of choice when treating patients with advanced renal disease...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{short-term}} {{studies of}} <b>muzolimine</b> (a diuretic with frusemide-like activity) {{had shown that}} it did not induce a significant change in the serum potassium concentration. In the present study sodium and potassium handling and other metabolic variables have been compared during 16 weeks of therapy with <b>muzolimine</b> and chlorthalidone, a thiazide-like diuretic. During <b>muzolimine</b> treatment, plasma and red cell potassium concentrations remained unchanged, while a significant fall in potassium occurred with chlorthalidone. Neither drug affected the activity of sodium-potassium cotransport or sodium-lithium countertransport in red cells in vitro. <b>Muzolimine</b> and chlorthalidone had similar effects on arterial pressure and on the other metabolic variables tested...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{determine}} the possible interrelation between <b>muzolimine</b> and the renal PG and renin-angiotensin systems by direct assay of these renal hormones. 4 groups of five rats were subdivided as follows: Group 1 : controls; Group 2 : rats treated with <b>muzolimine</b> (100 mg/kg); Group 3 : rats treated with indomethacin (4 mg/kg); Group 4 : rats treated with both <b>muzolimine</b> and indomethacin. After 3 days, the rats were transferred to metabolic cages, urine and plasma samples were taken on the 4 th day and the following parameters assayed: Urine: creatinine, Na+, PGE 2. Plasma: PRA and aldosterone. Results and conclusions: Muzolimine: 1) increase PRA (11. 8 +/- 1. 06 vs. 8. 66 +/- 1. 56 AI ng/ml/h - p less than 0. 01) and 2) increases PGE 2 release (7. 08 +/- 3. 22 vs. 0. 6 +/- 0. 19 micrograms/mg urine creatinine - p less than 0. 005). PG synthesis-inhibition (indomethacin) lowers (0. 118 +/- 0. 056 mmol Na+/mg urine creatinine of group 2 vs 0. 043 +/- 0. 019 mmol Na+/mg urine creatinine of group 4 - p less than 0. 025) although not completely abolishes (0. 043 +/- 0. 019 nmol Na+/mg urine creatinine of group 4 vs. 0. 019 +/- 0. 006 mmol Na+/mg of group 3 - p less than 0. 05) the natriuretic effect of <b>muzolimine.</b> This suggests that the natriuretic activity of the drug, at least in part, depends on PGE 2 production...|$|E
40|$|Thirty {{patients}} with {{moderate to severe}} hypertension (diastolic blood pressure {{greater than or equal}} to 115 mmHg), after a run-in wash out period of 15 days, were treated with <b>muzolimine</b> at a dosage of 20 mg once daily, given at 1 p. m., for three weeks. At the end of this period of treatment the {{patients with}} diastolic blood pressure {{greater than or equal to}} 100 mmHg started a double blind randomized study of comparison of nitrendipine, a vasodilator calcium antagonist agent, and captopril, an inhibitor of converting enzyme. The dosage was 10 mg twice daily for nitrendipine and 25 mg twice daily for captopril, the duration of each treatment being four weeks. At the end of 28 days of double blind treatment, the patients with diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 100 mmHg were treated with a triple combination: <b>muzolimine</b> plus nitrendipine plus captopril at the same dosage for a further four weeks. At the end of run-in and of each period of treatment blood pressure and heart rate were recorded in supine and erect positions and after a treadmill exercise test. At these times laboratory tests, including PRA and aldosterone, were performed. After the run-in period supine blood pressure was 189. 6 +/- 13. 9 / 123. 1 +/- 7. 7 mmHg. At the end of <b>muzolimine</b> treatment, supine blood pressure was 176. 5 +/- 10. 8 / 117. 8 +/- 5. 6 mmHg (p less than 0. 001); at this time 4 patients had their diastolic blood pressure normalized and left the study. Thus 26 patients were randomized for comparative study. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|Thiazide {{therapy is}} a widely used first line {{treatment}} for arterial hypertension. Its useful value, particularly in mild or moderate hypertension, is sometimes reduced by metabolic side-effects, as hypokalaemia and hyperuricaemia. In the present study the antihypertensive efficacy of a new, non-sulphonamide diuretic Bay g 2821 (<b>muzolimine)</b> was evaluated {{in comparison with the}} combination of hydrochlorothiazide-amiloride over a period of 4 weeks. A highly significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressures was produced by both treatments. No decrease in serum potassium nor an increase in cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid or glucose was detected during the 4 week treatment period. Subjective side-effects, such as headache and dizziness, were very rarely observed during Bay g 2821 treatment. The new diuretic appears, therefore, to be effective in the treatment of arterial hypertension without untoward side-effects...|$|E
