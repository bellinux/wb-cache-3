The sink sends the AP {{containing}} hop count, and then the nodes one hop away from the specific sink calculate their own depth by adding 1 to the depth value in the AP packet. And so, other nodes also obtain their own depth by receiving AP message from their neighbors, which already have a depth in the same path as the nodes one hop away. The proposed algorithm will recalculate the depth when it detects the topological changes.

40|$|Abstract. The aims of {{this study}} were to {{estimate}} the proportion of asymptomatic Kenyan preschool children using anti-malarial drugs, to identify factors associated with chloroquine use, and to assess the validity of frequency of febrile episodes and drug use reported by mothers or carers. Of 318 children studied, 38 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 5 30 – 47 %]) tested positive for chloroquine or sulfadoxine. Of chloroquine-positive children, 15 % had concen-trations exceeding the estimated <b>minimum</b> therapeutically <b>effective</b> <b>values.</b> Among those testing negative for sulfa-doxine, chloroquine-positive children were more frequently parasitemic (odds ratio 5 2. 6, 95 % CI 5 1. 3 – 5. 2), and had lower mean hemoglobin concentrations (6. 1 g/L, 95 % CI 5 2. 1 – 10. 1) than chloroquine-negative children. Mothers over-reported the frequency of malaria or fever episodes as usually defined in medical studies, and underreported anti-malarial drug use. We conclude that anti-malarials are frequently given for treatment of malaria or malaria-associated illness, rather than prophylactically or for symptoms unrelated to malaria. Questionnaire surveys cannot replace biochemical markers to obtain information on anti-malarial drug use. In developing countries, drugs are often used without pre-scription. They may be purchased from local shops, markets, or street vendors, obtained by sharing with other users, or used when left over from previous treatments. Home treat...|$|R

40|$|Background: Clinicians need to {{know the}} right antipsy-chotic dose for {{optimized}} treatment, and the concept of dose equivalence is important for many clinical and scien-tific purposes. Methods: We refined a method presented in 2003, which was based on the <b>minimum</b> <b>effective</b> doses found in fixed-dose studies. We operationalized the selec-tion process, updated the original findings, and expanded them by systematically searching more recent literature and by including 13 second-generation antipsychotics. To qualify for the <b>minimum</b> <b>effective</b> dose, a dose had to be significantly more efficacious than placebo in the pri-mary outcome of at least one randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose trial. In a sensitivity analysis, 2 positive trials were required. The <b>minimum</b> <b>effective</b> doses identified were subsequently used to derive olanzapine, risperidone, haloperidol, and chlorpromazine equivalents. Results: We reviewed 73 included studies.

40|$|AbstractBackground and objectiveThe use of {{ultrasound}} for needle correct {{placement and}} local anesthetic spread monitoring helped {{to reduce the}} volume of local anesthetic required for peripheral nerve blocks. There are few studies of the <b>minimum</b> <b>effective</b> volume of local anesthetic for axillary brachial plexus block. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the <b>minimum</b> <b>effective</b> volume (VE 90) of 0. 5 % bupivacaine with epinephrine (1 : 200, 000) for ultrasound guided ABPB. MethodMassey and Dixon's up-and-down method was used to calculate the <b>minimum</b> <b>effective</b> volume. The initial dose was 5 mL per nerve (radial, median, ulnar, and musculocutaneous). In case of blockade failure, the volume was increased to 0. 5 mL per nerve. A successful blockade resulted in decreased volume of 0. 5 mL per nerve to the next patient. Successful blockade was defined as a motor block ≤ 2, according to the modified Bromage scale; lack of thermal sensitivity; and response to pinprick. The achievement of five cases of failure followed by success cases was defined as criterion to complete the study. Results 19 patients were included in the study. The <b>minimum</b> <b>effective</b> volume (VE 90) of 0. 5 % bupivacaine with 1 : 200, 000 epinephrine was 1. 56 mL (95 % CI, 0. 99 – 3. 5) per nerve.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether bedtime administration and a low cholesterol diet reduce the <b>minimum</b> <b>effective</b> dose of chenodeoxycholic (chenic) acid, defined as the dose giving a mean cholesterol saturation index of 0. 8. Dose response studies were carried out in 10 patients with radiolucent gallstones in a functioning gallbladder during three different treatment regimens. On each regimen, all patients received three different doses of chenodeoxycholic acid in random order for one month each. Bedtime chenic acid plus a low cholesterol diet gave the greatest reduction in saturation index. A significant dose/response relationship was found on each regimen. On the conventional regimen of mealtime chenic acid, the <b>minimum</b> <b>effective</b> dose was 14 mg/kg/day; on bedtime chenic acid it was 12. 4 mg/kg/day; and on bedtime chenic acid plus low cholesterol diet it was further reduced to 8. 4 mg/kg/day (p less than 0. 01). There was a dose-related increase in bowel frequency, which was absent at 10. 6 mg/kg/day and below. We conclude that administration of chenic acid at bedtime with a low cholesterol diet enables the <b>minimum</b> <b>effective</b> dose for gallstone dissolution to be approximately halved, thus preventing diarrhoea and reducing the cost of treatment...|$|R
