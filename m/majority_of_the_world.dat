5|$|In the 1950s, Hedley Marston's {{research}} into nuclear {{fallout from the}} Maralinga nuclear tests brought Marston into bitter conflict with the Australian government appointed Atomic Weapons Tests Safety Committee. He was vindicated posthumously by the McClelland Royal Commission, which found that significant radiation hazards existed at many of the Maralinga test sites long after the tests. His project tracked fallout across the continent by examining the thyroids of sheep and cattle as well as devices that filtered radioactive elements from air. Later the results, which showed dramatic increases of certain radioactive elements after British Nuclear Tests, caused a further, controversial study where the bones of deceased people (especially children) were burnt to ash and then measured for strontium-90. These tests showed that the tests had increased the concentration of strontium-90 dramatically. As well as finding this after British tests a notable 50% increase was noticed one year {{when there were no}} tests and it was cited as evidence that the previous year's hydrogen bomb tests had contaminated the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
5|$|Zoran Lazarević is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. He is voiced by Graham McTavish. He is a homicidal Serbian terrorist. The <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> believes he is dead after a bombing, but he survives with half of his face scarred. Lazarevic pays Flynn to betray Drake, tricking him into giving Flynn information on the location of Marco Polo's lost fleet and causing Drake's arrest. In reality, Lazarevic wants to possess the mythic Cintamani Stone, which the fleet was supposedly transporting. He discovers that the fleet never had the stone, and dispatches a group of mercenaries to Nepal for clues {{to the location of}} the legendary city of Shambhala. He incites a civil war in the region to aid in his search and distract from any possible discovery. In Nepal, Lazarevic personally executes Fisher's cameraman Jeff, and follows Drake after he discovers the location of Shambhala's entrance. Lazarevic invades the small Tibetan village harboring Drake and Elena, seeking the key to reveal Shambhala. He kidnaps Schäfer and forces him to reveal the general area of the entrance. When Drake and Fisher follow, Lazarevic apprehends them and forces Drake to reveal the entrance to Shambhala. There, he drinks the sap of the Cintamani Stone, which is made of the sap of the Tree of Life. He battles Drake with his newfound powers, but is defeated by Drake and beaten by the guardians of Shambhala and assumingly killed when the temple falls apart. He appears later along with Harry Flynn and Eddy Raja in the online co-op story in Uncharted 3. Lazarevic uses a pump-action shotgun as his main weapon.|$|E

25|$|The Industrial Revolutions {{were major}} technological, socioeconomic, and {{cultural}} changes in late 18th and early 19th centuries {{that began in}} Britain and spread throughout the world. The effects spread throughout Western Europe and North America during the 19th century, eventually affecting the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> The impact of this change on society was enormous and is often compared to the Neolithic revolution, when mankind developed agriculture and gave up its nomadic lifestyle.|$|E
25|$|Low {{wages in}} {{absolute}} terms and low wages relative to men's wages in the aggregate, however, do not provide a full picture of gender economic equity. The ratio of income for women to men for equal work is another significant financial indicator of economic gender equality. Using this metric, these countries, collectively, are moderately equal relative to the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> The World Economic Forum's 2012 Gender Report found that women in Iran, Turkey, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia all received approximately 60% of the wages of a male for the same work.|$|E

Other smaller events were regularly held in locations {{not part of the}} championship, such as the Syracuse and Danish Grands Prix, although these only attracted a small amount of the championship teams and relied on private entries and lower Formula cars to make up the grid. These became less common through the 1970s and 1983 saw the last non-championship Formula One race; the 1983 Race of Champions at Brands Hatch, won by reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg in a Williams-Cosworth in a close fight with American Danny Sullivan.|$|E

500|$|Judaic {{criticism}} of Jesus is long-standing. The Talmud, written and compiled from the 3rd to the 5th century AD, includes stories that since medieval times {{have been considered}} to be defamatory accounts of Jesus. In one such story, Yeshu HaNozri ("Jesus the Christian"), a lewd apostate, is executed by the Jewish high court for spreading idolatry and practicing magic. The majority of contemporary scholars consider that this material provides no information on the historical Jesus. The Mishneh Torah, a late 12thcentury work of Jewish law written by Moses Maimonides, states that Jesus is a [...] "stumbling block" [...] who makes [...] "the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> to err and serve a god other than the Lord".|$|E

2500|$|Some {{fundamentalist}} critics believe GCE might undermine {{religious education}} and promote secular values.

Dill, for example, claims that [...] "the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> experiences social and communal life not in terms of isolated individuals, but as collective identities and traditions. For many of these groups, the dominant forms of global citizenship education and its moral order will be experienced as coercive and unjust', so 'global' citizenship curriculum should be seen as a local practice, [...] "which diverse cultures will conceptualize and construct differently".|$|E

60|$|And {{here the}} author must beg {{it to be}} remembered that Mr. Slope was not in all things a bad man. His motives, like those of most men, were mixed, and though his conduct was {{generally}} {{very different from that}} which we would wish to praise, it was actuated perhaps as often as that of the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> by a desire to do his duty. He believed in the religion which he taught, harsh, unpalatable, uncharitable as that religion was. He believed those whom he wished to get under his hoof, the Grantlys and Gwynnes of the church, to be the enemies of that religion. He believed himself to be a pillar of strength, destined to do great things, and with that subtle, selfish, ambiguous sophistry to which the minds of all men are so subject, he had taught himself to think that in doing much for the promotion of his own interests, he was doing much also for the promotion of religion. But Mr. Slope had never been an immoral man. Indeed, he had resisted temptations to immorality with a strength of purpose that was creditable to him. He had early in life devoted himself to works which were not compatible with the ordinary pleasures of youth, and he had abandoned such pleasures not without a struggle. It must therefore be conceived that he did not admit to himself that he warmly admired the beauty of a married woman without heart-felt stings of conscience; and to pacify that conscience he had to teach himself that the nature of his admiration was innocent.|$|E

I'd as soon desire to have it proved that my mother could drink brandy, chew tobacco, and swear, by way of {{satisfying}} me that I did right in doing the same. It wouldn't make me at all more satisfied with these things in myself, {{and it would take}} from me the comfort of respecting her; and it really is a comfort, in this world, to have anything one can respect. In short, you see," [...] said he, suddenly resuming his gay tone, [...] "all I want is that different things be kept in different boxes. The whole frame-work of society, both in Europe and America, is made up of various things which will not stand the scrutiny of any very ideal standard of morality. It's pretty generally understood that men don't aspire after the absolute right, but only to do about as well {{as the rest of the}} world. Now, when any one speaks up, like a man, and says slavery is necessary to us, we can't get along without it, we should be beggared if we give it up, and, of course, we mean to hold on to it,--this is strong, clear, well-defined language; it has the respectability of truth to it; and, if we may judge by their practice, the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> will bear us out in it.
