No.5 left with 41 aboard, No.3 had 32 aboard, No.8 left with 39 and No.1 left with just 12 out of a capacity of 40. The evacuation did not go smoothly and passengers suffered accidents and injuries as it progressed. One woman fell between lifeboat No.10 and the side of the ship but someone caught her by the ankle and hauled her back onto the promenade deck, where she made a second successful attempt at boarding. First-class passenger Annie Stengel broke several ribs when an overweight German-American doctor and his brother jumped into No.5, squashing her and knocking her unconscious. The lifeboats' descent was likewise risky. No.6 was nearly flooded during the descent by water discharging out of the ship's side, but successfully made it away from the ship. No.3 came close to disaster when, for a time, one of the davits jammed, threatening to pitch the passengers out of the lifeboat and into the sea.|$|E
2500|$|Mr Rendell , engineer, deposed that he {{constructed}} the present steam ferry boats or bridges at the Hamoaze. These were worked by chains, which extended to either shore; and when wind and tide was strong, the chains formed {{a species of}} arc, and the platform [...] was not {{at right angles with}} the landing place. Considerable difficulty would therefore arise in bringing the rails of the bridge so immediately in contact with the rails of the landing place, [...] that the trains might easily and safely run on and off the bridge; besides that, a difficulty arose from the great fall in the tide, which at spring was no less than 18feet. [...] was of opinion that by a train being stopped, divided, and placed upon the steam bridge, and landed {{on the opposite side of}} the Hamoaze, tackled together, and put in motion, a great delay would be occasioned, independent of the seven or eight minutes in crossing, of from eight to twelve <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E

[...] This {{was also one of the}} details which Chuck felt to be unique to the time and recording of the album. [...] "Once hip-hop became corporate, they took the daredevil out of the artistry. But being a daredevil was what Hank brought to the table." [...] It was decided amongst the group that the album should be exactly one hour long, thirty <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side.</b> At the time, audio cassettes were more popular than CD's and the group didn't want listeners having to hear dead air for a long time after one-half of the album was finished. The two sides of the album were originally the other way around, the album beginning with [...] "Show Em Whatcha Got" [...] which leads into [...] "She Watch Channel Zero?!". This instead became the start of side two or the [...] "Black Side". Hank Shocklee decided to flip the sides just before the mastering of the album and start the record with Dave Pearce introducing the group during their first tour of England.|$|E

50|$|In 1939 the {{standard}} {{way to make}} an audio recording of a live radio broadcast was by cutting a instantaneous transcription disc, since audio tape recording {{had not yet been}} perfected. The typical disc used in this situation was a double-sided 16-inch (41 cm.) platter which could record approximately fifteen <b>minutes</b> of audio <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side.</b> A major advantage of cutting an instantaneous disc, as opposed to making a record, was that the disc did not need any further processing to be playable, although unlike a finished record this disc was so soft it would wear out after a few plays. By late 1939 transcription discs were being used fairly commonly in the industry, even though the networks still aired the majority of their programs live. However many performers and sponsors were using transcription discs to record their own shows, thus allowing them to later review their programs. And NBC's nighttime series Information Please had just begun recording its shows onto instantaneous discs so that the program could be re-aired later that night on the West Coast.|$|R

50|$|Tubular Bells is {{the debut}} album by English {{musician}} Mike Oldfield, released on Virgin Records on 25 May 1973. Apart from occasional vocal contributions, {{the album is}} essentially an instrumental record, consisting of two musical compositions in excess of twenty <b>minutes</b> <b>each,</b> one <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> of the original vinyl release. It is notable {{for the fact that}} Oldfield, only 19 years old when it was recorded, played almost every instrument on the album himself. Tubular Bells was also the first release on the Virgin label and its success played an important part in the company's subsequent growth. Although sales of the album during its first few months were slow, it gained global attention when its introduction was used briefly but memorably on the soundtrack to the Academy Award-winning film The Exorcist which was released in North America in December 1973 and in the UK three months later. The album became a worldwide success during 1974, reaching number one in the UK, Australia and Canada, and number three on the US Billboard 200. It ended the decade as the third best-selling album of the 1970s in the UK.|$|R
5000|$|Standard 16 inch {{transcription}} discs of the 1930s and 1940s usually held about 15 <b>minutes</b> {{of audio}} <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> {{but this was}} occasionally pushed {{to as much as}} 20 minutes. Unlike ordinary records, some were recorded inside out, with the start of the recording near the label and the end {{near the edge of the}} disc. The label usually noted whether the disc was [...] "outside start" [...] or [...] "inside start". If there was no such notation, an outside start was assumed. Beginning in the mid-1950s, some transcription discs started employing the [...] "microgroove" [...] groove dimensions used by the 12 and 10 inch 33 1/3 rpm vinyl LP records introduced for home use in 1948. This allowed 30 minutes to fit comfortably <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> of a 16-inch disc. These later discs can be played with an ordinary modern stylus or a vintage [...] "LP" [...] stylus. The earlier discs used a larger groove, nearer in size to the groove of a typical 78 rpm shellac record. Using a [...] "78" [...] stylus to play these [...] "standard groove" [...] discs usually produces much better results, and also insures against the groove damage that can be caused by the point of a too-small stylus skating around in the groove and scoring its surface. Some specialist audio transfer engineers keep a series of custom-ground styli of intermediate sizes and briefly test-play the disc with each in order to find the one that produces the best possible results.|$|R
5000|$|Strange as It Seems was a {{radio program}} of strange and unusual tales about fantastic people and events, {{based on the}} daily {{syndicated}} newspaper cartoon panels of John Hix of the same name. Strange as It Seems began as a 15-minute radio program on March 22, 1935. It was broadcast over the Columbia - Don Lee Coast radio network. The schedule was 3 nights a week - Sunday, Wednesday and Friday at 7:45 PM (6:45 during summer daylight saving time). The sponsor was Ex‐Lax. In late September 1935 the show changed to two shows per week, dropping the Sunday show. In late September 1936 the schedule changed again to Tuesday and Friday nights. A 1936 booklet of the Strange as It Seems stories was sponsored by Ex-Lax and given away as a free promotion of the radio program by writing to the station. The show was hosted by Gayne Whitman, produced and directed by Cyril Armbrister and the music was composed and directed by Felix Mills. Whitman had been the announcer on the Strange as It Seems movie shorts from 1930-1934. The programs included two or three segments of dramatized events in mini plays with dramatic, fanfare music interspersed in the show between segments. After the opening line, an Ex-Lax commercial would follow. Then two or three strange stories would be presented. The show would conclude with {{a preview of the}} next show's stories, an Ex-Lax commercial, a strange fact of trivia, such as [...] "butterflies smell with their feet" [...] and finally a short musical ending. There were occasionally live interviews with unusual personalities, such as the World's Fastest Talker. Many of the programs were distributed on 16" [...] 33 RPM records with one 15 <b>minute</b> show <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side.</b> Many sources list at least 39 of these records with a total of 78 programs recorded. This run of the shows concluded at the end of January 1937, after over 210 shows. The show began again in January 1938 as a 15-minute once a week program, airing on Sunday afternoons at 3:00 (2:00 during daylight saving time). The show ended at the end of December 1938, with 53 shows in this run.|$|R

Bay leaf may be used, along with chopped carrot to give extra sweetness. The seared chicken parts are returned to the pan which is then covered. The dish is done after about an hour at a very low simmer. Cacciatore is often served with a rustic bread or pasta on the side.|$|E

5000|$|Before {{the early}} 1950s, when radio {{networks}} and local stations wanted {{to preserve a}} live broadcast, they did so by means of special phonograph records known as [...] "electrical transcriptions" [...] (ETs), made by cutting a sound-modulated groove into a blank disc. At first, in the early 1930s, the blanks varied in both size and composition, but most often they were simply bare aluminum and the groove was indented rather than cut. Typically, these very early recordings were not made by the network or radio station, but by a private recording service contracted by the broadcast sponsor {{or one of the}} performers. The bare aluminum discs were typically 10 or 12 inches in diameter and recorded at the then-standard speed of 78 rpm, which meant that several disc sides were required to accommodate even a 15-minute program. By about 1936, 16-inch aluminum-based discs coated with cellulose nitrate lacquer, commonly known as acetates and recorded at a speed of 33 rpm, had been adopted by the networks and individual radio stations as the standard medium for recording broadcasts. The making of such recordings, at least for some purposes, then became routine. Some discs were recorded using a [...] "hill and dale" [...] vertically modulated groove, rather than the [...] "lateral" [...] side-to-side modulation found on the records being made for home use at that time. The large slow-speed discs could easily contain fifteen <b>minutes</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> allowing an hour-long program to be recorded on only two discs. The lacquer was softer than shellac or vinyl and wore more rapidly, allowing only a few playbacks with the heavy pickups and steel needles then in use before deterioration became audible.|$|E
