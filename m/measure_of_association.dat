50|$|Like many {{commonly}} used statistics, the sample statistic r is not robust, so its value {{can be misleading}} if outliers are present. Specifically, the PMCC is neither distributionally robust, nor outlier resistant (see Robust statistics#Definition). Inspection of the scatterplot between X and Y will typically reveal a situation where lack of robustness might be an issue, and in such cases it may be advisable to use a robust <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>association.</b> Note however that while most robust estimators of association measure statistical dependence in some way, they are generally not interpretable on the same scale as the Pearson correlation coefficient.|$|E
5000|$|In {{terms of}} its {{algebraic}} form, Fisher's original ICC is the ICC that most resembles the Pearson correlation coefficient. One key {{difference between the two}} statistics is that in the ICC, the data are centered and scaled using a pooled mean and standard deviation, whereas in the Pearson correlation, each variable is centered and scaled by its own mean and standard deviation. This pooled scaling for the ICC makes sense because all measurements are of the same quantity (albeit on units in different groups). For example, in a paired data set where each [...] "pair" [...] is a single measurement made for each of two units (e.g., weighing each twin in a pair of identical twins) rather than two different measurements for a single unit (e.g., measuring height and weight for each individual), the ICC is a more natural <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>association</b> than Pearson's correlation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this paper}} is to compare {{different}} methods for automatic ex-traction <b>of</b> semantic similarity <b>measures</b> from corpora. The semantic similarity measure is proven to be very useful for many tasks in natural language processing like information retrieval, information extraction, machine translation etc. Additionally, one of the main problems in natural language processing is data sparseness since no language sample is large enough to seize all possible language combinations. In our research we experiment with four different <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>association</b> with context and eight different <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> vector similarity. The results show that the Jensen-Shannon divergence and L 1 and L 2 norm outperform other <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> vector similarity regardless <b>of</b> the <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> associ-ation with context used.

50|$|There is a {{difference}} between these measurements which involves measures of activation vs. measures of association. Measures of association are involved with the Implicit Association Task and Semantic priming. This is a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>association</b> because they are normally given choices and they are measured based on the association between them and the choices in the task. What they choose is associated to their previous experience because they are usually choosing between a pair; or more choices. However measures of activation which includes word completion and unprimed lexical decision tasks are both associated with activating the implicit stereotype. This means that although the person that is being involved in the research may not be aware what they are being measured on, they are measured based on the activation of a stereotype at that time. This can also be associated with previous experiences but can change previous thoughts based on the activation of potentially new implicit stereotypes.|$|E
