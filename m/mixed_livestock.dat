40|$|Prior {{research}} has divided the Lake Titicaca basin into four agroecological zones based on climate: Lakeside, Suni A, Suni B, and Dry Puna. The authors hypothesize that these climatic differences result in differences in farming systems {{and natural resource}} exploitation. The validity of distinguishing among these four agroecological zones is tested statistically with farm and natural resource data from a 1999 survey of 265 farms in ten villages of Puno, Peru. Analyses include pairwise comparisons of individual variables using t-tests and chi-square tests, as well as {{multivariate analysis of variance}} for groups of re-lated variables. On examining farming practices (including crop <b>mix,</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>mix,</b> soil fertility, crop pests, crop rotations and labor time), farm resources (field size, field position in landscape, cropped area and livestock inventory), and natural resource use (forest use, aquatic plant use and cooking fuel), the authors find that the agroecological zones do, in fact, differ significantly. Now that the zonal typology has been validated, it can be applied in development and diffusion of suitable technologies {{as well as in the}} design of locally suitable natural resource policies...|$|R
40|$|As {{calls for}} bolstering {{environmental}} services on croplands {{have grown more}} insistent {{during the past two}} decades, the search for ways to foster sustainable, reduced input agriculture has become more urgent. In this context we re-examine by means of a meta-analysis the argument, first proposed by Robert McC. Netting, that small scale, <b>mixed</b> crop – <b>livestock</b> farming, a common livelihood among poor rural peoples, encourages environmentally sustainable agricultural practices. As predicted, <b>mixed</b> crop – <b>livestock</b> farms exhibit more sustainable practices, but, contrary to predictions, a small scale of operation does not predict sustainability. Unsustainable practices occur on small farms characterized by degrading, input scarce agriculture and on large farms characterized by industrialized, high chemical input agriculture. Sustainable practices occur on small farms that <b>mix</b> crops with <b>livestock</b> production, and they occur on large farms characterized by minimum tillage. The strength and pervasiveness of the link between mixed crop –livestock farming and sustainable agricultural practices in both developed and developing countries argues for agricultural policies that promote <b>mixed</b> crop – <b>livestock</b> livelihoods.

No other poultry is raised in significant numbers in New Zealand. Approximately 3.1 million laying hens are kept, producing 900 million eggs in 2006.

Manitoba has a combination of mixed grain, livestock, and mixed farming industries in its southernmost areas. Cattle ranching around Lake Manitoba is also quite successful. Northern Manitoba consists of extensive lakes and forested geographical areas.The Dominion Land Act of 1872 offered agricultural pioneers an opportunity to [...] "prove up" [...] a quarter section of land (160 acres/65 hectares) in western Canada for a $10.00 filing fee and three years of improvements combined with residence on the land.

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{estimate}} the rate by which inputs in Australian pig production are substituted for one another when prices change. It employs a dual approach to response analysis. Using cost shares of inputs and input price indexes for the period 1977 - 78 to 1990 - 91, a set of equations derived from a transcendental logarithmic function is estimated with symmetry and homogeneity constraints imposed. The results indicate that, {{with the exception of}} the demand for feed which is a vital production input, pig producers are very responsive to own price changes. The estimated elasticities generally differ in magnitude from similar studies of the Australian agricultural sector, and suggest that, at a lower level of aggregation, farmers are more flexible in changing input <b>mix.</b> <b>Livestock</b> Production/Industries,...|$|R

30|$|Climate {{change is}} {{expected}} to impact drylands in significant but varied ways. Barnes et al.

The conclusion is even more remarkable given that the economic analysis only looked at classic products (meat, milk, tourism) and did not add other ecosystem services that would have tipped the results even more in favour of extensive systems.|$|E

40|$|A Monte Carlo {{procedure}} {{is used to}} demonstrate the dangers of basing (farm) risk programming on only a few states of nature and to study the impact of applying alternative risk programming methods. Two risk programming formulations are considered, namely mean-variance (E,V) programming and utility efficient (UE) programming. For the particular example of a Norwegian <b>mixed</b> <b>livestock</b> and crop farm, the programming solution is unstable with few states, although the cost of picking a sub-optimal plan declines with increases in number of states. Comparing the E,V results with the UE results shows that there were few discrepancies between the two and the differences which do occur are mainly trivial, thus both methods gave unreliable results in cases with small samples...|$|E
30|$|Having fewer {{animals is}} {{expected}} to reduce the impact of livestock on the environment. However, although improved cattle breeds have higher market values, they {{have been found to}} be less resistant to droughts and floods than local breeds and require more veterinary and fodder inputs (Nkedianye et al. 2011). There is also no evidence that the adoption of more productive breeds necessarily translates into people keeping fewer animals (Marshall 2014). Conservancy cattle management plans are influenced by commercial ranching models, and many are based on experience and expert opinion from ranchers and land managers in other <b>mixed</b> <b>livestock</b> and wildlife areas in Kenya. This implies a change to many of the long-term traditional and customary practices of livestock grazing and management in the area.|$|E

40|$|<b>Mixed</b> <b>livestock</b> {{production}} {{with some}} arable cropping is the description often taken as applying {{to the form}} of agriculture practised throughout Ireland, {{with little or no}} reference to the major regional variations in the emphases placed on different farming enterprises which are such a striking feature of the agricultural scene.

It was not only due to the weakness of agricultural marketing policy, but also lack of research, particularly research related to the costumer’s attitude of marketing mix. Understanding of costumer’s attitude of marketing mix was really important. Many literatures indicated {{that one of the}} advantages of this was to design the marketing mix strategy. The main purposes of this study were, first, to evaluate the customer’s attitude toward marketing mix among distinct market segments of livestock input industry, and second, to examine the influence of demographic variables on customer attitude toward marketing mix. The methodology used in this study was survey method through distribute of questionnaire to respondents. Respondent of this study was poultry livestock farmer who have used company feed product and kept livestock in Java Island, Indonesia. The findings of this study revealed that, first, the three market segments were perceived differently and second, there was no significance difference among various demographic variables. This finding showed the importance of market segmentation to determine the appropriate strategy.
