5|$|On 24 January 2000, {{the part}} of the {{radiation}} therapy unit containing the radiation source was acquired by two scrap collectors, who claimed to have bought it from some strangers as scrap metal for resale. They took it home, planning to dismantle it later. On 1 February, the two, together with another two associates, attempted to dismantle the metal part (a 97-kilogram, 42-by-20-centimetre lead cylinder held in a stainless steel casing), which was the unit's source drawer. Using a hammer and chisel, they only managed to crack the welded seam. Two of the men then took the <b>metal</b> <b>piece,</b> along with other scrap metal, to a scrapyard on Soi Wat Mahawong in Phra Pradaeng District, Samut Prakan Province. There they asked a worker at the scrapyard to cut open the cylinder using an oxyacetylene torch. As the cylinder was cut open, two smaller cylindrical metal pieces, which had held the source capsule, fell out. The worker retrieved the two pieces and kept them in the scrapyard, but was unaware of the source capsule itself. The lead cylinder was returned to the scrap collectors for them to complete the disassembly.|$|E

50|$|The manual {{laboratory}} {{scissor jack}} works mechanically {{by having a}} central screw connected to the central <b>piece</b> of <b>metal</b> between two layers of crossing <b>metal</b> <b>pieces.</b> The screw performs the same task as screws in hydraulic car lift, supporting the <b>metal</b> <b>pieces</b> in withstanding the oppressing weight. Turning the screw increases and decreases the angle between the <b>metal</b> <b>pieces,</b> resulting in extension and contraction of the platform height.|$|R

25|$|After a <b>metal</b> <b>piece</b> {{is ground}} to an initial finish, it is {{superfinished}} with a finer grit solid abrasive. The abrasive is oscillated or rotated while the workpiece is rotated {{in the opposite}} direction; these motions are what causes the cross-hatching. The geometry of the abrasive depends on the geometry of the workpiece surface; a stone (rectangular shape) is for cylindrical surfaces and cups and wheels are used for flat and spherical surfaces. A lubricant is used to minimize heat production, which can alter the metallurgical properties, and to carry away the swarf; kerosene is a common lubricant.|$|E
25|$|Shell mold casting is a {{metal casting}} process similar to sand casting, in that molten metal is poured into an {{expendable}} mold. However, in shell mold casting, the mold is a thin-walled shell created from applying a sand-resin mixture around a pattern. The pattern, a <b>metal</b> <b>piece</b> {{in the shape}} of the desired part, is reused to form multiple shell molds. A reusable pattern allows for higher production rates, while the disposable molds enable complex geometries to be cast. Shell mold casting requires the use of a metal pattern, oven, sand-resin mixture, dump box, and molten metal.|$|E
500|$|An {{abutment}} {{is selected}} {{depending on the}} application. In many single crown and fixed partial denture scenarios (bridgework), custom abutments are used. An impression {{of the top of}} the implant is made [...] with the adjacent teeth and gingiva. A dental lab then simultaneously fabricates an abutment and crown. The abutment is seated on the implant, a screw passes through the abutment to secure it to an internal thread on the implant (lag-screw). There are variations on this, such as when the abutment and implant body are one piece or when a stock (prefabricated) abutment is used. Custom abutments can be made by hand, as a cast <b>metal</b> <b>piece</b> or custom milled from metal or zirconia, all of which have similar success rates.|$|E
