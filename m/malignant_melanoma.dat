5|$|In {{addition}} {{to breast cancer}} in men and women, mutations in BRCA2 also lead to {{an increased risk of}} ovarian, Fallopian tube, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, as well as <b>malignant</b> <b>melanoma.</b> In some studies, mutations in {{the central part of the}} gene have been associated with a higher risk of ovarian cancer and a lower risk of prostate cancer than mutations in other parts of the gene. Several other types of cancer have also been seen in certain families with BRCA2 mutations.|$|E
5|$|In July 1977, Marley {{was found}} to have a type of <b>malignant</b> <b>melanoma</b> under the nail of a toe. Contrary to urban legend, this lesion was not {{primarily}} caused by an injury during a football match that year, but was instead a symptom of the already-existing cancer. Marley turned down his doctors' advice to have his toe amputated (which would have hindered his performing career), citing his religious beliefs, and instead the nail and nail bed were removed and a skin graft taken from his thigh to cover the area. Despite his illness, he continued touring and {{was in the process of}} scheduling a world tour in 1980.|$|E

40|$|Primary <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas</b> of uterine cervix {{are quite}} rarely seen neoplasms, and {{long-life}} {{prognosis of patients}} with this disease is poor. Immunohistochemical methods and exclusion of other primary melanoma sites are used to confirm the diagnosis. As with other <b>melanomas,</b> cervix <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas</b> may also cause cardiac metastases. Cardiac metastases are among rarely seen but more commonly encountered cases, compared to primary cardiac tumors. Here, we present a case of biatrial cardiac metastases in a 73 -year-old patient with uterine cervix <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas.</b> The patient underwent echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography. Our report shows the importance of advanced diagnostic techniques, such as cardiac magnetic resonance, not only for the detection of cardiac masses, but for a better anatomic definition and tissue characterization. Although the cases of <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas</b> leading to multiple cardiac metastasis were reported in literature, the metastatic concurrence of <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas</b> in both right and left atriums is quite rarely encountered as metastatic <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas.</b> Also, another intriguing point in our case is that the primary lesion of our case was stemmed from uterine cervix, but not skin...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF) and cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) in melanomas and the expressive difference of VEGF and COX- 2 between melanomas with and without vasculogenic mimicry(VM). METHODS Sixty cases of <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas</b> embedded in paraffin were studied. The tumors were divided into a high-grade malignant group and a low-grade malignant group based on their tumor type, atypia and survival time of the patient. Then tissue microarrays were produced from these paraffin-embedded tumor tissues which were stained for VEGF, COX- 2 and PAS. The difference in expression between VEGF and COX- 2 in the <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas</b> was compared using a grid-count. In addition, the tumors were also divided into mimicry and non-mimicry groups based on their PAS staining. Then {{the differences between the}} PAS positive and negative areas of the 2 groups were compared. RESULTS In <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas</b> with VM, VEGF and COX- 2 expression was less in tumors in which VM was absent, but VEGF, C 9 expression in high-grade <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas</b> was higher than that in low-grade grade <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas.</b> Expression of VEGF was correlated with COX- 2 expression. CONCLUSION VM exists in some high-grade <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas.</b> The differences and relations between VEGF and COX- 2 showed that some high-grade <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas</b> possess a unique molecular-mechanism of tumor metastasis and blood supply...|$|R
5|$|Robson met Elsie Gray on a {{trip back}} to his parents' home in Langley Park. She was a student nurse, and later a teacher. They were married in June 1955 and Fulham {{teammate}} Tom Wilson was Robson's best man. After 1991, Robson was repeatedly diagnosed as suffering from cancer. He had several operations and, in 2006, was operated on for a brain tumour. This, on occasion, affected his work; while at Porto, for example, Robson suffered from <b>malignant</b> <b>melanoma,</b> which resulted in his missing {{the first few months}} of the 1995–96 season.|$|E
5|$|In early 2008, he was {{diagnosed}} with <b>malignant</b> <b>melanoma,</b> a severe form of skin cancer. He had fought the disease before, when he had a form of skin cancer removed from his back in 2006. Cooksey suspected his cancer originated from a six-month spell coaching schoolchildren in the searing heat of Las Vegas in the United States. In April 2008, Grays Athletic staged a benefit match for Cooksey. The match consisted of former professional players, as well as current professionals such as Leroy Lita, Nicky Shorey, Aaron McLean, Ray Parlour, Justin Edinburgh, Iain Dowie, Bob Dowie, Clive Allen, Scott Fitzgerald and Paul Merson. He returned to his former club Oldham Athletic in May 2008, where another benefit match was staged for his appeal at Boundary Park, attended by 1,500 fans to see such former players as John Barnes, Luther Blissett and Chris Waddle as well as television actors from Coronation Street.|$|E
5|$|Robson {{defeated}} bowel {{cancer in}} 1992, a <b>malignant</b> <b>melanoma</b> in 1995, and a tumour {{in his right}} lung and a brain tumour, both in 2006. Treatment of these conditions had left him partially paralysed due to a stroke caused by the brain tumour, and also with a partially prosthetic upper jaw after the melanoma was surgically removed. His fifth diagnosis of cancer in 2007, consisting of cancerous nodules in both lungs, was diagnosed as terminal in February 2007, and as of December 2008, was being controlled through bouts of chemotherapy. After these experiences, and following his fifth diagnosis with cancer, Robson devoted the remaining {{years of his life}} to helping fight the disease. On 25 March 2008, he launched the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation. By November 2008, the Foundation had raised £1million. The money raised by the Foundation funded equipment for the Sir Bobby Robson Cancer Trials Research Centre, in the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne, and would go on to fund other cancer projects in the North East of England.|$|E

40|$|Cathepsin D is an aspartic {{lysosomal}} endopeptidase {{present in}} most mammalian cells. Overexpression of cathepsin D {{is associated with}} the progression of several human cancers including melanoma. We examined the expression levels of cathepsin D in 20 primary <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas,</b> 20 metastatic <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas,</b> 20 benign nevus pigmentosus and 10 normal skin samples in Japanese. In normal skin, granular or dotted pattern of positive staining was observed along the granular layer of epidermis and hair follicle with apparent moderate to strong staining in sebaceous and eccrine glands. The percent positivity and staining intensity of cathepsin D in primary and metastatic <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas</b> were significantly higher than that of nevus pigmentosus. Moreover, the expression levels of cathepsin D in metastatic <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas</b> were significantly higher than those of primary <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas.</b> Data from our and previous reports strongly supports a notion that the upregulation of cathepsin D may be critically involved in the malignant transformation and progression of melanocytic tumors. カテプシンDはリソゾーム内に存在するエンドペプチダーゼであるが, 胃癌, 乳癌, 卵巣癌などでは周辺正常組織に比べ, 過剰発現していることが知られている. 悪性黒色腫においても, その過剰発現が 2 編の文献報告で知られているが, 日本人を対象とした検討は行われていない. 我々は, 20 例の原発性悪性黒色腫, 20 例の転移性悪性黒色腫, 20 例の良性色素細胞母班, 10 例の健常皮膚を用いて, カテプシンD の発現を免疫組織学的に検討した. 正常皮膚では, カテプシンDは表皮および毛囊の上層・顆粒層に顆粒状に発現しており, 脂腺やエクリン汗腺では強い発現を認めた. 原発性悪性黒色腫や転移性悪性黒色腫のカテプシンDの発現は, 良性色素細胞母班のそれよりも有意に上昇していた. また転移性悪性黒色腫では, 原発性悪性黒色腫よりも有意に高い発現が認められた. これらの結果から, カテプシンDの発現は色素細胞の悪性化と腫瘍進展に関与していると考えられた...|$|R

40|$|Factor XIIIa-positive dendrocytes {{present at}} the {{periphery}} and inside epithelial neoplasms are an heterogeneous group of cells. They are subsets of mesenchymal cells, cancer-associated macrophages and antigen-presenting cells. Factor XIIIa, other tissue transglutaminases, alpha 2 -macroglobulin and tumour necrosis factor-alpha represent a complex network of mediators influencing tumour progression in the skin. In the present study we searched {{for the presence of}} dendrocytes and alpha 2 -macroglobulin deposits inside and in the vicinity of cutaneous carcinomas (90 basal cell carcinomas and 46 squamous cell carcinomas) and <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas</b> (69 primary and 28 metastatic tumours). We also studied the proliferation of the same neoplasms by Ki- 67 immunohistochemistry. Dendrocytes were numerous, abutting on and infiltrating most basal cell carcinomas and thin <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas.</b> In contrast, they were present in only low numbers or even absent in thick primary <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas</b> and in their metastases. They appeared unmodified around squamous cell carcinomas compared with the surrounding skin. Extracellular deposits of alpha 2 -macroglobulin were often found in locations where dermal dendrocytes were numerous. No correlation was found between the Ki- 67 indices of carcinomas and the density of peritumoral dendrocytes. In contrast, negative relationships were found between the Ki- 67 indices and the number of dendrocytes present inside basal cell carcinomas and thin <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas.</b> This study has yielded circumstantial evidence to link the density of factor XIIIa-positive dendritic cells and a low proliferative rate of neoplastic cells in basal cell carcinomas and <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R

25|$|Another form of skin cancer, <b>malignant</b> <b>melanoma,</b> is {{much less}} common but far more dangerous, being lethal in about 15–20 {{percent of the cases}} diagnosed. The {{relationship}} between <b>malignant</b> <b>melanoma</b> and ultraviolet exposure is not yet fully understood, but it appears that both UVB and UVA are involved. Because of this uncertainty, it is difficult to estimate the effect of ozone depletion on melanoma incidence. One study showed that a 10 percent increase in UVB radiation was associated with a 19 percent increase in melanomas for men and 16 percent for women. A study of people in Punta Arenas, at the southern tip of Chile, showed a 56 percent increase in melanoma and a 46 percent increase in nonmelanoma skin cancer over a period of seven years, along with decreased ozone and increased UVB levels.|$|E

40|$|Melanomas develop due to {{malignant}} {{transformation of}} melanocytes, which {{are derived from}} the neuroectoderm. Although the majority of melanomas are cutaneous, they occasionally arise from extra-cutaneous tissues as well which contain melanocytes, such as uvea, leptomeninges, or the mucosa. Melanomas can be melanotic or amelanotic. Approximately, 15 - 20 % of all <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas</b> arise in head and neck region and over 80 % of these involve the skin. Mucosal <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas</b> are very rare and may affect the upper aero-digestive tract (UADT). Their incidence is approximately as low as 0. 5 - 3 % of all <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas.</b> Majority of noncutaneous head and neck <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas</b> affect the ocular origin and only 6 - 8 % originate in the mucous membranes of the UADT.

25|$|The {{most deadly}} form of skin cancer, <b>malignant</b> <b>melanoma,</b> is mostly caused by DNA damage {{independent}} from UVA radiation.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the ability of metastatic cells to produce the macrophage cytokine, TNF-alpha/cachectin, as these cells have macrophage-like properties such as infiltration and migration.

All the tumor cells in both the co-cultivated <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas</b> and their in vitro tumorous nodules produced TNF alpha/cachectin, even those derived from the melanoma cell line, which originally did not. The results clearly show that TNF-alpha/cachectin can be produced by non-hematopoetic tumor cells.

40|$|A {{total of}} 62 canine melanocytic tumours (10 melanocytomas and 52 primary <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas)</b> were {{investigated}} {{to compare the}} accuracy of prognosis provided by MIB- 1 proliferation index (MIB- 1 -PI) with classical histological criteria and location. MIB- 1 -PI was assessed by means of quantitative image analysis of sections immunostained with MIB- 1 monoclonal antibody. Tumour location, histological cell type, stromal or lymphatic vessel invasion, maximum tumour thickness, and presence of inflammation or necrosis were recorded for each case. Thirty-eight dogs were submitted to a 1 -year follow-up and the clinical outcome of the disease determined. MIB- 1 -PI in melanocytomas differed significantly from that detected in primary <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas</b> (P = 0. 0001). A significant difference in MIB- 1 -PI was revealed between oral and cutaneous <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas</b> (P = 0. 015), and between presence and absence of lymphatic vessel invasion (P = 0. 05).

40|$|MMPs play a {{significant}} role in the progression of different types of human tumors as well as <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas.</b> MMP- 2, which is also known as 72 -kD type IV collagenase is a member of MMPs. The aim of this immunohistochemical study is to evaluate the role of MMP- 2 expression in common melanocytic nevi, dysplastic nevi and primary cutaneous <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas.</b> Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded materials from 21 common melanocytic nevi (CMN), 42 dysplastic nevi (DN) and 18 primary cutaneous <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas</b> (MM) were examined. Standard streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was used for immunostaining with MMP- 2 antibody. Both tumoral and stromal cytoplasmic MMP- 2 expressions in melanocytic lesions were scored semiquantitatively. MMP- 2 immunoreactivity was not observed in stromal and/or melanocytic cells in either common melanocytic or dysplastic nevi. Eleven of 18 <b>malignant</b> <b>melanomas</b> expressed MMP- 2. Five cases showed positive cytoplasmic staining only in stromal cells, and six cases in both stromal and melanocytic cells. MMP- 2 was more commonly expressed at the tumor-stroma interface where significant amount of plasma cells and lymphocytes were observed. MMP- 2 expression does not appear to be related to the pathobiology of benign melanocytic lesions such as common melanocytic nevi and dysplastic nevi. On the other hand, MMP- 2 expression by the cells in the tumor stroma, particularly by endothelial cells and fibroblasts, may play {{a significant}} role in melanoma pathobiology...|$|R
