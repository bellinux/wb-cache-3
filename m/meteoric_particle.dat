A magnetic effect on meteor train diffusion has been observed in underdense meteors by using a backscatter radar, with a 40 kW pulsed transmitter operating at 26. 36 MHz. Echo heights were measured with a spaced interferometer. The observed magnetic effect is consistent with that expected from the formation of electron and ion ellipses of ionization. Other results recorded when anisotropic, ambipolar diffusion is more likely do not show this effect. Previous observations, limited to overdense meteors, are shown to be consistent with theoretical predictions and the expected magnetic effects on diffusion for general train orientations are discussed. Phase variations caused by Fresnel diffraction as meteor trains are formed have been studied and shown to be a cause of systematic decreases in echo heights (during the lifetime of an echo) measured with spaced antennas.

40|$|A {{reexamination of}} the results of the Pioneer 10 and 11 Asteroid Meteoroid Detector, or Sisyphus, was carried out in the light of a {{recently}} derived theory characterizing interplanetary matter and the Zodiacal Light (ZL). Sisyphus measured individual meteoroids from reflected sunlight and ZL between meteoroid events. The results were questioned because meteoroid orbits could not be calculated as intended and the ZL as computed from individual meteoroids did not agree with values determined from the ZL mode and from the other ZL sensor on the spacecraft. It is first shown that, independent of any explanation, the measurements are, with high probability, valid and strongly correlated with the ZL. The model which explains the strange behavior of the Sisyphus instrument also resolves the enigma why the three dust experiments on the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft produced extreme disparate results for the distribution and orbits of <b>meteoric</b> <b>particles</b> and the ZL. The theory based primarily on these measurements requires a population in the inner solar system of cold meteoroid material composed mainly of volatile molecules.

The dispersed particles, predominantly micron sized, scatter most of the ZL and supply the polarization. The sublimation time in sunlight for micron sized particles of volatile composition opposes the gravitational flux increase expected in approaching the sun.

40|$|The Earth's {{mesosphere}} {{and lower}} thermosphere in the altitude range 50 - 130 km {{is a fascinating}} part of our atmosphere. Complex interactions between radiative, dynamical, microphysical and chemical processes give rise to several prominent phenomena, many of those centred around the mesopause region (80 - 100 km). These phenomena include noctilucent clouds, polar mesosphere summer echoes, the ablation and transformation of meteoric material, and the Earth’s airglow. Strong stratification and small scale interactions are common features of both these phenomena and the mesopause region in general. In order to study interactions on the relevant spatial scales, in situ measurements from sounding rockets are essential for mesospheric research. This thesis presents new measurement techniques and analysis methods for sounding rockets, thus helping to improve our understanding of this remote part of the atmosphere. Considering the need to perform measurements at typical rocket speeds of 1 km/s, particular challenges arise both from the design of selective, sensitive, well-calibrated instruments and from perturbations due to aerodynamic influences. This thesis includes a quantitative aerodynamic analysis of impact and sampling techniques for <b>meteoric</b> <b>particles,</b> revealing a distinct size discrimination due to the particle flow.

According to this hypothesis, the lines arise from collisional heat of the <b>meteoric</b> <b>particles,</b> and require the nebular line to be fluted (extended or shaded like molecular bands-the likely molecular band at this wavelength is that of MgO). Even before Naegamvala’s observations, others, notably Huggins, Vogeland, and James Keeler at Lick showed the lines to be sharp, {{there was still a}} major controversy. As Osterbrock says [...] "although Keeler’s paper convinced most of his contemporaries, Lockyer and his partisans could not accept the result, and {{at a meeting of the}} Royal Astronomical Society on 8 May 1891, with neither Huggins nor Lockyer present, an argument welled up.

Captain William Noble, a friend and partisan of Huggins, rose and smoothly congratulated Naegamvala, through the Secretary who had read the paper."

40|$|Meteors with peak {{magnitudes}} fainter than + 2 {{are typically}} called faint meteors, {{resulting from the}} atmospheric entry and ablation of meteoroids less massive than 10 - 4 kg. The processes of luminous wake formation and fragmentation, which occur during ablation, are poorly understood for faint meteors, and are important constraints for models of meteoroid structure. The goal of this work is to improve understanding of these processes through analysis of high-resolution intensified video observations, and creation of a detailed meteoroid ablation model. In {{the first part of}} this work, thirty faint meteors observed with the Canadian Automated Meteor Observatory (CAMO) are analysed, revealing meteor trails with widths up to 100 m at heights above 110 km. These widths vary with height as the inverse of the atmospheric density, suggesting that formation of the wake is related to collisions between evaporated meteoric atoms and atmospheric molecules. Next, nine fragmenting faint meteors captured with CAMO are examined. Fragments from eight of the nine meteors are found to have transverse speeds up to 100 m s- 1. These speeds are not explained by aerodynamic separation theory typically used for brighter meteors that fragment at lower heights. Instead, fragment separation by rotational breakup of the meteoroid or electrostatic repulsion are considered, giving meteoroid strength estimates up to 1 MPa. These strengths are typical of meteorite-producing meteoroids and are larger than expected for small meteoroids. Finally, a single-body ablation model, based on modelling collisions between the meteoroid, meteoric atoms, and atmospheric molecules, is devised to explain wake formation. Synthetic meteor trail widths and lengths, as well as light curves and deceleration profiles, are compared to observations of nine meteors from {{the first part of this}} thesis. The widths of simulated meteor wakes show good agreement with observations, but simulated wake lengths are too short. This suggests that collisional de-excitation of <b>meteoric</b> <b>particles</b> is a plausible process for wake formation, but also that meteoroid fragmentation likely increases the length of the meteor wake. Compared to observations, simulated light curves are longer, and simulated meteoroids experience less deceleration, suggesting that meteoroid fragmentation should be investigated in the next iteration of the model...|$|R

In {{this work}} {{we present a}} {{detailed}} investigation of the possible connections between near-Earth objects and meteoroid streams. In particular, we specifically explore the possibility that at least {{a fraction of the}} meteor showers observed on Earth originate from truly asteroidal parent bodies, where the formation and ejection of <b>meteoric</b> <b>particles</b> in the stream is caused by a process different from classical cometary outgassing. We first present the results of our search for possible progenitors of known meteor showers in the population of near-Earth asteroids, identifying a few dozen likely associations of streams with asteroidal bodies, and verifying the most promising ones with accurate dynamical ejection models. This list of possible linkages forms the basis for a specific observational effort, where we target a significant fraction of these proposed parent bodies with the goal of separating truly asteroidal ones from inactive cometary nuclei. The observations we collected allow us to identify at least a few truly asteroidal (rocky) objects embedded in well-established meteoroid streams. We also extend our observational investigation directly to the streams, attempting to detect them both in the optical wavelength range from the ground and in the thermal infrared via satellite observations. Although no large meteoroids or thermal signatures of streams could be detected, we are able to use the information to place meaningful constraints on the stream populations. Finally, we present the interesting and unexpected results of a detailed dynamical analysis of very small asteroids, in the size range of a few meters in diameter that directly compares with larger meteoroids. Our observations allow us to measure an unexpectedly low bulk density for most of these objects, which casts a new light on the possible role of asteroids as meteor stream progenitors, but also have very relevant implications for the field of impact hazard mitigation and future spacecraft exploration. We conclude our work with a summary of the information obtained from the various components of project, with a discussion of a possible coherent scenario capable of explaining the various results we obtained, and with possible future directions of this investigation...|$|R
30|$|The {{mechanism}} of PMWE generation is still unknown; however, a few hypotheses have been proposed. Lübken et al. (2006) suggested {{that at least}} some PMWE can be explained by layered neutral turbulence excited by wind shear. Rapp et al. (2011) using the MAARSY radar in multi-beam experiment showed a relation of PMWE with gravity wave breaking that generates turbulence. In contrast, Stebel et al. (2004) and Belova et al. (2005) claimed that turbulence alone cannot account for the observed echo strength. It was suggested that small charged dust particles are involved (Kirkwood et al. 2002, 2006 a, 2015). The presence of such dust, probably <b>meteoric</b> smoke <b>particles,</b> during PMWE has been confirmed in so-called heating—overshoot experiments, where the ionosphere is modified by a powerful RF-wave from the ground (Belova et al. 2008; La Hoz and Havnes 2008). High-speed horizontal movement of the scattering location reported by Kirkwood et al. (2006 b) in relation with strong PMWE have evoked a hypothesis of their non-turbulent origin involving infrasound waves coming from below and probably originated from ocean swell (Le Pichon et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|Several {{possible}} {{mechanisms for}} the production of sporadic sodium layers have been discussed in the literature, but none of them seem to explain all the accumulated observations. The hypotheses range from direct meteoric input, to energetic electron bombardment on <b>meteoric</b> smoke <b>particles,</b> to ion neutralization, to temperature dependent chemistry. The varied instrumentation located on Andoya and near Tromso in Norway gives us an opportunity to test the different theories applied to high latitude sporadic sodium layers. We use the ALOMAR Weber sodium lidar to monitor the appearance and characteristics of a sporadic sodium layer that was observed on 5 November 2005. We also monitor the temperature to test the hypotheses regarding a temperature dependent mechanism. The EISCAT Tromso Dynasonde, the ALOMAR/UiO All-sky camera and the SKiYMET meteor radar on Andoya are used to test the suggested relationships of sporadic sodium layers and sporadic E-layers, electron precipitation, and meteor deposition during this event. We find that more than one candidate is eligible to explain our observation of the sporadic sodium layer...|$|R
40|$|Nanometre CaO {{and pure}} carbon smoke {{particles}} were collected at 38 -km altitude {{in the upper}} stratosphere in the Arctic during June 2008 using DUSTER (Dust in the Upper Stratosphere Tracking Experiment and Retrieval). This balloon-borne instrument was designed for non-destructive collection of solid particles between 200 nm to 40 &#x 00 B 5;m. We report here on micrometre CaCO 3 (calcite) grains with evidence of thermal erosion and smoke particles that formed after melting and vaporisation and complete dissociation {{of some of the}} CaCO 3 grains at temperatures of approximately 3500 K. These conditions and processes suggest that the environment of this dust was a dense dust cloud that had formed after disintegration of a carbonaceous meteoroid during deceleration in the atmosphere. The balloon-borne collector must have coincidentally travelled through the dust cloud of a recent bolide event that had penetrated between 38. 5 and 37 km altitude. This work identified a previously unknown meteoric smoke forming process in addition to <b>meteoric</b> smoke <b>particles</b> due to photolysis-driven oxidation of mesospheric metals from meteor ablation that had settled into the upper stratosphere...|$|R
