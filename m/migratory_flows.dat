40|$|Based on {{the crime}} {{economics}} of Becker (1968) and Ehrlich (1973), including {{the impact of the}} <b>migratory</b> <b>flow,</b> this paper studies the reasons why some individuals choose to strategically, rationally, and contingently become involved in illegal land invasion "para-institutions" in Cali since the 1950 s. This will be done by modeling the efficiency of justice in order to discourage invaders through simulations of sentences and arrest likelihood and deterrent punishment under three "para-institutions": invasive dynasty, organized invasion and contingent invasion (endogenous <b>migratory</b> <b>flow.)</b> These simulations will be anchored to calibrated actual parameters of the relevant population. This will allow the calibration of the line of indifference (division) among individuals with invasive (and incentives to illegality) and non-invasive behaviors. Finally, a policy proposal will be devised to help correct the inefficiencies found in the sanctioning mechanisms, if applicable...|$|R
25|$|Moreover, the Vili, {{as opposed}} to the Yombe people, are less {{attached}} to the land because of their commercial vocation and their positioning as intermediaries between the populations of the hinterland and the European traffickers.

50|$|In {{subsequent}} years the <b>migratory</b> <b>flow</b> {{to the region}} of Marabá increased considerably. During the 1920s, immigrants moved to Maraba mainly {{to participate in the}} extraction and sale of Brazil nuts, andiroba, copaiba oils and rubber.

50|$|Since {{the late}} 1960s the Italian <b>migratory</b> <b>flow</b> towards Australia ceased. At present, the Italian Australian {{community}} is numerically stable and well settled. The Australian Census of 1971 indicated over 289,000 people born in Italy, gradually decreasing to about 254,000 in the 1991 Census. Hence, the progressive aging process {{of its population}} is {{an indicator of the}} lack of turnover with new arrays of migrants from Italy.|$|R
40|$|The present {{analysis}} {{compares the}} distribution of surnames by means of spatial autocorrelation analysis in the Spain–Portugal border region. The Spanish National Institute of Statistics provides a database of surnames of residents in the western Spanish provinces of Zamora, Salamanca, Cáceres, Badajoz and Huelva. The Spanish and Portuguese patterns of surname distribution were established according to various geographic axes. The results obtained show a low diversity of surnames in this region – especially in the centre – which {{can be explained by}} the absence of any major geographic barriers, with the exception of the mountain ranges between hydrographic basins, and by the presence of traditional roads that have existed since Roman times. The latter have resulted in a constant <b>migratory</b> <b>flow</b> over short–median distances, which, as can be deduced from the surnames, fits two north/south territorial axes running parallel to the border between Spain and Portugal. The distribution patterns of Portuguese and Spanish surnames differ with regard to their frequencies in the five provinces studied, which can be attributed to their respective historical, economic and social conditions. It is concluded that the border delimiting these two countries has affected the <b>migratory</b> <b>flow,</b> thereby conditioning the demographic and genetic structure of the western Spanish regions...|$|R
25|$|The {{industrial}} revolution changed a mainly rural society into an urban one, {{but with a}} strong contrast between northern and southern Belgium. During the Middle Ages and the Early Modern Period, Flanders was characterised {{by the presence of}} large urban centres (...) {{at the beginning of the}} nineteenth century this region (Flanders), with an urbanisation degree of more than 30 per cent, remained one of the most urbanised in the world. By comparison, this proportion reached only 17 per cent in Wallonia, barely 10 per cent in most West European countries, 16 per cent in France and 25 per cent in Britain. Nineteenth century industrialisation did not affect the traditional urban infrastructure, except in Ghent (...) Also, in Wallonia the traditional urban network was largely unaffected by the industrialisation process, even though the proportion of city-dwellers rose from 17 to 45 per cent between 1831 and 1910. Especially in the Haine, Sambre and Meuse valleys, between the Borinage and Liège, where there was a huge industrial development based on coal-mining and iron-making, urbanisation was fast. During these eighty years the number of municipalities with more than 5,000 inhabitants increased from only 21 to more than one hundred, concentrating nearly half of the Walloon population in this region. Nevertheless, industrialisation remained quite traditional in the sense that it did not lead to the growth of modern and large urban centres, but to a conurbation of industrial villages and towns developed around a coal-mine or a factory. Communication routes between these small centres only became populated later and created a much less dense urban morphology than, for instance, the area around Liège where the old town was there to direct <b>migratory</b> <b>flows.</b>|$|E

By {{the end of}} the 19th century {{and the beginning of the}} 20th one, the <b>migratory</b> <b>flow</b> went overseas, to the Americas, especially to Argentina and Cuba, from where emigrants kept their influence in the municipality. A proof of that are the very important money transferences they made and which allowed the construction of different buildings, as well as their promoting of the education of the remaining youth in Boal. All this flow of money was interrupted by the Cuban revolution.|$|R

25|$|For long periods, {{urban areas}} such as Buenos Aires, Rosario, and Córdoba welcomed European {{immigrants}}, including, above all, those of Italian and Spanish descent. Nevertheless, {{there was also a}} <b>migratory</b> <b>flow</b> of German, Swiss, and Middle-Eastern immigrants arriving in Argentina. Among the countless changes this melting pot brought was the enrichment of the culinary art. Dishes such as pasta, pizza, pucheros (stews), croquetas (fritter)s, sauces, embutidos (sausages), and chicken and meat courses brought a wider scope of options to daily menus. Furthermore, the bread-making, dessert, pastry, and dairy industries have achieved considerable development in this region.|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the largely neglected post- 1990 Romanianimmigration to Canada. During the 1990 s, most Romanians selected by Canadian immigration offices were highly skilled, university-educated professionals. As they ignored important details of the Canadian labor market, about three quarters of them became kindof lumpen-intellectuals. In recent years, however, Internet-based networks have improved the quality of information available to potential migrants. This and structural changes in the home country are preparing a major shift of Romanians' <b>migratory</b> <b>flow</b> to Canada.
