5|$|Barbados is the easternmost of {{the islands}} located within the Caribbean Sea. Home to 280,000 residents, Barbados was first settled by the British in the 1620s. The nation {{remained}} a British colony until it declared total independence from the United Kingdom in 1966. The first appearance of a uniquely Barbadian delegation at the Olympic games came two years after it declared independence. At its debut, nine <b>male</b> <b>athletes</b> arrived to participate at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. Previously, Barbados (as a British colony) constituted {{a major part of}} the West Indies Federation along with Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, which sent a delegation to participate at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Eleven <b>male</b> <b>athletes</b> {{competed in}} track and field events on behalf of the Bahamas. Of those athletes, three participated in the 4×400 meters relay only (Williams, Moncur, Miller); five participated only in events other than the 4×400 meters relay (Atkins, Rolle, L. Sands, S. Sands, and Thomas), and three participated in both an {{individual}} event and the 4×400 meters relay. Of the individual events, Bahamian athletes were involved in six distinct events (100 meters, 40 meters, 200 meters, triple jump, 110 meters hurdles, and high jump). The two Bahamian medals won at Beijing were won by men {{in track and}} field events (4×400 meters relay and triple jump).|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} male over-representation {{in terms of}} total number of sports and athletes is structural. In the United Kingdom, for example, more <b>male</b> <b>athletes</b> than female ones receive {{financial}} support. Sports officials rationalise this uneven distribution by claiming {{that there are more}} opportunities for men to win at the highest level than there are for women. The importance of being part of the Summer Olympics is illustrated by softball, and the benefits the sport derived from its inclusion. This included additional media coverage, especially during Olympic years. Olympic recognition plays an important part in getting sponsorship for local competitions around the world and providing new opportunities for females.|$|E

5|$|The men's hammer throw {{became an}} Olympic event in 1900 but the women's event – using a 4kg (8.82lb) weight – was not widely competed until much later, finally {{featuring}} on the women's Olympic programme in 2000. The distances thrown by <b>male</b> <b>athletes</b> became greater from the 1950s onwards {{as a result}} of improved equipment using the denser metals, a switch to concrete throwing areas, and more advanced training techniques. Professional hammer throwers as historically large, strong, sturdy athletes. However, qualities such as refined technique, speed and flexibility have become increasingly important in the modern era as the legal throwing area has been reduced from 90 to 34.92 degrees and throwing technique involves three to four controlled rotations.|$|E
