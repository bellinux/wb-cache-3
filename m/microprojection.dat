40|$|The barrier {{morphology}} of skin provides major obstacles for {{the application}} of siRNA for gene silencing, which current delivery technologies do not effectively overcome. Emerging technologies utilise <b>microprojection</b> array devices to penetrate into the skin epidermis and dermis for delivery of drug payloads. Delivery of siRNA by such devices has been proven in principle, yet requires optimisation for clinical applications. Herein, we demonstrate the use of Nanopatch頭icroprojection arrays to deliver liposome-encapsulated siRNA to overcome skin barrier, and in vivo siRNA delivery hurdles. This application provided effective silencing of CXCL 1 expression induced by the co-delivery of Fluvax 2012 y <b>microprojection</b> array. Liposomes encapsulating siRNA were dry-coated onto <b>microprojection</b> arrays, and remained intact after elution from arrays in vitro. <b>Microprojection</b> arrays facilitated the delivery of fluorescently-labelled nucleic acids through murine ear stratum corneum to the epidermis and dermis, with diffusion from microprojections into adjacent skin evident within 30 s. CXCL 1 mRNA, induced by delivery of Fluvax by <b>microprojection</b> array, was reduced by 75 % up to 20 h post-treatment by co-delivery of liposome-encapsulated CXCL 1 -specific siRNA, but not by arrays co-delivering liposome-encapsulated control siRNA. CXCL 1 protein expression in explant cultures from skin treated with arrays bearing CXCL 1 specific or control siRNA was similarly reduced. These results as a test case have many implications for gene silencing in skin and inflammation, with the benefit of targeted delivery using <b>microprojection</b> arrays to deliver liposome-encapsulated siRNA.

40|$|Purpose. We {{evaluated}} the Macroflux <b>microprojection</b> array patch technology as a novel system for intracutaneous delivery of protein antigens. Methods. Macroflux <b>microprojection</b> array systems (330 -m micro-projection length, 190 microprojections/cm 2, 1 - and 2 -cm 2 area) were {{coated with a}} model protein antigen, ovalbumin (OVA), to produce a dry-film coating. After system application, <b>microprojection</b> penetra-tion depth, OVA delivery, and comparative immune responses were evaluated in a hairless guinea pig model. Results. Macroflux microprojections penetrated into hairless guinea pig skin at an average depth of 100 m with no projections deeper than 300 m. Doses of 1 to 80 g of OVA were delivered via 1 - or 2 -cm 2 systems by varying the coating solution concentration and wearing time. Delivery rates were as high as 20 g in 5 s. In a prime and boost dose immune response study, OVA-coated Macroflux was most comparable to equivalent doses injected intradermally. Higher antibody titers were observed when OVA was administered with the <b>microprojection</b> array or intradermally at low doses (1 and 5 g). Macroflux administration at 1 - and 5 -g doses gave immune responses up to 50 -fold greater than that observed after the same subcutaneous or intramuscular dose. Dry coating an adjuvant, glu-cosaminyl muramyl dipeptide, with OVA on the Macroflux resulted in augmented antibody responses. Conclusions. Macroflux skin patch technology provides rapid and reproducible intracutaneous administration of dry-coated antigen. The depth of skin penetration targets skin immune cells; the quantity of antigen delivered can be controlled by formulation, patch wearing time, and system size. This novel needle-free patch technology may ultimately have broad applications {{for a wide variety}} of therapeutic vaccines to improve efficacy and convenience of use.

In our initial work on <b>Microprojection</b> arrays, carbodiimide chemistry was used to immobilize biomarker-specific probes for affinity capture in vivo using a mouse model. However, as the observed capture efficiencies were relatively low, with significant variation across the surface, here we investigated the surface modifications to (a) determine {{the source of the}} variability and (b) find ways of improving capture efficiency. We found the protein immobilization step accounted for almost all of the variability in surface uniformity. Varying the protein immobilization conditions following a standard carbodiimide activation process resulted in a reduction in overall variation 14 -fold and an increase in captured biomarker amount 18 -fold. In conclusion, we found that investigating and optimizing the surface chemistry of <b>microprojection</b> array devices led to drastic improvements in capturing biomarkers from skin fluid...|$|E

These devices are gold coated silicon arrays with > 20, 000 projections per cm(2), which {{can be applied to}} the skin for tunable penetration into the epidermis or dermis. The <b>microprojection</b> array conceptually offers several advantages over the current methods including: minimally invasive sample collection, no need for sample processing and concentration of specific markers at the device surface for sensitive detection. In this study, <b>Microprojection</b> arrays were coated with antibodies to capture an early marker of dengue virus infection, NS 1, from the skin of live mice. We also developed a complementary "total IgG" assay which could be used as a positive control for adequate penetration of the projections.

We also investigated the use of Protein G-mediated antibody immobilization in order to orient capture antibodies. While we found that capture efficiency could be improved, the direct EDC-based antibody immobilization resulted in a significantly higher surface density leading to a higher degree of NS 1 capture.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that cellular microprojections (microvilli and/or microplicae) of the corneal surface {{are essential to}} maintain the functionality of the tissue. To date, the characterization of these vital structures has been made by analysing scanning or transmission electron microscopy images of the cornea by methods that are intrinsically subjective and imprecise (qualitative or semiquantitative methods). In the present study, numerical data concerning three <b>microprojection</b> features were obtained by an automated method and analysed to establish which of them showed less variability. We propose that the most stable <b>microprojection</b> characteristic would be a useful sign in early detection of epithelial damage or disease. With this aim, the scanning electron microscopy images of 220 corneal epithelial cells of nine rabbits were subjected to several image processing techniques to quantify <b>microprojection</b> density, <b>microprojection</b> average size and surface covered by microprojections (SCM).

Our results show that the thresholding process, the basis of all image processing techniques used in this work, is highly reliable in separating microprojections {{from the rest of the}} cell membrane. Assessment of histogram information from thresholded images is a good method to quantify SCM. Amongst the three studied variables, SCM was the most stable (with a coefficient of variation of 15. 24 %), as 89. 09 % of the sample cells had SCM values ≥ 40 %.

40|$|Densely packed dry-coated <b>microprojections</b> {{are shown}} to deliver {{vaccines}} to targeted locations within the skin that {{are rich in}} immune cells, thus inducing protective immune responses against a lethal virus challenge. Selectively limiting the antigen coating to {{the tips of the}} projections, which penetrate the skin, would significantly reduce the amount of vaccine required in immunization. In this paper a simple technique, dip-coating the <b>microprojections,</b> is introduced to meet this goal. By increasing the coating solution viscosity, an otherwise strong capillary action is mitigated and the desired controlled coating length on projections is achieved. Following application to the skin, most of the coated vaccine material is rapidly released from the projections (82. 6 % in mass within 2 min) to the target locations within the skin strata and a potent immune response is induced when a conventional influenza vaccine (Fluvax) is tested in a mouse model. The utility of this coating approach to a variety of molecules representative of vaccines (e. g., chicken egg ovalbumin (OVA) protein, DNA, and fluorescent dyes) is demonstrated. These collective attributes, together with the simplicity of the approach, position the dip-coating method for practical utility in large vaccination campaigns...|$|R

Success in this targeted vaccine delivery relies on overcoming the challenges of dry-coating the vaccine onto the very small (≤ 90 µm length) and densely packed (~ 20, 000 cm− 2) MPs. In this paper, we show that a gas-jet drying coating method achieves the desired uniform coating. The coating approach is robustly demonstrated on compounds representative {{of a range of}} immunotherapeutics (e. g. DNA, proteins), with each uniformly coated on thousands of MPs. Furthermore, the dry-coating remains intact during skin insertion, and then releases within the wet skin cellular environment within 3 min. Finally, we applied ovalbumin protein coated MP patches to immunise mice, achieving comparable antibody levels (p = 0. 08) with needle and syringe intramuscular injection. In summary, this paper presents a simple, practical and versatile method to achieve uniform coating on very small and densely packed MPs for a needle-free and targeted vaccine delivery technology.

Kidneys of intact female (CON) and OVX rats fed ad libitum for 6 and 9 wk or pair-fed for 9 wk were processed for transmission electron microscopy. Immunogold localization of rat TSC (rTSC 1) demonstrated intense label in the apical plasma membrane of CON distal convoluted tubule (DCT). In OVX DCT, rTSC 1 label and apical plasma membrane <b>microprojections</b> were decreased. Western blots of renal membrane protein from pair-fed CON and OVX revealed bands at 129 - 135 kD, but the OVX signal was reduced. Morphometric analyses demonstrated that injecting 10 microg/ kg body weight 17 beta-estradiol subcutaneously 4 x/wk in OVX rats restored DCT apical <b>microprojections</b> and label density for rTSC 1. Thus, in OVX rats (a) rTSC 1 immunoreactive renal membrane protein is reduced; (b) apical plasma membrane complexity and immunogold label for rTSC 1 in DCT is decreased; and (c) estradiol replacement restores DCT ultrastructure and rTSC 1 label to normal.

40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} the endothelial transient receptor vanilloid 4 (TRPV 4) channel’s vasodilatory signaling using mathematical modeling. The model analyzes experimental data by Sonkusare and coworkers on TRPV 4 -induced endothelial Ca 2 + events (sparklets). A previously developed continuum model of an endothelial and a smooth muscle cell coupled through <b>microprojections</b> {{was extended to}} account for the activity of a TRPV 4 channel cluster. Different stochastic descriptions for the TRPV 4 channel flux were examined using finite-state Markov chains. The model also took into consideration recent evidence for the colocalization of intermediate-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (IKCa) and TRPV 4 channels near the <b>microprojections.</b> A single TRPV 4 channel opening resulted in a stochastic localized Ca 2 + increase in a small region (i. e., few μm 2 area) close to the channel. We predict micromolar Ca 2 + increases lasting for the open duration of the channel sufficient for the activation of low-affinity endothelial KCa channels. Simulations of a cluster of four TRPV 4 channels incorporating burst and cooperative gating kinetics provided quantal Ca 2 + increases (i. e., steps of fixed amplitude), similar to the experimentally observed Ca 2 + sparklets. These localized Ca 2 + events result in endothelium-derived hyperpolarization (and SMC relaxation), with magnitude that depends on event frequency. The gating characteristics (bursting, cooperativity) of the TRPV 4 cluster enhance Ca 2 + spread and the distance of KCa channel activation. This may amplify the EDH response by the additional recruitment of distant KCa channels...|$|R

Initial characterization by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy suggested that increasing acid concentration led to increased depth of material modification {{and that this was}} associated with decreased surface hardness and slight changes in surface roughness. Chemical analysis with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared (ATR-FT-IR) spectroscopy showed nitrogen species present at the surface for all acid concentrations used, but subsurface nitrogen species were only observed at acid concentrations > 35 %.

Vaccine delivery to cutaneous environments rich in specialised antigen-presenting cells using <b>microprojection</b> patches has practical and immunological advantages over conventional needle delivery. Additionally, stable coating of vaccine onto microprojections removes logistical obstacles presented by the strict requirement for cold-chain storage and distribution of liquid vaccine, or lyophilised vaccine plus diluent. These attributes make these technologies particularly suitable for delivery of vaccines against diseases such as malaria, which exerts its worst effects in countries with poorly-resourced healthcare systems. Live viral vectors including adenoviruses and poxviruses encoding exogenous antigens have shown significant clinical promise as vaccines, due {{to their ability to}} generate high numbers of antigen-specific T cells. Here, the simian adenovirus serotype 63 and the poxvirus modified vaccinia Ankara - two vectors under evaluation for the delivery of malaria antigens to humans - were formulated for coating onto Nanopatch microprojections and applied to murine skin. Co-formulation with the stabilising disaccharides trehalose and sucrose protected virions during the dry-coating process. Transgene-specific CD 8 (+) T cell responses following Nanopatch delivery of both vectors were similar to intradermal injection controls after a single immunisation (despite a much lower delivered dose), though MVA boosting of pre-primed responses with Nanopatch was found to be less effective than the ID route.

Using a "grafting to" approach, pSBMA and linear PEG coatings yielded comparative antifouling behavior in single protein solutions, diluted plasma, or when applied to mouse flank skin penetrating into the vascularized dermal tissue. Interestingly, the density of immobilized immunoglobulin G (IgG) or bovine serum albumin protein on pSBMA surfaces {{was significantly higher than}} that on the PEG surfaces, while the nonspecific adsorption was comparable for each protein. When incubated in buffer or plasma solutions containing dengue non-structural protein 1 (NS 1), anti-NS 1 -IgG-coated pSBMA surfaces captured significantly more NS 1 in comparison to PEG-coated devices. Similarly, when wearable <b>microprojection</b> arrays were applied to the skin of dengue-infected mice using the same coatings, the pSBMA-coated devices showed significantly higher capture efficiency (> 2 -fold increase in signal) than the PEG-coated substrates, which showed comparative signal when applied to naive mice. In conclusion, zwitterionic pSBMA polymers (of equivalent hydrodynamic radii to PEG) allowed detection of dengue NS 1 disease biomarker in a preclinical model of dengue infection, showing significantly higher signal-to-noise ratio in comparison to the PEG controls.

As revealed by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, the N+ 2 ‐bombarded surface was nitrided for every material, and the nitride zone was confined to the surface or near‐surface for Al and Mo and extended far below the surface for Ti and Ta. It is thus considered that three‐dimensional nitridation lay under the enhanced surface texturing observed for N+ 2 ‐sputtered Ti and Ta...|$|R
40|$|The {{niche in}} which stem cells reside and {{differentiate}} {{is a complex}} physicochemical microenvironment that regulates cell function. The role played by three-dimensional physical contours was studied on cell progeny derived from mouse embryonic stem cells using microtopographies created on PDMS (poly-dimethylsiloxane) membranes. While markers of differentiation were not affected, the proliferation of heterogeneous mouse embryonic stem cell-derived progeny was attenuated by 15 μm-, but not 5 μm-high <b>microprojections.</b> This reduction was reversed by Rho kinase and myosin light chain kinase inhibition, which diminishes the tension generating ability of stress fibers. Purified cardiomyocytes derived from embryonic stem cells also showed significant blunting of proliferation and increased beating rates compared with cells grown on flat substrates. Thus, proliferation of stem cell-derived progeny appears to be regulated by microtopography through tension-generation of contractility in the third-dimension. These results {{emphasize the importance of}} topographic cues in the modulation of stem cell progeny behavior. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Mycoplasmas adhere {{closely to}} the central region of the surface of mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro. They do not appear {{connected}} to each other or the macrophage membrane, and they induce {{no change in the}} surface of the cell. After addition of antimycoplasma antibody, mycoplasmas show interconnections and the cell shows an increase occurrence of ruffled membrane and folding over the mycoplasmas. Large and small lacunae appear in the membrane at sites other than those taking in organisms, and the cell develops a diffusely granular appearance. These changes are associated with an increase in pinocytosis of horseradish peroxidase that is 85 % above controls. Five minutes after addition of antibody, the macrophage appears contracted and engorged and has persistent membrane changes consisting of pits, openings, and membrane folds. Trypsin causes slow ingestion of surface mycoplasmas without the obvious membrane folding over organisms but with evidence of a predominantly invaginating process of phagocytosis. The macrophage surface has numerous <b>microprojections,</b> but is does not have the granular appearance seen after addition of antibody. Trypsin and Mycoplasma pulmonis antigen do not enhance macrophage pinocytic rates. (Am J Pathol 87 : 347 - 358, 1977) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} fast {{evaporation}} aided coating method to coat vaccines onto densely packed and very small <b>microprojection</b> containing patches {{which are used}} to efficiently deliver vaccines to the antigen presenting cells in the dermis/epidermis of the skin. Increased evaporation speed of coating solution aids localization of the vaccines on the distal tips of microprojections that penetrate into the skin; {{rather than to the}} backing and {{to the base of the}} microprojections. Therefore, the delivered efficiency of coated vaccine is increased. This method further improves the dose reduction effects we already observed with this novel patch design. This method of coating therefore will help to make more vaccine doses available in a case of a pandemic, help reduce the cost of the vaccines and provides a platform for future vaccines...|$|E
40|$|Targeting of {{vaccines}} to abundant immune cell populations {{within our}} outer thin skin layers using miniaturized devices-much thinner than a needle and syringe, could improve {{the efficacy of}} vaccines (and other immunotherapies). To meet this goal, a densely packed dissolving <b>microprojection</b> array (dissolving Nanopatch) is designed, achieving functional miniaturization by 1) formulating small microneedles (two orders of magnitude smaller than a standard needle and syringe) and 2) multiple layering of the payload within microprojections with tight tolerances (of {{the order of a}} micrometer). The formulation method is suitable to many vaccines because it is without harsh or complex chemical processes, and it is performed at low temperatures and at a neutral pH. When the formulated dNPs are applied to skin, consistent and robust penetration is achieved, rapidly targeting the skin strata of interest...|$|E
40|$|Herein we {{demonstrate}} {{the use of}} a wearable device that can selectively capture two distinct circulating protein biomarkers (recombinant P. falciparum rPfHRP 2 and total IgG) from the intradermal fluid of live mice in situ, for subsequent detection in vitro. The device comprises a <b>microprojection</b> array that, when applied to the skin, penetrates the outer skin layers to interface directly with intradermal fluid. Because of the complexity of the biological fluid being sampled, we investigated the effects of solution conditions on the attachment of capture antibodies, to optimize the assay detection limit both in vitro and on live mice. For detection of the target antigen diluted in 20 % serum, immobilization conditions favoring high antibody surface density (low pH, low ionic strength) resulted in 100 -fold greater sensitivity in comparison to standard conditions, yielding a detection limit equivalent to the plate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We also show that blocking the device surface to reduce nonspecific adsorption of target analyte and host proteins does not significantly change sensitivity. After injecting mice with rPfHRP 2 via the tail vein, we compared analyte levels in both plasma and skin biopsies (cross-sectional area same as the <b>microprojection</b> array), observing that skin samples contained the equivalent of ∼ 8 μL of analyte-containing plasma. We then applied the arrays to mice, showing that surfaces coated with a high density of antibodies captured a significant amount of the rPfHRP 2 target while the standard surface showed no capture in comparison to the negative control. Next, we applied a triplex device to both control and rPfHRP 2 -treated mice, simultaneously capturing rPfHRP 2 and total IgG (as a positive control for skin penetration) in comparison to a negative control device. We conclude that such devices can be used to capture clinically relevant, circulating protein biomarkers of infectious disease via the skin, with potential applications as a minimally invasive and lab-free biomarker detection platform...|$|E
40|$|The reticulo-epithelial (RE) {{cells of}} the thymus are presumably playing {{a crucial role in}} the {{differentiation}} of the T lineage lymphoid cells, but how this happens is still a matter for speculation. This paper describes a method for rapid preparation of thymic RE cells with as little damage as possible, their culture, and the analysis of their membrane antigens and of other cytological properties. The cultured cells are pleiomorphic, but at least two types can be distinguished, one being round and very villous, the other one being flat and very cystic. Thymus RE cells have species specific surface antigens and large amounts of H- 2 antigen. The possible presence of theta antigen is unclear. Most cells have no detectable Tla antigen. In vitro, they show some uptake of normal mouse serum immunoglobulins. RE cells show a surface migration of ligand-bound membrane antigen; such a capping is much slower than for lymphocytes, and is inhibited by 10 mM NaN 3; The drug also causes the apparition of long <b>microprojections</b> (or retraction fibres) on the villous RE cell type, as is also caused by a slight fixation with formalin. Type C virus particles are found in RE cells from AKR mice as young as 1 day...|$|R
40|$|To {{secure a}} polio-free world, the live {{attenuated}} oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) will eventually {{need to be}} replaced with inactivated poliovirus vaccines (IPV). However, current IPV delivery is less suitable for campaign use than OPV, and more expensive. We are progressing a microarray patch delivery platform, the Nanopatch, as an easy-to-use device to administer vaccines, including IPV. The Nanopatch contains an ultra-high density array (10, 000 /cm(2)) of short (similar to 230 mu m) <b>microprojections</b> that delivers dry coated vaccine into the skin. Here, we compare the relative immunogenicity of Nanopatch immunisation versus intramuscular injection in rats, using monovalent and trivalent formulations of IPV. Nanopatch delivery elicits faster antibody response kinetics, with high titres of neutralising antibody after just one (IPV 2) or two (IPV 1 and IPV 3) immunisations, while IM injection requires two (IPV 2) or three (IPV 1 and IPV 3) immunisations to induce similar responses. Seroconversion to each poliovirus type was seen in 100 % of rats that received similar to 1 / 40 th of a human dose of IPV delivered by Nanopatch, but not in rats given similar to 1 / 8 th or similar to 1 / 40 th dose by IM injection. Ease of administration coupled with dose reduction observed in this study suggests the Nanopatch could facilitate inexpensive IPV vaccination in campaign settings...|$|R
40|$|The lamina densa {{of normal}} human {{epidermis}} was exposed by treatment with 1 M sodium chloride and was examined by high-power {{scanning electron microscopy}} before and after trypsinization. Localization of type IV collagen in the lamina densa was also studied by transmission and scanning immunoelectron microscopy. Before trypsinization, {{the surface of the}} lamina densa consisted of microridges and microvalleys. The microridges varied in height and were connected with each other. They were arranged in a concentric fashion around the tips of the dermal <b>microprojections.</b> At a higher magnification, the surface of the lamina densa was composed of densely packed cobblestone-like structures approximately 7 - 15 nm in size, between which were interspaces 4 - 11 mn wide, These structures expressed type IV collagen. After trypsinization, the lamina densa was found to be composed of microfilaments approximately 10 mn thick showing beaded appearances. These microfilaments exhibited the same cobblestone-like structures as the lamina densa surface. Observation of the torn lamina densa demonstrated anchoring fibrils and oxytalan fibers that were attached to the lamina densa itself. Another kind of filament about 7 nm thick linked the anchoring fibrils and the oxytalan fibers. Beneath the lamina densa was a network of fibers about 40 - 50 nm thick, which was composed of collagen fibers and possibly also elaunin fibers. In Conclusion, this study revealed the detailed surface ultrastructure of the epidermal lamina densa and its underlying filamentous elements...|$|R
