40|$|<b>Marginal</b> {{costs in}} <b>traffic</b> {{networks}} are the extra costs incurred {{to the system}} {{as the result of}} extra <b>traffic.</b> <b>Marginal</b> costs are required frequently e. g. when considering system optimal traffic assignment or tolling problems. When explicitly considering spillback in a traffic flow model, one can use a numerical derivative or resort to heuristics to calculate the marginal costs. Numerical derivatives are computationally demanding, restricting its use to simple networks. Heuristic approaches in most cases approximate the marginal costs by only considering the extra costs on the links which are traveled by the extra traffic, excluding the possibly external costs incurred on other links due to spillback. This paper proposes a novel way to estimate the true <b>marginal</b> costs of <b>traffic</b> in a dynamic discrete LWR model which correctly deals with congestion onset, spillback and dissolution. The proposed methodology tracks virtual changes in density through the network by means of particles which travel along with the characteristics of traffic. By using density based cost functions, the virtual changes in density can be directly related to the marginal costs. The computational efficiency of the methodology {{stems from the fact that}} only local conditions are considered when propagating the virtual change in density. The paper discusses the methodology and necessary model extensions, provides a numerical validation experiment illustrating the exact detail of the solution by comparison to a numerical derivative and discusses some generalizations.

40|$|A welfare {{economic}} {{approach is}} tried to an optimal decision of toll rate {{and expansion of}} urban expressway network in an equilibrium of toll revenues and cost of service supplied. The model, originated with Yamada, is such that the decision comes into optimality when the maximum consumers' surplus is reached in the equilibrium condition. The paper is concerned with some general aspects of the optimal solution and reexamination of the solution obtained {{in the past when}} used a specific demand curve. General aspects obtained are as follows; The extremum condition to consumers' surplus is equivalent to that to diverted traffic (the realized number of expressway users) only when demand curve has such a property that the marginal consumers' surplus to network expansion vanishes. In case that the marginal consumers' surplus does not vanish, the extrema of consumers' surplus is found in the regions of negative <b>marginal</b> diverted <b>traffic</b> if demand curve yields positive marginal surplus, and in the regions of the positive if it gives negative marginal surplus.

This approach utilizes the <b>marginal</b> effect of <b>traffic</b> loading to quantify the load and non-load shares of pavement routine maintenance and rehabilitation expenditures.

We decompose sales volume into conversion rate (defined as the ratio of number of transactions to traffic) and basket value (defined as the ratio of sales volume to number of transactions) and analyze the impact of traffic on sales and its components. We find that store sales volume exhibits diminishing returns to scale with respect to traffic, and labor moderates the impact of traffic on sales. For example, we find that for values of traffic and labor corresponding to the mean, increasing average traffic per hour by one unit increases average sales volume per hour by $ 9. 97.

40|$|The optimal {{charge for}} road use {{is equal to}} {{variable}} costs for road maintenance, together with the costs road users impose on other road users and {{on the rest of}} society. One persistent question raised about such charges is what impact they have on cost recovery. The theoretical literature argues that if there are constant returns to scale in road construction and in road use, the optimal user charge will recover the capital costs of the road network and the total expenditures on road maintenance. Empirical estimates for such a system of road user charges in Tunisia similarly suggest that they would generate twice the revenues currently spent on roads. The authors examine these issues from both theoretical and practical perspectives. They conclude that there are substantial economies of scale in both road construction and road use. Also, road maintenancecosts include a number of fixed costs that do not vary with traffic. Moreover, since roads cannot be smoothly adjusted to <b>traffic,</b> <b>marginal</b> costs for the entire road network are significantly lower than average costs in most developing countries, unless capacity is artificially constrained by environmental or other constraints.

40|$|Traffic {{accidents}} are a painful and costly affliction {{all over the}} world. The discussion and debate over the most effective measures to adopt to enhance road safety is often based on folk theories and is not free of private interests and pressures. Road traffic is a complicated system of interactions providing transportation services. Unfortunately, in conjunction with these services, traffic accidents, an awful public bad, are produced. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to study the production relationship, for intercity transportation, between the physical factors, i. e., highways and vehicles, and traffic accidents. The upshot is prediction ability of accidents in any given road segment, existing or planned. The regretful aspect of roads runs counter to conventional wisdom which, failing to appreciate the quantitative relationship between roads and accidents, often advocates building more and wider roads as the remedy. The empirically substantiated public bad property of roads, by way of production functions for traffic accidents, is useful for public policy, concerning the investment in highways versus other forms of transportation, such as rail. They also promote better understanding of traffic accidents and their data and the methodology allows testing hypotheses relating to safety policy. This study sheds light on the enigma of the long-term decline in the probability of death on the road, as observed in many countries, by attributing it to the rising traffic density. The estimation also sheds light on the accident-externality imposed by road users on others. The results suggest that for inter-city roads the risk of fatal and severe accidents is over-internalized by road users as the <b>marginal</b> effect of <b>traffic</b> flow is smaller than the average. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} issue of the {{allocation}} of railway track maintenance (wear-and-tear) costs to traffic output classes and consider a very general function relating maintenance cost C to a set of technical production characteristics K used to produce traffic output vector T. We neglect other rail cost categories, such as traffic control and track renewal. The data base pertains to over 1500 sections of the French rail infrastructure in 1999, representing about 90 % of the total network of 30000 km of lines in regular service. In addition to the maintenance cost C, it provides by track section 15 technical characteristics (both state S and quality Q) and 4 train traffic outputs T. Input prices, assumed to be uniform in space, disappear from the analysis, as in other national cross-sectional cases. With database subsets of approximately 1000 observations, several functional forms are tested: Linear, Log-Log, trans-Log and generalized Box-Cox. All are embedded in an unrestricted extension (U-GBC) of Khaled's seminal restricted generalized Box-Cox (R-GBC) functional specification. The U-GBC architecture, compared with its 4 principal nested variants, turns out to be by far the most appropriate, in particular when some observed zero traffic sample values are included - an issue rather neglected previously in the literature. It appears that several technical characteristics, such as maximum allowed speed and number of switches, are highly significant maintenance cost factors, which gives a hint that derived marginal costs are short term; also, the relation between maintenance costs and traffic is non linear and differs significantly by train category.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis {{concerns}} pricing the use of transport infrastructure. We are empirically investigating the relationship between railway traffic volumes and infrastructure management costs. More specifically, {{we are interested in}} estimating the change in infrastructure management costs from <b>marginal</b> variations in <b>traffic</b> volumes, i. e. to estimate the marginal cost of railway infrastructure wear and tear. Both Europe and Sweden have moved towards a marginal cost based transport pricing policy, thus driving the need for more empirical work on rail infrastructure costs to underpin the level of a wear and tear charge. The thesis consists of five papers. In paper I, the data situation for planning railway maintenance and renewal is surveyed internationally. The survey indicates that most infrastructure managers are still in the data gathering phase, rather than ready to use modern computerised planning tools to make sound decisions in the field of maintenance and renewal. In paper II, we investigate the data situation for infrastructure cost analysis in Sweden. A panel data set that consists of cost, traffic and infrastructure information is created. The data covers 1999 - 2002 and contains almost 190 annual observations. Three main cost categories are identified; infrastructure operation, maintenance and renewal. This data is used for estimations of cost functions in paper II, III and V. Econometric techniques are applied for this purpose, with several different model specifications. In paper II, the method of pooled ordinary least squares (POLS) is applied. In paper III, we turn to unobserved effects models to exploit data heterogeneity. Finally in paper V, a dynamic generalised method of moments estimator is used to explore a potential dynamic cost dependency. The main findings are that the POLS approach, which has been used in similar studies in Europe recently, is rejected in favour of fixed effects estimation for this data. Furthermore, we also reject the idea of regression analysis to capture marginal rail renewal costs. In paper IV, we suggest an analytical expression combined with survival analysis of rail ages to estimate marginal renewal costs. We derive elasticities with respect to output as well as marginal costs for the different cost categories, and find that the current charge for wear and tear in Sweden is well below these new estimates. This opens up for increased, marginal cost based rail infrastructure wear and tear charges, which would reduce the financial burden on Swedish tax-payers. QC 2010062...|$|R
