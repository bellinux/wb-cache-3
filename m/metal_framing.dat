The seating tiers are of formed concrete and seats are of formed plastic supported on <b>metal</b> <b>framing.</b> Steel framing supports a cantilevered awning roof. The roof and side and rear walls are clad with wide-profile metal sheeting. There is a metal sheeted balustrade along the sides and front. The sub-floor contains a bar and other members facilities.|$|E
500|$|The Rookery {{was built}} in 1888 by the {{architectural}} partnership of Daniel H. Burnham and John Wellborn Root, known as Burnham and Root. In the architectural boom that followed the Great Chicago Fire, architects in what would {{become known as the}} Chicago School of commercial architecture competed with each other to create the world's first true skyscrapers. [...] By mixing modern building techniques, such as <b>metal</b> <b>framing,</b> fireproofing, elevators and plate glass, together with traditional ones, such as brick facades and elaborate ornamentation, Burnham and Root sought to create a bold architectural statement. [...] At the same time, they intended their buildings to be commercially successful. [...] This building {{is one of the few}} results of their partnership that is still standing.|$|E
500|$|The wings {{were built}} with two spars. The upper wing {{was made in}} three parts, with the middle section being of {{duralumin}} and the outer ones being made of wood. The wooden lower wings were built in single sections, using a Göttingen-436 profile. The duralumin N-type struts that separated the wings, and attached the upper wing to the fuselage, had a teardrop profile and were reinforced with steel bracing wires. Laced lacquered fabric covered the empennage and wings, except for {{the roots of the}} lower wings which were covered in plywood and the leading edges of the wings were skinned in duralumin for the first [...] Ailerons were fitted only to the upper wing. All movable control surfaces and the tail section were built with doped fabric over <b>metal</b> <b>framing.</b> Bracing wires above and below the tail were fitted on the prototypes, but production aircraft replaced the lower wires with a strut on each side. The horizontal tail was offset [...] to port to compensate for the engine's torque, but it could be adjusted on the ground.|$|E
30|$|The {{mounting}} cushion {{adopts a}} combination design method of vulcanized rubber, anti-aging agent, and <b>metal</b> <b>frame.</b> The appropriate choice of vulcanized rubber, proportion of anti-aging agent, and {{shape and size}} of the <b>metal</b> <b>frame</b> can result in the hardness and thickness parameters of the rubber mount presented in Table  6. The combination of the rubber, agent, and <b>metal</b> <b>frame</b> enables the achievement of a strong bond and facilitates deformation in the directions of stretching, compression, and shearing.|$|R
30|$|In the {{previous}} study [6], the ordinary hot press could not manufacture 10 -mm-thick boards with a <b>metal</b> <b>frame</b> placed on particle mats because the boards blew out. Conversely, the air-injection press successfully manufactured 10 -mm-thick boards {{even when the}} <b>metal</b> <b>frame</b> was used. In this study, 20 -mm boards were manufactured by following the methods in {{the previous}} study [6]. The 20 -mm boards blew out when they were hot pressed using <b>metal</b> <b>frames</b> and no air was injected. In contrast, air injection facilitated the manufacture of 20 -mm boards, even when the <b>metal</b> <b>frames</b> were used, showing that air injection was also effective in preventing blowout of 20 -mm boards.|$|R

50|$|Boulton & Paul {{developed}} steel-framed aircraft {{under their}} designer John Dudley North. The {{first was the}} Boulton & Paul P.10 which used steel tubes rolled from sheet metal. It was exhibited - but not flown - at the Paris Air Show in 1919. Official interest in <b>metal</b> <b>frame</b> designs led to an order of a single Boulton & Paul Bolton, a twin-engine bomber design. In the same period Boulton & Paul produced another <b>metal</b> <b>framed</b> design, the Bodmin, with its engines in the fuselage. North believed that a <b>metal</b> <b>frame</b> could be 10% lighter than an equivalent wooden frame.|$|R

As practitioner, he produced major commissions in a highly ornamented neo-classical surface style, collaborating with sculptors and muralists squarely in the Beaux-Arts tradition, but doing so on innovative cast-iron frames. <b>Metal</b> <b>framing</b> allowed higher interior spaces, more generous fenestration, and glass roofs, notably in the sunlit barrel-vault of the Gare d'Orsay.|$|E

50|$|Buildings {{currently}} {{account for}} 1/6th of the world’s freshwater use, 1/4th of all wood harvests, 2/5th of all material flows, and 2/5th of all energy flows.

Some sustainable materials used in Green Building that could reduce that percentage- fly ash, sealtech block, cold-form <b>metal</b> <b>framing,</b> ecosurfaces, reclaimed lumber, composting, waterless urinals, greenscreen PVC-free fabrics, climate upholstery fabrics, evergreen solar panels, dual-flush toilets, and PS400 flat wall form.|$|E
50|$|Starting in the mid-20th century, {{instruments}} were introduced whose construction followed historical principles, with thinner cases, historical dispositions (arrangements of choirs of strings) and no <b>metal</b> <b>framing.</b> Among {{the leaders of}} this shift were Frank Hubbard, William Dowd, and Martin Skowroneck. With time, such instruments came to dominate the scene, and the older heavy-frame instruments are almost never manufactured today. They retain historical value, however, since they were the instruments that early to mid-20th-century composers {{had in mind when}} they wrote their works.|$|E

It lay dormant until the mid-1980s, when {{for a brief time}} the west third of the terminal was equipped for international arrivals and used for some People Express transcontinental flights. Terminal C was finally completed and opened in June 1988.|$|E
