The system consists of four robotic arms, which can be equipped with either minimally invasive instruments or a stereo camera. The <b>master</b> <b>console</b> provides a stereo view {{of the field of}} operation and two input devices can feed back forces to the user. We have utilized this system to assess the possibility of automating difficult handling tasks like surgical knot tying. In order to achieve this, a novel approach for human-machine skill transfer was developed. It constitutes an extension to learning by demonstration, which is a well known paradigm of robotic learning. Index Terms—learning by demonstration, skill transfer, robotic surgery I...|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) has revolutionised surgical care, considerably {{improving the quality}} of many surgical procedures. Technological advances, particularly in robotic surgery systems, have reduced the complexity of such an approach, paving the way for even less invasive surgical trends. However, the fact that haptic feedback has been progressively lost through this transition is an issue that to date has not been solved. Whereas traditional open surgery provides full haptic feedback, the {{introduction of}} MIS has eliminated the possibility of direct palpation and tactile exploration. Nevertheless, these procedures still provide a certain amount of force feedback through the rigid laparoscopic tool. Many of the current telemanipulated robotic surgical systems in return do not provide full haptic feedback, which to a certain extent {{can be explained by the}} requirement of force sensors integrated into the tools of the slave robot and actuators in the surgeon’s <b>master</b> <b>console.</b> In view of the increased complexity and cost, the benefit of haptic feedback is open to dispute. Nevertheless, studies have shown the importance of haptic feedback, especially when visual feedback is unreliable or absent. In order to explore the importance of haptic feedback for the surgeon’s <b>master</b> <b>console</b> of a novel teleoperated robotic surgical system, we have identified a typical surgical task where performance could potentially be improved by haptic feedback, and investigate performance with and without this feedback. Two rounds of experiments are performed with 10 subjects, six of them with a medical background. Results show that feedback conditions, including force feedback, significantly improve task performance independently of the operator’s suturing experience. There is, however, no further significant improvement when torque feedback is added. Consequently, it is deduced that force feedback in translations improves subject’s dexterity, while torque feedback might not further benefit such a task...|$|E

40|$|Haptics {{feedback}} {{is a potential}} enhancement for surgeon's performance in robotic surgery. In this paper, we attempted to tackle the challenges in this application from three aspects: haptic information acquisition, design of a haptics enabled <b>master</b> <b>console</b> and system control. Taking the MASTER (Master And Slave Transluminal Endoscopic Robot) system as an example, we shared our solutions and concerns in designing a haptic enabled robotic system specifically for NOTES. By analyzing the driving mechanism of the system, a method was proposed to estimate the forces at the distal end (end-effectors) by measuring the forces at the proximal end (actuator housing). To implement this method, a force transmission model was developed for tendon-sheath actuation with unknown arbitrary configurations. With the presence of haptic feedback, {{it appears that the}} position control of the system also could be improved. It is hoped that this robotic system enhanced with haptic feedback could help to pave the way to the introduction of clinical NOTES. © 2011 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

5000|$|There {{were three}} {{mastering}} engineers at Sterling Sound when Jensen {{was hired to}} work in the tape copy room, George Marino, Lee Hulko and Greg Calbi. One of Jensen's earliest mastering jobs was the first single by the Talking Heads, [...] "Love → Building on Fire" [...] and later that year, Jensen mastered The Eagles' Hotel California. The following year, he mastered Billy Joel's The Stranger, which began a working relationship with Phil Ramone. Jensen was promoted to Chief Mastering Engineer at Sterling in 1984, and since then has overseen several proprietary developments in mastering technology. This included working closely with Graham Boswell of Neve Electronics in the mid-1980s in developing the first all-digital <b>mastering</b> <b>console,</b> the DTC-1, and as one of the consultants to Apple for Mastering for iTunes. Jensen also designed some of the studio monitors at Sterling, including the ones used by Tom Coyne.

40|$|Abstract — The {{introduction}} of robotic master-slave systems for {{minimally invasive surgery}} has created new opportunities in assisting surgeons with partial or fully autonomous func-tions. While autonomy is an ongoing field of research, {{the question of how}} the growing number of offered features can be triggered in a time-saving manner at the <b>master</b> <b>console</b> is not well investigated. We have implemented a gesture-based user interface, whereas the haptic input devices that are commonly used to control the surgical instruments, are used to trigger actions. Intuitive and customizable gestures are learned by the system once, linked to a certain command, and recalled during operation as the gesture is presented by the surgeon. Experimental user studies with 24 participants have been conducted to evaluate the efficiency, accuracy and user experience of this input method compared to a traditional menu. The results have shown the potential of gesture-based input, especially in terms of time savings and enhanced user experience.

40|$|The <b>Master</b> <b>Console</b> {{oversees the}} {{function}} of Computer Systems in Firing room 1 (FR 1). <b>Master</b> <b>Console</b> Operators, MCOs' for short, are our customer. I was integrated into the System Monitoring and Control (SMC) software team that is {{under the guidance of}} David Slaiman, who is the product group lead. I have been brought up to speed with System Monitoring and Control. The initial time spent reading SMC software design description and understanding how it works. The current Firing Room 1 Console Display is a floor layout giving the MCO two essential pieces of information which are Health and Status. When an issue arises, the MCO has to look on the display to find which console is affected and then the MCO must use the Reference designator from the display to manually search for the Portal Workstation (PWS) installed in the console using the hardware map; which is a long process to lookup a PWS if an issue is present. My project is to make the FR 1 Console Display easier for the MCO's to pinpoint PWS's without having to lookup additional resources in the process. My project also includes updating Firing Room 1 Console Display to include the F 1 R Non-Redundant Set. The display does not have good use of space and functionality. PWS numbers were not present in the previous design and are the critical component in efficient understanding and administration of the consoles. Part of the process includes getting feedback from the customer, instead of just emailing them with a question, we made a proposal with changes so they could respond and give us their input; which proved to be an effective method for engaging them. In order to do this I had to use the Display Editor (DE) tool developed by NASA, Paint. Net and Visio. The process I have been using has been Visio to alter the floor layout of Firing Room and take advantage of the white areas, and then I take the altered floor plan into Paint. Net. Once in Paint. Net I put the new floor plan as a background to the standard console display. Paint. Net also serves as a tool to create the new service state bars for the new background; finally I used the DE to assemble everything and setup the right CUI's for each PWS...|$|E

Marino's studio is one of the three surround sound studios at Sterling and it was designed by Fran Manzella, FM Design. Marino's room became one of the few mastering suites in the industry, if not the only one, that was capable of doing both surround sound and vinyl mastering. Marino, along with Chris Muth and Sterling techs Barry Wolifson and Phil Sztenderowicz, turned Marino's <b>mastering</b> <b>console</b> into an 8 channel A/B preview console. This design made possible presetting console parameters from song to song, which is needed for the continuous process of cutting a side of a vinyl album. This type of design was common in mastering houses during vinyl's heyday, but what made this one different was the ability to also process 6 discrete channels for surround sound.|$|R
