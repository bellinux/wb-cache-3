40|$|Purpose: We {{examine the}} {{association}} between the presence of <b>monitoring</b> <b>board</b> committees (i. e., audit, nomination, and remuneration) and market valuation in South Africa using a sample of 169 listed corporations from 2002 to 2007. Design/methodology/approach: We distinctively employ fixed-effects and two-stage least squares regressions to innovatively investigate {{the association between}} the presence of <b>monitoring</b> <b>board</b> committees and market valuation. Findings: We find a significant positive connection between the presence of <b>monitoring</b> <b>board</b> committees and market valuation, but only in corporations that have independent <b>monitoring</b> <b>board</b> committees and/or all three <b>monitoring</b> <b>board</b> committees that we have investigated simultaneously. This implies that the market values corporations with independent and/or the three <b>monitoring</b> <b>board</b> committees more highly. Our results provide empirical support for agency theory, which indicates {{that the presence of}} independent board committees increases the capacity of corporate boards to effectively advise, monitor and discipline top management, and thereby improving market valuation. Originality/value: There is an acute dearth of studies examining the connection between the presence of <b>monitoring</b> <b>board</b> committees and market valuation generally, but particularly in developing countries. Therefore, our evidence contributes to the literature by demonstrating how the presence of <b>monitoring</b> <b>board</b> committees affects market valuation in a major developing African country. Further, we distinctively employ a number of econometric models that adequately control for different types of endogeneity problems and market valuation proxies.

Although some program variances may be appropriate/necessary, a proposal for some harmonization of key issues across Divisions was put forth at the 2005 NIAID Winter Program Retreat. A Working Group representing all Divisions collected and analyzed data on Data and Safety <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Board</b> practices. This policy specifies those operational requirements for DSMBs that are mandatory across the Institute. 3. 0 DEFINITIONS 3. 1 Data and Safety <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Board</b> (DSMB) “Data and safety <b>monitoring</b> <b>board</b> " refers to a committee of experts, independent of the trial investigators, pharmaceutical sponsor (if any), and funding agency, that periodically reviews the conduct and results of the trial and recommends continuation without change, continuation with change, or termination of the trial.

50|$|The board {{received}} seventeen proposals {{of different}} form, practicality, {{and degree of}} detail, ranging from William Norris’s ninety-ton steam gunboat to Edward S. Renwick’s 6,520-ton giant. The board recommended that Welles build three of the proposed ships. One of the designs it accepted, which became the USS Galena, was proposed by Cornelius S. Bushnell. The Galena had a traditional hull and broadside battery. Even with a conventional sailing rig, the proposal was bizarre, and the board required Bushnell to guarantee the ship’s ability to float and its stability. A second design, even more abnormal, was John Ericsson's single-turreted, low-freeboard vessel. Ericsson’s design had the shallowest draft and shortest estimated construction time, but against it were its extremely low freeboard, turret-mounted guns, and total reliance on steam power. The board took a flyer on Ericsson, and quick construction {{was the most important}} thing in Welles’s decision to build the <b>Monitor.</b> <b>Board</b> members saw what the Union navy needed instantly—”vessels invulnerable to shot, of light draught of water”—but other factors clearly affected their deliberations. The board, therefore, took out insurance by choosing as its third vessel a fully rigged, high-freeboard ship with solid wrought-iron armor and a broadside battery. The prevailing theme of the Union ironclad program was urgency, but urgency compounded by technological confusion. Increasing production of a proven design would have been difficult enough, without the handicap of having to design, test, and build it at the same time.|$|E
