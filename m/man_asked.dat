5|$|Because of {{the loss}} of his father, Skelton went to work as early as the age of seven, selling {{newspapers}} and doing other odd jobs to help his family, who had lost the family store and their home. He quickly learned the newsboy's patter and would keep it up until a prospective buyer bought a copy of the paper just to quiet him. According to later accounts, Skelton's early interest in becoming an entertainer stemmed from an incident that took place in Vincennes around 1923, when a stranger, supposedly the comedian Ed Wynn, approached Skelton, who was the newsboy selling papers outside a Vincennes theater. When the <b>man</b> <b>asked</b> Skelton what events were going on in town, Skelton suggested he see the new show in town. The man purchased every paper Skelton had, providing enough money for the boy to purchase a ticket for himself. The stranger {{turned out to be one}} of the show's stars, who later took the boy backstage to introduce him to the other performers. The experience prompted Skelton, who had already shown comedic tendencies, to pursue a career as a performer.|$|E
5|$|Several {{witnesses}} reported men collecting for charity. On 20 April, {{four hundred}} yards from apartment 5A, a bedraggled-looking <b>man</b> <b>asked</b> a tourist in her holiday apartment for money for an orphanage in nearby Espiche. She described him as pushy and intimidating, and said he made her feel uncomfortable. Apparently there were no orphanages or similar institutions in or near Espiche at that time. On the afternoon of 25 or 26 April, the tourist who rented apartment 5A before the McCanns encountered a man on his balcony who had entered via the steps from the street. Polite and clean-shaven, the visitor asked for money for an orphanage. On {{the day of the}} disappearance, 3 May, there were four charity collections by two men in the streets around 5A. At 4 pm two black-haired men approached a British homeowner looking for funds for a hostel or hospice in or near Espiche, and at 5 pm two men approached another British tourist with a similar story.|$|E

In those minutes the doctors decided not to operate and instead had him sent to St Bartholomew's Hospital. After two years convalescence, he fully recovered.|$|E

They also went to the earthquake, which said that it was {{necessary}} for them to marry, so that the world might be peopled.|$|E
25|$|Just as the Athenians were {{preparing}} to sail home, on August 28, there was a lunar eclipse, and Nicias, described by Thucydides as a particularly superstitious <b>man,</b> <b>asked</b> the priests what he should do. They suggested the Athenians wait for another 27 days, and Nicias agreed. The Syracusans took advantage of this, and 76 of their ships attacked 86 Athenian ships in the harbour. The Athenians were defeated and Eurymedon was killed. Many of the ships were pushed on to the shore, where Gylippus was waiting. He killed some of the crews and captured 18 beached ships, but a force of Athenians and Etruscans forced Gylippus back.|$|E
25|$|In 1929 Childs was {{selected}} by the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) to attend the elite International Lenin School in Moscow, a training school for professional revolutionaries. Early in 1930, Childs was approached by {{an agent of the}} Soviet secret police, the OGPU, who had noted in Childs' file that he had helped to successfully identify a police spy in the Communist organization of Chicago. The <b>man</b> <b>asked</b> Childs to become an informer for the agency to help keep tabs on the ideological foibles of his Lenin School comrades. Childs agreed with the request and thereafter provided periodic reports. During his second year at the Lenin School, Childs made the personal acquaintance of a number of high-level Soviet officials who taught courses at the school, including exiled Finnish revolutionary leader Otto Kuusinen and a young ideology expert named Mikhail Suslov.|$|E

25|$|In 1796, Dussek and {{his wife}} began having serious marital troubles. In an account of {{uncertain}} veracity, {{it was reported that}} Sophia, who {{had fallen in love with}} another <b>man,</b> <b>asked</b> Dussek for money to repair her harp. She then used the money to leave the house, removing her belongings in her harp case, and claiming to have left for dinner with a female friend. A suspicious Dussek went with his father-in-law to the man's house, where Sophia locked herself in. She and Dussek argued, and she cursed him, claiming to be pregnant by the other man. Dussek, relenting, promised her freedom to do what she wanted; this led to a reconciliation of sorts. It seems unlikely that Dussek ever saw Sophia and his daughter Olivia after he left London in 1799; Sophia had to wait until she knew Dussek had died before she could remarry, which she did in 1812.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{reported}} cases may be myths, or wandering stories. The 1326 Hennegau case, for example, deviates from the others in that the Jew was not a thief, but was suspected (even {{though he was a}} convert to Christianity) of having struck an al fresco painting of Virgin Mary, so that blood had begun to seep down the wall from the painting. Even under all degrees of judicial torture, the Jew denied performing this sacrilegious act, and was therefore exonerated. Then a brawny smith demanded from him a trial by combat, because, supposedly, in a dream the Virgin herself had besought the smith to do so. The court accepted the smith's challenge, he easily won the combat against the Jew, who was duly hanged up by the feet between two dogs. To add to the injury, one let him be slowly roasted as well as hanged. This is a very similar story to one told in France, in which a young Jew threw a lance {{at the head of a}} statue of the Virgin, so that blood spurted out of it. There was inadequate evidence for a normal trial, but a frail old <b>man</b> <b>asked</b> for trial by combat, and bested the young Jew. The Jew confessed his crime, and was hanged by his feet between two mastiffs.|$|E

One <b>man</b> <b>asked</b> for the privilege of placing the balls in a certain position for Adams to bowl at; Adams made the shot easily. This started Adams' career as a finger billiard expert. In the next town he traveled to, he hired a table, performed the same stunts with the balls, and added a few new shots. For three months after that Adams practiced various shots each day, and some of the shots he developed during that time became part of his regular exhibition repertoire.|$|E
500|$|Thomas W. Lynch {{first had}} the idea for South of Nowhere {{when one of his}} close {{conservative}} friends told Lynch that his son had just come out to him. The <b>man</b> <b>asked</b> his son, [...] "How do you know you're gay?" [...] and the son responded, [...] "How do you know you're straight?" [...] When Lynch heard this, he says, he [...] "knew there was a series in there about identity." [...] He wondered why such a noteworthy eventan adolescent's coming out to their parentshad never before been explored as an ongoing subject on a television series. He [...] "sat with the idea for a few days" [...] and then wrote an outline of the show's pilot over a few weeks. In an effort to maintain authenticity in depicting teenage experiences, Lynch spoke to high school counselors and asked drama students at a Los Angeles high school for feedback. He pitched the serieswhich he was then calling [...] "Out"to The N executives Amy Friedman and Essie Chambers, who then commissioned him to write the pilot script.|$|E
500|$|Detectives {{from the}} King County Sheriff's Office and the Seattle Police Department grew {{increasingly}} concerned. There {{was no significant}} physical evidence, and the missing women had little in common, apart from being young, attractive, white college students with long hair parted in the middle. On June 1, Brenda Carol Ball, 22, disappeared after leaving the Flame Tavern in Burien, Washington, near Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. She was last seen {{in the parking lot}} talking to a brown-haired man with his arm in a sling. In the early hours of June 11, UW student Georgann [...] Hawkins vanished while walking down a brightly lit alley between her boyfriend's dormitory residence and her sorority house. The next morning, three Seattle homicide detectives and a criminalist combed the entire alleyway on their hands and knees, finding nothing. After Hawkins's disappearance was publicized, witnesses came forward to report seeing a man that night in an alley behind a nearby dormitory, on crutches with a leg cast, struggling to carry a briefcase. One woman recalled that the <b>man</b> <b>asked</b> her to help him carry the case to his car, a light brown Volkswagen Beetle.|$|E

500|$|Schwimmer {{starred in}} his first leading film role in the 1996 romantic comedy film, The Pallbearer with Gwyneth Paltrow. In the film, Schwimmer plays a <b>man</b> <b>asked</b> to deliver the eulogy for a high school friend he cannot remember, and begins an affair with the friend's mother. Critics {{dismissed}} The Pallbearer as a poor imitation of the 1967 film The Graduate. Varietys film reviewer complimented the actor, writing that he had enjoyed his performance, stating that he displayed [...] "a winning, if rather deadpan, personality along with good comic timing". It also concluded that Schwimmer had a [...] "promising bigscreen future". Janet Maslin of The New York Times cited that his first film [...] "relegates him to a drab role". When asked why he decided to accept the role, Schwimmer admitted the decision was to [...] "make {{an effort to find}} roles that are as far away from the character of Ross as possible". He was offered a role to star alongside Tommy Lee Jones in the 1997 science-fiction comedy Men in Black, but turned it down in favor of starring in The Pallbearer, explaining, [...] "This is an opportunity to grow rather than go for the quick cash".|$|E
500|$|After the {{election}} was called in April 1957 for 10 June, Howe raised sufficient money to enable the Liberals to heavily outspend their opponents. [...] As there were few Liberal ministers from western Canada, Howe was called upon to make appearances throughout the region. He found that the Manitoba Farmers Union was organizing opposition to the Liberals; at some meetings Howe had difficulty getting heard at all. At other meetings, Howe engaged in well publicised conflicts with audience members. On 19 May in Morris, Manitoba, Howe told one man demanding to speak that when his own party held a meeting, he could ask all the questions he wanted. The man, Bruce Mackenzie, {{proved to be the}} head of a local Liberal association. As Howe left, another <b>man</b> <b>asked</b> why he had not answered his question, posed earlier. Howe replied, [...] "Look here, my good man, when {{the election}} comes, why don't you go away and vote for the party you support? [...] In fact, why don't you just go away?" [...] At another meeting a few days later, Howe was asked why he did not care about the farmers's economic plight. [...] "Looks like you've been eating pretty well under a Liberal government", Howe replied, poking the questioner in the midsection.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{initiative}} was usually the husband's, the wife {{had to agree}} to the sale. An 1824 report from Manchester says that [...] "after several biddings she [...] was knocked down for 5s; but not liking the purchaser, she was put up again for 3s and a quart of ale". Frequently the wife was already living with her new partner. In one case in 1804 a London shopkeeper found his wife in bed with a stranger to him, who, following an altercation, offered to purchase the wife. The shopkeeper agreed, and in this instance the sale may have been an acceptable method of resolving the situation. However, the sale was sometimes spontaneous, and the wife could find herself the subject of bids from total strangers. In March 1766, a carpenter from Southwark sold his wife [...] "in a fit of conjugal indifference at the alehouse". Once sober, the <b>man</b> <b>asked</b> his wife to return, and after she refused he hanged himself. A domestic fight might sometimes precede the sale of a wife, but in most recorded cases the intent was to end a marriage in a way that gave it the legitimacy of a divorce. In some cases the wife arranged for her own sale, and even provided the money for her agent to buy her out of her marriage, such as an 1822 case in Plymouth.|$|E
