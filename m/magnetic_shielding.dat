25|$|In 1965, the Mariner 4 probe {{discovered}} that Mars had no global magnetic field {{that would protect}} the planet from potentially life-threatening cosmic radiation and solar radiation; observations made in the late 1990s by the Mars Global Surveyor orbiter confirmed this discovery.

As a result, the planet has been vulnerable to radiation from space for about 4 billion years.|$|E

5000|$|Equipment {{sometimes}} requires {{isolation from}} external magnetic fields. For static or slowly varying magnetic fields (below about 100 kHz) the Faraday shielding described above is ineffective. In these cases shields made of high magnetic permeability metal alloys can be used, such as sheets of Permalloy and Mu-Metal (trademark of <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Shield</b> Corporation, Illinois), or with nanocrystalline grain structure ferromagnetic metal coatings. [...] These materials don't block the magnetic field, as with electric shielding, but rather draw the field into themselves, providing {{a path for}} the magnetic field lines around the shielded volume. The best shape for <b>magnetic</b> <b>shields</b> is thus a closed container surrounding the shielded volume. The effectiveness {{of this type of}} shielding depends on the material's permeability, which generally drops off at both very low magnetic field strengths and at high field strengths where the material becomes saturated. So to achieve low residual fields, <b>magnetic</b> <b>shields</b> often consist of several enclosures one inside the other, each of which successively reduces the field inside it.|$|R

The optimization of single-pole-type head having a <b>magnetic</b> <b>shield</b> is performed by using the topology optimization technique so that the leakage flux in the adjacent bit can be reduced. A useful shape of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>shield</b> obtained by the proposed technique is illustrated. </p...|$|R

40|$|A trade {{study for}} an active {{shielding}} concept based on magnetic fields in a solenoid configuration versus mass based shielding was developed. Monte Carlo simulations {{were used to}} estimate the radiation exposure for two values of the magnetic field strength and {{the mass of the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>shield</b> configuration. For each field strength, results were reported for the <b>magnetic</b> region <b>shielding</b> (end caps ignored) and total region shielding (end caps included but no magnetic field protection) configurations.

The radiation dose estimate over the total shield region configuration cannot be used at this time without {{a better understanding of the}} material and mass present in the end cap regions through a detailed vehicle design. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>shield</b> region configuration, assuming the end cap regions contribute zero exposure, can be launched on a single Space Launch System rocket and up to a two year mission can be supported. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>shield</b> region configuration results in two versus nine launches for a comparable mass based shielding configuration.
