40|$|Abstract. The {{normal and}} inverse solute <b>macro-segregation</b> {{are known to}} occur in Al and other {{nonferrous}} alloy castings and have been well studied and documented. However, these phenomena have not been investigated in the high-pressure die-cast Mg-alloys. Consequently, the effects of <b>macro-segregation</b> on the mechanical properties of cast Mg-alloys have not been characterized. The objective of this contribution is to investigate the effects of inverse <b>macro-segregation</b> and porosity on the fatigue behavior of high-pressure die-cast AM 60 alloy. It is observed that the inverse <b>macro-segregation</b> of eutectic phase at the cast surfaces adversely affects the fatigue behavior: the fatigue resistance decreases substantially due {{to the presence of}} the surface segregation...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} has been performed {{to study the}} effects of convection streams and the movement of dendritic solid on the macrosegregation in equiaxed structure of aluminium cast ingots. The investigation combined laboratory work, metallographic examination and mathematical modelling. The laboratory work involved different superheats for Al- 10 %Si alloy cast ingots. The measurements of grain size of equiaxed crystals and <b>macro-segregation</b> distributions have been conducted to verify the solidification model by using the metallographic study combined macro/micro-structural evolution of cast ingot samples. Two-dimensional mathematical model of fluid flow and heat transfer has been developed to characterise the natural convection streams, thermal fields and <b>macro-segregation</b> distributions taken into account the effect of dendritic solid movements. The model predictions were compared to measurements of cooling curves and <b>macro-segregation</b> distributions where the reasonable agreements were found.

The model consists of fully coupled conservation equations for the transport phenomena (heat transfer, solute redistribution, and melt convection) that lead to <b>macro-segregation</b> in a solidifying ingot with a fixed solid phase. Simulations were performed for solidification of either a Pb- 48 wt. %Sn or a Sn- 5 wt. %Pb alloy in a rectangular cavity. The present predictions were compared with experimental data and numerical reference results reported in the literature. Subsequently, the model was applied to a numerical benchmark problem described in the literature for solidification of a Sn- 10 wt. %Pb alloy. Simulation results for flow velocity, liquid fraction evolution, and <b>macro-segregation</b> maps also were compared with literature predictions, showing similar trends.

40|$|A new {{multi-phase}} Eulerian {{model for}} the columnar and equiaxed dendritic solidification has been developped. The mean conservation equations are derived {{by means of a}} statistical phase averaging technique, and the mathematical formulation of the model can be used for both columnar (c), equiaxed (e) and mixed c/e solidification. The use of such an averaging procedure has several advantages compared with the volume averaging technique which has been widely used during the last decade. However, the most important one is that, owing to the statistical nature of the model, one is able to treat rigorously the coexistence of equiaxed and columnar structures and consequently the CET phenomena. The averaged equations are closed by means of the cell model approximation. This model can be applied to treat one-dimensional simulations of AlCu quasi-steady solidifications in order to obtain the corresponding CET maps. The model is able to reproduce mixed columnar/equiaxed zones within the CET maps and put forth a "double mechanical blockage" of the columnar structures produced by the equiaxed zone ahead of the columnar front. Moreover, the solutal blockage mechanism is intrinsically taken into account by the model. In this respect the new ensemble averaged model unifies rigorously both the mechanical and the solutal blockage mechanism producing the CET. In the 2 D-casen the numerical model can be used to simulate either columnar or purely equiaxed situations. In the columnar case the model is able to predict succesfully the <b>macro-segregations</b> produced by an electromagnetically-driven convection. Nous avons développé un modèle numérique capable de traiter la solidification de type colonnaire et/ou équiaxe. Le modèle repose sur une nouvelle approche de moyennage de type statistique. Ce type de moyennage permet d'obtenir trois types de régimes : colonnaire, équiaxe et mixte. Dans le cas monodimensionnel, le modèle prédit correctement la transition colonnaire-équiaxe. Dans les cas bi- ou tri-dimensionnel, le modèle est capable de prédire avec succès les <b>macro-ségrégations</b> engendrées par une convection forcée de type électromagnétique par exemple dans le cas d'une solidification colonnaire...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{documented}} that ultrasonic melt treatment (USMT) can refine dendritic and eutectic microstructures during solidification, but much less {{attention has been paid}} to the effect of USMT on <b>macro-segregation</b> and intermetallic transformations. In this research, <b>macro-segregation</b> and primary Fe-containing intermetallic peritectic transformations in an Al- 19 wt pct Si- 4 wt pct Fe alloy were investigated without and with USMT. Macrostructural examination showed that in the absence of USMT the ingot revealed considerable non-uniform distribution of both the primary Fe-containing intermetallic and primary Si particles, whereas the ingot with USMT exhibited near homogeneous distribution of both primary phases, i. e., reduced <b>macro-segregation.</b> The beneficial effect of USMT on relieving <b>macro-segregation</b> was further examined using quantitative microstructural metallography and the results indicated that the area fraction, number density, and size distribution of both primary phases became essentially uniform across the ingot after USMT. USMT further exerted a significant impact on the constitution of the primary Fe-containing intermetallics, where complex particles of delta-Al 3 FeSi 2 /beta-Al 5 FeSi were prominent without USMT, while few delta-Al 3 FeSi 2 particles were observed after USMT and the primary Fe-containing intermetallics existed mostly as the single-phase beta-Al 5 FeSi. The underlying reason was attributed to the reduction in the size of the primary delta-Al 3 FeSi 2 particles which ensures the complete transformation of most primary delta-Al 3 FeSi 2 particles to the peritectic beta-Al 5 FeSi phase.

40|$|Purpose: This article {{describes}} {{performance of the}} experimental 90 -ton forging ingot casting, the way of cutting, the methodology of chemical analysis {{and the results of}} that investigation. Design/methodology/approach: The experimental ingot 8 K 91 SF weighing almost 90 tons was cast due the performance a detailed analysis of the current state of casting and solidification. The ingot was cut and macrostructure and chemical heterogeneity of the ingot was evaluated in detail. The standard method used in metallurgical analytics - analyses using optical emission spectrometers - was not applicable due to the large number of required analyzes. Thus, the mobile optical spectrometer SPECRTOTEST was used. Sulfur prints and fluid penetration tests were performed due to detect macroscopic distribution of sulfur and to locate surface-breaking defects. Findings: Current level of segregations of selected elements in real 90 -ton steel ingot was detected. Also mutual mixing of two heats needed for the production of this ingot was verified. Research limitations/implications: Future research is focused on determination of inclusion content in selected parts of experimental ingot and on the level of micro-segregations. We are limited by the accuracy of chosen analytical method, which is also discussed in the paper. Practical implications: The gained knowledge is used to specification of the setting of boundary conditions of the numerical simulations, which should help to optimize the production technology of casting heavy forging ingots and minimize the level of segregation in ingots. Originality/value: New knowledge concerning mutual mixing of two heats needed for bottom casting of heavy forging ingot are presented in this paper.

The magnetic field significantly decreases the size of γ’ and the content of γ-γ’ eutectic. The formation of <b>macro-segregation</b> under a weak magnetic field was attributed to the interdendritic solute transport driven by the thermoelectric magnetic convection (TEMC).

40|$|Movement {{of solid}} {{crystals}} {{in the form}} of dendrite fragments causes severe <b>macro-segregation</b> in solidified products. Dendrite fragmentation in the developing mushy zone occurs as a result of remelting (causing dissolution) and subsequent breakage of dendritic side arms from the dendritic stalks.

40|$|Solving the {{non-linear}} thermo-metallurgical problem such as {{the thermal}} cooling of a molten metal or the <b>macro-segregation</b> during a cooling process are problems that needs careful consideration. The strong non-linearities of the problem {{makes it difficult to}} solve without having a prohibitive high cost arising from the high spatial and time-domain discretization needed to solve the problem. For the studied application of design optimization of cast components a low computational time is important since a lot of computations are necessary in an optimization. From the first law of thermodynamics we derive a space-time FE-discretization for a hierarchy of discontinuous Galerkin in time, dG(k) k>= 0. This formulation integrates the stored energy exact. As a special case we regain the enthalpy-method with suitable average of the energy generation over time. For the <b>macro-segregation,</b> the problem is reformulated so that the phase-transition drives a flow of species. Diffusion is possible throughout the domain in this model. This can then be further rewritten using a potential approach. We can by this aproch arrive in discretizations that guaranties that the balance equation is satisfied and can solve phase-transition problem as a field problem or as a local problem.

40|$|Some {{properties}} of the ingot and especially of the steel forging ingots depend on the ratio of a columnar structure area to an equiaxed structure area created during solidification. The C-E transition is fundamental phenomenon {{that can be applied}} to characterize massive cast steel ingots produced by the casting house. The mentioned ratio is created spontaneously due to the rate of heat transfer towards the ceramic mould and then to the environment. The ceramic mould operates as an isolator. So that the thickness of the mould together with a growing solid fraction control the heat transfer and finally the ratio of the columnar structure area to the equiaxed structure area. At first the increase of heat accumulation within the ceramic mould is observed. Next the stationary state for heat transfer is created and finally a gentle abatement of the mould temperature associated with the heat output to the environment is expected. The steep thermal gradients correspond to the increase of heat accumulation in the ceramic mould. The steep thermal gradients are required to promote the columnar structure formation. The full heat accumulation in the mould corresponds well with the C-E transformation while the appearance of the moderate thermal gradients is referred to the gentle temperature abatement within the ceramic mould. The equiaxed structure is expected within this period of heat transfer behavior. The steep thermal gradients involve the activity of viscosity gradient in the liquid. As the result a sedimentary cones are formed {{at the bottom of the}} ingot. The C-E transformation is associated with competition between columnar and equaixed structure formation. At the end of competition a fully equiaxed structure is formed. The viscosity gradient is replaced by the thermophoresis which is the driving force for the deposition of some equiaxed grain layers onto the surface of C+E zone. The convection together with the gravity allow the layers to be uniform along the whole height of the ingot. Some equiaxed grain layers are also deposited at the bottom of ingot onto the surface of sedimentary cones due to activity of the gravity. Additionally, some <b>macro-segregation</b> effects are observed in the ingot. There are “A” – type <b>macro-segregation</b> phenomenon and „V” – type <b>macro-segregation</b> phenomenon. Both mentioned phenomena result from the so-called canal micro-segregation which appears due to the deposition of the equiaxed grains onto the bottom of ingot. Micro-fissures, porosity and micro-shrinkage are the result of the segregation phenomena occurring during the ingot solidification. Three ranges within the temperature filed created in the ceramic mould are to be distinguished:a/ for the formation of columnar structure (the C – zone) : (0 T and steep thermal gradients in the liquid),b/ for the EC transition (columnar to fully equiaxed structure) : (0 T and the so-called critical thermal gradient in the liquid),c/ for the formation of fully equiaxed structure (the E – zone) : (0 T and moderate thermal gradients in the liquid) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{detached}} growth mechanism {{has been}} proposed, {{which is similar}} to that proposed by Duffar et al. and used to study the current detached growth system. From numerical results, we can conclude that detached growth will more likely appear if the growth and wetting angles are large and meniscus is flat. Detached thickness is dependent on growth angle, wetting angle, and gap width and shape of the fins. The model can also explain why the detached growth will not happen for metals in which the growth angle is almost zero. Since the growth angle of CdZnTe cannot be changed, to promote detached growth, the number density of the fins should be low and the wetting angle should be high. Also, a much smaller gap width of the fins should be used in the ground experiment and the detached gap width is much smaller. The shape of the fins has minor influence on detached growth. An integrated numerical model for detached solidification has been developed combining a global heat transfer sub-model and a wall contact sub-model. The global heat transfer sub-model accounts for heat and mass transfer in the multiphase system, convection in the melt, <b>macro-segregation,</b> and interface dynamics. The location and dynamics of the solidification interface are accurately tracked by a multizone adaptive grid generation scheme. The wall contact sub-model accounts for the meniscus dynamics at the three-phase boundary. Simulations have been performed for crystal growth in a conventional ampoule and a designed ampoule to understand the benefits of detached solidification and its impacts on crystalline structural quality, e. g., stoichiometry, <b>macro-segregation,</b> and stress.

40|$|Channel segregation, {{which is}} {{featured}} by the strip-like shape with compositional variation in cast materials due to density contrast-induced flow during solidification, frequently causes the severe destruction of homogeneity and some fatal damage. An investigation of its mechanism {{sheds light on}} the understanding {{and control of the}} channel segregation formation in solidifying metals, such as steels. Until now, it still remains controversial what composes the density contrasts and, to what extent, how it affects channel segregation. Here we discover a new force of inclusion flotation that drives the occurrence of channel segregation. It originates from oxide-based inclusions (Al 2 O 3 /MnS) and their sufficient volume fraction-driven flotation becomes stronger than the traditionally recognized inter-dendritic thermosolutal buoyancy, inducing the destabilization of the mushy zone and dominating the formation of channels.

40|$|Multi-faceted {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} measure the properties of several mold slags, needed for fundamental characterization of heat transfer and friction in the interfacial gap between the shell and mold during the continuous casting of steel. A novel apparatus {{was used to measure}} the friction coefficient between solidified mold flux and copper at elevated temperatures. The measured softening temperature is interpreted to extrapolate the slag viscosity-temperature curves far into the low temperature – high viscosity region. Continuous-cooling transformation curves were extracted from XRD analysis of DSC test samples and thermocouple dip tests. Time-temperature transformation curves were obtained from similar analysis of melted mold powder samples that were atomized into droplets, quenched to form glass, and then partially devitrified by reheating to different temperatures for different times and quenched. Polarized light microscopy, SEM, and EDX analysis revealed distinct crystalline and glassy layers, but no severe <b>macro-segregation</b> in a tail-out slag film taken from an operating caster. The results from these new measurements have important implications for the prediction of interfacial gap phenomena, including mold heat transfer, friction, slag layer fracture, and steel surface quality...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAim of {{the present}} work is to {{investigate}} mechanical and metallurgical characteristics of continuous wave CO 2 laser welded dissimilar couple of AISI 304 stainless steel and commercially pure copper sheets in autogenous mode. Metallurgical analysis of the fusion zone {{has been done to}} understand the mixing and solidification behavior. Macroscopic examination has been carried out to observe the <b>macro-segregation</b> pattern of Cu, Fe and Cr rich phases in different zones, and the thickness of HAZ was found to be around 10 [*]µm. The micro-channels formed from the steel side to weld pool describe that the copper solidifies first and provides the nucleation surface for the residual melt to grow. These tubular micro-channels formed may be due to carbide precipitation. The EDS analysis conforms the well mixing of SS and Cu inside the weld pool. The mechanical properties in terms of tensile stress found up to 201 [*]MPa and the fracture are obtained outside the weld zone. Microhardness measurements over the fusion zone have been done to understand the keyhole growth and quenching, solidification sequence and stress distribution over the full area...|$|E
40|$|In {{secondary}} AlSi alloys, {{the presence}} of small amounts of Fe causes the formation of intermetallic phases, which {{have a negative effect}} on mechanical and physical properties of castings. To understand the effect of fluid flow on the microstructure and intermetallic phases, Al- 5 / 7 / 9 wt pct Si 0. 2 / 0. 5 / 1. 0 wt pct Fe alloys have been directionally solidified under defined thermal (gradient 3 K/mm, solidification velocity 0. 04 mm/s) and fluid flow (rotating magnetic field 6 mT) conditions. The primary α-Al phase and intermetallic phases were studied using light microscopy and SEM with EDX. The influence of fluid flow and intermetallic phases (β- Al 5 FeSi) on microstructure was characterized by changes of primary and secondary dendrite arm spacing and specific surface area of the dendrites. We observe a pronounced effect of flow on the length of the intermetallic precipitates, a <b>macro-segregation</b> Fe and Si and even small amounts of iron and thus intermetallics reduce possible effects of flow on microstructural parameters...|$|E
