METHODS: Forty-four patients with early RA were randomized to receive MTX alone (MTX group), MTX plus <b>IV</b> <b>MP</b> (<b>IV</b> <b>MP</b> group), or MTX plus infliximab (infliximab group), infused on day 0 and weeks 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, and 46. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI scans of the metacarpophalangeal joints, wrists, and metatarsophalangeal joints were performed at baseline, week 18, and week 52. RESULTS: Scores for MRI-detected synovitis and bone edema improved over time in the 3 groups, with significantly lower synovitis scores in the infliximab group compared with the MTX group and significantly lower bone edema scores in the infliximab group compared with the MTX and the <b>IV</b> <b>MP</b> groups. Scores for MRI-detected erosion significantly increased over time in all groups. There were no differences in erosion scores between the MTX group and the other groups. It is of note that patients treated with <b>IV</b> <b>MP</b> showed more significant progression in MRI-detected erosions compared with patients treated with infliximab. At week 22, response rates according to the American College of Rheumatology 20 % improvement criteria (ACR 20), the ACR 50, and the ACR 70 were significantly higher in both the <b>IV</b> <b>MP</b> group and the infliximab group compared with the MTX group. At week 52, remission was achieved in 40 % of patients in the MTX group and in 70 % of patients in the <b>IV</b> <b>MP</b> and infliximab groups. Health Assessment Questionnaire scores improved significantly over time in all groups, with patients receiving <b>IV</b> <b>MP</b> experiencing significantly more improvement compared with patients treated with MTX alone. No severe side effects were observed, except 1 case of MTX-related pneumonitis. CONCLUSION: The combination of MTX and infliximab is superior to MTX alone for reducing MRI-detected signs of synovitis and bone edema in patients with early RA.

Although a number of mutations of the GALNS gene of <b>MPS</b> <b>IV</b> A patients have been described, pathogenesis of the disorder still remains elusive. In order to facilitate in vivo studies using model animals for <b>MPS</b> <b>IV</b> A, we isolated and performed molecular characterization of the mouse homolog of human GALNS. The 2. 3 -kb cDNA contains a 1560 -bp open reading frame encoding 520 amino acid residues. The coding region has 84 % similarity to the human GALNS cDNA at amino acid level. The mouse Galns gene was mapped by interspecific backcross analysis to the distal region of chromosome 8 where it co-segregates with Aprt. Northern blot analysis showed a wide expression of a single-copy gene, being higher especially in liver and kidney. The Galns gene was isolated from S 129 vJ genomic library and its genomic organization was characterized. The mouse Galns gene was about 50 -kb long and organized into 14 exons and 13 introns.

40|$|Background: Thoracolumbar {{kyphosis}} {{has been}} considered as the first presenting deformity and is often a key diagnostic clue noted in children with mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type IV (Morquio′s syndrome). However, we observed that the progressive irregularities of the epiphyses of the long bones were the most prominent skeletal pathology, causing effectively the development of diverse forms of lower limbs deformities with extreme variation in age of onset. Materials and Methods: Ten patients (seven children and three adults) {{with an average age}} of 15 years have been enrolled in this study. Age of diagnosis of MPS IVA has a variable age of onset and a MISLEADING rate of severity. Hip dislocations, genu valgum, protrusio acetabuli and osteoarthritis were the most common lower limbs deformities in these patients. Clinical and radiographic phenotypes were the baseline tools of documentation. Urinary screening and genotypic characterizations have been applied accordingly. Results: Combined pelvic and femoral procedures for hip dislocation, epiphysiodeses and supracondylar osteotomy for genu valgum and hip arthroplasty for protrusio acetabuli have been performed. All patients manifested insufficient activity of N-acetylgalactosamine- 6 -sulphate sulphatase, an enzyme that degrades keratin sulphate and chondroitin- 6 sulphate. Conclusion: The extensive clinical heterogeneity contributed significantly in the delay in establishing the diagnosis particularly in adult patients with <b>MPS</b> <b>IV.</b> The epiphyseal irregularities of the long bones and the progressive flattening pathology of <b>MPS</b> <b>IV</b> A were the reason to falsely diagnose some patients as spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenital and/or tarda.

40|$|Background : Corticosteroids are {{commonly}} used {{in the management of}} acute asthma. However, studies comparing various steroids in the management of acute asthma are lacking. Objective : To compare the efficacy and safety of two treatment regimens - intravenous (<b>IV)</b> methylprednisolone (<b>MP)</b> followed by oral <b>MP</b> and <b>IV</b> hydrocortisone (HC) followed by oral prednisolone in acute bronchial asthma patients. Materials and Methods : This was a randomized, prospective study performed in the emergency department (ED) of a tertiary care hospital in North India. A total of 94 patients with acute asthma were randomly allocated to either of the two treatment groups: Group A (n = 49) or Group B (n = 45). Patients in Group A were administered HC 200 mg IV 6 -hourly until discharge from the ED, followed by oral prednisolone 0. 75 mg/kg daily for 2 weeks. Patients in Group B were administered <b>MP</b> 125 mg <b>IV</b> bolus, followed by 40 mg <b>MP</b> <b>IV</b> 6 -hourly until discharge, and then oral MP 0. 6 mg/kg daily for 2 weeks. All clinical variables, peak expiratory flow (PEF) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) were assessed at baseline, at 1, 3 and 6 h and at every 6 h thereafter until discharge from the ED. The patients were followed-up after 2 weeks of discharge. The response to treatment was assessed by clinical and spirometric evaluation. Independent t-tests and chi-square tests were used to compare the two treatment regimens. Results : The baseline characteristics were comparable in the two groups. There was a significant improvement in PEF and FEV 1 within the groups at 2 weeks of treatment when compared to the baseline. At 2 weeks of follow-up, Group B showed significant improvement over Group A in PEF (P < 0. 0001), FEV 1 (P < 0. 0001) and asthma score (P = 0. 034).

40|$|Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are {{characterized}} by mental retardation constantly present in the severe forms of Hurler (MPS I), Hunter (MPS II) and Sanfilippo (MPS III) diseases. On the contrary, mental retardation is absent in Morquio (<b>MPS</b> <b>IV)</b> and Maroteaux-Lamy (MPS VI) diseases and absent or only minimal in the attenuated forms of MPS I, II and III. Considering that MPS patients affected by mental disease accumulate heparan sulfate (HS) due to specific enzymatic defects, we hypothesized a possible correlation between urinary HS-derived glucosamine (GlcN) accumulated in tissues and excreted in biological fluids and mental retardation. 83 healthy subjects were found to excrete HS {{in the form of}} fragments due to the activity of catabolic enzymes that are absent or impaired in MPS patients. On the contrary, urinary HS in 44 patients was observed to be composed of high molecular weight polymer and fragments of various lengths depending on MPS types. On this basis we correlated mental retardation with GlcN belonging to high and low molecular weight HS. We demonstrate a positive relationship between the accumulation of high molecular weight HS and mental retardation in MPS severe compared to attenuated forms. This is also supported by the consideration that accumulation of other GAGs different from HS, as in <b>MPS</b> <b>IV</b> and MPS VI, and low molecular weight HS fragments do not impact on central nervous system disease...|$|E
40|$|Background: Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a {{group of}} rare {{inherited}} disorders characterized by abnormal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) within the myocytes and coronary arteries. Little is known about hyperlipidaemia as a potential cardiovascular risk factor in these patients. Baseline cholesterol data in adults are scarce. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to analyse factors affecting lipid profile in different types of MPSs to determine if abnormalities in lipid profile contribute to the overall risk of cardiovascular disease. Methods: Adult patients (above the age of 16) with MPS type I, II, III, IV and VI attending clinics in two Inherited Metabolic Disorders centres were included. Their lipid profile, lipoprotein (a), HbA 1 c, Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT), BMI and treatment type were extracted. Analysis included descriptive statistics and Student t-test. Results: Eighty two patients with five MPS types (I, II, III, IV and VI) were included in the study; 29 were females (35 %) and 53 were males (65 %). BMI above 25  kg/m 2 in all MPS types indicated that some patients were overweight for their height. Only one patient post-HSCT had diabetes. In 3 cases insulin was analysed during GTT and showed no insulin resistance despite raised BMI. Mean total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were below 5  mmol/L and 3  mmol/L, respectively, in five individual MPS types. Lipoprotein (a) was available for 6 <b>MPS</b> <b>IV</b> patients and was not significantly raised. Conclusions: MPS disorders are not associated with significant hypercholesterolaemia or diabetes mellitus despite increased BMI. Total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were within the targets for primary prevention for non-MPS population. Lipoprotein (a) is not a useful marker of cardiovascular disease in a small group of adult <b>MPS</b> <b>IV</b> patients irrespectively of treatment option.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen SSc patients were recruited in the study, 9 based on the severity of their skin involvement (modified Rodnan total skin score [TSS] >or= 15) and 7 based {{on the presence of}} active ILD. Patients received 3 consecutive daily <b>IV</b> <b>MP</b> pulses, followed by 5 additional monthly <b>IV</b> <b>MP</b> pulses. MMF (0. 5 g bid for one week; then, 1 g bid) and low-dose (5 - 10 mg/day) oral prednisolone were prescribed for one year. Patients were assessed at baseline, month 6 and 12. Statistics were by ANOVA. RESULTS: TSS and Health Assessment Questionnaire significantly improved over time. In ILD patients, the vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity significantly improved. Although the difference was not statistically significant, ground glass lesions decreased, based on semi-quantitative planimetry analyses performed on chest high-resolution computerized tomography. Toxicity was low and none of the patients suffered from renal crisis.

40|$|Selva, Erica M. Mason, Robert W. Tomatsu, ShunjiMucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are {{lysosomal}} storage disorders {{characterized by}} progressive accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) due to deficiency of specific lysosomal enzymes. MPS are classified {{according to the}} enzyme deficiency and accumulated GAGs. GAGs are negatively charged polysaccharides composed of repeating disaccharides and are important components of extracellular matrix, having a range of functions in multiple tissues. In MPS, GAGs accumulate in lysosomes, disrupting cellular homeostasis and leading to irreversible and progressive cell and tissue damage. All types of MPS are chronic and progressive with an extensive range of clinical manifestations such as skeletal dysplasia, corneal clouding, coarse facial features, joint rigidity or laxity, hepatosplenomegaly, neurodegeneration, and cardiac and respiratory dysfunction. The combined incidence of all MPSs is estimated as 1 : 25, 000 live births. Most patients are asymptomatic at birth, so are not usually diagnosed until signs and symptoms arise {{in the first few}} years of life. Although no cure exists for MPS, some treatment approaches are available, including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), substrate reduction therapy and chaperone therapy. Methods to evaluate treatment success are limited, and there is an overall consensus that treatments should begin before signs and symptoms appear. Current techniques for assessment of disease progression are invasive, and effort-dependent so cannot be used to evaluate young, wheelchair-bound and neurologically impaired patients. Thus, new diagnostic approaches (prenatal to newborn) and better techniques to evaluate disease progression are needed to improve outcomes for patients. ☐ In this study, I have established the efficacy of two non-invasive assessments for measuring disease progression in all <b>MPS</b> <b>IV</b> patients (Chapter 3) and developed a diagnostic approach using GAG analysis by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to understand natural history of MPSs (Chapter 4), and measure efficacy of different treatments (Chapter 5). ☐Skeletal abnormalities in some <b>MPS</b> <b>IV</b> patients precluded examination of bone mineral density (BMD) from conventional body sites, but it was discovered that BMD analysis could be performed on the lateral distal femur (LDF) of all <b>MPS</b> <b>IV</b> patients, regardless of physical or mental ability. Using BMD of LDF it was possible to determine the positive impact of ambulation in preserving BMD. Data from this study provides guidance to patients and their families on the importance of physical exercise in reducing the onset of disability. The subset of non-invasive pulmonary function tests demonstrated that restrictive and obstructive lung diseases are not always present in <b>MPS</b> <b>IV,</b> in which patients have small but functioning lungs. These tests will be able to inform clinicians of disease progression and should be valuable in evaluating the efficacy of treatment, allowing for a much wider range of patients to take part in clinical trials. ☐ The majority of established GAG detection protocols are based on colorimetric assays that are limited by false negative results and also cannot be applied to blood samples. The GAG detection protocol using tandem mass spectrometry is very specific and sensitive, discriminating most MPS patients from unaffected controls at all ages in a variety of samples (amniotic fluid, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, dried blood spots and urine). In my study, the focus was on samples from newborn patients, and results indicate that GAG measurements can be used for newborn screening. This will enable early diagnosis of MPS and thereby allow early treatment to significantly improve outcomes for MPS patients. ☐ I used this tandem mass spectrometry method in a study that showed that HSCT results in better outcomes for MPS II patients than ERT. GAG levels were lower in HSCT treated patients, who also had higher scores in an activity of daily living survey and fewer brain anomalies revealed by MRI than ERT treated patients. These new findings indicate that MPS II patients should be treated with HSCT at an early age and that, contrary to earlier reports, HSCT for these patients can have a positive impact on reducing neurological defects. ☐ The methodologies established here for GAG measurements and non-invasive techniques to assess disease progression have the potential to drastically improve the quality of life for MPS patients. The laboratory test enables both early diagnosis and evaluation of treatment efficacy and the non-invasive assessment protocols can be used to follow clinical efficacy. This highly innovative and state of the art study can be applied to the next generation of patient care in MPSs. The BMD and lung function assessments are also likely to be useful in the management of other diseases unrelated to MPS (skeletal dysplasias or neurological conditions), broadening the impact of this work. Early detection will also impact the choice of the most adequate treatment as well as reduce mortality, morbidity, and public health costs.

Two methods are described by which this approach has been used to produce mutations in M 13 mp 2 phage DNA with high efficiency as a result of simple and rapid in vitro manipulations. Plaques containing mutant phage in a genetically-pure form are obtained at a frequency of 40 - 66 %, allowing their characterisation directly by sequence analysis without prior screening and plaque purification. The wide applicability of this approach is discussed...|$|R
40|$|To date, {{the only}} {{published}} reports of bone mineral density (BMD) in <b>MPS</b> <b>IV</b> involve patients with MPS IVA; no reports exist describing BMD for MPS IVB. In this prospective study of BMD in three patients with MPS IVB, BMD {{was acquired by}} dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at whole body (WB), lumbar spine (LS), and lateral distal femur (LDF). Functional abilities, ambulatory status, medical history, and height z-score were evaluated. Three patients with MPS IVB (two females), aged 17. 7, 31. 4 and 31. 7  years, were evaluated. Every patient was ambulatory and one sustained two fractures caused by trauma. Whole body and hip DXA scans were technically invalid in every patient due {{to the presence of}} prosthetic hip hardware. Lumbar spine was valid in only 1 patient due skeletal abnormalities, and was normal (Z-score of − 0. 8). The LDF was valid in every patient and was low at all three regions of interest: average LDF z-scores were − 3. 1 (range, − 2. 9 to − 3. 6), − 2. 3 (range, − 2. 0 to − 2. 5), and − 2. 1 (range, − 2. 0 to − 2. 3) for region 1 –region 3, respectively. Patients with MPS IVB have low BMD of the lower extremities even with full-time ambulation. Routine body sites to measure by DXA were problematic; hip and WB were invalid due to artifact, and LS had limited utility. The LDF was the only body site consistently available on all patients. Patients did not experience low-energy fractures despite low BMD...|$|E
40|$|Before the {{discovery}} of the lysosome, already three out of the seven currently known mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) were described in medical literature. In 1917, Hunter syndrome was the first to be described in two brothers (“they are as alike as two peas”) by Charles Hunter. Gertrud Hurler published her two case reports about MPS I in 1919, and <b>MPS</b> <b>IV</b> was outlined in 1929 by the Uruguayan dr. Morquio. All described young children with or without mental impairment, with profound bone abnormalities. In 1955, the Belgian scientist Christian de Duve discovered a new intra-cellular organelle that he named the lysosome. Eventually, this brought light to more than 50 inherited diseases all concerning a defect in the lysosomal system. The group of mucopolysaccharidoses belonged to these lysosomal disorders and all types proved to be characterized by the deficiency of a lysosomal enzyme. New types of MPSs were discovered since then. In 1963 two French physicians described a new form of dysostosis mupltiplex, MPS VI, and the syndrome was named after them: Maroteaux-Lamy’s syndrome 4. In the same year dr. Sanfilippo described {{for the first time a}} MPS III patient with mental impairment and excretion of heparan sulphate. Later, Sanfillippo disease was subdivided in type A, B, C, and D because between 1972 and 1980 different enzyme deficiencies were discovered in each of the four subtypes. Finally, in 1973, MPS VII was described by the American dr. Sly. MPS V and MPS VIII, first thought to be novel diseases, later turned out to be already known types of MPS and are not separate entities anymore. In 1996 Natowicz et al reported the first patient with MPS IX. Till now, only one other family has been reported with this disease...|$|E
40|$|Carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} (CTS) {{is a frequent}} syndrome in adults, but is very rare in children. CTS was described in children with mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) as condition due to the deformation of carpal bones, deposition of glycosaminoglycans in tendosynovial tissue and connective tissue of flexor retinaculum. Electromyography is essential method for diagnostic CTS in children because typical symptoms of CTS (paresthesia, numbness of hand and fingers, atrophy and paresis of certain muscles) seen in adults are absent or not realized by children with MPS because of cognitive deficit {{despite the presence of}} nerve involvement. EMG results from 40 children with different types of MPS (age 1 year 8 months to 18 years) are presented. Neurophysiologic abnormalities related to CTS were found in every child with MPS I, in 80, 9 % of cases – with MPS II and in every case – with MPS VI; no EMG signs of median nerve lesions in carpal channel were detected in patients with MPS III and <b>MPS</b> <b>IV.</b> CTS was bilateral in children with MPS I, II and VI, but usually there was an asymmetry of changes. We revealed CTS in one patient with MPS II as early as at the age 2 years 11 months. All children with MPS II had already CTS at the age of 4 years except one patient. Children with MPS I and MPS VI were not investigate before the age 4 years old, but one child 4 years old with MPS I had severe CTS. In children with MPS atrophy of thenar eminence muscles developed rapidly as complication of CTS. Therefore we recommend repeating of EMG regularly to identify earliest signs of median nerve disturbance in carpal channel and opportune surgical decompression of the entrapped nerve. It allows preserving normal function of hand that it is very important for adequate child development and quality of life. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{reactivity}} of cis-[Pd(H 2 O) 2 (PPh 3) 2](TsO) 2. 2 (H 2 O) (I,H 2 O), trans-[Pd(COEt) (TsO) (PPh 3) 2] (II) and trans- [Pd(COOMe) (TsO) (PPh 3) 2] (III) {{has been studied}} by 1 H and 31 P 1 H NMR spectroscopy under conditions that mime the catalytic ethene hydromethoxycarbonylation (EHMC), i. e. {{in the presence of}} PPh 3, H 2 O and TsOH. (I,H 2 O), in the presence of two equivalents of PPh 3, reacts with MeOH and CO (0. 3 MPa) at 193 K to give [Pd(COOMe) (TsO) (PPh 3) 3] (III 0), which reacts with H 2 O in the presence of TsOH at 293 K to generate [PdH(PPh 3) 3](TsO) (IV) quantitatively. This hydride inserts ethene (0. 3 MPa, 293 K) to give trans- [Pd(Et) (TsO) (PPh 3) 2] (V), which reacts with CO (0. 3 MPa, 223 K) giving [Pd(COEt) (PPh 3) 3](TsO) (II) 0 and initiates the catalytic EHMC at 293 K. II, in combination with PPh 3 and TsOH, reacts at 293 K with MeOH with quantitative formation of methyl propanoate (<b>MP)</b> and <b>IV</b> and promotes the catalysis starting from this temperature, under 0. 6 MPa of CO/ethene (1 / 1) when the ratio PPh 3 /TsOH/II is 2 / 6 / 1; upon increasing the PPh 3 /II ratio, the catalytic activity passes through a maximum when the ratio is 4 / 1, even though it initiates at a higher temperature. In the absence of added ligand, MP is formed in a stoichiometric amount, catalysis is not observed and decomposition to Pd metal occurs. Therefore, PPh 3 is essential in order to stabilize hydride IV, though an excess of ligand is detrimental. III does not insert ethene even at 343 K, a temperature well above that at which catalysis is observed. All these experimental evidences support the PdeH cycle...|$|R

Material and methods. 59 pts with tophaceous gout (crystal-verified diagnosis) and arthritis {{of three and}} more joints lasting more than a months in spite of treatment with sufficient doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were included. Median age of pts was 56 [48; 63], median disease duration — 15, 2 years [7, 4; 20], median swollen joint count at the examination — 8 [5; 11]. The patients were randomized into 2 groups. Methylprednisolone (<b>MP)</b> 500 mg/day <b>iv</b> during 2 days and placebo im once was administered in one of them, betamethasone (BM) 7 mg im once and placebo iv twice — in the other. Results. Number of pts with full resolution of arthritis, recurrent exacerbation, insufficient arthritis resolution or clinically insignificant response was comparable in both groups. More rapid decrease of pain at moving was achieved during the first 2 - 3 days after GC administration in pts with full resolution of arthritis (p= 0, 03) in group receiving MP in comparison with BM. At day 14 joint damage measures did not differ between groups. Conclusion. Efficacy of short-term glucocorticoid administration {{does not depend on}} mode of administration and GC medication form (methylprednisolone 500 mg/day iv during 2 days or betamethasone 7 mg im once...|$|R
