Following his <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> halfway house, he was moved to home confinement, and then, on July 25, 2012, Richard Scrushy was released from federal custody.|$|E
5|$|During the 2015 Labour {{leadership}} election, Andy Burnham {{said that}} he would introduce a graduate tax to replace fees. He was ultimately unsuccessful in his bid for leadership. A graduate tax has been criticised because there would be no way to recover the money from students who <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> different country, or foreign students who return home.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 reports emerged that, {{as part of}} {{the plans}} for the renewal of its Royal Charter, the BBC was {{considering}} moving whole channels or strands of production from London to Manchester.

5|$|In January 2001, {{plans were}} drawn up to <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 55,000-seat {{purpose-built}} arena {{on the site}} of the King's Dock in Liverpool. The proposed stadium would have had a retractable roof enabling it to be used for concerts and chairman Bill Kenwright had hoped to have it ready for the 2005–06 season.|$|E
5|$|More {{detailed}} negotiations {{will begin}} with a final approval expected early in 2016. If the final agreement goes ahead, Cardiff Athletic Club would receive an upfront payment of approximately £8 million. As part of the agreement, the bowls section would have to vacate its current site at the Arms Park and <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new facility. At present Cardiff Blues pay Cardiff Athletic Club rent of around £115,000 per annum, however this would nearly double to around £200,000.|$|E
5|$|Ross felt {{strongly}} that the state should adequately care for its veterans. During his first term, the first Confederate home in Texas was dedicated in Austin. Within two years, the facility {{had run out of}} room, so Ross served as chairman of a committee to finance a relocation to a larger facility. By August 1890, the home had collected enough money to <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> larger location.|$|E

5|$|The Flames {{are also}} close {{partners}} with the Alberta Children's Hospital and the Gordon Townsend School housed within. Among the many activities the Flames participate in, the Wheelchair Hockey Challenge with the Townsend Tigers {{has remained a}} highly popular tradition for both {{the players and the}} children involved. In 2010, the Tigers defeated the Flames to <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> perfect 27–0 record since the challenge was first instituted in 1981.|$|E
5|$|The king {{cannot be}} in check, nor can the king pass through squares {{that are under}} attack by enemy pieces, or <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> square where it {{would result in a}} check.

5|$|The <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{new stadium}} was necessitated {{by the terms}} of the loan York City secured from the Football Stadia Improvement Fund to {{purchase}} their Bootham Crescent ground. Planning permission for the current design, put forward by Greenwich Leisure Ltd, was granted in March 2015. Construction is expected to begin in the summer of 2016, for completion in early 2018. In addition to the stadium, the site will house a leisure complex and a community hub.|$|E
50|$|The tournament <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> April-August {{timeframe}} {{from its}} usual April-June timeframe {{to accommodate the}} schedule of the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup held in Canada. It was permanently <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> June/July timeframe in 2016.|$|R
25|$|An {{opposing}} {{piece is}} generally captured by displacement: That is, if <b>a</b> piece <b>moves</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> intersection occupied by an opposing piece, the opposing piece is displaced and {{removed from the}} board. <b>A</b> piece cannot <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> intersection occupied by a friendly piece (that is, a piece controlled by the same player). However, some shooting pieces are unable to capture by displacement, and therefore cannot <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> intersection occupied by an opposing piece.|$|R
50|$|In 2004 Batcheldor <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{research}} {{position at}} Rochester Institute of Technology {{where he also}} taught Physics.

5|$|This bird {{can be seen}} to perch in both {{shrubbery}} {{and even}} trees, something characteristic of the forest rails. The grey-necked wood rail rarely flies, although when it is flushed out, it will generally <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> branch close to the ground. If it is being observed, it is generally cautious.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of her {{grandson}} in August 1963, Calment lived on her own from age 88 until shortly before her 110th birthday, when she decided to <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> nursing home. Her move was precipitated by the winter of 1985 which froze the water pipes in her house (she never used heating in the winter) and caused frostbite in her hands. According to one of her doctors, she had hitherto been healthy but began showing signs of senescence (or aging) at this point.|$|E
5|$|As Palmyra gained {{importance}} to French efforts to pacify the Syrian Desert, a base {{was constructed in}} the village near the Temple of Bel in 1921. In 1929 the general director of antiquities in Syria, Henri Arnold Seyrig, began excavating the ruins and convinced the villagers to <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new, French-built village next to the site. The relocation was completed in 1932; ancient Palmyra was ready for excavation as its villagers settled into the new village of Tadmur. During World War II, the Mandate came {{under the authority of}} Vichy France, who gave permission to Nazi Germany to use the airfield at Palmyra; forces of Free France, backed by British forces, invaded Syria in June 1941, and on 3 July 1941, the British took control over the city {{in the aftermath of a}} battle.|$|E
50|$|In 1916, Plaza College {{was founded}} as an {{independent}} institution in Long Island City. It <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> location in Jackson Heights, in 1970. In July 2014, Plaza College <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new campus on Queens Boulevard in Forest Hills.|$|R
50|$|The club {{subsequently}} <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{field on}} Lavernock Road owned by Fred Davies of Morristown.

50|$|In {{the early}} years it {{took place in the}} paved yard of the castle. Later (1975), it <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> nearby park because of the growing audience. After a few years outdoors, it <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> large marquee where it remains now.|$|R
5|$|By 1907, new {{university}} buildings completely {{surrounded the}} observatory; {{dust from the}} construction clogged meteorological instruments, and at night electric lighting made astronomical work impossible. The Meteorological Office decided to abandon the site and <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new building {{at the north end}} of campus on Bloor Street, trading the original Observatory to the University in exchange for the new parcel of land. There was some discussion regarding what to do with the Cooke telescope, since the Meteorological Office had little use for this purely astronomical instrument. No other use was immediately forthcoming, and the telescope moved along with the Meteorological Office to their new Bloor Street Observatory.|$|E
5|$|Demand persisted for {{a similar}} school in Tonbridge; in July 1888, William J. D. Bryant, {{previously}} an assistant master at Tonbridge School, was named headmaster of Sir Andrew Judd's Commercial School, which opened on 17September at Stafford House in East Street, Tonbridge. The funds were provided by a loan of £13,000 repaid over the next 20years with income from the Judd Foundation (of which The Skinners' Company were trustees), which rapidly increased when the leases on the Sandhills Estate in London were renewed in 1906. The school also benefited from at least £500 per year from the Judd Foundation, after funding for Tonbridge School was reduced. Although established on a tentative basis, the school's early success led to its <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> larger, purpose-built site in south Tonbridge in 1896.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1942 Cardus {{rented a}} small flat in the Kings Cross {{district}} of Sydney, where {{he wrote his}} Ten Composers (1945) and Autobiography (1947). He said later that he found the discipline of writing for seven hours a day difficult at first, but that the process had turned him from a journalist into something more substantial. When later in 1942 his wife announced her intention of sailing from England to join him, Cardus declined to <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> larger flat to accommodate them both, and rented a separate establishment for her a mile away. They dined together once a week, but otherwise continued to lead largely separate lives.|$|E

5|$|Fady can {{not only}} help protect lemurs and their forests under stable {{socioeconomic}} situations, {{but they can also}} lead to discrimination and persecution if a lemur is known to bring bad fortune, for instance, if it walks through town. In other ways, fady does not protect all lemurs equally. For example, although the hunting and eating of certain species may be taboo, other species may not share that same protection and are therefore targeted instead. Fady can vary from village to village within the same region. If people <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new village or region, their fady may not apply to the lemur species that are locally present, making them available for consumption. Fady restrictions on lemur meat can be relaxed in times of famine and drought.|$|E
5|$|Following Walker's death, alumni and {{students}} began {{to raise funds}} to construct a monument {{to him and his}} fifteen years as leader of the university. Although the funds were easily raised, plans were delayed for over two decades as MIT made plans to <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new campus on the western bank of the Charles River in Cambridge. The new Beaux-Arts campus opened in 1916, and featured a neo-classical Walker Memorial building housing a gymnasium, students' club and lounge, and a commons room.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{invocation}} {{and the performance}} of the United States National Anthem, the children of the late sports marketer Ed Shull gave the command for drivers to start their engines. On the pace laps, Johnson, after changing his engine, and teammate Earnhardt, who had to <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> back-up car, had to fall behind all the other drivers in the event after doing major changes during practice. At the start, Newman was the leader going through the first corner, but on the same lap Menard, with pushing assistance from Martin, passed him. On the second lap, the first caution was given because Newman spun sideways in the second turn but avoided impacting the wall. During the caution, he drove to pit road for a pit stop.|$|E
