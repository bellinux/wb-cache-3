One of the most intriguing challenges in <b>mobile</b> <b>apps</b> development is its fragmentation with respect to mobile platforms (e. g., Android, Apple iOS, Windows Phone). Recently, companies like IBM and Adobe and a growing community of developers advocate web-based hybrid <b>mobile</b> <b>apps</b> development as a possible solution to mobile platforms fragmentation. Web-based hybrid <b>mobile</b> <b>apps</b> are consistent across platforms and built on web standards like HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript. This tutorial provides a state of the art overview of the solutions, technologies, and research opportunities related to the development of web-based hybrid <b>mobile</b> <b>apps.</b> Apache Cordova is presented as one of the possible technologies for hybrid apps development.

Mental health <b>mobile</b> <b>apps</b> are emerging technologies that fit under the broad heading of mobile health (mHealth). mHealth, encompassed within electronic health (eHealth), reflects the use of mobile devices {{for the practice of}} public health. Well-designed mental health <b>mobile</b> <b>apps</b> that present content in interactive, engaging, and stimulating ways can promote cognitive learning, personal growth, and mental health enhancement. As key influencers in the mental health social system, counselor educators and professional associations may either help or hinder diffusion of beneficial mHealth technologies. As mental health <b>mobile</b> <b>apps</b> move towards ubiquity, research will continue to be conducted. The studies published thus far, combined with the potential of mental health <b>mobile</b> <b>apps</b> for learning and personal growth, offer enough evidence to compel mental health professionals to infuse these technologies into education and practice. Counselor educators and professional associations must use their influential leadership roles to train students and practitioners in how to research, evaluate, and integrate mental health <b>mobile</b> <b>apps</b> into practice. The objectives of this article are to (1) increase awareness of mHealth and mental health <b>mobile</b> <b>apps,</b> (2) demonstrate the potential for continued growth in mental health <b>mobile</b> <b>apps</b> based on technology use and acceptance theory, mHealth organizational initiatives, and evidence about how humans learn, (3) discuss evidence-based benefits of mental health mobil...|$|R
