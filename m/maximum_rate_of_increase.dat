Model (1) is a periodic system with 1 -year period. For the breeding season, its length is T_ 1 and the <b>maximum</b> increasing <b>rate</b> is r_ 1, so the <b>maximum</b> finite <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> is e^r_ 1 T_ 1. For the non-breeding season, its length is T_ 2 and the <b>maximum</b> increasing <b>rate</b> is -r_ 2, so the <b>maximum</b> finite <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> is e^ - r_ 2 T_ 2. Therefore, during one period, the <b>maximum</b> finite <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> is e^r_ 1 T_ 1 e^ - r_ 2 T_ 2, {{and this is the}} quantity R_ 0. In model (9), which is derived from the logistic model and in which the rodent are subject to impulse contraception control, {{the condition of}} positive equilibrium existing and being stable is q< 1 -e^-r U, namely, (1 -q)e^r U > 1.

5000|$|An {{interesting}} {{property of}} purging is that, during inbreeding, while [...] increases approaching a final value , [...] can approach {{a much smaller}} final value. Hence, {{it is not just}} that purging slows the fitness decline, but also that it reduces the overall fitness loss produced by inbreeding in the long term. This is illustrated in BOX 2 for the extreme case of inbreeding depression caused by recessive lethals, which are alleles that cause death before reproduction but only when they occur in homozygosis. Purging is less effective against mildly deleterious alleles than against lethal ones but, in general, the slower is the increase of inbreeding , the smaller becomes the final value of the purged inbreeding coefficient [...] and, therefore, the final reduction in fitness. This implies that, if inbreeding progresses slowly enough, no relevant inbreeding depression is expected in the long term. This results in the fitness of a small population, that has been a small population for a long time, can be the same as a large population with more genetic diversity. In conservation genetics, it would be very useful to ascertain the <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> of inbreeding that allows for such efficient purging.|$|E

Three groups of estrous cycles were analyzed: resulting in pregnancy, not resulting in pregnancy and resulting in lost pregnancy. The aim {{of the study was to}} identify a complex of progesterone profile features associated with successful insemination. The features used were (1) from the estrous cycle preceding the artificial insemination: estrus progesterone concentration, post-estrus <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> in progesterone, luteal phase peak, pre-estrus maximum rate of decline in progesterone and the length of follicular and luteal phase and (2) from the estrous cycle following insemination: estrus progesterone concentration, post-estrus <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> in progesterone and days from estrus to post-estrus <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> in progesterone. A discriminant analysis did not reveal clear differences between the groups. However, the analysis correctly classified 75 % of true pregnant cows. Conversely, only 60 % of not pregnant animals were classified as such by the discriminate analysis. Individual analysis of progesterone profile features in pregnant and not pregnant groups of estrous cycles showed that a shorter follicular phase preceding insemination is associated with proper timing of post-ovulatory luteinisation and therefore is more likely to result in pregnancy...|$|E

The lift increases while cavitation is weak comparatively, and the more angle of attack enlarges, the more <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> lift due to cavitation is extended. At the angle of attack is 10 degrees, the maximum lift is about 15 % above non-cavitation. As the cavitation develops strongly, the lift begins to fall off gradually, and when the length of cavitation along upper surface of hydro-foil develops more than 80 % {{of the length of}} chord, the lift drops below non-cavitation. On the other hand, the drag increases as soon as cavitation inception occurs, and on the fully developed cavitation, the drag also drops below noncavitation. The maximum <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> drag due to cavitation is from 20 to 30 % above non-cavitation, and it is far larger than the <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> lift. On the experiments, two hydro-foils were prepared, the thickness are 16 % and 12 % of chord respectively. For the smaller angle of attack, cavitation inception is easy to occur on the thicker hydro-foil than on the thiner.

Estimated whaling mortality was unsustainable from 1928 to 1972 (except during 1942 – 1944), depleting them from 239, 000 (95 % interval 202, 000 – 311, 000) {{to a low of}} 360 (150 – 840) in 1973. Obtaining statistical evidence for subsequent increases has proved difficult due to their scarcity. We fitted Bayesian models to three sighting series (1968 – 2001), constraining <b>maximum</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> to 12 % per annum.

40|$|Inhibition of D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) {{activity}} {{is a potential}} target {{for the treatment of}} chronic pain. Here we characterized the effects of systemic administration of the DAAO inhibitor 4 H-furo[3, 2 -b]pyrrole- 5 -carboxylic acid (SUN) in rat models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain. Oral administration of SUN dose dependently attenuated tactile allodynia induced by ligation of the L 5 spinal nerve (SNL) and similarly reversed thermal hyperalgesia produced by chronic constriction injury. In addition, SUN was efficacious against complete Freund’s adjuvant-induced thermal hyperalgesia. In these models, maximal reversal of pain-related behaviors corresponded with <b>maximum</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> in brain and plasma D-serine concentrations, indicative of full inhibition of DAAO activity. To investigate the possible site(s) of action, we recorded spontaneous nerve activity and mechanically evoked responses of central spinal cord dorsal horn neurons and compared these with spontaneous activity of peripheral dorsal root filaments in anesthetized SNL model animals. Oral SUN reduced spontaneous activity in both central and peripheral recordings at doses and pretreatment times that corresponded to reduced mechanical allodynia in behavioral experiments. After intravenous administration of SUN, the onset of action for this central effect was rapid (maximal effects within 30 minutes), but was abolished by severing afferent inputs to the dorsal horn. Overall, these results indicate that inhibition of DAAO in peripheral afferent spinal circuits reduced spontaneous neuronal activity to attenuate pain-related behaviors in rat models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain...|$|R

Thermal effluent regulations in place to protect these ecosystems restrict thermoelectric power generation when water temperatures are too warm. Climate change projections forecast increased precipitation intensities, a trend that has already been observed in the past century. Though extreme events are becoming more common, the stream temperature response to high-intensity rainfall is not yet well understood. Precipitation (33) and stream temperature records (52) from gages in the Upper Midwestern United States were analyzed to determine whether there exists a positive relationship between high-intensity rainfall and warming stream temperature response. This region was chosen for its already observed trends in increasing precipitation intensity, and both urban and rural gages were used in order to account for the effect of impervious surfaces on runoff amounts and temperature. Days with recorded precipitation were divided by an intensity threshold and classified as either high-intensity or moderate-intensity days. While the effects of rain events on stream temperature are variable, increases in stream temperature in response to high-intensity rainfall were observed. For some basins, daily <b>maximum</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> stream temperature <b>increase</b> were, on average, greater for higher intensity events.

Results are described {{from an individual}} based model (IBM) with spatially localized dispersal and competition, and from a deterministic approximation to the IBM describing {{the dynamics of the}} first and spatial moments.

40|$|We want to {{talk now}} about {{population}} principles; this is our main problem dealing with populations. We should discuss the general application of population principles and the management of bird populations. The reason we can discuss this is because many species follow established principles; population growth and later regulation of its size follow certain basic rules. Many pest species follow these principles, but not always to the letter. Populations of different species, {{as well as of}} a species, vary depending upon local conditions. Local environments dictate what population levels and the growth of populations will be. Minor variabilities still fit into the general picture. To apply these principles we must consider the level of reduction desired in the pest population. This is determined usually by 1) eco¬nomic damage or 2) disease potential or much too often by 3) the budget. You can go from a complete reduction or local eradication of a species to a very minor change in the population level depending upon the methods you use.

We can describe the theoretical natural growth of a number of animals compared to time by what we call an 2 ̆ 2 S 2 ̆ 2 shape or sigmoid curve. This shape {{is the result of a}} change in the rate of increase in the population.

During the warming process, {{the rate of increase}} of temperature of the mixture is monitored by, for example, thermocouple (28) with the thermocouple output signal being amplified and differentiated by a differentiator (42). The rate of increase of temperature data are analyzed and a peak rate of increase of temperature is identified. In the preferred device (10) a computer (22) is utilized to analyze the rate of increase of temperature data following the warming process. Once the <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> of temperature is identified, the corresponding temperature of the mixture is located and earmarked as being substantially equal to the freezing point of the mixture. In a preferred device (10), the computer (22), in addition to collecting the temperature and rate of change of temperature data, controls a programmable power supply (14) to provide a predetermined amount of cooling and warming current to thermoelectric modules (56) ...|$|E
40|$|Nutritional {{and light}} {{requirements}} {{for growth and}} synthesis of RNA, DNA, and protein by cotyledons excised from 5 -day-old seedlings of Raphanus sativus L. were investigated, and the course of synthesis was followed through the cell cycle. The minimum requirements for a net increase in nucleic acid and protein were sugar, nitrate, and light. The cotyledons used nitrite at low concentration, but not ammonium ion. Light was required for preliminary steps in synthesis of RNA, DNA, and protein, but the actual polymerization reactions occurred in the dark. The cotyledons contained sufficient endogenous growth factors for {{about half of the}} cells to complete 1 cycle on a medium of 1 % sucrose, 80 mm KNO 3. The increase in DNA was limited to about 50 % and was accompanied by a comparable increase in cell number. Fresh weight, RNA, and protein tended to increase in proportion to DNA. Growth of the isolated cotyledons commenced with cell enlargement. RNA began to increase after about 4 hours, DNA after about 12. The major increase in protein also began at about 12 hours. The <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> for all 3 occurred between 12 and 16 hours. Cell counts indicated that by 28 hours most of the cells which had replicated DNA had also completed cell division...|$|E
40|$|Extract] The {{conservation}} {{status of the}} Irrawaddy dolphin, Orcaella brevirostris, population in Chilika Lagoon, India (Fig. 1 A) has not been assessed using the IUCN Red List criteria, but five other subpopulations of the Irrawaddy dolphin are listed as Critically Endangered (IUCN 2009). These subpopulations are small, isolated and live in human-dominated environments; most subpopulations have fewer than 50 mature individuals (IUCN 2009). A robust estimation of abundance is {{a key factor in}} assessing {{conservation status}} and to inform future conservation policy for Irrawaddy dolphins in Chilika Lagoon. Estimating abundance to predict trends in small populations of marine mammals is particularly difficult (Aragones et al. 1997, Taylor et al. 2007, Dawson et al. 2008) because (1) detection probability is affected by observer and sea state variables and (2) increases in population size are typically slow due to the low <b>maximum</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> cetacean populations. There are no similar constraints on population decline, but in the absence of catastrophes, most declines are also likely to be relatively slow and difficult to detect (Taylor and Gerrodette 1993) ...|$|R
40|$|There are maturational {{changes of}} {{myocardial}} function {{and response to}} inotropic agents. Because of incomplete myocardial sympathetic innervation, neonatal myocardium may {{be more sensitive to}} norepinephrine than is adult myocardium. We tested this hypothesis by using isolated trabecular muscle from two groups of puppies and from adult dogs. The muscles were exposed to norepinephrine at concentrations of 1 × 10 − 10 to 1 × 10 − 4 M, and indices of isometric and isotonic contraction were measured. Active tension and <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> contraction <b>increased</b> in all age groups with norepinephrine. Adult dogs were more sensitive than puppies to the arrhythmogenic effect of norepinephrine. Although there was no strictly significant difference statistically, there appeared to be an age-related increase in the dose at which 50 % of the maximum effect of the drug was achieved (ED 50). Total contraction time, time to peak tension, and relaxation time decreased with <b>increasing</b> concentrations <b>of</b> norepinephrine in older puppies and in adults but not in newborn puppies. Thus, there are significant age-related differences in response to norepinephrine...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of the {{different}} densities of Chlorella vulgaris (0. 05 x 106, 0. 1 x 106, 0. 2 x 106, 0. 4 x 106, or 0. 8 x 106 cells/ml) and Scenedesmus subspicatus (0. 05 x 106, 0. 1 x 106, 0. 2 x 106, or 0. 4 x 106 cells/ml) on culture of the water flea, Bosmina longirostris, were investigated. The experiment was carried out in a photoperiod of 16 h light: 8 h dark at 25 ± 1 °C. At the beginning of the experiment, one B. longirostris individual (< 24 h old) was put into each vessel, and the number <b>of</b> individuals and <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> population <b>increase</b> were determined for 30 days. Increasing the food density <b>increased</b> the number <b>of</b> individuals and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> population.
