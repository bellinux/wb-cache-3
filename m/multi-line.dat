40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} flexibility and reduce costs, assembly systems are changing from simple mixed-model assembly lines, to <b>multi-lines</b> systems, where some components are assembled in secondary lines, called feeder lines, connected to the main line by a “pull philosophy”. The production of different models in such a complex <b>multi-lines</b> assembly system, where, the tasks to perform could {{be very different from}} model to model, impacts the production with very high workload time variations, with the consequence of lack of productivity. If operators can perform tasks on different stations on both the feeder and the main lines these time variations can generally be absorbed. But if working across the stations’ is not possible (closed stations), the balancing of these workload time variations becomes critical. In such contexts the consolidated approach, that allows to configure mixed-model-multi lines assembly system with a single average model representative of the whole mix, can be very limited and is unable to bring substantial results. This paper aims to introduce an innovative sequencing model for mixed-model-multi-lines system, in case of closed stations, in which is possible to obtain, after a first long term configuration, a short term balancing, using an appropriate sequencing, for a given production mix and characteristics of the assembly system. The proposed procedure is applied to un-paced assembly lines and validated through simulation and industrial applications...|$|R

Because SOT/SP is free from the seeing eect and has better spatial resolution, we were able to resolve small magnetic polarities with sizes of 100 to 200, and could detect strong horizontal magnetic elds, which converge or diverge in negative or positive facular polarities. These ndings support models which suggest existence of small vertical ux tube bundles in faculae.

MATLAB with Simulink and SIM POWER SYSTEMS tools are used for simulation of Transmission lines and IPFC in open loop and closed loop configurations. A common DC link within the IPFC is able to facilitate real power transfer among the lines of the transmission system. Also each inverter can provide reactive power compensation independently. IPFC is developed with the objective of balancing real and reactive power flow among <b>multi-lines</b> and to transfer power from overloaded to under loaded lines. Second objective of IPFC is to compensate against reactive voltage drops and the corresponding reactive line power, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the compensating system against dynamic disturbances.

The high-precision, large-scale, real-time interaction of simulation has been a goal of researchers. How to coordinate these parameters according to demand, and optimize algorithms and frameworks are currently a hot research. This paper presents {{the idea of using}} real scene modeling technique to develop large-scale urban rail transit driving simulation system.

40|$|Magnetic {{fields of}} cool stars can be {{directly}} investigated through {{the study of the}} Zeeman effect on photospheric spectral lines using several approaches. With spectroscopic measurement in unpolarised light, the total magnetic flux averaged over the stellar disc can be derived but very little information on the field geometry is available. Spectropolarimetry provides a complementary information on the large-scale component of the magnetic topology. With Zeeman-Doppler Imaging (ZDI), this information can be retrieved to produce a map of the vector magnetic field at the surface of the star, and in particular to assess the relative importance of the poloidal and toroidal components as well as the degree of axisymmetry of the field distribution. The development of high-performance spectropolarimeters associated with <b>multi-lines</b> techniques and ZDI allows us to explore magnetic topologies throughout the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram, on stars spanning a wide range of mass, age and rotation period. These observations bring novel constraints on magnetic field generation by dynamo effect in cool stars. In particular, the study of solar twins brings new insight on the impact of rotation on the solar dynamo, whereas the detection of strong and stable dipolar magnetic fields on fully convective stars questions the precise role of the tachocline in this process.

40|$|A {{technological}} {{revolution is}} occurring {{in the field of}} fiber lasers. Over the past two years, the level of power has increased from approx. 100 watts to nearly 1 kilowatt. We are developing a novel fiber laser system, which is a satellite-based LIDAR transmitter of <b>multi-lines.</b> The system is made of a hollow fiber filled with micro-spheres doped with lasing materials. Each sphere has its inherent optical cavity, which makes the system a cavity free and in the same time, emits multi-laser lines for simultaneous multi-task operations. The system is also rugged, compact, lightweight, and durable. Our earlier studies on micro-spheres doped with different laser dyes demonstrated the emission of extremely fine laser lines of less than 3 A line-width, which are of interest for spectroscopic applications, sensing, imaging, and optical communications. Individual dye-doped micro-spheres demonstrated a lasing resonance peaks phenomenon in their fluorescence spectra of linear and nonlinear features that do not exist in the bulk dye solutions. Each individual micro-sphere acts as a laser system with inherent cavity, where the fluorescence line suffers multiple internal reflections within the micro-sphere and gains enough energy to become a laser line. Such resonance peaks are dependent on the sphere's morphology, size, shape, and its refractive index. These resonance peaks are named structural resonance, whispering modes or whispering gallery modes, creeping waves, circumferential waves, surfaces modes, and virtual modes. All of these names refer to the same phenomenon of morphology dependent resonance (MDR), which has already been described and predicted precisely by electromagnetic theory and Lorentz-Mie theory since 1908. The resonance peaks become more obvious when the particle size approaches and exceeds the wavelength of the laser used and the relative index of the particle is greater than that of the surrounding medium.
