Suburban services, which had never been considered important at Paddington, were increased as new housing estates in the Home Counties started being built. Bishop's Road station was rebuilt, giving an extra four platforms to Paddington (Nos.13–16) and providing a new ticket office and entrance for suburban services next to the bridge. A public address system was introduced in 1936.

40|$|Most {{object-oriented}} systems lack two useful facilities: {{the ability}} of objects to migrate to new environments, and {{the ability of}} objects to acquire new operations dynamically. This paper proposes Knos, an object-oriented environment which supports these actions. Their operations, data structures, and communication mechanisms are discussed. Kno objects "learn" by exporting and importing new or modified operations. The use of such objects as intellectual support tools is outlined. In particular, various applications involving co-operation, negotiation, and apprenticeship among objects are described. 1 Introduction One of the main reasons for the advent of Office Information Systems is related to the lack of equipment and tools in offices. It is often pointed out that an average office worker has an inferior set of capital equipment at his disposal to that of an industrial worker.

5000|$|SMTP is a {{delivery}} protocol only. In normal use, mail is [...] "pushed" [...] to a destination mail server (or next-hop mail server) as it arrives. Mail is routed {{based on the}} destination server, not the individual user(s) {{to which it is}} addressed. Other protocols, such as the Post Office Protocol (POP) and the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) are specifically designed for use by individual users retrieving messages and managing mail boxes. To permit an intermittently-connected mail server to pull messages from a remote server on demand, SMTP has a feature to initiate <b>mail</b> queue <b>processing</b> on a remote server (see Remote Message Queue Starting below). POP and IMAP are unsuitable protocols for relaying mail by intermittently-connected machines; they are designed to operate after final delivery, when information critical to the correct operation of mail relay (the [...] "mail envelope") has been removed.|$|R
