[...] One case which came before him {{involved}} a physician whose license had been revoked by the State Board of Medical Examiners for performing an abortion. [...] Judge Crothers refused to overturn the board's revocation on technical grounds, and his decision was upheld on appeal. [...] Even after Crothers' retirement from the bench and his return to private law practice, he was {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "Judge" [...] throughout the rest of his life. [...] In a 1956 letter, former U.S. president (and Stanford classmate) Herbert Hoover wrote, [...] "Judge George E. Crothers was <b>my</b> <b>good</b> <b>friend</b> in bad times and in good times for over sixty years".|$|E
500|$|The Heroes of the Lance are {{the protagonists}} of the Chronicles trilogy, the first series of Dragonlance books. They {{were created by}} Weis and Hickman, then fleshed out as player {{characters}} in gaming sessions of Dungeons & Dragons at Hickman's apartment. One player at this initial gaming session was game designer Terry Phillips, who was playing as Raistlin. According to Hickman in the foreword to The Soulforge, [...] " [...] were just settling in to the game when I turned to <b>my</b> <b>good</b> <b>friend</b> Terry Phillips and asked what his character was doing. Terry spoke...and the world of Krynn was forever changed. His rasping voice, his sarcasm and bitterness all masking an arrogance and power that never needed to be stated suddenly were real. Everyone {{in the room was}} both transfixed and terrified. To this day Margaret [...] swears that Terry wore the black robes to the party that night." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{couple had}} ten illegitimate children—five sons and five daughters—nine {{of whom were}} named after William's siblings; each was given the surname [...] "FitzClarence". Their affair lasted for twenty years before ending in 1811. Mrs. Jordan had no doubt as to {{the reason for the}} break-up: [...] "Money, money, <b>my</b> <b>good</b> <b>friend,</b> has, I am {{convinced}} made HIM at this moment the most wretched of men," [...] adding, [...] "With all his excellent qualities, his domestic virtues, his love for his lovely children, what must he not at this moment suffer?" [...] She was given a financial settlement of £4,400 (equivalent to £ today) per year and custody of her daughters on condition that she did not resume the stage. When she resumed acting in an effort to repay debts incurred by the husband of one of her daughters from a previous relationship, William took custody of the daughters and stopped paying the £1,500 (equivalent to £ today) designated for their maintenance. After Mrs. Jordan's acting career began to fail, she fled to France to escape her creditors, and died, impoverished, near Paris in 1816.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal's first fixture of November {{was at home}} to Charlton Athletic. The team conceded four {{goals in}} 20 minutes and blew several chances to [...] "kill the game", in what was the club's biggest home defeat in the league under Wenger. An away trip to local rivals Tottenham Hostpur became {{magnified}} with interest, given it marked the return of Campbell following his move to Arsenal. An 81st-minute goal scored by Pirès put Arsenal into the lead, before a lapse by Wright in goal allowed Gus Poyet‘s shot to squirm from his grasp and enter the goalnet. Arsenal then faced league champions Manchester United {{and in spite of}} conceding inside 14 minutes through a Paul Scholes’ strike, Ljungberg equalised for them [...] "with a wonderful chipped finish, following Gary Neville's wretched error." [...] Arsenal improved in the second half but scored in unforeseen fashion: United goalkeeper Fabien Barthez passed the ball directly into the feet of Henry, who profited from the error and scored. Five minutes later, Barthez's failure to grasp the ball presented Henry the chance to score his second, which he did. Both Henry and Wenger defended the opposition goalkeeper, with the former, his international teammate saying: [...] "Of course I was happy to score the goals but it was strange. He's <b>my</b> <b>good</b> <b>friend</b> and I feel sorry for him; I would rather have got them another way." ...|$|E

Taylor began filming her scenes in October and made her on-screen return in the episode broadcast on 25 December. Toyah has often been mentioned and referred to by her family members since her departure. Taylor expressed her happiness at her return, saying [...] "I am thrilled to be re-joining my old friends on the cobbles and hugely excited {{to be given the}} opportunity to explore the character of Toyah 13 years on. Coronation Street has always had a place in my heart and I'm delighted to be working again with <b>my</b> <b>good</b> <b>friend</b> Jane Danson and bringing the Battersby sisters back together." [...] The actress also said that the upcoming storylines played a part in her return to the show. She described them as [...] "fantastic, clever, and detailed". The show's series producer, Kate Oates, added that Toyah would have some secrets upon her return that she has kept from her sister, Leanne. The character's return storyline saw her showing up in Weatherfield after deciding to end her marriage to husband Toby (Andrew Dowbiggin), because she has been having an affair. Toby later follows Toyah to the Street, where he asks her to reconsider her decision and try for a baby. However, Toyah makes it clear that their marriage is finished and asks him to leave.|$|E

When the baby, whom Maud adored as the daughter she never had, died, she was devastated and needed to consume medicine. In a letter to her sister, Maud wrote, [...] "Dorothy was a beautiful baby. I could have taken her for my very own and loved her devotedly. To assuage her distress, Frank made his protagonist of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz a female named Dorothy.
