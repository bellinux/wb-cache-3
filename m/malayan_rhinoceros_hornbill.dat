50|$|The <b>rhinoceros</b> <b>hornbill</b> is {{the state}} bird of the Malaysian state of Sarawak and the country's National Bird. Some Dayak people, {{especially}} the Ibanic groups, {{believe it to be}} the chief of worldly birds or the supreme worldly bird, and its statue is used to welcome the god of the augural birds, Sengalang Burong, to the feasts and celebrations of humankind. Contrary to some misunderstandings, the <b>rhinoceros</b> <b>hornbill</b> does not represent their war god, Sengalang Burong, who is represented in this world by the brahminy kite.|$|R

25|$|Bird World, {{opened in}} 1975, {{features}} open aviaries in which guests can mingle with exotic birds such as Egyptian plovers, <b>rhinoceros</b> <b>hornbills,</b> and crested oropendolas and even two-toed sloths. Each area features naturalistic habitats and replicated tropic and aquatic ecosystems, with three major exhibits built without barriers so the birds can fly freely among zoo visitors. At the Bird World kitchen viewing window, visitors can see firsthand what the birds eat. There are four outdoor exhibits directly {{attached to the}} exterior of Bird World which are home to African penguins, Steller's sea eagles, kea and double-wattled cassowaries.|$|R

5000|$|Since 1992, Gregory Colbert has {{launched}} more than 60 expeditions to locations including India, Burma, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Dominica, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tonga, Namibia, and Antarctica to film and photograph interactions between {{human beings and}} animals.

5|$|The zoo {{provides}} sanctuary to {{many animals}} that {{need a place}} to live for various reasons. Some (like the Arabian oryx, Bali mynah, <b>rhinoceros</b> <b>hornbill,</b> Mexican gray wolf, and white rhinoceros) participate in captive breeding programs, some (such as the African spotted dogs) have retired from such programs and need a home, some have behavioral problems, and some are being rehabilitated to return to the wild. Animals that are in sanctuary are treated somewhat differently from other animals by the zoo. While normal exhibits balance the needs of the animals with those of visitors (for example, incorporating large viewing areas), the sanctuary exhibits are almost completely focused on the comfort and well-being of the animals.|$|R
5000|$|Peat swamp forests {{occupy the}} entire {{coastline}} of Borneo. The {{soil of the}} peat swamp are comparatively infertile, while it {{is known to be}} the home of various bird species such as the hook-billed bulbul, helmeted <b>hornbill</b> and <b>rhinoceros</b> <b>hornbill.</b> There are about 15,000 species of flowering plants with 3,000 species of trees (267 species are dipterocarps), 221 species of terrestrial mammals and 420 species of resident birds in Borneo. There are about 440 freshwater fish species in Borneo (about the same as Sumatra and Java combined). In 2010, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) stated that 123 species have been discovered in Borneo since the [...] "Heart of Borneo" [...] agreement was signed in 2007.|$|R
50|$|The {{variety of}} plant life is also habitat {{for a great}} variety of birds and mammals. There are some 326 species of birds in Kinabalu Park, {{including}} the spectacular <b>rhinoceros</b> <b>hornbill,</b> mountain serpent-eagle, Dulit frogmouth, eyebrowed jungle flycatcher, and bare-headed laughingthrush. Twenty-four birds are mainly found on the mountain. The mountain is home to some 100 mammalian species mostly living high in the trees, including one of the four great apes, the orangutan (though sightings of these are uncommon; estimates of its numbers in the park range from 25 to 120). Other mammals include three kinds of deer, the Malayan weasel (Mustela nudipes), oriental small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinerea), and leopard cat (Felis bengalensis). Endemic mammals include the black shrew (Suncus ater) and Bornean ferret-badger (Melogale everetti).|$|R

40|$|Hornbill has an {{important}} role in forest regeneration, but the limited variety andamount of food available to birds will eventually threaten the population of hornbills. Identification of feed plant and hornbil species diversity was conducted at the HarapanRainforest from March to April 2011. Hornbills plant feed samples were taken right after thebirds were eating. The results showed there are nine plant species of hornbills feed found in theHarapan Rainforest: Santiria apiculata, Elaeocarpus sphaericus, Sapium baccatum, Lithocarpusreinwardtii, Disoxylum excelsum, Ficus curtipes, Knema globularia, Knema furfuracea, andSantiria oblongifolia. Of these nine species, Ficus curtipes is the most preferred feed by thehornbills. Further research also notes that there are seven hornbill species inhabit the HarapanRainforest: crested <b>hornbills</b> (Aceros comatus), <b>rhinoceros</b> <b>hornbills</b> (Buceros <b>rhinoceros),</b> goldhornbill (Aceros undulatus), black kangkareng (Anthracaceros malayanus), black-crestedhornbill (Aceros corrugatus), khilingan hornbills (Anorrhinus galeritus) and ivory hornbill(Rhinoplax vigil...|$|R
5000|$|For {{the next}} ten years, Colbert did not {{publicly}} exhibit his art or show any films. Instead, he traveled to such places as Antarctica, India, Egypt, Burma, Tonga, Australia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Namibia, Kenya, Tanzania, Thailand, China, the Arctic, the Azores, and Borneo. Elephants, whales, manatees, sacred ibis, cranes, eagles, gyrfalcons, <b>rhinoceros</b> <b>hornbills,</b> cheetahs, leopards, African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), caracals, baboons, eland, meerkats, gibbons, orangutans, penguins, pandas, polar bears, lions, giant Pacific manta rays, and saltwater crocodiles are among the animals he has filmed and photographed. Human collaborators include San bushmen, Tsaatan, Lisu, Massai, Chong, Kazakhs, and people from other indigenous tribes around the world. Colbert, who calls animals [...] "nature's living masterpieces," [...] photographs and films both wild animals and {{those that have been}} habituated to human contact in their native environments. The images record what he saw through the lens of his camera without the use of digital collaging.|$|R
50|$|One of the zoos oldest sections, the Asian Domain, was renovated and {{renamed the}} Asian Gardens in 2007. Exhibits there include Indian <b>rhinoceros,</b> <b>Malayan</b> tigers, babirusa, Komodo dragon, clouded leopards, sloth bears, and an Indonesian-themed aviary. The pagoda-like design is subtle but noticeable, giving an {{authentic}} Asian feel.|$|R
