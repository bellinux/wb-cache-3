5|$|Back from Italy {{and in the}} New York State Senate, {{he fought}} hard for the {{regulation}} of informal immigrant banks and banking agents that handled <b>money</b> <b>transfers</b> abroad, an issue of significant importance to his Italian constituency who were often swindled from their remittances to their families in Italy. Cotillo’s 1921 banking reform bill, which placed express companies and steamship agencies that transferred money abroad {{under the supervision of}} the New York State Banking Department, annoyed powerful interests of such companies as Wells Fargo and the Cunard Lines. He received death threats and offers of bribes to drop the legislation he had introduced in the Senate. During the hearings on Cotillo’s bill in March 1921, a devastating crash of the Tisbo Brothers immigrant bank in lower Manhattan left 2,000 angry depositors with losses of more than three million dollars. As a result, four bills that regulated the sector were signed into law on May 1, 1921.|$|E
5|$|The {{club has}} also {{time and again}} shown to have {{a soft spot for}} clubs in {{financial}} disarray. Repeatedly the club has supported its local rival 1860 Munich with gratuitous friendlies, transfers at favourable rates, and direct <b>money</b> <b>transfers.</b> Also when St. Pauli threatened to lose its license for professional football due to financial problems, Bayern met the club for a friendly game free of any charge, giving all revenues to St. Pauli. More recently when Mark van Bommel's home club Fortuna Sittard was in financial distress Bayern came to a charity game at the Dutch club. Another well known example was the transfer of Alexander Zickler in 1993 from Dynamo Dresden. When Bayern picked up Zickler for 2.3 Million DM many considered the sum to be a subvention for the financially threatened Dresdeners. In 2003, Bayern provided a 2 Million Euro loan without collateral to the nearly bankrupt Borussia Dortmund which has since been repaid. On 14 July 2013, Bayern played a charity game against financially threatened third division Hansa Rostock. The game raised about €1 million, securing Hansa's licence.|$|E

5|$|While details {{regarding}} Richard Cantillon's {{life are}} scarce, {{it is thought}} that he was born sometime during the 1680s in County Kerry, Ireland. He was son to land-owner Richard Cantillon of Ballyheigue. Sometime {{in the middle of the}} first decade of the 18th century Cantillon moved to France, where he attained French citizenship. By 1711, Cantillon found himself in the employment of British Paymaster General James Brydges, in Spain, where he organised payments to British prisoners of war during the War of Spanish Succession. Cantillon remained in Spain until 1714, cultivating a number of business and political connections, before returning to Paris. Cantillon then became involved in the banking industry working for a cousin, who at that time was lead-correspondent of the Parisian branch of a family bank. Two years later, thanks in large part to financial backing by James Brydges, Cantillon bought his cousin out and attained ownership of the bank. Given the financial and political connections Cantillon was able to attain both through his family and through James Brydges, Cantillon proved a fairly successful banker, specialising in <b>money</b> <b>transfers</b> between Paris and London.|$|E
