5|$|Bryan {{believed}} that he could, if nominated, unite the disaffected behind a strong silver campaign. However, part of his strategy was to remain inconspicuous until the last possible <b>moment</b> <b>at</b> the convention. He sent letters to national convention delegates, urging them to support silver, and enclosing copies of his photograph, writings, and speeches. Jones points out that though Bryan's speaking engagements were not deemed political {{by the standards of}} 1896, by modern measurements he was far more active in campaigning for the nomination than most of the better-known candidates.|$|E

5|$|At , Hughes faced future UFC Lightweight Champion Sean Sherk, winning via {{unanimous}} decision. Hughes {{started the}} action by taking Sherk down immediately, passing to half guard. Sherk {{was able to}} stand {{for a few seconds}} before Hughes took him down again. In round two, they started to trade punches, but eventually Hughes took Sherk down. Like the first round, they stood up for a <b>moment.</b> <b>At</b> the beginning of the third round, Sherk took Hughes down, while Hughes attempted a kimura from the bottom. A late stand up led to a second takedown by Sherk. Round 4 saw Hughes using his strength to control the challenger on the ground. Sherk took Hughes down again in the fifth round, but the champion controlled {{the rest of the time}} sprawl-and-brawling as he finished on top. With the victory, he became the first man to ever defeat Sherk.|$|E
5|$|Candaules {{shows the}} <b>moment</b> <b>at</b> which Gyges, {{hiding behind the}} door, first catches sight of Nyssia's naked body. Candaules lies naked in bed, while Nyssia undresses as she prepares to join him, and Gyges tiptoes around the door {{to catch a glimpse}} of her. Nyssia holds a piece of fabric, which forms a {{vertical}} line cutting off the body of Candaules at the top of his legs, invoking a theme of emasculation at the hands of a powerful woman. By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty intended that the viewer feel the same sense of voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges would have felt, forced to spy on his master's naked wife against his will and without her knowledge. The cluttered arrangement of drapery and architectural features intentionally exaggerates the claustrophobic and implicitly violent nature of the scene.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} session on Friday afternoon, Nico Rosberg was fastest, setting a time of 1:21.531. With the track tarmac still being very new, the surface was {{slippery}} and it was another session that {{saw a lot of}} drivers get caught out. The biggest accident of the practice came after just five minutes, when Max Verstappen crashed at the exit of the stadium, bringing out red flags. After the running resumed, Valtteri Bottas lost the rear of his Williams FW37, caused by a fault in his DRS flap, and crashed at turn one. He {{was not the only one}} having problems in the first corner, as Sergio Pérez, Carlos Sainz Jr. and Pastor Maldonado also went off there. Lewis Hamilton meanwhile had an off-track <b>moment</b> <b>at</b> turn four. Romain Grosjean had to end his first practice of the weekend early, when a clutch failure saw him park his car 28 minutes into the session. Jenson Button ran 25 laps and finished ninth fastest albeit spending half of the session in the pit lane, while the team equipped his car with a new power unit. Behind Rosberg, the two Red Bull drivers were second and third, ahead of Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel.|$|E

5|$|While {{the killing}} of Hálfdan by the Orkney islanders is {{recorded}} independently in the Historia Norvegiæ, the manner of his death is unspecified. The blood eagle sacrifice may be a misunderstanding or an invention of the sagawriters as it does not feature directly in the earlier skaldic verses, which instead indicate that Hálfdan {{was killed by a}} volley of spears. The verses do mention the eagle as a carrion bird, and this may have influenced the saga writers to introduce the blood eagle element. The sagas then relate that Harald sought vengeance for his son's ignoble death, and set out on campaign against Einarr, but was unable to dislodge him. Eventually, Harald agreed to end the fight in exchange for a fine of 60 gold marks levied on Einarr and the allodial owners of the islands. Einarr offered to pay the whole fine if the allodial landowners passed their lands to him, to which they agreed. Einarr's assumption of control over the islands appears well-attested and was considered by later commentators to be the <b>moment</b> <b>at</b> which the Earls of Orkney came to own the entire island group in fee to the King of Norway. Others have interpreted the payment of 60 gold marks as wergild or blood money.|$|E
25|$|When a joint is released, {{balancing}} moment {{occurs to}} counterbalance the unbalanced moment which is initially {{the same as}} the fixed-end moment. This balancing moment is then carried over to the member's other end. The ratio of the carried-over <b>moment</b> <b>at</b> the other end to the fixed-end moment of the initial end is the carryover factor.|$|E
25|$|The initial pattern {{constitutes}} {{the seed of}} the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed—births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete <b>moment</b> <b>at</b> which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.|$|E

His finest posteason occurred in 1997 for the Baltimore Orioles when in 4 games he went 2–0 with a 1.24 ERA in 29 IP with 11 H, 4 ER, 7 BB and 41 K. Notably, he twice outdueled Seattle Mariners ace Randy Johnson in head-to-head matchups during the ALDS.

25|$|The Oath of Allegiance was abolished, as were {{appeals to}} the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The opposition-controlled Senate, when it protested and slowed down these measures, was also abolished. In 1931, the British {{parliament}} had passed the Statute of Westminster, which established the legislative equal status of the self-governing Dominions of the then British Commonwealth, including the Irish Free State, {{to one another and}} the United Kingdom. Though a few constitutional links between the Dominions and the United Kingdom remained, this is often seen as the <b>moment</b> <b>at</b> which the Dominions became fully sovereign states.|$|E
25|$|The chief {{criticism}} of race, milieu, and <b>moment</b> <b>at</b> {{the time the}} idea was created was {{that it did not}} sufficiently take into account the individuality of the artist, central to the creative genius of Romanticism. Even Zola, who owed so much to Taine, made this objection, arguing that an artist's temperament could lead him to make unique artistic choices distinct from the environment that shaped his general viewpoint; Zola's principal example was the painter Édouard Manet. Similarly, Gustave Lanson argued that race, milieu, and moment could not among themselves account for genius; Taine, he felt, explained mediocrity better than he explained greatness.|$|E

25|$|At Rangers, Andersen {{would play}} {{alongside}} fellow Dane Brian Laudrup. During {{his time at}} Rangers, Andersen's technical shortcomings and awkward playing style earned him the nickname Bambi. Perhaps his most infamous <b>moment</b> <b>at</b> Rangers was when he shot the ball over the bar from four yards in a Premier League match against Dundee United. His best Rangers moment was when he came on as a substitute and scored twice in the 3–1 victory over arch-rivals Celtic at Ibrox Stadium. It was the goals to make it 2–1 and 3–1, which he delivered. Rangers won the Premier Division titles in both 1995/96 and 1996/97, {{but he could not}} establish himself in the Rangers starting line-up, and was eventually not allowed to train with the first team.|$|E
25|$|After marrying, Joseph and Jessie Wilson {{moved to}} the Southern United States in 1851 and came to fully {{identify}} with it, moving from Virginia deeper into the region as Wilson became a minister in Georgia and South Carolina. Joseph Wilson owned slaves, defended slavery, and also set up a Sunday school for his slaves. Both parents identified with the Confederacy during the American Civil War; they cared for wounded soldiers at their church, and Wilson's father briefly served as a chaplain to the Confederate Army. Woodrow Wilson's earliest memory, {{from the age of}} three, was of hearing that Abraham Lincoln had been elected and that a war was coming.

25|$|In {{the early}} morning of 22 May 2013, a girlfriend {{of one of the}} sons left the house. At 6:40AM, Mrs. Haroková called the grammar school where she worked, saying that she had a bad {{headache}} and would take the day off. The police believe that she and two other victims were killed between this time and 8:00AM, which was the <b>moment</b> <b>at</b> which Mrs Haroková's wristwatch stopped. A post woman arrived at the door shortly before nine. The doorbell was answered by Dahlgren, who accepted the mail. Two hours later, a cleaner came to the house, but was sent away by Dahlgren immediately after entering the hallway. Meanwhile, the fourth victim, David, who was at school, received text messages from Dahlgren's phone that they would go running after his return. David was probably murdered immediately after returning to the house around 12:30PM.|$|E
25|$|During the 1989/90 season Davis {{recorded}} {{wins over}} Jimmy Van Rensberg and Mike Watterson, but a 10–6 defeat by Ian Brumby {{in the second}} round of qualifying for the World Championship meant that he was forced into a 'play-off' to maintain his full professional status. Davis opted to play and was defeated 10–5 by Jason Prince. Suffering from arthritis of the knee, Davis literally limped from the arena to the press conference during which he was given an emotional standing ovation from spectators, players on other match tables and even those on the practice tables, who all ceased playing to acknowledge the <b>moment.</b> <b>At</b> the press conference, Davis announced he was now retired from competitive snooker but would keep playing in UK-based billiard tournaments. Ironically however, snooker threw its doors open to all comers and Davis resumed his snooker career, but played little competitive billiards thereafter.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} double murder, some parents warned their {{children}} about being out late. The second double murder shocked {{the city and}} curfews were set for businesses. The height of the town's hysteria snowballed after the murder of Virgil Starks. The Texarkana Gazette stated on Sunday, May 5, that the killer might strike again at any <b>moment,</b> <b>at</b> any place and at any one. Before, it was normal to leave your house unlocked, but soon residents started locking doors, pulling down shades, blocking windows, and arming themselves with guns. Some people would nail sheets over their windows or nail the window down. Some used screened-door braces as window guards. The next day after Starks' death, several residents bought firearms and locks. Stores sold out of locks, guns, ammunition, and window shades and Venetian blinds. Other items that sold well included window sash locks, screen door hooks, night latches, and other protective devices.|$|E
