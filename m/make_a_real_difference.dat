40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} effects of {{asymmetric}} information on the nature of financial equilibrium and on the capital structure of firms. In the first model presented, the financial contracts on offer involve pooling equilibrium with no adverse selection. However, in the special case analyzed, where contracts are of mixed form, there may be a separating equilibrium and also equilibrium may not exist. Interesting result is that the separating equilibrium found is not economically efficient since aggregate investments falls short of first-best level. More importantly, capital structure does matter. The relative magnitude of outside equity <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>difference</b> to the quantity of aggregate investment in equilibrium...|$|R

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to identify and describe what, if at all, UK policy says about spirituality in relation to the care of people with learning disabilities (LD). Design/methodology/approach – A systematic policy review using three government databases: legislation. gov. uk; Department of Health and Directgov (now known as gov. uk) was carried out. Findings – The review identified policy gaps and a general lack of government directives in relation to the spiritual care of people with LD. Whilst research in this area is gathering momentum, practical implementation which <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>difference</b> to the spiritual experiences of people with LD appears to be sparse.

40|$|Summary Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) is an X-linked disorder {{for which there}} is currently no curative treatment. The natural history is such that affected boys need to use a wheelchair at around 9 years, develop respiratory and cardiac complications and die at a mean age of 19 years. While treatments based on gene modification or replacement are eagerly awaited, advances in medical management of DMD have made a significant difference to the natural history of the condition such that most affected individuals can now be expected to live into adulthood. The key interventions relate to the use of corticosteroids to improve muscle strength and function, surgical management of scoliosis and surveillance for and timely manage-ment of respiratory and cardiac complications. The predictable nature of the complications of DMD lends itself to the implementation of a planned programme of surveillance and management, which <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>difference</b> to survival and quality of life. & 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Tinnitus, {{is one of}} {{the leading}} symptom in {{neurological}} disorders, particularly relating with diseases of the middle ear, blood vessels or the after effect as a result of exposure to certain medications. The preliminary diagnosis of tinnitus is established by subjecting the patient to common tinnitus simulated sounds. This helps to assess the patient's perception of tinnitus on a score that helps in planning further treatments involved with medications or advanced interventions. The major drawback within this widely accepted preliminary diagnosis technique is that of the subjugation of noise interference. Power line noise interferes with the simulated sounds, affecting what the patient perceives during the test. The values obtained can be less accurate, challenging precise diagnosis and other medications/interventions. Hence to overcome this error, noise interference has to be cut off by making use of the original simulated sound. The present paper deals with instrumental noise and its separation by utilizing Dhoulath's method. By incorporating this technique, the regular error prone test can be made precise and perfect in the diagnosis of tinnitus that <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>difference</b> at the applied level...|$|R
