50|$|The Ordnance QF 18 pounder, {{or simply}} 18-pounder Gun, was the {{standard}} British Empire field gun of the First World War-era. It formed {{the backbone of}} the Royal Field Artillery during the war, and was produced in large numbers. It was used by British Forces in all the main theatres, and by British troops in Russia in 1919. Its calibre (84 mm) and shell weight were greater than those of the equivalent field guns in French (75 mm) and German (77 <b>mm)</b> <b>service.</b> It was generally horse drawn until mechanisation in the 1930s.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the AR-15/M16, the AR-18 {{did not see}} {{substantial}} sales success, and {{was never}} officially adopted by any country as their standard service rifle. The reasons for this are unclear, but may {{have had something to}} do with the existing sales popularity of the AR-15/M16, as well as the need for additional field testing and evaluation of the Costa Mesa-produced rifles, which were still in the advanced prototype stage. The AR-18 was purchased for evaluation trials by various armed forces, including the United States (1964) and the United Kingdom (1966). [...] These suffered various malfunctions during evaluation trials by various nations. [...] During the US trials at Aberdeen Proving Ground in 1964, the AR-18's functioning was found to vary from lot to lot of ammunition. [...] The evaluating board concluded that while the basic design of the AR-18 was sound, it required additional minor revisions and changes to improve safety and reliability before it could be considered for adoption as a service rifle. [...] The British Ministry of Defence (MOD) tested the AR-18 in March 1966, and found the design unsatisfactory in performance during mud and sand trials. ArmaLite made several minor production modifications to the design commencing in 1965, and the U.S. Army was directed to re-evaluate the AR-18 at the end of 1969. Testing was conducted at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, conducted by arsenal employees and the Infantry Board at Fort Benning, Georgia [...] However, American procurement officials were not interested in acquiring yet another 5.56 <b>mm</b> <b>service</b> rifle. A number of deficiencies were listed and the testing authority stated that, although the AR-18 had military potential, it needed further development. In 1968, dissatisfied with efforts to market the AR-18, Arthur Miller left ArmaLite.|$|E
40|$|Mobile money (<b>MM)</b> <b>services</b> can {{contribute}} to welfare gains in smallholder farm households. Previous research showed that one important pathway is through higher remittances received from relatives and friends. Here, the role of other impact pathways is examined, especially focusing on agricultural marketing and off-farm economic activities. The analysis builds on panel data from smallholder coffee farmers in Uganda. Regression models show that the adoption of MM technology has contributed to higher household incomes and consumption levels. Off-farm income gains are identified {{to be an important}} pathway, also beyond remittances. Typical off-farm income sources are small businesses in trade, transport, and handicrafts, which benefit from novel savings and money transfer opportunities through MM. In terms of agricultural marketing, MM users sell a larger proportion of their coffee as shelled beans to buyers in high-value markets, instead of selling to local traders immediately after harvest. <b>MM</b> <b>services</b> help reduce cash constraints and facilitate transactions with buyers from outside local regions. In conclusion, MM {{can contribute}} to rural development through various important pathways. Analysis of adoption patterns suggests that <b>MM</b> <b>services</b> are socially inclusive...|$|R

While government and professional organisations are supportive of greater community pharmacy involvement, {{there has been little}} research on the extent of current provision or of the views of community pharmacists in this area. To describe the characteristics and extent of HDS and <b>MM</b> <b>services</b> provided in New Zealand community pharmacies, and to document pharmacists’ opinions and perceived barriers in regard to the provision of these services. A four-part questionnaire was developed to record: the types of HDS /MM services offered by community pharmacies; the opinions of respondent pharmacists regarding these services; the characteristics of community pharmacies offering the services; and the profiles of the respondent pharmacists. The questionnaire was distributed to 879 community pharmacies in New Zealand. There were 458 valid questionnaires returned, with a response rate of 52 %. Over half (59 %) of the responding pharmacies reported provision of HDS and /or <b>MM</b> <b>services,</b> although there were relatively few ‘high level’ services such as cardiovascular risk assessment and disease management. Most services were paid for by pharmacy customers, although some District Health Boards paid for services such as Medicines Use Review.

40|$|Although {{specific}} phobias {{are among}} the most prevalent and most treatable of the anxiety disorders, successful treatments for firearm phobias are seldom reported. The assessment and treatment of a phobia specific to firing the 9 <b>mm</b> <b>service</b> pistol is described. The case was identified during a Return to Australia Psychological Screening (RTAPS) evolution, following the operational deployment of a Royal Australian Navy warship. The screening package involved group based psychoeducation and standardised self report scales for detecting trauma experiences and sources of psychological distress. These were followed by semi-structured individual interviews. This process revealed a sailor with a phobia linked to a traumatic experience following an unauthorised discharge of a 9 mm pistol. A behavioural treatment regime was planned and conducted at sea under operational conditions. Live firing constituted the main intervention. The positive results suggest live firing is a safe and effective form of single session exposure, conditional on additional safety precautions to supplement regulated weapons handling procedures.

40|$|Abstract. The {{increasing}} {{availability of}} multimedia (<b>MM)</b> resources, Web <b>services</b> {{as well as}} content, on the Web raises the need to automatically discover and process resources out of distributed repositories. However, the heterogeneity of applied metadata schemas and vocabularies – ranging from XML-based schemas such as MPEG- 7 to formal knowledge representation approaches – raises interoperability problems. To enable MM metadata interoperability by means of automated similarity-computation, we propose a hybrid representation approach which combines symbolic MM metadata representations with a grounding in so-called Conceptual Spaces (CS). In that, we enable automatic computation of similarities across distinct metadata vocabularies and schemas in terms of spatial distances in shared CS. Moreover, such a vector-based approach is particularly well suited to represent MM metadata, given {{that a majority of}} MM parameters is provided in terms of quantified metrics. To prove the feasibility of our approach, we provide a prototypical implementation facilitating similarity-based discovery of publicly available <b>MM</b> <b>services,</b> aiming at federated MM content retrieval out of heterogeneous repositories...|$|R
