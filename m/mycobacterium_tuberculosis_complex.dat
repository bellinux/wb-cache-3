This analysis of mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units also dated the Mycobacterium bovis lineage as dispersing approximately 6,000 years ago, which may be linked to animal domestication and early farming.|$|E

40|$|Background: Failure {{to early}} detect multidrug-resistant {{tuberculosis}} (MDR-TB) results in treatment failure and poor clinical outcomes, and highlights {{the need to}} rapidly detect resistance to rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) Methods: In Multi-Fluorescence quantitative Real-Time PCR (MF-qRT-PCR) assay, 10 probes labeled with 4 kinds of fluorophores were designed to detect the mutations in regions of rpoB, katG, mabA-inhA, oxyR-ahpC and rrs. The efficiency of MF-qRT-PCR assay was tested using 261 bacterial isolates and 33 clinical sputum specimens. Among these samples, 227 <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> isolates were analyzed using drug susceptibility testing (DST), DNA sequencing and MF-qRT-PCR assay. Results: Compared with DST, MF-qRT-PCR sensitivity and specificity for RIF-resistance were 94. 6 % and 100 %, respectively. And the detection sensitivity and specificity for INH-resistance were 85. 9 % and 95. 3 %, respectively. Compared with DNA sequencing, the sensitivity and specificity of our assay were 97. 2 % and 100 % for RIF-resistance and 97. 9 % and 96. 4 % for INH-resistance. Compared with Phenotypic strain identification, MF-qRT-PCR can distinguish 227 <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>complexes</b> (MTC) from 34 Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) isolates with 100 % accuracy rate. Conclusions: MF-qRT-PCR assay was an efficient, accurate, reliable and easy-operated method for detection of RIF and INH-resistance, and distinction of MTC and NTM of clinical isolates...|$|R
40|$|Some {{haematological}} alterations due {{to active}} cases of <b>tuberculosis</b> caused by <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> were investigated in Enugu Urban of South East, Nigeria. The results revealed thrombocythaemia, leucocytosis and elevated Erythrocyte sedimentation rates (p and lt; 0. 05). There was oligocythaemia, {{as well as}} reduced haematocrit and haemoglobin concentrations (p and lt; 0. 05). The significant oligocythaemia, anaemia, reduced packed cell volume found in active TB positive persons are all attributed to invasion of haematopoietic organs {{by any of the}} <b>Mycobacteria</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>complex</b> (MTBC) namely: M tuberculosis, M. bovis, M africanum, M. canetti, M. microti, and M. leprae, which reduced substantially the rate of erythropoiesis. The invasion of lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes, thymus and tonsils by MTBC stimulated the synthesis of leucocytes leading to leucocytosis (p and lt; 0. 05). This could be an inflammatory response which prepared the victim to defend itself against any of the MTBC that invaded the lungs and might even invade other extrapulmonary organs. Thrombocythaemia in active TB is attributed to haemoptysis, since the latter occurs whenever there is a wound or a threat to tissue injury or damage. When these changes in haematological parameters are used in combination with other tests, microscopic and clinical methods, TB diagnosis and treatment could be well improved...|$|R
