The film {{centers on}} a trio of {{homeless}} persons in Tokyo who discover a baby on Christmas Eve {{and set out to}} search for her parents. Tokyo Godfathers cost <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> than Kon's previous two films (with a budget of approximately 300,000,000 yen), and centered on the themes of homelessness and abandonment, with a comedic touch worked in. The screenplay was written by Keiko Nobumoto.|$|E

500|$|When Alexander {{destroyed}} Tyre, most of {{the towns}} on the route to Egypt quickly capitulated. However, Alexander met with resistance at Gaza. The stronghold was heavily fortified and built on a hill, requiring a siege. When [...] "his engineers pointed out to him {{that because of the}} height of the mound it would be impossible… this encouraged Alexander all the <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the attempt". After three unsuccessful assaults, the stronghold fell, but not before Alexander had received a serious shoulder wound. As in Tyre, men of military age were put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery.|$|E

500|$|Sholay was {{the first}} Indian film to have a {{stereophonic}} soundtrack {{and to use the}} 70mm widescreen format. However, since actual 70mm cameras were expensive at the time, the film was shot on traditional 35mm film and the 4:3 picture was subsequently converted to a 2.2:1 frame. Regarding the process, Sippy said, [...] "A 70mm [...] format takes the awe of the big screen and magnifies it even <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the picture even bigger, but since I also wanted a spread of sound we used six-track stereophonic sound and combined it with the big screen. It was definitely a differentiator." [...] The use of 70mm was emphasised by film posters on which the name of the film was stylised to match the CinemaScope logo. Film posters also sought to differentiate the film from those which had come before; one of them added the tagline: [...] "The greatest star cast ever assembled– the greatest story ever told".|$|E
500|$|The United States and the Soviet Union {{were both}} {{at the height of}} the Cold War during this time, and U.S. officials, {{including}} Supreme Court Justices, were highly aware of the harm that segregation and racism played on America's international image. When Justice William O. Douglas traveled to India in 1950, the first question he was asked was, [...] "Why does America tolerate the lynching of Negroes?" [...] Douglas later wrote that he had learned from his travels that [...] "the attitude of the United States toward its colored minorities is a powerful factor in our relations with India." [...] Chief Justice Earl Warren, nominated to the Supreme Court by President Eisenhower, echoed Douglas's concerns in a 1954 speech to the American Bar Association, proclaiming that [...] "Our American system like all others is on trial both at home and abroad, ... the extent to which we maintain the spirit of our constitution with its Bill of Rights, will in the long run do <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it both secure and the object of adulation than the number of hydrogen bombs we stockpile." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 4, 2007, Baird was {{appointed}} as Environment Minister in a cabinet shuffle, replacing Rona Ambrose. In making the appointment, Prime Minister Stephen Harper acknowledged that his government {{needed to do}} <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the environment a priority. Some commentators remarked favourably on Baird's appointment, describing him as a strong communicator and negotiator. Columnist Andrew Coyne, however, described Baird as [...] "the man sent to kill the issue," [...] suggesting that Baird's appointment was meant to neutralize the environment as an election issue rather than to initiate any meaningful reforms. Baird is a vocal opponent of the Kyoto Protocol, which he argues will bring about an [...] "economic collapse". Later in 2007, he added that any new environmental agreements must include reduction targets for major greenhouse emitters such as China, India and the United States who have not signed the Protocol or {{does not have any}} mandatory reductions set by the Protocol. Baird met with renowned Canadian environmentalist David Suzuki following his appointment. At the time Suzuki said he was encouraged by Baird's approach, but remained skeptical of the Harper government's environmental plans. However, when Baird unveiled the Conservative government's plan in April 2007, Suzuki confronted him, calling the plan [...] "a disappointment".|$|E

500|$|The World Ends with You was {{developed}} by the same team that created the Kingdom Hearts series, with input from Jupiter, the company that developed [...] The development of the game started {{two and a half years}} before its Japanese release, during the development of Kingdom Hearts II and the end of development of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories. At that time, Nintendo had announced the DS, but it was not yet on the market; Square Enix asked the team to make a game specifically for the handheld system. The creative team—consisting of Tatsuya Kando (director), Tomohiro Hasegawa (co-director), Takeshi Arakawa (planning director), and Tetsuya Nomura (character design)—were able to experience the DS during the [...] "Touch DS" [...] event in November 2004. From this demonstration, they had envisioned a version of Chain of Memories in which the card game aspects would be present on the bottom screen and an action role-playing game on the top. As they continued to work on the game, the developers realized that they wanted to use the touchscreen <b>more,</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> [...] "a game that can only be played on the DS". However, they also encountered the problem that by focusing heavily on the touchscreen, the top screen would be ignored. From this, the idea of the dual screen battle system arose. Several other options were explored for the top-screen game, including command-based battles or a music game, but once they reviewed the game from the eyes of the player, they ultimately settled on the card-game approach with the player having the option to control the game if they wanted to. Even with the completion of the Japanese version of the game, the team felt the dual screen system was too much for overseas audiences, and attempted to change the card-game mechanic into a special meter that would fill up with normal attacks from Neku, but this was not completed in time for release. However, the team was able to alter the [...] "information overload" [...] of the numerous tutorials at the start of the game in the North American release, reducing the amount of text presented as well as allowing the tutorials to be skipped. The [...] "Active Encounter" [...] system, the ability for the player to select when and how to go into battle, {{was developed}} specifically to avoid the issues of [...] "grinding" [...] that are common with most standard RPG systems. While they included the mechanics of being able to scan non-playable characters to see their thoughts, the team was not able to integrate this mechanic more into the game.|$|E

40|$|Informal patient {{payments}} are a widespread phenomenon in post-communist countries. In {{order to identify}} who is <b>more</b> likely <b>to</b> <b>make</b> informal payments in East-Central Europe, a 2013 survey is used. Reporting data from Special Eurobarometer No. 397 (‘Corruption’), the finding is that patients in Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania are significantly <b>more</b> likely <b>to</b> <b>make</b> extra informal payments or to give valuable gifts to medical practitioners or <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a hospital donation additional to the official fees. Women are <b>more</b> likely <b>to</b> <b>make</b> informal payments for healthcare services whilst unemployed patients or those never or almost never having difficulties in paying bills are less likely <b>to</b> <b>make</b> informal payments. The implications of the findings are then explored, displaying the population groups and spaces that need targeting when seeking to tackle informal patient payments...|$|R

CBS felt that Buck should have done <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> himself appear to be a set-up man for lead analyst Tim McCarver.
