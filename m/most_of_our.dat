5|$|According to Jains, the {{consequences}} of karma are inevitable. The consequences may {{take some time to}} take effect but the karma is never fruitless. The latent karma becomes active and bears fruit when the supportive conditions arise. A great part of attracted karma bears its consequences with minor fleeting effects, as generally <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> activities are influenced by mild negative emotions. However, those actions that are influenced by intense negative emotions cause an equally strong karmic attachment which usually does not bear fruit immediately. It takes on an inactive state and waits for the supportive conditions—like proper time, place, and environment—to arise for it to manifest and produce effects. If the supportive conditions do not arise, the respective karmas will manifest at the end of maximum period for which it can remain bound to the soul. These supportive conditions for activation of latent karmas are determined by the nature of karmas, intensity of emotional engagement at the time of binding karmas and our actual relation to time, place, surroundings. There are certain laws of precedence among the karmas, according to which the fruition of some of the karmas may be deferred but not absolutely barred.|$|E

Jarre {{was turned down}} by several record companies, until another of Schaeffer's students, Hélène Dreyfus, persuaded her husband to publish the album on his label, Disques Motors. The first pressing of 50,000copies was promoted through hi-fi shops, clubs and discos, and by April 1977 the album had sold 70,000copies in France. When interviewed in Billboard magazine, Dreyfus's director Stanislas Witold said [...] "In a sense we're putting <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> bets on Jean-Michel Jarre. He is quite exceptional and we're sure that by 1980 he will be recognised worldwide." [...] Oxygène has since sold an estimated 12million copies, the best-selling French record of all time. It reached number2 in the UK, number65 in Canada, and broke the top100 in the US. It also contains his most recognisable single, [...] "Oxygène IV", which reached number4 in the UK single charts.|$|E
