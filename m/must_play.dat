5|$|Zugzwang, disadvantageous {{since it}} forces {{a player to}} move, is often a factor in endgames but rarely in other stages of the game.

5|$|With 4...Bb4+ 5.Nbd2 d6 (see diagram at right) Black {{wants to}} open the {{diagonal}} a1–h8 for his queen. After 6.exd6 Qf6 White can react to the attack on his Bf4 in several ways, the best one being 7.Nh3 to develop a piece and protect both the Bf4 and the f2-pawn. It also helps that the Bf4 is still guarding the Nd2, so that after 7...Qxb2? {{there is not the}} threat of winning the exchange (8...Bxd2+ would be answered by 9.Bxd2) and White can repel Black's attack with 8.Rb1 Qa3 9.Rb3 Qa5 10.dxc7 Nc6 11.a3! Be7 12.e3. Instead, Black <b>must</b> <b>play</b> energetically with 7...Nxf2 8.Kxf2 Bxh3 9.g3 Bxf1 10.dxc7!? Nc6 11.Rxf1 and here Lalic recommends 11...0-0 12.Kg2 Rfe8.|$|E
