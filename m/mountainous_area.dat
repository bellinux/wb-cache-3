5|$|According to a {{study by}} Dr. Nguyen Viet Nhan, {{children}} in the areas where Agent Orange was used have been affected and have multiple health problems, including cleft palate, mental disabilities, hernias, and extra fingers and toes. In the 1970s, high levels of dioxin were found in the breast milk of South Vietnamese women, and in the blood of U.S. military personnel who had served in Vietnam. The most affected zones are the <b>mountainous</b> <b>area</b> along Truong Son (Long Mountains) and the border between Vietnam and Cambodia. The affected residents are living in substandard conditions with many genetic diseases.|$|E
5|$|Most {{members of}} the Eskaya {{community}} inhabit a <b>mountainous</b> <b>area</b> that intersects the municipalities of Duero, Guindulman, Pilar, and Sierra Bullones in the once-forested region of Bohol's southeast interior. The original Eskaya settlement in Biabas (Guindulman), was established in 1902. In 1951, the second township of Taytay (municipality of Duero) was founded by Fabian Baja in accordance with Datahan's directions. Significant Eskaya populations are now {{also found in the}} nearby townships of Canta-ub, Lundag, Tambongan, Cadapdapan, and Fatimah. In 1996, the Eskaya community was awarded a certificate of Ancestral Domain Claim by President Fidel Ramos.|$|E

30|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that the biggest problem in geoid determination is also encountered in the <b>mountainous</b> <b>areas.</b> This brings to question the use of Helmert orthometric heights in validating gravimetric geoid models in general and specifically in <b>mountainous</b> <b>areas,</b> in view of the increasing accuracy in geoid modelling. It may be interesting to find out the contribution of the differences between rigorous and Helmert’s orthometric heights on downward continuation of gravity anomalies onto the geoid, especially in <b>mountainous</b> <b>areas,</b> where there are significant differences.|$|R

5|$|The 40th Infantry Division {{shipped out}} to Korea in January 1952, and shortly thereafter, Bleak was {{promoted}} to Sergeant. His unit was assigned to a <b>mountainous</b> <b>area</b> near Minari-gol, South Korea, along the 38th Parallel. By that point in the war, the fronts had largely stabilized, and the duty in the area was characterized by constant, low-level trench warfare and continued battles over the same ground which produced high casualties. Bleak served as a field medic, assisting troops {{on the front lines}} instead of in Mobile Army Surgical Hospital units.|$|E

5|$|In Soegijapranata's apostolic vicariate were 84 pastors (73 European and 11 native), 137 {{brothers}} (103 European and 34 native), and 330 nuns (251 European and 79 native). The vicariate included Semarang, Yogyakarta, Surakarta, Kudus, Magelang, Salatiga, Pati, and Ambarawa; its geographic conditions {{ranged from}} the fertile lowlands of the Kedu Plain to the arid Gunung Sewu <b>mountainous</b> <b>area.</b> The vast majority of its population was ethnic Javanese, consisting of more than 15,000 native Catholics, {{as well as a}} similar number of European Catholics. The number of native Catholics quickly outpaced the number of European ones, and had doubled by 1942. There were also several Catholic groups, mostly working in education. However, the Indonesian Catholics were less prominent than the Protestants.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of Syria's {{population in the}} 12th century consisted of Sunni Muslims, typically from Arab or Kurdish backgrounds. There were also sizable Muslim communities of Twelver Shias, Druzes, and Alawites. The Ismaili presence was small and most were of Persian origin, having migrated from Alamut. They mostly resided in the <b>mountainous</b> <b>area</b> near the northern Syrian coastline. Large Christian communities existed in northern Syria, Palestine, Transjordan and Upper Mesopotamia. They were Aramaic-speaking and indigenous to the area, mostly belonging to the Syriac Orthodox Church. They lived in villages of Christian or mixed Christian and Muslim population, monasteries, and in small towns where {{they appear to have}} been on friendly terms with their Muslim neighbors. Ideologically, they were led by the Patriarch of Antioch.|$|E
5|$|From the 17th century, the Dutch {{established}} {{trade and}} political control on Sulawesi through the Dutch East Indies Company. Over two centuries, they ignored the <b>mountainous</b> <b>area</b> {{in the central}} Sulawesi, where Torajans lived, because access was difficult and it had little productive agricultural land. In the late 19th century, the Dutch became increasingly concerned about the spread of Islam {{in the south of}} Sulawesi, especially among the Makassarese and Bugis peoples. The Dutch saw the animist highlanders as potential Christians. In the 1920s, the Reformed Missionary Alliance of the Dutch Reformed Church began missionary work aided by the Dutch colonial government. In addition to introducing Christianity, the Dutch abolished slavery and imposed local taxes. A line was drawn around the Sa'dan area and called Tana Toraja ("the land of Toraja"). Tana Toraja was first a subdivision of the Luwu kingdom that had claimed the area. In 1946, the Dutch granted Tana Toraja a regentschap, and it was recognised in 1957 as one of the regencies of Indonesia.|$|E
