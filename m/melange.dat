5|$|At {{the mouth}} of the Rogue River, along the coast of Curry County, is the Otter Point Formation, a <b>mélange</b> of metamorphosed {{sedimentary}} rocks such as shales, sandstones, and chert. Although the rocks formed in the Jurassic, evidence suggests that they faulted north as part of the Gold Beach Terrane after the Klamaths merged with North America. Oregon's only dinosaur fragments, those of a hadrosaur or duck-billed dinosaur, were found here. In the mid-1960s, a geologist also discovered the beak and teeth of an ichthyosaur in the Otter Point Formation.|$|E
5|$|The film {{plays out}} with a {{recapitulation}} of a mock Kazakhstan national anthem glorifying the country's potassium resources and its prostitutes as being the second cleanest in the region. The visual <b>melange</b> of Soviet-era photos are mixed with the real flag of Kazakhstan and, incongruously, the final frames show the portrait of Ilham Aliyev, real-life president of Azerbaijan, a country {{that had not been}} otherwise mentioned in the film.|$|E
5|$|Elaine is the {{governor}} of the Tri-Island Area, a fictional group of pirate islands in the Caribbean. She is loved by the undead pirate LeChuck, who never ceases to pursue her affections and attempts to turn her into his undead bride, but Elaine instead falls in love with hapless protagonist Guybrush Threepwood. Elaine is consistently kidnapped by LeChuck, prompting Guybrush to attempt a rescue, although Elaine is usually more than capable of escaping predicaments by herself. She eventually marries Guybrush and relinquishes her gubernatorial responsibilities to her grandfather, travelling with Guybrush to the fictional Gulf of <b>Melange</b> to cure the outbreak of a voodoo-empowered pox.|$|E

5|$|The NCVP is {{underlain}} by {{four large}} crustal fragments, namely Stikinia, Yukon-Tanana, Cassiar and Cache Creek. Stikinia comprises volcanic, plutonic and sedimentary rocks that {{were created in}} an island arc environment during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. <b>Mélange</b> and abyssal peridotites, formed largely in an ancient oceanic basin, are the primary rocks of the Cache Creek Terrane. These are also Paleozoic to Mesozoic in age and are intersected by younger granitic intrusions. Yukon-Tanana and Cassiar consist of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks derived from the North American continent. The rocks of these two terranes are displaced and autochthonous in nature.|$|E
5|$|In Tales of Monkey Island, set {{several years}} after Escape from Monkey Island, Elaine has once again been kidnapped by LeChuck. In his rescue attempt, Guybrush {{inadvertently}} releases a voodoo pox over Gulf of <b>Melange,</b> which turns LeChuck into a human. While events separate Guybrush and Elaine, she befriends the now seemingly unmalicious LeChuck, and helps him return monkeys used for his voodoo spells to their homes. Elaine also attempts, without success, to arbitrate between merpeople with access to a cure for the pox and infected pirates. When negotiations break down, Elaine participates in a battle around the Jerkbait Islands to drive off the pirates. However, Elaine becomes infected with the pox and loses control, travelling to Flotsam Island to sack the town and kill Morgan LeFlay, a bounty hunter who she sees as a rival for Guybrush's love. Guybrush cures the pox, but LeChuck turns on him and fatally stabs him; Elaine cradles her husband as he dies. LeChuck takes Elaine captive and appears to convince her to join him as his demon bride; however, Elaine only submits to LeChuck to acquire a voodoo cutlass capable of destroying LeChuck. Guybrush returns as a ghost and maneuvers LeChuck into a position where Elaine can attack him with the cutlass. With LeChuck defeated, Guybrush restores himself to life by using a spell with Elaine's wedding ring, and returns to his wife.|$|E
5|$|The cuisine of Rwanda {{is based}} on local staple foods {{produced}} by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat {{more than a few}} times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as <b>mélange,</b> consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called urwagwa, made from sorghum or bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, Mützig, Amstel, and Turbo King. In 2009 a new brewery, Brasseries des Mille Collines (BMC) opened, manufacturing Skol beer and a local version known as Skol Gatanu; BMC is now owned by Belgian company Unibra. East African Breweries also operate in the country, importing Guinness, Tusker, and Bell, as well as whisky and spirits.|$|E

25|$|Later in the series, an {{artificial}} method of producing the spice is {{discovered by the}} Bene Tleilax, who develop in secret the technology to produce <b>melange</b> in axlotl tanks. Still, the technology is not fully successful in pushing natural <b>melange</b> out of the marketplace.|$|E
25|$|In Dune, {{the desert}} of Arrakis {{is the only}} known source of the spice <b>melange,</b> the most {{essential}} and valuable commodity in the universe. <b>Melange</b> is a geriatric drug that gives the user a longer life span, greater vitality, and heightened awareness; it can also unlock prescience in some subjects, depending upon the dosage and the consumer's physiology. This prescience-enhancing property makes interstellar travel ("folding space") possible. <b>Melange</b> comes with a steep price however: it is highly addictive, and withdrawal is a fatal process.|$|E
25|$|Reverend Mothers are {{dependent}} on <b>melange</b> to give them their abilities. Any person who consumes <b>melange</b> regularly becomes addicted to it and requires it for survival; however, one who has gone through the agony has a far greater need. Though the effects of <b>melange</b> are highly favorable, including vastly increased lifespan and mental powers, withdrawal results in death. <b>Melange</b> is expensive and thus is a continual drain on the Sisterhood's wealth; the most significant threat to the Bene Gesserit is the potential loss of their supply. Paul Atreides and then his son Leto II assert control over the Bene Gesserit and keep them in check by grasping control of the planet Arrakis and the spice supply {{in a show of}} hydraulic despotism.|$|E

25|$|In the far future, {{humanity}} has eschewed advanced {{computers in}} favor of adapting their minds {{to be capable of}} extremely complex tasks. Much of this is enabled by the spice <b>melange,</b> which is only found on the planet Arrakis, a desert planet with giant sandworms as its native lifeform. <b>Melange</b> improves general health, extends life and can bestow limited prescience, and its rarity makes it a form of currency in the interstellar empire. <b>Melange</b> allows the Spacing Guild's Navigators to safely route faster-than-light travel between planets, and helps the Reverend Mothers of the matriarchal Bene Gesserit to access their Other Memory, the ego and experiences of their female ancestors.|$|E

25|$|In Hunters of Dune, the 2006 Brian Herbert/Anderson {{sequel to}} Chapterhouse Dune, the Navigator Edrik fears his kind's {{obsolescence}} when the Spacing Guild itself (pressured by {{a shortage of}} <b>melange)</b> begins funding the development of superior Ixian navigation technology that would not require Navigators. Seeking an alternative source of spice to break the Bene Gesserit monopoly, he meets with Uxtal, {{the last of the}} Lost Tleilaxu, hoping that he can rediscover the method of producing <b>melange</b> in axlotl tanks (a secret believed lost when the Bene Tleilax were destroyed by the Honored Matres). However, Uxtal is in the forced service of the Matre Superior Hellica; her price for his expertise is Edrik's help transporting a certain cargo. He agrees, delivering by heighliner the Obliterators that destroy the planet Richese, where the Bene Gesserit are mass-producing weapons and armed battleships. Uxtal is ultimately unsuccessful, but the ghola he creates of deceased Tleilaxu Master Waff later offers Edrik something better in exchange for sanctuary — the genetic knowledge for the Guild to create their own, optimized sandworms to produce <b>melange.</b>|$|E
25|$|Edrik and the ultraspice are later {{intercepted by}} Face Dancer leader Khrone, who seizes the {{valuable}} optimized <b>melange.</b> He incapacitates Edrik by damaging his tank and releasing its spice gas, soon destroying the entire heighliner to rid {{himself of the}} Navigator altogether.|$|E

25|$|In , D'murr is {{piloting}} {{one of two}} heighliners which Hasimir Fenring uses to secretly {{test the}} synthetic <b>melange</b> created by the Tleilaxu in their Project Amal. The flawed spice disrupts and confuses D'murr's thoughts, feelings and prescience. He is compelled to send a telepathic message to his twin C'tair (who is hiding on Tleilaxu-conquered Ix) that his own heighliner carries rightful Ixian ruler Rhombur Vernius, {{on his way to}} free the planet. Disastrously, the first heighliner emerges from foldspace at the wrong point, striking the defensive shields of Wallach IX and plummeting into the atmosphere to its destruction. Affected by the tainted <b>melange,</b> D'murr misguides his ship out of the known universe and collapses. As his spice supply is replaced with real <b>melange,</b> D'murr senses with alarm that 'the enemy has seen us' (this is presumably the first reference to the Unknown Enemy that, millennia later, chases the Honored Matres back to the Old Empire in Heretics of Dune and threatens to destroy humanity). D'murr uses the last of his strength to return the ship safely to Junction, home of the Guild Headquarters, and dies.|$|E
25|$|In Heretics of Dune, it is {{revealed}} that the Tleilaxu have developed the ability to grow the spice <b>melange</b> in axlotl tanks, breaking the monopoly on spice that Arrakis held {{for thousands of years}} which strongly controlled the economics and the politics of the Imperium.|$|E
