5|$|From 78 to 76BC, the Romans led an {{expedition}} to an area north of the Danube, then the Iazyges' territory, because the Iazyges had allied with Mithridates VI of Pontus, with whom the Romans were at war. In 44BC King Burebista of Dacia died, and his kingdom began to collapse. After this, the Iazyges began to take possession of the Pannonian Basin, the land between the Danube and Tisa rivers (modern south-central Hungary). Historians have posited that this was done {{at the behest of}} the Romans, who sought to form a buffer state between their provinces and the Dacians. The Iazyges encountered the Basternae and Getae along their <b>migration</b> <b>path</b> sometime around 20AD, and turned southward, following the coast of the Black Sea until they settled in the Danube Delta. This move is attested by the large discrepancy in the position that Tacitus puts them, relative to where Ovid had earlier put them.|$|E

40|$|The {{temporal}} behaviour {{of solar}} active longitudes has been examined by using two sunspot catalogues, the Greenwich Photoheliographic Results (GPR) and the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD). The time-longitude diagrams {{of the activity}} distribution reveal the preferred longitudinal zones and their migration {{with respect to the}} Carrington frame. The <b>migration</b> <b>paths</b> outline a set of patterns in which the activity zone has alternating prograde/retrograde angular velocities with respect to the Carrington rotation rate. The time profiles of these variations can be described by a set of successive parabolae. Two similar <b>migration</b> <b>paths</b> have been selected from these datasets, one northern path during cycles 21 - 22 and one southern path during cycles 13 - 14, for closer examination and comparison of their dynamical behaviours. The rates of sunspot emergence exhibited in both <b>migration</b> <b>paths</b> similar periodicities, close to 1. 3 years. This behaviour may imply that the active longitude is connected to the bottom of convection zone...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to generate accurate, current data on distribution (distance to shore, travel path) and behavior (travel speed, migration timing) of gray whales migrating along the central Oregon coast (Pacific Ocean). <b>Migration</b> <b>paths</b> of tracked whales seem to follow a constant depth rather than following the shoreline. Speed estimates were within range of values reported by others. As expected, <b>migration</b> <b>paths</b> of some gray whales cross through areas of proposed wave energy development.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} how seismically derived gas chimneys {{can be used}} to determine hydrocarbon <b>migration</b> <b>paths.</b> The emphasis will be on how to interpret chimney cubes.

We will highlight distinguishing features of chimneys for oil-prone versus gas-prone prospects, and those related to separating active fault migration pathways. Further, we will show chimneys can support charging of shallow reservoirs. Our understanding of the petroleum system can improve by combining gas chimney data with other information. As such a chimney cube can be seen as a new exploration tool...|$|R
25|$|Besek Mountain, {{like much}} of the Metacomet Ridge, is {{composed}} of basalt, also called traprock, a volcanic rock. The mountain formed {{near the end of}} the Triassic Period with the rifting apart of the North American continent from Africa and Eurasia. Lava welled up from the rift and solidified into sheets of strata hundreds of feet thick. Subsequent faulting and earthquake activity tilted the strata, creating the cliffs and ridgeline of Besek Mountain. Hot, dry upper slopes, cool, moist ravines, and mineral-rich ledges of basalt talus produce a combination of microclimate ecosystems on the mountain that support plant and animal species uncommon in greater Connecticut. Besek Mountain is also an important raptor <b>migration</b> <b>path.</b> (See Metacomet Ridge for more information on the geology and ecosystem of Besek Mountain).|$|E

2500|$|At a later time, one {{of these}} miigis {{appeared}} in a vision to relate a prophecy.

Their <b>migration</b> <b>path</b> would be symbolized by a series of smaller Turtle Islands, which was confirmed with miigis shells (i.e., cowry shells). After receiving assurance from their [...] "Allied Brothers" [...] (i.e., Mi'kmaq) and [...] "Father" [...] (i.e., Abenaki) of their safety to move inland, the Anishinaabeg gradually migrated west along the Saint Lawrence River to the Ottawa River to Lake Nipissing, and then to the Great Lakes.|$|E
2500|$|The Metacomet Trail {{traverses}} {{the trap}} rock Metacomet Ridge which extends from Long Island Sound to the Massachusetts/ Vermont border. This ridge, rising {{hundreds of feet}} above the Connecticut River, Farmington River, and Quinnipiac River valleys, is a prominent landscape feature of central Connecticut. From south to north, the trail uses the ridges of the Hanging Hills, Short Mountain, Ragged Mountain, Bradley Mountain, Pinnacle Rock, Rattlesnake Mountain, Farmington Mountain, Talcott Mountain, Hatchet Hill, Peak Mountain, and West Suffield Mountain. Abrupt vertical cliffs with visible talus slopes and frequent viewpoints are common throughout. Views are generally to the west from West Suffield Mountain south through Ragged Mountain; with views in all directions at varying points in the Hanging Hills. The Farmington River cuts through the ridgeline between Hatchet Hill and Talcott Mountain in the Tariffville Gorge (east of Simsbury). Historic features along the trail include Old Newgate Prison museum and copper mine in East Granby; Heublein Tower on Talcott Mountain with [...] expansive view of four states; the Hill-Stead museum in Farmington, Connecticut, notable for its French impressionist painting collection and gardens; and Hubbard Park of the Hanging Hills of Meriden, designed {{with the help of}} famous landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted and crowned with a small observation tower known as Castle Craig. The trap rock ridges and talus slopes of the Metacomet Ridge are also home to several unique microclimate ecosystems that support species of plants that are unusual or endangered in this part of New England, and are a seasonal <b>migration</b> <b>path</b> for raptors. Viewshed from the ledges include agrarian land, suburbs, small towns, river corridors, the eastern Berkshires ridgeline, and metropolitan Meriden and Hartford.|$|E

40|$|Spatio-temporal {{patterns}} of insect population densities, for instance, spatial synchrony in population cycles, {{have been observed}} at different scales for several species and appear {{to be related to}} distinct phenomena of spatial and/or biological nature. In this study we investigated the hypothesis that migration processes determine the observable spatio-temporal synchrony in population dynamics of larch bud moth at the valley scale. We explored the effect of orography at a finer resolution on modelled potential dispersal ranges of larch bud moth by incorporating a high resolution GIS based migration model with a coarse resolution population dynamics simulation model. Modelled <b>migration</b> <b>paths</b> were affected considerably by inclusion of orography compared to predecessor models that ignored orographical effects. Our results demonstrate that geographical features such as orography are of importance for determining larch bud moth <b>migration</b> <b>paths</b> and resultant spatio-temporal populatio...|$|R
