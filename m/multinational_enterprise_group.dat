The analysis uses data from the Community Innovation Survey (CIS 3) for Austria. We employ a kernel-based matching approach as a non-parametric test. After controlling for size, sectoral affiliation, export intensity and other variables that influence innovative behaviour {{we find that the}} impact of foreign ownership on innovation input and outcome is not significant in most variables. Membership in a <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprise</b> <b>group,</b> however, significantly helps to overcome different obstacles in the innovation process, such as the lack of financial resources, the lack of technological and market information or organisational problems.

40|$|Despite {{the reality}} of the <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprise</b> <b>group,</b> many jurisdictions only deal with the single {{corporate}} entity. This is also the case in the context of cross-border insolvency. This article aims to provide guidance on how the European Union should respond to this problem. A logical first step would be to include specific provisions to deal with multinational enterprise groups in the European Insolvency Regulation. This article elaborates on the possibility of an 'adaptive framework', as the enormous variety of possibilities in the way these multinational enterprise groups are structured would then be appreciated. The second step in the process of regulating multinational enterprise groups in insolvency would be the standardization of insolvency laws on the treatment of multinational enterprise groups in insolvency, as a universalist approach, e. g. the centralization or coordination of the insolvency proceedings against enterprise groups, would be difficult to achieve without the legal means to consolidate the insolvency proceedings against multinational enterprise groups...|$|E
40|$|Identifying the ‘home country’ for the <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprise</b> <b>group’s</b> {{insolvency}} proceedings can be crucial for allowing an effective insolvency process for related entities. However, {{this is a}} challenging task given the diversity of group structures and insolvency scenarios. This article attempts {{to deal with this}} issue by applying alternatives of ‘insolvency venues’ to the group case and confronting them with key insolvency goals, to assess which standard venue could most effectively enhance cost efficiency, predictability and transparency of the rules (regarding jurisdiction), control forum shopping and accord with creditors’ legitimate expectations. The paper suggests that operational headquarters is in principle the most efficacious test for multinational groups, yet it also points out its limitations...|$|R

This central role of the BR was clearly {{stressed}} during the last meeting of Business Statistics Directors General (BSDG) held in October 2004, where {{about the future of}} the Business Register was stated that: “Many statistics related to globalisation have been or are currently being regulated by Community statistical law (statistics on foreign affiliates, balance of payments, and external trade). The information on <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprise</b> <b>groups</b> is either a prerequisite or a vital element for their compilation (they require the coverage of the whole economy as well). (…) This data is necessary to ensure the continuation of the comparability of many current statistics, where financial links between enterprises in different countries play an important role, e. g. productivity data. ” Council Regulation (EEC) N ° 696 / 93 on Statistical Units defines the <b>Enterprises</b> <b>Group</b> as “an association of enterprises bound together by legal and/or financial links (…).

40|$|International Merchandise Trade Statistics (IMTS) is {{a domain}} of {{official}} economic statistics with great tradition. The conventional data source of IMTS has been Customs documents, thus the basic recording principle the cross-border physical movement of goods. As long as national economies covered resident units only and units {{in different countries}} were unrelated to each other, border crossing provided a good estimation for the change of ownership between a resident and non-resident unit – the principle used in Balance of Payments and National Accounts. However, with the evolution of globalization, official ITGS statistics is facing challenges regarding its key conceptual and data collection aspects: Customs formalities are simplified and even abolished {{in the frame of}} a Customs union, non-resident units are acting as traders within the economy and a non negligible part of trade is done between related parties of <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprise</b> <b>groups.</b> Physical movements might become inflated and not reflecting the change of ownership due to internationally fragmented nature of global production processes.

40|$|This article follows another {{published}} in July 2013 which proposed an international tax database {{as a means}} to counter tax evasion. The purpose of proposing an international database is to recommend a suitable strategy for global information sharing. Such a mechanism will enable revenue authorities to access a bank of relevant evidence to assist in compliance evaluation. An example of this is transfer pricing: by accessing stored information from audits internationally, revenue authorities may be able to determine whether transactions occurring between <b>Multinational</b> <b>Enterprises</b> (MNE) <b>group</b> members are arm’s length or otherwise. In a broader compliance sense it would allow access to taxpayer information linked to various forms of profit shifting. The difference between the proposed database and other forms of exchange of information is that taxpayer information is routinely uploaded into an international repository. It is kept stored and available to group members at the onset of their risk reviews or audits so auditors are better able to quantify risk prior to initiating compliance actio...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') transfer pricing methods and its application to <b>Multinational</b> <b>Enterprise</b> ('MNE') <b>groups</b> in the financial sector. This study examines whether the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ('BEPS') Action Plan 9 is an appropriate framework for MNE groups in the banking sector or whether it creates further challenges. Additionally, the dissertation scrutinises MNE groups in the financial sector {{that are involved in}} the business of global trading of financial instruments. It further explores the functions of a global trading entity, the arm's length principle and the OECD BEPS Action Plan 9. This dissertation concludes that the global trading of financial instruments using the integrated trading model is challenged when the OECD traditional transfer pricing methods are applied. Multinational financial institution groups in the banking sector that are involved in the business of global trading of financial instruments are subject to rigid regulations. Furthermore, the report concludes that these rigid regulations mitigate some of the complications that arise when applying the OECD BEPS Action Plan 9. Taxing authorities need to focus greater attention on the global trading of financial instruments by multinational financial institutions groups. As South Africa's financial institutions expand across borders, the concerns over transfer pricing and BEPS are likely to intensify. It is therefore imperative that the South African revenue authorities prioritise the recruitment of skilled personnel in order to address the complexities posed by the global trading of financial instruments by multinational financial institution groups...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: With the {{business}} globalization of <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises,</b> management transplantation of multinational company to foreign subsidiary {{company has been}} a common phenomenon. Furthermore, <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises</b> management transplantation to their foreign subsidiary company has become the key for keeping sustaining competitive advantage gradually. The <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises</b> management transplantation to their foreign subsidiary company based on parent-subsidiary company relationship perspective is presented in this paper. The effect of multinational parent-subsidiary company relationship to management transplantation mainly depends on the culture integration, trust degree, property right structure, strategy intent to subsidiary company and so on. So the influence of culture integration, trust degree, strategy intent and property right structure to management transplantation is further discussed in this paper. Furthermore, <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises</b> management transplantation affected factors was not discussed sufficiently in the existed literature, so as a contribution of this paper, it will be supplemented. The suggestion of improving <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises</b> management transplantation effect will also be put forward...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} if conventional foreign direct investment theories explain why <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises</b> conduct foreign direct investment in Thailand. Theory testing based on multiple case studies will be the research method employed and qualitative secondary data {{will be used in}} an exploratory manner. Specifically, Dunning's eclectic paradigm will be tested against the foreign direct investment of three <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises</b> in Thailand, namely, Royal Dutch Shell, Toyota and Tesco. The study shows that conventional foreign direct investment theories are not powerful enough to explain all of the reasons <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises</b> conduct foreign direct investment in Thailand. Favorable exchange rates, weak market conditions, cultural similarities, geographic proximity, profitability, availability of partners, encouraging government incentives and the future potential of the region can play a substantial role when judging why <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises</b> conduct foreign direct investment in Thailand. This enhances our understanding of foreign direct investment theories and highlights their shortcomings when applied to Thailand. Therefore, governments and business analysts should not only rely on conventional foreign direct investment theories in order to explain the foreign direct investment of <b>multinational</b> <b>enterprises</b> in Thailand...|$|R
