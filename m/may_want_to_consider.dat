Depending on the music or style that the drumline plays, different brands and types of heads may be used. For maximum volume and stick articulation, a head made of woven Kevlar fibers is used and usually tuned to a very high tension. If the player desires a slightly [...] "softer" [...] feel, then an aramid fiber head (such as Remo's Black Max) is a good choice. Finally, if more overtones and the softest head-feel are desired, the player <b>may</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> a heavy clear head with a center reinforcement dot (such as a Remo Powerstroke 77). This type of head is rarely used today among competitive drumlines, mostly owing to its lack of outdoor projection in comparison with Kevlar, but nonetheless it may still be used if a unique timbre is desired. One {{of the most famous}} marching bands utilizing this head is the Ohio State University Marching Band. Though they play difficult cadences and drum features, they still use the sling drum and Remo Powerstroke 77 head to remain as traditional and formal as possible.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} two {{possible}} remedies for corporate governance research. First, when examining {{the effects of}} corporate governance, researchers <b>may</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> simultaneously <b>consider</b> the role of firm resources and capabilities.

We base our propositions on the notion that 2 ̆ 7 capability 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 motivation 2 ̆ 7 are the two fundamental drivers of firm competitive behaviour. Firm resources/capabilities, which correspond to the capability driver, define the potential level of a firm 2 ̆ 7 s competitive activity. Further, corporate governance, by virtue of affecting managers 2 ̆ 7 motivation to take actions, moderates the relationship between firm resources/capabilities and competitive behaviour. In addition, viewing from the capability-motivation lens, we also observe that some elements of the corporate governance system supplement firm-level resources and capabilities, thus having direct effects on firm competitive behaviour as well...|$|R
40|$|What is {{the goal}} of a {{business}} language class? Is it to prepare our students for the (global) business world or is it to teach business? Do we emphasize language or culture? These questions could be interpreted in many ways, leaving professors, students, and employers with vastly different ways of answering them. This article proposes looking at the needs of employers and the business world when organizing the course content of the business language class. Outside interests need not, and should not, dictate academic goals but they might inform the content and method of delivery. After all, a business language class is a “language for special purposes ” class, and as such lends itself particularly well to meeting a specifi c set of goals defi ned by outside agencies. If one goal of this course, and perhaps of the larger curriculum, is to prepare our students for the global world and an eventual job in their degree area, we <b>may</b> well <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> what the needs of employers are.

40|$|When {{working with}} vectors of time series which {{fluctuate}} regularly we <b>may</b> possibly <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> {{the presence of}} common factors characterized by cyclical or seasonal behavior as well as trend. For example, Deaton 89 provides {{a hint of a}} theoretical model where cointegration at the annual frequency may exist between consumption and income in addition to the usual secular cointegration. It is well known that a non-cyclical system cointegrated at frequency zero has a common trend (CT) representation Stock-Watson: 88. In this paper we show that a time series vector that is cointegrated at one or several frequencies simultaneously (e. g. seasonal data) has a common factors (CF) representation which belongs to a class of common factor models that encompasses many cointegrating situations found in the literature. We study these issues and extend the method proposed by Gonzalo-Granger: 95 to the estimation and testing of common factors which may combine trend as well as cyclical or seasonal characteristics. Two illustrative applications are also provided.

40|$|For {{almost two}} decades now, {{cities around the country}} have been {{demolishing}} traditional public housing and relocating residents to subsidized private market rental housing. In this paper, we examine sense of place, consisting of both community and place attachment, among a sample of Atlanta public housing residents prior to relocation (N[*]=[*] 290). We find that 41 % of the residents express place attachment, and a large percentage express some level of community attachment, though residents of senior public housing are far more attached than residents of family public housing. Positive neighborhood characteristics, such as collective efficacy and social support, are associated with community attachment, and social support is also associated with place attachment. Negative neighborhood characteristics, such as social disorder and fear of crime, are not consistently associated with sense of place. We argue that embodied in current public housing relocation initiatives is a real sense of loss among the residents.
