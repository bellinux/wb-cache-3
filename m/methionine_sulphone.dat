30|$|For {{the amino}} acids of raw materials, {{experimental}} diets and fish carcass, it used the technique previously described by Bosch et al. (2006). All {{the samples were}} analysed using a Waters HPLC system: this equipment consisted of two pumps, an autosampler, a fluorescence detector and a temperature control module (Model Waters 474, Waters, Mildford, MA, USA). Before hydrolysation, it was added aminobutyric, the internal standard patron. The samples were derivatized with AQC (6 -aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate). It was determined separately methionine as <b>methionine</b> <b>sulphone</b> and cysteine as cysteic acid after oxidation with performic acid. It was used a C- 18 reverse-phase column Waters Acc. Tag (150  mm × 3.9  mm) to separate the amino acids.|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{catalase}} from a peroxide resistant mutant of Proteus mirabilis binds NADPH tightly. Interestingly, this enzyme can {{be stripped}} of NADPH without {{loss of the}} catalatic activity. It is the only known non-mammalian catalase able to bind NADPH. The structure without cofactor was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of beef liver catalase as a model. The structure was refined to an R-factor of 19. 3 % in the range 8 to 2. 2 A resolution. According to the sequence, a <b>methionine</b> <b>sulphone</b> was positioned in the haem active site. This oxidized form of methionine is particular to Proteus mirabilis catalase and likely to produce some steric hindrance in the active site. Two important water molecules are positioned in the haem distal site. These two water molecules are not located {{in the structure of}} beef liver catalase, but are supposed to account for the catalytic mechanism. The liganded form was obtained by soaking crystals of the unliganded form into an NADPH solution. The structure was refined to an R-factor of 15. 9 % in the range of 8 to 3. 1 A resolution using the unliganded structure as a model. The NADPH was clearly located in the electron density map with the same conformation as in beef liver catalase. The NADPH binding induces slight structural changes. However, the imidazole ring of a histidine residue (His 284) rotates about 50 degrees to accommodate the cofactor. The electron transfer from NADPH to the haem molecule was examined and several pathways are proposed. A catalase from a peroxide resistant mutant of Proteus mirabilis binds NADPH tightly.

40|$|Amino acid {{methionine}} {{can suffer}} reversible oxidation to sulphoxide and further irreversible over-oxidation to <b>methionine</b> <b>sulphone.</b> As {{part of the}} cellular antioxidant scavenging activities are the methionine sulphoxide reductases (Msrs), with a reported role in methionine sulphoxide reduction, both free and in proteins. Three families of Msrs have been described, but the fission yeast genome only includes one representative for two of these families: MsrA/Mxr 1 and MsrB/Mxr 2. We have investigated their role in methionine reduction and H 2 O 2 sensitivity. We show here that MsrA/Mxr 1 is able to reduce free oxidized methionine. Cells lacking {{each one of the}} genes are not significantly sensitive to different types of oxidative stresses, neither display altered life span. However, only when deletion of msrA/mxr 1 is combined with deletion of met 6, which confers methionine auxotrophy, the survival upon H 2 O 2 stress decreases by 100 -fold. In fact, cells lacking only Met 6, and which therefore require addition of methionine to the growth media, are extremely sensitive to H 2 O 2 stress. These and other evidences suggest that oxidation of free methionine is a primary target of peroxide toxicity in cells devoid of methionine biosynthetic capacity, and that an important role of Msrs is to recycle this oxidized free amino acid.
