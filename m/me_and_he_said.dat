500|$|Following the two sellout concerts, all the {{participants}} attended a celebratory party in a basement club known as Ungano's. Dylan was so elated, Harrison recalled 16 years later, [...] "He picked me up and hugged <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'God! If only we'd done three shows!'" [...] Like Harrison, the experience of playing at Madison Square that day {{did not lead to}} Dylan immediately re-embracing the concert stage; only a brief guest appearance with the Band on New Year's Eve 1971–72 and sitting in during a John Prine club gig eventuated before he returned to touring in January 1974.|$|E
500|$|I saw the boy getting {{injured in}} his leg, {{and the father}} asking for help. Then I saw him getting injured in his arm, the father. The father was asking the {{ambulances}} to help him, because {{he could see the}} ambulances. I cannot see the ambulance... I wasn't far away, maybe from them [...] face to face about 15 meters, 17 meters. But the father didn't succeed to get the ambulance by waving to them. He looked at <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Help me." [...] I said, [...] "I cannot, I can't help you." [...] The shooting till then was really heavy... It was really raining bullets, for more than for 45minutes. Then... I hear something, [...] "boom!" [...] Really is coming with a lot of dust. I looked at the boy, I filmed the boy lying down in the father's lap, and the father really, getting really injured, and he was really dizzy. I said, [...] "Oh my god, the boy's got killed, the boy's got killed," [...] I was screaming, I was losing my mind. While I was filming, the boy got killed... I was very afraid, I was very upset, I was crying, and I was remembering my children.... This was the most terrible thing that has happened to me as a journalist.|$|E
2500|$|Weeks later, CNN's Randi Kaye told an {{audience}} at West Virginia University {{that she had}} been listening to Cooper's interview from outside the Sago Baptist Church."I heard this unfolding on our air and I must have said something out loud because there was a print photographer standing beside <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'Did you just say what I think you said?' and I said, 'I think there's only one alive,'" [...] the CNHI News Service quoted Kaye as saying.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{is true that}} meat be apportioned <b>me</b> <b>and</b> mine," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "But it is ofttimes old and tough, this meat, and, moreover, it has {{an unusual}} {{quantity}} of bones." ...|$|R
2500|$|I said, [...] "I {{love the}} script and I love you, but I am a little afraid {{after all these years}} of playing heroines to go into an out-and-out killer." [...] And Mr. Wilder – and rightly so – looked at <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Well, are you a mouse or an actress?" [...] And I said, [...] "Well, I hope I'm an actress." [...] He said, [...] "Then do the part". And I did and I'm very {{grateful}} to him.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to directing some television work, Bogdanovich returned to acting with a recurring guest {{role on the}} cable television series The Sopranos, playing Dr. Melfi's psychotherapist, also later directing a fifth-season episode. He also voiced the analyst of Bart Simpson's therapist in an episode of The Simpsons, and appeared as himself in the [...] "Robots Versus Wrestlers" [...] episode of How I Met Your Mother along with Arianna Huffington and Will Shortz. Quentin Tarantino also cast Bogdanovich as a disc jockey in [...] and [...] [...] "Quentin knows, because he's such a movie buff, that when you hear a disc jockey's voice in my pictures, it's always me, sometimes doing different voices," [...] said Bogdanovich. [...] "So he called <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'I stole your voice from The Last Picture Show for the rough cut, but I need you {{to come down and}} do that voice again for my picture...'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{told the}} {{president}} all that had happened from the time Grandfather Fox met <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> when I had finished the story: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can't look at <b>me</b> <b>and</b> lie," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "Now--what's {{wrong with}} you? You're keeping {{something}} from me. Well, I've got a secret, too, and I intend {{to tell it}} presently." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yesterday, {{when the}} {{governor}} met us, Corny called <b>me</b> Rectus, <b>and</b> even <b>he</b> <b>said</b> {{that was a}} curious name, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> didn't remember that I gave it to him, when he wrote that paper for us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{will they}} turn us out? Can they take our house? It is our house--mine and my sister's; {{here are the}} deeds that my father gave <b>me</b> long ago; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> they were recorded." [...] Her voice grew shrill.|$|R
6000|$|... "For heaven's sake, no!" [...] she insisted. [...] "Don't leave me. I wouldn't {{have him}} come near me for {{anything}} in the world. It {{is only a few}} weeks ago that I begged him to come to London with <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that he hated the place. You don't know--the woman?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Saunders, the pro. at home, {{always says}} that Mike's {{going to be}} the star cricketer of the family. Better than J. W. even, he thinks. I asked him what he thought of <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'You'll be making a lot of runs some day, Mr. Bob.' There's a subtle difference, isn't there? I shall have Mike cutting me out before I leave school if I'm not careful." ...|$|E
6000|$|The lad answered: 'I {{watched the}} date tree till the cocks were crowing {{and it was}} getting light; then I lay down for a little, and I slept.

5000|$|His main passion {{outside work}} and {{politics}} is rock music. In his spare time, he watches bands perform live in local venues and, in his maiden speech, he pledged {{that he would}} wear an Iron Maiden T-shirt in the Chamber. On 15 December 2011, Weatherley {{announced that he was}} unable to fulfil his pledge, explaining, [...] "It's not allowed in the Commons, I asked the Speaker if he'd give <b>me</b> permission <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> no." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And then <b>he</b> {{looked at}} <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> at last <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'Are you {{in love with}} Dick Dewy?' And I said, 'Perhaps I am!' <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'I wish you weren't then, for I want to marry you, with all my soul.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|Considine's face wore {{a troubled}} look. [...] "I fear," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "the news will {{distress}} you, for what I heard {{was that the}} three men, driven to desperation by the harsh treatment received from their master, have joined one of the fiercest of these gangs of robbers, called the Bergenaars--the gang led, I believe, by Dragoener. It was Lucas Van Dyk, the hunter, who told <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> is <b>said</b> to be generally correct in his statements." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Poor Pa," [...] said Caddy, [...] "only {{cried and}} said he hoped we might get on better than he and Ma had got on. He didn't say so before Prince, he only said so to <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'My poor girl, {{you have not been}} very well taught how to make a home for your husband, but unless you mean with all your heart to strive to do it, you had better murder him than marry him--if you really love him.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I demanded {{why he had}} {{dared to}} chase <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> he had an {{important}} message for Nell. This was it: 'Tell your sister that Beasley means to put her off an' take the ranch. If she'll marry me I'll block his deal. If she won't marry me, I'll go in with Beasley.' Then {{he told me to}} hurry home and not to breathe a word to any one except Nell. Well, here I am--and I seem to have been breathing rather fast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Them two clever ones had him {{all alone}} to themselves. Jeremiah come a dancing at me {{sideways}}, after I had let you out (he always comes a dancing at me sideways when he's {{going to hurt}} <b>me),</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to me, [...] "Now, Affery," [...] he said, [...] "I am a coming behind you, my woman, and a going to run you up." [...] So he took and squeezed {{the back of my}} neck in his hand, till it made me open MY mouth, and then he pushed me before him to bed, squeezing all the way. That's what he calls running me up, he do. Oh, he's a wicked one!' ...|$|E
60|$|We were to {{pass the}} night, Mr. Kenge told us when we arrived in his room, at Mrs. Jellyby's; <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> turned to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> {{took it for granted}} I knew who Mrs. Jellyby was.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dick, I shot a {{bear and}} helped to tie up a cub," [...] I said. And then I told him all that had {{happened}} from the time I scrambled out of the spring-hole till I was discovered up in the loft. Dick shook his head, {{as if he did}} not know what to make of <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> all <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was that <b>he</b> would give a year's pay to have me safe back in Pennsylvania.|$|R
5000|$|The {{character}} {{is based on}} the show's creator Josh Schwartz who told: [...] "The dynamic between Sandy and Seth is very much based on <b>me</b> <b>and</b> my dad. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> about Sandy: [...] "He is never a man who can refuse to help someone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have spoken}} to my uncle about you, {{and he will be}} glad to appoint you to the {{position}} of purchaser, for our house, of teak and other native products in these provinces. Besides being buyer, you would go up the country, and see to the felling and getting the timber down to the coast, as you have often done before. He knows how absolutely I trust you, and how much you have done for <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that he should be very glad to have you in charge of the buying side of the work, here. Besides, you know you have now a wife and children and, even if you could make yourself comfortable in England, they {{would never be able to}} do so; and the bitter cold that we sometimes have, in winter, would try them terribly, and might even carry them all off." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{came back}} to town quietly, taking a bus to Hyde Park Corner. Jonathan thought it would {{interest}} me {{to go into the}} Row for a while, so we sat down. But there were very few people there, and it was sad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs. It made us think of the empty chair at home. So we got up and walked down Piccadilly. Jonathan was holding me by the arm, the way he used to in the old days before I went to school. I felt it very improper, for you can't go on for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit. But it was Jonathan, and he was my husband, and we didn't know anybody who saw us, and we didn't care if they did, so on we walked. I was looking at a very beautiful girl, in a big cart-wheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano's, when I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> under his breath, [...] "My God!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's hard on me, sir," [...] she said, [...] "at my age {{to make a}} change. I've {{lived at}} this house, and I've took toll at that gate ever since I was a girl, long before the captain came here, and I've been with him a long time. My people used to own this house, but they all died, and when the place was sold and the captain bought it, he heard about <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> I should always have charge of the old toll-gate when he wasn't attendin' to it himself, {{just the same as}} when my father was alive and was toll-gate keeper, and I was helpin' him. But I've got to go now, and where I'm goin' to is more'n I know. But I'd rather go to the county poorhouse than stay here, or {{anywhere}} else, with Maria Port. She's a regular boa-constrictor, that woman is! She's twisted herself around people before this and squeezed the senses out of them; and that's exactly what she's doin' with the captain. If she could come here to live and bring her old father, and get him to sell the house in town and put the money in bank, and then if she could worry her husband and her father both to death, and work things so she'd be a widow with plenty of money and a good house and as much farm land as she wanted, and a toll-gate where she could set all day and take toll and give back lies and false witness as change, she'd be the happiest woman on earth." ...|$|E
5000|$|In September 1972, Flack {{was opening}} for Marvin Gaye at the Greek Theater; after {{performing}} her prepared encore song, Flack was advised by Gaye to sing an additional song. Flack later said, [...] "I said well, I got this song I've {{been working on}} called 'Killing <b>Me</b> Softly...' <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> 'Do it, baby.' And I did it and the audience went crazy, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> walked over to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> {{put his arm around}} <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said, 'Baby, don't ever do that song again live until you record it.|$|R
6000|$|... "So quiet, my lady, that Sir Eustace {{has ordered}} <b>me</b> to bed, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> himself should come {{down for a}} short sleep presently.

5000|$|And lest I {{should be}} exalted above measure through the {{abundance}} of the revelations, there {{was given to me}} a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. 8 For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from <b>me.</b> 9 <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> unto <b>me,</b> My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. (KJV) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A little later, we {{went down}} to the river, by the Nana's orders. There some men had got boats together, and were putting the Feringhees into them. It was getting dark, and we all went down to guard them. A few of them had got into the boats; the rest were on the bank. I can see it all now: the white men with their proud looks abashed, going meekly into the boats, and the women stepping, all afraid and {{shrinking}} from the black faces--shrinking from us as if we were unclean and they would lose caste by touching us. Though they were so frightened, they were proud still. Then three guns went off somewhere in the camp. Chunder Lal was near <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to me, 'That is the signal for us to fire. The Nana ordered me to fire when I heard those guns.' I don't know if it was true: perhaps the Nana ordered it, perhaps Chunder Lal told a lie: but I never could find out the truth about it, for they blew Chunder Lal from the guns at Cawnpore afterwards, and I have never seen the Nana since to ask him. At any rate, I levelled my musket and fired. I hit an officer Sahib, and wounded him, not mortally. In a moment there was a great report, and I looked round, and saw all our men firing. I don't know if they had the word of command, but I think not. I think they all saw me fire, and fired because I did, and because they thought it a shame to let the Feringhees escape; as though the head man of a village should entrap a tiger, a man-eater that had killed many cultivators in their dal-fields, and then should let it go. If a headman ordered the villagers to loose it from the trap, do you think they would obey him? No, and if he loosed it himself, they would take muskets and sticks and weapons of all kinds, and kill the man-eater at once. That is what we did with the Feringhees.|$|E
5000|$|The {{part of a}} psychopathic {{killer was}} {{completely}} different to anything Fabian had done. [...] "Robert Altman wasn't sure that I could do it," [...] recalls the singer.

5000|$|He said, [...] "Everybody has a club or an {{association}} or some kind—lumber jacks, undertakers, rug weavers, even garbage collectors—so I don’t {{see why we}} can’t have one, too."

6000|$|... 'Yes, Miss Louisa, I know it was, now. Then Mr. M'Choakumchild <b>said</b> <b>he</b> {{would try}} <b>me</b> again. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> This schoolroom is an immense town, {{and in it}} {{there are a million}} of inhabitants, and only five-and-twenty are starved to death in the streets, {{in the course of a}} year. What is your remark on that proportion?

And that was wrong, too.' ...|$|R
