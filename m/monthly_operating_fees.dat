40|$|Issue: Wood waste {{processors}} must set {{a tipping}} fee (receiving charge) that allows their {{business to be}} profitable. The tipping fee must cover expenses yet, remain competitive with other local recycling or disposal options. Also, an acceptable profit margin per unit (cubic yard or ton) of incoming material should be considered. Establishing a tipping fee ensures that the facility operates profitably. Best Practice: This Best Practice outlines the process for determining the tipping fee at a new or existing facility. Implementation: The tipping fee is perhaps the only variable of the facility’s financial system. Therefore, calculating the desired tipping fee requires “working backwards. ” The cost to process the wood waste (processing costs) {{is determined by the}} facility’s <b>monthly</b> <b>operating</b> expenses and payment capital expenditures. The tipping fee (per unit basis) is determined by dividing the total tipping revenue by the material tonnage or cubic yards of incoming material. Therefore to determine the tipping fee, the tipping revenue must first be calculated using the following equation: Tipping Revenues = (Processing Costs + Profit Margin) - Material Revenues where: 1. Processing Costs = <b>Monthly</b> <b>Operating</b> Expenses + <b>Monthly</b> Payments on Capital Expenditures. Operating Expenses. These expenses are necessary costs to remain in business and typically include the following: • Labor; • Disposal Costs For Removed Contaminants • Overhead (e. g., benefits...|$|R

40|$|There {{are several}} {{thousand}} administrative and <b>operating</b> <b>fees,</b> compared to 23 taxes in China.

Excessive fee collection tends to reduce businesses'investment incentive, aggravate income inequality, breed corruption, and distort the fiscal system. Fee reduction is not possible if the government size and revenue shortage problems of local governments persist. Policy options such as cutting government size are recommended.
