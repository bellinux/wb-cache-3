5|$|Lethbridge's {{economy has}} {{traditionally}} been agriculture-based; however, it has diversified in recent years. Half of the workforce is employed in the health, education, retail and hospitality sectors, and the top five employers are government-based. Several national companies are based in Lethbridge. From its founding in 1935, Canadian Freightways based its head office there until moving operations to Calgary in 1948, though its call centre remains in Lethbridge. Taco Time Canada was based in the city from 1978–1995 before moving to Calgary. Minute <b>Muffler,</b> which began in 1969, is based in Lethbridge. International shipping company H & R Transport has been based in the city since 1955. Braman Furniture, which has locations in Manitoba and Ontario, was headquartered in Lethbridge from 1991–2008.|$|E
5|$|Released in September 2009, the E Series 2 HSV GTS {{incorporated}} {{a more powerful}} motor and drivetrain than other HSV models. It retains the same GM LS3 6.2L V8 engine but {{while the rest of}} the HSV range still have 317kW or 425bhp, the GTS engine is rated at (325kW). Twin bonnet scoops have returned to this model from the styling of the Pontiac G8. Other changes include the availability of launch control on manual versions, a recalibrated version of the magnetic ride control suspension with stiffer springs for the HSV GTS, wider wheels and a new high-flow dual-mode <b>muffler</b> system that produces a throatier roar under heavy acceleration. The E-Series 2 stability control system also has a Competition setting which allows for more wheel slip for special track or motorsport applications. The cruise control brakes the car when it is travelling downhill to ensure its speed stays within one per cent of the set speed. This model has daytime running lights.|$|E

25|$|A <b>muffler</b> is {{a device}} for {{reducing}} the amount of noise emitted by a machine. On internal combustion engines, the engine exhaust blows out through the <b>muffler.</b> The internal combustion engine <b>muffler</b> was invented by Milton O. Reeves who received a patent in 1897.|$|E

40|$|The {{reciprocating}} {{motion of the}} piston(s) of engines and compressors and the associated intake and discharge of gases are responsible for noise radiation to the atmosphere that ranks as a major pollutant of the urban environment. <b>Mufflers</b> have been developed over the last seventy years based on electro–acoustic analogies and experimental trial and error. Passive <b>mufflers</b> based on impedance mismatch, called reflective or reactive <b>mufflers,</b> have been most common in the automobile industry. <b>Mufflers</b> {{based on the principle}} of conversion of acoustic energy into heat by means of highly porous fibrous linings, called dissipative <b>mufflers</b> or silencers, are generally used in heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems. The author has been working in this area for over 27 years. Of late, he has been researching in the vibro–acoustics of hoses used in automotive climate control systems. The present paper gives an overview of the research findings of the author and his students in different aspects of active as well as passive <b>mufflers</b> in the last decade.

50|$|The exhaust {{itself was}} {{unusual for the}} time in that the centre exhaust header was split in two and exited into two <b>mufflers</b> {{much smaller than the}} single <b>mufflers</b> {{supplied}} for the two outboard cylinders. This gave a bike a balanced look with two <b>mufflers</b> per side. The header pipes were all joined via balance tubes, known as Exhaust Coupler Tube System (ECTS), to increase low end torque. This exhaust was continued through to the end of production for the North American market but was dropped from the M model onwards in some other markets.|$|R

In this thesis <b>mufflers</b> with perforated tubes are analyzed by modeling the actual geometry and locations of holes on the perforated tubes. The Direct-mixed-body boundary element method with substructuring is used to model the <b>mufflers.</b> <b>Mufflers</b> of various geometry containing perforated tubes with holes of different sizes and porosity are tested.
