40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{constant}} {{increase in}} the performance and economic accessibiliy of modern calculation and communication systems has directed the interest of both researchers and industry towards the implementation of new forms of highly interactive multimedia communication such as Video on Demand. These systems belong to the Continuous Media (CM) category 1, which feature a continuous flow of data from a service manager (mass storage system) to a <b>multimedia</b> <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> (client). The implementation of CM systems, however, shows up certain important limits in current mass memory technology, which is essentially electromechanical.

40|$|The {{development}} of multimedia applications is {{a branch of}} software {{development of}} increasing importance.

Web technology in particular stands as a medium with great educational value, mainly due to its ability to grant access to training material without any spatial or temporal constraints, thus motivating and attracting new users to experience this novel form of learning. As the Internet constantly evolves, new technologies tend to influence the domains of e-learning. The combination of the Web, multimedia and 3 D graphics has resulted to the implementation of new training tools bearing advanced navigational and interactive functionalities along with appealing user interfaces that encourage learners to actively participate in the learning process.

40|$|Visual {{design in}} general is the {{arrangement}} of information items (e. g., text, images, diagrams, pictures, tables) {{in such a way}} that the resulting product is visually attractive, perceptive, and easily understandable. Visual design issues are raised in many domains of human activity such as user interface design, documentation development, presentation design, and graphic layout. This chapter describes techniques coming from traditional visual design and discusses them in the context of user interface design. When the designer sketches the components of a user interface, she or he first selects appropriate interaction and interactive objects according to the user’s task (Vanderdonckt & Bodart, 1993). The second activity is to determine the basic layout of these selected objects ranging from the most important to the least important: the main application window, the title and menu bars, the functional areas of the application window (e. g., a status bar, a toolbar), all child windows, dialog boxes and panels with their contents. This layout (figure 7. 1) consists of interaction objects and interactive objects. Interaction objects (IO), also called widgets or controls, encompass static objects (e. g., labels, separators, group boxes) and dynamic objects (e. g., edit boxes, radio boxes, option boxes). Interactive objects cover every kind of object that a <b>multimedia</b> <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> could display: static icons, drawings, pictures, images, sketches, video sequences, graphics and so forth.

40|$|Abstract: Searching for and {{selecting}} {{complex products}} on the web is usually a difficult task for consumers mainly {{due to the lack}} of intelligent support or assistance. An advanced solution in an e-commerce setting has to optimize the user search by a customer adapted intelligent assistance that emulates in some way the performance of a human seller. This assistance should comprise customeradapted suggestion and explanation of product types, features, alternatives and special offers on digital markets. The ADVICE approach allows this enhancement of the interaction with the user by: (a) A fluid communication with the user supported by different media in order to achieve an advanced <b>multimedia</b> <b>user</b> <b>interface.</b> (b) A dialogue-based interaction to help user navigation in the commercial web, supporting a genuine integration of semantics and pragmatics, based on a discourse model with a twofold dimension: informational and intentional. (c) A customized configuration of the offer according to the user needs and the evolution of the dialogue. Moreover, improving system ergonomy can only be place-holder for the system intelligence. The implemented version to reach a first step on intelligent assistance in ecommerce is based on an agent-based architecture. The prototype includes the Interface Agent to manage the multimedia presentation, the Interaction Agent to support an advanced user-system interaction and the Intelligent Agent incorporating a knowledge-based model of the e-business and domain related knowledge, that supports the reasoning for advise-giving according with the user needs and the dialogue evolution.

This includes individuals who are blind, partially sighted, deaf, hard of hearing, or dyslexic. The varying requirements of print-disabled users have led us to the notion of enriched media documents that contain redundant alternative representations of the same information. Unlike existing one-document-for-all approaches, we propose a personalization process that customizes these rich media documents to the needs of an individual reader. This paper describes, from an iterative user-centered design perspective, the development of a multimedia reading system for a variety of print-disabled user groups. We address issues of establishing user personalization profiles, as well as adapting and customizing content, interaction, and navigation. Customization of interaction and navigation leads to differences in the <b>user</b> <b>interface,</b> as well as different structural views of indexes.
