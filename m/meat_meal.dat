5|$|Extensively reared animals may subsist {{entirely on}} forage, but more intensively kept {{livestock}} will require energy and protein-rich foods in addition. Energy is mainly derived from cereals and cereal by-products, {{fats and oils}} and sugar-rich foods, while protein may come from fish or <b>meat</b> <b>meal,</b> milk products, legumes and other plant foods, often the by-products of vegetable oil extraction. Pigs and poultry are non-ruminants and unable to digest the cellulose in grass and other forages, so they are fed entirely on cereals and other high-energy foodstuffs. The ingredients for the animals' rations can be grown on the farm or can be bought, {{in the form of}} pelleted or cubed, compound foodstuffs specially formulated for the different classes of livestock, their growth stages and their specific nutritional requirements. Vitamins and minerals are added to balance the diet. Farmed fish are usually fed pelleted food.|$|E
25|$|Some {{researchers}} use chicken mash for feed. A {{plastic pipe}} {{can be cut}} in half lengthwise to make two troughs {{which can be used}} as feeders for mash. Mix laying mash (used for egg-producing hens) into the feed to provide calcium for the snails' shells. Commercial chicken feeding mash is around 16% to 17% protein, from fish meal and <b>meat</b> <b>meal,</b> making it good for growing snails. Supplying mash to hatchlings might reduce cannibalism. Two feeds that snails like and that promote good growth are: (A) broiler finisher mash consisting of 7% broiler concentrate, 58% corn, 16% soya, 18% sorghum, 7% limestone flour (40% Ca); and (B) chicken feed (pellets) for layers consisting of 5% layer concentrate, 10%, corn, 15% soya, 20% sorghum, 44% barley, 6% limestone flour (40% Ca).|$|E
500|$|The caloric {{content and}} {{structure}} of medieval diet varied over time, from region to region, and between classes. However, for most people, the diet tended to be high-carbohydrate, {{with most of the}} budget spent on, and the majority of calories provided by, cereals and alcohol (such as beer). Even though meat was highly valued by all, lower classes often could not afford it, nor were they allowed by the church to consume it every day. In England in the 13th century, meat contributed a negligible portion of calories to a typical harvest worker's diet; however, its share increased after the Black Death and, by the 15th century, it provided about 20% of the total. Even among the lay nobility of medieval England, grain provided 65–70% of calories in the early 14th century, though a generous provision of meat and fish was included, and their consumption of meat increased {{in the aftermath of the}} Black Death as well. In one early 15th-century English aristocratic household for which detailed records are available [...] (that of the Earl of Warwick), gentle members of the household received a staggering [...] of assorted meats in a typical <b>meat</b> <b>meal</b> in the autumn and [...] in the winter, in addition to [...] of bread and [...] of beer or possibly wine (and there would have been two meat meals per day, five days a week, except during Lent). In the household of Henry Stafford in 1469, gentle members received [...] of meat per meal, and all others received , and everyone was given [...] of bread and [...] of alcohol. On top of these quantities, some members of these households (usually, a minority) ate breakfast, which would not include any meat, but would probably include another [...] of beer; and uncertain quantities of bread and ale could have been consumed in between meals. The diet of the lord of the household differed somewhat from this structure, including less red meat, more high-quality wild game, fresh fish, fruit, and wine.|$|E

40|$|The Immobilized Digestive Enzyme Assay (IDEA) {{measures}} the α–amino groups liberated during protein peptide bond hydrolysis. This paper presents the original IDEA system (takes ≈ 2. 5 days) designed for feed ingredients and subsequent kits designed for rapid specific testing of soybean meal (takes ~ 24 h), <b>meat</b> and bone <b>meal</b> (MBM, takes 2 h) and Poultry Complete for all <b>meat</b> <b>meals</b> including feather and poultry byproduct meal (takes 2 h). The original IDEA values correlated {{well with the}} in vivo digestibilities of soyflake processing and demonstrated that both over and under processing can be detected using this technique. Both original IDEA and kits are described including the correlation of the determined IDEA values with in vivo rooster protein digestibility assays. Correlation (r 2) of original IDEA values with in vivo digestibilities (lysine) for soyflake and <b>meat</b> and bone <b>meals</b> was 0. 91 and 0. 71, respectively. Correlation (r 2) of IDEA kit values with in vivo digestibilities (lysine) for soybean and <b>meat</b> and bone <b>meals</b> was 0. 88 and 0. 92, respectively. Both the original IDEA assay and kits are easy to perform. Poultry Complete is the name given to the IDEA kit which provides a better IDEA prediction of feather meal and poultry byproduct meal protein digestibility than the original IDEA MBM kit, and in addition can also provide good prediction of MBM and other <b>meat</b> <b>meals.</b> These {{data suggest that the}} original IDEA system represents a rapid, robust and inexpensive predictor of feed ingredients protein digestibility compared to in vivo methods. The optimized IDEA kit for SBM requires ~ 1 day to run, while MBM and Poultry Complete kits take 2 hours to run, each representing a more rapid predictor of these feed ingredients protein digestibility compared to the original IDEA method as well as in vivo methods...|$|R

5000|$|A second {{meaning of}} khumra is simply [...] "a stricter {{interpretation}} of a Jewish law (Halakha), when two or more interpretations exist". This meaning {{is closely related to}} the first meaning, because people who follow the more lenient interpretation (qulla) believe that their interpretation is the baseline requirement of the law, and that people who observe the stringency are doing something [...] "extra". However, people who observe the khumra, in this sense, believe that they are following the baseline requirement, and to do any less would be to violate halakha entirely. Note that in many cases, a rule followed by the majority (or even totality) of halakha-observant Jews today is a stringency in comparison with more lenient rabbinic opinions which have existed in the past or even today. For example, universal halakhic practice today is to wait at least one hour (and even as much as six hours) after eating meat, before consuming milk. However, Rabbenu Tam, in 12th-century France, ruled that it was sufficient merely to conclude the <b>meat</b> <b>meal</b> by reciting a blessing and removing the tablecloth, and then milk could be consumed immediately. Thus, today's universal halakhic practice of waiting between meat and milk would be considered a khumra in comparison to Rabbenu Tam's ruling.|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 156 {{finishing}} pigs (72 barrows and 84 gilts, initially 110 lb) {{were used to}} determine the effects on growth performance of increasing <b>meat</b> and bone <b>meal.</b> Pigs were housed in an environmentally regulated finishing building, with two pigs per pen. There were six pens of barrows and seven pens of gilts per treatment. Pigs were blocked by initial weight and sex, and then allotted to one of six dietary treatments. The dietary treatments were based on corn-soybean meal, were formulated on a true-ileal-digestible (TID) lysine basis, and were fed in three phases. In each phase, diets contained 0, 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5, 10. 0, or 12. 5 % porcine <b>meat</b> and bone <b>meal.</b> The diets were formulated to 0. 85, 0. 70, and 0. 57 % TID lysine in phases 1, 2, and 3, respectively, slightly less than the pig’s anticipated requirements, so that if the amino acid digestibility of <b>meat</b> and bone <b>meal</b> was different than typical values, changes in growth performance could be observed. Increasing <b>meat</b> and bone <b>meal</b> increased ADG (quadratic, P< 0. 02), decreased ADFI (linear, P< 0. 02), and improved F/G (quadratic, P< 0. 01). Pigs fed 2. 5 or 5. 0 % <b>meat</b> and bone <b>meal</b> had the best ADG and F/G; as <b>meat</b> and bone <b>meal</b> increased to higher concentrations, however, ADG and F/G decreased and were similar to those of pigs fed the control diet. Because the diets were formulated with slightly less than the pig’s anticipated requirements, the results suggest that the <b>meat</b> and bone <b>meal</b> used was relatively high quality and contained greater digestible amino acids than expected. These results suggest that porcine <b>meat</b> and bone <b>meal</b> is a suitable replacement for soybean meal...|$|R
