Depending on their length, the cable stays were made of 55 to 91 high tensile steel cables, or strands, themselves formed of seven strands of steel (a central strand with six intertwined strands). Each strand has triple protection against corrosion (galvanisation, a coating of petroleum wax, and an extruded polyethylene sheath). The exterior envelope of the stays is itself coated along its entire length with a double helical weatherstrip. The idea is to avoid running water which, in high winds, could cause vibration in the stays and compromise the stability of the viaduct.|$|E
5000|$|... 4-Byte READ {{could only}} encode a <b>monoaxial</b> {{hierarchy}} {{with a maximum}} of 4 hierarchical levels. The operational NHS requirement to provide a direct crossmap to both ICD-9-CM and OPCS-4 implied an additional hierarchical level was required. Accordingly, a new scheme was devised with exactly the same technical properties as 4-Byte READ except that the code structure was extended to 5-Bytes. This became known as READ2, or 5-Byte READ. The first release of 5-Byte READ occurred sometime prior to January 1991. The October 2010 release contained 82,967 discrete 5-byte codes (although {{the actual number of}} discrete clinical concepts that may be represented is estimated to be slightly lower - 82,593 - because of duplicate entries).|$|E
50|$|The service {{behaviour}} {{is another}} aspect of great interest because it represents the overall material response to load conditions occurring during the entire life span of the structure. The result {{of this type of}} test represents a fundamental input data for the software used for structural analysis and the determination of the stress distribution in the structure.The biaxial behaviour at breaking load is an important open issue that has not been investigated thoroughly until now. Previous researches demonstrate the difficulties concerning the rupture of a biaxial sample, it has been noted that generally the maximum biaxial tensile strength is lower than the corresponding ultimate tensile strength obtained by means of a <b>monoaxial</b> test. However, the test can be focused on the resistance of a joint, evaluating the strength of welded (high frequency welding, hot element welding), glued and sewn seams or the resistance of clamping plates and Keder rail joints or looped and laced joints.|$|E
5000|$|The next crucial {{stage is}} load application. This {{issue has been}} widely {{investigated}} {{but there is no}} loading path universally adopted by the testing laboratories. It has to be said that the loading cycles mainly depend on the scope of the test and it is unrealistic to consider the possibility of elaborating a single loading path able to fulfil at the same time all the requirements imposed by the investigation of the initial behaviour, the service behaviour, the behaviour at breaking load and long term behaviour. This part of the procedure should provide a valid approach to the establishment of a load profile, describing the effects of the parameters involved, in order to fully investigate the material response according to the required repeatability.Since coated fabrics do not follow an elastic behaviour, once the stress is removed the sample maintains a certain level of permanent strain, a plastic deformation. This behaviour is known as residual strain and is present both in <b>monoaxial</b> and biaxial tests. The main value of residual strain is shown {{between the first and second}} load cycle, decreasing to zero after a number of cycles that depends on the material properties, the applied load and the time for which it has been applied. This is due to the creep of the yarns and the coating material and to the internal frictional effects. In order to obtain a realistic description of the material the strain should be measured within a unique load cycle, assuming equal to zero the strain at pre-stress. For this reason the loading cycle considered for the strain measure is generally preceded by identical cycles in a number sufficient to stabilise the sample response. In order to remove the residual strain previous researches considered adequate the application of five identical loading and unloading cycles, the TensiNet design guide consider three or five repetitions to be sufficient, depending on the testing protocol. While the Membrane Structures Association of Japan [...] prescribes the repetition of the cycles three times, but only for the 1:1 load ratio which separates the others. This offers several advantages in the comparison of readings carried out within the same test and with other tests.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{field of}} {{research}} is the appearance and propagation of tears in the fabric, this issue has been partially investigated [...] and represents a fundamental data in {{the determination of the}} safety factor which should be used for a specific structure. Because tear propagation generally occurs at 25% UTS, the safety factor is generally higher than four. The test is carried out on a sample taken from a dismounted structure or by using conditioned samples of fabric which aim to reproduce the in-situ conditions. The load profile should reproduce the expected overload by pulling the sample until breakage, which should start far from the sample edge and the clamping system. The repetition of the test and different temperatures (generally -20 °C and +70 °C) offers important information about the joint behaviour at extreme conditions, such as heavy snow fall with temperatures below zero or a blast of wind during a hot summer. This type of test is generally required by designers and manufacturers and those in charge of the evaluation of the structure behaviour and the final test of the structure. Finally, in order to prevent collapses due to ponding and fluttering, the creep behaviour should be carefully considered in the design, choosing anchorages which enable periodical re-tensioning according to the predicted fall in the level of pre-stress. It is based on a <b>monoaxial</b> test but an accurate investigation requires the use of virgin cruciform samples of fabric and the force is applied by means of counter weights. The creep is defined as the “increase in strain with time when a constant force is applied” [...] and aims to describe the material behaviour when a constant force is applied {{over a long period of}} time. This has a considerable effect on the design and realisation of the membrane structure because a progressive increase in the material strain leads to a considerable reduction in the level of pre-stress initially induced in the structure. The sample should be maintained at a constant temperature and for specific applications it may require a proper climatic chamber for investigations at high and low temperatures.There are no complete studies about the dynamic behaviour of coated fabric and foils for structural applications. A dynamic test on coated fabrics can evaluate the response under fast loading and unloading cycles due to blasts of wind or other sources of stress. It should consider a conditioned fabric which reproduces the in-situ conditions and the testing apparatus should be able to apply a high speed load profile which is generally not possible with a common testing rig equipped with electric servomotors. The results of this type of test, despite the absence of research which can support these expectations, can highlight anomalies in the fabric strength and in the tear propagation with consequent adjustments in the safety factor applied.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: No {{studies have}} {{compared}} <b>monoaxial</b> and polyaxial pedicle screws {{with regard to}} the von Mises stress of the instrumentation, intradiscal pressures of the adjacent segment and adjacent segment degeneration. METHODS: Short-segment monoaxial/polyaxial pedicle screw fixation techniques were compared using finite element methods, and the redistributed T 11 -L 1 segment range of motion, largest maximal von Mises stress of the instrumentation, and intradiscal pressures of the adjacent segment under displacement loading were evaluated. Radiographic results of 230 patients with traumatic thoracolumbar fractures treated with these fixations were reviewed, and the sagittal Cobb&# 39;s angle, vertebral body angle, anterior vertebral body height of the fractured vertebrae and adjacent segment degeneration were calculated and evaluated. RESULTS: The largest maximal values of the von Mises stress were 376. 8 MPa for the pedicle screws in the short-segment <b>monoaxial</b> pedicle screw fixation model and 439. 9 MPa for the rods in the intermediate <b>monoaxial</b> pedicle screw fixation model. The maximal intradiscal pressures of the upper adjacent segments were all greater than those of the lower adjacent segments. The maximal intradiscal pressures of the <b>monoaxial</b> pedicle screw fixation model were larger than those in the corresponding segments of the normal model. The radiographic results at the final follow-up evaluation showed that the mean loss of correction of the sagittal Cobb&# 39;s angle, vertebral body angle and anterior vertebral body height were smallest in the intermediate <b>monoaxial</b> pedicle screw fixation group. Adjacent segment degeneration was less likely to be observed in the intermediate polyaxial pedicle screw fixation group but more likely to be observed in the intermediate <b>monoaxial</b> pedicle screw fixation group. CONCLUSION: Smaller von Mises stress in the pedicle screws and lower intradiscal pressure in the adjacent segment were observed in the polyaxial screw model than in the <b>monoaxial</b> pedicle screw fixation spine models. Fracture-level fixation could significantly correct kyphosis and reduce correction loss, and adjacent segment degeneration was less likely to be observed in the intermediate polyaxial pedicle screw fixation group...|$|E

However, there is an absence of literature that quantifies the risk of pin insertion for <b>monoaxial</b> fixation. This study aimed to determine the safety of inserting <b>monoaxial</b> pins within the calcaneus to house the Orthofix Calcaneal Mini-Fixator. Five formalin embalmed cadaveric ankle and lower leg specimens were inserted with six <b>monoaxial</b> pins. Careful dissection then revealed the presence of the tendons of peroneus longus and brevis, the sural nerve and the small saphenous vein in relation to these pins. Measurements from each pin to each of these structures were made as the structures transected lines drawn from each pin to two palpable bony landmarks: the inferior tip of the lateral malleolus and the posterosuperior calcaneus. In doing this, the risk posed by each pin could be evaluated. We found that two particular pins, those used to hold the articular surface of the subtalar joint in a reduced position, posed a larger risk of injury to surrounding structures than the remaining pins. These findings therefore suggest that <b>monoaxial</b> fixation of the calcaneus using a six pin approach is a relatively safe method of rectifying calcaneal fractures and thus may serve as a welcome alternative to other methods of calcaneal fixation...|$|E

Our study aimed to assess the mechanical performance of a modified pedicle screw. MethodsIn this study, {{the tail of the}} screw body of the modified pedicle screw was designed to be a cylinder-shaped structure that well matched the inner wall of the screw head and the screw head only rotated around the cyclinder. <b>Monoaxial</b> screws, modified screws and polyaxial screws were respectively assembled into 3 groups of vertebrectomy models simulated by ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) blocks. This model was developed according to a standard for destructive mechanical testing published by the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM F 1717 – 04). Each screw design had 6 subgroups, including 3 for static tension, load compression and torsion tests, and the rest for dynamic compression tests. In dynamic tests, the cyclic loads were 25 %, 50 %, and 75 % of the compressive bending ultimate loads respectively. Yield load, yield ultimate load, yield stiffness, torsional stiffness, cycles to failure and modes of failure for the 3 types of screws were recorded. The results of modified screws were compared with those of <b>monoaxial</b> and polyaxial screws.

In dynamic compression tests, both modified and <b>monoaxial</b> screws showed failures that occurred at the insertion point of screw body into the UHMWPE block, while the polyaxial screw group showed screw body swung up and down the screw head because of loosening of the ball-in-cup mechanism.

40|$|Background: Use of a {{pedicle screw}} {{at the level}} of fracture, also known as an {{intermediate}} screw, has been shown to improve clinical results in managing lumbar fracture, but there is a paucity of biomechanical studies to support the claim. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of adding intermediate pedicle screws {{at the level of}} a fracture on the stiffness of a short-segment pedicle fixation using <b>monoaxial</b> or polyaxial screws and to compare the strength of <b>monoaxial</b> and polyaxial screws in the calf spine fracture model. Materials and Methods: Flexibility of 12 fresh-frozen calf lumbar spine specimens was evaluated in all planes. An unstable burst fracture model was created at the level of L 3 by the pre-injury and dropped-mass technique. The specimens were randomly divided into <b>monoaxial</b> pedicle screw (MPS) and polyaxial pedicle screw (PPS) groups. Flexibility was retested without and with intermediate screws (MPSi and PPSi) placed at the level of fracture in addition to standard screws placed at L 2 and L 4. Results: The addition of intermediate screws significantly increased the stability of the constructs, as measured by a decreased range of motion (ROM) in flexion, extension, and lateral bending in both MPS and PPS groups (P 0. 05), but there was a significant difference between MPS and PPS in flexion and extension in the short-segment fixation group (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: The addition of intermediate screws at the level of a burst fracture significantly increased the stability of short-segment pedicle screw fixation in both the MPS and PPS groups.

40|$|Abstract Background Lumbosacral fusion is a {{relatively}} common procedure that {{is used in the}} management of an unstable spine. The anterior interbody cage has been involved to enhance the stability of a pedicle screw construct used at the lumbosacral junction. Biomechanical differences between polyaxial and <b>monoaxial</b> pedicle screws linked with various rod contours were investigated to analyze the respective effects on overall construct stiffness, cage strain, rod strain, and contact ratios at the vertebra-cage junction. Methods A synthetic model composed of two ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene blocks was used with four titanium pedicle screws (two in each block) and two rods fixation to build the spinal construct along with an anterior interbody cage support. For each pair of the construct fixed with polyaxial or <b>monoaxial</b> screws, the linked rods were set at four configurations to simulate 0 °, 7 °, 14 °, and 21 ° lordosis on the sagittal plane, and a compressive load of 300 N was applied. Strain gauges were attached to the posterior surface of the cage and to the central area of the left connecting rod. Also, the contact area between the block and the cage was measured using prescale Fuji super low pressure film for compression, flexion, lateral bending and torsion tests. Results Our main findings in the experiments with an anterior interbody cage support are as follows: 1) large segmental lordosis can decrease the stiffness of <b>monoaxial</b> pedicle screws constructs; 2) polyaxial screws rather than <b>monoaxial</b> screws combined with the cage fixation provide higher compression and flexion stiffness in 21 ° segmental lordosis; 3) polyaxial screws enhance the contact surface of the cage in 21 ° segmental lordosis. Conclusion Polyaxial screws system used in conjunction with anterior cage support yields higher contact ratio, compression and flexion stiffness of spinal constructs than <b>monoaxial</b> screws system does in the same model when the spinal segment is set at large lordotic angles.

Surgical treatment usually concentrates on the correction of the wrist deformity without correcting the forearm shortening, the latter not being given the same consideration as lower limb shortening. In the presented case, radius and ulna corticotomies were performed and distal forearm deformity and shortening were corrected by two independent <b>monoaxial</b> external fixators, with full pronosupination. It is our belief that simultaneous treatment of forearm shortening and deformity not only results in an improved clinical and functional result, but also provides significant psychological benefit. We recommend long term follow up...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{conductivity}} switching of wideband polymers -plasticized PVC films {{under the influence}} of mono axial pressure is experimentally investigated. For various plasticizers the value of <b>monoaxial</b> pressure, causing jumps of conductivity on four and more orders, changes from units to hundreds bars, and the effect remains at a thickness of films of an order of hundreds micron, that is on two orders more than critical thickness for others wideband polymers. In addition to the reasons stated earlier on the interpretation of anomalies of plastic compounds conductivity, the phenomenological electron-molecular model of dynamic traps is considered, in which local transfer of charges is carried out by mobile segments of the plasticized polymer molecules.

40|$|Acetabular {{reinforcement}} devices (ARDs) {{are frequently}} used as load-sharing devices to allow allograft incorporation in revision hip arthroplasty with massive acetabular bone loss. The {{key to a}} successful reconstruction is robust fixation of the device to the host acetabulum. Interlocking fixation is expected to improve the initial stability of the postoperative construct. However, all commercially available ARDs are designed with non-locking fixation. This study investigates the efficacy of standard ARDs modified with locking screw mechanisms for improving stability in acetabular reconstruction. Three types of ARDs were examined to evaluate the postoperative compression and angular stability: i) standard commercial ARDs, ii) standard ARDs modified with <b>monoaxial</b> and iii) standard ARDs modified with polyaxial locking screw mechanisms. All ARDs were implanted into osteomized synthetic pelvis with pelvic discontinuity. Axial compression and torsion tests were then performed using a servohydraulic material testing machine that measured load (angle) versus displacement (torque). Initial stability was compared among the groups. Equipping ARDs with interlocking mechanisms effectively improved the initial stability at the device/bone interface compared to standard non-locked ARDs. In both compression and torsion experiments, the <b>monoaxial</b> interlocking construct demonstrated the highest construct stiffness (672. 6 ± 84. 1 N/mm in compression and 13. 3 ± 1. 0 N · m/degree in torsion), whereas the non-locked construct had the lowest construct stiffness (381. 4 ± 117. 2 N/mm in compression and 6. 9 ± 2. 1 N · m/degree in torsion) (P < 0. 05). Our study demonstrates the potential benefit of adding a locking mechanism to an ARD. Polyaxial ARDs provide the surgeon with more flexibility in placing the screws {{at the cost of}} reduced mechanical performance. This in vitro study provides a preliminary evaluation of biomechanical performance for ARDs with or without interlocking mechanisms, actual clinical trial deserves to be further investigated in future studies...|$|E
40|$|Production and {{commercialization of}} {{tropical}} and subtropical fruits have strongly {{increased in the}} last decade, particularly in countries with subtropical and Mediterranean climates, with important developmental advances due to significant research efforts, including control of flowering, intensive cultivation systems and use of growth regulators. This chapter covers general aspects such as the definition, classification and importance of tropical and subtropical fruits and their environmental requirements. Due to the different growth behaviour of <b>monoaxial</b> and polyaxial species different case studies covering {{some of the main}} tropical and subtropical fruits, i. e. bananas and papayas (monoaxials) and avocado, mango and cherimoya (polyaxials) are treated separately regarding their edaphoclimatic requirements for production and crop management, making special emphasis in reproductive biology, a key factor on the adaptation of tropical and subtropical fruits to different environments.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{manifestations of}} topological order in <b>monoaxial</b> helimagnet Cr_ 1 / 3 NbS_ 2 by performing transport measurements on ultra-thin crystals. Upon sweeping {{the magnetic field}} perpendicularly to the helical axis, crystals thicker than one helix pitch (48 nm) but much thinner than the magnetic domain size (∼ 1 μm) are found to exhibit sharp and hysteretic resistance jumps. We show that these phenomena originate from transitions between topological sectors with different number of magnetic solitons. This is confirmed by measurements on crystals thinner than 48 nm [...] in which the topological sector cannot change [...] that do not exhibit any jump or hysteresis. Our results show the ability to deterministically control the topological sector of finite-size Cr_ 1 / 3 NbS_ 2 and to detect inter-sector transitions by transport measurements.

40|$|Centre for Telegeomatics Research of the Trieste University, is {{developing}} several methods {{in order to}} evaluate road’s cross slope. This measure is performed by use of instrumentation integrated on MMS vehicle GIGI One. In particular two different approaches are followed. The first one preview using of low cost <b>monoaxial</b> laser scanner IBEO Automotive LD GmbH, synchronized with Applanix POS LV system. With the second one cross slope is calculated by only inertial system data, using a simplified algorithm that describes vehicle dynamics. This paper will present an accuracy control of both methods. This control is realised on two different datasets, relating to the s. s. 58 Strada Nuova per Opicina, joining Trieste to Opicina and the s. s. 1 Aurelia between Rosignano and Campolecciano, near Livorno. The control compares the two method’s results systematically and preview several single point check by tests realised with classic topographic instrumentation...|$|E
