50|$|Ground mica {{is used in}} the well-drilling {{industry}} as an additive to drilling fluids. The coarsely ground mica flakes help prevent the loss of circulation by sealing porous sections of the drill hole. Well drilling muds accounted for 15% of dry-ground mica use in 2008. The plastics industry used dry-ground mica as an extender and filler, especially in parts for automobiles as lightweight insulation to suppress sound and vibration. Mica is used in plastic automobile fascia and fenders as a reinforcing material, providing improved mechanical properties and increased dimensional stability, stiffness, and strength. Mica-reinforced plastics also have high-heat dimensional stability, reduced warpage, and the best surface properties of any filled plastic composite. In 2008, consumption of dry-ground mica in plastic applications accounted for 2% of the market. The rubber industry used ground mica as an inert filler and mold release compound in the manufacture of molded rubber products such as tires and roofing. The platy texture acts as an antiblocking, antisticking agent. Rubber <b>mold</b> <b>lubricant</b> accounted for 1.5% of the dry-ground mica used in 2008. As a rubber additive, mica reduces gas permeation and improves resiliency.|$|E
50|$|The {{physical}} properties of ouricury wax resemble carnauba wax, {{so it can}} be used as a substitute where light color is not required, e.g. in carbon paper inks, <b>molding</b> <b>lubricants</b> and polishes. Its melting point is 81-84 Â°C.|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical studies {{frequently}} {{involve the}} use of strong acids or alkalies which attack most mounting materials (epoxy resins, waxes, etc.) (1) to some extent and result in contamination of the test solution. In our experience, only Teflon has proved fully satis-factory as a mounting material. Three techniques have been described for mounting specimens with Teflon (2 - 4), but each one has certain shortcomings. The method described here has proved sufficiently versatile for mounting both brittle, irregular crystals of so-called "sodium tungsten bronze " (5) and wires of pure zinc. 1. Sodium tungsten bronze. [...] Crystals of the nonstoi-ehiometric ompound Na~WO ~ (where 0. 4 < x < 1) are prepared by electrolytic deposition from a Na~WO 4 + WO 3 melt onto a gold wire. A short length of the wire is left projecting from the crystal for making electrical contact. The crystal is placed in a clean metallographic mounting mold ({{the use of}} Teflon {{eliminates the need for}} <b>mold</b> <b>lubricants)</b> as shown in Fig. 1. The mold is partially filled with a pre-established amount of mold-ing powder (Teflon 8 granular TFE resin) and pressed at about 5000 psi (compression ratio 3 : 1) to form a 89 in. diameter, 3 / 4 in. long pellet. At this point, the com-pact has sufficient mechanical strength to be handled easily. The tip of the gold wire is exposed by cuttin...|$|R
40|$|During {{this quarter}} (1 / 1 / 95 - 9 / 30 / 95), major {{progress}} has been made in the following areas of coal log pipeline research, development and technology transfer: (1) Conceptual design of a test machine based on hydraulic presses to mass-produce 5. 4 -inch-diameter coal logs for testing in a 6 -inch-diameter pipeline has been completed. (2) Conceptual design of a rotary-press machine to produce 1. 9 -inch-diameter coal logs for testing in a 2 -inch-diameter pipeline has also been completed. (3) It has been confirmed through experiments that molds with round-edge exit can make logs as good as those made with tapered exit. (4) Conducted a study to determine the effect of surface condition of <b>mold</b> and <b>lubricants</b> on the quality of coal logs. (5) Completed an evaluation of the effect of fiber (wood pulp) on coal log quality. (6) Prepared an apparatus for testing fast compaction of coal logs [...] 2 second per log. (7) Compacted coal logs in a 5. 3 -inch-diameter mold. (8) Completed a preliminary study to assess vacuum and steam heating systems to enhance coal log production and quality. (9) Changed the small-scale-CLP-demo loop from a once-through system to a recirculating system. (10) Completed revision of CLP economic model and revised the 1993 report...|$|R
5000|$|Self-lubricating plain {{bearings}} have a lubricant {{contained within}} the bearing walls. There are many forms of self-lubricating bearings. The first, and most common, are sintered metal bearings, which have porous walls. The porous walls draw oil in via capillary action and release the oil when pressure or heat is applied. An example of a sintered metal bearing in action {{can be seen in}} self-lubricating chains, which require no additional lubrication during operation. Another form is a solid one-piece metal bushing with a [...] groove channel on the inner diameter that is filled with graphite. A similar bearing replaces the figure eight groove with holes plugged with graphite. This lubricates the bearing inside and out. The last form is a plastic bearing, which has the <b>lubricant</b> <b>molded</b> into the bearing. The lubricant is released as the bearing is run in.|$|R
500|$|The {{following}} are the four steps in traditional die casting, also known as , these are also the basis {{for any of the}} die casting variations: die preparation, filling, ejection, and shakeout. The dies are prepared by spraying the <b>mold</b> cavity with <b>lubricant.</b> The lubricant both helps control the temperature of the die and it also assists in the removal of the casting. The dies are then closed and molten metal is injected into the dies under high pressure; between [...] Once the mold cavity is filled, the pressure is maintained until the casting solidifies. The dies are then opened and the shot (shots are different from castings because there can be multiple cavities in a die, yielding multiple castings per shot) is ejected by the ejector pins. Finally, the shakeout involves separating the scrap, which includes the gate, runners, sprues and flash, from the shot. This is often done using a special trim die in a power press or hydraulic press. Other methods of shaking out include sawing and grinding. A less labor-intensive method is to tumble shots if gates are thin and easily broken; separation of gates from finished parts must follow. This scrap is recycled by remelting it. The yield is approximately 67%.|$|R
50|$|Metal is {{drained from}} the tundish through another shroud {{into the top}} of an open-base copper mold. The depth of the mold can range from 0.5 to 2 m, {{depending}} on the casting speed and section size. The mold is water-cooled to solidify the hot metal directly in contact with it; this is the primary cooling process. It also oscillates vertically (or in a near vertical curved path) to prevent the metal sticking to the <b>mold</b> walls. A <b>lubricant</b> (either powders that melt on contact with the metal, or liquids) is added to the metal in the mold to prevent sticking, and to trap any slag particles - including oxide particles or scale - that may be present in the metal and bring them {{to the top of the}} pool to form a floating layer of slag. The shroud is set so the hot metal exits it below the surface of the slag layer in the mold and is thus called a submerged entry nozzle (SEN). In some cases, shrouds may not be used between tundish and mold ('open-pour' casting); in this case, interchangeable metering nozzles in the base of the tundish direct the metal into the moulds. Some continuous casting layouts feed several molds from the same tundish.|$|R
