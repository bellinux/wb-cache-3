5|$|Examples of {{matching}} include the Head Start program, which requires that recipients provide 20% {{of the total}} annual expenses in either monetary or in-kind contributions. Recipients of these funds may contribute <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> teacher payroll, or may contribute a building to house the program classrooms. However, the federal government requires that in-kind contributions be properly valued and evidenced (such as estimating {{the value of a}} building {{to make sure that it}} meets the 20% of the program budget), and certain programs specifically require that matching be made by contributing money only.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{newspaper}} lacked the necessary 25,000 lire to sponsor the race, the organizers consulted Primo Bongrani, a sympathetic accountant {{at the bank}} Cassa di Risparmio. He proceeded to solicit donations from all over Italy, and succeeded in raising sufficient <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> the operating costs. The prize money came from a casino in San Remo after Francesco Sghirla, a former Gazzetta employee, encouraged them {{to contribute to the}} race. Even Corriere, La Gazzettas rival, donated 3,000 lire.|$|E

50|$|In 1861, Abraham Lincoln in his Annual Message to Congress {{asked that}} the court be given the power to issue final judgments. Congress granted the power with the Act of March 3, 1863, and it {{explicitly}} allowed the judgments to be appealed to the Supreme Court. However, it also modified the law governing the Court so that its reports and bills {{were sent to the}} Department of the Treasury rather than directly <b>to</b> Congress. The <b>moneys</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> these costs were then made a part of the appropriation for the Treasury Department.|$|R

5|$|Shulgin {{spent most}} of his later life at the Farm in Lafayette, California. On April 8, 2008, at the age of 82, he {{underwent}} surgery to replace a defective aortic valve. On November 16, 2010, he suffered a stroke, from which he largely recovered. Also at the close of 2010, a skin-grafting surgery saved his left foot from being amputated. Around this time, Shulgin began showing early signs of dementia, mostly severe loss of short-term memory. With progression of the dementia since 2010, his wife Ann Shulgin had been trying to sell part of their property to raise more <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> care costs.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the canals}} were {{owned by the}} London and North Western Railway, {{restrictions}} were imposed on what they could carry, and the canals failed to make sufficient <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> the interest on mortgages. However, they made a substantial operating profit for some years. Around 1850, the average annual income was £104,638, which yielded a surplus of £45,885. Most of the income was from carrying, and by 1870, income had risen to £143,976, although this only yielded a surplus of £11,727. Total traffic was 855,462 tons in 1858, but this had dropped to 742,315 tons in 1868. The carrying business was expanded in the 1870s, but although turnover increased, operating profits fell dramatically, to just £1,568 in 1876. By 1905, total traffic was 469,950 tons, nearly all of it in boats owned by the company, and between the 1870s and {{the onset of the}} First World War the company sometimes made a small operating profit and sometimes a loss. Following the end of the war, working hours were cut, wages increased, and the cost of materials increased. Losses escalated, to £153,318 on an income of £227,845 in 1920, and carriage by the company ceased in 1921, in an attempt to reduce losses. 433,230 tons of goods carried in 1929 had dropped to 151,144 tons in 1940, by which time income from tolls was £17,763, and total income was £40,985.|$|E
5|$|Arnold {{returned}} to {{working on the}} hydrogen bomb book, but 1987 was the 30th anniversary of the Windscale accident. Rather than let {{the records of the}} accident and subsequent inquiries be released over several years, Arnold persuaded the Public Records Office to release them all at once. In meetings with the various responsible government agencies, the topic of a book about Windscale came up, and Arnold decided to write one, which became Windscale 1957: Anatomy of a Nuclear Accident in 1992. Gowing, in poor health, retired from the UKAEA in 1993. By this time her two research assistants had also left, and Arnold feared that the UKAEA Council would shut down the hydrogen bomb book project, which she hoped to follow up with one on the UK civil nuclear power programme. The UKAEA Council decided to press on with the project, asking Arnold to stay on although she was now over seventy years old. In 1993, she was joined by Katherine Pyne, an aircraft engineer working on a history degree, who became her research assistant for two years. However, the end was in sight. The UKAEA no longer had responsibility for nuclear weapons, and management was not interested in it. With funds for the project almost exhausted, the UKAEA Council decided that Arnold should retire in 1996. She loaded her notes into her car and took them home. Sympathetic friends at the Ministry of Defence found some <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> her expenses, and she doggedly worked on it from home. Britain and the H-Bomb finally appeared in 2001.|$|E

25|$|In August 2015 it was {{announced}} that Boca Juniors's volleyball team will not participate in the Argentine major league (A1) from 2016. The decision was personally taken by Boca Juniors chairman, Daniel Angelici. The club alleged that taking part in a professional league resulted in a hugh commercial deficit so Boca Juniors declined to participate, although the volleyball department had reached an agreement with several sponsors which would put the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> the costs (about A$ 3 million).|$|E
25|$|In 1799, the {{business}} venture with Corri, {{which had never}} been very successful, ran into financial difficulties. Dussek and Corri managed to convince the librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte to lend them <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> their debts. The failure to repay this debt put Corri into Newgate Prison and caused Dussek to flee. Da Ponte believed that Dussek fled to Paris; in fact he returned to Hamburg. The affair ended up bankrupting both Corri and Da Ponte.|$|E
25|$|In {{the back}} of the library's catalog from 1741, Franklin {{mentioned}} that the library was accessible to people who were not members. Those who were not members were allowed to borrow books. However, they had to leave enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> the cost of the book. Apparently, their money was given back upon returning the book. The privilege of being a member meant that books could be borrowed for free. Franklin also mentioned that the library was only open on Saturdays, for four hours in the afternoon.|$|E
50|$|A mild-mannered clerk, George Chedworth, {{is married}} to the snobbish, nagging Julie, and has four children: {{gambling}} addict Arthur, beautiful Gwen, teenage singer Susie and young Fred. Chedworth lends <b>money</b> <b>to</b> Arthur <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> his gambling debts to a bookmaker, and is persuaded by the bookmaker on a long-shot wager.

25|$|Additional {{fundraising}} {{occurred after}} 1910 {{to raise the}} <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> the additional cost. A number of small donations came from Union soldiers, with the 23rd New Jersey Regiment contributing $100 ($). Ezekiel agreed to donate his services as sculptor, {{so that all the}} money set aside for the memorial could go toward the purchase of raw bronze and for the memorial's casting. By February 1912, $24,000 ($) still needed to be raised. Over the next four months, an additional $4,000 ($) came in.|$|E
25|$|Heine now had {{to search}} for a job. He was only really suited to writing but it was {{extremely}} difficult to be a professional writer in Germany. The market for literary works was small and it was only possible to make a living by writing virtually non-stop. Heine was incapable of doing this so he never had enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> his expenses. Before finding work, Heine visited the North Sea resort of Norderney which inspired the free verse poems of his cycle Die Nordsee.|$|E
25|$|Malcolm Macdonald {{took his}} goalscoring form into 1970–71 as Luton did {{extremely}} well {{in their first}} season back in the Second Division, finishing sixth and only seven points away from promotion to the First Division. However, success on the pitch was not matched off it – April saw the club announce a £173,116 loss, and the club appealed to the supporters for <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> their shortfalls. In the end, it was Macdonald himself who ended the crisis as he was sold to Newcastle United for £180,000 a month later.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{organizers}} lacked the funds, 25,000 lira, needed {{to hold the}} race, they consulted Primo Bongrani, an accountant at the bank Cassa di Risparmio and friend of the three organizers. Bongrani proceeded to go around Italy asking for donations to help hold the race. Bongrani's efforts were largely successful, he had procured enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> the operating costs. The money {{that was to be}} given out as prizes came from a casino in San Remo after Francesco Sghirla, a former Gazzetta employee, encouraged it to contribute to the race. Even Corriere, La Gazzettas rival, gave 3,000 lire to the race's fund.|$|E
25|$|Schoendoerffer was {{primarily}} influenced by epic adventure novels, notably Joseph Kessel's Fortune Carrée (1932). Kessel wrote The Devil's Pass (1956) he co-directed with Jacques Dupont. In the late 1950s, he adapted on screen two Pierre Loti novels, first Iceland Fisherman (1886) then Ramuncho (1897). Following his 1992 motion picture Dien Bien Phu, Schoendoerffer {{spent three years}} working on the screen adaptation of his favourite writer Joseph Conrad's Typhoon (1902). The script was ready and the filmmaker started location spotting for shooting but the producer didn’t find enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> the high production budget and so the project was eventually cancelled.|$|E
25|$|When Kentucky {{became a}} state in 1792, Logan was chosen {{as a member of}} the state senate. Just two weeks after the Senate convened for the first time on June 4, 1792, a joint ballot of the House and Senate was taken to select a state treasurer, and Logan was {{unanimously}} chosen for the office. A week after the ballot, he resigned his position in the Senate and assumed the post of treasurer. As treasurer, Logan had the difficult task of financing the state using a combination of currencies from the Netherlands, France, Austria, Prussia, Portugal, Italy, and elsewhere. The situation was complicated when the federal government refused to redeem the paper money issued by the states of Virginia, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina to finance the Revolutionary War, rendering these notes worthless. In the early days of the Commonwealth, tobacco, animal pelts, and land warrants were more useful as currency than paper notes. At times, Logan had to personally borrow <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> the state's obligations.|$|E

25|$|When the Emancipation Proclamation {{went into}} effect in January 1863, ex-slaves were energetically {{recruited}} by the states, and used to meet the state quotas. States and local communities offered higher and higher cash bonuses for white volunteers. Congress tightened the law in March 1863. Men selected in the draft could provide substitutes or, until mid-1864, pay commutation money. Many eligibles pooled their <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> the cost of anyone drafted. Families used the substitute provision to select which man should go into the army and which should stay home. There was much evasion and overt resistance to the draft, especially in Catholic areas. The great draft riot in New York City in July 1863 involved Irish immigrants who had been signed up as citizens to swell the vote of the city's Democratic political machine, not realizing it made them liable for the draft. Of the 168,649 men procured for the Union through the draft, 117,986 were substitutes, leaving only 50,663 who had their personal services conscripted.|$|E
25|$|Subset Games had {{initially}} planned {{to work on}} the title for about a three-month period after saving enough of their own <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> expenses for about a year. The additional attention to the game forced them to extend development - what would be a two-year process - and thus they turned to Kickstarter in order to fund the final polish of the game as well as costs associated to its release, seeking a total funding goal of $10,000. Their Kickstarter approach was considered well-timed, riding on the coattails of the highly successful Double Fine Adventure Kickstarter in March 2012, as well as gaining the attention of top developers like Ken Levine and Markus Persson; with interest spurred in crowd-funded games, Subset games was able to raise over $200,000 through the effort. FTL represents one of the first games to come out from this surge in crowd-funded games, and demonstrates that such funding mechanisms can support video game development.|$|E
25|$|In June 1892, Ranjitsinhji {{left the}} Borrisow home and, with {{monetary}} assistance from relations, moved {{into his own}} rooms {{in the city of}} Cambridge. He lived in luxury and frequently entertained guests lavishly. According to writer Alan Ross, Ranjitsinhji may have been lonely in his first years at Cambridge and probably encountered racism and prejudice. Ross believes that his generosity may have partly arisen from trying to overcome these barriers. However, Ranjitsinhji increasingly lived beyond his means {{to the point where he}} experienced financial difficulty. He intended to pass the examinations to be called to the Bar and wrote to ask Vibhaji to provide more <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> the costs; Vibhaji sent the money on the condition Ranjitsinhji returned to India once he passed the examination. Ranjitsinhji intended to keep to this arrangement, although he did not plan a career as a barrister, but his debts were larger than he had thought and not only could he not afford the cost of the Bar examination, he was forced to leave Cambridge University, without graduating, in spring 1894.|$|E
