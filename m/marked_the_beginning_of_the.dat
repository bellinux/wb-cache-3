5|$|After {{the defeat}} of Austria-Hungary in World War I and the Treaty of Rapallo of 1920, Rijeka became an {{independent}} city-state known as the Free State of Fiume. That <b>marked</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> port's decline, as it lost {{a large portion of}} its major market, Hungary. Italy annexed Rijeka in 1924 by the Treaty of Rome, and the port became peripherally located, with no modern railway or road links {{to the rest of the}} country, further adding to the already obvious economic decline.|$|E

Resentment among the allies for Constantine's policy during World War I prevented Athens from receiving outside support.

5|$|During {{the reign}} of Boris I (r. 852–889) Bulgaria {{underwent}} major changes— the Christianization {{of the country and}} the admission of the disciples of Saints Cyril and Methodius, which <b>marked</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creation and consolidation of the medieval Bulgarian literature and alphabet. Following intense negotiations with the Papacy in Rome and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, Bulgaria converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity, which caused discontent among part of the nobility who directly associated the new religion with the Byzantine Empire and feared that the country would fall under Byzantine influence.|$|E
5|$|Even before Han's {{expansion}} into Central Asia, diplomat Zhang Qian's travels from 139 to 125 BC had established Chinese contacts with many surrounding civilizations. Zhang encountered Dayuan (Fergana), Kangju (Sogdiana), and Daxia (Bactria, formerly the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom); he also gathered information on Shendu (Indus River valley of North India) and Anxi (the Parthian Empire). All {{of these countries}} eventually received Han embassies. These connections <b>marked</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Silk Road trade network that extended to the Roman Empire, bringing Han items like silk to Rome and Roman goods such as glasswares to China.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Hong Kong {{became the}} first of the Four Asian Tiger economies under rapid {{industrialisation}} driven by textile exports, manufacturing industries and re-exports of goods to China.

The construction of the Shek Kip Mei Estate in 1953 <b>marked</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public housing estate programme to provide shelter for the less privileged and to cope with the influx of immigrants.|$|E

5|$|The Siege of Patras in 805 or 807 was {{undertaken}} by the local Slavic tribes of the Peloponnese, reportedly with aid from an Arab fleet. The siege's failure, attributed to the miraculous intervention of the city's patron, Saint Andrew, marked the consolidation of Byzantine control over the Peloponnese peninsula after two centuries of Slavic rule over its western half. It also <b>marked</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ascendancy of the Metropolis of Patras in the peninsula's ecclesiastical affairs.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish coup of July 1936 {{fractured}} the Spanish Republican Armed Forces and <b>marked</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish Civil War. Following {{a period}} of troubles in the Second Spanish Republic, a group of officers attempted to overthrow the left-wing Popular Front government, elected five months previously, in a military coup.

In 1965, the Supreme Court produced some decisions, including Lamont v. Postmaster General (in which the plaintiff was Corliss Lamont, a former ACLU board member), which upheld fifth amendment protections and brought an end to restrictions on political activity.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} that enzymes could be crystallized eventually allowed their structures {{to be solved}} by x-ray crystallography. This was first done for lysozyme, an enzyme found in tears, saliva and egg whites that digests the coating of some bacteria; the structure was solved by a group led by David Chilton Phillips and published in 1965. This high-resolution structure of lysozyme <b>marked</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field of structural biology and the effort to understand how enzymes work at an atomic level of detail.|$|E
