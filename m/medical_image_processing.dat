Generally, image data {{is in the form of}} microscopy images, X-ray images, angiography images, ultrasonic images, and tomography images. An example of information which can be extracted from such image data is detection of tumours, arteriosclerosis or other malign changes. It can also be measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc. This application area also supports medical research by providing new information, e.g., about the structure of the brain, or about the quality of medical treatments. [...] Applications of computer vision in the medical area also includes enhancement of images that are interpreted by humans, for example ultrasonic images or X-ray images, to reduce the influence of noise.|$|E

We propose a novel approach to combining sparse Gabor-feature based classifiers in an ensemble classification framework. The unsupervised nature of this non-parametric technique can significantly reduce the time and effort for system calibration. In particular, classification of <b>medical</b> <b>images</b> in this framework does not rely on segmentation nor semantic- or annotation-based feature selection.

40|$|Medical imaging {{is often}} {{thought of as a}} way of viewing {{anatomical}} structures of the body. Indeed, x-ray computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging yield exquisitely detailed images of such structures. It is often useful, however, to acquire images of physiologic function rather than of anatomy. Such images can be acquired by imaging the decay of radioisotopes bound to molecules with known biological properties. This class of imaging techniques is known as nuclear medicine imaging.

40|$|Interactive {{exploration}} of large distributed collections of complex, non-text data such as <b>medical</b> <b>images</b> is a challenging task {{because of the}} difficulty of creating useful indexes. To handle such tasks, we introduce a new approach to search called discard-based search. In contrast to classic search strategies that precompute indexes for all anticipated queries, discard-based search is an on-demand strategy that performs content-based computation in response to a specific query. This simple change in strategy turns out to have deep consequences for flexibility and user control, while also enabling easy exploitation of CPU and storage parallelism on servers. This paper presents the design and implementation of the OpenDiamond platform for discard-based search, describes some of the applications that have been built with it, and offers experimental evidence that its workloads exhibit easily-exploitable storage parallelism.

40|$|<b>Image</b> <b>processing</b> {{is a form}} {{of signal}} processing(analysis, interpretation, and {{manipulation}} of signals) forwhich the input is an image, such as photographs; the outputof <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> can be either an image or a set ofcharacteristics or parameters related to the image. Typicaloperations of <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> are geometrictransformations such as enlargement, reduction androtation, color corrections such as brightness and contrastadjustments, quantization, or conversion to a different colorspace, interpolation and recovery of a full image from a rawimage format, image editing, image differencing, imagestabilization, image segmentation and other. Applications ofthese operations are encountered in computer vision, facedetection, feature detection, <b>medical</b> <b>image</b> processing,microscope <b>image</b> <b>processing,</b> morphological imageprocessing, remote sensing and many other disciplines.
