25|$|I {{felt that}} air {{was forced into}} <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> I could not speak and I could not close <b>my</b> <b>mouth.</b> I could {{understand}} well everything said to me.

25|$|The {{left side}} of <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> felt numb and started jerking and pulling to the left, and I could not speak to say what was {{happening}} to me.|$|E
25|$|<b>My</b> <b>mouth</b> {{opened and}} I could not speak. I {{wanted to say}} I cannot speak. At the same time, {{it was as if}} {{somebody}} was strangling me.|$|E
25|$|I {{jumped into}} a seal hole, pushing the ice away as I entered, and they handed me my camera. Surprisingly, I wasn't too cold, except around where <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> {{held on to}} my regulator, and that {{instantly}} froze and became numb. Suddenly everything was quiet and I found myself looking at easily {{one of the most}} extraordinary scenes I had ever, ever experienced. When I dropped down {{through a hole in the}} ice, I was completely surrounded by ice: a tunnel maybe twenty feet across. Everything above me on the land was roaring with wind and down there, there was absolutely no sound except for the distant trills of Weddell seals.|$|E

500|$|Historian Donald {{described}} the speech as a [...] "superb political move for an unannounced candidate, {{to appear in}} one rival's (Seward) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival's (Chase) loyalists, while not mentioning either by name during its delivery".

Shortly after Poitier's refusal, Zemeckis saw a NASA announcement in August 1996. [...] "Clinton gave his Mars rock speech," [...] the director explained, [...] "and I swear to God it was like it was scripted for this movie.
