40|$|Children's {{emerging}} morality {{involves the}} development of <b>moral</b> emotions and <b>moral</b> cognition. Developmental research suggests that emotions {{play an important role}} in dealing with <b>moral</b> conflict situations, and they help children differentiate <b>moral</b> concepts from other social judgments. However, emotions and their role in <b>moral</b> cognition and <b>moral</b> behavior have yet to be addresses systematically in empirical research. In this volume, the authors show how integrative developmental research on children's <b>moral</b> emotions and <b>moral</b> cognition can help us understand how children's morality evolves. As both <b>moral</b> emotions and <b>moral</b> cognition are related to children's <b>moral,</b> prosocial behavior, as well as to their immoral, aggressive behavior, studying how <b>moral</b> emotions and <b>moral</b> cognition interact is not only of conceptual significance to developmental researchers, but also of practical importance to educators. A central premise of the volume is that <b>moral</b> emotions interact with <b>moral</b> cognition in different ways across development. An integrative developmental perspective on <b>moral</b> emotions and <b>moral</b> cognition thus offers an important conceptual framework for understanding children's emerging morality and designing developmentally sensitive <b>moral</b> intervention strategies. The authors summarize the empirical literature linking <b>moral</b> emotions to <b>moral</b> cognition and discuss promising conceptual avenues and methodological approaches to study children's <b>moral</b> emotions and <b>moral</b> cognition. They also provide examples illustrating how the principles of integrative <b>moral</b> education can be applied in educational practice...|$|R

40|$|<b>Moral</b> {{decision-making}} {{in business}} means the decisions involved in <b>moral</b> issues in business context. <b>Moral</b> intensity is a construct that captures {{the extent of}} issue-related <b>moral</b> imperative in a situation, {{which is one of}} the most important factors in the study of <b>moral</b> decision-making in business. Based on Issue-Contingent Model, the present study investigated the influence of <b>moral</b> intensity on <b>moral</b> decision-making in business (including <b>moral</b> recognition, <b>moral</b> judgment, and <b>moral</b> intent in the present study), and further focused on exploring the mechanism of <b>moral</b> intensity in <b>moral</b> decision-making in business. Recently, the studies in decision-making gave more emphasis to the role of emotions. The present study tried to include empathy into <b>moral</b> decision-making in business to explore the role of empathy in the relationship between <b>moral</b> intensity and <b>moral</b> decision-making in business, which would enrich and extend Issue-Contingent Model. The present study would also make up for a deficiency in the study of <b>moral</b> decision-making in business that overemphasized the rational reasoning and neglected the role of emotions. There were three parts in the present study. Firstly, study 1 replicated the former study and explored the relationship between perceived <b>moral</b> intensity and <b>moral</b> decision-making in business in China by questionnaire method. Secondly, study 2 focused on exploring the influence of the components of <b>moral</b> intensity on <b>moral</b> decision-making in business and empathic response by experimental method. Finally, study 3 explored the role of empathy in the relationship between <b>moral</b> intensity and <b>moral</b> decision-making in business. The results indicated that, 1. Perceived <b>moral</b> intensity was the significant predictor for <b>moral</b> decision- making in business. 2. Magnitude of consequence, social consensus, and probability of effect had significant effects on <b>moral</b> decision-making in business. Magnitude of consequence and probability of effect could influence empathic response significantly. 3. Empathic response played the role of mediator between <b>moral</b> intensity and <b>moral</b> decision-making in business. Empathic response completely mediated the relationship between <b>moral</b> intensity and <b>moral</b> recognition. Empathic response partly mediated the relationship between <b>moral</b> intensity and <b>moral</b> judgment, <b>moral</b> intent. Further analysis indicated that probability of effect and magnitude of consequence relied more on empathic response than social consensus to influence <b>moral</b> judgment and <b>moral</b> intent. Dispositional empathy could influence <b>moral</b> decision-making in business through perceived <b>moral</b> intensity and empathic response. 4. Controlled empathic levels could influence <b>moral</b> decision-making in business significantly. Empathic levels influenced the effect of probability of effect on <b>moral</b> decision-making in business, and did not influence the effect of magnitude of consequence and social consensus on <b>moral</b> decision-making in business. These findings not only contribute to enrich the models of <b>moral</b> decision- making in business, but also have significant practical applications in the training of <b>moral</b> decision-making in business. 企业道德决策指在企业背景下出现的一类涉及道德问题的决策。道德强度指某一情境中与问题相关的道德紧迫程度，它是影响企业道德决策的重要因素之一。本研究基于问题权变模型，考察道德强度对企业道德决策（本研究中涉及道德识别、道德判断和道德意图三个阶段）的影响，注重探讨道德强度对企业道德决策的作用机制。在决策研究日益强调情绪作用的背景下，本研究引入了一种重要的道德情绪——移情，系统考察移情在道德强度对企业道德决策影响中的作用，丰富并拓展了问题权变模型，也弥补了以往企业道德决策研究过分强调理性推理，而忽视情绪因素的不足。 本研究分为三部分。研究一重复前人的研究，采用问卷法，考察在中国背景下主观道德强度对企业道德决策的预测作用；研究二采用实验法，考察道德强度的不同成分对企业道德决策和移情反应的影响；研究三综合运用问卷法和实验法，考察移情在道德强度对企业道德决策影响中的作用。研究结果表明： 1. 主观道德强度对企业道德决策具有显著的预测作用。 2. 道德强度中的结果大小、社会舆论和效应可能性这三种成分对企业道德决策具有显著影响；结果大小和效应可能性对移情反应具有显著影响。 3. 移情反应在道德强度与企业道德决策的关系中具有中介作用。移情反应在道德强度与道德识别的关系中具有完全中介作用，而在道德强度与道德判断和道德意图的关系中具有部分中介作用。进一步分析发现，结果大小和效应可能性会比社会舆论更多地通过移情反应对道德判断和道德意图产生影响。移情关怀特质会通过影响主观道德强度和移情反应作用于企业道德决策。 4. 通过操纵个体的移情水平可以影响企业道德决策。移情水平可以影响效应可能性对道德决策的效应，但不影响结果大小和社会舆论对道德决策的效应。 上述发现对于丰富目前的企业道德决策模型具有重要的理论意义。对于企业中的道德决策培训也具有重要的实践意义...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Moral</b> Naturalism is {{the view}} that <b>moral</b> {{judgments}} aim at describing <b>moral</b> facts and that these are ordinary garden-variety natural facts. <b>Moral</b> Naturalism has trouble accounting for the intuition that we cannot outsource <b>moral</b> judgments, i. e., we cannot ground a <b>moral</b> conviction that p {{on the fact that}} a reliable <b>moral</b> adviser holds that p. There have been, however, several attempts to explain this intuition away or to discredit the intuition pumps that bring it forward. I argue that <b>moral</b> naturalists are {{not in a position to}} deny this intuition. <b>Moral</b> Naturalism embodies a conception of the minimal conditions for someone to qualify as capable of making <b>moral</b> judgments; among these conditions is the acknowledgment of the supervenience of the <b>moral</b> on the non-moral; given the naturalist's conception of what it takes for someone to be capable of <b>moral</b> judgment, if we allow agents to outsource their <b>moral</b> judgments we come to situations in which the convictions of <b>moral</b> agents do not comply with the acknowledgment of <b>moral</b> supervenience. The naturalist must, therefore, deny the possibility of <b>moral</b> outsourcing. <b>Moral</b> Naturalism, then, faces the problem of making sense of the ban on <b>moral</b> outsourcing...|$|R

40|$|<b>Moral</b> hedging is a {{coherent}} phenomenon and a prevalent feature of our <b>moral</b> experiences. Furthermore, it {{is a method}} of <b>moral</b> decision-making {{that is capable of}} determining which actions make the most <b>moral</b> sense, in instances of <b>moral</b> uncertainty. The phenomenon of <b>moral</b> hedging can teach us a lot about the nature of morality and <b>moral</b> experiences; for example, the realm of the normative may not admit of normative treatment, reflective reasoning about <b>moral</b> matters can only take us so far with respect to determining which actions make the most <b>moral</b> sense, good <b>moral</b> decisions need not always be epistemically reasonable or reflective justified, morality is in important senses personal, intuitions of a <b>moral</b> modality are legitimate occurrences, and there are limits to the scope of <b>moral</b> authority. Despite these insights, <b>moral</b> hedging is incompatible with <b>moral</b> integrity. This is because it involves a recognition of the epistemic fallibility of one’s <b>moral</b> judgement that the person of <b>moral</b> integrity does not act on. This doesn't make the <b>moral</b> hedger epistemically vicious, but it does mean that the <b>moral</b> hedger is worthy of <b>moral</b> disapprobation, both in the eyes of others, and by the lights of her own <b>moral</b> convictions. Consequently, <b>moral</b> hedging involves not only undermining one’s self-identity, but also forsaking the worth of one’s character and one’s <b>moral</b> integrity. <b>Moral</b> integrity involves acting on a <b>moral</b> calling that cannot be rationally or reflectively accounted for; it is an irrational and pre-reflective decision-making procedure that cannot be illegitimised on these grounds.

50|$|While Kohlberg (1983) {{emphasized}} {{the role of}} <b>moral</b> reasoning and Hoffman (1971; 2001) {{emphasized the}} role of <b>moral</b> emotion in <b>moral</b> action, empirical studies showed that reasoning and emotion only moderately predicted <b>moral</b> action. Scholars, such as Blasi (1980; 1983), began proposing identity as a motivating factor in <b>moral</b> motivation. Blasi proposed the self model of <b>moral</b> functioning, which described {{the effects of the}} judgment of responsibility to perform a <b>moral</b> action, one's sense of <b>moral</b> identity, and the desire for self-consistency on <b>moral</b> action. Studies of <b>moral</b> exemplars have shown that exemplary <b>moral</b> action often results from the intertwining of personal goals and desires with <b>moral</b> goals, and studies on <b>moral</b> behavior also show a correlation between <b>moral</b> identity and action.

Hardy and Carlo (2005) raise critical questions about Blasi's model as well as the topic in general, such as the nature of the causal relationship between <b>moral</b> identity and behavior, the presence of mediating or moderating variables in the relationship, how <b>moral</b> identity relates to more automatic and unconscious <b>moral</b> behavior, and more.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the association between work-related <b>moral</b> stress, <b>moral</b> climate and <b>moral</b> sensitivity in mental health nursing. By means of the three scales Hospital Ethical Climate Survey, <b>Moral</b> Sensitivity Questionnaire and Work-Related <b>Moral</b> Stress, 49 participants’ experiences were assessed. The results of linear regression analysis indicated that <b>moral</b> stress was determined to a degree by the work place’s <b>moral</b> climate as well as by two aspects of the mental health staff’s <b>moral</b> sensitivity. The nurses’ experience of ‘moral burden’ or ‘moral support’ increased or decreased their experience of <b>moral</b> stress. Their work-related <b>moral</b> stress was determined by the job-associated <b>moral</b> climate and two aspects of <b>moral</b> sensitivity. Our findings showed an association between three concepts: <b>moral</b> sensitivity, <b>moral</b> climate and <b>moral</b> stress.
