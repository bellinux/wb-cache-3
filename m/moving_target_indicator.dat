30|$|Conventional <b>moving</b> <b>target</b> <b>indicators</b> adopt multi-antennae technique, {{and they}} {{generally}} require a calibrated and time-invariant radar system.

Recently many GMTI methodologies based on a single antenna SAR or a single complex-valued SAR image, e.g., auto-focusing [11], antenna beam patten transforming [12], and SAR stacks [13], were developed and got many effective results. However, the proposed methods suffer from either a high computation effort or unsatisfactory estimate accuracy under the condition of high signal-to-clutter-plus-interference-ratio.|$|R

25|$|The most {{effective}} clutter reduction technique is pulse-Doppler radar. Doppler separates clutter from {{aircraft and spacecraft}} using a frequency spectrum, so individual signals can be separated from multiple reflectors located in the same volume using velocity differences. This requires a coherent transmitter. Another technique uses a <b>moving</b> <b>target</b> <b>indicator</b> that subtracts the receive signal from two successive pulses using phase to reduce signals from slow moving objects. This can be adapted for systems that lack a coherent transmitter, such as time-domain pulse-amplitude radar.|$|E

The Rajendra is a high power Passive electronically scanned array radar (PESA), with the ability able to guide up to 12 Akash SAMs against aircraft flying at low to medium altitudes. The Rajendra has a detection range of 80km with 18km height coverage against small fighter sized targets {{and is able to}} track 64 targets, engaging 4 simultaneously, with up to 3 missiles per target. The Rajendra features a fully digital high speed signal processing system with adaptive <b>moving</b> <b>target</b> <b>indicator,</b> coherent signal processing, FFTs and variable pulse repetition frequency.

30|$|This {{condition}} {{forms the}} basis for estimating the moving targets' parameters. In the SFrFT domain with a proper α, the spectra of any strong <b>moving</b> <b>target</b> will concentrate to a narrow impulse, {{and that of the}} clutter will be spread.
