2500|$|At a {{campaign}} rally, Paul said that whistleblowers are [...] "the ones who need immunity." [...] Alluding to Daniel Ellsberg and Chelsea Manning, Paul said, [...] "So {{if we have}} an American citizen {{and is willing to}} take the consequences and practice civil disobedience and say this is what our government's doing, should he be locked up and in prison, or should we see him as a political hero? <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a true patriot who reveals what's going on in government." [...] However, Paul voted against the Offshore Oil and Gas Worker Whistleblower Protection Act of 2010.|$|E
6000|$|... "He'd fly quick enough--if he could," [...] said Snap. [...] "There is {{something}} wrong with him. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> caught fast in the crotch of the limb." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! on the mountains. But {{there is}} a man out yonder. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the one who your father said would carry my letters to the post." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor fellow! <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{afraid if}} <b>he</b> came towards the school <b>he</b> would <b>be</b> arrested. If <b>he</b> had a {{suitcase}} <b>he</b> couldn't have <b>been</b> {{just an ordinary}} tramp. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> some working man {{looking for a job}} and without the price of a night's lodging." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> right. It was his half-dozen {{glasses that}} troubled Harris and myself.|$|R
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> clearly shown {{fighting}} {{alongside his}} fellow Decepticon Triple Changers {{again in the}} Japanese anime, The Headmasters. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> reintegrated on Decepticon's ranks with the parole of Scorponok ...|$|R
6000|$|Hans Nelson {{looked at}} the empty chair, shook his head slowly, and, with a {{ponderous}} attempt at humor, said: [...] "Always is he first at the grub. It is very strange. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> sick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So does a bomb--until it goes off," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "The cowboys wouldn't {{be afraid}} of him unless he was a bad one. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> really crazy. I've heard of a crazy horse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It’s a hard matter, lad, to know men’s ways, I find, {{since the}} {{settlers}} {{have brought in}} their new fashions, But is there nothing to be found out in the place? and <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> troubled with his longings after other people’s business, as he often is” ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Sleeping Powder" [...] was {{the first}} song to be {{recorded}} and released {{after the release of}} Humanz. Through deliberate design (and in contrast to Humanz), it doesn't feature any musical collaborators. Damon Albarn, speaking through the perspective of fictional band member 2-D, explained this decision: [...] "2-D felt <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unrepresented on Humanz. It wasn't a problem, but <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a bit too generous, you know? So he thought he'd do a song just by himself, and make a video just with him, and not tell anyone else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "His {{legs and}} some ribs <b>are</b> broken; <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> washed aneath the launch. But yon's no a'. When the boats came off Juan and Miguel {{were not on}} board." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I know, David, I know! You {{would save}} {{me if you}} could. But maybe --maybe it ain't what we think it <b>is.</b> <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> outlawed by staying away so long?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} secret," [...] I answered. [...] "Only the inner chiefs {{could have known}} up to to-day. We haven't yet {{penetrated}} that far, so we couldn't escape being kept in the dark. If only Ernest were here. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> in Chicago now, and all is well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has got a}} {{way with}} him," [...] she reflected, as she cleared up the relics of the supper. [...] "It is real queer he is not married, for {{a man like that}} could have anybody for the asking. Well, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> like me, and has not met the right one yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At Dawson {{comes the}} man. Which way he come I do not know. Only do I {{know he is}} checha-quo--what you call tenderfoot. His hands are soft, just like hers. He never do hard work. He is soft all over. At first I think <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> her husband. But he is too young. Also, they make two beds at night. He is maybe twenty years old. His eyes blue, his hair yellow, he has a little {{mustache}} which is yellow. His name is John Jones. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> her brother. I do not know. I ask questions no more. Only I think his name not John Jones. Other people call him Mr. Girvan. I {{do not think that}} is his name. I do not think her name is Miss Girvan, which other people call her. I think nobody know their names.|$|E
6000|$|... "We're {{all pretty}} well," [...] said Mrs. Rachel. [...] "I {{was kind of}} afraid YOU weren't, though, when I saw Matthew {{starting}} off today. I thought <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to the doctor's." ...|$|R
60|$|Or <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> Joe French. Or {{maybe one}} of the cops. Anyone of them might find himself moved to speak. And the few words spoken this day were going to be {{important}} for a long time.|$|R
50|$|He {{usually does}} things {{live in one}} take and is opposed to any over-dubbing. It just came about all of a sudden. I {{asked him to do}} it, and <b>he</b> said yes. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in a good mood that day.|$|R
6000|$|The {{white man}} has {{got into the}} way of [...] "{{carrying}}" [...] other people's burdens, and now {{it looks as if}} the yellow man were going to object to our carrying his any further. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> going to get nasty, and insist on carrying it himself. We call this [...] "the yellow danger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{we shall}} see," [...] was Valentina's answer. [...] "I like your counsel, Messer Francesco, and yet I see a certain wisdom in Gonzaga's words. Though {{in such a}} case as this I would sooner consort with folly than have a man's death upon my conscience. But here he comes, and, at least, we'll give him trial. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{penitent}} by now." ...|$|E
60|$|It is all done. Poor dear, dear Jonathan, what he {{must have}} suffered, {{what he must}} be {{suffering}} now. He lies on the sofa hardly seeming to breathe, and his whole body appears in collapse. His brows are knit. His face is drawn with pain. Poor fellow, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> thinking, and I can see his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his thoughts. Oh! if I could only help at all. I shall do what I can.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fixed him?" [...] Old Benson {{looked out}} upon the glade. [...] "By the great Jehosophat!" [...] he roared. [...] "Gone and shot a buffalo all by your lone selves! Or <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dead {{when you got}} here?" [...] he added suspiciously.|$|R
60|$|Rabecque <b>was</b> silent. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{ashamed of}} himself; or maybe that, not agreeing with his master, he had yet {{sufficient}} appreciation {{of his position}} to be discreetly silent where his opinions might be at variance. Thus Garnache was encouraged to continue.|$|R
2500|$|Dana {{describes}} Kevin: [...] "He was an unusual-looking white man, {{his face}} young, almost unlined, but his hair completely gray {{and his eyes}} so pale as to be almost colorless….I looked away startled, wondering whether I had really seen anger there. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{more important in the}} warehouse than I had thought. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> had some authority..." [...] (Kindred, p.54) ...|$|R
60|$|I could scarce refrain a grin when I {{thought of}} the wasted {{possibilities}} of that deadly revolver {{in the hands of}} an untutored warrior of the stone age. Had he but reversed it and pulled the trigger he might still be alive; <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> for all I know, since I did not kill him then. When he was about twenty feet from me I flung my javelin with a quick movement that I had learned from Ghak. He ducked to avoid it, and instead of receiving it in his heart, for which it was intended, he got it on the side of the head.|$|E
60|$|We {{have heard}} a {{discussion}} to-night on the disappearance of literature. That's no new thing. That's what certain kinds of literature have been doing for several years. The fact is, my friends, that the fashion in literature changes, and the literary tailors have to change their cuts or go out of business. Professor Winchester here, if I remember fairly correctly what he said, remarked that few, if any, of the novels produced to-day would live {{as long as the}} novels of Walter Scott. That may be his notion. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> right; but so far as I am concerned, I don't care if they don't.|$|E
60|$|He {{does not}} have to get up early and worry dumb-bells in his nightshirt; he just lies on a sofa in an elegant {{attitude}} and muscle comes to him. If his horse declines to jump a hedge, he slips down off the animal's back and throws the poor thing over; it saves argument. If he gets cross and puts his shoulder to the massive oaken door, we know {{there is going to be}} work next morning for the carpenter. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a party belonging to the Middle Ages. Then when he reluctantly challenges the crack fencer of Europe to a duel, our instinct is to call out and warn his opponent.|$|E
6000|$|... "If Jimmy has fixed their stands right, it's {{possible}} he shot Douglas and he reckons he did so. That's something; {{but he has}} a kind o' notion he heard another shot. Weel, the lad's a tenderfoot. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> excited and did not hold straight." ...|$|R
6000|$|Jephson {{appeared}} much {{surprised by}} this story. He remained thoughtful and silent. I {{asked him if he}} would like to hear any more, and as he offered no active opposition I went on. (<b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> asleep; that idea did not occur to me at the time.) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> born in Genoa and <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{a fellow}} sailor of {{explorer}} Giovanni da Verrazzano. Some historians {{say that he}} died of malaria in 1530; but archival documents show that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> still alive, in Genoa, at least in 1549, although <b>he</b> certainly <b>was</b> already dead in 1561 (Astengo, 2007, p. 72).|$|R
6000|$|The black recollected {{the hint}} about Santa Claus; and, while he briefly {{explained}} {{how they had}} taken up the person in question {{on the top of}} the mountain, he forbore to add anything concerning the accident or the wound, only saying that he believed the youth was a stranger. It was so usual for men of the first rank to take into their sleighs any one they found toiling through the snow, that Richard was perfectly satisfied with this explanation. He heard Aggy with great attention, and then remarked: “Well, if the lad has not been spoiled by the people in Templeton he may be a modest young man, and, as he certainly meant well, I shall take some notice of him— perhaps he is land-hunting—I say, Aggy, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> out hunting?” ...|$|E
6000|$|Of {{the four}} it was Carl {{who seemed to}} have the {{greatest}} interest in religions. He blurted out such monologues as, [...] "I wonder if it isn't pure egotism that makes a person believe that the religion he is born to is the best? My country, my religion, my wife, my business--we think that whatever is ours is necessarily sacred, or, in other words, that we are gods--and then we call it faith and patriotism! The Hindu or the Christian is equally ready to prove to you--and mind you, he may be a wise old man with a beard--that his national religion is obviously the only one. Find out what you yourself really do think, and if you turn out a Sun-worshiper or a Hard-shell Baptist, why, good luck. If you don't think for yourself, then you're admitting that your theory of happiness is the old dog asleep in the sun. And <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> happier than the student. But I think you like to experiment with life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen, man," [...] says I to him. [...] "Daniel Tobin is as {{sensible}} as he ever was. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a bit deranged {{on account}} of having drink enough to disturb {{but not enough to}} settle his wits, but he is no more than following out the legitimate path of his superstitions and predicaments, which I will explain to you." [...] With that I relates the facts about the palmist lady and how the finger of suspicion points to him as an instrument of good fortune. [...] "Now, understand," [...] I concludes, [...] "my position in this riot. I am the friend of me friend Tobin, according to me interpretations. 'Tis easy to be a friend to the prosperous, for it pays; 'tis not hard to be a friend to the poor, for ye get puffed up by gratitude and have your picture printed {{standing in front of a}} tenement with a scuttle of coal and an orphan in each hand. But it strains the art of friendship to be true friend to a born fool. And that's what I'm doing," [...] says I, [...] "for, in my opinion, there's no fortune to be read from the palm of me hand that wasn't printed there with the handle of a pick. And, though ye've got the crookedest nose in New York City, I misdoubt that all the fortune-tellers doing business could milk good luck from ye. But the lines of Danny's hand pointed to ye fair, and I'll assist him to experiment with ye until he's convinced ye're dry." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> born at Porto, Kingdom of Portugal, {{but nothing}} is known of his life until he entered the service of Isabella I of Castile in 1489. His surname is of Castilian origin, and <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born to Castilian immigrants, or descendants, {{established}} in Porto. But Castilians regarded him as Portuguese.|$|R
60|$|Paul Ruttledge. Yes, I remember. I {{have seen}} them coming home there on a windy evening, tossing and {{whirling}} like the sea. They may have seen what I am looking for, they fly so far. A sailor {{told me once that}} he saw a crow three hundred miles from land, but <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a liar.|$|R
60|$|What {{could have}} been Dick's object in telling such a lie? It made me wonder. Perhaps these lumbermen were more {{dangerous}} than I had supposed, and Dick did not wish them to believe I had left Penetier. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> playing for time, {{and did not want}} them to get alarmed and escape before the officers came.|$|R
