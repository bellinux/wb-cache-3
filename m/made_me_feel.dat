5|$|I have then {{considered}} {{myself as}} a particle broken off from the grand mass of mankind; — I was alone, till some involuntary sympathetic emotion, like the attraction of adhesion, <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> that I was still {{a part of a}} mighty whole, from which I could not sever myself—not, perhaps, for the reflection has been carried very far, by snapping the thread of an existence which loses its charms in proportion as the cruel experience of life stops or poisons the current of the heart.|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} {{initially}} titled Britney and Kevin: Can You Handle Our Truth?, before its title {{was changed to}} Britney and Kevin: Chaotic, with [...] "Can you handle our truth?" [...] becoming its tagline. All of the footage shot for OnTourage was used for Britney and Kevin: Chaotic. According to Spears, the series helped the couple {{to know each other}} more, saying: [...] "I didn't know [...] that well, and when I got the camera out, it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> better. It's really weird because it was like all this tension at first. We were so nervous being together. I'm really shy, and when I had the camera in my hand, it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> more outspoken." ...|$|E
500|$|Drake then {{contacted}} Songz, who {{had been}} working with Drake back since 2007 on mixtapes. Songz said that Drake originally called him on advice of segueing his singing into rapping on interludes, then the terms of what records he would be featured on the mixtape, as he sent him the [...] "Successful" [...] track. After Drake still could not settle on the direction for the track, Songz came up with the his hook. He explained to MTV News, [...] "The first thing that came to mind was 'I want the money, money and the cars/ Cars and the clothes/ The ho's/ I suppose I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful.' When I'm saying all that, conceptually for me, the deepest part of the record was when I say, 'I suppose.' I supposed that's what success is about. That's what [...] led to believe." [...] After hearing the hook, Drake called it [...] "powerful", commenting, [...] "And it's like, it's almost like it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> like it may not be right what I want, you know? All these things, it's like it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> young. It kind of <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> ignorant to the game. But it was an exciting record even though the tempo is slow. That's what I want... The 'I suppose' moment in there is like, it's almost like you're doubting yourself for a second. But {{at the end of the}} day, I just want to be successful. So that's what the record meant to me." ...|$|E

6000|$|Still, I did not, I could not, conceal {{from her}} that she had given me great pain, and she replied in a tone which really <b>made</b> <b>me</b> almost <b>feel</b> ungrateful for being pained, she said 'rather that her whole book had perished than have given me a moment's pain.' How are you to feel after that? ...|$|R
500|$|I was {{surprised}} by how people reacted to [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] because when I did that song, to me, I was singing about how something <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> a certain way—brand-new and fresh—and everyone interpreted it as I don't {{want to be a}} virgin anymore. Fuck my brains out! That's not what I sang at all. [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] was always absolutely ambiguous.|$|E
500|$|John Masefield, {{who knew}} Synge, {{wrote that he}} [...] "gave one from the first the {{impression}} of a strange personality". Masefield felt that Synge's view of life originated with his poor health.

6000|$|My heart gave a great bound, {{and then}} seemed to swell {{and take away}} my breath, so that I could not at first speak to stop those uttered thoughts, which <b>made</b> <b>me</b> {{presently}} <b>feel</b> as if I were prying into a letter, {{so as soon as}} I could get my voice I said, as well as I could, 'My Lady, I hear you.' ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{entering}} the NFL's substance abuse program, Soward was critical about its effectiveness. [...] "It was horrible counseling. I’ve been in every rehab centre known to man," [...] said Soward. [...] "They {{even had the}} nerve to put me in rehab in Miami, the drug capital of the world. I don’t really think the rehabilitation process is very good for players down there. I think it is more of a disciplinary kind of rehabilitation which doesn’t teach anybody anything. For me, the more they took away from me the more it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> want to drink, the more it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> want to <b>feel</b> depressed, the more it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> want to <b>feel</b> bad about me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Hilda cut {{her short}} with a sunny smile--half contemptuous toleration, half genuine pity. [...] "We are all ungrateful," [...] she said; [...] "but the poor, I think, the least so. I'm sure the {{gratitude}} I've often had from my poor women at St. Nathaniel's has <b>made</b> <b>me</b> sometimes <b>feel</b> really ashamed of myself. I {{had done so}} little--and they thanked me so much for it." ...|$|R
500|$|Like Chapman, Schaefer {{is a fan}} of both The Beatles and J.D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, {{and said}} he began the script to try to {{understand}} [...] "how someone could be inspired to kill anyone as a result of being exposed to this kind of beautiful art. It really bothered me, because Lennon and Salinger have always <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> so much better, and so much less alone." ...|$|E
500|$|Guitarist Jimi Hendrix, {{performing}} with The Jimi Hendrix Experience, recorded a live version at the Monterey Pop Festival. Hendrix {{was an avid}} fan of Bob Dylan, and especially liked [...] "Like a Rolling Stone". [...] "It <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> that I wasn't the only one who'd ever felt so low..." [...] Hendrix said. After the second verse, Hendrix skipped to the fourth. Hendrix played the electric guitar, and music critic Greil Marcus described {{the atmosphere of the}} Hendrix recording thus: ...|$|E
500|$|Reid {{started his}} career with the Nottingham Forest youth academy, after joining from Cherry Orchard. Reid said [...] "I chose Forest years ago because they <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> wanted, because they had more time for me as a young kid than I felt at Arsenal or United". He turned {{professional}} in August 1999, making made his debut on 29 November 2000 against Sheffield United. In the 2001–02 season Reid failed to score a goal, although he played in 31 games.|$|E
60|$|As Screw obeyed I saw a look pass {{between him}} and the two strangers which <b>made</b> <b>me</b> begin to <b>feel</b> a little uneasy. I thought the doctor noticed it too; but he {{preserved}} his countenance, as usual, in a state of the most unruffled composure.|$|R
6000|$|... “Nothing {{can escape}} his penetration,” Blunt remarked {{to me with}} that equivocal urbanity which <b>made</b> <b>me</b> always <b>feel</b> uncomfortable on Mills’ account. “Positively nothing.” He turned to Mills again. “After some minutes of immobility—she told me—she arose from her stone and walked slowly on the track of that apparition. Allègre {{was nowhere to be}} seen by that time. Under the gateway of the {{extremely}} ugly tenement house, which hides the Pavilion and the garden from the street, the wife of the porter was waiting with her arms akimbo. At once she cried out to Rita: ‘You were caught by our gentleman.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{looked at}} her so hard with it that her colour began to rise, which <b>made</b> <b>me</b> {{promptly}} <b>feel</b> that she wouldn't press that point. [...] "I mean you're carried away--you're abused by a fine fancy: so that, with your art of putting things, one doesn't know where one is--nor, if you'll allow me to say so, do I quite think you always do. Of course I don't deny you're awfully clever. But you build up," [...] she brought out with a regret so indulgent and a reluctance so marked that she for some seconds fairly held the blow--"you build up houses of cards." ...|$|R
500|$|Ferreira {{stated that}} the lyrics for [...] "Red Lips" [...] were {{intended}} as a narrative of the emotional breakdown of [...] "a very specific person or a type [...] always <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> uncomfortable". In October 2012, DJ Com Truise released a synthpop remix of [...] "Red Lips", which a writer for Fact felt complimented the songs on his debut studio album Galactic Melt (2011).

500|$|... "I {{tried to}} put {{different}} things in the video that <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> under pressure and it really did! It was the hardest video I`ve ever done so I kept thinking, why on earth did I {{come up with this}} concept? People don’t realise but I definitely have that Australian tomboy side to me. I love snakes and sharks and jumping out of planes and stuff. Growing up {{it never occurred to me}} that it wasn’t a girly thing to ride a bike, covered in mud holding frogs and collecting lizards!".|$|E
500|$|At school, Ripley enjoyed drama lessons, {{spurred on by}} the {{positive}} remarks she received from her drama teacher Susan Ford. She said of Ford, [...] "When I was 15, {{one of the few}} people who said, 'Well done', was my drama teacher, and she was really brilliant. She was a powerful woman. Those women change your life. You always remember them. There was something about her. She basically <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> very good about myself as a 15-year-old girl." [...] Abandoning her childhood ambition to become a nurse, Ripley decided to go into acting.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I an't what I could wish {{myself to}} be,' said Mrs. Gummidge. 'I am far from it. I know what I am. My {{troubles}} has <b>made</b> <b>me</b> contrary.

5000|$|The newly {{released}} [...] "I Don’t Wanna Be In Love", featured in {{an episode of}} Vampire Diaries, hit #2 on the Hype Machine’s most popular chart. [...] "I wrote this song {{toward the end of}} a relationship," [...] says Long. [...] "I didn't realize how weighed down I felt until after it ended, but I knew something wasn't right. It <b>made</b> <b>me</b> sad to <b>feel</b> disconnected from someone that I once felt so close to. The song is basically me taking a look at my situation and being honest with myself about how I felt." ...|$|R
6000|$|From {{seven years}} of age to this very hour, I have been {{dependent}} only on my own head and hands for everything--for very bread. Long years ago--ay, even in childhood--adversity <b>made</b> <b>me</b> think, and <b>feel,</b> and suffer; and would pride allow me, I could tell the world many a deep tragedy enacted {{in the heart of}} a poor, forgotten, uncared-for boy [...] . But I thank God, that though I felt and suffered, the scathing blast neither blunted my perceptions of natural and moral beauty, nor, by withering the affections of my heart, <b>made</b> <b>me</b> a selfish man. Often when I look back I wonder how I bore the burden--how I did not end the evil day at once and for ever.|$|R
500|$|.....it's {{encouraging}} {{to win a}} prize. But the success of Tirra Lirra, plus the prize it won and the two prizes The Impersonators won, <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> less private and more vulnerable, and I had to get over {{that in order to}} go on at all. I had never been interviewed before, or I had never been asked to be interviewed, and suddenly I had all these interviews. It was a challenge I found hard to meet. I almost wished I had kept writing under a pseudonym as I had begun… ...|$|E
500|$|A year later, Frusciante and {{his mother}} moved to Mar Vista, Los Angeles with his new {{stepfather}} who, he says, [...] "really supported me and <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> good about being an artist." [...] Like many {{young people in the}} area, he became intimately involved in the L.A. punk rock scene. At nine he was infatuated with the Germs, wearing out several copies of their record (GI). By ten, he had taught himself how to play most of (GI)'s songs. He has stated that he did not really know what he was doing, and that he would play every chord with a single-finger barre.|$|E
500|$|Murphy called [...] "Wheels" [...] "the {{turning point}} for the show". He elaborated: [...] "Certainly, after this, it remains a comedy, and it's fun. But writing this <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> the {{responsibility}} of showing {{the truth of the}} pain that outcasts go through. It's not all razzle-dazzle show business. It's tough, and it's painful, and it was for me growing up, and it is for most people." [...] Murphy commented that the episode caused him to realize that, as well as highlighting the [...] "fun and glamour" [...] of glee clubs, it is also occasionally [...] "really great [...] to show the underbelly of what people who are different feel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dear," [...] cried Harriet, [...] "now I {{recollect}} {{what you}} mean; but I {{was thinking of}} something very different at the time. It was not the gipsies--it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant. No! (with some elevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance--of Mr. Knightley's coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton would not stand up with me; and {{when there was no}} other partner in the room. That was the kind action; that was the noble benevolence and generosity; that was the service which <b>made</b> <b>me</b> begin to <b>feel</b> how superior he was to every other being upon earth." ...|$|R

5000|$|Owen Gleiberman {{wrote in}} Variety, [...] "At {{three hours and}} 58 minutes, it has the sprawl and {{generosity}} of a good Dead show, yet there’s nothing indulgent about it - it's an ardent piece of documentary classicism.... Deadheads will drink it in and debate it, poring over every detail it works in and leaves out, yet the ultimate recommendation I can give the movie is this: I'm {{one of those people}} who can't stand the Grateful Dead... yet I found Long Strange Trip enthralling. For the first time, it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> see, and <b>feel,</b> and understand the slovenly glory of what they were up to, even if my ears still process their music as monotonous roots-rock wallpaper." ...|$|R
500|$|... "I {{listened to}} it on my crappy {{computer}} speakers and then I had to go find my headphones because as soon as I listened to a few bars, I had to listen more closely and I got chills. I remember where I was when I heard it and called my manager, Ann, and I was like, 'Do not let anyone else have this song! It’s my song.' In talking to Chris and Josh about it, they , 'We said we're either writing a song for Carrie Underwood or this song {{is never going to}} see the light of day.' It <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> so good that they were thinking of me when they wrote it." ...|$|E
500|$|Erik Adams of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "C+" [...] {{and felt that}} the finale scene, while set up to be emotional, was [...] "hollow". He argued that the tension does not feel as {{threatening}} as it should; he compared it to the second season episode [...] "Casino Night", which had invoked real fears {{about the future of}} Jim and Pam. He summed up: [...] "I wish the final scene of 'Paper Airplane' <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> something deeper." [...] Adams also was not impressed with the Dwight-Angela storyline, but was [...] "enjoying Andy's day on the industrial-safety film—much more so than [...] anticipated" [...] due to the [...] "unintentional hilarity" [...] that ensued.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the track}} {{was a major}} hit for the band, Dave Davies did not enjoy the success of [...] "Lola", saying, [...] "In fact, when 'Lola' was a hit, it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> a bit uncomfortable. Because it was taking us out of a {{different}} sort of comfort zone, where we'd been getting into the work, and the writing and the musicality was more thought about. It did have that smell of: 'Oh blimey, not that again.' I found it a bit odd, that period. And then it got odder and weirder". Mick Avory said that he [...] "enjoyed the success" [...] the band had with [...] "Lola" [...] and its follow-up, [...] "Apeman".|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Sebright {{dismissed}} Zillah with a frigid inclination of the head. His discouraging manner <b>made</b> <b>me</b> {{begin to}} <b>feel</b> a little uneasy. I ventured {{to ask if}} he had arrived at a conclusion yet. [...] "Permit me to consult with my colleague before I answer you," [...] said the impenetrable man. I roused Lucilla. She again inquired for Oscar. I said I supposed we should find him in the garden--and so took her out. Nugent followed us. I heard Herr Grosse whisper to him piteously, as we passed the luncheon-table, [...] "For the lofe of Heaven, come back soon, and let us lonch!" [...] We left the ill-assorted pair to their consultation in the sitting-room.|$|R
60|$|The {{objections}} and reluctances I {{met with}} in soliciting the subscriptions, <b>made</b> <b>me</b> soon <b>feel</b> the impropriety of presenting one's self as the proposer of any useful project {{that might be}} supposed to raise one's reputation in the smallest degree above that of one's neighbours, when one has need of their assistance to accomplish that project. I therefore put myself as much as I could out of sight, and stated it as a scheme {{of a number of}} friends, who had requested me to go about and propose it to such as they thought lovers of reading. In this way my affairs went on more smoothly, and I ever after practised it on such occasions, and from my frequent successes can heartily recommend it. The present little sacrifice of your vanity will afterward be amply repaid. If it remains a while uncertain to whom the merit belongs, some one more vain than yourself will be encouraged to claim it, and then even envy will be disposed to do you justice, by plucking those assumed feathers and restoring them to their right owner.|$|R
