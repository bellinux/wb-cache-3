40|$|Serial {{communication}} {{is commonly used}} in PC interface, but serial communication that commonly used is RS- 232 which only can communicate in one to one. In this final project design a RS- 232 to RS- 485 converter which in the RS- 485 system can communicate in one to many using a <b>multidrop</b> <b>network</b> system. An Application {{in order to use}} this converter is monitoring a computer, so that ini one computer we can see what they doing in the order computer by looking in that monitor. Software designed under Windows (32 bit) using Delphi 3. 0 from Borland International, Inc Software. There is two kind software which one is a master that use to control which computer we want to see while the other one is slave that use to send the picture in the other computer which stay resident and active. For hardware it made 3 RS 232 to RS 485 converter that installed at the 3 PC which one used for master and 2 PC for slave. Testing in the hardware is by iooking at the signal input from the PC and input-output signal from the IC that used in the converter, testing in the software is the truth of sending data, picture compression, and the speed of transmission. From the data gained shows that the errer is 1 % in transmission data and the speed of transmission...|$|E
