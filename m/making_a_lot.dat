5|$|After {{the first}} game's {{development}} was finished, Mikami told Takumi {{that they should}} make an Ace Attorney trilogy, with a grand finale in the third game's last case. Takumi had originally planned to let Edgeworth be the prosecutor in all episodes in the second game, but during the production the development team learned that the character had become popular. This led to Takumi feeling {{that he had to}} use the character more carefully and sparingly; he created the new prosecutor character Franziska von Karma, to save Edgeworth for the game's last case, and avoid a situation where he – a supposed prodigy – loses every case. As Takumi wanted the three first Ace Attorney games to be parts of a larger work, he avoided <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of changes between games: art from the first game for main characters such as Phoenix, Maya and Edgeworth was reused, to avoid having the previous games look outdated in comparison to newer games in the series; and no new gameplay mechanics were added for Trials and Tribulations, as Takumi was happy with the gameplay after having added the psyche-lock mechanic for Justice for All.|$|E

But {{that was the last}} of his 18 centuries and after a few matches in 1927, he retired.|$|E

25|$|Irvine did {{not play}} Test cricket again and in fact never played cricket outside the {{domestic}} South African competitions after this brief taste of Test cricket. The South Africans had been due to tour England in 1970, but the tour was called off, and though other players, such as Barry Richards and Mike Procter returned to their English counties for the season, Irvine did {{not go back to}} Essex. He played regularly for Transvaal for the next seven seasons, <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of runs and also acting as the regular wicketkeeper for the first five years.

25|$|It {{was both}} {{necessity}} {{and the prospect}} of <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of money that gave birth to the steam-powered grain elevator in Buffalo, New York, in 1843. Due to the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825, Buffalo enjoyed a unique position in American geography. It stood at the intersection of two great all-water routes: one extending from New York Harbor, up the Hudson River, to Albany and, beyond it, the Port of Buffalo; the other constituted by the Great Lakes, which could theoretically take boaters in any direction they wished to go (north to Canada, west to Michigan or Wisconsin, south to Toledo and Cleveland, or east to the Atlantic Ocean). All through the 1830s, Buffalo benefited tremendously from its position. In particular, it was the recipient of most of the increasing quantities of grain (mostly wheat) that was being grown on farms in Ohio and Indiana, and shipped on Lake Erie for transshipment to the Erie Canal. If Buffalo hadn't been there, or when things got backed up there, that grain would have been loaded onto boats at Cincinnati and shipped down the Mississippi River to New Orleans.|$|E
25|$|Result: Odyssey {{decided on}} a 1940s theme at a premium price, while Platinum went with a theme based around Alice in Wonderland and the Mad Hatter's tea party, and much cheaper pricing. Things {{generally}} went smoothly on Odyssey, {{though there was a}} major argument between Alice and Maria over the pricing, as Alice wanted to offer discounts for senior citizens, while Maria felt everyone should pay full price. They struggled to attract customers as the day went on, and had to resort to slashing prices as the task drew to a close. Despite the price cutting, it only managed to pull in 2 extra customers. On Platinum, David had trouble effectively leading the team, which resulted in Ashleigh <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the decisions: on the second day, their tea service rapidly descended into chaos, with David still struggling to lead the team, and customers failing to be served in a timely manner. However, the service smoothed out as the day progressed and they took over £100 more than Odyssey. Despite their better overall execution of the task, Odyssey spent £100 more money, which proved decisive in the end figures. Odyssey had a profit of £91, and Platinum had a profit of £316, more than 3 times the amount of Odyssey.|$|E

The effort had been perfect up to that point, and Sánchez went on to retire each of the remaining five batters, meaning this error lost the first perfect game since Randy Johnson 's in 2004. This was the first no-hit, no-walk, no–hit batsman game that was not also a perfect game since Terry Mulholland's no-hitter in 1990.

Before sinking, Mesudiye spotted B11 and fired on her periscope which revealed her position to the shore batteries. Attempting to leave the area, B11 briefly grounded herself, breaking the surface, but was able to get herself off. B11s compass became fogged and prevented the submarine from navigating at depth; instead Holbrook had to [...] the boat at periscope depth which meant he had to go through the minefields, not below them. Nevertheless, the boat made it back safely; Holbrook was awarded the Victoria Cross, his First Lieutenant, the Distinguished Service Order and every enlisted man the Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E

She is {{convinced}} {{that it must have}} been an accident, but the Saudi law is unforgiving and Amir is scheduled to be executed. An Indian officer explains to her that Saudi law permits release of a criminal if the wife of the deceased forgives the guilt. Armed only with a photograph of Shankar and Amir, Zeenat sets out to find Meera. On route, she meets a Behrupiya (Shreyas Talpade).
