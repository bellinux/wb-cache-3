25|$|Cmdre. Felix M. Apolinario, PN {{was born}} on 2 May 1918 in Santa Cruz, Manila. Poling earned the moniker “verbatim” during his senior year, because of his studiousness. After graduation, he joined the OSP, saw action in Bataan as ground support for the 1st Q-Boat Sqdn and beach defense in Lamao. After Bataan fell, he became a POW, was interned in Capas and {{released}} as a sick POW in August 1942. After the war he reported to military control and helped rebuild a new OSP that later became the Philippine Navy. He held various positions that culminated in his becoming FOIC, PN in 1965, a post he held up to his retirement in June 1966. After retirement, Poling established a company dealing with <b>marine</b> <b>electronics,</b> life saving equipment, airplane parts, firefighting and audio equipment. Eleng was also a devoted golfer and played the game as a hobby for many years. He died in July 1999 at age 81.|$|E
25|$|In 1945, {{the company}} {{expanded}} its electronics capability through acquisitions {{that included the}} Submarine Signal Company (founded in 1901), a leading manufacturer of maritime safety equipment. With its broadened capabilities, Raytheon developed the first guidance system for a missile that could intercept a flying target. In 1948, Raytheon began to manufacture guided missiles. In 1950, its Lark missile became the first such weapon to destroy a target aircraft in flight. Raytheon then received military contracts to develop the air-to-air Sparrow and ground-to-air Hawk missiles—projects that received impetus from the Korean War. In later decades, it remained a major producer of missiles, among them the Patriot antimissile missile and the air-to-air Phoenix missile. In 1959, Raytheon acquired the <b>marine</b> <b>electronics</b> company Apelco Applied Electronics, which significantly increased its strength in commercial marine navigation and radio gear, as well as less-expensive Japanese suppliers of products such as marine/weather band radios and direction-finding gear. In the same year, it {{changed its name to}} Raytheon Company.|$|E

50|$|Shaw's first rebreather was an Inspiration {{closed circuit}} rebreather, which he {{eventually}} dived to depths beyond the unit's supposed capability. That {{prompted him to}} purchase a Mk15.5, which he modified by removing the analogue electronics and replacing them with the Juergensen <b>Marine</b> Hammerhead digital <b>electronics,</b> in a specially modified POD designed to handle extreme pressures. The Mk15.5 was his rebreather of choice for dives deeper than 150 m. Shaw also owned a Cis-Lunar Mk5P that he used on extended dives in caves shallower than 150 m. He believed the Cis-Lunar had greater redundancy capabilities for such dives but could not cope with extreme depths.|$|R
