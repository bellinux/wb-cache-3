40|$|International audienceSolar arrays are {{structures}} {{which are}} connected to satellites; during launch, {{they are in a}} folded position and submitted to high vibrations. In order to save mass, the flexibility of the panels is not negligible and they may strike each other; this may damage the structure. To prevent this, rubber snubbers are mounted at well chosen points of the structure; a prestress is applied to the snubber; but it is quite difficult to check the amount of prestress and the snubber may act only on one side; they will be modeled as one sided springs (see figure 2). In this article, some analysis for responses (displacements) in both time and frequency domains for a clamped-clamped Euler-Bernoulli beam model with a spring are presented. This spring can be unilateral or bilateral fixed at a point. The <b>mounting</b> (<b>beam</b> +spring) is fixed on a rigid support which has a sinusoidal motion of constant frequency. The system is also studied in the frequency domain by sweeping frequencies between two fixed values, in order to save the maximum of displacements corresponding to each frequency. Numerical results are compared with exact solutions in particular cases which already exist in the literature. On the other hand, a numerical and theoretical investigation of nonlinear normal mode (NNM) can be a new method to describe nonlinear behaviors, this work is in progress...|$|E

40|$|During {{the summer}} of 2014 {{there was a major}} forest fire in Västmanland. In the area {{affected}} by the fire the highest priority was to save the remaining timber and simultaneously start planning for the future regeneration. This documentation has been carried out in cooperation with AB Karl Hedin. The purpose of this project was to document the regeneration that has been performed during {{the summer of}} 2015 at AB Karl Hedin’s section of the burned- over area. Approximately 500 hectares were regenerated during the 2015 season and the regeneration methods used were manual and mechanized sowing, planting and scarification under seed trees. Scarification with a front <b>mounted</b> <b>beam</b> on a forwarder was used in cases with large amounts of remaining residues. The major threats to the regeneration is the pine weevil and pine fire fungus. The regeneration of the fire area will be carried out over three years...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the use of triangularly shaped actuators for the implementation of direct velocity feedback (DVFB) control on a resiliently <b>mounted</b> <b>beam.</b> The effects on the stability is investigated of boundary conditions and the shape of the actuator. For practical boundary conditions, with a combination of the rotational and linear springs, it is found that the linear spring is the principal component affecting the stability and thus the control performance. The stiffness of this spring has to be high enough to approximate a simply supported boundary condition for good performance. The amplitude of the sensor-actuator frequency response function increases as the top angle and the height of the triangular actuator is increased so that control effort can be saved. However, as the height of the actuator is increased, the stability margin reduces. Therefore, for the given beam there is an actuator shape that gives the best compromise between the stability and control effort. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the problem of}} attenuating the vibration at a certain location on a flexible cantilevered <b>beam</b> <b>mounted</b> on a vibrating base which is the tip in this case. Attenuation is achieved {{without the need for}} sensor placement at that location. A modal state-space model of the flexible beam is constructed from the beam’s first ten modes of vibration. A reduced-order optimal observer is utilized to estimate the deflection of the beam’s tip from measurements of vertical deflections at mid-span and actuator locations. An inertial actuator is <b>mounted</b> on the <b>beam</b> itself, provides the control effort necessary for attenuating the tip vibration, resulting from shaker excitation. Experimental and simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed control technique...|$|R
