2500|$|Hellman shot {{almost the}} entire script as written. The first cut of the film was three-and-a-half hours long. He was his own editor: [...] "I can't look over someone's shoulder. I need <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> brake". He had control of the final cut, but was contractually obliged to deliver a film no longer than two hours. The final version ran 105 minutes. In their April 1971 cover story, Esquire {{magazine}} proclaimed Two-Lane Blacktop, [...] "film of the year". Hellman initially thought that the Esquire article would be good publicity for the film, but in hindsight was not, because [...] "I think it raised people's expectations. They couldn't accept the movie for what it was". There {{was a lot of}} advance buzz about the film, but Lew Wasserman, head of the studio saw the film and hated it. He refused to promote it and when it opened in New York City on the Fourth of July weekend, there were no newspaper ads promoting it.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 February 2010, Tebbit was {{alleged to}} have {{attacked}} a ceremonial Chinese dragon during a Chinese New Year parade. He {{is said to have}} been unaware it was Chinese New Year and to have [...] "kicked the rear of a child who was dressed in the traditional costume of a dragon". Tebbit later said: [...] "I don't think my reaction was extreme at all. I placed <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> drum so I could diminish the noise and asked the drummer what was going on and got a rap on the knuckles for my pain. I was then barged by the dragon. I barged it back and might have done something like kick it. I wasn't sure how to deal with it. I've never been barged by a dragon before". A local Conservative town councillor, Mr Chung, visited Tebbit the day after the incident and received an apology. Chung said: [...] "I said his actions were upsetting. He apologised. He only then understood what he had done".|$|E

6000|$|... "Well rid of it," [...] he growled. [...] "It {{never did}} set properly. I was always aching to get <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sail-maker that made it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, that's bright work," [...] he acknowledged. [...] "I believe I {{could have}} laid <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> man, {{but it was}} the jewels that I was afraid of losing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The wallet {{contained}} {{my entire}} fortune," [...] rejoined Sue calmly, [...] "all that Master Skyffington had placed in <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> day that <b>my</b> father willed {{that it should}} be given me." ...|$|R
60|$|I didn't care. I shouted. I came down, with a smack of <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{opposite}} side of the table.|$|E
60|$|I rested <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> low wall {{in front}} of the house, and made a desperate effort to put a calm face on it.|$|E
60|$|As I {{ceased to}} speak, {{he made a}} step towards me. I drew back instinctively, and laid <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hilt of my sword.|$|E
60|$|I placed <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{top rail}} and sprang up to vault over. As my head bent over, my eyes {{caught sight of}} an object lying in the hole of the fence post.|$|R
6000|$|... "As I've said--all I {{could lay}} <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on.</b> <b>The</b> old boy'll think {{the end of}} the world has come." [...] Razumov nodded from the couch, and {{contemplated}} the hare-brained fellow's gravity with a feeling of malicious pleasure.|$|R
60|$|The clock {{struck the}} quarter after one, when I laid <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> window-sill of <b>my</b> own room. I had seen nothing and heard nothing {{which could lead}} me to suppose that my retreat had been discovered.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sabina Mellot, and a Sultana--I {{thought her}} of The Nation, {{and would have}} offered <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spot: but Madame Mellot says she is a Gentile." ...|$|E
6000|$|My {{heart beat}} fast--I thought I had <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> clue. How little I knew {{then of the}} {{windings}} of the labyrinths which were still to mislead me! ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{only other}} shock I had was when Miss Trelawny cried out to me, as I placed <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bed to lean over and look {{carefully}} at her father: ...|$|E
6000|$|I HAVE {{opened the}} window to warm <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> [...] sill Where the {{sunlight}} soaks in the stone: the afternoon Is full of dreams, my love, the boys are all still In a wistful dream of Lorna Doone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me lay <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> villains who tied me fast in that {{stable and}} I shall teach them a lesson {{they will not}} forget in a hurry," [...] said he, bitterly. [...] "They made a fool of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it so, Baas?" [...] {{answered}} Otter with a hiccough. [...] "Well, {{they were}} a poor lot, and we shall not miss them. And yet I wish I were a man again and had <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> throat of that wizard Nam. Wow! but I would squeeze it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{give you}} my word, that will be as strong a bond {{to me as if}} I laid <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Bible. I don't require that to bind me." ...|$|E
60|$|A wild look {{raised his}} brows--crossed his features: he rose; but he forebore yet. I laid <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{back of a}} chair for support: I shook, I feared--but I resolved.|$|E
60|$|I laid <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> footman's shoulder, not {{understanding}} what Charles meant. Dudley, terrified, drew back, {{and would have}} rushed from the room; but Charles, with {{his back against the}} door, prevented him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Cut {{off another}} piece of rope, and give it me. When {{we are in the}} water, I will fasten you to the oars. They will keep you afloat, easily enough. I will keep close to you. You know I am a good swimmer and, {{whenever}} I feel tired, I can rest <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> oars, too.|$|R
60|$|Thus {{ended the}} fictitious-name business. And not six hours out from St. Louis! but I had gained a privilege, any way, for I had been itching to get <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wheel, from the beginning. I {{seemed to have}} {{forgotten}} the river, but I hadn't forgotten how to steer a steamboat, nor how to enjoy it, either.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hark ye, friend," [...] he whispered. [...] "Never let Frank know it. There was a {{time when}} the fiend within me hungered for his life. I had <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> boat. I heard the voice of the Tempter {{speaking}} to me: Launch it, and leave him to die! I waited with <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> boat, and <b>my</b> eyes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> place where he slept. 'Leave him! leave him!' the voice whispered. 'Love him!' the lad's voice answered, moaning and murmuring in his sleep. 'Love him, Clara, for helping me!' I heard the morning wind come up in the silence over the great deep. Far and near, I heard the groaning of the floating ice; floating, floating to the clear water and the balmy air. And the wicked Voice floated away with it--away, away, away forever! 'Love him! love him, Clara, for helping me!' No wind could float that away! 'Love him, Clara--'" ...|$|R
6000|$|I paused with <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door--the {{voice was}} {{familiar}} to me. I had a moment's doubt whether I was mad or dreaming. The voice softly repeated, [...] "Come in!" [...] I entered the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{give you}} my word not to meet him or write to him again without your knowledge. That {{is the only thing}} I will say. I will put <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Bible if you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But {{you shall}} have some breakfast!' said I, with <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bell-rope, 'and Mrs. Crupp shall make you some fresh coffee, and I'll toast you some bacon in a bachelor's Dutch-oven, that I have got here.' ...|$|E
60|$|Just as <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door, {{she caught}} fast {{hold of my}} dress and stopped me.|$|R
5000|$|Discussing {{his love}} for {{automotive}} engineering: [...] "I just {{fell in love with}} that machinery. I still love it. Love to see it change from lines on paper to finished form. All the time I was Chief Engineer, I couldn't wait to get <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first prototype of a new car. I'd look for excuses to go out there in the shops and look at cars. I still do." ...|$|R
60|$|During {{the greater}} part of this harangue <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lock of the outer door; I now turned it.|$|R
6000|$|... "'A minute, madam,' I said, keeping <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door-handle before I opened it. 'We {{have had}} a long {{conversation}} this morning, but the last word has not been spoken yet. It is yours to speak it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You needn't be so proud, Mr. Smith; I've had <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> arm of {{as good as}} you. Ah, you needn't start! I know you--I know you, I say, well enough. You used to be with him. Where is he?' ...|$|E
60|$|So {{she fell}} silent again, {{and to me}} it seemed that I must not any longer look upon that holy mystery, so, {{crossing}} myself, I laid <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shoulder of the page, and we went silently from the place.|$|E
5000|$|Although it {{was never}} {{released}} as a single, it is a popular live song. The song itself is built on a very simple chord progression featuring a repetitive drum pattern, Chuck Berry-like lead guitar from Richards, the piano of Jack Nitzsche, tambourine and organ pedals by multi-instrumentalist Jones, and bass by Wyman. Jagger, Jones, and Wyman later overdubbed handclaps. Jagger said in 1967, [...] "That's me beating <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bass drum." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm awfully sorry! But these debts {{have been}} so {{worrying}} me that they put lots of things out of my head. That bill to be paid on Monday, when I haven't a feather to fly with, is enough to drive a fellow off his chump. The moment I lay <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> letter I shall keep it with me so that I can't forget it again. Won't you forgive me for this time?' ...|$|R
60|$|I know I {{was rather}} confused, and that I had {{swallowed}} quite a deal of salt water, ere I got <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rungs {{of the ladder}} and {{climbed to the top}} of <b>the</b> house. <b>On</b> my way aft along the bridge I encountered the crew coming for'ard. Mr. Mellaire and Mr. Pike were talking in the lee of the chart-house, and inside, as I passed below, Captain West was smoking a cigar.|$|R
