5|$|Ant {{societies}} have division of labour, communication between individuals, {{and an ability}} to solve complex problems. These parallels with human {{societies have}} long been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, <b>medication,</b> <b>and</b> rituals. Some species are valued in their role as biological pest control agents. Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they can damage crops and invade buildings. Some species, such as the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), are regarded as invasive species, establishing themselves in areas where they have been introduced accidentally.|$|E

5|$|Countries with {{decades of}} {{experience}} in comprehensive emergency medical systems have expertise that nations that are just beginning emergency medical programs lack. Thus, there exists considerable opportunity for the transfer of knowledge to assist newly founded programs. Such transfers may be made either from a distance or in person. For instance, the International Emergency Medicine Fellowship at the University of Toronto sent a three-person team to Cluj-Napoca, Romania, to promote the local development of emergency medicine. An assessment of the present status was performed that identified targets for improvement in physical plant organization and patient flow; staffing, staff education, equipment, <b>medication</b> <b>and</b> supplies; and infection control practices. Following these designations, plans regarding these areas were collaboratively drawn up and then implemented, partially through international exchange trips.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} the effects of <b>medications</b> <b>and</b> systemic diseases on major salivary gland flow rates. Unstimulated and 2 % citrate-stimulated parotid and submandibular salivas were collected from 293 subjects of the oral physiology component of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. The influence of the number of <b>medications</b> <b>and</b> diseases on salivary flow rates was determined by separate one-way ANOVA tests. There was an overall decrease in both parotid and submandibular flow rates with increasing numbers of <b>medications</b> <b>and</b> systemic diseases. However, this was significant (p < 0. 05) only for unstimulated submandibular flow rates (with increasing numbers of systemic diseases) and stimulated submandibular flow rates (with increasing numbers of systemic diseases <b>and</b> <b>medications).</b> Unstimulated flow rates rapidly approached zero with increasing numbers of <b>medications</b> <b>and</b> diseases. These results suggest that the submandibular gland may be more sensitive to physiologic permutations than the parotid gland. In addition, individuals being treated for multiple systemic diseases <b>and</b> taking numerous <b>medications</b> may be more susceptible to salivary hypofunction...|$|R
