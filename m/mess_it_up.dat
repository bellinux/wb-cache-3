5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to <b>mess</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
500|$|Former Montreal Canadiens goaltender Ken Dryden {{described}} of Orr: [...] "When {{he began}} to move... the sensation was unique: All the Canadiens began backpedalling in a small panic, like beachgoers sighting a coming monster wave. He brought others with him; he wanted them involved. That's what made him so different: It felt like a five-player stampede moving toward you—and at his pace. He pushed his teammates, [...] you're playing with {{the best player in}} the league and he's giving you the puck and you just can't <b>mess</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> You had to be better than you'd ever been." ...|$|E
500|$|Maginnis {{describes}} {{the opening of}} the song as [...] "a burst of howling guitar feedback and jubilant, church-like organ", adding: [...] "The atmosphere hints at Harrison's fascination with Indian music and Hindu philosophy at the time, having a distinct, Eastern-flavored, droning undercurrent." [...] Following the intro to [...] "I Feel Fine" [...] in 1964, [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] is a rare example of the Beatles' use of feedback on a recording and suggests the influence of Jimi Hendrix. Womack credits this guitar part to Harrison, who played his Epiphone Casino using [...] "the instrument's Bigsby [...] bar in searing, full vibrato force". Harrison later rued the prominence of the brass accompaniment, saying: [...] "To this day I am still annoyed that I let them <b>mess</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> with those damn trumpets. Basically, the song's quite good but, you know, messed up with those trumpets." ...|$|E
5000|$|Singer Eric Von Schmidt has {{a similar}} {{recollection}} of the event: [...] "Whoever was controlling the mics <b>messed</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> You couldn't hear Dylan. It {{looked like he was}} singing with the volume off." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bubbles (voiced by Julie McWhirter) - Bubbles is a {{young woman}} with blonde, curly hair who plays {{keyboard}} for The Neptunes. She is extremely ditzy and dimwitted, has a cute giggle, similar to Josie and the Pussycats' Melody. Shelly sometimes nicknames her [...] "Ding-a-Ling" [...] or [...] "Bubblehead".

Goofy tries baking a cake, but keeps <b>messing</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> such as making too much noise while it's baking, and baking the cake in volcano heat. So, Goofy went to the bakery and bought Mickey a cake.|$|R
500|$|Skaaren's {{first draft}} {{retained}} {{some of the}} more sinister characteristics of McDowell's Betelgeuse, but toned down the character to make him a troublesome pervert rather than blatantly murderous. Betelgeuse's true form was that of the Middle Eastern man, and much of his dialogue was written in African American Vernacular English. This version concluded with the Deetzes returning to New York and leaving Lydia in the care of the Maitlands, who, with Lydia's help, transform the exterior of their home into a stereotypical haunted house while returning the interior to its previous state. [...] It also would have featured deleted scenes such as the real-estate agent, Jane, trying to convince the Deetzes to allow her to sell the house for them (having sold it to them in the first place—Charles and Delia decline), and a reveal on how Beetlejuice had died centuries earlier (that he'd attempted to hang himself while drunk, only to <b>mess</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> and died slowly choking to death, rather than quickly by snapping his neck) and wound-up working for Juno before striking it out on his own as a [...] "free-lance Bio-Exorcist".|$|E

50|$|Mather's debut {{big screen}} role {{was in a}} film Chasing Shakespeare, co-starring Danny Glover and Graham Greene. Her first ever scene on set was with Danny Glover, which she {{described}} as terrifying because {{she was afraid to}} <b>mess</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
50|$|But {{watching}} them forcing on a smile while obviously annoyed by each other’s company, the audience can instinctively {{tell that the}} two will soon part ways ― {{in spite of their}} genuine efforts and affection for each other. The movie reaches its climax as the two flawed characters realize that they've <b>messed</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> again, that they can no longer be in denial, and there are some things in life that cannot be controlled no matter how hard they try.|$|R

"Brian Jones was {{lurking in}} his collar," [...] Mankowitz commented years later, [...] "I was {{frustrated}} because {{it felt like}} we {{were on the verge of}} something really special and he was <b>messing</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> But the way Brian appeared to not give a shit is exactly what the band was about." [...] Outtakes from this photo session were later used for the cover and inner sleeves of the 1972 ABKCO compilation release More Hot Rocks (Big Hits & Fazed Cookies).|$|R
5000|$|The Palestinians {{are in a}} {{situation}} of insanity reminiscent of the insanity of the German people in the Nazi period. The Palestinians are not the first people that the Jewish people has driven insane.(Subsequent clarification by Yehoshua) I ask myself a question that must be asked: What brought the Germans and what is bringing the Palestinians to such hatred of us? ...

5000|$|O'Connor has {{reflected}} on her {{time on the}} Supreme Court by saying that she regrets the court hearing the Bush v. Gore case in 2000 because <b>it</b> [...] "stirred <b>up</b> the public" [...] and [...] "gave the court a less-than-perfect reputation." [...] The former justice told the Chicago Tribune that [...] "Maybe the court should have said, 'We’re {{not going to take}} it, goodbye,’...It turned out the election authorities in Florida hadn’t done a real good job there and kind of <b>messed</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> And probably the Supreme Court added to the problem {{at the end of the}} day.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Elvis' primary {{producer}} Felton Jarvis made the unusual decision {{to add a}} premature fade-out to the song starting at 3:36 and lasting for 15 seconds before fading back in. The first verse then continues repeatedly until it completely fades out. In a 2012 interview with Marc Myers of The Wall Street Journal, Moman disclosed that Jarvis was never happy with Elvis recording at American Sound Studio, saying [...] "it was a control thing." [...] Moman added, [...] "So when Jarvis took the tape of 'Suspicious Minds,' he added this crazy 15-second fade toward the end, like the song was ending, and brought it back by overdubbing to extend it. I {{have no idea why}} he did that, but he <b>messed</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> <b>It</b> was like a scar. None of which mattered. Soon after the song was released, Elvis was back on top of the charts." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jack-Katie-Brad - In 2007, Jack Snyder and Katie Peretti fell in {{love and}} got married.

5000|$|A Toynbee-tile enthusiast website {{reported}} a tile found in Pittsburgh that included deployment instructions, which the reader transcribed as [...] "linoleum, asphalt glue (?) in several layers, then placing tar paper over {{it so that}} car wheels won't <b>mess</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> and apparently {{the heat of the}} sun on the tar paper will bake it into the street". This tile was located near the Pittsburgh Hilton, and has since been paved over.|$|E
5000|$|... "Burning Benches" [...] was {{according}} to the band, {{not so much about}} love as it was about obsession. Greener said, [...] "It sounded a bit too lovely, which is why we made it louder towards the end, we wanted to <b>mess</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> a bit." [...] It was inspired by the surreal David Lynch horror film Eraserhead, in which the main character Henry Spencer watches and listens to the Lady in the Radiator sing about finding happiness in heaven.|$|E

It hit me in the shinguard, bounced out to Clete Boyer at third base and he threw out the runner at first. Talk about a weird assist: 2-5-3 on a strikeout." ...|$|R

50|$|Another rider in the race, Pete Ryalls, said in Procycling in 2008:The fix was for Barry Hoban to win. Barry was {{touch and}} go whether he'd get another {{contract}} because he'd done sweet FA all season. And it all went wrong because he didn't have the form anyway and it's a bloody long way if you don't have the legs. And the thing that <b>messed</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> was that going across Anglesey a big tall lanky guy called Peter Gordon. He pushed off and caused all sorts of consternation and {{the only people who}} could get across to him were Simpson and the guys he'd brought across with him, and Hitchen... so presumably they sorted it out between them afterwards, but that was the fix: that Hoban should win.
