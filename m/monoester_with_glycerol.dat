40|$|Immobilised lipase B (Candida {{antarctica}} lipase B) is, perhaps unexpectedly, catalytically {{active in}} liquid ammonia and exhibits chain length selectivity in the ammonolysis of triglycerides. Using glycerol triacetate as the substrate, the ammonolysis {{of only the}} first ester linkage is catalysed by the enzyme, whereas for glycerol tributyrate, the cleavage of all three ester groups is catalysed and converted to the corresponding amide. These observations represent the first example {{of the use of}} enzymes in pure liquid ammonia, exemplifying both catalysis and selectivity. Glycerol trioleate is relatively stable in liquid ammonia but, with Candida antarctica lipase B present, readily undergoes ammonolysis to give oleamide and glycerol even at 25 °C. There is no enzyme-catalysed ammonolysis with the native lipase as it is insoluble in liquid ammonia. The solvolysis of triglycerides in liquid ammonia occurs by a stepwise conversion of the triester to diester to <b>monoester</b> to <b>glycerol</b> <b>with</b> one equivalent of carboxylic acid amide produced at each stage. The pseudo first-order rate constants {{for each of the three}} steps of the uncatalysed ammonolysis of triglycerides in liquid ammonia decrease with increasing alkyl chain length in the carboxyl residue as expected from a small steric effect...|$|R

Particle size and viscosity in different regions of the phase diagrams were measured, solubility of a model drug, danazol, in different lipid-surfactant mixtures was determined, and dispersion testing by diluting selected preconcentrates with 250 ml 0. 01 NHCl was performed. Further, phase diagrams were constructed using binary mixtures of lipids (<b>monoester</b> <b>with</b> diester, or <b>monoester</b> <b>with</b> triester) in place of single lipids. The phase diagrams of PG dicaprylocaprate and glycerol tricaprylocaprate were similar, while it was distinctly different for PG monocaprylate. The microemulsion regions in phase diagrams were rather limited for individual lipids, and additionally, the diand tri-esters showed pronounced gel regions in the phase diagrams, which could influence drug release from preconcentrates. The mixing of PG monocaprylate (<b>monoester)</b> <b>with</b> PG dicaprylocaprate (diester) or glycerol tricaprylocaprate (triester) had dramatic effects on the performance of lipids as evidenced by the greatly reduced gel phases, much larger microemulsion regions, faster dispersion of the preconcentrates in an aqueous medium, and smaller particle size of the microemulsions subsequently formed...|$|R

Nonstabilized (original) fast pyrolysis oil was also upgraded via HDO or TT to obtain benchmarks. Generally, HDO decreases the molecular weight of PO. The major beneficial effect of stabilization <b>with</b> <b>glycerol</b> was reduction in molecular {{weight of the}} upgraded oil.

Stabilization of PO <b>with</b> <b>glycerol,</b> however, led to an increase in the yield of aqueous fractions of HDO and TT due to the formation of hydrophilic fragments from glycerol and PO constituents. After HDO, the oil fractions of stabilized and nonstabilized PO exhibited similar H/C and O/C molar ratios, suggesting that oxygen removal from the oil fractions was not significantly affected by stabilization...|$|R

40|$|Summary Mutation or {{inactivation}} of p 53 {{is known}} to be present in approximately 50 % of human cancers. We propose here a novel strategy for overcoming this problem in mutant p 53 -targeting cancer therapies. We examined the restoration of radiation-induced p 53 -dependent apoptosis by a chemical chaperone (glycerol) in human head and neck cancer cells (SAS cells, showing wild-type p 53 phenotype). SAS cells transfected with mutant p 53 (SAS/mp 53) showed radioresistance compared with SAS cells (SAS/neo) transfected with neo vector as a control, but became radiosensitive when pre-treated <b>with</b> <b>glycerol</b> before X-ray irradiation. Apoptosis in the SAS/mp 53 cells was induced by X-rays <b>with</b> <b>glycerol</b> pre-treatment, but not without glycerol pre-treatment, whereas apoptosis in the SAS/neo cells was induced in both cases. Gel mobility-shift assays showed that after X-ray irradiation combined <b>with</b> <b>glycerol</b> pre-treatment, mp 53 was able to bind to the sequencespecific region upstream of the bax gene regulating apoptosis. These results suggest that glycerol is effective in inducing a conformational change of p 53 and restoring normal function to mp 53, leading to enhanced radiosensitivity through the induction of apoptosis. This novel tool for enhancement of radiosensitivity in cancer cells bearing mp 53 may be useful for p 53 -targeted radiotherapy. © 2000 Cancer Researc...|$|R
