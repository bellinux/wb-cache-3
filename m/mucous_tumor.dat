40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the frequency and}} clinicopathological features of ROS 1 and RET rearrangements in N 2 node positive stage IIIA (IIIA-N 2) {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) patients, we retrospectively screened 204 cases with a tissue microarray (TMA) panel by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and confirmed by direct sequencing and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The relationship between ROS 1 or RET rearrangements, clinicopathological features, and prognostic factors were analyzed in resected stage IIIA-N 2 NSCLC. Of the 204 cases, 4 cases were confirmed with ROS 1 rearrangement, but no RET rearrangement was detected. All 4 ROS 1 -rearranged cases were adenocarcinomas. The predominant pathological type was acinar pattern in ROS 1 -rearranged tumors, except for 1 case harboring a mixture acinar and <b>mucous</b> <b>tumor</b> cells. Variants of ROS 1 rearrangement were SDC 4 -ROS 1 (E 2 :E 32), SDC 4 -ROS 1 (E 4 :E 32) and SDC 4 -ROS 1 (E 4 :E 34). There was no significant association between ROS 1 rearrangement and clinicopathological characteristics. In this cohort, multivariate analysis for overall survival (OS) indicated that squamous cell carcinoma and lobectomy were independent predictors of poor prognosis; R 0 surgical resection and non-pleural invasion were independent predictors of good prognosis. In resected stage IIIA-N 2 NSCLC patients, ROS 1 -rearranged cases tended to occur in younger patients with adenocarcinomas. The prognosis of resected stage IIIA-N 2 is generally considered poor, but patients with ROS 1 rearrangement will benefit from the targeted therapy...|$|E
40|$|Ovarian endometriosis can {{transform}} into malignant tumors. The author retrospectively examined HE slides of 112 serous tumors and 75 mucinous tumors {{for the existence}} of ovarian endometriosis. When endometriosis is present within the tumors, the term “endometriosis-derived tumor” was applied. When endometriosis is recognized adjacent to the tumor, the term “endometriosis-associated tumor” was used. Of the 112 serous tumors (46 benign, 18 borderline, and 50 malignant), 4 (3. 5 %) (2 benign and 2 malignant) were endometriosis-associated tumors. None was endometriosis-derived tumor. Of the 75 mucinous tumors (30 benign, 26 borderline, and 19 malignant), 4 (5 %) (1 borderline and 3 benign) were endometriosis-associated tumors. No tumors showed endometriosis-derived tumors. The data suggest that endometriosis does not transform into serous and <b>mucous</b> <b>tumors.</b> The author felt the limitation of retrospective survey, because the limited numbers of slides (5 to 15) were obtained from each tumor. The author also felt that endometriosis can be difficult to discern because of degenerative changes and other similar lesions such as fallopian tube, fimbria, inclusion cysts, rete ovarii, paraovarian cyst, and Müllerian ducts remnants. Prospective study using whole ovarian examination is required...|$|R
30|$|We found a 13.6 -cm hypovascular {{tumor in}} the left hepatic lobe of a 68 -year-old man, which we {{initially}} diagnosed as a mass-forming intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Left lobe and caudate resection was performed without major intraoperative or postoperative complications. He was discharged home on postoperative day 9 and had no recurrence for 6  months. Pathological examination showed a <b>mucous</b> lobulated <b>tumor</b> with abundant mucus in the cytoplasm and extracellular regions. After differential diagnosis that considered invasive intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct and metastatic liver tumors from the digestive tract, this tumor was diagnosed as a cholangiocarcinoma rare variant: primary mucinous carcinoma of the liver.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Papillomas or warts {{are easily}} {{recognized}} skin or <b>mucous</b> membrane <b>tumors.</b> They {{are common in}} wild species and are particularly well known in deer (Cosgrove and Fay 1981; Sundberg and Nielson 1981). Most of these tumors are caused by papillomaviruses (PVs). Tumors can become quite large and numerous and persist for prolonged periods, but they usually regress, providing the individual with long-term immunity to future infections. Occasionally, the tumors will progress to squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, or sebaceous carcinoma that will eventually kill the host if not treated. Specific mucosotropic PV types and those infecting immunodeficient individuals are prone to induce malignancies. Virtually all mammalian species are hosts for one of more PV. This chapter {{provides an overview of}} PV infections in mammals. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT-One hundred human primary lung carcinomas {{were studied}} by light and {{electron}} microscopy and by light microscopic histochemistry to demonstrate mucosubstances. The tumors were classified histogenetically and were grouped Into three major categories {{depending on their}} cell of origin: 1) tumors from basal and/or <b>mucous</b> cells; 2) <b>tumors</b> from neuro-secretory cells; and 3) tumors from Clara cells. Most carcinomas (88 %) arose from basal and/or mucous cells. These were sub-divided Into epidermoid carcinomas (21 %), combined epidermoid and adenocarcinomas (46 %), and adenocarcinomas (21 %). The criteria for epidermoid differentiation Included the presence of tonofilament bundles, poorly developed endoplasmic reticulum and Goigi apparatus, and well-developed desmosomes. The criteria for adeno differentiation Included well-developed endo-plasmic reticulum and Goigi apparatus, poorly developed desmo...|$|R
40|$|Papillomaviruses induce {{hyperplastic}} and tumoral lesions {{in different}} animal species 4. We describe {{a case of}} Papillomavirus-Associated adenocarcinoma which occurred in a 41 –year-old male white rhinoceros, maintained at the Zoological Garden of Pistoia, Tuscany 3, 5. The rhinoceros showed weight loss and difficulty in chewing the hay for three months before death 2. At necroscopy, the most relevant finding was a lesion that involved the tongue, characterized by erosion of the mucosa with increased involvement of the dorsal surface. The cut surface showed lardaceous appearance with escape of purulent material. Histologically, the mass predominantly involved the submucosa and muscular portion of the tongue, resulting in closely packed large, medium, and small glands consisted of columnar cells without <b>mucous</b> cells. <b>Tumor</b> cells exhibited amphophilic to pale eosinophilic cytoplasm, high nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio and medium mitotic rate. No squamous differentiation was noted, and the squamous epithelium immediately adjacent to the adenocarcinoma showed slight perinuclear halos suggestive of PV-related changes. The tumor cells showed diffuse staining for A 1 -A 3 pan-keratins, but staining for keratin 7 (CK 7) clearly separated the adenocarcinoma from the adjacent non-neoplastic squamous epithelium. Keratin 19, keratin 20 and MUC- 5 AC were negative. Immunohistochemical staining performed with a monoclonal antibody against papillomaviruses evidenced a strong nuclear immunoreactivity only in glandular epithelium similarly to CK 7. DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue was tested by PCR using degenerated primers (FAP 59 - 64), amplifying common gene region of papillomaviral L 11. The PCR result was an amplicon of 480 bp. Sequence similarity analysis with the BLAST tool of the National Center for Biotechnology Information and Papillomavirus Episteme tool showed that this fragments belongs to new putative PVs, not yet characterized for rhinoceros. To our knowledge {{this is the first}} case of Papillomavirus-Associated non-salivary gland-type adenocarcinoma arising in the base of the tongue in a captive white rhinoceros...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A 7 -year-old Holstein cow {{developed}} a large cystic {{mass in the}} region between the atlantoaxis and larynx. The mass extended to the synovium in the atlanto-occipital joint. Many villous projections were present on the inner surface of the tumor tissue, and irregular clefts were formed in the inside. Two cell types, epithelioid-like synovioblasts and spindle cells, were present. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the cells stained positively for cytokeratin (AE 1 /AE 3) and vimentin. Both cells had similar fine structures ultra-structurally. Vacuoles present in the cytoplasm were full of an acid <b>mucous</b> substance. The <b>tumor</b> was diagnosed as a well-differentiated biphasic synovial sarcoma. This is the first report of a rare case of synovial sarcoma, {{from the viewpoint of}} its origin. Key words: Atlanto-occipital joint; cattle; synovial sarcoma; synovioblast. Synovial tumors generally occur in the joints of extremi-ties and are common in dogs, cats, 1, 6 – 8 and humans 2 but rare-ly occur in large animals. To date, only three cases of sy-novial tumors have been reported in cattle, all of which oc-curred in the joint of the fore or hind extremities. 3, 5, 10 We discovered a very rare case of synovial sarcoma that devel...|$|R
40|$|Apoptosis {{has to be}} {{drastically}} controlled in organs {{with important}} cell turnover such as the colon. Deregulation {{of this process is}} often present in tumor progression. Tissues of 82 patients treated for colorectal cancer (CRC) were analyzed using antibodies against AIF, p 53, DR 4, DR 5, cleaved caspase- 3 and the TUNEL method to detect apoptosis; whereas staining of Ki- 67 was used as a proliferation marker. In situ immuno-histochemical analyses were compared in non-tumor (NT) cells from normal adjacent <b>mucous</b> membranes with <b>tumor</b> (T) cells from patients with Stage I (n= 6), Stage II (n= 35), Stage III (n= 27) and Stage IV (n= 14) CRC. Results were correlated with the tumor stages and the treatment response of patients to improve the understanding of CRC development. p 53 and DR 5 expression decreased progressively with CRC stage, suggesting that these proteins are important markers of advanced tumor stages. Moreover, p 53 appears as a prognostic factor to predict recurrence-free survival. Including the detection of p 53 and DR 5 for establishing the diagnosis of CRC and adapting the treatment to each patient is strongly suggested by our work...|$|R
