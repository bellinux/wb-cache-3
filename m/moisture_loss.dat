Keratinocytes form the outermost {{layers of the}} skin, {{as well as some}} mucosal surfaces, such as the inside of the cheek or the walls of the vagina. These surface tissues, which are known as stratified squamous epithelia, are composed of stacked layers of flattened cells. The cell layers are formed through a process known as cellular differentiation, in which keratinocytes gradually become specialized, eventually forming a hard, crosslinked surface that prevents <b>moisture</b> <b>loss</b> and acts as a barrier against pathogens. Less-differentiated keratinocyte stem cells, replenished on the surface layer, are thought to be the initial target of productive papillomavirus infections. Subsequent steps in the viral life cycle are strictly dependent on the process of keratinocyte differentiation. As a result, papillomaviruses can only replicate in body surface tissues.|$|E

25|$|As f {{decreases}} progressively during condensation, {{the remaining}} vapor {{becomes more and}} more depleted of the heavy isotopes, and the magnitude of depletion becomes larger as f approaches zero. The Rayleigh distillation process can explain some first-order spatial patterns observed in the isotopic composition of precipitation across the globe, including isotopic depletion from the tropics to the poles, isotopic depletion from coastal to inland regions, and isotopic depletion with elevation over a mountain range, all of which are associated with progressive <b>moisture</b> <b>loss</b> during transport. The Rayleigh distillation model {{can also be used to}} explain the strong correlation between δD and δ18O observed in global precipitation, expressed as the global meteoric water line (GMWL): δD=8δ18O+10 (later updated to δD=8.17±0.07 δ18O+11.27±0.65) The slope of the GMWL reflects the relative magnitude of hydrogen and oxygen isotope fractionation during condensation. It should be noted that the intercept of GMWL is non-zero (called deuterium-excess, or d-excess), which means ocean water does fall on GMWL. This is associated with the kinetic isotope effect during evaporation when water vapor diffuses from the saturated boundary layer to the unsaturated transition zone, and cannot be explained by the Rayleigh model. Nevertheless, the robust pattern in GMWL strongly suggests a single dominant moisture source to the global atmosphere, which is the tropical western Pacific. It should also be pointed out that a local meteoric water line can have a different slope and intercept from the GMWL, due to differences in humidity and evaporation intensity at different places. Hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in water thus serve as an excellent tracer of the hydrological cycle both globally and locally.|$|E

30|$|Drying {{times of}} Eucalyptus logs can vary up to eightfold {{depending}} on weather conditions. Such large time variation poses tremendous uncertainty in flow planning and quality control (Simpson and Wang 2004). Additionally, moisture content {{has an impact}} on transport costs and bioenergy yields, and therefore accurately determining air-drying times becomes critical for minimising costs and maximising returns. As expected, there is a clear seasonal effect with logs drying faster when stacked in late spring to early summer than in late summer to early autumn, which can be explained by observed values of air relative humidity and temperature being the main environmental drivers of log <b>moisture</b> content <b>loss.</b> Although climate (season) was the main drive of log <b>moisture</b> content <b>loss,</b> there were also important effects of species and debarking treatments on this variable. E. globulus dried on average 20  % faster than E. nitens, and debarking enhanced <b>moisture</b> content <b>loss</b> by 8  %. For instance, in order to reduce 20  %, the moisture content on a green basis, E. globulus logs, with bark, harvested/stacked in January would take 22  days compared to 29 for E. nitens. Similarly, debarking would reduce drying times from 22 to 17  days in E. globulus and from 29 to 20  days in E. nitens to achieve a 20  % reduction in moisture content for piles freshly harvested/stacked in January. Visser et al. (2014) also found faster drying of debarked logs of P. radiata, suggesting that radial water movements are a significant contributor to the log drying process. Log lengths did not {{have a significant effect on}} <b>moisture</b> content <b>loss</b> in our study, although 244 -cm logs dried on average 3  % faster than 350 -cm logs.|$|R

A number of weeds, such as the dandelion (Taraxacum) and lamb's quarter, are edible, and their leaves or roots {{may be used for}} food or herbal medicine. Burdock is common over much of the world, and is sometimes used to make soup and medicine in East Asia. Some weeds attract beneficial insects, which in turn can protect crops from harmful pests. Weeds can also prevent pest insects from finding a crop, because their presence disrupts the incidence of positive cues which pests use to locate their food. Weeds may also act as a [...] "living mulch", providing ground cover that reduces <b>moisture</b> <b>loss</b> and prevents erosion. Weeds may also improve soil fertility; dandelions, for example, bring up nutrients like calcium and nitrogen from deep in the soil with their tap root, and clover hosts nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its roots, fertilizing the soil directly. The dandelion is also one of several species which break up hardpan in overly cultivated fields, helping crops grow deeper root systems. Some garden flowers originated as weeds in cultivated fields and have been selectively bred for their garden-worthy flowers or foliage. An example of a crop weed that is grown in gardens is the corncockle, (Agrostemma githago), which was a common weed in European wheat fields, but is now sometimes grown as a garden plant.|$|E

Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the relationship between anatomy and wood drying. Samples with 2 x 2 x 4 cm were obtained from eight Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus grandis clones at 1. 3 m height to evaluate the anatomy and drying in climate chamber during 15 days. Cell wall fraction was established as the parameter that best correlated with drying, the Pearson correlation coefficient between this parameter and moisture was - 0. 8986, - 0. 6580, 0. 9216, 0. 8743, 0. 7131 and 0. 8727 for saturated wood, and after 1, 2. 5, 5, 10 and 15 days of drying, respectively. The frequency and vessel size, as well as the height and width of the rays showed low relation with wood drying.

40|$|Synopsis: The {{moisture}} diffusivity is {{of considerable}} importance for quantitative assessments of creep and shrinkage {{as well as}} durability of cementitious material. For this reason, {{the influence of the}} composition of repair mortars on their effective moisture diffusivity {{as a function of the}} relative humidity of the surrounding air has been investigated.

A computer program based on the finite volume method has been used in order to get the best effective moisture diffusivity by comparing experimental results (<b>moisture</b> <b>losses</b> of drying mortar cylinders) with the numerical solution. The applicability of a combined experimental-numerical approach to characterize repair mortars regarding their moisture diffusivity has been demonstrated.
