Polyurethane (PU) {{adhesives}} {{were prepared}} {{from three different}} polyols based on polycaprolactone (PCL) /palm kernel oil (PKO) with an aromatic and cycloaliphatic diisocyanate.

The effects of NCO/OH ratios and types of diisocyanate on PU adhesive strength were investigated.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to characterize the pure mode 1 delamination growth in <b>metal</b> <b>to</b> <b>metal</b> adhesively <b>bonded</b> joints under static and fatigue loading conditions, using FM 73 adhesive. Double cantilever beam specimens (DCB) were used for pure mode 1 tests. Aluminum 2024 -T 3 adherends were bonded with FM 73 adhesive. Delamination was introduced during fabrication by inserting a Teflon film between the two adherends. The mode 1 strain energy release rate G sub I sub c was obtained directly from static DCB tests conducted in accordance with the ASTM designation D 1876 - 12. Constant amplitude fatigue tests on DCB specimens were conducted to determine the relationship between delamination growth rate da/dN and strain energy release rate G sub I sub c for a pure mode 1 delamination growth. It is found that the debond propagation rate in adhesive joints using FM 73 is more sensitive to errors in design load than is typical crack growth rate in metallic structures...|$|R
40|$|Waterborne {{adhesives}} for rubber <b>to</b> <b>metal</b> <b>bonding</b> {{have been}} available since 1990. However, published information about their formulation has been limited, as proprietary restrictions are exercised by companies. As a consequence, the way these adhesives interact with substrates has not been studied extensively. With the aim of investigating the effect the components of a waterborne adhesive have on rubber <b>to</b> <b>metal</b> <b>bonding,</b> fractional factorial and surface response methodologies of design of experiments were employed in this study. Twenty six formulations were prepared with a polychloroprene latex as the adhesive polymer. Viscosity, wettability and non-volatile solids content were measured with each liquid adhesive, while the mechanical strength was evaluated by applying a tensile mechanical stress over cured solid adhesive films. Adhesion properties were evaluated by using a single lap-shear test on <b>metal</b> <b>to</b> <b>metal</b> joints and a pull-out test on rubber <b>to</b> <b>metal</b> joints. The {{results showed that the}} components with the largest relative influence on cohesive and adhesives forces were tackifier resin, silicon dioxide and polychloroprene latex type. In order to better understand the contributions of these variables, mathematical models correlating them with the response variables were obtained. This study is valuable in explaining how, through statistical methods, a waterborne adhesive for rubber <b>to</b> <b>metal</b> <b>bonding</b> can be formulated with a reasonably low number of experiments.

40|$|Abstract. Journal {{bearings}} {{are widely}} applied in different rotating machineries. These bearings allow for transmission of large loads at mean speed of rotation. These bearings {{are susceptible to}} large amplitude lateral vibration due to self exited instability which is known as oil whirl or synchronous whirl.

As oil film thickness decreases <b>metal</b> <b>to</b> <b>metal</b> contact occurs this further can damage the journal bearing. So during the operation minimum oil film thickness should be maintained which can avoid the <b>metal</b> <b>to</b> <b>metal</b> contact and further increases the life of bearing.
