40|$|Abstract -In {{this thesis}} a {{design of a}} Coriolis <b>mass</b> <b>flow-meter</b> is chosen by {{considering}} all advantages and disadvantages and the project requirements. The chosen geometry is imported into COMSOL, because modelling is implemented by FEM and two different physics should be coupled. To consider both applications of the device include measuring density and flow rate, modeling {{is divided into two}} parts: Coriolis density meter and Coriolis <b>mass</b> <b>flow-meter.</b> Both applications are based on Fluid Structure Interaction. The results are compared to existing setup’s experimental data.

The design of inherently safe processes is currently' viewed as a necessary target of the engineering discipline (Gupta and Ed~ards, 2002) [...] Alkylpyridines and their N-oxides are being used widely as intermediates and final products in the Phannaceutical Industry. Under typical industrial conditions the N-oxidation reaction is performed catalytically, in the liquid phaSe in a semi-batch mode. Hydrogen peroxide is used as the oxidising agent. It is dosed over the alkylpyridine-catalyst mixture over a period of time. The desired N-oxidation is accompanied by one only additional reaction, the lpldesired decomposition ofhydrogen peroxide. The catalytic N-oxidation of selected picolines, lutidines and collidines were performed in an HEL SIMULARÃ‚Â® lL calorimeter at conditions very close to the industrial'ones, following a certain procedure. The catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide alone, under the same conditions was also studied. A sensitive <b>mass</b> <b>flow-meter</b> MKS 1179 A Mass-FloÃ‚Â® was used for the continuous measurement of the oxygen produced by the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, thus. allowing the split {{of the power of the}} two reactions. The heat of reaction has been evaluated for all the selected N-oxidation and hydrogen peroxide decomposition reactions. The concentration of the a 1 kylpyridines and their N-oxides was measured using HPLC. These measurements confirmed that the hydrogen peroxide decompositio~ was the only parallel reaction. Integration of the thermal power evolution curves also provided a continuous measure of concentration [...] These curves were found to be in good agreement with the HPLC measurements. The reactions were studied using heat-flow and power compensation calorimetry at subcooled conditions. Their study shows that their N-oxidation follows Langmuir type kinetics. The paraIlel decomposition ofhydrogen peroxide also follows the same type ofkinetics. Their kinetic study was based on the kinetic model of Sempere et al, 1998, whi~h was improved and refined. The model of Sempere et al., 1998 on a-picoline assumes paths of reaction, in which, the employedÃ‚Â· catalyst, phosphotungstic acid, does not participate. However, as reported in our previous work (papadaki et al., 2002 a), no reaction takes place in the absence of phosphotungstic acid. The kinetic model proposed by Sempere et al. 1998 has thus been modified to account for those paths. The modified model is, as before, based on the assumption of very fast always in equilibrium reactions or interactions for the formation of intermediates which subsequently react in a number of ways to give the final products. All paths of the modified model are catalytic. The new kinetic model has been tested and found to be,:in good agreement with experimental data. A number of runaway scenarios of the excess of hydrogen peroxide used during the N-oxidation of alkylpyridines, under closed and open conditions, were examined. It was found that, in most cases, if the volume of the liquid hydrogen peroxide solution occupies more than 10 % ofthe total volume ofa closed system (e. g. reactor and vent line between reactor and blockage), the production of gases raises the pressure so quickly that evaporation is completely suppressed. Higher that 70 % filling levels result in complete expansion of the liquid~The MTSR(t) (the inaximum temperature attained by the synthesis reaction) of the system falls rapidly if th~ normal process temperature is high, but if a runaway. occurs exactly at the end of dosing, MTST (the maximum temperature reached during the synthesis reaction) will be very high and secondary decompositions will rapidly develop. The results of this study are currently being used to critically assess the current approaches and to further the study ofinherently safer designs.

40|$|New static {{thermal mass}} {{principle}} {{is a very}} promising technology for gas flow-metering since it offers very significant potential such as digital output, absence of moving parts, direct mass measurement. Unfortunately, gas quality is expected to affect metrological performance of thermal <b>mass</b> <b>flow-meters</b> (TMFs), as far as flow disturbances and such conditions often occur in modern networks. In this paper the authors investigate the sensitivity of TMFs with natural gas quality changes and different flow disturbances. To this end, a metrological test campaign {{has been carried out}} through specifically designed laboratory test bench and facilities. The results of the tests with gas quality changes show the capillary TMFs are able to recognize the natural gas flowing strictly included in the EN 437 group H and to consequently apply specific correction factors. On the other hand, capillary TMFs have been found sensitive to high contents of CO 2 and N 2, like in biogas and natural gases at the borders of group H. Finally, flow disturbances tests show the accuracy of full bore insertion in line TMFs is affected by the interaction between sensor and piping both for double out-of plane bend and single 90 ° bend disturbances...|$|R
40|$|Regional lung {{function}} {{was assessed by}} radiographic methods, by regional function studies using xenon- 133 scans, and by lobar sampling with a <b>mass</b> spectrometer <b>flow-meter</b> at bronchoscopy in 12 patients who subsequently had bullae resected at operation. The information given by these three methods of regional assessment was subsequently compared with the findings at operation. When only one lobe was abnormal on the radiographs, these alone were adequate to locate the major site of the emphysema and the regional tests gave relatively little extra information. The xenon scan was sometimes helpful in assessing {{the state of the}} remaining lung, but this information could be deduced from the radiographs and overall {{lung function}} tests, especially the carbon monoxide transfer and mechanical measurements. Bronchoscopic sampling was helpful in determining whether the affected lobe was acting as a ventilated dead-space. When more than one lobe was affected the regional function tests supplemented the radiographs in defining the site of bullous change as well as locating dead space. Xenon scans, although widely employed for such preoperative assessments, added little to the topographical information obtained by careful radiology. The combination of radiology, lobar sampling, and overall function tests is recommended for assessing which emphysematous patients are likely to benefit from surgery...|$|R
