5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>unit</b> began filming on 1 April 1997 {{at the new}} studios, before filming {{at other}} UK locations; {{production}} then moved to Thailand in May. Filming completed three weeks over schedule in September 1997. Eon initially approached John Barry to score the film, but the two sides could not come to terms; the producers then approached David Arnold, whom Barry endorsed.|$|E
5|$|In October filming {{moved to}} other Greek locations, {{including}} Metéora and the Achilleion. In November, the <b>main</b> <b>unit</b> moved to England, which included interior work in Pinewood, {{while the second}} unit shot underwater scenes in The Bahamas. On 1 January 1981, production moved to Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy, where filming wrapped in February. Since it was not snowing in Cortina d'Ampezzo {{by the time of}} filming, the producers had to pay for trucks to bring snow from nearby mountains, which was then dumped in the city's streets.|$|E
5|$|The 23rd Division (South Vietnam) {{under the}} command of Brigadier General Tran Van Cam was the <b>main</b> <b>unit</b> {{defending}} Ban Me Thuot and the surrounding areas. Major General Pham Van Phu had at his disposal five artillery battalions equipped with 146 artillery guns, and one armoured brigade of about 117 tanks and armoured vehicles. The South Vietnamese military also stationed air force and naval units in Ban Me Thuot.|$|E

5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>unit</b> {{of local}} {{government}} was the parish, and since it was {{also part of the}} church, the elders imposed public humiliation for what the locals considered immoral behaviour, including fornication, drunkenness, wife beating, cursing and Sabbath breaking. The main focus was on the poor and the landlords ("lairds") and gentry, and their servants, were not subject to the parish's discipline. The policing system weakened after 1800 and disappeared in most places by the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|The press {{would not}} meet Dalton and d'Abo until 5 October 1986, when the <b>main</b> <b>unit</b> {{travelled}} to Vienna. Almost {{two weeks after}} the second unit filming on Gibraltar, the first unit started shooting with Andreas Wisniewski and stunt man Bill Weston. During the course of the three days it took to film this fight, Weston fractured a finger and Wisniewski knocked him out once. The next day found the crew on location at Stonor House, doubling for Bladen's Safe House, the first scene Jeroen Krabbé filmed.|$|E
5|$|After losing {{half its}} strength, No. 38 Squadron {{remained}} at Changi and conducted supply and aeromedical evacuation flights throughout Malaya {{to support the}} British-led forces there. The squadron's aircraft were also occasionally used to mark targets ahead of bombing raids and to drop propaganda leaflets. From April to July 1951, No. 38 Squadron and an attached flight from No. 41 Squadron RNZAF was stationed at RAF Kuala Lumpur, and was the <b>main</b> <b>unit</b> tasked with dropping supplies to Commonwealth forces in the field. The squadron made another deployment to Kuala Lumpur between November 1951 and February 1952. In February 1952, No. 38 Squadron successfully parachuted 54 personnel from the British 22nd Special Air Service Regiment into a remote area near the Malaya-Thailand border.|$|E

5|$|Although Southern California and Mexico were {{considered}} for the <b>main</b> <b>unit</b> filming, the Hawaiian island of Kaua'i (where Stiller has a home) was selected {{for the majority of}} the shooting. Kaua'i was chosen over Mexico because a tax credit for in-state spending was negotiated with the Kaua'i Film Commission. John Toll, the cinematographer, stated the island was also selected for its similarity to Vietnam, based on its dense foliage, variety of terrains, and weather. Kaua'i was first scouted as a possible location to film Tropic Thunder in 2004. Stiller spent more than 25 hours over 6 weeks exploring the island, using all-terrain vehicles, boats, and helicopters. After the film was greenlit by DreamWorks in 2006, pre-production lasted for six months, most of this time spent on scouting additional locations for filming. Filming for the Los Angeles and interior scenes occurred on sets at Universal Studios in Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began on}} June 26, 1997, and ended on September 30 of that year, {{primarily}} {{taking place at}} Leavesden Film Studios in England. Leavesden was leased for a {{two and a half}} years so the production company could leave the sets intact and return after principal photography had been completed. The forest scenes on Naboo were filmed at Cassiobury Park in Watford, Hertfordshire. Pick-ups were shot between August 1998 and February 1999 after Lucas screened a rough cut of the film for friends and colleagues in May 1998. Most of the action and stunts were filmed by Roger Christian's second unit, which worked alongside the <b>main</b> <b>unit</b> instead of afterwards because of the high number of shots to be completed daily.|$|E
5|$|In October filming {{moved to}} other Greek locations, {{including}} Meteora and the Achilleion. In November the <b>main</b> <b>unit</b> moved to England, which included interior work in Pinewood, {{while the second}} unit shot underwater scenes in the Bahamas. On 1 January 1981 production moved to Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy, where filming wrapped in February. Many of the underwater scenes, especially involving close-ups of Bond and Melina, were shot on a dry soundstage. A combination of lighting effects, slow-motion photography, wind, and bubbles added in post-production, gave the illusion of the actors being underwater. The pre-credits sequence used a church in Stoke Poges as a cemetery, while scenes involving a helicopter were filmed at the abandoned Beckton Gas Works in London.|$|E

5|$|Quantum of Solace {{was shot}} in six countries. Second unit filming began in Italy at the Palio di Siena horse race on 16 August 2007, {{although}} at that point Forster was unsure how it would fit into the film. Some scenes were filmed also in Maratea and Craco, two small distinctive towns in Basilicata in southern Italy. Other places used for location shooting were Madrid in August 2007; Baja California, Mexico in early 2008, for shots of the aerial battle; Malcesine, Limone sul Garda and Tremosine in Italy during March, and at Talamone during the end of April. The <b>main</b> <b>unit</b> began on 3 January 2008 at Pinewood Studios. The 007 Stage {{was used for the}} fight in the art gallery, and an MI6 safehouse hidden within the city's cisterns, while other stages housed Bond's Bolivian hotel suite, and the MI6 headquarters. Interior and exterior airport scenes were filmed at Farnborough Airfield and the snowy closing scenes were filmed at the Bruneval Barracks in Aldershot.|$|E
5|$|The early Middle Ages were {{a period}} of climatic deterioration, with a drop in {{temperature}} {{and an increase in}} rainfall, resulting in more land becoming unproductive. Climate change had a major impact on agriculture in this period and terms emerged to describe different quantities of land. In the period c. 1150 to 1300, warm dry summers and less severe winters allowed cultivation at much greater heights above sea level and made land more productive. Arable farming grew significantly, but was still more common in low-lying areas than in high-lying areas such as the Highlands, Galloway and the Southern Uplands. The <b>main</b> <b>unit</b> of land measurement in Scotland was the ploughgate, also known as the davoch and in Lennox as the arachor. It may have measured about , divided into 4 raths. The average amount of land used by a husbandman in Scotland might have been around 26 acres.|$|E
5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>unit</b> {{began its}} work in August 1976 in Sardinia. Don McLaughlan, {{then head of}} public {{relations}} at Lotus Cars, heard that Eon were shopping for a new Bond car. He drove a prototype Lotus Esprit with all Lotus branding taped over, and parked it outside the Eon offices at Pinewood studios; on seeing the car Eon asked Lotus to borrow both of the prototypes for filming. Initial filming of the car chase sequence resulted in disappointing action sequences. While moving the car between shoots, Lotus test driver Roger Becker impressed with {{his handling of the}} car {{and for the rest of}} filming on Sardinia, Becker became the stunt driver.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the Allied landings, Morotai was defended by {{approximately}} 500 Japanese soldiers. The <b>main</b> <b>unit</b> was the 2nd Provisional Raiding Unit, which had gradually arrived on the island between 12–19 July 1944, to replace the 32nd Division's battalions when they were withdrawn. The 2nd Provisional Raiding Unit comprised four companies and was manned by Japanese officers and Formosan soldiers. Small elements of several other infantry, military police and support units were also present on the island. The 2nd Provisional Raiding Unit's commander, Major Takenobu Kawashima, deployed the unit in the south-west sector of the island and used the smaller units to establish lookout posts and detachments around Morotai's coastline. The largest of these outposts was on the island's north-east end at Cape Sopi, which consisted of about 100 men. The Japanese force was too small and widely dispersed to be able to mount an effective defense, so the 32nd Division ordered it to build dummy camps and use other deceptions in an attempt to trick the Allies into thinking that Morotai was strongly held.|$|E
5|$|By June 1945 around 550 Japanese {{military}} personnel were stationed on Labuan. The <b>main</b> <b>unit</b> {{on the island}} was the 371st Independent Infantry Battalion (almost in its entirety, save for one company located elsewhere) with a strength of around 350. This battalion formed part of the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade, which had arrived at Tawao in north-east Borneo from Japan in July 1944 with six infantry battalions. During early 1945 the brigade headquarters, 371st Independent Infantry Battalion and three other battalions marched across the island to assume responsibility for defending the Brunei Bay area. Many of the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade's soldiers fell sick during the march, and all four combat battalions were considerably below their authorised strength {{by the time they}} arrived at Brunei Bay. In June 1945 the 371st Independent Infantry Battalion was commanded by Captain Shichiro Okuyama. A detachment of about 50 men from the 111th Airfield Battalion was also on Labuan, along with around 150 men assigned to other small units. In line with Japanese doctrine, the Labuan garrison did not make preparations to contest the Allied landing force as it came ashore. Instead, it constructed defensive positions inland from the island's beaches. Documents captured by Australian soldiers during the fighting on Labuan indicated that Okuyama had instructions to attempt to withdraw his force from the island if the battle went against him.|$|E
5|$|M-149 is a rural two-lane {{highway that}} {{starts in the}} {{community}} of Thompson southwest of Manistique on Lake Michigan. It runs west-northwesterly through woodlands away from a junction with US2 along a small pond in the area. The road curves to the north and passes the cemetery and some small farms south of a crossing with a line of the Canadian National Railway. North of the tracks, the road meets County Road 442 (CR442) near Indian Lake. M-149 turns to the west at that junction while CR442 runs easterly to connect to the <b>main</b> <b>unit</b> of the Indian Lake State Park. The highway continues to a junction with CR455, which connects to the western unit of the state part, after which the trunkline turns to the northwest through forested terrain. The highway turns back to the west before intersecting another CR442 in the area. At this junction, M-149 turns to the north where it continues for several miles until curving eastward. M-149 intersects the northern end of CR455 and turns north once again until it terminates at the main gate to the Palms Book State Park, home of Kitch-iti-kipi (the Big Spring).|$|E

5|$|The second unit filmed {{part of the}} prologue's 1912 segment from August 29 to September 3. The <b>main</b> <b>unit</b> began {{two days}} later with the circus train {{sequence}} at Alamosa, Colorado, on the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad. They filmed at Pagosa Springs on September 7, and then at Cortez on September 10. From September 14 to16, filming of Indiana falling into the train carriages took place in Los Angeles. The production then moved to Utah's Arches National Park to shoot more of the opening. A house in Antonito, Colorado {{was used for the}} Jones family home. The production had intended to film at Mesa Verde National Park, but Native American representatives had religious objections to its use. When Spielberg and editor Michael Kahn viewed a rough cut of the film in late 1988, they felt it suffered from a lack of action. The motorcycle chase was shot during post-production at Mount Tamalpais and Fairfax near Skywalker Ranch. The closing shot of Indiana, Henry, Sallah and Brody riding into the sunset was filmed in Texas in early 1989.|$|E
5|$|To {{properly}} {{tell the}} international {{aspects of the}} story, filming for Sense8 took place almost entirely on location around the globe. In the first season they filmed in nine cities located in eight countries: Berlin, Chicago, London, Mexico City, Mumbai, Nairobi, Reykjavík, San Francisco, and Seoul. Production on the first season began on June 18, 2014 in San Francisco. The filmmakers successfully negotiated with {{the organizers of the}} Clarion Alley Mural Project and select artists to feature their artwork in the show. Shooting in Chicago began on July 9 and wrapped up on August 8, with filming taking place both on location and at the Cinespace Film Studios. They shot some scenes in the Superdawg drive-through restaurant, while customers were being asked not to stare at the filming. Lana and Lilly Wachowski are frequent customers of the place. During location scouting, the producers found the City Methodist Church in Gary, Indiana which is nearby Chicago, and changed one site's description in the scripts to a church accordingly in order to fit that particular site into the filming. They filmed in the church from July 25 to 28. Filming proceeded to London for a short shoot and then to Iceland, where between August 26 and September 6 they shot in Reykjavik and nearby places such as Akranes. Filming then started in Nairobi, where a sequence required a crowd of 700 extras, 200 cars and a helicopter. In Seoul they filmed from September 18 to 30. Next they moved to Mexico City and later to Germany, where they filmed in Berlin and inside Babelsberg Studio. Last place they visited was Mumbai where they also shot a Bollywood dance number that was choreographed by Slumdog Millionaires Longinus Fernandes. The writers wanted to feature an event in each city. They were able to schedule the Pride scenes with its Dykes on Bikes on the Dyke March in San Francisco, the Fourth of July fireworks celebration in Chicago, and the Ganesha Chaturthi Hindu festival in Mumbai. Additionally they recorded footage from the Fresh Meat Festival of transgender and queer performance in San Francisco, a club event taking place at the KOKO in London, and a real lucha libre (Mexican professional wrestling) event with the fighters wearing wrestling masks in Arena Naucalpan, in Mexico City. Lastly the scenes where characters are flying on an airplane were recorded during the real flights the cast and crew had to do to get from London to Iceland. On November 17, 2014 Straczynski wrote that the <b>main</b> <b>unit</b> shooting had wrapped, with only a few winter shots in Iceland remaining to be captured the next month. These scenes were further delayed to mid-January 2015, until Iceland had the necessary amount of snow, with the wrap party taking place in Reykjavík's Harpa Music and Concert hall on January 21. By the end of the shooting, the filmmakers had completed 100,000 miles of flight time, or four times around the globe.|$|E
