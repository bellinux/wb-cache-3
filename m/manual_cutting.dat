The quantities of cut-pieces produced by fabric-cutting departments based on these non-systematic schedules cannot fulfil the cut-piece requirements of the downstream sewing lines and minimize the makespan. This paper proposes a genetic algorithms (GAs) approach to optimize both the cut-piece requirements and the makespan of the conventional fabric-cutting departments using <b>manual</b> spreading and <b>cutting</b> methods.

Separate experiments involving <b>manual</b> <b>cuttings</b> of speckled alder (Alnus rugosa (Du Roi) Spreng.), red maple (Acer rubrum L.), and aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) employed a common suite of treatments and randomized complete block design with five replications. Treatments, applied between June 26 and 29, 1995, included two formulations, each combined with two fungus isolates, 2139 from British Columbia and JAM 6 from Ontario. Cutting only (no treatment) and stump treatments with triclopyr (Release®) and blank formulations were used as controls. Two growing seasons after treatment, triclopyr provided significantly greater control of target species than C. purpureum. The fungus exhibited its greatest efficacy on alder, resulting in a 72 % reduction in stem volume index and 19 % clump mortality over untreated controls. On red maple, isolate 2139 provided a 32 % reduction in the volume of stump sprouts. On aspen, both isolates of C. purpureum resulted in a 35 % reduction in the volume of stump sprouts and isolate 2139 provided an 88 % reduction in the volume of root suckers.

5000|$|A common {{method of}} {{threading}} is cutting with taps and dies. Unlike drill bits, hand taps do not automatically remove the chips they create. A hand tap cannot cut its threads {{in a single}} rotation because it creates long chips which quickly jam the tap (an effect known as [...] "crowding"), possibly breaking it. Therefore, in <b>manual</b> thread <b>cutting,</b> normal wrench usage is to cut the threads 1/2 to 2/3 of a turn (180 to 240 degree rotation), then reverse the tap for about 1/6 of a turn (60 degrees) until the chips are broken by the back edges of the cutters.

30|$|Comment: Another false choice, but {{the main}} {{problems}} here are: (a) <b>Manual</b> <b>cutting</b> is sometimes required by circumstance, but it is neither technically nor economically feasible to do the required thinning at adequate pace and scale with <b>manual</b> <b>cutting</b> alone or as the primary method. (b) The scale of open burning required by Ingalsbee’s proposal would produce amounts of smoke and additional hazards not acceptable to current populations, especially when much cleaner and safer disposal could be done if most of the material were made into lumber or burned in biomass power plants. (c) It is disingenuous to imply that herbicide use is the alternative to <b>manual</b> <b>cutting</b> and prescribed burning. Herbicides can’t remove existing fuel, they can only add dead vegetation to the fuel load, so neither mechanical nor manual thinning would likely need or use herbicides in the initial treatments. And for longer term maintenance of acceptable fuel loads, the same herbicide issues would arise whether those fuel loads were initially established by hand or machine methods.|$|E

In Central America, <b>manual</b> {{sugarcane}} <b>cutting</b> is exhausting work {{known to}} have a high metabolic load and to be associated with many occupational hazards including insect bites, snake bites, inhalation of particulate matter, pesticide exposure, physical violence and eye injuries resulting from a number of factors including sudden and repetitive body movements, intense work pace and extreme physical exertion. The main objective of this research was to evaluate the feasibility of acelerometer methodologies for upper limb postures and the calculation of metabolic rate from heartrate as an assessment of <b>manual</b> cane <b>cutting</b> during the pilot phase of the “Worker Health and Efficiency” (WE) program in El Salvador. This was done through 1) a description of relevant working conditions for the use of assessment methodologies or designing experiments in cane cutters during the WE program; 2) analysis of accelerometers to determine positions of the upper extremity work of cane cutters and 3) evaluation of a methodology for determining metabolic rate from the heart rate measurement. The WE Program includes, among other components: water supply through use of water “backpacks”, programed breaks in the shade during the shift, supervised food (lunch) and replacing the cutting technique with a methodology used in Australia. A total of 52 people were observed, of which 12 were evaluated for working postures. Of these, 8 were part of the posture sample together with 42 other workers. A description of working conditions included clothing, footwear, personal protective equipment, transport, rest, water, and land conditions. Given the high loss of accelerometer data, {{it was not possible to}} complete the analysis of postures. However, the data obtained is reported to guide the next steps of the project. According to data obtained, personal factors (examples: fitness, productivity) or environmental (examples: soil type, growth parameters cane, high temperature) may be affecting the metabolic rate of workers, possibly explaining or producing considerable variation in metabolic rates in the task of cutting sugarcane. The qualitative description of working conditions was insufficient to create exposure indicators. Heartrate measurements taken with pulsometers for estimating metabolic rate may be an appropriate technique given the working conditions. Finally, specific changes are recommended for experimental design and data collection protocol for the estimation of working postures using the accelerometer methodology.

To {{investigate}} {{the structure and}} irregularity of the capsulotomy cutting edges created by two femtosecond (FS) laser platforms in comparison with manual continuous circular capsulorhexis (CCC) using environmental scanning electron microscopy (eSEM). Methods. Ten anterior capsulotomies were obtained using two different FS laser cataract platforms (LenSx, n= 5, and Victus, n= 5). In addition, five manual CCC (n= 5) were obtained using a rhexis forceps. The specimens were imaged by eSEM (FEI Quanta 400, OR, USA). Objective metrics, which included the arithmetic mean deviation of the surface (Sa) and the root-mean-square deviation of the surface (Sq), were {{used to evaluate the}} irregularity of both the FS laser capsulotomies and the <b>manual</b> CCC <b>cutting</b> edges.

Work is needed to understand whether the FS laser capsulotomy edge microirregularities, not seen in manual CCC, may act as focal points for the concentration of stress that would increase the risk of capsular tear during phacoemulsification as recently reported in the literature...|$|R
