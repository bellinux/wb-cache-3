40|$|Abstract: Santalum lanceolatum, the {{commercial}} species of sandalwood harvested in Queensland, was worth $ 4. 2 million in export earnings in 1988. The {{ecology of the}} species in natural forests is summarized, and information on seedling regeneration and coppice and root suckering strategies is provided. Stand characteristics and size class distribution in two different environments in northwest Queensland are provided. It is important to manage the resource for conservation. The harvesting guidelines, pricing criteria, and procedures are discussed along with information on heartwood recovery and moisture content of harvested sandalwood. Future research should be undertaken to <b>monitor</b> <b>stand</b> dynamics, growth rates, {{and the effects of}} land use practices on the distribution, growth, and dynamics of sandalwood in natural stands. The trade in this fragrant wood has been going on since the dawn of history and will probably not cease until the connection between santal trees and idolators existing from time immorial, shall have been broken up, by either the one or the other becoming as extinct a race as the Archaepteryx or the Dodo.

According to Schwenke (1978, p. 228), the main reasons for pupal mortality are dehydration, flooding and predators. As flooding can be largely excluded at the <b>monitoring</b> <b>stands,</b> the mortality by dehydration offers a plausible explanation for the described covariate’s effect. Influence by predatory enemies and epizootic disease could not be investigated in this study, but they can reduce the population of MUWM considerably, especially in pupal stage (Dempster 1983; Berryman 1996; Hunter 1998).|$|R

40|$|In {{uneven-aged}} conifer-broadleaved mixed {{forests in}} Hokkaido, northern Japan, single-tree selection cutting {{has been a}} common management practice since the early twentieth century.

Our simulations, based on demographic data from 15 long-term <b>monitoring</b> <b>stands,</b> suggest that selection cutting using a lower cutting intensity together with a longer rotation period and reduced removal of small trees and conifer species is more appropriate than traditional systems in terms of maintaining stand structure and tree species composition, {{as well as being}} profitable financially.

We <b>monitored</b> <b>stand</b> evapo-transpiration by eddy-covariance (E), tree transpiration (T) by heat-dissipative sapflow, soil (G) and stand (J) heat storage during 3 years in a typical coconut palm row-plantation of the humid tropics, displaying a constant leaf area index (LAI = 3) and a grass under-storey. A two-level flux experiment yielded cross-validation of the evapo-transpiration of the under-storey (Eu) with E − T, through energy balance closure for E and sapflow calibration in the laboratory for T. On a yearly time step, E represented 40 % of rainfall, the sensible heat flux (H) was 26 % of net radiation and the Bowen ratio was 0. 39, all indicating that water availability was close-to-optimum. T represented 68 % of E, close to the 75 % of soil coverage by palms. The inter-annual variability was low for potential evapo-transpiration (ETo), energy and water fluxes. The seasonal variability was more pronounced, driven by radiation and vapour pressure deficit (VPD). The canopy conductance of coconut palms appeared to be strongly controlled by VPD.

40|$|Past {{land use}} change has {{converted}} vast areas of Northern peatland by drainage to agricultural or forested land. This change often reduces the greenhouse gas (GHG) sink strength of peatlands or turns them even from sinks to sources, which affects the global climate. Therefore, {{there is a}} need for suitable mitigation options for GHG emissions from drained peatlands. Addition of wood ash to peatland forests has been suggested as such a measure, but the overall effect on the global warming potential (GWP) of these ecosystems is still unclear. In order to fill this knowledge gap, we investigated three drained peatland forests in Sweden that had been fertilized with wood ash and <b>monitored</b> <b>stand</b> growth as well as the GHG emissions from soil, i. e. net effluxes of carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Our results show that over the first five to eight years after wood ash application, tree growth was enhanced at all sites. This was accompanied by generally little changes in the GHG emissions. Overall, we found that wood ash application reduced the GWP of drained peatland forests. Even though that our study was limited to eight years after wood ash application, we can conclude that in the short term wood ash application may be a suitable mitigation option for GHG emissions from Northern drained peatland forests...|$|R

40|$|Phenological {{variables}} {{derived from}} remote sensing {{are useful in}} determining the seasonal cycles of ecosystems in a changing climate. Satellite remote sensing imagery is useful for the spatial continuous monitoring of vegetation phenology across broad regions; however, its applications are substantially constrained by atmospheric disturbances such as clouds, dusts, and aerosols. By way of contrast, a tower-based ground remote sensing approach at the canopy level can provide continuous information on canopy phenology at finer spatial and temporal scales, regardless of atmospheric conditions. In this study, a tower-based ground remote sensing system, called the “Phenological Eyes Network (PEN) ”, which was installed at the Gwangneung Deciduous KoFlux (GDK) flux tower site in Korea was introduced, and daily phenological progressions at the canopy level were assessed using ratios of red, green, and blue (RGB) spectral reflectances obtained by the PEN system. The PEN system at the GDK site consists of an automatic-capturing digital fisheye camera and a hemi-spherical spectroradiometer, and <b>monitors</b> <b>stand</b> canopy phenology on an hourly basis. RGB data analyses conducted between late March and early December in 2009 revealed that the 2 G_RB (i. e., 2 G - R - B) index was lower than the G/R (i. e., G divided by R) index during the off-growing season, owing {{to the effects of}} surface reflectance, including soil and snow effects. The results of comparisons between the daily PEN-obtained RGB ratios and daily moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) -driven vegetation indices demonstrate that ground remote sensing data, including the PEN data, can help to improve cloud-contaminated satellite remote sensing imagery...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{bachelor}} thesis was to perform literary research {{on the topic of}} the productivity of individual wood logging methods for forest cover and verify this productivity by comparison of the time dimensions either by using the harvester or working with the woodcutters. The main contribution of the thesis research results are own measurement. Measuring of the productivity of individual wood logging methods was carried out in the conditions given by the method cut to length by salvage cutting, that launched because of hit by bark beetle or strong wind. The measurement was carried out on five stands with harvester and on two stands with woodcutters. It was a measure of one harvester operator and four woodcutters. The measurement was done with the help of cameras that caught the working times of woodcutters and the harvester. The resulting times, due to the productivity and stem volume of the trees, recorded times by harvester were better and for that reason that method had proven to be more effective. In one of the <b>monitored</b> <b>stands</b> the effectiveness has not been demonstrated, because the operator has not logged in this forest cover enough m 3 of the wood and the work was, therefore, loss making and time consuming. By the work of the woodcutters has the efficiency and shorter working times showed in two stands, where the measurement was carried out. Their productivity has been effective there, for example, with regard to the low number of trees and the larger crop density, the harvester technology would not be efficient...|$|R

The suspension of harvesting following the crisis of fuel wood market ruled the evolutive pattern of maquis over the last decades. In this phase, site quality {{seems to be the}} major driver of the holm oak-dominated forest recovery {{as well as of the}} lasting permanence of the sclerophyllous shrub forest. In this connection, stand dynamics has been monitored in three plots located in the strictly protected area of the &# 8220;Parco Regionale della Maremma&# 8221; (Grosseto - Tuscany), where natural evolution is in progress since at least five decades. The <b>monitored</b> <b>stands</b> are representative of different evolutive phases from the holm oak-dominated coppices to the typical maquis, as a function of the original stand structure and composition but also of the intensity and length of the applied coppice management system. The analysis was carried out by permanent transects; two inventories were undertaken in 1991 and 2006 to evaluate both compositional and structural variability and the dynamics in progress. Results at now highlight the role played by the residual site quality and specific composition in driving the evolutive pattern of tree species community. Under the absence of any silvicultural practice and better site conditions, the progress and specific incidence of regular mortality and the related aboveground biomass redistribution, supported the vegetation of holm oak and the other subsidiary species typical of more mature stages.

30|$|The model allows {{analyses}} of the joint regional and temporal population dynamics of MUWM because it describes these patterns by explicit effects. However, due to limitations of the data base, the spatial component could only be specified in a very simple way via three ecoregions. In contrast, the temporal dynamic is flexibly modelled via smooth effects of the monitoring year specified {{for each of the}} ecoregions (temporally structured effect). Unstructured spatial effects are modelled via random effects on stand level. This is a very simple way to allow for stand specific differences in the cyclic dynamics, since only the level but not the temporal pattern is allowed to vary between stands within one ecoregion. Due to these limitations, and even if two time-varying and stand specific weather covariates are integrated into the final model, the residuals show some temporal autocorrelation on stand level. A check of temporal autocorrelation within stands revealed that especially the measurements of two successive years are positively autocorrelated. Presumably, only the implementation of a temporal structured effect for each <b>monitoring</b> <b>stand</b> would eliminate all temporal autocorrelation. This would, however, require more time-series data than were available. A complex large scale spatio-temporal effect (Augustin et al. 2009) was not modelled since the spatial coverage for most observational years is rather weak. Moreover, several data originate from seriously affected stands and from time periods of higher moth abundance, as the inventory is a legal preliminary for any pest control application. This causes a positive bias (overestimation), in space and time, of the overall abundance level, which has to be considered in the interpretation of results. As explanatory variables are collected independently of this sampling scheme, however, estimated effects of predictors and patterns of population dynamics can be estimated without bias and with greater accuracy of estimate per observation (King and Zeng 2001) in comparison to a fully random sampling design.|$|R
40|$|Second-growth {{tropical}} forests {{are an important}} global carbon sink. As current knowledge on biomass accumulation during secondary succession is heavily based on chronosequence studies, direct estimates of annual rates of biomass accumulation in <b>monitored</b> <b>stands</b> are largely unavailable. We evaluated the contributions of tree diameter increment, recruitment, and mortality to annual tree biomass change during succession for three groups of tree species: Second-growth (SG) specialists, generalists, and old-growth (OG) specialists. We monitored six second-growth {{tropical forests}} that varied in stand age and two old-growth forests in northeastern Costa Rica. We monitored these {{over a period of}} 8 to 16 years. To assess rates of biomass change during secondary succession, we compared standing biomass and biomass dynamics between second-growth forest stages and old-growth forest, and evaluated the effect of stand age on standing biomass and biomass dynamics in secondgrowth forests. Standing tree biomass increased with stand age during succession, whereas the rate of biomass change decreased. Biomass change was largely driven by tree diameter increment and mortality, with a minor contribution from recruitment. The relative importance of these demographic drivers shifted over succession. Biomass gain due to tree diameter increment decreased with stand age, whereas biomass loss due to mortality increased. In the age range of our second-growth forests, 10 - 41 years, SG specialists dominated tree biomass in secondgrowth forests. SG specialists, {{and to a lesser extent}} generalists, also dominated stand-level biomass increase due to tree diameter increment, whereas SG specialists largely accounted for decreases in biomass due to mortality. Our results indicate that tree growth is largely driving biomass dynamics early in succession, whereas both growth and mortality are important later in succession. Biomass dynamics are largely accounted for by a few SG specialists and one generalist species, Pentaclethra macroloba. To assess the generality of our results, similar long-term studies should be compared across tropical forest landscapes. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America...|$|R
