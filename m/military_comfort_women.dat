5000|$|Until {{the early}} 1990s, the term Wianbu ( [...] , [...] "Comfort Women") was often used by South Korean media and {{officials}} {{to refer to}} prostitutes for the U.S. <b>military,</b> but <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> was also the euphemism used for the sex slaves for the Imperial Japanese Army, {{and in order to}} avoid confusions, the term yanggongju replaced wianbu to refer to sexual laborers for the U.S. military. The early 1990s also saw the two women's rights movements diverge: on one side the one representing the Cheongsindae (<b>Comfort</b> <b>women</b> for the Japanese military), {{and on the other side}} the movement representing the Gijichon (Camptown for the US military), even if some women happen to have been victims of forced labor on both sides.

5000|$|According to {{anthropologist}} Chunghee Sarah Soh, the South Korean <b>military's</b> use of <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> {{has produced}} [...] "virtually no societal response," [...] despite the country's women's movement's support for Korean <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> within the Japanese military. Both Kim and Soh {{argue that this}} system is a legacy of Japanese colonialism, as many of Korea's army leadership were trained by the Japanese military. Both the Korean and Japanese militaries referred to these <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> as [...] "military supplies" [...] in official documents and personal memoirs. The South Korean armed forces also used the same arguments as the Japanese military to justify the use of <b>comfort</b> <b>women,</b> viewing them as a [...] "necessary social evil" [...] that would raise soldiers' morale and prevent rape.|$|R
50|$|Kakou Senda (August 28, 1924 - December 22, 2000) was a Japanese {{writer who}} is known for writing one of the first books on comfort women in Japan. Born in Dalian, Kwantung Leased Territory (then part of the Empire of Japan) he wrote <b>Military</b> <b>Comfort</b> <b>Women</b> (Jūgun-ianfu) in 1973.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{his book}} <b>Military</b> <b>Comfort</b> <b>Women</b> was a [...] "hidden" [...] best-seller among scholars, {{it did not}} gain {{widespread}} public attention. Soon after his book was published, it was quickly made into a film by Toei Company. Even the film did not draw {{much attention to the}} issue of comfort women. The comfort women issue only gained international attention when Kim Hak-sun came forth with her story in 1991.|$|E
50|$|As a {{reporter}} for Mainichi Shinbun (a major newspaper in Japan), Kakou Senda first encountered photographs of comfort women in 1962 while working on Nihon no Senreki, a book that chronicled photographs from World War II. The photograph had been among a collection of 25,000 censored wartime photographs. The explanations connected with the pictures did not explain who these women were. When Senda pursued further investigation, he learned of the jūgun-ianfu for the first time, leading him to investigate the comfort system as a whole. Senda faced difficulties in finding people willing to share information regarding the comfort women until he met Aso Tetsuo, a former army doctor. During the war, Aso Tetsuo had examined the women for venereal disease and not surprisingly, proclaimed the young Korean girls to be much healthier than the Japanese prostitutes. Based his research of soldier-comfort women ratios, Senda estimated that there that number of comfort women was over 100,000. Drawing on interviews with Japanese military veterans, Korean men, and others in addition to relevant publications, Senda published his book <b>Military</b> <b>Comfort</b> <b>Women</b> (Jūgun-ianfu) in 1973. Through {{the introduction of a}} fellow journalist, Senda was able to meet a former comfort woman but when asked the details of her experience, she remained silent.|$|E

50|$|The {{legacy of}} the colonial period of Korean history {{continues}} to fuel recriminations and demands for restitution in both Koreas. North and South Korea have both lodged severe protests against visits by Japanese officials to the Yasukuni Shrine, which is seen as glorifying the Class A war criminals whose remains are held there. Some Koreans claim {{that a number of}} Korean women who worked near Japanese <b>military</b> bases as <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> were forced to serve as sex slaves against their will for Japanese soldiers during World War II which is a persistent thorn in the side of Japan-Korea relations since the 1990s. Disagreements over demands for reparations and a formal apology still remain unresolved despite the previous agreement and compensation in 1965, Koreans started peaceful vigils in 1992 held by survivors on a weekly basis. Recent Japanese history textbook controversies have emerged {{as a result of what}} some see as an attempt at historical revisionism with the aim of whitewashing or ignoring Japan's war crimes during World War II. These issues continue to separate the two countries diplomatically, and provide fuel for nationalism in both Koreas as well as anti-Japanese sentiment.|$|R

40|$|Comfort women" is a euphemistic term {{referring}} {{to women and}} girls who were sent to serve the Japanese military in locations throughout Asia. The existence of military comfort stations have been confirmed in China, Hong Kong, French Indochina, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, British Bomeo, the Dutch East Indies, Burma, Thailand, New Guinea (in the eastern Pacific), the Okinawan archipelago, the Bonin Islands, Hokkaido, the Kurile Islands, and Sakhalin. The establishment of these stations followed Japanese troops wherever they were based (Yoshimi 2000). <b>Military</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> were systematically recruited {{during the period from}} 1937 to 1945 to "serve the sexual 'needs' of Japanese military during the Asia Pacific war" (Yoshimi 2000 : 29). These women and girls were restrained by the Japanese military, afforded no rights, and forced to have sex with military personnel. Comfort women were subjected to inhumane and unsanitary conditions and were forced, in some cases, to "serve several tens of soldiers every day" (Ueno 2004 :ix) ...|$|E
40|$|A History to Open the Future is {{the first}} history book, {{published}} in 2005, to be jointly authored by scholars, teachers, and history activists from China, Japan, and South Korea, and created {{to be used as}} a teaching guide for supplementing history lessons on topics ranging from the start of Japanese imperialism, to the end of the Pacific War. A History to Open the Future was created in response to the controversy surrounding the New History Textbook authorized for use in middle schools in Japan in 2001, in which topics such as <b>military</b> <b>Comfort</b> <b>Women</b> and Japanese aggression during the Pacific War were omitted and distorted. A History to Open the Future seeks to overcome said controversy by presenting such contentious topics in Northeast Asia from a perspective of shared history in the region, with the goal of instilling reconciliation and peace in the region. This thesis seeks to understand how the authors, who represent countries with very different and sometimes competing memories of history, came together to create Northeast Asia’s first joint history book and what obstacles existed in that process. Furthermore, this thesis also seeks to discover the possibilities of using such a book in schools in the region. These two research question are answered with data collected from interviews conducted with the authors of the book and teachers in Japan and South Korea. In doing so, this research seeks to shed new light on the history problems plaguing Northeast Asian relations, and provide information on how joint history book may lead to reconciliation in the future...|$|E

5000|$|Professor An Byeong-jik {{translated}} the diary into modern Korean {{and had it}} published in August 2013. Researchers have hailed the diary as a crucial source {{of information on the}} workings of Japan's <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> system. It is the only known contemporary account of the <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> system written by a brothel manager. According to Kan Kimura, the diary is [...] "highly credible", noting that Mr. Park died before the <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> issue became a source of tension between Japan and South Korea. The <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> issue did not become a significant international problem until 1990 when a group of former Korean <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> asked for an apology and compensation from the Japanese government.|$|R

5000|$|Concerning the {{controversy}} over whether the <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> should be described as [...] "sex slaves", Choi Kilsong notes that the diary refers to the <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> only as [...] "barmaids" [...] or [...] "workwomen". They were treated by the military as ordinary employees of the brothel and were in many cases permitted to quit their jobs at their request. Choi believes that the <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> were not sex slaves, but rather were more similar to the karayuki-san, Japanese prostitutes who plied their trade abroad. By contrast, Professor An points to a diary entry showing that the <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> were forced to transfer to new work sites along with the Japanese Army regardless of their own wishes, and to one entry which states that two <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> in Burma attempted to quit their jobs and return home but were forced by the Japanese military to continue working. An concludes that [...] "sexual slavery" [...] is a reasonable description of the <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> system.|$|R

5000|$|Park’s book <b>Comfort</b> <b>women</b> of the Empire {{contains}} a significantly different narrative about <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> {{compared to the}} previously accepted narratives, as it describes in depth of the imperialistic exploits by Japan, patriarchal system in Korea and also capitalistic exploits of the [...] "dealers". This explanation brought fierce anger from the <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> supporters, since her explanation were analyzed as [...] "virtually an exoneration to Japan" [...] from the critics. She was sued by nine <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> who had filed from Nanume-Jip (나눔의 집) and paid 10 million won, or $8,262, to each of nine women. She was also accused by Korean prosecutor.

25|$|During World War II, about 450,000 Korean male laborers were involuntarily sent to Japan. <b>Comfort</b> <b>women,</b> {{who served}} in Japanese {{military}} brothels {{as a form of}} sexual slavery, came from all over the Japanese empire. They numbered somewhere from 10,000 to 200,000, and they included an unknown number of Koreans. However, 200,000 {{is considered to be a}} conservative number by modern historians, and up to 500,000 <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> are estimated to be taken. These women faced an average of 29 men and up to 40 men per day, according to one surviving <b>comfort</b> <b>woman.</b> However, of the 500,000, less than 50 are alive today. <b>Comfort</b> <b>women</b> were often recruited from rural locales with the promise of factory employment; business records, often from Korean subcontractees of Japanese companies, showed them falsely classified as nurses or secretaries. There is evidence that the Japanese government intentionally destroyed official records regarding <b>comfort</b> <b>women.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Mark E. Caprio, a {{professor}} of history at Rikkyo University in Tokyo, wrote that Soh's book emphasizes the complexity of the <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> issue. The book describes how there are vastly different experiences of <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> depending on how they were recruited and where they were stationed. Soh works toward a more comprehensive definition of <b>comfort</b> <b>women,</b> rather than limiting the definition to a single characterization. Caprio criticizes Soh for opening the door to Japanese nationalists who make [...] "irresponsible claims" [...] to minimize the <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> issue. Caprio says that Soh's book supports some of the arguments used by nationalists, and that it does not spend enough effort on refutation of the nationalist position.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} is {{an analysis of}} the South Korean response to Korean women who were trafficked for the purpose of sexual slavery to the Japanese Imperial army during the Second World War. The research utilizes Bacchi’s analytical tool: ‘What’s the problem represented to be?’. A critical analysis of key South Korean policies pertaining to <b>Comfort</b> <b>Women</b> was prompted by an awareness of observed discrepancies in the support provided to trafficked people in Australia and South Korea. Exploring the history of responses to the <b>Comfort</b> <b>Women</b> and their current situation is conducted with a particular focus on the South Korean government’s policy and legislative responses. This also provides a background to how South Korea positions itself in relation to the still very vocal <b>Comfort</b> <b>Women</b> movement. Diverse discussions centering on sex trafficking in an international context and postcolonial feminist ideas in relation to the <b>Comfort</b> <b>Women</b> system are assessed to develop an explanatory platform for the critical analysis. This research revealed that the South Korean government has positioned itself in the role of a welfare provider in addressing the <b>Comfort</b> <b>Women</b> issues leaving a significant gap in policy responses to the political and social positioning of the <b>Comfort</b> <b>Women.</b> Key words: <b>Comfort</b> <b>Women,</b> South Korean social policy, The Japanese Military Sexual Slavery, Post-colonialism, Carol BacchiAccess is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney.
