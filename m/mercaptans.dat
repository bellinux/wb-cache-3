25|$|In {{this form}} {{it is often}} mixed with small amounts of {{hydrogen}} sulfide and <b>mercaptans</b> which will give the unburned gas an offensive smell easily detected by the human nose. In this way, butane leaks can easily be identified. While hydrogen sulfide and <b>mercaptans</b> are toxic, they are present in levels so low that suffocation and fire hazard by the butane becomes a concern far before toxicity. Most commercially available butane also contains {{a certain amount of}} contaminant oil which can be removed through filtration but which will otherwise leave a deposit at the point of ignition and may eventually block the uniform flow of gas. Contaminants are not used in fragrance extraction and butane gasses can cause gas explosions in poorly ventilated areas if leaks go unnoticed and are ignited by spark or flame.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is {{generally}} {{thought to be}} a metabolic by-product of yeast fermentation in nitrogen limited environments.

25|$|Hydrogen sulfide– Often {{produced}} by yeast during fermentation {{because of a}} nitrogen deficiency in the must. This {{can be done by}} a reduction of sulfates or sulfites available in the must or by the decomposition of dead yeast cells by other yeast that releases sulfur-containing amino acids that are further broken down by the yeast. The latter often happens with wines that sit in contact with their lees {{for long periods of time}} between rackings. In the presence of alcohol, hydrogen sulfide can react with ethanol to form ethyl <b>mercaptans</b> and disulfides that contribute to off aromas and wine faults. Some commercial yeast strains, such as Montrachet 522 are known to produce higher levels of hydrogen sulfides than other strains, particularly if the must has some nutrient deficiencies.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} leaving the wine to spend some contact with the lees {{has a long history}} in winemaking, being known to the Ancient Romans and {{described}} by Cato the Elder in the 2nd century BC. Today the practice is widely associated with any red wines that are barrel fermented, Muscadet, sparkling wine Champagne as well as Chardonnay produced in many wine regions across the globe. Typically when wines are left in contact with their lees, they are regularly stirred in order to release the mannoproteins, polysaccharides and other compounds that were present in the yeast cell walls and membranes. This stirring also helps avoid the development of reductive sulfur compounds like <b>mercaptans</b> and hydrogen sulfide that can appear if the lees layer is more than 10cm (4inches) thick and undisturbed for more than a week.|$|E
2500|$|Poor quality {{crude oil}} {{can be treated}} with sodium {{hydroxide}} to remove sulfurous impurities in {{a process known as}} caustic washing. As above, sodium hydroxide reacts with weak acids such as hydrogen sulfide and <b>mercaptans</b> to yield non-volatile sodium salts, which can be removed. The waste which is formed is toxic and difficult to deal with, and the process is banned in many countries because of this. In 2006, Trafigura used the process and then dumped the waste in Africa.|$|E

2500|$|The {{recovered}} NGL {{stream is}} sometimes processed through a fractionation train consisting of three distillation towers in series: a deethanizer, a depropanizer and a debutanizer. The overhead product from the deethanizer is ethane and the bottoms are fed to the depropanizer. The overhead product from the depropanizer is propane and the bottoms are fed to the debutanizer. The overhead product from the debutanizer {{is a mixture}} of normal and iso-butane, and the bottoms product is a C5+ mixture. The recovered streams of propane, butanes and C5+ may be [...] "sweetened" [...] in a Merox process unit to convert undesirable <b>mercaptans</b> into disulfides and, along with the recovered ethane, are the final NGL by-products from the gas processing plant. Currently, most cryogenic plants do not include fractionation for economic reasons, and the NGL stream is instead transported as a mixed product to standalone fractionation complexes located near refineries or chemical plants that use the components for feedstock. In case laying pipeline is not possible for geographical reason,or the distance between source and consumer exceed 3000km, natural gas is then transported by ship as LNG (liquefied natural gas) and again converted into its gaseous state {{in the vicinity of the}} consumer.|$|E
