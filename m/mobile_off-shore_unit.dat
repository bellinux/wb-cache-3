40|$|AbstractAccording {{to growing}} {{of demand for}} natural gas in global markets, it causes to modify and intensify its process. Indisputably, the existance of water in natural gas has so long been a {{controversial}} issue in gas industry and removing water from NG becomes a big deal, indeed. Gas dehydration is the most essntial and important way {{to solve this problem}} and there are several approaches to attain this aim. Among these methods, dehydration of natural gas with supersonic nozzle is an effictive method which is more efficient way than other methods. The main advantages of this method are its small size that is big deal for <b>off-shore</b> <b>units</b> because of limitation of location and also low operating costs with no deleterious environmental impact. In this study at first we examined some important methods for gas dehydration and then we proceed the details of supersonic nozzle method, and finally we compare it with other methods and conclude its unique advantages as abest method for gas dehydration. *Author for correspondenc...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine how {{companies}} should off‐shore complex product related tasks to low‐cost countries, without jeopardizing their competitive advantage and intellectual property, while building solid and sustainable business in the sourcing country. Design/methodology/approach – The underlying case concerns a multinational, globally operating engineering company delivering complex system products used as part of industrial and social infrastructure, and its entry to off‐shoring and how it has evolved from a green field operation to sizeable value center over the past six years. Findings – The case provides support to the fact that companies understanding that building permanent, knowledge‐based and proprietary presence with full product management responsibility in lower labor cost countries will be more responsive in serving customers, cost efficient in maintaining old infrastructure products and in delivering new ones in the future. Further, complex product business companies focusing on long term and knowledge based legacy building in emerging economies will develop, not only more robust global business platform for themselves, but they will also contribute to the sustainable development of the global economy. Originality/value – The paper presents unique descriptive data on the overall outsourcing strategy of a global engineering company and how one of its <b>off‐shoring</b> <b>units</b> has evolved over time since its inception...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{conditions}} for the recognition and establishment of branches, agencies, <b>off-shore</b> <b>units</b> and subsidiaries of foreign public companies limited by shares in Greece. The relevant Greek laws are analysed in the first chapter, whereas chapter two {{deals with the}} comparative analysis of the Greek regime with the relevant provisions of EC law. In the third chapter (which {{is of particular interest}} {{due to the lack of}} relevant bibliography) reference is made to special Greek laws, that impose limitations on the activities of foreign companies in Greece, thus hindering their free establishment. Chapter four is devoted to the presentation of Greek law on the establishment of foreign maritime companies and the comparative analysis of the Greek regime with the regulations of the Treaty of Rome on this sphere. This analysis was considered necessary due to the vital importance of maritime companies and trade for the Greek economy and the particularly restrictive Greek regime on the establishment of foreign companies. Having concluded that Greek law violates the relevant EC regulations, an attempt is made to provide answers to the following questions: why did the EC fail to enforce its regulations in Greece and what is the protection offered to foreign companies that are prohibited from establishing there. The results of the thesis justify this research. Greece does not comply with EC law on the establishment of foreign companies. Furthermore, the enforcement of EC law in Greece seems impossible both on a Community and a national level. I only hope that the publication of more relevant analyses on the laws of member states will persuade the respective EC and national authorities that the passing of EC legislation does not suffice for the unification of Europe and the successful realization of the European ideal...|$|R

This study of 30 of the largest listed companies in Norway over the 2000 to 2006 period shows that foreign located divisional headquarters have become relatively commonplace. A majority of DHQs located abroad are outcomes of foreign acquisitions, which suggests that obtaining legitimacy from local stakeholders such as customers, employees and investors is an important motivation. We also find that Norwegian companies emphasize efficiency and value creation in their location choices, as they tend to prefer other advanced and competitive countries as hosts for their DHQs. Distance form Norway is not significant. The <b>off-shoring</b> of strategic <b>units</b> such as DHQs is a phenomenon that occurs in advanced phases of companies’ internationalization, beyond the point when familiarity and proximity still are key decision-making factors...|$|R
