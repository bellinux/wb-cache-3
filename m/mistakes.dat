5|$|In Herring v. United States, , Ginsburg dissented to the Court's {{decision}} not to suppress evidence due to a police officer's failure to update a computer system. In contrast to Justice Roberts' emphasis on suppression {{as a means to}} deter police misconduct, Ginsburg took a more robust view on the use of suppression as a remedy for a violation of a defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. Ginsburg viewed suppression as a way to prevent the government from profiting from <b>mistakes,</b> and therefore as a remedy to preserve judicial integrity and respect civil rights. She also rejected Roberts' assertion that suppression would not deter <b>mistakes,</b> contending making police pay a high price for <b>mistakes</b> would encourage them to take greater care.|$|E

The thesis applies to the legislation of <b>mistake</b> in relation to contracts in general as provided in the civil code, s. 583 - 585 and analyzes the legal consequences made by <b>mistake.</b> The keyword - <b>mistake</b> - is defined in the text in two ways - firstly as discrepancy between the genuine will of the acting person and manifestation of the will, secondly as a defect of the will.
