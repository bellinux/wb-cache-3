Performance depends {{to a great}} extent on the structure of the filler, i. e. its dispersion state in the polymer matrix, which itself depends on mixing protocols, but also on the thermodynamics of the system. The latter can be tuned by performing either chemical surface modifications of the nanoparticles, or by playing with the mass and/or grafting properties of the polymer chains. Some straightforward ways to obtain information from small-angle scattering on the filler structure of nanocomposites will be presented.

40|$|Master of ScienceAgronomyGuihua BaiGuorong ZhangFusarium {{head blight}} (FHB) {{is one of}} the most {{damaging}} diseases in wheat, which impacts both grain yield and quality drastically. Recently, the disease has become more prevalent in the hard winter wheat (HWW) grown areas of the United States including Oklahoma where FHB has not been reported before. Growing resistant cultivars is the most economical and effective strategy for disease management. To dissect quantitative trait loci (QTL) for FHB resistance in a <b>moderately</b> resistant <b>hard</b> winter wheat (HWW) cultivar, Overland, a population of 186 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed from the cross between Overland and Overley, a susceptible HWW cultivar from Kansas. The RILs were evaluated for FHB type II resistance in one field and three greenhouse experiments and genotyped using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) markers. Three FHB resistance QTLs were mapped on Chromosomes 4 DL, 4 AL, and 5 BL. The QTL on 4 DL was the most consistent one and explained up to 13 % of the phenotypic variation for type II resistance and 14 % for low Fusarium damaged kernels (FDK). Two GBS markers closely linked to the 4 DL QTL were successfully converted to Kbioscience competitive allelic specific PCR (KASP) assays and can be used in marker-assisted breeding. In breeding, a single QTL may provide only partial resistance and pyramiding of several resistance QTLs in a cultivar can provide more protection in FHB epidemics. Fhb 1 is a major QTL for FHB resistance from a Chinese source and Fhb 3 is an alien gene from wild rye grass (Leymus racemosus). To study the effects of these QTLs individually and cumulatively in hard winter wheat backgrounds, they were transferred into two HWW cultivars Overland and Jagger. The results show that Fhb 1 significantly increased FHB resistance, but Fhb 3 did not. Thus, Fhb 3 is not an effective gene for improvement of FHB resistance in HWW...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceAgronomyAllan FritzFusarium {{head blight}} (FHB) is a fungal disease, mostly {{commonly}} associated with F. graminearum, which affects cereal crops such as wheat resulting in substantial yield losses and reductions in grain quality. The onset of the disease can occur rapidly when warm, wet or humid weather coincides with flowering in the spring. The pathogen also produces mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON) that accumulate in the grain and can be toxic to humans and animals. This results in additional economic losses as contaminated grain must be discarded or blended {{to reduce the amount}} of toxin in order to meet federal regulatory limits. Development and deployment of resistant cultivars has proved to be an effective method to combat the disease, and many resistant sources have been reported in the literature with the majority of major resistance coming from Chinese landraces. Transferring resistance from these sources into cultivars adapted to the U. S. has been a slow process due to linkage of FHB resistance genes with poor agronomic traits. Therefore, it is important for breeders to search for sources of resistance in native material adapted to their local conditions. In this study, we aimed to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to spread of FHB within the head (Type II resistance), accumulation of DON toxin in grain (Type III resistance), and resistance to kernel infection (Type IV resistance). Plant material consisted of 148 doubled haploid (DH) lines from a cross between the two <b>moderately</b> resistant <b>hard</b> red winter wheat (HRWW) cultivars Art and Everest. The study was conducted for two years using a point inoculation technique in a greenhouse in Manhattan, KS. Three QTL conferring resistance to FHB traits were detected on chromosomes 2 D, 4 B, and 4 D. The QTL on chromosomes 4 B and 4 D overlapped with the major height genes Rht 1 and Rht 2, respectively. Plant height has shown previous associations with FHB, though the underlying cause of these associations is not well understood. The majority of results have reported increased susceptibility associated with shorter plant types; however, in this study, the haplotype analysis for the Rht-B 1 and Rht-D 1 loci showed an association between the dwarfing alleles and increased resistance to FHB. This suggests either pleiotropic effects of these loci or perhaps linkage with nearby genes for FHB resistance. Markers close to the peaks of the FHB resistance QTL have the potential for Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) marker development and subsequent use in marker assisted selection (MAS) to help improve overall FHB resistance within breeding programs...|$|R
