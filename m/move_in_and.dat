5|$|Regency Square was a prestigious, high-class development, {{attracting}} the social elite. The square gradually lost its prestige status after World War I as hotels started to <b>move</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> by the mid-20th century, {{most of the}} houses had become hotels. During World War II air-raid shelters were built on the square, and an underground car park was built beneath it in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, rather than having the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> {{out of the house}} in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to the high cost of maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the NK 6th Division {{had made}} {{breakthroughs}} in the US 24th Infantry sector to the south, overwhelming the regiment and forcing it back. The 2nd Battalion, 24th Infantry, on the ridges overlooking Haman, was pushed back as its soldiers retreated without orders. Survivors from the 24th Infantry's 1st and 2nd battalions later {{appeared in the}} 35th's lines, and the regimental commanders found that the entire regiment had crumbled under North Korean attack. Kean ordered the 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry to <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> help restore the 24th's position.|$|E

5|$|The Association {{objected to}} the American {{retailer}} Abercrombie & Fitch's plan to open a children's store at 3 Savile Row, concerned that chain stores entering the street would drive up rents, and took part in, what was then, a successful protest in 2012. However, A were allowed to <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> set up a children's store in 2013. A again attracted criticism in January 2015 for its store's colour scheme: brown.|$|E
5|$|Trafford Park {{is almost}} entirely {{surrounded}} by water; the Bridgewater Canal forms its southeastern and southwestern boundaries, and the Manchester Ship Canal, which opened in 1894, its northeastern and northwestern boundaries. Hooley's plan was to develop the Ship Canal frontage, but the canal was slow to generate the predicted volume of traffic, so {{in the early days}} the park was largely used for leisure activities such as golf, polo and boating. British Westinghouse was the first major company to <b>move</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> by 1903 it was employing about half of the 12,000workers then employed in the park, which {{became one of the most}} important engineering facilities in Britain.|$|E

5|$|Nearby {{tracts of}} habitat {{strongly}} affect the wildlife in the Balch Creek watershed. This {{is especially true}} of Forest Park, which extends into other watersheds to the northwest. Birds and animals from these watersheds and from the Tualatin River valley, the Coast Range, the Willamette River, Sauvie Island, the Columbia River, and the Vancouver, Washington, lowlands, <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the park with relative ease. Sixty-two mammal species, including the northern flying squirrel, black-tailed deer, creeping vole, bobcat, coyote, Mazama pocket gopher, little brown bat, Roosevelt elk, and Pacific jumping mouse use Forest Park. blue grouse, great horned owl, hairy woodpecker, Bewick's wren, orange-crowned warbler, osprey, and hermit thrush are among the 112species of birds that frequent the area. Amphibian species seen at the Audubon Society pond include rough-skinned newts, Pacific tree frogs, and salamanders.|$|E
5|$|On 10 January 1913, Asar-i Tevfik {{supported}} another sortie by the fleet, {{this time}} patrolling off the Dardanelles {{while the rest}} of the fleet raided Imbros. While protecting the fleet's flank, she encountered Greek destroyers and forced them to withdraw after firing a few shots. Neither side scored any hits in the engagement. The ship was lost while operating in the Black Sea against Bulgarian forces. On 7 February, the ship was ordered to proceed to Yalıköy to support a raid by the Army. The following day, the raid was launched on the town, but was quickly forced to withdraw from heavy Bulgarian resistance; Asar-i Tevfik was ordered to <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> shell the town, but ran aground on an uncharted sandbank at 12:45. On 10 February, salvage work began, beginning with the removal of equipment. By the 12th, all armament and coal had been removed, but the ship could not be freed. Heavy seas and Bulgarian artillery damaged the wreck, which rendered her a total loss.|$|E
5|$|Randall pursues them to {{the door}} vault, and a wild chase ensues among the {{millions}} of doors as they <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the storage vault on rails to the factory floor. Boo's laughter causes all the doors to activate, allowing the monsters to pass {{in and out of}} the human world. Randall attempts to kill Sulley, but Boo overcomes her fear and attacks him. Sulley and Mike trap Randall in the human world, where two residents at a trailer park mistake him for an alligator and beat him with a shovel. Sulley and Mike then trick Waternoose into revealing his plot with Randall, while Mike secretly records the entire conversation for the CDA to view. The CDA arrests Waternoose and it is revealed that Roz the monster in charge of paperwork is CDA #1 to which she orders Sulley and Mike to return Boo home and has her door shredded to prevent any more contact with her.|$|E

5|$|The main {{shopping}} area was Jackson Square, with about 20 shops. The Army attempted to keep prices down by encouraging competition, but this met with limited success {{due to the}} captive nature of the population, and the requirements of security, which meant that firms and goods could not freely <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out. The Army could give prospective concessionaires only vague information about {{how many people were}} in or would be in the town, and concessions were only {{for the duration of the}} war. Concessions were therefore charged a percentage of their profits in rental rather than a fixed fee. The Army avoided imposing draconian price controls, but limited prices to those of similar goods in Knoxville. By 1945, community amenities included 6 recreation halls, 36 bowling alleys, 23 tennis courts, 18 ball parks, 12 playgrounds, a swimming pool, a 9,400-volume library, and a newspaper.|$|E
