40|$|Carbons {{are being}} widely {{investigated}} as hydrogen storage material owing to their light weight, fast hydrogen adsorption kinetics and cost effectiveness. However, these materials suffer from low hydrogen storage capacity, particularly at room temperature. The {{aim of the}} present study is to develop carbon-based material from natural bio-precursor which shows at least moderate hydrogen storage at room temperature. For this purpose, hydrogenation characteristics of carbon derived from solid endosperm of coconut is studied. Solid endosperm and its carbonized version have a native grown distribution of light elements like K (from KCl), Na, Mg, etc. The hydrogen storage measurements reveal that the as synthesized materials have good hydrogen adsorption and desorption capacity with fast kinetics. The synthesized material adsorbs 2. 30 wt. % at room temperature and 8. 00 wt. % at liquid nitrogen temperature under 70 atm pressure. The present work is likely to initiate research on native light <b>metal</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>carbon</b> derived from natural precursors. Comment: 10 pages 5 Figure...|$|E

40|$|Cane-sugar making {{has been}} a {{principal}} industry in Oinawa for a long time, and recently the equipments and processes of the sugarmaking has been modernized by introducing high pressure boilers and steam turbines. So, the proper operation and maintenance of every mechanical unit in the factory have become important tasks {{from the viewpoint of}} engineers, because a single trouble of the mechanical unit will possibly cause a large damage in the operation of the mill plant. This paper deals with a systematic analysis of a mechanical accident of the mill turbines and reduction gears at one of the cane sugar mill plants in Okinawa. The work includes the investigation of the operative and maintenance conditions at every mechanical unit, visual identification of the damaged parts (mill turbine axis, teeth of the reduction gears, <b>metal</b> <b>bearings</b> and the couplings) and the composition analysis of the turbine axis material. Through a close examination of these minor analyses, the main factors which have caused the accident are pointed out as follows: 1) The fatigue phenomenon {{on the face of the}} damaged turbine axis 2) The eccentric revolution of the turbine axis due to the wear of the <b>metal</b> <b>bearings</b> arings 3) Axial forces between the flanges of the couplings while the eccentric running of the turbine axis 4) Scratched flaws on the thrust faces of the <b>metal</b> <b>bearings</b> 5) The large clearance between the <b>metal</b> <b>bearing</b> and the turbine axis...|$|R
40|$|Microbial strains, {{characterized}} by increased tolerance {{and ability to}} grow in <b>metal</b> <b>bearing</b> wastewaters {{as well as by}} effective metal sequestering capability by both active (bioaccumulative) and passive (biosorptive) processes, were tested as inoculum for metal laden wastewater treatment systems. Their capacity to grow in <b>metal</b> <b>bearing</b> wastewater, using an easily available and inexpensive carbon source such as acetate, was studied in batch experiments. Two principal conclusions were drawn: (1) Growth was observed for all the strains examined suggesting that the strains can be acclimated to <b>metals</b> <b>bearing</b> wastewaters. (2) Solution pH increased from neutral to alkaline values during growth (pH(initial) = 7, pH(final) = 10). The later was observed systematically for all strains. Metal precipitation, due to the metabolically generated alkalinity is expected as a result. Supporting evidence for this hypothesis was provided during the operation of two pilot moving bed sand filters treating two different <b>metal</b> <b>bearing</b> wastewaters. Acetate was used as carbon source to support the growth and maintenance of microbial biomass on the sand grains of the filters. The characteristics of the sludge produced from the operation of the pilot plants were subsequently studied in the laboratory. Both sludges were significantly loaded with large amounts of metals. A mechanism of metal precipitation induced by the metabolically generated alkalinity, when acetate is used as carbon source, could be proposed as the main process responsible for the metals sequestering inside the moving bed sandfilter reactor.

This has mostly been driven by the use of <b>metal</b> <b>bearings</b> in resurfacing, although metal heads have also been used in conjunction with primary total hip arthroplasties.

5000|$|Self-lubricating plain {{bearings}} have a lubricant {{contained within}} the bearing walls. There are many forms of self-lubricating bearings. The first, and most common, are sintered <b>metal</b> <b>bearings,</b> which have porous walls. The porous walls draw oil in via capillary action and release the oil when pressure or heat is applied. An example of a sintered <b>metal</b> <b>bearing</b> in action {{can be seen in}} self-lubricating chains, which require no additional lubrication during operation. Another form is a solid one-piece metal bushing with a [...] groove channel on the inner diameter that is filled with graphite. A similar bearing replaces the figure eight groove with holes plugged with graphite. This lubricates the bearing inside and out. The last form is a plastic bearing, which has the lubricant molded into the bearing. The lubricant is released as the bearing is run in.|$|R

40|$|Creating highly {{articulated}} miniature structures requires {{assembling a}} large number of small parts. This is a very challenging task and increases cost of mechanical assemblies. Insert molding presents the possibility of creating a highly articulated structure in a single molding step. This can be accomplished by placing multiple metallic bearings in the mold and injecting plastic on top of them. In theory, this idea can generate a multi degree of freedom structures in just one processing step without requiring any post molding assembly operations. However, the polymer material has a tendency to shrink on top of the <b>metal</b> <b>bearings</b> and hence jam the joints. Hence, until now insert molding has not been used to create articulated structures.
