40|$|Energy {{security}} {{has become a}} central issue in all developed countries; EU <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> are no exception. Crisis in the energy sector, which {{took place during the}} 20 th and 21 st century, have shown that the formation of a single energy policy at European level will be necessary. Individual <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> have their own national energy policy which is derived from sources at their disposal. The aim of this work is to analyze the energy policy of the European Union and selected <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> and to assess whether it is possible to create a unified energy policy exclusively in the competence of the European Union. At first I will devote the energy policy of the EU and its birth and objectives. In the next section I will focus on the energy policy of individual <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> (France, <b>Great</b> <b>Britain</b> and Italy) and enforcement of this policy at European level. Last part is about to analyze the internal and external aspects of German energy policy...|$|R
40|$|Coalitions will {{probably}} {{become an increasingly}} important theme in European Union (EU) politics. The spread of decision making by majority voting promotes coalition-building behaviour. The impending enlargement is predicted to differentiate and polarize policy standpoints within the EU. Increasing levels of policy conflict imply increased propensities for coalition building. Still, the role and nature of coalitions in EU negotiations are obscure. This article raises important research questions: What characterizes coalition building in the EU? How important are coalitions? What coalition patterns are discernible?Using data from a questionnaire to Swedish participants on EU committees, it is shown that coalitions are more frequent when majority voting occurs than when unanimity rules. Coalition behaviour is, however, important also under unanimity. The existence of consensus norms diminishes the propensity to form coalitions. As regards coalition patterns, there is a prevalence of coalitions based on policy interests and/or on cultural affinity. Contrary to conventional wisdom, consistent and durable coalition patterns seem to exist. The north–south divide is one such persistent pattern. The Swedish respondents thus reveal a close cooperation between the Nordic <b>member</b> <b>states</b> and <b>Great</b> <b>Britain,</b> whereas France and Spain are seldom approached for coalition-building purposes. As to future research, evidence from other <b>member</b> <b>states</b> and from case studies is {{needed in order to}} learn more about the bases for coalition building in EU negotiations...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} is {{a comparative}} analysis focussing {{on the issue}} of deprived urban areas in two EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> - the <b>Great</b> <b>Britain</b> and the Czech Republic. The common link is the mapping of these areas. The dissertation is structured into two main parts - Theoretical and Empirical. The Theoretical part is divided into four main parts, called the thematic blocks. The first block is devoted to the terminology and definitions concerning the deprived areas. The second block focuses on an European-wide project concerning the deprived areas and their mapping, called the European Learning Network (LNet). third block where the mapping of deprived urban areas, the government policy and the examples of good practices are described, is devoted to the <b>Great</b> <b>Britain.</b> The fourth block is aimed on the Czech republic, with the same structure as the chapter before - mapping of deprived urban areas, government policy on this issue, good practice examples and finally the survey carried out among the relevant institutions and its outputs are presented. The Empirical part is the comparison of the <b>Great</b> <b>Britain</b> and the Czech Republic approaches to the issue of deprived urban areas...|$|R
