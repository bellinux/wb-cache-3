30|$|The {{impact of}} {{socioeconomic}} status on {{the prevalence of}} warts is evident in our study as the prevalence was higher in children from rural areas, public schools, and big families. Similar results were also reported in <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>studies</b> [9, 10, 18, 21]. Factors like overcrowding, lower hygiene with sharing of personal fomites, and reluctance to seek medical advice are more common in children from rural areas, public schools, and big families which reflect lower socioeconomic level. Also, the level of paternal and maternal education and work status {{had an impact on}} wart prevalence as high education, skilled father work, and working mothers were associated with a low prevalence of warts. This was concluded in <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>studies</b> [2, 9, 10, 21].|$|R
