Ewing had written about cancer transplantation in 1931, a subject which Rhoads had referred to in his scandalous letter written in November of that year. In 1941 Rhoads was studying the use of radiation to treat leukemia.|$|E

When the institute <b>moved</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> building in 1871, it was renamed as Shaw Collegiate Institute in honor of a major donor.

5|$|Prince Christian {{was given}} the title Prince of Denmark and his family <b>moved</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> {{official}} residence, Bernstorff Palace. Although the family's status had risen, there was little or no increase in their income {{and they did not}} participate in court life at Copenhagen as they refused to meet Frederick's third wife and former mistress, Louise Rasmussen, because she had an illegitimate child by a previous lover. Alexandra shared a draughty attic bedroom with her sister, Dagmar (later Empress of Russia), made her own clothes and waited at table along with her sisters. Alexandra and Dagmar were given swimming lessons by the Swedish pioneer of women's swimming, Nancy Edberg. At Bernstorff, Alexandra grew into a young woman; she was taught English by the English chaplain at Copenhagen and was confirmed in Christiansborg Palace. She was devout throughout her life, and followed High Church practice.|$|E
5|$|Albany's first {{city hall}} was the Stadt Huys, {{built by the}} Dutch at the {{intersection}} of Broadway and Hudson Avenue probably in the 1660s, though possibly earlier. It was probably replaced around 1740 with a larger building, which continued {{to be known as the}} Stadt Huys. In 1754, the Stadt Huys was the location of the Albany Congress, where Benjamin Franklin presented the Albany Plan of Union, the first proposal to unite the British American colonies. In 1797 Albany was declared the state capital of New York and the New York Legislature made its home in Albany's city hall. In 1809 the Legislature opened the first New York State Capitol and Albany's government moved in with the Legislature. After purchasing a plot of land at the eastern terminus of Washington Avenue, across Eagle Street from the capitol, the city government <b>moved</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> city hall designed by Philip Hooker in 1832.|$|E
5|$|Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) notifies Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) that a {{group of}} Trill {{scientists}} will be arriving soon at Deep Space Nine to perform experiments related to wormhole physics. The Trill are a species formed of both a humanoid host and a symbiont, which are implanted into them. The symbionts live far longer than the hosts, and are <b>moved</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> host when the old one dies. Jadzia is the eighth host of the Dax symbiont. Sisko tells Dax that the head scientist is Lenara Kahn (Susanna Thompson), and offers to grant Dax a leave of absence while the Trill scientists are aboard, but she turns it down. Upon Dax and Kahn's first meeting, Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) notices that they are very familiar with each other; Dax tells her that Kahn used to be her wife. Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) later informs Kira about the non-association rules that Trill follow regarding the family and friends of former hosts, and says that hosts of the Dax and Kahn symbionts have previously been married to each other.|$|E

Sylvester was devastated, and although recognizing that he too was probably infected, he refused to have his blood tested, only noticing the virus's first symptoms when he developed a persistent cough. Beginning work on an album that would remain unfinished, he <b>moved</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> apartment on Collingwood Street in the Castro, and tried his best to continue performing in the Bay Area, even though he became too sick to undertake a full tour. Eventually diagnosed with AIDS, he was hospitalized for sinus surgery in late 1987, and upon returning to his apartment he began {{to be cared for}} by his mother and Tracy, before being hospitalized again in May 1988, this time with pneumocystis pneumonia. Returning to his flat, he gave away many of his treasured possessions and wrote his will.|$|E
5|$|Like most stadiums {{demolished}} {{during this}} time whose replacements were located nearby (including the Civic Arena over a decade later), the site of Three Rivers Stadium mostly became a parking lot. Much like the Pittsburgh Penguins would do with the site of Civic Arena, the Steelers retained development rights {{to the site of}} Three Rivers, and would later build Stage AE on portions of the site, as well as an office building that hosts the studios for Root Sports Pittsburgh, the headquarters of StarKist Tuna, and the regional headquarters of Del Monte Foods. On December 23, 2012, on the 40th anniversary of the Immaculate Reception, the Steelers unveiled a monument at the exact spot where Franco Harris made the reception in the parking lot. In 2015, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette <b>moved</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> office building also built on a portion on the site after 53 years in the former Pittsburgh Press building and more than two centuries in Downtown.|$|E

Theatrikos, a local community theater company, was founded in 1972 {{in the basement of the}} Weatherford Hotel, and today puts on six major productions per year. In 2002, the company <b>moved</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> venue now known as the Doris-Harper White Community Playhouse, a downtown building which was built in 1923 as an Elks Lodge and later became the Flagstaff library. Since 1995, the Flagstaff Light Opera Company has performed a variety of musical theatre and light opera productions throughout the year at the Sinagua Middle/School auditorium.
