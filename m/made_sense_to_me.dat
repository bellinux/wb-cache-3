40|$|I’m writing {{these notes}} to clarify {{statistics}} for myself, never {{having had a}} formal class in statistics. It turns {{out that there is}} an interesting reason why I, as a physicist, have never taken a statistics course. This reason is best described in such references as (Loredo, 1990) and (Jaynes, 2003). I have been hearing about “p-values ” and “t-tests ” for many years, and had only a vague understanding of them. I understood probability theory reasonably well, but somehow these terms that I was hearing didn’t quite fit into the way I was thinking. After reading some recent work on Bayesian approaches, I realized that the standard (orthodox) approach <b>to</b> statistics <b>made</b> no <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and the Bayesian way was entirely intuitive. Further, it seemed as if there were serious problems with some of the orthodox approaches, even on some trivial problems (see (Lindley and Phillips, 1976), and Section 4. 1 for an illustrative example). Still, many of the Bayesian articles and books that I read went over examples that were never covered in standard statistics books, and so their similarities and differences were not always clear. So I decided I would pick up a standard statistics book (in this case, (Bowerman and O’Connell, 2003)) and go through the examples and exercises in the book, but from a Bayesian perspective. Along the way, I leaned on such sources as (Jeffreys, 1939; Sivia, 1996; Jaynes, 2003), as well as numerous other articles, <b>to</b> get <b>me</b> through the Bayesian approach. These notes are the (work-inprogress) results. I am also including Python (www. python. org) code for the examples, so I invite any readers to reproduce anything I’ve done.

50|$|It was Cohen's third It's Alive movie.I {{thought if}} I {{was going to}} make a third movie, I had to follow this story through to some kind of new and {{satisfying}} resolution. So, I asked myself some questions: what are these babies like as adults? What is the monster going to look like when it physically develops and ages? I thought those were important questions to answer and deal with. Otherwise, there was no point in making the movie if I was just going to have a load of monster babies running around again, killing people. The second film was, to a degree, different from the first because the protagonists were trying to save the monsters. In the third film, we got all of the monster birth stuff out of the way in the prologue and gave the audience their horror. The rest of the movie was more of an exploration of Jarvis’ character and the progress of the monster children. I thought that differentiation from the events of the previous pictures made Island of the Alive a worthwhile project.Cohen says the theme of the movie were encapsulated in one of the opening scenes, where Michael Moriarty's character argues for his son's existence. Cohen:That scene was really what this film was about: whether or not society was going to permit these creatures to live or if it would destroy them. Such an important question would have to be decided by a jury’s prudence and so the idea of beginning our story with a courtroom trial <b>made</b> perfect <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I liked the idea of commencing the film with a direct moral question. I thought it was a legitimate and challenging opening as the monsters’ very existence was at stake. The monsters are eventually removed from society and quarantined on an island where they will come of age in isolation. In that regard, Island of the Alive is different from It’s Alive and It Lives Again, as I wanted to try something that had a contrasting tone and thrust to the whole story. You’ll no doubt notice that there is much more humour in the third film than in the previous two pictures.The movie was filmed on location in Kaui, Hawaii.|$|R
40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{perspectives}} from which one can parse and analyze laws; formalism, legal realism, law and economics, and feminist legal theory are but four of them. While female legal scholars like myself hold the same diverse range of views as our male counterparts, women {{are far more likely to}} be feminist legal theorists. One feminist method for evaluating a legal regime is to map the ways in which a body of law impacts women differently than men. When it comes to copyright law, a number of astute observations have been made by women legal scholars about the ways in which art forms that are traditionally perceived as falling within the female sphere (e. g., cooking, sewing, hair styling, and make-u p application), or otherwise identified with women, are less likely to be protectable by copyright than creative categories that are gender neutral on the surface, although often dominated by men. This chapter evaluates an unconventional area, namely, the impact of copyright law on a category of works that heavily relies on human bodies engaging in a fairly narrow range of physical interaction s that may result in endangering or damaging the 2 ̆ 2 performers, 2 ̆ 2 who are disproportionately female. Specifically, this chapter explores the relationship between copyright law and pornography. In the late 1980 s and into the early 1990 s, pornography was a hot topic for the legal academy, which gave rise to passionate disagreements. Often these disagreements were characterized by distinguished scholars as a war pitting the supporters of free expression and sexual liberation against the forces of prudery, censorship, and repression. Liberal libertarians and libertarians generally seemed to have a compelling case in favor of pornography: sexual expression is appropriately protected as free speech because people ought to be free to have sex, talk about sex, write about sex, film sex, and view sex any way they like without government interference.

They later took the stage at the Mid-Atlantic Inaugural ball in January 2009.

In September 2013, he was named editor-in-chief at Relix, sharing the role with Mike Greenhaus.|$|R
