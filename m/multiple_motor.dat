5|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} (TS {{or simply}} Tourette's) {{is a common}} neuropsychiatric disorder with onset in childhood, characterized by <b>multiple</b> <b>motor</b> tics {{and at least one}} vocal (phonic) tic. These tics characteristically wax and wane, can be suppressed temporarily, and are typically preceded by an unwanted urge or sensation in the affected muscles. Some common tics are eye blinking, coughing, throat clearing, sniffing, and facial movements. Tourette's does not adversely affect intelligence or life expectancy.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the fifth}} edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), Tourette’s may be {{diagnosed}} when a person exhibits both <b>multiple</b> <b>motor</b> and one or more vocal tics over the period of a year; the motor and vocal tics need not be concurrent. The onset must have occurred {{before the age of}} 18, and cannot be attributed to the effects of another condition or substance (such as cocaine). Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements—such as autism or other causes of tourettism—must be ruled out before conferring a Tourette's diagnosis. Since 2000, the DSM has recognized that clinicians see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E
500|$|Tourette's was {{classified}} {{by the fourth}} version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) as one of several tic disorders [...] "usually first diagnosed in infancy, childhood, or adolescence" [...] according to type (motor or phonic tics) and duration (transient or chronic). Transient tic disorders consisted of <b>multiple</b> <b>motor</b> tics, phonic tics or both, with a duration between four weeks and twelve months. Chronic tic disorder was either single or <b>multiple,</b> <b>motor</b> or phonic tics (but not both), which were present {{for more than a}} year. Tourette's is diagnosed when <b>multiple</b> <b>motor</b> tics, and at least one phonic tic, are present for more than a year. The fifth version of the DSM (DSM-5), published in May 2013, reclassified Tourette's and tic disorders as motor disorders listed in the neurodevelopmental disorder category, and replaced transient tic disorder with provisional tic disorder, but made few other significant changes.|$|E

40|$|The {{co-ordination}} and synchronization {{control of}} motion of <b>multiple</b> <b>motors</b> is a challenging problem, since the synchronization {{of each individual}} motor can be influenced by many factors. This paper presents the concept and implementation of a scheme that uses a real time control approach to realize drive synchronization of the <b>multiple</b> <b>motors.</b> The basic principle of the control is the speed of both master and slave are measured and compared {{in such a way}} to get speed synchronization of both motors regardless of different modes of operation. A new Master-Slave configuration is developed. Imperfect synchronization can be corrected on-line using ARM This paper discusses an implementation where a continuously variable speed operation is provided for the <b>multiple</b> <b>motors</b> by using a single low cost ARM controller. These controllers implement variable speed drives with minimum external hardware thus increasing the reliability. A new master-slave control scheme using ARM is developed. Imprecise synchronization the master-slave technique is designed to reduce the synchronization error under the assumption the slaves can follow the master instantly. More recently there has been a large interest in electronic synchronization, because it offers certain advantages in terms of flexibility and reliability...|$|R
