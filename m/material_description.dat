But any artillery which would have so presented its muzzle must have been very small, and it may be doubted whether even a bowman could have obtained shelter there.|$|E

Note also that the coefficient &sigma;/&omega; depends upon frequency - this is so the attenuation rate is proportional to k/&omega;, which is independent of frequency in a homogeneous material (not including material dispersion, e.g. for vacuum) because of the dispersion relation between &omega; and k. However, this frequency-dependence means that a time domain implementation of PML, e.g. in the FDTD method, {{is more complicated than}} for a frequency-independent absorber, and involves the auxiliary differential equation (ADE) approach (equivalently, i/&omega; appears as an integral or convolution in time domain).|$|E

Models were developed here which can be used to analyze high temperature components manufactured from advanced composite materials. In parallel with these studies, effort was directed at developing multiaxial testing techniques to verify the various theories.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{incorporating}} local mechanical behaviour into a structural {{analysis of a}} cast ductile iron component are investigated. A recently presented simulation strategy, the closed chain of simulations for cast components, is applied to incorporate local behaviour predicted by a casting process simulation into a Finite Element Method (FEM) structural analysis, {{and the effects of}} the strategy on predicted component behaviour and simulation time are evaluated. The results are compared to using a homogeneous <b>material</b> <b>description.</b> A material reduction method is investigated, and the effects of material reduction and number of linearization points are evaluated. The results show that local mechanical behaviour may significantly affect the predicted behaviour of the component, and a homogeneous <b>material</b> <b>description</b> fails to express the stress-strain distribution caused by the local variations in mechanical behaviour in the component. The material reduction method is able to accurately describe this effect while only slightly increasing the simulation time.
