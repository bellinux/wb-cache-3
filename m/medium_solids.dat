40|$|Dense medium cyclone (DMC) {{is widely}} used in mineral {{industry}} to separate solids by density. It is simple in design but the flow pattern within it is complex due to the size and density distributions of the feed and process <b>medium</b> <b>solids,</b> and the turbulent vortex formed. Recently, the so-called combined computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and discrete element method (DEM) (CFD-DEM) was extended from two-phase flow to model the flow in DMCs at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). In the CFD-DEM model, the flow of coal particles is modelled by DEM and that of medium flow by CFD, allowing consideration of medium-coal mutual interaction and particle-particle collisions. In the DEM model, Newton's laws of motion are applied to individual particles, and in the CFD model the local-averaged Navier-Stokes equations combined with the volume of fluid (VOF) and mixture multiphase flow models are solved. The application to the DMC studies requires intensive computational effort. Therefore, various simplified versions have been proposed, corresponding to the approaches such as Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT) method where dilute phase flow is assumed so that the interaction between particles can be ignored, one-way coupling where the effect of particle flow on fluid flow is ignored, {{and the use of}} the concept of parcel particles whose properties are empirically determined.

A series of trials, in both factorial experiments and in single variable experiments, was therefore carried out using a purpose built rig which featured a small industrial scale (700 mm lip length, 900 mm diameter) wet drum magnetic separator. A substantial data set of 191 trials was generated in the work. The results of the factorial experiments were used to identify the variables having a significant effect on magnetics recovery. Observations carried out as an adjunct to this work, as well as magnetic theory, suggests that the capture of magnetic particles in the wet drum magnetic separator is by a flocculation process. Such a process should be defined by a flocculation rate and a flocculation time; the latter being defined by the volumetric flowrate and the volume within the separation zone. A model based on this concept and containing adjustable parameters was developed. This model was then fitted to a randomly chosen 80 % of the data, and validated by application to the remaining 20 %.

There is no model of magnetics recovery in a wet drum magnetic separator, which includes as inputs all significant machine and operating variables. A series of trials, in both factorial experiments and in single variable experiments, was done using a purpose built rig which featured a small industrial scale (700 mm lip length, 900 turn diameter) wet drum magnetic separator. A substantial data set of 191 trials was generated in this work. The results of the factorial experiments were used to identify the variables having a significant effect on magnetics recovery. It is proposed, based both on the experimental observations of the present work and on observations reported in the literature, that the process controlling magnetic separator concentrate density is one of drainage. Such a process should be able to be defined by an initial moisture, a drainage rate and a drainage time, the latter being defined by the volumetric flowrate and the volume within the drainage zone. The magnetics can be characterised by an experimentally derived ultimate drainage moisture. A model based on these concepts and containing adjustable parameters was developed. This model was then fitted to a randomly chosen 80 % of the data, and validated by application to the remaining 20 %.

40|$|Electrochemical {{migration}} (ECM) is {{the growth}} of conductive metal filaments on {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB) through an electrolyte solution under a DC voltage bias. ECM can cause a reduction in surface insulation resistance (SIR) between adjacent conductors and lead to intermittent or catastrophic circuit failures. To evaluate the current leakage and electrochemical migration behavior on printed circuit boards, IPC B- 24 comb structures were exposed to 65 °C and 88 % relative humidity conditions under direct-current (DC) bias for over 1000 hours {{to determine the effects of}} some key factors to ECM. The key factors include: solder alloy (eutectic tin-lead and lead-free), board finish (organic solderability preservative versus lead-free hot air solder leveling), spacing (25 mil versus 12. 5 mil), and voltage (40 V versus 5 V bias), solder mask (using and not using), flux solids content. In-situ measurements of SIR, energy-dispersive spectroscopy after testing and optical inspection before and after test were used. The relationships between the electrical behavior and electrochemical behavior of solder alloys were established. The long term electrochemical behaviors of tin-lead and lead-free solders were obtained. The morphology and distribution of migrated species, including Sn, Pb, Cu and Ag were investigated. Compared with solder alloy, board finishes played a secondary role in affecting SIR due to their complexation with or dissolution into the solder. The competing effect between electric field and spacing was also investigated. Solder mask was found to stabilize SIR and reduce the chances for ECM to occur due to its "walling effect". Compared to low solids flux, <b>medium</b> <b>solids</b> flux increased the characteristic lives of PCBs due to their encapsulation effects.

The combined theoretical and experimental study is designed to contribute fundamental knowledge about reaction pathways, reaction rates, specific intermediates formed, and controls on reaction processes. The specific objectives {{of this study}} are: (1) to describe through batch experiments the kinetics and mechanisms by which potassium permanganate oxidizes dissolved tetrachloroethene (PCE), trichloroethene (TCE), and dichloroethene (DCE), (2) to examine using column studies the nature and kinetics of reactions between potassium permanganate, residual DNAPLs (PCE, TCE, and DCE) and porous <b>medium</b> <b>solids,</b> (3) to represent the process understanding in flow and transport models that demonstrate the potential applicability of the approach, and (4) to apply the resulting computer code in the development of appropriate field tests for assessing the approach. Approaching the end of Year 2 of this 3 -Year project, the authors can report significant progress in meeting the objectives of the study. Through a series of batch experiments, {{it has been shown that}} permanganate oxidation is effective in degrading various chlorinated ethylenes in aqueous solution. The disappearance of chlorinated ethylenes can be simply characterized by a pseudo-first-order model. Degradation half-lives for TCE, cis- 1, 2 -DCE, trans- 1, 2 -DCE and 1, 1 -DCE reacting with 1 mM MnO{sub 4 }{sup -} range from about 24 s to 18 min. Degradation of PCE is much slower with a half-life of about 257 min. Overall, the degradation rate is inversely proportional to the number of chlorines present as substituents on ethylenes. These rates of degradation are impressive given the fact that the experiments were run with MnO{sub 4 }{sup -} concentrations only a factor of 10 or so greater than that of the particular chlorinated ethylene. It would be feasible in practice to increase rates of reaction by increasing MnO{sub 4 }{sup -} concentrations. The experiments also showed how the efficiency of degradation is reduced due to competition from other organic compounds. Contaminated ground water was synthesized as a mixture of ground water and landfill leachate. Three experiments were run with a fixed TCE concentration of 2 mg/L, a concentration of other organic compounds of 101 mg/L (TOC) and concentrations of MnO{sub 4 }{sup -} of 20, 80 and 120 mg/L. As expected, the competition for MnO{sub 4 }{sup -} led to a reduction in the reaction rate, as compared to experiments with TCE in Milli-Q water. However, with the largest MnO{sub 4 }{sup -} concentration, the competition appeared to be offset by other processes that effectively increased the degradation rate of TCE. The preliminary assessment is that colloidal MnO{sub 2 } was catalyzing reactions between MnO{sub 4 }{sup -} and TCE. The authors will explore this aspect of the study in the coming year. Early in the study, the authors confirmed previous work that indicated TCE degraded completely to CO{sub 2 } in a series of three steps. However, little was known about the overall reaction pathways and intermediates that formed. Preliminary indications were that TCE reacted with MnO{sub 4 }{sup -} to produce a cyclic complex, then carboxylic acids, and finally CO{sub 2 }, along with Cl{sup -} and MnO{sub 2 }. Of particular interest in the work were steps two and three. The authors undertook kinetic experiments with radiolabeled TCE (i. e., 1, 2 - 14 C) to understand these reactions. ...|$|E
