5|$|Although Georgia has no {{significant}} oil or gas reserves, its territory hosts {{part of the}} Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline supplying Europe. Russia, Iran and the Persian Gulf countries were against {{the construction of the}} pipeline. The pipeline circumvents both Russia and Iran. Because it has decreased Western dependence on Middle Eastern oil, the pipeline has been a <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States' support for Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Insects are a <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> low {{yields of}} African cowpea crops, and they affect each tissue {{component}} and developmental {{stage of the}} plant. In bad infestations insect pressure is responsible for over 90% loss in yield. The legume pod borer, Maruca vitrata, is the main pre-harvest pest of the cowpea. Other important pests include pod sucking bugs, thrips and the post-harvest cowpea weevil, Callosobruchus maculatus.|$|E
5|$|MU5 was {{designed}} to be about 20 times faster than Atlas, and was optimised for running compiled programs rather than hand-written machine code, something that contemporary computers were unable to do efficiently. A <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MU5's much-improved performance over its predecessors was its incorporation of associative memory, which greatly speeded up access to its main store.|$|E

In contrast, La Niña years are associated with lower precipitation; precipitation is below average during October–December.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 report, {{authored}} by Justice Manmohan Singh Liberhan, found that 68 people {{were responsible for}} the demolition, mostly leaders from the BJP. Among those named were Vajpayee, Advani, and Murli Manohar Joshi. The report also criticised Kalyan Singh, Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh during the demolition. He was accused of posting bureaucrats and police officers who would stay silent during the demolition. Anju Gupta, an Indian Police Service officer in charge of Advani's security, appeared as a prominent witness before the commission. She said that Advani and Joshi made provocative speeches that were a <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mob's behaviour.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the setbacks at the Defile, Marj Ardabil and other similar disasters, the need to reinforce the buckling frontiers stretched the military and financial resources of the Caliphate. This was especially the case with the powerful Syrian army, the main pillar of the Umayyad regime, which was parcelled out to reinforce distant provinces. Eventually, this weakening of the Syrian army would be the <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fall of the Umayyad dynasty during the civil wars of the 740s and the Abbasid Revolution that followed them.|$|E
5|$|Language {{varieties}} of Toraja, including Kalumpang, Mamasa, Tae, Talondo, Toala, and Toraja-Sa'dan, {{belong to the}} Malayo-Polynesian language from the Austronesian family. At the outset, the isolated geographical nature of Tana Toraja formed many dialects between the Toraja languages themselves. After the formal administration of Tana Toraja, some Toraja dialects {{have been influenced by}} other languages through the transmigration program, introduced since the colonialism period, and it has been a <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> linguistic variety of Toraja languages.|$|E
5|$|Malaria is {{not just}} a disease {{commonly}} associated with poverty: some evidence suggests that it is also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to economic development. Although tropical regions are most affected, malaria's furthest influence reaches into some temperate zones that have extreme seasonal changes. The disease has been associated with major negative economic effects on regions where it is widespread. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was a <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> slow economic development of the American southern states.|$|E

5|$|Pritchard {{was also}} music {{director}} of Glyndebourne Festival Opera in Sussex, and it was partly due to his influence that in 1964 the LPO replaced the RPO as Glyndebourne's resident orchestra, providing the players with stable guaranteed work in the slack summer months. The number of LPO concerts in the provinces fell during the 1960s, and {{ceased to be a}} <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> orchestra's finances. During the 1960s the orchestra gave fund-raising concerts in which guests from outside the world of classical music appeared, including Danny Kaye, Duke Ellington and Tony Bennett.

5|$|The {{victims of}} this {{poisoning}} were almost exclusively post-menopausal women with low iron and other mineral body stores. Similar general population cadmium exposures {{in other parts of}} the world have not resulted in the same health problems because the populations maintained sufficient iron and other mineral levels. Thus, although cadmium is a <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> itai-itai disease in Japan, most researchers have concluded that it was one of several factors. Cadmium is one of six substances banned by the European Union's Restriction on Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directive, which regulates hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment but allows for certain exemptions and exclusions from the scope of the law.|$|E
5|$|Although airpower {{was to be}} a <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{defense of}} Lima Site 85, it could not be applied without {{limitations}} and restrictions. The defense of Lima Site 85 was not the sole focus of limited air resources at the time. During this period, the 1968 Tet Offensive was underway in South Vietnam, the Marine outpost at Khe Sanh was under siege, and there existed an unprecedented flow of enemy logistical traffic which had to be interdicted. Lima Site 85 had provided direction to {{about a quarter of the}} USAF missions over North Vietnam and Barrel Roll from November1967 to 11March1968. No other facility existed to provide a similar coverage over these areas. While this loss was a serious blow to the USAF air effort, it was not crippling.|$|E

5|$|By 1922, {{the display}} of unity by white farmers against {{chartered}} rule at the 1920 elections fell apart. The majority of them, mostly ranchers and tobacco planters, who relied on the southern market, voted for Union. On the other hand, Mashonaland maize growers, wanting to retain full share of the local produce markets, wanted responsible government. The 1922 referendum results were 8,774 for responsible government and 5,989 for joining South Africa. The {{role of women in}} the defeat of the Unionists was substantial, with approximately 75% of them voting for responsible government, even when their husbands voted for Union. In a letter to the South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts, the Company Administrator Sir Francis Drummond Chaplin cited anti-Afrikaner sentiments, particularly amongst women, as a <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> result.|$|E
5|$|Common Sense Realism {{not only}} {{dominated}} Scottish thought but {{also had a}} major impact in France, the United States, Germany and other countries. Victor Cousin (1792–1867) {{was the most important}} proponent in France, becoming Minister of Education and incorporating the philosophy into the curriculum. In Germany the emphasis on careful observation influenced Humboldt's ideas about science and was a <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of German Idealism. James McCosh (1811–94) brought Common Sense Realism directly from Scotland to North American in 1868 when he became president of Princeton University, which soon became a stronghold of the movement. Noah Porter (1811–92) taught Common Sense Realism to generations of students at Yale. As a result, it would be a major influence on the development {{of one of the most}} important offshoots of Romanticism in New England, Transcendentalism, particularly in the writing of Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–82).|$|E
5|$|In World War II, {{the bomber}} mafia's {{theory of the}} primacy of unescorted {{daylight}} strategic bombing was proved wrong. Fleets of heavy bombers {{were not able to}} achieve victory without the cooperation of the Army and Navy, and required the protection of long-range fighters for deep penetration missions. Overall casualties in the war were not minimal, and victory did not come significantly quicker. Precision in bombing was not achieved until long-range fighter escorts became available and air superiority was achieved, as opponents had warned. The strategic bombing concept, however, was a <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eventual victory and became the first core doctrine of the independent United States Air Force. Its proponents continued to promote the doctrine into the nuclear age, forming the Strategic Air Command to carry out a vision modified to fit the needs of the Cold War and the threat of nuclear warfare. The bomber mafia was gradually replaced in the 1950s and 1960s by advocates of intercontinental ballistic missile warfare.|$|E

5|$|In retrospect, however, critics often cite Atari's Pac-Man as a <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> drop of {{consumer}} {{confidence in the}} company, which contributed to the North American video game crash of 1983. Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton of Gamasutra stated that the game's poor quality damaged the company's reputation. Buchanan commented that it disappointed millions of fans and diminished confidence in Atari's games. Former Next Generation editor-in-chief Neil West attributes his longtime skepticism of Atari's quality to the disappointment he had from buying the game as a child. Calling the game the top video game disaster, Buchanan credits Pac-Man as a factor to the downfall of Atari and the industry in the 1980s. Author Steven Kent also blames the game, along with Atari's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, for severely damaging the company's reputation and profitability. Montfort and Bogost stated that the game's negative reception seeded mistrust in retailers, which was reinforced by later factors that culminated in the crash.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} {{where the first}} series of Red or Black? aired, ITV gained a much larger {{audience}} share than {{it had in the}} week directly previous, where it had been beaten by BBC One on six out of seven nights. Despite this, reviews of the first series were universally negative, and additional criticism was leveled at the show when it was discovered that Nathan Hageman, the first winner of the £1m prize, had a criminal record. The Sun began a campaign calling for Hageman to return the money, but he was eventually allowed to keep it. It did, however, lead to ITV dropping three other contestants from the show, with at least one withdrawn because of their criminal record. This was also a <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pre-recording of series 2.|$|E
