40|$|Dedicated to Joseph Gallian on his 65 th {{birthday}} and the 30 th {{anniversary of his}} Duluth REU Abstract. Real orthogonal designs were first introduced in the 1970 ’s, followed shortly {{by the introduction of}} complex orthogonal designs. These designs can be described simply as square matrices whose columns are formally orthogonal, and their existence criteria depend on number theoretic results from the turn of the century. In 1999, generalizations of these designs were applied in the development of successful wireless communication systems, renewing interest in the theory of these orthogonal designs. This area of study represents a beautiful marriage of classical mathematics and modern engineering. This paper has two main goals. First, we provide a brief and accessible introduction to orthogonal design theory and related wireless communication systems. We include neither the mathematical proofs of the relevant results nor the technical implementation details, rather hoping that this gentle introduction will whet the reader’s appetite for further study of the relevant mathematics, the relevant engineering implementations, or, in the best case scenario, both. Second, in light of the dedication of this paper to Joe Gallian, who was an extraordinary undergraduate research advisor to so <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> and <b>who</b> inspired so <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> to become undergraduate research advisors ourselves, we describe the involvement of undergraduates in research involving these orthogonal designs and related communications systems. 1...|$|R

There have been massacres of populations like that of the South Americans by the Spaniards or of subject nations by the Turks.

One of the most striking facts is that as of September 2007, there were only five entries by Said in the Czech National Library!. Similarly, only three of his brief essays were translated into Czech? Thus the purpose of this thesis is to grant appropriate attention to Edward W. Said and present an interpretive overview of his work which is necessary before one can begin to place Said in proper perspectives as the individual whom many have claimed as a centrally important twentieth century figure. It will explore Said's contribution to many disciplines ranging from literary theory and criticism to cultural history to postcolonial studies, as well as the literary, cultural, social, and aesthetic roles he has played as an academic intellectual.

Spoofing interferes with GNSS signals and misleads a driver into calculating a different location. Instead of interfering, a meaconing attack intercepts, alters or delays GNSS signals.
