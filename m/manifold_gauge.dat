40|$|The {{fluidization}} {{characteristics of}} a prototype-fluidized bed laboratory reactor were understudied in order to investigate the suitable conditions at which the dehydrogenation reaction of butane could be carried out. To achieve this, a reactor with an effective volume of 1100 ml was fabricated and coupled with temperature and pressure accessories. Zeolites {{were obtained from the}} market and clay obtained from different sources and pre-treated was used as catalyst. Airflow at high velocity between 3000 - 7000 ml/hr was used as the fluidising medium to obtain the bed characteristics while butane gas was used to obtain the dehydrogenation kinetics. The temperature of the reactor system was varied between 353 K and 413 K while maintaining constant pressure of 1. 5 105 N/m 2 through a <b>manifold</b> <b>gauge</b> and a constant catalyst weight. Various methods such as pressure fluctuations, visual observations, and bed expansion were used to determine the transition velocity at which fluidization begins. It was observed that this depends on factors such as mean particle size, particle size distribution, and column diameter. The minimum fluidizing velocity obtained for zeolite was 0. 0133 m/s and 0. 0102 m/s for treated clay materials both for a particle size of 250 µm. The conversion of butane over the catalysts showed an increase in both cases with a maximum at 0. 9813 at 413 K. This decreases as the reaction progresses...|$|E

Since the (anti) selfduality equations are covariant under the quantum group of deformed rotations, translations and scale change, by applying the latter we can generate new solutions from the one centered at the origin and with unit size. We also construct multi-instanton solutions. As they depend on noncommuting parameters playing the roles of `sizes' and `coordinates of the centers' of the instantons, this indicates that the moduli space of a complete theory will be a noncommutative <b>manifold.</b> Similarly, <b>gauge</b> transformations {{should be allowed to}} depend on additional noncommutative parameters...|$|R
