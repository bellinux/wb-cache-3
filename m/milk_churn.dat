25|$|Nelson {{continued}} {{to maintain a}} reputation as a conservative maverick as an independent MP, and in September 1999, called for the introduction of conscription for the long-term unemployed to supplement Australia's then-peacekeeping operation in East Timor. Although he had earlier supported proposals to legalise prostitution in the state, he voted against such moves by the Beattie government in December 1999, arguing that the laws would be impossible to enforce. He caused some controversy in May 2000 when, along with Dorothy Pratt, he was suspended from parliament for 28 days and threatened with expulsion for pouring a <b>milk</b> <b>churn</b> down the stairs of parliament during a protest against the deregulation of the dairy industry. This meant that Nelson had spent more days suspended from the house than any other MP in more than 25 years.|$|E
500|$|Food was eaten from wooden or pewter trenchers with two-tined forks, large spoons, {{and hunting}} knives. Dishware was not popular {{since it was}} easily {{breakable}} and tended to dull knives quickly. Unlike the Quakers and Puritans, feasting {{with an abundance of}} food and drink was never discouraged and practiced as often as was feasible. Generally, backcountry cuisine did not share the religious austerity of the North nor the refinement of the South and was therefore denigrated by outsiders. An apparent lack of fastidiousness in preparing the food provoked further criticism from many sources. The Anglican Woodmason characterized backcountry cooking as [...] "exceedingly filthy and most execrable". Others told of matrons washing their feet in the cook pot, that it was considered unlucky to wash a <b>milk</b> <b>churn</b> and that human hairs in butter were considered a sign of quality. [...] These descriptions seem to be confirmed by an old saying attributed to Appalachian housewives: [...] "The mair [...] dirt the less hurt". Another expression of backcountry hardiness was the lack of appreciation of coffee and tea. Both were described as mere [...] "slops" [...] and were deemed appropriate only for those who were sick or unfit for labor.|$|E

50|$|Nyköping was industrialized {{relatively}} early {{compared to}} the rest of Sweden.

50|$|Many <b>milk</b> <b>churn</b> stands {{would have}} been lost during road {{improvement}} schemes owing to their proximity to the roadside but many were left in situ to slowly decay; thus there are few original wooden examples. However, many made from more durable materials such as concrete or stone have survived and can be seen throughout the country and, indeed, in other countries. Some have been renovated as reminders of the former widespread practice, while some replica stands have been erected {{for the same reason}} in stone (such as the example at Wadenhoe) and the reinstatement or removal of some has even been the subject of planning application. Some <b>milk</b> <b>churn</b> stands have been recorded as historical monuments by regional bodies and the National Archives.|$|E
50|$|The last {{version was}} the Siphon J. By the 1930s, the milk {{companies}} {{wanted to be}} able to assure better quality, and so had requested chilled delivery vehicles. Having experimented with a chilled MICA van using frozen carbon dioxide (dry ice), the 1930s introduced Siphon J was a fully enclosed and chilled by dry ice <b>milk</b> <b>churn</b> transport wagon.|$|E
50|$|Milk stout (also called sweet stout, mellow stout or cream stout) is a stout {{containing}} lactose, a sugar {{derived from}} milk. Lactose cannot be fermented by brewers' yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and the residue adds sweetness, body and calories to the finished beer.

50|$|In Finland, Norway and Sweden, brucks {{were quite}} {{common in the}} rural parts at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century. They were a good option not only where building a railway was not economically feasible, but also where the railwaybuilders had yet to arrive or where the landscape didn't allow for any railway line. For many years the transport of <b>milk</b> <b>churns</b> between farms and dairies was one of the major uses, but as milk tank trucks became common, this was no longer needed. The manual loading and unloading of <b>milk</b> <b>churns</b> was one of the main reasons for an open air compartment, and when this was not a factor anymore, brucks started to become more like the modern versions.|$|R
50|$|The station {{opened on}} 4 April 1898 as Eastbury. The vast {{majority}} of the station's traffic was milk; there was little demand for other goods and so the lack of a yard meant that the <b>milk</b> <b>churns</b> would be left on the platform to be collected.|$|R
