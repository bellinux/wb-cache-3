40|$|WIDESPREAD use of prostigmine {{has shown}} {{it to be}} a useful drug. Like all other {{powerful}} medications, its administration is associated with occasional un-toward side reactions. In the following, we are reporting our observations on two cases of multiple sclerosis in which pulmonary edema occurred in the course of treatment with prostigmine. Careful review of the literature reveals only one case 5 of multiple sclerosis complicated by pulmonary edema and no instances of pulmonary edema attendant upon prostigmine therapy. It is perhaps appro-priate to mention that we have seen several patients in the past with multiple sclerosis who, while under treatment with prostigmine, developed respiratory em-barrassment and <b>moist</b> <b>rales</b> in both lungs. At that time, we were unable to classify the conditions. In the two cases reported below, however, pulmonary edema was manifest...|$|R
40|$|On February 11, 1957, a 14 -year old male terrier was {{admitted}} to Stange Memorial Clinic, {{with a history of}} an enlarged abdomen of 2 months duration. Examination revealed dyspnea, hydroperitoneum, depression, <b>moist</b> <b>rales,</b> and valvular insufficiency. Abdominal paracentesis was performed and 3 liters of fluid were removed. The dog was medioated orally with 1. 5 grains of aminophylline and. 05 mg. of Crystodigin daily. Two days later approximately 2. 5 liters of fluid were again remove. Therapy was continued with steady improvement until the dog was discharged on February 19, 1957, with instructions for the owner to administer orally 1. 5 grains of aminophylline and. 05 mg. of Crystodigin daily for 10 days and then return the patient for a checkup.

On auscultation, <b>moist</b> <b>rales</b> and wheezing sounds were heard in both lung fields, with decreased breath sounds in the right lower lung. A complete blood count showed an elevated white count of 27.7 [*]×[*] 109 /L with a high percentage (94.6 %) of neutrophils. Concentrations of C-reactive protein (patient level 433.1  mg/L v.s. normal range of 0 [*]~[*] 8  mg/L) and serum procalcitonin (patient level 5.44  ng/mL v.s. normal range of 0 [*]~[*] 0.05  ng/mL) were markedly elevated. The patient was supported with mechanical ventilation. Chest tube drainage was performed under ultrasound guidance, and the effusion appeared as a cloudy fluid consistent with pus, with total nucleated cells of 920 [*]×[*] 106 /L. Additionally, the effusion was positive in Rivalta’s test. The results of a Gram stain and acid fast stain for the fluid were negative.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} in 24 gilts to determine the effect of Trypanosoma brucei infection on their reproductive efficiency. The infected gilts developed clinical trypanosomosis following a prepatent period of 2 - 3 days with 1. 8 x 10 ⁶ trypanosomes per gilt. The clinical signs were observed intermittent fever, pale mucus membranes, short <b>moist</b> cough, <b>moist</b> <b>rales,</b> mucopurulent ocular discharges and hyperemia of the skin, reduced feed intake, and loss of body condition, recumbency, uncoordinated movements, posterior paresis and death of gilts. The cause of death in the pigs was pneumonia caused by Escherichia coli. Grossly, the lungs were severely congested and had undergone gray hepatization. Histopathologically, the lungs had thickened and congested alveolar walls, and were infiltrated by mononuclear cells which were noticed more in the lung parenchyma. The role of secondary bacterial infection in the pneumonia observed, orchestrated by immunosuppression, which is a classical attribute of trypanosome infection is discussed. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Although my {{title is}} "Infiltrative Lung Disease, " Dr. Carrington's term, "interstitial disease, " {{would be just}} as appropriate. In {{contrast}} to his subject, I will discuss an interstitial disease which is usually reversible. You have heard that this is not what he wants in his animal models. THE HUMAN CHALLENGE Some persons who are exposed repeatedly to organic dusts eventually develop a diffuse lung disease with characteristic symptoms and signs. Inhalation of such dusts is followed within a few hours by cough, shortness of breath, malaise and fever. Prolonged exposure is associated with progressive dyspnea, weight loss, and, occasionally, permanent disability. The physical findings usually are less impressive than the symptoms. Auscultation of the lungs may reveal only a few localized <b>moist</b> <b>rales,</b> though diffuse coarse rales may appear with acute exacerbations. Pulmonary function tests show a restrictive defect, with a reduction in diffusion capacity. The syndrome is found in farmers exposed to moldy hay (Farmer's Lung) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{total number}} of 400 nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs, {{collected}} with symptom suggestive of respiratory diseases, were examined. Pasteurella multocida were isolated in a percentage 2. 5 from the total samples. Antigenic typing revealed that 50 % of the isolates belong to capsular type A, 25 % to type C and 25 % to type E. Calves experimentally infected with P. multocida type A demonstrated typical clinical signs of haemorrhagic septicaemia, including fever, anorexia, submandebular and brisket oedema, congested mucous membrane, nasal discharge, <b>moist</b> <b>rales</b> in lungs, increase in respiratory rate, increase in pulse rate, tachycardia and recumbency. The severity of infection and mortality rate was more pronounced in calves infected with 10 ml of virulent P. multocida (6 x 10 8 c. f. u. ml - 1) type A. Different organs were demonstrated to be predilection sites for P. multocida; these include lung, heart, trachea, spleen, liver, pharynx and oedematous fluid in the neck and nasal cavity. Infected calves which escaped death and completely recovered showed the presence of P. multocida in the nasal cavity during the whole period of the experimen...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to study the {{characteristics}} of Caprine anaphylaxis with emphasis on clinical features observed during pre and post Sensitization. Six goats of mixed breed were sensitized to the repeated injections of horse serum. During sensitization common clinical signs observed after second and third antigenic injections were frequent urination, defecation, cough, nasal secretion, irregular respiration and heart beat, dullness and depression confirms the success of sensitization. After a latent period of three weeks, all animals were challenged to horse plasma intravenously. Post challenge clinical signs included respiratory distress characterized by a multifold increase in frequency and thoracolumbar irregular and jerky respiration, nasal secretion, severe coughs, shivering, paddling and kicking. Auscultation revealed <b>moist</b> <b>rales</b> over the lung area. Animals were dull, depressed and unwilling to move. The clinical signs observed during anaphylaxis indicate that the lung may be the major shock organ of anaphylaxis in goats.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{identify}} prognostic {{factors in}} middle-aged and elderly patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who underwent integrated interventions involving traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and modern medicine. MethodsPatients aged ≥ 45 years and diagnosed with CAP {{were divided into}} a middle-aged cohort (45 – 59 years) and an elderly cohort (≥ 60 years), and clinical data comprising 75 predictor variables in seven classes were collected. After replacing missing data, calibrating multicenter differences and classifying quantitative data, univariate and multivariate analysis were performed. ResultsOn multivariate analysis, eight independent risk factors – respiration rate, C reactive protein (CRP), cost of hospitalization, anemia, gasping, confusion, <b>moist</b> <b>rales</b> and pneumonia severity index (PSI) – were correlated with the outcome “not cured” in the elderly cohort. Nine factors – neutrophil percentage (Neu%), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), time to clinical stability, appetite, anemia, confusion, being retired or unemployed, Gram-negative bacterial infection and educational level – were correlated with not cured in the middle-aged cohort. ConclusionIndependent predictive risk factors correlated with adverse outcomes in elderly patients were higher respiration rate, CRP≥four times the mean or median for the patient's center, cost of hospitalization> 11, 323 RMB and PSI>II, plus anemia, gasping, confusion and moist rales; those in middle-aged patients were higher Neu%, BUN≥ mean or median, loss of appetite, anemia, confusion, being retired or unemployed and lower educational level.

40|$|According to the World Health Organization, when {{analyzing}} {{the structure of}} the causes of visi­ting to the pediatrician or general practitioner — family doctor, about 70 % of cases occur in acute respiratory infections (ARI). Among the child population, their frequency per a child is on average 6 – 10 cases per year, making ARI {{one of the most common}} infectious disease in the pediatric population of the world. Among the acute respiratory diseases in children acute bronchitis and acute obstructive bronchitis are among the most common diseases. The aim of our work was to study the effectiveness of ivy leaf extract in the treatment of acute obstructive bronchitis in children. Research materials. We observed 33 children aged from 4 to 8 years old who were treated for the diagnosis of acute respiratory viral infection, acute obstructive bronchitis. All patients received Pektolvan Ivy in a complex therapy. Results of the study. Complex treatment of acute obstructive bronchitis in children with the inclusion of the Pektolvan Ivy leads to softening of bronchial secretions and facilitating its discharge of on average already on the 3 rd day of therapy, that manifested with decreased cough intensity, reduced its productivity and the change of dry wheezing <b>rales</b> into <b>moist</b> <b>rales.</b> Pektolvan Ivy has a satisfactory safety profile for the children.

40|$|Pectus Excavatum is a {{congenital}} developmental deformity of {{the anterior}} chest wall, {{characterized by the}} dorsal deviation of the caudal sternum and associated costal cartilages or a ventral to dorsal narrowing of the entire thorax in which several ribs and the sternum grow abnormally. It {{has been reported in}} dogs, kittens, lambs and calves. Burmese kittens and Brachycephalic dogs are more predisposed. Common clinical signs include increased inspiratory effort, inspiratory stridor, <b>moist</b> <b>rales,</b> dyspnea and exercise intolerance. Cardiac murmurs associated with concurrent cardiac defects or compression of the heart and kinking of the great vessels are common. Increased pressure in utero, rickets and increased traction on the sternum due to abnormalities of the diaphragm have been postulated as specific mechanisms. Pectus Excavatum is initially suspected from visual examination of the anterior chest. The radiographic confirmation of Pectus Excavatum is based on the thoracic shape and radiographic changes. Cardiac malposition is usually seen, with the heart shifted to the left of midline and sometimes cranially. More objective parameters have also been suggested including the Fronto-sagittal index (FSI) and vertebral index. More recently the “Haller index ” has been used based on CT scan measurements. An index over 3. 25 is often defined as severe. Patients with mild disease (flat chest) may become normal without surgical intervention. However, animals with moderate or severe disease need surgical intervention. Severity of this condition is repaired in animal by surgical removal of the affected portion of the sternum and replacement with a graft and also by using a cast with sutures around the sternum...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} described pulmonary me-chanics in human pulmonary edema (1). The present report {{deals with the}} effects of morphine, aminophylline and positive pressure breathing on the altered pulmonary mechanics of patients with acute pulmonary edema. METHODS Patients selected for study had acute pulmonary edema as defined by the presence of: 1) moderate to marked dyspnea at rest; 2) <b>moist</b> <b>rales</b> over at least one-half of both lung fields in the absence of fever or other signs of pulmonary infection; 3) evidence of incapacitating heart disease with previous episodes of pulmonary congestion or edema; 4) roentgenographic changes consistent with pulmonary edema. Of the 6 patients studied, 3 had ar-teriosclerotic heart disease, 2 had chronic rheumatic valvular disease, and 1 had hypertensive cardiovascular disease. As soon as possible after the diagnosis of pulmonary edema had been made, pulmonary compliance and re-sistance were measured repeatedly over a 20 to 30 min-ute period prior to the use of therapeutic agents to es-tablish the variability of these measurements over short periods of time. Following the control observations, a single therapeutic agent was given and measurements repeated at intervals varying from 1 to 10 minutes. All observations were made with patients sitting in bed. Morphine and aminophylline were given intravenously in doses of 10 mg and 0. 5 g, respectively. In following the effects of these two agents, observations were made over periods of 25 to 30 minutes following admninistra-tion. Positive pressure breathing was given through a plastic mouthpiece connected in series with a screen pneumotachograph and positive pressure breathing valve.

40|$|Objective: to {{evaluate}} the clinical and hemodynamic effects of CPAP-therapy {{in the treatment of}} alveolar cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE) in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Subjects and methods. The open-labeled prospective study included 22 patients (19 males; mean age, 59. 2 ± 5. 8 years) with CPE that had complicated the course of AMI. Despite the drug and oxygen therapies of CPE for 30 minutes, progressive respiratory and left ventricular failures were an indication for the initiation of CPAP-therapy (7. 3 ± 1. 2 cm H 2 O) that was performed, by employing REM-Star apparatuses (Respironics, USA) and Ultra Mirage facial masks (ResMed, Australia). Oxygen, 2 l/min (FiO 2 = 40 %), was delivered through the mask circuit. Central hemodynamic parameters were measured before and 60 and 180 minutes after the initiation of CPAP-therapy, by using a Swan-Ganz thermodilution cathether (HANDS OFF, model AH- 05000 -H, ARROW, USA). Arterial and mixed venous blood gas composition was rapidly determined on an automatic gas analyzer (Rapidlab 348, Bayer, USA). Results. Cyanosis and acrocyanosis disappeared and the number of congestive <b>moist</b> <b>rales</b> reduced in the lung in 19 (86. 4 %) patients during 30 -min CPAP-therapy. The patients’ oxygen status changed: the value of PaO 2 significantly increased (82. 5 ± 2. 5 versus 57. 4 ± 4. 2 mm Hg at the baseline;p< 0. 05); SaO 2 reached the normal values 60 minutes following CPAP-therapy. There was an increase in the cardiac index (3. 1 ± 0. 2 versus 2. 3 ± 0. 1 l/min/m 2 at the baseline; p< 0. 05), a decrease in pulmonary wedge pressure (14. 4 ± 21 versus 23. 6 ± 2. 1 mm Hg at the baseline; p< 0. 05), and synchronism of right and left cardiac performance. Conclusion. CPAP-therapy optimizes treatment of patients with CPE-complicated AMI, results in the normalization of the arterial blood gas composition, significantly diminishes hydrostatic pulmonary capillary pressure, and promotes the synchronism of the right and left hearts.  </p...|$|R
