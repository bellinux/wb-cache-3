40|$|A {{shared memory}} module {{connecting}} multiple independently clocked processors is presented. The memory module itself is independently clocked, supports hardware address generation, mutual exclusion, and <b>multiple</b> <b>addressing</b> modes. The architecture supports independent address generation and data generation/consumption by different processors which increases efficiency and simplifies programming for many embedded and DSP tasks. Simultaneous access by different processors is arbitrated using a least-recently-serviced priority scheme. Simulations show high throughputs over {{a variety of}} memory loads. A standard cell implementation shares an 8 K-word SRAM among four processors, and can support a 64 K-word SRAM with no additional changes. It cycles at 555 MHz and occupies 1. 2 mm 2 in 0. 18 &# 956; m CMOS. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} uCast, a novel {{multicast}} protocol for energy efficient content distribution in sensor networks. We design uCast {{to support a}} large number of multicast sessions, especially when the number of destinations in a session is small. In uCast, we do not keep any state information relevant to ongoing multicast deliveries at intermediate nodes. Rather, we directly encode the multicast information in the packet headers, and parse these headers at intermediate nodes using a scoreboard algorithm proposed in this paper. We demonstrate that 1) uCast is powerful enough to support <b>multiple</b> <b>addressing</b> and unicast routing schemes and 2) uCast is robust, efficient and scalable in the face of changes in network topology, such as those introduced by energy conservation protocols. We systematically evaluate the performance of uCast through simulations, compare it with other state-of-the-art protocols, and collect preliminary data from a running system based on the Berkeley motes platform.

40|$|The {{design of}} an asynchronously shared memory module for the AsAP {{platform}} is presented. AsAP {{consists of a}} 2 -dimensional array of processing elements with limited memory resources. The memory module expands the storage capacity available to AsAP processors, enabling the mapping of applications with large working sets. The memory module described shares an 8 K-word SRAM among four processors, but can support a 64 K-word SRAM with no additional changes. The memory module is independently clocked, supports hardware address generation, mutual exclusion, and <b>multiple</b> <b>addressing</b> modes. Simultaneous access by different processors is arbitrated using a leastrecently-serviced priority scheme. A standard cell implementation of the memory module cycles at 555 MHz and occupies 1. 2 mm 2 in 0. 18 µm CMOS. – iii – Acknowledgments I {{would like to thank}} all of the individuals who made this work possible.

40|$|BACKGROUND: beta-Thalassemia {{is one of}} {{the most}} common genetic {{diseases}} in humans. We developed an automated electronic microchip for fast and reliable detection of the nine most frequent mutations accounting for > 95 % of the beta-thalassemia alleles in the Mediterranean area. METHODS: We developed a microchip-based assay to identify the nine most frequent mutations (cd 39 C>T, IVS 1 - 110 G>A, IVS 1 - 1 G>A, IVS 1 - 6 T>C, IVS 2 - 745 C>G, cd 6 delA, - 87 C>G, IVS 2 - 1 G>A, and cd 8 delAA) by use of the Nanogen Workstation. The biotinylated amplicon was electronically addressed on the chip to selected pads, where it remained embedded through interaction with streptavidin in the permeation layer. The DNA at each test site was then hybridized to a mixture of fluorescently labeled wild-type or mutant probes. RESULTS: Assays conditions were established based on the analysis of 700 DNA samples from compound heterozygotes or homozygotes for the nine mutations. The assays were blindly validated on 250 DNA samples previously genotyped by other methods, with complete concordance of results. Alternative multiplexed formats were explored: the combination of multiplex PCR with <b>multiple</b> <b>addressing</b> and/or hybridization allowed analysis of all nine mutations in the same sample on one test site of the chip. CONCLUSIONS: The open flexible platform can be designed by the user according to the local prevalence of mutations in each geographic area and can be rapidly extended to include the remaining mutations causing beta-thalassemia in other regions of the world...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{compelling}} long term problems facing the IP and emerging 0 S 1 Internet is growth, At the same time, policy routing-{{the ability of a}} packet source to determine the type of path its packets will take, or the ability of a transit network to restrict usage—is increasingly required. A hierarchical addressing format reflecting the hierarchical backbone structure reduces routing overhead, but restricts paths to the backbones implied by the address, thus limiting policy and reducing robustness. To overcome this restriction, yet keep the efficiency of hierarchical addressing, this paper proposes the use of <b>multiple</b> <b>addresses.</b> In this scheme, directory service would return <b>multiple</b> <b>addresses,</b> and the host would choos...|$|R
