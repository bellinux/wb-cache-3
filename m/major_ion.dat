40|$|Abstract}Aquatic colloids, {{including}} macromolecules and microparticles, with sizes ranging between 1 nm to 1 mm, play {{important roles}} in the mobility and bioavailability of heavy metals and other contaminants in natural waters. Cross-flow ultrafiltration {{has become one of}} the most commonly used techniques for isolating aquatic colloids. However, the ultrafiltration behavior of chemical species remains poorly understood. We report here the permeation behavior of <b>major</b> <b>ions</b> (Na, Ca, Mg, F, Cl, and SO 4) in natural waters during ultrafiltration using an Amicon 1 kDa ultrafiltration membrane (S 10 N 1). Water samples across a salinity gradient of 0 – 20 % were collected from the Trinity River and Galveston Bay. The permeation behavior of <b>major</b> <b>ions</b> was well predicted by a permeation model, resulting in a constant permeation coefficient for each ion. The value of the model-derived permeation coefficient (Pc) was 0. 99 for Na, 0. 97 for Cl, and 0. 95 for F, respectively, in Trinity River waters. Values of Pc close to 1 indicate that retention of Na, Cl, and F by the 1 kDa membrane during ultrafiltration was indeed minimal (51 – 5 %). In contrast, significant (14 – 36 %) retention was observed for SO 4, Ca, and Mg in Trinity River waters, with a Pc value of 0. 64, 0. 82, and 0. 86 for SO 4, Ca and Mg, respectively. However, these retained <b>major</b> <b>ions</b> can further permeate through the 1 kDa membrane during diafiltration with ultrapure water.

The objective {{of this study is}} to assess the groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation activities and to determine the processes that lead to the presence of <b>major</b> <b>ions</b> in groundwater. Twenty groundwater samples were collected from a village on the Plain in December 2014, January 2015, and May 2015, and analysed for <b>major</b> <b>ions</b> and selected suite of minor ions and heavy metals. Groundwater is largely acidic, fresh and soft in nature. Geochemistry showed dominant Ca–Mg–HCO 3 and mixed Ca–Na–HCO 3 groundwater. Sodium impacts the suitability of water for irrigation to some extent. Hydrogeochemical processes identified and verified through factor analysis indicate weathering, carbonate dissolution, ion exchange, and anthropogenic sources including salinisation, due to irrigation and use of fertilizers as sources for the occurrence of <b>major</b> <b>ions</b> at such concentrations in this area. Only concentrations of lead and iron were above the permissible limits with arsenic, copper, zinc, mercury, and uranium found to be within safe limits.

Potential causal mechanisms for decreased macroinvertebrate community scores include (1) lethal or sublethal effects to sensitive taxa, (2) voluntary movement of sensitive taxa out of elevated-TDS stream segments, and/or (3) conditions produced by the elevated <b>major</b> <b>ions</b> that influence sensitive taxa only during certain life stages or seasons.|$|R

This report was prepared {{in accordance with}} Data Qualification Plan TDP-NBS-GS- 00003 1, Revision 2. Additional reports will be prepared to address isotopic and precipitation-related data. Most of the data considered in this report were acquired and developed by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS). The data qualification team considers the sampling and analytical protocols employed by the USGS over the time period of data acquisition to be state-of-the-art. The sample collection methodologies have evolved with no significant change that could {{affect the quality of}} the data considered in this report into the currently used Hydrologic Procedures that support the Yucca Mountain Project-approved USGS Quality Assurance Program Plan. Consequently, for USGS data, the data collection methods, documentation, and results are reasonable and appropriate in view of standard practice at the time the data were collected. A small number of data sets were collected by organizations other than the USGS and were reviewed along with the other <b>major</b> <b>ion</b> and pH data using corroborating data methods. Hydrochemical studies reviewed in this qualification report indicate that the extent and quality of corroborating data are sufficient to support qualification of both USGS and non-USGS <b>major</b> <b>ion</b> and pH data for generalized hydrochemical studies.
