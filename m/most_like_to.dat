Updated monthly, the Nature Index presents research reports of approximately 9,000 parent institutions worldwide presenting a page of output statistics for each institution along with information on institutions collaborating with the institution in the publication of Index articles. Each of the approximately 60,000 articles in the Index has a dedicated article page with social and mainstream media coverage tracked by Altmetric. League tables of output of institutions can be generated on the fly on a global, regional or country basis and by broad subject area {{as well as by}} article count and fractional article count. Compare with other metrics of science (e.g., Impact Factor, h-index), Nature Index is the prominent scientific journal ranking with global reputation on original natural science and life science research. Tracing the flow of scientific knowledge into economic and social benefit is a growing priority for governments and research funding agencies. Nature Index Innovation examines the connection between high-quality research and the commercialization of new products and services. In particular, it highlights the use of references to academic literature in patents to show concrete links between discovery and its economic potential.|$|E

In October 2000, Morton had hinted that he had American recording artist Madonna as his next project, when he responded to an Independent reader in [...] "You Ask the Questions" [...] section. Asked who he would <b>most</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> write a biography of, he said: [...] "I've always admired Madonna as an intriguing and charismatic character who has been able to stay at the top for 20 years."

500|$|Lucy Mangan, {{the culture}} critic from The Guardian newspaper, {{summed up the}} {{character}}: [...] "Pauline Fowler is surely one of the oddest soap creations ever. She is a character without humour, charisma or indeed any redeeming features who became progressively, unrelentingly miserable... She was presumably intended to be the anchoring force for EastEnders, {{but because of the}} writers' unprecedented decision to break with traditional narrative rules and give her not a single redeeming feature, she became more of a sucking chest wound than the heart of the show." [...] This opinion is perhaps shared by a proportion of viewers, as Pauline was voted the 35th most annoying person of 2006 in a BBC Three poll, being the only fictional character to appear on the list. In a Radio Times poll of over 5,000 people in 2004, 13% chose Pauline Fowler as the soap character they would <b>most</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see retired. She came third in the poll, behind EastEnders Den Watts (17%) and Coronation Street's Ken Barlow (15%).|$|E

While {{many of his}} orchestral works are based on movie scores in terms of scope, he does not often listen to movie scores, though he names his favorite composer as John Williams. The influence has been noted by critics, who have termed Soule [...] "the John Williams of video game music". Among video game music influences, he has cited Square for providing him [...] "with the education for what quality means to this business" [...] and Nobuo Uematsu in particular. His favorite style of music to listen to is British pop and rock music, while his favorite video games {{are the ones that}} he has written scores to, especially the ones made by Chris Taylor, though one of his all-time favorites is The Legend of Zelda.

You can accuse me of lots of things – of having a bad day, of missing chances, of many things – but I have always had ambition and always will have.

500|$|Kikuta finds {{composing}} {{music to}} be natural, [...] "like breathing". He considers {{it to be}} his [...] "vocation", and contrasts it with designing and creating video games, which he calls his [...] "wish" [...] and finds {{to be very difficult}} to do in comparison to composition. Kikuta does not worry about the style of music that he composes, considering it to only be a tool or method. As a result, his music is frequently composed of combinations of styles mixed together. He is inspired to create his music by things that he has seen, especially while traveling; he credits much of the musical imagery in Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3 as being inspired by several islands in Fiji he has visited. Rather than trying to be a [...] "pure artist" [...] that creates art for art's sake, Kikuta says that his primary goal in composing is to entertain the listeners. He has not been influenced by other video game composers, though he claims to admire Hitoshi Sakimoto, whom he worked with at Square. He has named Pink Floyd as his single biggest musical influence, and guitarist Allan Holdsworth as the artist he would <b>most</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> collaborate with. Kikuta's favorite song that he has composed is [...] "Overture" [...] from Concerto Gate.|$|E

Dalrymple looks at the downside of an overblown sense of sentiment, which resulted this year with a murderous thug who saw himself as a victim and found 32,000 people agreeing with him, and even opening a tribute Facebook page in his posthumous honor". Spoilt Rotten also made Thomas Sowell's list of Christmas books for 2010. A positive review in The Scotsman stated, [...] "Dalrymple tackles sentimentality on every front. He is frequently witty, always punchy and sometimes rapier-like, as he analyses the 'bunk' of his opponents to within an inch of its cant". In the Daily Express, Neil Hamilton reviewed the book positively, writing, [...] "Theodore Dalrymple's excellent Spoilt Rotten offers some thought-provoking insights and explains how emotional constipation in our national psyche has become emotional diarrhoea".|$|E

At the 2010 Television Critics Association Summer Press Tour, Murphy stated he would be directing the episode, and also revealed that Adam Shankman would guest-direct one of the first ten episodes of the season.

Michael Caine was {{originally}} supposed to be the actor in the episode who takes over Apu's job at the Kwik-E-Mart, but he rejected the role. The story was therefore rewritten so that Woods received Apu's job instead. Woods was one of animation director David Silverman's favorite guest stars. Mirkin said he provided one of the [...] "most fantastic" [...] performances ever on the show, and commented that he [...] "nailed" [...] all of his lines and was [...] "so funny, right {{at the top of his}} head". Mirkin said that when most guest stars come in to record their lines for the show, they are a little nervous because they have never done voice-over before. Mirkin noted, however, that Woods was a [...] "fearless guy" [...] and he was [...] "so excited to do it because he was a huge fan of the show". Silverman noted that in addition to his humorous ad-libbing, Woods's tendency to hesitate while speaking was [...] "great for animation", explaining that it made the character feel more realistic. [...] "Homer and Apu" [...] features the popular Simpsons song [...] "Who Needs The Kwik-E-Mart?", sung by Apu and the Simpson family. The song was written by all of the show's writers in the writer's room, and it was composed by Alf Clausen. The song later appeared on the soundtrack album Songs in the Key of Springfield, which was released on March 18, 1997, and compiled many musical numbers from the show.|$|E

A poll by mobile phone operator NTT DoCoMo of 4,800 users named Yuri on Ice [...] "Most Favourite TV Anime of 2016" [...] and the [...] "Most Moe" [...] series, while another poll by the same company revealed the tenth episode was the eighth most popular [...] "Swimsuit" [...] episode of anime as chosen by women. A poll of 941 voters on the Japanese anime news aggregator AnimeAnime named Yuri on Ice the best anime of the fall 2016 season. Receiving 20 percent of the female vote, it was the eighth-most-popular show among men. An Akiba Souken poll named the series the most satisfactory anime of fall 2016. A poll by Animage magazine of the top 100 anime characters of 2016 ranked Victor first, Yuri K. second and Yuri P. sixth. According to a Charapedia poll, Victor was 2016's fourth-most-attractive anime character; Yuri K. finished 12th and Yuri P. 19th in the poll. In a Anime News Network poll asking people which male anime characters they would <b>most</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> give Valentine's Day chocolates to, Victor came top and Yuri K. came second. Another poll reported that women considered the first and fourth episodes of the series {{to be the best}} anime epsidoes set at hot springs, while a different Anime News Network poll said that the first episode was the best anime episode set in a hot spring. In 2017, there are over 20 dedicated Yuri on Ice dōjinshi events planned in Japan. An all-night screening of the series and a talk show with writer Mitsurou Kubo and voice actors Toshiyuki Toyonaga, Junichi Suwabe, and Kouki Uchiyama (the voices of Yuri K., Victor and Yuri P., respectively) was held on February 11 at the TOHO cinema in Roppongi Hills, and was relayed live to 47 cinemas in Japan.

The change allowed him to compose, in addition to impassioned love music, a number of 18th century pastiches depicting various social milieus. Also, as the supernatural gradually takes possession of the characters, Tchaikovsky matches it with equally ghostly music. He had already experimented in this vein in the transformation scene of The Sleeping Beauty showing an adeptness for orchestrating a strange, even unnerving sound world of dark fantasy.
