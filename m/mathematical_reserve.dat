Insurance is reciprocal {{settlement of}} many subjects endangered {{in the same}} way, whilst the endargement is random by its character and can be evaluated. The very essence of the insurance is to form money fund consisting of payments and premiums of the risk community partners and pay out the insuree the premium or the agreed sum for the damage suffered. Life insurance is {{a special kind of}} insurance with particular characteristics not shared with other insurances. Only life insurance is longterm and economical, whereas the insured sum of money gets always paid out to the insurance holder. Therefore the insurance policy is as valuable as securities, and may also have the guarantee function. Also, the life insurance is an important source for investments with signifi cant profit. The insurance company place out the financial means of the people, which represent the savings premium, and that is <b>mathematical</b> <b>reserve,</b> onto the financial market. <b>Mathematical</b> <b>reserve</b> are temporarily free means of the risk community, insurer means, managed by the insurance company. This obliges insurer to form investment portfolio which will realize added contributions. That is why the strategy for managing <b>mathematical</b> <b>reserve</b> is crucial factor in managing, creating stability and survival of the insurance company. Namely, all insurance companies have the same terms of management and parameter values for net premium calculation and insurance cost price. This means that business results of {{each and every one of}} them derive from the quality of the <b>mathematical</b> <b>reserve</b> investment portfolio. Marketing mix is a modern tool of business policy of an insurance company that functions within market conditions. This strategy is particularly important for the management of the companies that belong to the full competition market activity. All this makes the marketing mix strategy unavoidable in insurance business, especially that of life insurance. It is less essential and needed in compulsory insurance, such as, liability insurance, for instance. In theory and practice the marketing mix strategy includes a product price, promotion and distribution channels. We state and conclude: in life insurance business the added and equally important element of the marketing mix is to invest temporarily free financial means, that is, <b>mathematical</b> <b>reserve</b> of life insurance. Profit, out of these investments, increases the life insurance risk community funds. This provides for the decrease of prices, premiums, insurance, thus increasing competitiveness on the life insurance market. The investment quality, and investment model which is used to optimize the investment portfolio, significantly influence the premium competitiveness and total insurance company business, as well as its survival on the life insurance market. This conclusion is supported by the investigation results of the Croatia osiguranje d. d., Ljubuški business. The data shows a remarkable business competitiveness of this insurer on the life insurance market, secured by its qualitative management of the <b>mathematical</b> <b>reserve...</b>|$|E

40|$|Historically, actuaries {{have been}} calculating {{premiums}} and <b>mathematical</b> <b>reserves</b> using a deterministic approach, by considering a deterministic mortality intensity, {{which is a}} function of the age only, extracted from available (static) life tables and by setting a flat ("best estimate") interest rate to discount cash flows over time. Since neither the mortality intensity nor interest rates are actually deterministic, life insurance companies and pension funds are exposed to both financial and mortality (systematic and unsystematic) risks when pricing and reserving for any kind of long-term living benefits, particularly on annuities and pensions. In this paper, we assume that an appropriate description of the demographic risks requires the use of stochastic models. In particular, we assume that the random evolution of the stochastic force of mortality of an individual can be modelled by using doubly stochastic processes. The model is then embedded into the well know affine-jump framework, widely used in the term structure literature, in order to derive closed-form solutions for the survival probability. We show that stochastic mortality models provide an adequate framework for the development of longevity risk hedging tools, namely mortality-linked contracts such as longevity bonds or mortality derivatives...|$|R
40|$|Discriminant {{analysis}} is a supervised learning technique {{that can be}} used in order to determine which variables are the best predictors of the classification of objects belonging to a population into predetermined classes.

The main goal of discriminant {{analysis is}} to determine which of the N descriptive variables have the most discriminatory power, that is, which of them are the most relevant for the classification of objects into classes. In order to classify objects, we need a mathematical model that provides the rules for optimal allocation. This is the classifier.

The affiliate’s mortality is modelled by a jump process and the benefits paid at retirement are function of the evolution of stochastic salaries.

The objective is to minimize both the quadratic spread between the contribution rate and the normal cost, and the quadratic spread between the terminal wealth and the <b>mathematical</b> <b>reserve</b> required to cover benefits.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse, in a contingent-claims framework, {{one of the}} most common life {{insurance}} policies sold in Italy during the last two decades. The policy, of the endowment type, is initially priced as a standard one, given a mortality table and a technical interest rate. Subsequently, at the end of each policy year, the insurance company grants a bonus, which is credited to the <b>mathematical</b> <b>reserve</b> and depends on the performance of a special investment portfolio. More precisely, this bonus is determined in such a way that the total interest rate credited to the insured equals a given percen-tage (participation level) of the annual return on the reference portfolio and anyway does not fall below the technical rate (minimum interest rate guaran-teed, henceforth). Moreover, if the contract is paid by periodical premiums, it is usually stated that the annual premium is adjusted at the same rate of the bonus, and thus the benefit is also adjusted in the same measure. In such policy the variables controlled by the insurance company (control-variables, henceforth) are the technical rate, the participation level and, in some sense, the riskiness of the reference portfolio measured by its volatility. However, as it is intuitive, not all sets of values for these variables give rise to a fair contract, i. e. to a contract priced consistently with the usual assump-tions on financial markets and, in particular, with no-arbitrage. We derive then necessary and sufficient conditions under which each control-variable is determined by a fair pricing of the contract, given the remaining two ones...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this chapter is to introduce flexible reverse mortgage contracts and to consider them in a multiple decrement model. Here, the multiple decrement approach is applied {{for the first time}} in housing and urban planning as a new tool for better forecasting of the housing market and housing needs of senior citizens with decreasing functional capacities and therefore changing housing needs on their lifetime horizon. The presented approach enables development of appropriate, more flexible equity release schemes (ERS) than the products known up to now. In the flexible reverse mortgage model developed here we assume that the homeowner can always sell her/his residential property and buy the new residential property for the amount which is of the same value as that of the first house, or lower. It enables better management of cash flows related to the portfolio of residential properties in the context of ERS-the reverse mortgage approach. The schemes are designed to allow elderly homeowners to convert the equity in their homes to income and to keep the possibility to sell their property and move to a more appropriate dwelling under the same contract, which was not the case up to now. Namely, in these newly presented ERS products, homeowners can also keep the <b>mathematical</b> <b>reserves</b> for longevity insurance, based on the initial contract, when they move and sell the initial residential property and buy a new one. They also keep their deferred lifetime annuities if they finally sell the residential property and move to long-term care in a retirement home. In this new approach, the reverse mortgage schemes/longevity insurance are not tied to the single property as it is the case in the existing reverse mortgage products, but rather to the life of the senior homeowner. In the numerical examples, different cash flows associated with different paths of a graph are presented demonstrating the advantages of the flexible reverse mortgage. We show that not only the transaction costs are lower but also that the set of possible choices is larger. According to population aging in Europe, where in 2060 one-third of the population will be more than 64 years old, it is important also for the local authorities and spatial planners to study elderly people's housing needs in order to design a housing system suitable also for them, and therefore to adopt the housing stock to the desired housing consumption. The housing needs of senior citizens may be satisfied if the housing stock is specifically designed to meet their physical, emotional, recreational, medical, and social needs. Recognizing that urban space must be adapted to meet these objectives, the paper will examine the issues regarding the sustainable financing of senior citizens and their changing housing needs in particular...|$|R

These services include the long-term care. The key issue which until now has not been answered is how to develop a quantitative model for measuring the quality of social care services for the elderly, and how to plan the facilities for needs of seniors which will be available in {{accordance with}} the demand. As stated in the Operational Programme, Slovenia does not have a compact system for regulation of long-term care. Services and rights are arising from the different existing systems - health, pension and disability insurance {{as well as from the}} social welfare system. Given the demographic structure and projections developed by European Commission and presented in The Ageing Report 2015, there is a need for reform that will enable the establishment of a uniform system of high-quality community-based services for ageing in place and for those that will need institution forms of care. Slovenia is preparing new legislation in the field of long-term care (LTC), which will have to take into consideration also a different type of facilities where LTC services will be provided. This will require the development of model for projections of needs and eligibility for integrated health and social services, LTC, monitoring of recipients of services and funds for LTC, and coordinating the development of integrated community-based services, as required in Operational Programme for the implementation of the European cohesion policy for the period 2014 – 2020 (European Commission, 2014). In the book, we shall develop a model for measuring the quality of the system of LTC, for which even the OECD documents state that has not yet been developed and show how the optimal policy requires higher dynamics of providing facilities for seniors. A more objective measuring instrument, based on an actuarial - mathematical methods will be presented. Thus, the objective of the boook is to present how to develop an actuarial model for determining the quality of care in different types of facilities in the system of LTC. The book will also present the proposal for model of collecting and processing data in the system of statistical reports relevant for the whole country, to better forecast the long-term needs of facilities for seniors with declining functional capacities. The core of the book describes a multiple decrement model embeded in housing and urban planning as a tool for better forecasting a housing market and housing needs of senior citizens with decreasing functional capacities and therefore changing housing needs on their lifetime horizon. The presented approach enables development of appropriate, flexible equity release schemes (ERS) and better management of cash flows related to the portfolio of residential properties in the context of ERS.

40|$|Introduction: Groundwater is {{the most}} {{important}} resource of providing sanitary water for potable and household consumption. So continuous monitoring of groundwater level will {{play an important role in}} water resource management. But because of the large amount of information, evaluation of water table is a costly and time consuming process. Therefore, in many studies, the data and information aren’t suitable and useful and so, must be neglected. The PCA technique is an optimized <b>mathematical</b> method that <b>reserve</b> data with the highest share in affirming variance with recognizing less important data and limits the original variables into to a few components. In this technique, variation factors called principle components are identified with considering data structures. Thus, variables those have the highest correlation coefficient with principal components are extracted as a result of identifying the components that create the greatest variance. Materials and Methods: The study region has an area of approximately 962 Km 2 and area located between 37 º 21 ´ N to 37 º 49 ´ N and 44 º 57 ´ E to 45 º 16 ´ E in West Azerbaijan province of Iran. This area placed along the mountainous north-west of the country, which ends with the plane Urmia Lake and has vast groundwater resources. However, recently the water table has been reduced considerably because of the exceeded exploitation as a result of urbanization and increased agricultural and horticultural land uses. In the present study, the annual water table datasets in 51 wells monitored by Ministry of Energy during statistical periods of 2002 - 2011 were used to data analysis. In order to identify the effective wells in determination of groundwater level, the PCA technique was used. In this research to compute the relative importance of each well, 10 wells were identified with the nearest neighbor for each one. The number of wells (p) as a general rule must be less or equal to the maximum number of observations (n), here it is the number of years. So, for each well there are a 10 * 10 matrix. It should be noted in monitoring adjacent wells to a specific well, its dataset is not used. To quantify the effect of each well according to the number of its participation in the analysis and frequency of its effectiveness, each well is ranked. In the next step, the ineffective wells were recognized and eliminated using both the variation coefficient and Error criteria. Following, the procedure will be discussed. Results Discussion: In this study, at first step using PCA technique wells were identified with a more than 0. 9 correlation coefficient. Then each well ranked based on the relative importance and according to the specified thresholds, the variation coefficient and error of monitoring was estimated. The wells remain in threshold 1 led to the lowest variation coefficient, considered as effective wells in the evaluation of aquifer parameters. By eliminating ineffective wells at each threshold, the variation coefficient is reduced because of the elimination of wells with a greater difference in water depth compared to the average of whole wells. To check the certainty of obtained results, the error criteria were calculated for each threshold. According to the results, both variation coefficient and standard error of monitoring in threshold 1 come to be at least. Thus, 12 wells remain in the threshold 1 are considered as the important wells in monitoring the water table of plain Urmia. Monitoring error for these 12 wells is equal to 5. 1...|$|R
