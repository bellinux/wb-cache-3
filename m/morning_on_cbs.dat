50|$|Local telethons, once {{a common}} fixture {{in nearly every}} major city in the United States, are now rare but still found {{in a handful of}} cities, {{including}} Louisville, Kentucky (WHAS Crusade for Children), Buffalo, New York (Kids Escaping Drugs telethon for youth drug rehabilitation, broadcast annually by WGRZ; and the Variety Club Telethon, held each winter on WKBW-TV for Variety, the Children's Charity); Green Bay, Wisconsin (the Cerebral palsy telethon on WBAY-TV) and Erie, Pennsylvania (the Community for Kanzius Telethon on WICU and WSEE for the Kanzius Cancer Research Foundation). New York City also features a telethon of sorts; the WFAN Radiothon, by virtue of its two drive time shows being simulcast on cable television, has portions covered on television. Since 2010, this has included the portion covering Boomer and Carton in the <b>Morning</b> <b>on</b> <b>CBS</b> Sports Network and Mike's On on Fox Sports 1/2. From 2002 to 2007, the shows in question were Imus in the Morning on MSNBC and Mike and the Mad Dog on YES; Imus has since revived radiothons on his current homes, WABC and Fox Business Network.|$|E
5000|$|The morning {{shows of}} the three major American {{broadcast}} networks - Today on NBC, Good Morning America on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) (whose ticker is also used on the early morning newscast America This Morning, and occasionally during breaking news events covered on the overnight newscast World News Now), and CBS This <b>Morning</b> <b>on</b> <b>CBS</b> - display their own tickers throughout much of the broadcasts, except during commercial breaks and weather segments. However, in some markets, local network affiliates display their own tickers in place of those used by the network. In the case of Today, NBC designed the ticker used on that program for the purpose of allowing affiliates to display local news headlines over the space and does not provide a fallback headline scroll featuring national and international news stories, resulting in the ticker appearing merely blank on NBC stations that do not provide a headline overlay in the space; CBS This Morning similarly does not provide a universal news ticker and individual CBS stations may instead use a ticker designed to match the program's graphical scheme. By comparison, Good Morning America features a fallback national ticker, with some ABC affiliates using it in lieu of overlaying a locally programmed headline ticker. At minimum, the continuous on-screen displays used by all three programs incorporate a bug displaying the current local time and temperature.|$|E

40|$|The {{correlations}} of {{primary and secondary}} structures were analyzed using proteins with known structure from Protein Data Bank. The correlation values of amino acid type and the eight secondary structure types at distant position were calculated for distances between - 25 and 25. Shapes of the diagrams indicate that amino acids polarity and capability for hydrogen bonding have influence on the secondary structure at some distances. Clear preference {{of most of the}} amino acids towards certain secondary structure type classifies amino acids into four groups: alpha-helix admirers, strand admirers, turn and bend admirers and the others. Group four consists of His and Cis, the amino acids that do not show clear preference for any secondary structure. Amino acids from a group have similar physicochemical properties, and the same structural characteristics. The results suggest that amino acid preference for secondary structure type is based on the structural characteristics at Cb and Cg atoms of amino acid. alpha-helix admirers do not have polar heteroatoms <b>on</b> <b>Cb</b> and Cg atoms, nor branching or aromatic group <b>on</b> <b>Cb</b> atom. Amino acids that have aromatic groups or branching <b>on</b> <b>Cb</b> atom are strand admirers. Turn and bend admirers have polar heteroatom <b>on</b> <b>Cb</b> or Cg atoms or do not have Cb atom at all. Our results indicate that polarity and capability for hydrogen bonding have influence on the secondary structure at some distance, and that amino acid preference for secondary structure is caused by structural properties at Cb or Cg atoms.
