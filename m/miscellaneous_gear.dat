40|$|The {{following}} report {{documents the}} attempt to design a safe and reliable process for transporting Louder Spaceâ€™s musical gear that requires minimal physical demand. Design specifications were derived from customer requirements as well as human factors principles. The transportation process was broken down into systematic process steps and standardized, making use of lean methodologies {{in order to reduce}} the number of non-value steps involved. Furthermore, a model portable storage unit for <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>gear</b> was developed to the specifications determined by the band using 3 D modeling, as well as certain limiting constraints. Once the customer approved the prototype, the product was broken down into a bill of materials and manufactured. Once the product and improved process were implemented, extensive analysis revealed a profit of about $ 2, 485 each year...|$|E

Documents provided by DOD show that in fiscal year 1990, DOD provided training and equipment with a value of at least $17 million to Mexico, $1.3 million to Bolivia, $10 million to Colombia, $1 million to Ecuador, and $1 million to Peru. DOD officials informed us that training and equipment valued at more than these amounts {{may also have been}} provided. However, documentation was not available at the Washington, D.C., agency headquarters level that specified the amounts for law enforcement activities.

40|$|Photograph of Professor William Lees Judson {{painting}} {{a picture on}} the bank of the Colorado River during a trip with George Wharton James, ca. 1910. He sits on a small stool at right with his brush poised over his palette. His canvas can be seen mounted on a tripod in front of him. <b>Miscellaneous</b> camp <b>gear</b> litters the ground around and behind him. Another man stands in one of two small boats moored just off-shore at left. He is leaning over the water as though having just washed his hands. Trees grow thickly on the far bank.; William Lees Judson was a prominent painter who came to the Los Angeles area in 1893, and founded the first school of fine art in Southern California, the Los Angeles College of Fine Arts. The college became part of the University of Southern California in 1897. The original building erected on the site in the Arroyo Seco in Garvanza in 1901 was designed by Judson. He retired in 1920...|$|R
40|$|Research PaperThe {{government}} in Taiwan has recently instituted {{a comprehensive program}} to give fishermen the incentive to reduce fishing effort voluntarily. In this study, we conducted a survey to investigate fishermen's behavior and used the ANOVA analysis and the Probit model to identify factors that affect fishermen's willingness to accept the reward for reducing fishing activities. out of the 279 valid samples, only 161 (57. 71 %) respondents {{are willing to accept}} the offer, which is much lower than the more than 80 % that government expected. However, 98. 57 % of the respondents realized the deterioration of the coastal and offshore fishery resources and 78 % supported restrictions on fishing activities during the spawning and juvenile seasons, and indication that a need for a mandatory season closure policy in the future. This study finds that the accuracy of prediction of the Probit model is 87. 81 %, indicating that the model predicts fisherman's choice reasonably well. The primary variables that affect fishermen's willingness to accept the Reward of Reducing Fishing Activities Program are the average number of fishing days per trips, they type of policy in the coastal and offshores fishery deemed most urgent, whether the rewarding schedule being reasonable or not, the willingness to support rewarding schedule, and the willingness to support the {{government in}} implementing a restriction on fishing activities during the spawning and juvenile seasons. The Probit regression results show that fishermen with fishing vessels that re between 50 and 100 tons are more likely to accept the offer than other fishermen. This may be attributed to the reduction of support on fuel, since larger size fishing vessels have higher fuel costs. Fishing vessel operators whose major fishing gears are torch light or others <b>miscellaneous</b> fishery <b>gears</b> and operate on a seasonal basis are more likely to accept the offer than fishing vessels in trawl and angling fisheries. Fishing vessels fishing within 12 nautical miles from the shore and whose owners are older than sixty-one years old are more likely to accept the offer. On the other hand, fishermen who disagree or very much disagree with the rewarding scheme and the view that fishing effort should be reduced when the support of fuel decreases, and who are unwilling to accept the offer under the reward level set for 2004, showed a lower percentage to accept the offer...|$|R
