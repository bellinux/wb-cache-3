5|$|Jerusalem is {{recognized}} as a sacred site in Islam. Though the Quran does not mention Jerusalem by name, it has been understood by Islamic scholars since the earliest times that many passages in the Quran refer to Jerusalem. Jerusalem is also mentioned <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hadith. Some academics attribute the holiness of Jerusalem to the rise and expansion of {{a certain type of}} literary genre, known as al-Fadhail or history of cities. The Fadhail of Jerusalem inspired Muslims, especially during the Umayyad period, to embellish the sanctity of the city beyond its status in the holy texts. Others point to the political motives of the Umayyad dynasty which led to the sanctification of Jerusalem in Islam.|$|E

5|$|Charles Y. Harvey {{began work}} on Boy with Turtle at his studio in New York City, believing that this work {{was going to be}} his masterpiece. Almost {{immediately}} he began second guessing his design and feeling that it was inadequate. This negativity was a trait that he had shown <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past. Roughly a week after beginning the sculpture, Harvey began hearing voices commanding him to kill himself. A paper about restoring the sculpture written at Worcester Polytechnic Institute claims the voices he was hearing were coming from the partially carved sculpture itself. These voices set the date of Saturday January 27, 1912 for Harvey to kill himself. On that date he laid down his tools, headed to Bronx Park with two razors, and slit his own throat along {{the west bank of the}} Bronx River.|$|E
