Saran has said [...] "When I studied in DPS Mathura Road in Delhi, there was a school for blind exactly opposite to our school. I used to go there every week and spend time seeing how these students played cricket and did other things normally. That is what inspired <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> for these people". In an interview to TOI, the actress said: [...] "We feel sympathetic towards them, but we never employ them. We are scared because we have not grown up with them. While these people might be visually impaired, their other senses are very strong. So they can effectively give foot and back massages and treatments like reflexology. It's {{important to understand that}} you are not doing a favour on them but they are doing a favour on you".|$|E

The original intention was to release the game in 1998, even synchronizing with the supposed end of the anime's [...] Development issues, worsened by Game Freak being sidetracked with Pokémon Stadium and the localization of the first generation, led the game to be postponed, and the original release slate {{was taken over by}} Pokémon Yellow. Programmer Shigeki Morimoto stated that part of why development took {{three and a half years}} was due to being a small team of only four programmers, [...] "We were very greedy in terms of all the features we wanted to include in the games". Ishihara declared that Gold and Silver were supposed to be the last in the series – [...] "I didn’t intend to make any more Pokémon titles. I even thought that once we entered the twenty-first century, it would be time for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> else entirely" [...] – and most of the licensed merchandising, including the Pokémon Trading Card Game, were to [...] "ensure Gold and Silver were successful".|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't!" [...] Elizabeth pleaded. [...] "The city night always affects me. It makes <b>me</b> want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> adventurous, and on Christmas Eve {{it is even}} worse. If {{you keep}} on like that I shall soon be telling David to drive us up and down State Street all night." ...|$|R

It makes <b>me</b> want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>{{something}}</b> good, something grand. It makes me so sorry for everybody. It makes me like Schiller--I {{want to take the}} world in my arms and kiss it. I must kiss you instead, little mother?" [...] She threw her arms round her mother's neck.|$|R
2500|$|From a New York Times {{interview}} in 1942: [...] "When the war started... {{felt that it}} was up to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something,</b> and the only thing I know is show business. I went around during the last war and I saw that the boys needed something besides chow and drills. I knew the same was true today, so I told the people in Washington that I would go anywhere and do an act for the Army." [...] Shortly after the war began, he wrote a letter to Steven Early, press secretary to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, volunteering [...] "to head a committee for the entertainment of soldiers and said that he [...] "would work without pay... would gladly assist in the organization to be set up for this purpose".

2500|$|Kournikova {{received}} her first tennis racquet as a New Year gift in 1986 at age 5. Describing her early regimen, she said, [...] "I played two {{times a week}} from age six. It was a children's program. And it was just for fun; my parents didn't know I {{was going to play}} professionally, they just wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> because I had lots of energy. It was only when I started playing well at seven that I went to a professional academy. I would go to school, and then my parents would take me to the club, and I'd {{spend the rest of the}} day there just having fun with the kids." [...] In 1986, Kournikova became a member of the Spartak Tennis Club, coached by Larissa Preobrazhenskaya. In 1989, at the age of eight, Kournikova began appearing in junior tournaments, and by the following year, was attracting attention from tennis scouts across the world.

2500|$|On February 16, 2009, Travis {{attacked}} Sandra Herold's 55-year-old friend Charla Nash, inflicting devastating {{injuries to}} her face and limbs. Travis had left the house with Sandra Herold's car keys, and Nash came to help get the chimp back in the house; upon seeing Nash holding {{one of his favorite}} toys, Travis immediately attacked her. [...] Travis was familiar with Nash, who had also worked at the Herolds' towing company, although Nash had a different hair style {{at the time of the}} attack. [...] The chimp had been taking medication for Lyme disease. Herold, then 70 years old, attempted to stop Travis by hitting him with a shovel and stabbing him with a butcher knife. [...] "For <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> like that – put a knife in him – was like putting one in myself," [...] Herold later said. The chimp turned around, she said, as if to say, [...] "'Mom, what did you do?'" [...] The ape was angered more. Herold then called 9-1-1 and pleaded for help. Travis' screams can be heard in the background of the tape as Sandra pleads for police, who initially believed the call to be a hoax, until she started screaming, [...] "He's eating her!" [...] Emergency medical services waited for police before approaching the house. Travis walked up to the police car when it arrived, tried to open a locked passenger door, and smashed a side-view mirror. Then he went calmly around to the driver's-side door and opened it, at which point Officer Frank Chiafari shot him several times. Travis retreated to the house, where he was found dead next to his cage.|$|E
60|$|In the {{irritable}} {{condition of}} my mind, {{at the time}} of which I am now writing, the abortive result of my journey to the Sergeant's cottage simply aggravated the restless impulse in <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be <b>doing</b> <b>something.</b> On the day of my return from Dorking, I determined that the next morning should find me bent on a new effort at forcing my way, through all obstacles, from the darkness to the light.|$|R
60|$|Well, {{something}} went wrong with the aeroplane the second day, and it wouldn't fly, and then I was in solid again; but I had done some hard thinking and I knew just where I stood. I was the newest toy, that's what I was, and something newer might come along at any moment, {{and then it would}} be the finish for me. The only thing for <b>me</b> was <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> impress the adults, just as Jack had said.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{understand}} all this," [...] replied Colville. [...] "Who has proposed to exclude you?

5000|$|Lin went to {{high school}} in Vancouver before moving to Toronto. After {{learning}} about the Tiananmen Massacre, and the persecution of Falun Gong, she began talking to dissidents herself. “It really shocked <b>me.</b> I wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> for them.

6000|$|... "Now, {{what can}} I do?" [...] she asked, {{with a little}} laugh. [...] "Please order <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something.</b> I am your slave, you know, and I want to be helping you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I guess not. Of course I can't tell. Doc Linyard {{may want}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> for him--write a letter or so, {{and that all}} takes time. I'll be back by nine, I guess." ...|$|E
5000|$|Müller decided {{early on}} that he would play the guitar and become a guitarist. From {{the time he was}} six he heard loads of records with The Beatles {{together}} with his big brother. At nine something happened when he was on vacation at Sjusjøen by Lillehammer with his family. The tune [...] "The Wind Cries Mary" [...] by Jimi Hendrix was played on the jukebox at the hotel, {{and it was as if}} he were sighed.

5000|$|... "Let's be honest," [...] said Fox at the time. [...] "If {{this movie}} makes a buck {{and a half}} it's going to be things like Bikini's Away for <b>me.</b> But <b>to</b> fail <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> {{unexpected}} is no disgrace. <b>To</b> fail <b>doing</b> the ordinary is a disaster.

60|$|I {{decided to}} kill Cecil Winwood. You see, Morrell was gone, and Oppenheimer, until the {{outbreak}} that finished him, had {{remained in the}} silence. Solitary had grown monotonous for <b>me.</b> I had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something.</b> So I remembered {{back to the time}} when I was Adam Strang and patiently nursed revenge for forty years. What he had done I could do if once I locked my hands on Cecil Winwood's throat.|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with [...] " [...] Sikh Chic" [...] Daljit has stated his reason for translating the novel Roll Of Honour : [...] "Punjabi has its own texture and diversity of dialects.

I thought {{that it would be a}} liberating experience, which it turned out to be." ...|$|R
2500|$|Desert Hearts was Patricia Charbonneau's film debut. In a {{separate}} interview, Charbonneau said, [...] "When I first read it, I thought, 'Well, everything that I've {{done so far}} people have taken a risk with <b>me.</b> I wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> that at least people would talk about.

The hard part was just walking out on the set naked and just standing there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had one, but Nevis wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> that didn't {{seem quite}} {{what we had}} agreed on, and I went over with the deed to show him he was wrong.

6000|$|It was plainly {{time for}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something,</b> {{and she decided}} the point for me by {{slightly}} {{moving away from the}} wall.

6000|$|Olive {{leaned back}} on the bench, and laughed heartily. [...] "There is so much {{excellent}} advice in this world," [...] she said, [...] "which {{is not intended to}} be used.

And, if I were not ashamed, I cannot say that I think that society would be dealing unjustly with me in converting the moral obligation into a legal one. There is a manifest unfairness in letting all the burden be borne by the willing horse.|$|R
