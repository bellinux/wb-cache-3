5|$|DAB {{has also}} been marketed as having two major {{advantages}} over analogue radio broadcasting in that using MPEG-1 Audio Layer II lossy audio compression technology and more recently DAB+ using High-Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding, parts of the audio spectrum that cannot be heard by humans are discarded, meaning less data needs to be sent over the air. This, as well as <b>multiplexing</b> <b>technology,</b> allows a number of channels to be broadcast together on one frequency as opposed to one channel for analogue radio broadcasts.|$|E
5|$|The BBC {{and other}} DAB {{broadcasters}} have been encouraging DAB take up by promoting {{a number of}} features which are either new or improve upon former technology in their sales literature. The benefit of DAB is that due {{to the use of}} <b>multiplexing</b> <b>technology</b> and encoding technology, broadcasters including the BBC and EMAP have been able to launch exclusive digital radio stations alongside their existing analogue radio stations. Broadcasters also state that DAB offers better reception, without the problems of interference that are more noticeable through analogue radio. DAB radios also come with features such as station lists, so listeners do not need to retune their receivers, as well as scrolling text, providing information such as breaking news, travel information or the latest track information.|$|E

There are many other SNP techniques {{that can be used}} depending on the purpose of the research considering throughput, data turnaround time, ease of use, performance (sensitivity, reliability, reproducibility, accuracy) flexibility, requirements, and cost. For highest throughput for large scale studies it is best to choose <b>multiplexed</b> chip-based <b>technology.</b> <b>Multiplex</b> <b>technologies</b> generate anywhere from 100 to over a million SNPs per run but are not economical to use for small to moderate numbers of SNPs.|$|R

40|$|Background: There is a {{need for}} {{reliable}} markers to diagnose active and latent tuberculosis (TB). The interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) are compared to the tuberculin skin test (TST) more specific, but cannot discriminate between recent or remote TB infection. Here the Flow-cytometric Assay for Specific Cell-mediated Immune-response in Activated whole blood (FASCIA), which quantifies expanded T-lymphoblasts by flow-cytometric analysis after long-term antigen stimulation of whole blood, is combined with cytokine/chemokine analysis in the supernatant by <b>multiplex</b> <b>technology</b> for diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. Methods and Findings: Consecutive patients with suspected TB (n = 85), with microbiologically verified active pulmonary TB (n = 33), extra pulmonary TB (n = 21), clinical TB (n = 11), presumed latent TB infection (LTBI) (n = 23), patients negative for TB (n = 8) and 21 healthy controls were studied.

40|$|Cancer is a {{multifaceted}} disease characterized by heterogeneous genetic alterations and cellular metabolism, at the organ, tissue, and cellular level. Key features of cancer hetero-geneity are summarized by 10 acquired capabilities, which govern malignant transformation and progression of invasive tumors. The relative contribution of these hallmark features {{to the disease}} process varies between cancers. At the DNA and cellular level, germ-line and somatic gene mutations are found across all cancer types, causing abnormal pro-tein production, cell behavior, and growth. The tumor microenvironment and its individual components (immune cells, fibroblasts, collagen, and blood vessels) can also facilitate or restrict tumor growth and metastasis. Oncology research is currently {{in the midst of}} a tremendous surge of comprehension of these disease mechanisms. This will lead not only to novel drug targets but also to new challenges in drug discovery. Integrated, multi-omic, <b>multiplexed</b> <b>technologies</b> are essential tools in the quest to understand all of the various cellular changes involved in tumorigenesis. This review examines features of cancer hetero-geneity and discusses how <b>multiplexed</b> <b>technologies</b> can facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of these features...|$|R

50|$|On July 31, 2009, KAXT began ATSC digital TV {{transmissions}} on UHF channel 42, {{which had}} been vacated by KTNC-TV. (The previous month, KTVU/KICU-TV owner Cox Enterprises unsuccessfully applied for a license {{to use the same}} frequency for a KTVU digital translator.) KAXT's digital transmissions used the call sign KAXT-LD, later KAXT-CD. The station was the first digital television station to broadcast 12 video streams on a standard 6 MHz 19.39 Mbit/s ATSC stream.

40|$|Targeting mitotic {{regulators}} as {{a strategy}} to fight cancer implies the development of drugs against key proteins such as Aurora A and B. Current drugs which target mitosis through a general mechanism of action (stabilization/destabilization of microtubules), have several side effects (neutropenia, alopecia, emesis). Pharmaceutical companies aim at avoiding these unwanted effects by generating improved and selective drugs that increase {{the quality of life}} of the patients. However, the development of these drugs is an ambitious task that involves testing thousands of compounds through biochemical and cell-based assays. In addition, molecules usually target complex biological processes, involving several proteins and different molecular pathways, further emphasizing the need for high-throughput screening techniques and <b>multiplexing</b> <b>technologies</b> in order to identify drugs with the desired phenotype. We will briefly describe two <b>multiplexing</b> <b>technologies</b> (high-content imaging, microarrays and flow cytometry) and two key processes for drug discovery research (assay development and validation) following our own published industry quality standards. We will further focus on high-content imaging as a useful tool for phenotypic screening and will provide a concrete example of high-content imaging assay to detect Aurora A or B selective inhibitors discriminating the off-target effects related to inhibition of other cell cycle or non-cell cycle key regulators. Finally, we will describe other assays that can help to characterize the in vitro pharmacology of the inhibitors...|$|R

50|$|StarGuide was the second-generation {{system of}} digital audio {{distribution}} via satellite. Many {{of the largest}} U.S. radio networks upgraded from or supplanted DATS/SEDAT audio feeds with StarGuide II and III audio receivers. The StarGuide platform is a proprietary MCPC digital audio distribution system that uses proprietary MX3 <b>multiplexing</b> <b>technology.</b> The StarGuide II receiver handles data rates from 512 kbit/s to 6.144 Mbit/s (in MX3 mode) and up to 8.192 Mbit/s in normal mode.

50|$|Because of {{the mistaken}} belief in some {{quarters}} of the spread spectrum community that little could be gained from receivers more sophisticated than the single-user matched filter, multiuser detection did not start developing until the early 1980s. Verdu showed that the near-far problem suffered by CDMA was not inherent to this <b>multiplexing</b> <b>technology</b> and could be overcome by an optimum receiver that demodulates all users simultaneously. Verdu's receiver consisted of a bank of matched filters followed by a Viterbi algorithm. In {{the context of the}} capacity of the narrowband Gaussian two-user multiple-access channel, Cover showed the achievability of the capacity region by means of a successive cancellation receiver, which decodes one user treating the other as noise, re-encodes its signal and subtracts it from the received signal. The same near-far resistance of the optimum receiver can be achieved with the decorrelating receiver proposed in. Adaptive multiuser detectors that do not require prior knowledge of the interfering waveforms have also been proposed.|$|E

30|$|The {{escalation}} of network traffic from {{the profusion of}} data centers and other cloud computing architectures have catalyzed numerous <b>multiplexing</b> <b>technologies</b> for enhancing the capacity of optical fiber networks and optimizing the optical spectrum. A recent technology for enabling Tb/s optical communications is mode division multiplexing (MDM), which leverages fiber modes as information carriers [1]. The potential of MDM lies in its prowess to break the nonlinear Shannon limit of conventional single-moded optical fiber transmission [2]. In MDM, specific mode or mode groups are used to transmit independent data signals in an optical fiber [3]. By controlling the excitation of modes, the impulse response of each channel may be optimized.|$|R
