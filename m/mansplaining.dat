2500|$|<b>Mansplaining</b> is a {{blend of}} the word man and the {{informal}} form splaining of the verb explaining and means [...] "to explain something to someone, characteristically by a man to woman, in a manner regarded as condescending or patronizing".

50|$|Part of {{the feminist}} version of the {{standpoint}} theory is a concept called ‘mansplaining.’ From a feminist point of view, <b>mansplaining</b> {{is defined as a}} male explaining something to a female in an incorrect and simple way. <b>Mansplaining</b> also makes the male who is doing the explaining seems overconfident about the topic and makes him seem condescending. It is even said that the concept that the man is explaining sometimes is something that the woman he is explaining it to already knew and that he may have even interrupted the woman who was first trying to explain it. It is not clear where this idea of <b>mansplaining</b> began but a common idea is that this kind of activity has been around for centuries. However, in more modern times the birth of the idea was in the year 2008 with Rebecca Solnit’s essay called “Men Explain Things To Me” which appeared in the Los Angeles Times. In this essay Solnit did not use the term <b>mansplaining</b> but talked about the experience she had where a male explained a book to her, which she had actually written. From there, the term slowly increased and gained popularity through feminist blogs. According to this idea, women are seen as inferior to men. Women are also seen as being a lot more interrupted by men because men just have the need to prove their point a lot more than women do. This concept says that men have the tendency to interrupt and that women have the tendency to be interrupted not only by men but by other women as well. Women have also been shown to accept being interrupted in a lot more of a kindly manner than men do. This may be drawn back to the point from this feminist concept that men see themselves as the ones who have the power and are inferior when it comes to explaining things. This goes along with the feminist view of the standpoint theory because feminist feel that women are seen as less powerful than men just because they are female and that if something needs to be explained correctly that men are the ones who take control and they explain it even when they are not really experts in that subject.On the other hand, others view this concept as problematic and stereotypical towards males as it makes all men seem like they are constantly trying to take control and that they seem like they know more than women do. One author explains that the term isn’t fair to explain men who highly support gender equality and this concept can also be seen as gender inequality.|$|E

50|$|The eponymous essay of {{this book}} focuses entirely on the {{silencing}} of women, specifically the idea that men seemingly believe {{that no matter what}} a woman says, a man always knows better. This phenomenon would later come to be called <b>mansplaining,</b> but in this essay Solnit describes how the silencing of female voices is an infringement on female liberty and is in fact an abuse of power. With an absence of credibility to female voices in the male mind issues like violent death, abuse, harassment, and rape are often discounted. In this way, she argues, female silencing is a dangerous phenomenon.|$|E

This creation of neologisms was called [...] "portmanbros" [...] by 2009. Oxford Dictionaries compared this trend to man- prefixes (e.g., man cave, <b>mansplaining,</b> manscaping) but noted that the bro portmanteaux subset refers to a smaller portion of masculinity. Oxford Dictionaries also noted that many of the terms were [...] "stunt coinages" [...] with little hope of widespread adoption. However, the term [...] "bromance", whose first usage was recorded in a 2001 issue of TransWorld Surf, entered the Oxford English Dictionary.

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper will}} offer {{a case study of}} the term ‘mansplaining’ as a concept that brings {{together}} feminist scholarship and online practices, revealing conflicts in both these areas. ‘Mansplaining’, a recent neologism used online, has not itself been theorised, but does owe a clear debt to feminist theory. ‘Mansplaining’ first appeared in 2008, and has no stable meaning. A popular online definition, however, describes it as "[not] just the act of explaining while male [ [...] . ]. <b>Mansplaining</b> is when a dude tells you, a woman, how to do something you already know how to do, or how you are wrong about something you are actually right about [ [...] . ]. Bonus points if he is explaining how you are wrong about something being sexist!" It is clear from this definition that ‘mansplaining’ relies on central but contentious feminist concepts such as standpoint and privilege. It also draws on feminist linguistics and their description of gender roles in conversation. Despite such roots, ‘mansplaining’ itself is hardly present in feminist scholarship. It is, however, extremely popular online as a way of naming gendered experience, both amongst feminists and more widely. The spread of ‘mansplaining’ can be attributed both to its foundations in feminist scholarship and to the appeal of naming something already existent in a new and provocative way. However, because ‘mansplaining’ is such a provocative term, it is also contentious, described by some as essentializing gendered behaviours. For this reason, and because of its origins in an online environment, the conceptual validity of the term is open to question. Of course, such questioning has larger consequences for contemporary feminist scholarship, in terms of its relation to activism and its online manifestations...|$|E
