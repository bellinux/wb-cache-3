5|$|Jerry {{inherits}} {{some old}} possessions {{of his grandfather}} Irving. Among them is a statue that looks just like one George's family had, until George broke it. Jerry promises that George can have it, but leaves it in his apartment for a few days. Kramer takes a few of Irving's old clothes, including a hat which he believes <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like Joe Friday of Dragnet. Elaine persuades Jerry to have his apartment cleaned by her client Rava's (Nurit Koppel) boyfriend Ray (Michael D. Conway). Jerry is very impressed {{by the quality of}} the cleaning; but when he and Elaine visit Rava, Jerry notices a statue with a vivid similarity to the one he inherited, and believes Ray stole it. He calls Kramer to check his apartment, and when Kramer cannot find the statue there, Jerry’s suspicion is confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood.

Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so.

500|$|For DmC: Devil May Cry, a reboot of the series, Dante was {{completely}} redesigned {{as a result}} of comments by the Capcom staff. Dante's original design was originally meant to be similar to the ones from previous games, but Capcom told the Ninja Theory staff it had to be completely different in order to appeal to a younger demographic. Motohide Eshiro stated this Dante {{was completely}} set apart from the previous Dantes which they expected would generate major criticism. While the original Dante was designed from a Japanese perspective, the new one was made from a Western perspective. After several drafts of Dante's new character, the designers settled on a look as inspired by Christopher Nolan's film The Dark Knight. Dante's coat is not long, only coming down to his lower-back, his hair is shorter and is black; he has a Devil Trigger form which <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> close to the classic Dante.

Also, he commented that Hitsugaya's unresolved personal issue is, along with the ones from others characters, a good part from the climax of the Soul Society story arc. He additionally praised the animation of Hitsugaya's bankai in the anime. Later, however, Kimlinger criticized it as [...] "it <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like an arthritic blue crow". IGN's Ramsey Isler lamented the fact that his first fight against an Arrancar was not very entertaining and his character did not [...] "get a chance to shine." [...] Hitsugaya's early appearances were criticized by Isaac Hale from Pop Culture Shock who found Kubo was ignoring other characters and giving a lot of attention to him and Matsumoto's gags. However, in a later arc, Chris Beveridge of Mania Entertainment noted he [...] "has a pretty good arc" [...] and [...] "shine brightly" [...] facing Aizen. His appearance in DiamondDust Rebellion were praised by Active Anime's Holly Ellingwood who found his motivations and back story [...] "involving and intriguing".

Tasha Robinson from SciFi.com remarked [...] "Kenshin's schizoid personal conflict between his ruthless-killer side and his country-bumpkin" [...] side was a perfect way to develop good stories {{which was one of}} the factors that made the series popular. Marco Oliveier from the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University said that the sakabatō symbolises Kenshin's oath not to kill again which has been found challenging by other warriors. Megan Lavey from Mania Entertainment highly praised Kenshin's characterization in the manga due to his seriousness as well how he intends to tell his friends his feelings contrasting some episodes from the anime where Kenshin is more comical. Lavey also highly praised the fight between Kenshin and Saito Hajime in the manga's seventh volume and Kenshin's killing intent displayed against his rival. Similarly, his first fight against Saito in the anime adaptation earned high praise by Anime News Network writer Mark A. Grey considering one of the best ones from the series.

Kirk Baird of The Blade [...] described the character as irresistible, while Columbus Alives Brad Keefe called him [...] "loveable". Georgie Hobbs of Little White Lies lauded Flynn as [...] "a hero invested with enough colour to liven up {{what could have}} been a monochromatic role". Margot Harrison of Seven Days concluded that the character is [...] "better than a prince". Meanwhile, Amy Nicholson of Inland Empire Weekly reviewed the character as a significant improvement upon traditional Disney heroes, writing, [...] "If anything, Tangled is hommepowerment—one more step forward in Disney's slow march to treat male suitors like equals, from its early nameless princes ... to here, a dude with a full-on personality and nearly equal screen time." [...] Tyler Hanley of the Palo Alto Weekly observed that [...] "Flynn talks in a laid-back way that helps make his character both likable and relatable". Ian Bunting of the Daily Record concluded that although [...] "Male characters sometimes get shortchanged in Disney movies ... Flynn is one of their better efforts to add to Aladdin, Mowgli and the Beast." [...] Virtually an equal amount of critics were less impressed with Flynn. Anthony Quinn of The Independent described the character as a [...] "fop", while Tom Huddleston of Time Out called him [...] "bland".

The Los Angeles TimesKenneth Turan believes that the film's [...] "initial shakiness" [...] is [...] "amplified by the irritating and overly glib nature of" [...] Flynn. Accusing the character of [...] "lacking both superficial and emotional individuality", Jake Coyle of the Southtown Star panned Flynn as [...] "rather obnoxious", Dan Kois of The Village Voice dismissed him as [...] "vanilla". Flynn's narration has also been widely panned. Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch referred to it as [...] "flippant". A. O. Scott of The New York Times described it as [...] "annoyingly smart-alecky". Justin Chang of Variety described the character's opening monologue as [...] "clunky". William Goss of Moviefone compared Flynn to [...] "a modern-day Chris Evans/Pine type, and his glib narration [...] combined with a hasty prologue [...] almost makes it feel like writer Dan Fogelman is trying too hard to make this a boys' AND girls' club". However, Goss relented, [...] "The voice-over tapers off, though, and Levi proves to be a suitably cocky foil to the neurotic love interest." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the dialogues Plato is {{most celebrated}} and admired for, Socrates is {{concerned}} with human and political virtue, has a distinctive personality, and friends and enemies who [...] "travel" [...] with him from dialogue to dialogue. This {{is not to say}} that Socrates is consistent: a man who is his friend in one dialogue may be an adversary or subject of his mockery in another. For example, Socrates praises the wisdom of Euthyphro many times in the Cratylus, but <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like a fool in the Euthyphro. He disparages sophists generally, and Prodicus specifically in the Apology, whom he also slyly jabs in the Cratylus for charging the hefty fee of fifty drachmas for a course on language and grammar. However, Socrates tells Theaetetus in his namesake dialogue that he admires Prodicus and has directed many pupils to him. Socrates' ideas are also not consistent within or between or among dialogues.|$|E
2500|$|Many critics blamed Paramount's initial ad {{campaign}} for the film not finding a mainstream audience.

(Don't be {{put off by the}} movie's cryptic poster, which <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like Michael J. Pollard.)" [...] The Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan also slammed the poster: [...] "The film's ad poster brings Elmer Fudd to mind." [...] Hanson said that the poster made Douglas look [...] "like he was trying to be Robin Williams". In an interview with Amy Taubin, Hanson said, [...] "The very things that made Michael and I want to do the movie so badly were the reasons it was so tricky to market. Since films go out on so many screens at once, there's a need for instant appeal. But Wonder Boys isn't easily reducible to a single image or a catchy ad line".|$|E
