500|$|The Los Angeles Times {{called the}} film [...] "a {{crackling}} thriller full {{of all sorts}} of gory treats... loaded with fuel-injected chase scenes, clever special effects and a sly humor." [...] The Milwaukee Journal gave the film 3 stars, calling it [...] "the most chilling science fiction thriller since Alien." [...] A review in Orange Coast magazine stated that [...] "the distinguishing virtue of The Terminator is its relentless tension. Right from the start it's all action and violence with no time taken to set up the story... It's like a streamlined Dirty Harry movie– no exposition at all; just guns, guns and more guns." [...] In the May 1985 issue of Cinefantastique it was referred to as a film that [...] "manages to be both derivative and original at the same time... not since The Road Warrior has the genre exhibited so <b>much</b> <b>exuberant</b> carnage" [...] and [...] "an example of science fiction/horror at its best... Cameron's no-nonsense approach will make him a sought-after commodity". In the United Kingdom the Monthly Film Bulletin praised the film's script, special effects, design and Schwarzenegger's performance.|$|E

50|$|The {{exterior}} is both {{grand and}} restrained, constructed of fine-grained, silver-white stone. The Gibbs-designed domes punctuate each corner. In line with Palladian conventions, the interiors are <b>much</b> more colourful, <b>exuberant</b> and opulent than the exteriors.|$|R
50|$|Henri Le Fauconnier {{had already}} in 1912 {{become a member}} of the Amsterdam Moderne Kunstkring (Modern Art Circle), {{together}} with Fernand Léger and Piet Mondriaan. A few years after the formation of the Bergense School in Groningen another School was formed in 1917-1918, called De Ploeg. Jan Wiegers was its central figure. De Ploeg also worked in an expressionist style, but its use of colour was <b>much</b> more <b>exuberant.</b> The group was notably influenced by the German Expressionism of Ernst Kirchner and its social outlook was influenced by the upcoming socialism.|$|R
60|$|The alloy came in {{the form}} of a low fever which smote down the stalwart Leo, reduced his great {{strength}} seriously, and confined him for many weeks to a couch in their little stone hut, and, of course, the power of sympathy robbed his companions of <b>much</b> of that <b>exuberant</b> joy which they shared with the lower animals at the advent of beautiful spring.|$|R
25|$|The {{kings of}} ancient Thamizhagam created sangams for Iyal Isai Nadagam (Literature, Music and Drama). Music {{played a major}} role in sangams. Music in Tamil Nadu had {{different}} forms. In villages where farming was the primary occupation, women who worked in the fields used to sing kulavai songs. Odhuvars, Sthanikars or Kattalaiyars offer short musical programmes in the temples by singing the devotional Thevaram songs. In sharp contrast with the restrained and intellectual nature of Carnatic music, Tamil folk music tends to be <b>much</b> more <b>exuberant.</b> Popular forms of Tamil folk music include the , a form of music performed with a bow, the urumee mellam or Naiyandi mellam which incorporates the use of the urumee and the , ballads that convey folklore and folk history.|$|R
50|$|The Chilean Coastal Range (Cordillera de la Costa) is a {{mountain}} range {{that runs from}} north to south along the Pacific coast of South America parallel to the Andean Mountains, extending from Morro de Arica in the north to Taitao Peninsula, where it ends at the Chile Triple Junction, in the south. The range has a strong influence on the climate of Chile since it produces a rain shadow to the east. Because of this the vegetation growing on the seaward slopes is <b>much</b> more <b>exuberant</b> than in the interior. Compared to the coastal lowlands and the Intermediate Depression it is sparsely populated with land use varying from protected areas to grazing and silviculture. The range is present in all Chilean regions except for Coquimbo Region and Magallanes Region.|$|R
40|$|Dendrite {{size and}} {{morphology}} are key determinants of the functional properties of neurons and neural circuits. Here {{we show that}} CD 40, {{a member of the}} TNF receptor superfamily, is a major regulator of dendrite growth and elaboration in the developing brain. The dendrites of hippocampal excitatory neurons were markedly stunted in Cd 40 -/- mice, whereas those of striatal inhibitory neurons were <b>much</b> more <b>exuberant.</b> These striking and opposite phenotypic changes were also observed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons cultured from Cd 40 -/- mice and were rescued by soluble CD 40. The changes in excitatory and inhibitory neurons cultured from Cd 40 -/- mice were mimicked in neurons of Cd 40 +/+ mice by treatment with soluble CD 40 L and were dependent on PKC-β and PKC-γ, respectively. These results suggest that CD 40 -activated CD 40 L reverse signalling has striking and opposite effects on the growth and elaboration of dendrites among major classes of brain neurons by PKC-dependent mechanisms...|$|R
50|$|The band evolves {{in a very}} {{conceptual}} universe, regulate by {{the adventures}} of Jon De Grimpclat, the dark hero from all their albums. Jon is a real dandy, dead languages professor, engaged into morbid extra-curricular activities, as he is a serial killer. However, he acts with certain ethical, {{in the name of}} justice, at least, his justice… He has lived a tragic childhood, losing his mother at the age of eight years, finding her dead downstairs in the family mansion. His father; remarried too soon and forsaking him because of his work (He is a fighter pilot); and his mother in law; with whom he has bad relations; don’t realize that the others children jeered at him, because he doesn’t talk <b>much,</b> and is <b>exuberant.</b>|$|R
5|$|The album's release {{coincided with}} Jarre's first foreign tour. In 1981 the British Embassy gave Radio Beijing copies of Oxygène and Équinoxe, {{which became the}} first pieces of foreign music to be played on Chinese {{national}} radio in decades. The republic invited Jarre {{to become the first}} western musician to play there, with Les Concerts en Chine. The performances were scheduled to run from 18 October to 5 November 1981. The first, in Beijing, was initially attended mostly by officials, but before the concert began technicians realised that not enough power was available to supply the stage and auditorium. Chinese officials solved the problem by temporarily cutting power to the surrounding districts. The stadium was almost full when the concert began, but as Beijing's buses stopped running at about 10 o'clock, about half the audience left before it finished. To boost the audience attendance for the second night, Jarre and his production team purchased some of the concert tickets and gave them to children on the streets (Jarre originally wanted the concerts to be free, but the Chinese authorities decided to charge between £0.20 and £0.50 per ticket). The event was notable for its lack of audience involvement; the Chinese were apparently unmoved by both the music and the light show, and applause was muted. The second venue, in Shanghai, was a different matter. Jarre actively encouraged audience participation by stepping into the crowd, which became <b>much</b> more <b>exuberant</b> than that in Beijing. Recordings of the concerts, which featured one of Jarre's signature electronic instruments, the laser harp, were released as a double-disc LP in 1982.|$|R
