In an attempt to separate these forcing factors, we generated palynological and organic geochemical records using a core spanning the OAE 2 from Wunstorf, Lower Saxony Basin (LSB; northern Germany), which exhibits cyclic black shale–marl alternations related to the orbital precession cycle. Despite the widely varying depositional conditions complicating {{the interpretation of the}} obtained records, TEX 86 H indicates that sea-surface temperature (SST) evolution in the LSB during OAE 2 resembles that of previously studied sites throughout the proto-North Atlantic. Cooling during the so-called Plenus Cold Event interrupted black shale deposition during the early stages of OAE 2. However, TEX 86 does not vary significantly across black shale–marl alternations, suggesting that temperature variations did not force the formation of the cyclic black shale horizons. Relative (i. e., with respect to marine palynomorphs) and absolute abundances of pollen and spores are elevated during phases of black shale deposition, indicative of enhanced precipitation and run-off. High abundances of cysts from inferred heterotrophic and euryhaline dinoflagellates supports high run-off, which likely introduced additional nutrients to the epicontinental shelf resulting in elevated <b>marine</b> <b>primary</b> <b>productivity.</b> We conclude that orbitally forced enhanced precipitation and run-off, in tandem with elevated <b>marine</b> <b>primary</b> <b>productivity,</b> were critical in cyclic black shale formation on the northern European epicontinental shelf and potentially for other OAE 2 sections in the proto-Atlantic and Western Interior Seaway at similar latitudes as well...|$|E

By combining GPS tracking and dive analyses on chick-rearing southern rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) with stable isotope analyses and monitoring of chick growth rates and chick survival, we here attempted a comprehensive assessment {{of the effects of}} inter-annual environmental variability as indicated by SST and chlorophyll a (reflecting <b>primary</b> <b>productivity)</b> data. Inter-annual differences in environmental variables around our study colony on New Island, Falkland/Malvinas Islands, contradicted the general expectation, with higher chlorophyll a concentrations coinciding with higher spring SST in 2010 / 2011 compared to 2009 / 2010. Penguins foraged further away from the colony during guard and crèche in 2010 / 2011 compared to 2009 / 2010, while performing deeper dives in 2009 / 2010. Stable isotope mixing models suggested a crustacean-dominated chick diet in 2009 / 2010, compared to a mixture of squid and fish in 2010 / 2011. These differences in foraging behaviour and diet, however, had no consequences for chick growth rates or chick survival and thus had no apparent effect on population trajectories. Potentially, environmental conditions in both years could still be seen as favourable compared to other years and breeding sites, enabling the parental birds to buffer the environmental differences by plastic foraging behaviour...|$|R

Using concurrent measurements of phytoplankton community structure, nitrate fluxes into the euphotic zone and productivity from a temperate coastal ecosystem, we find that observed productivities are best described by a population growth model in which the dominant species of the community approach their maximum growth rates. We interpret these results as evidence of species selection in communities containing a vast taxonomic repertory. The prevalence of selection effect was supported by open ocean data that show an increase in community dominance across a gradient of nutrient availability.

Depth and spatial variation of the maximum photosynthesis rate normalized to chlorophyll a (PBm) and the initial slope (α) of the PB-E curve parameters were insignificant in the East China Sea. The vertical homogeneity {{was due to the}} strong winter mixing. However, spatial homogeneity could be possibly caused by different factors. With relatively low solar radiation in the winter, strong vertical mixing deteriorated light dose and may lead to homogeneously low photosynthetic parameters. In addition, differential inhibitions by temperature and nutrient availability may potentially cause the spatial homogeneity. The mean values of PBm and α were 2. 82 ± 0. 50 gC (gChl) - 1 h- 1 and 0. 010 ± 0. 002 gC (gChl) - 1 h- 1 (μmol photons m- 2 s- 1) - 1, respectively.

The global chemistry transport model GEOS-Chem, implemented with an iron dissolution scheme, was applied to evaluate the atmospheric transport and deposition of mineral dust and bioavailable iron during two dust outbreaks originating in the source regions of Patagonia. In addition to this "rapidly released" iron, offline calculations were also carried out to estimate the amount of bioavailable iron leached during the residence time of dust in the ocean mixed layer. Model simulations showed that the horizontal and vertical transport pathways of Patagonian dust plumes were largely influenced by the synoptic meteorological patterns {{of high and low}} pressure systems. Model-predicted horizontal and vertical transport pathways of Patagonian dust over the SAO were in reasonable agreement with remotely-sensed data. Comparison between remotely-sensed and offline calculated ocean surface chlorophyll-a concentrations indicated that, for the two dust outbreaks examined in this study, the deposition of bioavailable iron in the SAO through atmospheric pathways was insignificant.

A look-up table of wavelength-integrated UV irradiance (280 - 400 nm) on the sea surface is established using the coupled ocean atmosphere radiative transfer (COART) model. On {{the basis of the}} look-up table, the distributions of the UV irradiance at middle and low latitudes are inversed by using the satellite-derived atmospheric products from the Aqua satellite, including aerosol optical thickness at 550 nm, ozone content, liquid water path, and the total precipitable water. The validation results show that the mean relative difference of the 10 d rolling averaged UV irradiance between the satellite retrieval and field observations is 8. 20 % at the time of satellite passing and 13. 95 % for the daily dose of UV. The monthly-averaged UV irradiance and daily dose of UV retrieved by satellite data show a good correlation with the in situ data, with mean relative differences of 6. 87 % and 8. 43 %, respectively. The sensitivity analysis of satellite inputs is conducted. The liquid water path representing the condition of cloud has the highest effect on the retrieval of the UV irradiance, while ozone and aerosol have relatively lesser effect.

Average model skill, as determined by root-mean square difference calculations, was lowest in the Black and Mediterranean Seas, highest in the pelagic North Atlantic and the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone, and intermediate in the other six regions. The maximum fraction of model skill that may be attributable to uncertainties in both the input variables and in situ NPP measurements was nearly 72 %. On average, the simplest depth/wavelength integrated models performed no worse than the more complex depth/wavelength resolved models. Ocean color models were not highly challenged in extreme conditions of surface chlorophyll-a and sea surface temperature, nor in high-nitrate low-chlorophyll waters. Water column depth was the primary influence on ocean color model performance such that average skill was significantly higher at depths greater than 250 m, suggesting that ocean color models are more challenged in Case- 2 waters (coastal) than in Case- 1 (pelagic) waters. Given that in situ chlorophyll-a data was used as input data, algorithm improvement is required to eliminate the poor performance of ocean color NPP models in Case- 2 waters that are close to coastlines.

The climate model simulations are based on greenhouse gas scenarios for the 21 st century and beyond. A shutdown of the THC, complete by 2150, is triggered if increased freshwater input from inland ice melt or enhanced runoff is assumed. The shutdown retards the greenhouse gas-induced atmospheric warming trend in the Northern Hemisphere, but does not lead to a persistent net cooling. Due to the simulated THC shutdown the sea level at the North Atlantic shores rises by up to 80 cm by 2150, in addition to the global sea level rise. This could potentially be a serious impact that requires expensive coastal protection measures. A reduction of <b>marine</b> net <b>primary</b> <b>productivity</b> is associated with the impacts of warming rather than a THC shutdown. Regional shifts in the currents in the Nordic Seas could strongly deteriorate survival chances for cod larvae and juveniles. This could lead to cod fisheries becoming unprofitable {{by the end of the}} 21 st century. While regional socioeconomic impacts might be large, damages would be probably small in relation to the respective gross national products. Terrestrial ecosystem productivity is affected much more by the fertilization from the increasing CO 2 concentration than by a THC shutdown. In addition, the level of warming in the 22 nd to 24 th century favours crop production in northern Europe a lot, no matter whether the THC shuts down or not. CO 2 emissions corridors aimed at limiting the risk of a THC breakdown to 10 % or less are narrow, requiring departure from business-as-usual in the next few decades. The uncertainty about THC risks is still high. This is seen in model analyses as well as in the experts' views that were elicited.

Here we present results from biogeochemical experiments showing that 1) volcanic ash from subduction zone volcanoes rapidly release an array of nutrients (co-) limiting algal growth in vast oceanic areas, 2) at a speed much faster (minute-scale) than hitherto known and that marine phytoplankton from low-iron oceanic areas can swiftly, within days, utilize iron from volcanic sources. We further present satellite data possibly indicating an increase of the MPP due to the seaward deposition of volcanic particulate matter. Our study supports the hypothesis that oceanic (iron) fertilization with volcanic ash may play a vital role for the development of the global climate.

40|$|In the winter-rain {{southern}} Atacama Desert of the Coquimbo Region of Chile, El Ni 1 o - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events modulate <b>primary</b> <b>productivity.</b> In this region, {{there are}} important changes in water availability between La Ni 1 a (dry) and El Ni 1 o (rainy) years. Using inter-annual comparisons of LANDSAT images from 30 ° to 31 ° S latitude, we observed changes in <b>primary</b> <b>productivity</b> between dry and rainy years at the regional level. There were also significant, negative correlations between productivity and elevation, with changes occurring first at low elevation during rainy years. The limiting factors to dryland vegetation <b>primary</b> <b>productivity</b> is different in regard to elevation. Rain during an El Ni 1 o year is the main factor that explains the increase in <b>primary</b> <b>productivity</b> at low elevation, while lower temperatures reduce and delay the net <b>primary</b> <b>productivity</b> at mid elevation...|$|R
