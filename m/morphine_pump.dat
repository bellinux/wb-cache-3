50|$|Christmas time {{signifies the}} last time the Williams’ family will all be {{together}} for a reason they would have under normal circumstances. At New Year’s, the family discusses funeral arrangements and the family passes a sleepless night. Terry continues to try to lift her mother’s spirits, dressing in bright, gregarious outfits each day to give her something to think about other than her ever-weakening spirit. The tension in the house grows as Dr. Smith shows them how to give Diane morphine, and her father snaps. He yells at Terry, telling her he doesn’t want to “deal with” his wife anymore: Terry can go home and leave the house that has become a hospital, but he can’t. Terry asks her mother if she and her husband should have a child, and she says that raising a child is the most beautiful part of life. Terry, on the other hand, doesn’t want to lose her solitude and remains ambivalent. She resolves to follow her feelings, a common theme of the book. Terry’s father comes home one day to a swarm of cars in the driveway, and he is infuriated once again. His emotions are the most evident, as he is not afraid to let loose. He shouts and tells everyone—mostly close relatives—to leave, even as Diane’s <b>morphine</b> <b>pump</b> beeps to signal an emergency. They untangle the tubes and Diane is fine, but this was the last experience we see of the family with their mother alive. As the mortician tries to prepares Diane’s body for the funeral, Terry has to remove the makeup from her mother’s face repeatedly. This is important because it signifies Terry’s love of what is pure and natural, not what others feel like they can do to improve it.|$|E

Materials and Methods: Single port Billroth I gastrectomy and cholecystectomy was performed using a transumbilical quadport. Flexible tipped camera and straight conventional instruments were used throughout the procedure. The stomach was mobilised including a limited lymph node dissection and resection margins in the proximal antrum and duodenum were divided with a flexible tipped laparoscopic stapler. The lesser curve was reconstructed and an intracorporal hand sewn two layer end-to-end anastomosis was performed using unidirectional barbed sutures. Intraoperative endoscopy confirmed the anastomosis to be patent without leak. Results: Enteral feed was started {{on the day of}} surgery, increasing to a full diet by day 6.

40|$|Background. Chronic pain as {{the result}} of {{long-term}} peripheral arterial disease and critical limb ischemia is difficult to manage and needs a multidisciplinary approach (pharmacological, psychological and functional) especially when the patient undergoes a lower limb amputation. Amputees show high rates of acute postoperative pain and chronic phantom limb pain in which there are few satisfactory available treatments. Nevertheless, it has been suggested for many years that continuous regional infusion of local anesthetic during immediate postoperative period is an effective and safe way of reducing these complications, morphine consumption and opioids-related adverse effects. However, data is conflicting as to its efficacy for both short-and log-term outcomes. Objective. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate whether a continuous postoperative perineural infusion system with bupivacaine is effective in reduction of postoperative acute pain and morphine intake during the first 72 hours post-amputation period, and also if it has some benefice in reducing the incidence of long-term phantom limb pain and stump pain Design.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} intrathecal morphine on pulmonary function, analgesia, and morphine plasma concentrations after cardiac surgery. INTRODUCTION: Lung dysfunction increases morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery. Regional analgesia may improve pulmonary outcomes by reducing pain, but the occurrence of this benefit remains controversial. METHODS: Forty-two patients were randomized for general anesthesia (control group n= 22) or 400 µg of intrathecal morphine followed by general anesthesia (morphine group n= 20). Postoperative analgesia was accomplished with an intravenous, patient-controlled <b>morphine</b> <b>pump.</b> Blood gas measurements, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume (FEV), and FVC/FEV ratio were obtained preoperatively, {{as well as on}} the first and second postoperative days. Pain at rest, profound inspiration, amount of coughing, morphine solicitation, consumption, and plasma morphine concentration were evaluated for 36 hours postoperatively. Statistical analyses were performed using the repeated measures ANOVA or Mann-Whiney tests (*p< 0. 05). RESULTS: Both groups experienced reduced FVC postoperatively (3. 24 L to 1. 38 L in control group; 2. 72 L to 1. 18 L in morphine group), with no significant decreases observed between groups. The two groups also exhibited similar results for FEV 1 (p= 0. 085), FEV 1 /FVC (p= 0. 68) and PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio (p= 0. 08). The morphine group reported less pain intensity (evaluated using a visual numeric scale), especially when coughing (18 hours postoperatively: control group= 4. 73 and morphine group= 1. 80, p= 0. 001). Cumulative morphine consumption was reduced after 18 hours in the morphine group (control group= 20. 14 and morphine group= 14. 20 mg, p= 0. 037).

Methods: This prospective, randomized control trial was conducted on 75 patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists' physical status I or II undergoing microdiscectomy. Patients in all the three groups received morphine 1 mg IV, with a lockout period of 10 min after each bolus, and the maximum allowed dose was 15 mg/ 5 h postoperatively. Patients in Group A received CWI with 0. 25 % levobupivacaine 20 mL as bolus after extubation followed by infusion at 5 mL/h. Group B received CEI with 0. 25 % levobupivacaine at 5 mL/h. Patients in Group C received intravenous (IV) <b>morphine</b> by PCA <b>pump</b> only. The primary end points were static and dynamic visual analogue scores (VAS) and postoperative pain scores. Secondary observations were postoperative morphine consumption at 8 h, 24 h and 48 h, and patient satisfaction. Results: Group A showed greater analgesic effects at 12 h (P < 0. 02), 24 h (P < 0. 03), 36 h (P < 0. 008) and 48 h (P < 0. 007) {{when compared to the}} other two techniques, as pain scores were less in group A as compared to group B and C. The requirement of postoperative intravenous morphine (mg) was 18 ± 12. 82, 22. 92 ± 9. 88, 41. 56 ± 8. 83 for groups A, B and C after 48 h (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Continuous wound infiltration is an effective postoperative pain control technique with minimal side effects, after spinal surgery...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{continuous}} femoral nerve {{block is}} frequently {{used as an}} adjunct therapy after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, there is still debate on its benefits. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized study, patients received a basic analgesic regimen of paracetamol and dicloflenac for the first 48 h postoperatively. In addition, the study group received a continuous femoral nerve block. A <b>morphine</b> patient-controlled analgesia <b>pump</b> was also available as a rescue analgesic to all the patients. Patients' numeric rating scores for pain, the amount of morphine consumed and its side effects during the first 48 h were recorded. Knee flexion angles achieved {{during the first week}} were registered. Three months postoperatively, patients completed Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and Knee Society Score. RESULTS: The study group (n= 27) had less pain (P= 0. 0016) during the first 48 h, was more satisfied with the analgesia (P< 0. 001) and used less morphine (P= 0. 007) compared with the control group (n= 26). Fewer patients were nauseated, vomited or were drowsy in the study group (P= 0. 001). Also, the study group achieved better knee flexion in the first 6 days after surgery (P= 0. 001), with more patients reaching 90 degrees flexion than the control group. However, after 3 months, there were no significant functional differences between the groups. CONCLUSION: A continuous femoral nerve block leads to better analgesia, less morphine consumption and less morphine-related side effects after TKA. Early functional recovery is improved, resulting in more patients reaching 90 degrees knee flexion after 6 days. However, after 3 months, no significant functional benefits were found...|$|R
40|$|Background: Opiate {{is used in}} patient-controlled {{intravenous}} analgesia pumps (PCIA) for controlling pain in post-surgical patients. Other drugs are remarkably added to opioid pumps to enhance quality, lengthen analgesia, and reduce side effects. Lidocaine, a local anesthetic which inhibits sodium channels, has anesthetic and analgesic effects when injected locally or intravenously. The objective {{of this study is}} to evaluate the analgesic effects of adding lidocaine 1 % to different doses of <b>morphine</b> via IV <b>pump</b> to patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) after orthopedic surgeries. Materials and Methods: In a randomized clinical trial, 60 patients who had undergone orthopedic surgery of lower extremities were divided into three equal groups to control postoperative pain. Intravenous pump with 5 ml/h flow rate was used as the analgesic method. The solution consisted of lidocaine 1 % plus 20 mg morphine for the first group, lidocaine 1 % plus 10 mg morphine for the second group, and only 20 mg morphine for the third group (control group). Patients were checked every 12 h, and Visual Analog Scale (VAS), extra opioid doses, nausea/vomiting, and sedation scale were examined. Results: Pain score was lower in the first group compared to the other two groups. Mean VAS was 2. 15 ± 0. 2, 2. 75 ± 0. 2, and 2 ± 0. 25 on the first day and 1. 88 ± 0. 1, 2. 74 ± 0. 3, and 2. 40 ± 0. 3 on the second day, respectively, in the three groups and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0. 01 and < 0. 05, respectively). Also, 10 % of patients in the first group needed extra opioid doses, while this figure was 30 % in the second group and 25 % in the third group (P < 0. 01). Nausea/vomiting and sedation scores were not statistically different among the three groups. Conclusion: Compared to lidocaine 1 % plus 10 mg morphine or 20 mg morphine alone in PCIA, adding lidocaine 1 % to 20 mg morphine decreases the pain score and opioid dose after orthopedic surgeries without having side effects...|$|R
5000|$|The {{first known}} hospital-based {{ambulance}} service was based out of Commercial Hospital, Cincinnati, Ohio, (now the Cincinnati General) by 1865. This was soon followed by other services, notably the New York service provided out of Bellevue Hospital. Edward Dalton, a former surgeon in the Union Army, {{was charged with}} creating a hospital in lower New York; he started an ambulance service to bring the patients to the hospital faster and in more comfort, a service which started in 1869. These ambulances carried medical equipment, such as splints, a stomach <b>pump,</b> <b>morphine,</b> and brandy, reflecting contemporary medicine. Dalton believed that speed was of the essence, and at first the horses were kept in harness while awaiting a call: {{within a few months}} this practice had been replaced with a 'drop,' or 'snap,' harness arrangement, whereby the tack was lowered by pulley from the ceiling straight onto the horse: under either scheme, ambulances were ready to go within 30 seconds of being called. The service was very popular and grew rapidly, with the year 1870 seeing the ambulances attend 1401 emergency calls, but twenty-one years later, this had more than tripled to 4392. For the first week of their operation, the ambulances were crewed by the hospital's house-staff, after which the hospital hired Drs. Duncan Lee and Robert Taylor as full-time ambulance surgeons; going forward, the plan was to crew the ambulances with fresh graduates of Bellevue's surgical training program, who would serve for six-month terms and be replaced by new hires from successive graduating classes. [...] This scheme foundered immediately, however, when graduates balked at the schedule and the salary offered: $50 a month, twelve-hour shifts, and one day off every four weeks. Instead, by the end of 1869, the system of staffing the ambulance with residents in training (who could simply be assigned, rather than having to be recruited) was firmly established. As late as 1935, these interns were earning the same $50 a month their grandfathers had received.|$|R
40|$|Background:In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} a continuous wound infusion with ropivacaine 0. 3 % on pain and morphine consumption after minimally invasive hip arthroplasty. Methods:Seventy-six consecutive patients scheduled for elective minimally invasive hip replacement using spinal anesthesia were prospectively included in this double-blind study. Epicapsular placement of a 15 -cm fenestrated catheter was performed by the surgeon. Patients were randomized to receive either 20 mL ropivacaine 0. 3 % (R-group) or 20 mL NaCl 0. 9 % (P-group) applied into the wound as a bolus before wound closure. A continuous infusion of either ropivacaine 0. 3 % or placebo was then infused at 8 mL/h for 48 hours after surgery with an elastomeric <b>pump.</b> <b>Morphine</b> IV-patient-controlled analgesia was offered to all patients. Morphine consumption, pain at rest and with motion, and total and unbound ropivacaine plasma concentration were recorded during the 48 -hour study period. Postoperative follow-up was performed at 3 months. Results:Demographic and surgical data were similar in both groups. Mean morphine consumption was significantly lower in the R-group than in the P-group during the first 48 postoperative hours: 45. 4 ± 9. 5 vs 69. 7 ± 9. 6 (P < 0. 0001). There was a mean reduction of 14. 4 mg for the first 24 postoperative hours (95 % confidence interval [CI] 12. 6 to 16. 1) and 20. 8 mg for the next 24 hours (95 % CI 19. 1 to 22. 4). Pain scores at rest and with motion were lower in the R-group (P < 0. 0001). Mean patient satisfaction increased 22. 7 % from baseline (CI 95 % 15. 9 to 29. 6) in the R-group. Total and unbound ropivacaine plasma concentrations were below toxic levels in the R-group. The free ropivacaine concentration was 0. 14 and 0. 11 μgmol/L at T(24) and T(48), respectively, in the R-group. At 3 months postoperatively, hip pain and analgesic consumption were similar, but a significant reduction in wound discomfort to touch (31. 2; 95 % CI 27. 7 to 34. 7) and pressure (24; 95 % CI 20. 1 to 27. 9) was observed in the R-group (P < 0. 0001). Conclusions:Continuous epicapsular wound infusion with ropivacaine 0. 3 % after minimally invasive hip replacement is an efficient technique for reducing morphine consumption and improving the quality of postoperative analgesia. The beneficial effects of this technique are still present 3 months after surgery...|$|R
