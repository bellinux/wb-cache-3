Primed mice with plasmid DNA encoding Plasmodium yoelii circumsporozoite surface protein (PyCSP), then boosted with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the same protein had significantly higher levels of antibody, CTL activity and IFN-γ, and hence higher levels of protection, than mice immunized and boosted with plasmid DNA alone. This can be further enhanced by priming with a mixture of plasmids encoding PyCSP and murine GM-CSF, before boosting with recombinant vaccinia virus. An effective prime-boost strategy for the simian malarial model P. knowlesi has also been demonstrated. Rhesus monkeys were primed with a multicomponent, multistage DNA vaccine encoding two liver-stage antigens – the circumsporozoite surface protein (PkCSP) and sporozoite surface protein 2 (PkSSP2) – and two blood stage antigens – the apical <b>merozoite</b> <b>surface</b> <b>protein</b> 1 (PkAMA1) and <b>merozoite</b> <b>surface</b> <b>protein</b> 1 (PkMSP1p42).

50|$|Blocking {{antibodies}} have {{a variety}} of functions on the merozoite form of parasitic malaria. While in the merozoite form, malaria parasites invade erythrocytes and reproduce in them. Some blocking antibodies may inhibit the invasion of erythrocytes, while other blocking antibodies prevent the binding of inhibitory antibodies, allowing merozoite invasion of erythrocytes despite the presence of inhibitory antibodies. The monoclonal antibodies that prevent the invasion of merozoites bind to the parasitic antigen MSP-1 (<b>merozoite</b> <b>surface</b> <b>protein</b> 1). The binding of blocking antibodies to MSP-1 is shown to result in the inhibition of secondary processing, resulting in the inability for merozoites to invade host erythrocytes. Secondary processing involves a single proteolytic cleavage on the merozoite surface of the carboxy-terminal component of MSP-1. The blocking of MSP-1 has been proposed to be a method of creating a vaccine against malaria by preventing its invasion and multiplication.|$|E

40|$|Background: Two related <b>merozoite</b> <b>surface</b> <b>proteins,</b> MSP 3 and MSP 6, have {{previously}} {{been identified as}} targets of antibody-dependent cellular inhibition (ADCI), a protective mechanism against Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Both MSP 3 and MSP 6 share a common characteristic small N-terminal signature amino-acid stretch (NLRNA/G), a feature similar to MSP 3 -like orthologs identified in other human and primate malaria parasites. Methods/Results: This signature amino-acid sequence led to the identification of eight ORFs contiguously located on P. falciparum chromosome 10. Our subsequent investigations on their expression, localization, sequence conservation, epitope sharing, immunogenicity and the functional role of antibodies in defense are reported here. Six members of P. falciparum MSP 3 -multigene family share similar sequence organization within their C-terminal regions, are simultaneously expressed as <b>merozoite</b> <b>surface</b> <b>proteins</b> and are highly conserved among parasite isolates. Each of these proteins is a target of naturally occurring antibodies effective at parasite killing in ADCI assays.

40|$|Malaria is a {{major threat}} to human health. It is caused by Plasmodium s-pp., a {{protozoan}} parasite that belongs to the phylum Apicomplexa. Malaria parasites have a complicated life cycle and clinical symptoms occur during replication of the parasite in erythrocytes. Plasmodium falciparum subtilisin-like serine protease 1 (PfSUB 1) belongs to the subtilisin-like family of serine proteases (subtilases). It is encoded by a single copy gene and is translated as a protein with a molecular mass of about 78 kDa. Attempts to disrupt the gene have not been successful, indicating an essential role in the intraerythrocytic life cycle of the parasite. Recent studies have shown that PfSUB 1 is discharged into the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) {{in the final stages of}} schizont maturation to mediate proteolytic maturation of an abundant PV protein called SERA 5. In this project, an examination of the SERA 5 processing sites along with the use of a small library of internally quenched fluorogenic peptides, revealed a consensus PfSUB 1 substrate recognition motif that showed a striking resemblance to all known primary processing sites in <b>merozoite</b> <b>surface</b> <b>proteins.</b> The role of PfSUB 1 in these processing events was therefore examined. The results showed that PfSUB 1 is responsible for the proteolytic processing of <b>merozoite</b> <b>surface</b> <b>proteins</b> 1, 3, 6 and 7 that takes place in the final stages of schizont maturation. Different strategies to obtain a knock-down of the pfsub 1 gene by means of reverse genetics were also attempted. Mutagenesis studies were performed to study the structural characteristics of PfSUB 1 that are responsible for its substrate specificity, and in an attempt to optimise the expression of soluble recombinant PfSUB 1 for future crystallographic studies. The results obtained identify PfSUB 1 as a multifunctional processing protease of the malarial PV that plays a key role in both egress and proteolytic remodelling of the developing merozoite in preparation for its release from the confines of the infected cell.
