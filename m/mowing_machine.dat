5|$|After Urilla's death, Wyatt {{went through}} a {{downward}} spiral and {{had a series of}} legal problems. On March 14, 1871, Barton County filed a lawsuit against Earp and his sureties. Earp was in charge of collecting license fees for Lamar, which funded local schools, and he was accused of failing to turn in the fees. On March 31, James Cromwell filed a lawsuit against Earp, alleging that Earp had falsified court documents about the amount of money collected from Cromwell to satisfy a judgment. To make up the difference between what Earp turned in and Cromwell owed (which he claimed to have paid), the court seized Cromwell's <b>mowing</b> <b>machine</b> and sold it for $38. Cromwell's suit claimed that Earp owed him $75, the estimated value of the machine.|$|E

Nickerson requested sturdy wagons, and while some of those supplied proved inadequate, tribal operations used 80 wagons by 1881 (as well as 7 <b>mowing</b> <b>machines</b> and 5 sulky hay rakes and many smaller implements). By August 1889, 20 tribal teams worked year-round to supply both private and commercial needs in the rapidly growing county.|$|R

In 1911, when their European Russian equivalents were still threshing their grain by hand, Siberian Russians had an impressive collection of 37,000 <b>mowing</b> <b>machines</b> and 39,000 horse-drawn rakes. Siberians were using a full 25% of the Agricultural machinery in the country, which was part of the reason that grain production exploded in this period.|$|R
60|$|During {{the summer}} of my eighth year, I took a part in haying and harvest, and I have a painful {{recollection}} of raking hay after the wagons, for I wore no shoes and the stubble was very sharp. I used to slip my feet along close to the ground, thus bending the stubble away from me before throwing my weight on it, otherwise walking was painful.

[...] Situated on an ancient lake bed surrounded by hills, the valley with fertile meadows was excellent for farming. The Ashuelot River provided water power for sawmills, gristmills and tanneries.

50|$|The Roaring Twenties {{brought a}} {{sustained}} period of economic prosperity principally to North America, {{but also to}} London, Berlin and Paris, {{with the end of}} the Depression of 1920-21 in the U.S. and a robust American economy. For agriculture, the tariff raised the purchasing power of the farmers by two to three percent, with other industries raising the price of some farm equipment. In September 1926, economic statistics were released by farming groups that revealed the rising cost of farm machinery. For example, the average cost of a harness rose from $46 in 1918 to $75 in 1926, the 14-inch plow doubled in cost from $14 to $28, <b>mowing</b> <b>machines</b> went from $45 to $95, and farm wagons from $85 to $150.|$|R

60|$|I {{may as well}} {{begin this}} story with Mr. Hilary Vane, more {{frequently}} addressed as the Honourable Hilary Vane, although it was the gentleman's proud boast {{that he had never}} held an office in his life. He belonged to the Vanes of Camden Street,--a beautiful village in the hills near Ripton,--and was, in common with some other great men who had made a noise in New York and the nation, a graduate of Camden Wentworth Academy. But Mr. Vane, when he was at home, lived on a wide, maple-shaded street in the city of Ripton, cared for by an elderly housekeeper who had more edges than a new-fangled <b>mowing</b> <b>machine.</b> The house was a porticoed one which had belonged to the Austens for a hundred years or more, for Hilary Vane had married, towards middle age, Miss Sarah Austen. In two years he was a widower, and he never tried it again; he had the Austens' house, and that many-edged woman, Euphrasia Cotton, the Austens' housekeeper.|$|E
60|$|I {{was born}} in September, and love it best of all the months. There is no heat, no hurry, no thirst and weariness in corn harvest {{as there is in}} the hay. If the season is late, as is usual with us, then mid-September sees the corn still {{standing}} in stook. The mornings come slowly. The earth is like a woman married and fading; she does not leap up with a laugh for the first fresh kiss of dawn, but slowly, quietly, unexpectantly lies watching the waking of each new day. The blue mist, like memory in the eyes of a neglected wife, never goes from the wooded hill, and only at noon creeps from the near hedges. There is no bird to put a song in the throat of morning; only the crow's voice speaks during the day. Perhaps there is the regular breathing hush of the scytheâ€”even the fretful jar of the <b>mowing</b> <b>machine.</b> But next day, in the morning, all is still again. The lying corn is wet, and when you have bound it, and lift the heavy sheaf to make the stook, the tresses of oats wreathe round each other and droop mournfully.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a UAV based {{remote sensing system}} {{for the detection of}} fawns in the meadows. There is a high demand because during pasture mowing many wild animals, especially roe deer fawns are killed by <b>mowing</b> <b>machines.</b> The system was tested in several real situations especially with diï¬€ering weather and iluminating conditions. Its primary sensor is a lightweight thermal infrared camera. The images are captured onboard of the ï¬‚ight system and also transmitted as analog video stream to the ground station, where the user can follow the camera live stream on a monitor for manual animal detection. Beside a high detection rate a fast workï¬‚ow is another very important objective for this application. Therefore a waypoint planning software was developed that accelerates the workï¬‚ow. At adequate illuminating and weather conditions the presented UAV-based fawn detection via thermal imaging is a comfortable, fast and reliable method...|$|R
500|$|Following {{instructions}} from Ottawa, French finally agreed with Morris that the expedition would initially follow the trail, but then would steer {{away from the}} border and Sioux territory, and the mounted police finally left Dufferin on July 8, 1874.

40|$|<b>Machine</b> <b>mowing,</b> {{mimicking}} the traditional hand mowing, {{is often used}} as a successful management tool to maintain grassland biodiversity, but few studies have investigated {{the long-term effects of}} traditional versus mechanical mowing of plant communities. <b>Machine</b> <b>mowing</b> as opposed to hand mowing causes soil compaction and reduction of soil aeration. In response, we expected strong effects on below-ground plant traits: root aerenchyma formation and superficial root growth, and no specific effects on aboveground traits. Effects were expected to be more pronounced in soils vulnerable to compaction. We evaluated the changes in above- and belowground plant traits in a long-term (38 -year) experiment with annual hand-mowing and machine-mowing management regimes on two different soil types: a coarse structured sandy soil and a finer structured sandy-organic soil Only on the organic soil, long-term <b>machine</b> <b>mowing</b> leads to lower soil aeration (more compacted soil) and a marked change in the belowground trait distribution of the plant community. Here we find a higher cover of superficially rooting species and marginally significant lower cover of species without morphological adaptations to soil hypoxia, but no effect on species with a high capacity of forming aerenchyma. <b>Mowing</b> with heavy <b>machines</b> on soils vulnerable to compaction affect the vegetation according to changes in soil physical conditions. This is reflected in a shift towards communities with greater proportion of superficially rooting species. Our results illustrate the sensitivity of grasslands to slight changes in the management regime. ...|$|R

5000|$|Before the {{invention}} of <b>mowing</b> <b>machines</b> in 1830, lawns were managed very differently. They were an element of wealthy estates and manor houses, and in some places were maintained by the labor-intensive methods of scything and shearing. In most situations, they were also pasture land maintained through grazing by sheep or other livestock. Areas of grass grazed regularly by rabbits, horses or sheep {{over a long period}} often form a very low, tight sward similar to a modern lawn. This was the original meaning of the word [...] "lawn", and the term can still be found in place names. Some forest areas where extensive grazing is practiced still have these seminatural lawns. For example, in the New Forest, England, such grazed areas are common, and are known as lawns, for example Balmer Lawn. Lawns similar to those of today first appeared in France and England in the 1700s when AndrÃ© Le NÃ´tre designed the gardens of Versailles that included a small area of grass called the , or [...] "green carpet".|$|R

40|$|Using {{radiotelemetry}} I investigated {{magnitude and}} main causes of neonatal mortality of the European roe deer Capreolus capreolus in two long-term studies (EkenÃ¤s 1986 - 1999, Bogesund 1997 - 2003) in central Sweden. Summer mortality was 51 and 52 % {{in the two}} areas, respectively, and predation by red fox Vulpes vulpes accounted for 88 % of the mortality in both areas.
