5|$|The {{origins of}} Kenneth are {{believed}} to have been from a tropical wave that crossed Central America into the eastern North Pacific Ocean on September 9. The system tracked westward within the Intertropical Convergence Zone — a belt of thunderstorm activity across the eastern Pacific Ocean — and on September 13 its associated thunderstorm activity began showing signs of organization. Despite being located only 625miles (1010km) east-southeast of the larger Tropical Depression Ten, the National Hurricane Center remarked the potential for further development of the system; as the depression was further west and <b>moving</b> <b>faster</b> than the system, little interference from Jova was anticipated. The system organized further, and at 1800UTC on September 14 the National Hurricane Center began classifying it as Tropical Depression Eleven about 900miles (1450km) west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The depression maintained a general westward track throughout its entire duration, due to the subtropical ridge to its north.|$|E
5|$|The {{two ships}} opened fire just before 18:00 {{at a range}} of about , with Shannon scoring the first hit, {{striking}} Chesapeake {{on one of her}} forward gunports with two round shot and a bag of musket balls fired by William Mindham, the gun captain of the aftmost of Shannons starboard 18-pounders. Chesapeake was <b>moving</b> <b>faster</b> than Shannon, and as she ranged {{down the side of the}} British ship, the destruction inflicted by the precise and methodical gunnery of the British crew moved aft with the American's forward gun crews suffering the heaviest losses. However, the American crew were well drilled and, despite their losses, returned fire briskly. As Chesapeake was heeling, many of their shots struck the water or waterline of Shannon causing little damage, but American carronade fire caused serious damage to Shannons rigging. In particular, a 32-pound carronade ball struck the piled shot for the Shannons 12-pounder gun that was stowed in the main chains; the shot was propelled through the timbers to scatter like hail across the gundeck.|$|E
25|$|The {{problems}} {{involved are}} not always so trivial. Special relativity predicts that an observer in an inertial reference frame doesn't see objects he would describe as <b>moving</b> <b>faster</b> {{than the speed of}} light. However, in the non-inertial reference frame of Earth, treating a spot on the Earth as a fixed point, the stars are observed to move in the sky, circling once about the Earth per day. Since the stars are light years away, this observation means that, in the non-inertial reference frame of the Earth, anybody who looks at the stars is seeing objects which appear, to them, to be <b>moving</b> <b>faster</b> than the speed of light.|$|E

25|$|As in all Macronaria, the forelimbs of brachiosaurids {{are long}} {{relative}} to the hindlimbs, but this trait is more pronounced in brachiosaurids. The forelimbs were very slender for a sauropod and the metacarpal bones of the forelimb were elongated. These adaptations overall increased the stride length of the forelimbs, arguably resulting in an uneven gait. However, it was previously argued that they were hindlimb dominant like other sauropods, and thus {{had the ability to}} rear up on their hindlimbs. Based on the structure of their legs, making it impossible for them to run, it is likely that they moved about in a low walking speed (20–40km/day), but were capable of <b>moving</b> <b>faster</b> when necessary, up to 20–30km/hour, depending on leg length.|$|E

25|$|Orbital decay {{can occur}} due to tidal forces for objects below the {{synchronous}} orbit {{for the body}} they're orbiting. The gravity of the orbiting object raises tidal bulges in the primary, and since below the synchronous orbit the orbiting object is <b>moving</b> <b>faster</b> than the body's surface the bulges lag a short angle behind it. The gravity of the bulges is slightly off of the primary-satellite axis and thus has a component along the satellite's motion. The near bulge slows the object more than the far bulge speeds it up, {{and as a result}} the orbit decays. Conversely, the gravity of the satellite on the bulges applies torque on the primary and speeds up its rotation. Artificial satellites are too small to have an appreciable tidal effect on the planets they orbit, but several moons in the solar system are undergoing orbital decay by this mechanism. Mars' innermost moon Phobos is a prime example, and is expected to either impact Mars' surface or break up into a ring within 50 million years.|$|E

Bill Roe, director of photography, and Rob Bowman were tasked with lighting the entire structure for the episode's teaser and climax, a job that Spotnitz later called [...] "amazing".
