5|$|The {{importance}} of 'joint' warfare was <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> the Australian military during World War II when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served {{as part of}} single commands. Following the war, several senior officers lobbied for {{the appointment of a}} {{commander in chief of the}} three services. The government rejected this proposal and the three services remained fully independent. The absence of a central authority resulted in poor co-ordination between the services, with each service organising and operating on the basis of a different military doctrine.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{successful}} collaboration on the pitch, {{a strong}} personal rivalry developed between Ramsey and Nicholson, partly because both {{liked the idea}} of staying on at Tottenham in a coaching role after retiring. Rowe <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Ramsey that he wanted him to do so, but unfortunately for him Rowe stepped down in February 1955, citing health issues. Another challenge to Ramsey's position at Tottenham {{came in the form of}} Danny Blanchflower, a Northern Ireland international wing-half signed from Aston Villa to replace Nicholson. Blanchflower was a more attacking player than Nicholson and thus did not provide the necessary cover for Ramsey to advance upfield; Ramsey also resented the idea that Blanchflower might supplant him as Tottenham's main strategist.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{capitulation}} of Germany in November 1918, {{most of the}} High Seas Fleet ships, {{under the}} command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Prior to the departure of the German fleet, Admiral Adolf von Trotha <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> von Reuter that he could not allow the Allies to seize the ships, under any conditions. The fleet rendezvoused with the British light cruiser , which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive flotilla consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships. Once the ships were interned, their guns were disabled through the removal of their breech blocks, and their crews were reduced to 200 officers and enlisted men.|$|E

He was convinced that the conquest of the Chinese capital city of Nanking would provoke the fall of the entire Nationalist Government of China and thus hand Japan a quick and complete victory in its war on China. Yanagawa was likewise eager to conquer Nanking and both men chafed under the operation restriction line that had been imposed on them by the Army General Staff.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} two {{decades of the twentieth}} century the Indiana Anti-Saloon League (IASL), formed in 1898 as a state {{auxiliary}} of the national Anti-Saloon League, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union successfully organized pressure on Indiana politicians, especially members of the Republican party, to support the dry cause. The IASL, although not the first organization to take up the dry crusade in Indiana, became a key force behind efforts at attaining passage of statewide prohibition in early 1917, and rallied state support for ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1919. The IASL's success, under the leadership of Edward S. Shumaker, an ordained Methodist minister, made it a model for the League's other state organizations. Shumaker <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> politicians he did not care whether they drank, but insisted they vote for dry laws or face defeated in the next election by dry voters.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Armistice between Germany and the Allies that ended World War I, the {{majority}} of the German fleet was to be interned at Scapa Flow; this included Hindenburg {{and the rest of the}} battlecruisers. On 21 November 1918, the ships to be interned—14 capital ships, seven light cruisers, and 50 of the most modern torpedo boats—departed German waters for what would prove to be the last time. Prior to the departure of the German fleet, Admiral Adolf von Trotha <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, who was given command of the ships to be interned, that he could not allow the Allies to seize the ships, under any conditions.

5|$|According to the Venetian senator Andrea Suriano, Venice {{spent on}} average 60,000 ducats {{per year in}} this {{seemingly}} fruitless conflict, but the Venetians themselves were hesitant to commit their resources fully to Thessalonica; its proximity to the centre of Ottoman power made their ability to retain it doubtful in the long term, {{while at the same}} time, closer to home, Venice was pursuing a conflict with the Duchy of Milan over control of northern Italy. The Republic had long tried to avoid declaring war on the Ottomans, but now it had little choice: Dandolo's imprisonment, the increasing Ottoman naval threat (with the open assistance of the Genoese colonies at Chios and Lesbos), in conjunction with the end of their war with Hungary, <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> the Venetians that the Sultan was preparing to settle the question of Thessalonica by force. As a result, on 29 March 1429, the Great Council voted an official declaration of war against the Sultan, and ordered more ships to be activated to join the fleet.|$|E

5|$|Claiborne's {{first appeal}} to royal {{authority}} in the dispute, which complained both that the lands in the Maryland charter were not really unsettled, as the charter claimed, and that the charter gave so much power to Calvert that it undermined {{the rights of the}} settlers, was rejected by the Lords of Foreign Plantations in July 1633. The following year, the main body of Calvert's settlers arrived in the Chesapeake and established a permanent settlement on Yaocomico lands at St. Mary's City. With the support of the Virginia establishment, Claiborne <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Calvert that his allegiance was to Virginia and royal authority, and not to the proprietary authority in Maryland. Some historical reports claim that Claiborne tried to incite the natives against the Maryland colonists by telling them that the settlers at St. Mary's were actually Spanish and enemies of the English, although this claim has never been proven. In 1635, a Maryland commissioner named Thomas Cornwallis swept the Chesapeake for illegal traders and captured one of Claiborne's pinnaces in the Pocomoke Sound. Claiborne tried to recover it by force, but was defeated; although he retained his settlement on Kent Island. These were the first naval battles in North American waters, on 23 April and 10 May 1635; three Virginians were killed.|$|E
