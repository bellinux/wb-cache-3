This sentiment was epitomized by Sliva's comment that [...] "Don't Starve will never, ever hold your hand, and I both love it and hate it for that." [...] For example, he felt some of his deaths were unfairly caused by the game's camera system obscuring needed objects. Meunier stated that [...] "survival doesn't come easy, but there's an undeniable thrill to the challenge," [...] but also placed the high difficulty in his list of the game's cons. Leon Hurley of Official PlayStation Magazine claimed that [...] "learning is half the fun and even the smallest victory <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> you’re winning with a capital FU."

She concluded: [...] "It was a lot of work but I was really really happy and I think it's something I'll be proud of 20 years from now."

You {{do something that}} you've never done, and it <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a bigger band." [...] The frontman also stated the mellower acoustic disc {{was an opportunity to}} use [...] "the acoustic tracks we wrote in the past eight or nine years, but never put on albums because they never seemed to fit", particularly because Grohl felt that [...] "it's hard to put an acoustic song {{in the middle of a}} rock record, because sometimes it mucks up the sequence." [...] The tracks include Grohl's first composition [...] "Friend of a Friend" [...] – done in 1990, and previously recorded under the pseudonym 'Late!' on the cassette Pocketwatch; [...] "Razor", which Grohl wrote for a benefit concert at the Wiltern Theatre; and drummer Taylor Hawkins' composition [...] "Cold Day in the Sun", which after an attempt to do an electric version became an unplugged track, featuring Hawkins on vocals and tambourine and Grohl in the drums.|$|E

[...] NME positioned it at number 48 on their list of the 50 best albums of year. They said, My Name Is My Name was the moment Clipse member Pusha T finally hit the home run he promised for so long. The beats snapped hard, the guests including Kendrick Lamar, Rick Ross and 2 Chainz glittered and the overall vibe was dirty but triumphant." [...] Paste ranked it number 34 on their list of the 50 best albums of 2013 saying, [...] "each bar has the ferociousness of a lion smelling the scent of fresh blood. Among his contemporaries, Pusha T is the sharp-witted wordsmith who <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> you’re listening to a master at work, devilishly cooking up something as pure and addictive as he possibly can." [...] It was named the third best hip hop album of 2013 by PopMatters. They commented saying, [...] "My Name Is My Name is easily one of the most impressive displays of lyricism of the year and contains some of 2013's best verses, as Pusha shows off his versatility..... The production is minimalistic and intelligently doesn't overshadow Pusha's performance. The beats are big and full of bass, giving life to the album and forming a unique theme, with a reunion with Pharrell triggering a nice blast of nostalgia..... My Name Is My Name has substance, style, and passion, and no doubt is an album that will still be appreciated a decade from now. [...] " [...] Consequence of Sound positioned it at number 44 on their list of the 50 best albums of the year.|$|E

One of the show's few negative reviews came in the Sunday Mercury, which stated: [...] "His whole tone is one of complete, smug condescension". Lee subsequently used this line to advertise his next stand-up tour. Lee frequently uses negative reviews on his posters in order to put off potential audience members who are unlikely to be fans of his comedy style.|$|E

2500|$|Essentially, the key {{components}} to Parker's pedal setup is a Holy Grail reverb into a Blues Driver into a Carbon Copy delay into a Dyna Comp into a Small Stone phaser into a Fuzz Face {{and then into}} a Diamond Vibrato (vibrato added during Lonerism-era). The reverb into a fuzz and phasers set to a slow rate are the hallmarks of Parker's guitar sound, which has influenced many modern psychedelic rock bands to have a similar setup, which Parker says [...] "it’s the most flattering {{thing in the world}} to hear a band ripping you off. I know some people get pissed off by it, but if I ever hear an artist and I can tell they’re using a phaser pedal the way I do, it’s a massive compliment. It <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> you’re making an impression, having an impact on people, which is really humbling, flattering".|$|E
2500|$|From the New York {{listening}} party Rolling Stone said [...] "'Million Dollar Bill' is a clattering, uptempo hip-hop-inspired number.

[...] MTVs Shaheem Reid comments revolved around the first track 'Million Dollar Bill', saying that [...] "Houston sings of looking for love and finding a man with potential. [...] "If he <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a million-dollar bill, say, 'Oh, oh/ Oh, oh,' [...] " [...] she sings on the hook. [...] "It's {{been a long time since}} love has come my way. I've been looking and searching for a man to touch this place." [...] Right from the start, 'Million Dollar Bill' displays her billion-dollar voice over a club-friendly Swizz track that even got Alicia Keys up and dancing while taking video with her personal camera as the words she wrote boomed through the speakers. Dean Piper of the Daily Mirror considered it a [...] "summer track" [...] reminiscent of Janet Jackson's [...] "The Best Things in Life Are Free." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nick Levine of Digital Spy said [...] "Written by Alicia Keys and {{produced}} by Swizz Beatz (probably {{best known for}} Beyoncé's 'Check On It' and 'Ring the Alarm'), it's a midtempo disco track with an unabashedly feelgood message. [...] "If he <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a million dollar bill," [...] Whitney sings on the chorus, 'Say oh-oh-oh, say oh-oh-oh'. The Voice is deeper and raspier than you might remember, but she's still capable of going for a money note. 'Million Dollar Bill' won't be storming any barns in a hurry, but it's a classy, dignified and thoroughly likeable comeback effort. Whitney, it's {{good to have you}} back." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com gave a mixed review saying, [...] "The good news on [...] "Million Dollar Bill" [...] is the performance is undeniably the Whitney Houston we all know. [...] The down side is it's all almost too familiar. The arrangement courtesy producer Swizz Beatz is very old school R [...] Alicia Keys has written a song that fits very well with her tradition of [...] "old soul" [...] songs, but Whitney Houston has failed to give it a new twist that would successfully make the old stunningly new again.". He also gave the song 3.5 stars out of five.|$|E

[...] Thomas improvised the song while performing with Willie Mitchell's band at a club in Covington, Tennessee, including a spoken word section that he regularly used as a shtick as a radio DJ: [...] "Oh I feel so unnecessary - {{this is the kind}} of stuff that <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> you wanna do something nasty, like waste some chicken gravy on your white shirt right down front."

All of a sudden, as you are just in motion, prepared for your first spring, a sharp cutting gush of air passes close to your face, and nearly blinds you; you feel that you can hardly breathe, but you hear a groan, and a stumble; your next neighbour and three men behind him have been sent into eternity by a cannon-ball from the enemy. Do you think then that the man who fired the cannon knows, or cares who he has killed? Well, on you go; had you not been in a crowd, the enemy's fire, maybe, might have frightened you; but good company makes men brave: on you go, and throw yourself into the trench. You find a more active man than yourself just above you; he is already nearly at the top of the bank, his feet are stuck in the sods above your head; he is about to spring upon the rampart, when the bayonet of a republican passes through his breast, and he falls at your feet, or perhaps upon your head. You feel your heart shudder, and your blood runs cold, but it is no time for pausing now; you could not return if you would, neither can you remain where you are: up you go, grasping your musket in one hand and digging the other into the loose sods.
