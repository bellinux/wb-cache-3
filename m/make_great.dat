5|$|After Áed's death, {{there is}} a two-decade gap until the death of DonaldII (Domnall mac Constantín) in 900 during which nothing is {{reported}} in the Irish annals. The entry for the reign between Áed and DonaldII is corrupt in the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba, {{and in this case}} the Chronicle is at variance with every other king list. According to the Chronicle, Áed was followed by Eochaid, a grandson of Kenneth MacAlpin, who is somehow connected with Giric, but all other lists say that Giric ruled after Áed and <b>make</b> <b>great</b> claims for him. Giric is not known to have been a kinsman of Kenneth's, although {{it has been suggested that}} he was related to him by marriage. The major changes in Pictland which began at about this time have been associated by Alex Woolf and Archie Duncan with Giric's reign.|$|E

25|$|Many {{mathematical}} domains <b>make</b> <b>great</b> use {{of prime}} numbers. An example from {{the theory of}} finite groups are the Sylow theorems: if G is a finite group and pn is the highest power of the prime p that divides the order of G, then G has a subgroup of order pn.

25|$|Forage fish often <b>make</b> <b>great</b> migrations {{between their}} spawning, feeding and nursery grounds. Schools of a {{particular}} stock usually travel in a triangle between these grounds. For example, one stock of herrings have their spawning ground in southern Norway, their feeding ground in Iceland, and their nursery ground in northern Norway. Wide triangular journeys such as these may be important because forage fish, when feeding, cannot distinguish their own offspring.|$|E

25|$|Babylonian {{mathematics}} (also {{known as}} Assyro-Babylonian mathematics) was any mathematics developed or {{practiced by the}} people of Mesopotamia, from the days of the early Sumerians to the fall of Babylon in 539 BC. Babylonian mathematical texts are plentiful and well edited. The Babylonians were able to <b>make</b> <b>great</b> advances in mathematics for two reasons. Firstly, the number 60 is a superior highly composite number, having factors of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60 (including those that are themselves composite), facilitating calculations with fractions. Additionally, unlike the Egyptians and Romans, the Babylonians had a true place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values (much as, in our base ten system, 734 = 7×100 + 3×10 + 4×1).|$|E
25|$|In 1862, concert guitarist Julián Arcas, on tour in Castellón, {{heard the}} young Tárrega play and advised Tárrega's father to allow Francisco {{to come to}} Barcelona to study with him. Tárrega's father agreed, but insisted that his son take piano lessons as well. The guitar was viewed as an {{instrument}} to accompany singers, while the piano was quite popular throughout Europe. However, Tárrega had to stop his lessons shortly after, when Arcas left for a concert tour abroad. Although Tárrega was only ten years old, he ran away and tried to start a musical career on his own by playing in coffee houses and restaurants in Barcelona. He was soon found and brought back to his father, who had to <b>make</b> <b>great</b> sacrifices to advance his son's musical education.|$|E

25|$|Bukowski's parents met in Andernach in Germany {{following}} World War I. The poet's {{father was}} German-American and a sergeant in the United States Army serving in Germany following Germany's defeat in 1918. He {{had an affair}} with Katharina, a German friend's sister, and she became pregnant. Charles Bukowski repeatedly claimed to be born out of wedlock, but Andernach marital records indicate that his parents married one month before his birth. Afterwards, Henry Bukowski became a building contractor, set to <b>make</b> <b>great</b> financial gains {{in the aftermath of the}} war, and after two years moved the family to Pfaffendorf. However, given the crippling reparations being required of Germany, which led to a stagnant economy and high levels of inflation, Henry Bukowski was unable to make a living, so he decided to move the family to the United States. On April 23, 1923, they sailed from Bremerhaven to Baltimore, Maryland, where they settled.|$|E
25|$|A {{spin-off}} {{series of}} audios, titled Dalek Empire (2001–08), is set after The Time of the Daleks and features a successful Dalek {{invasion of the}} Milky Way during an Earth Empire. The Daleks <b>make</b> <b>great</b> headway and manage to conquer their way up to Earth's solar system in a prolonged war against both humans and the Daleks of an alternate reality. They are finally defeated by a psychic attack that causes every piece of Dalek machinery to self-destruct in an ever-expanding wave which obliterates their forces and kills the Emperor. However, this also cripples civilisation of the Milky Way and sets galactic development back by a substantial amount. Centuries later, when only a handful remember the Daleks, the Dalek Empire attacks again {{under the command of}} a Dalek Supreme, which infects the borders of the galaxy with a virus that genetically re-engineers humans into Daleks. By {{the end of the third}} Dalek Empire series, the Daleks have a new giant army and are poised to go to war with the Galactic Federation, with the outcome uncertain.|$|E
25|$|In 1876 Grassi {{investigated}} {{his native}} hometown Rovellasca {{for the high}} mortality of cats and discovered that they were heavily infected with the nematode Dochmius balsami. In 1878, while still {{a student at the}} University of Pavia, he discovered anchylostomiasis in Italy from by identifying the eggs from the faeces of infected individuals. He continued to <b>make</b> <b>great</b> impacts on the study of Anguillula intestinalis, filarial worms, Trichocephalus dispar, and Bilharzia. He was the first to show that the human dwarf tapeworm Taenia nana is able to go through its entire life cycle in one animal, without the need of an intermediate host, a notion that had long been rejected. He was also the first to show that the flea Pulex serraticeps is the intermediate host of feline tapeworm Taenia elliptica. Thus he proposed that swallowing of infected fleas (for example, with milk) might be the reason for taeniasis in children. In 1879 he published a work on the life cycle of Strongyloides stercoralis, and erected the genus Strongyloides. In 1890 he, with Salvatore Calandruccio, described Dipetalonema reconditum, a non-pathogenic filarial worm of dogs, and showed that the parasite completed its development in human fleas, Pulex irritans.|$|E
40|$|Coping {{strategies}} {{are used to}} adapt to the changes that occur during aging. This study investigated 275 older adults who attended a senior citizen’s centre. They provided sociodemographic data and answered the Stress Coping Questionnaire (SCQ) in a semistructured interview. The aim was to analyse the use of coping strategies based in several sociodemographic variables, using correlations, t tests, and ANOVAs. The results showed a positive and significant association between age and religion, and differences were found in gender, marital status, educational attainment, and income level. In conclusion, as age increases, religion is most commonly used coping strategy; women <b>make</b> <b>greater</b> use of avoidance, seek social support, and use religion; singles mainly seek social support and positive reappraisal; widowers <b>make</b> <b>greater</b> use of religion; people with a lower level of education use more negative self-targeting and avoidance; people with higher incomes mainly use strategies centred on solving problems; and those with low incomes <b>make</b> <b>greater</b> use of religion...|$|R
