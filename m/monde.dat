5|$|In Vagrant Story, the Iocus priesthood of {{the kingdom}} of Valendia is shown to use the Kildean rood as a symbol, {{although}} they follow the teachings of a saint named Iocus instead of the original Kildean teachings of the Kiltia religion of Leá <b>Monde.</b> Müllenkamp, founder of the city of Leá <b>Monde</b> featured in the story, used to be a priestess of Kiltia, and bore the rood on her back. The followers of St. Iocus are outwardly intolerant of magic, seeing it as an abomination, and yet its higher members continue to use it behind the scenes. This hypocrisy is revealed {{over the course of the}} story, though it goes unresolved.|$|E

5|$|Vagrant Story (1999) is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game featuring no shops and no player interaction with other characters; instead, the game focuses on weapon creation and modification, {{as well as}} elements of puzzle-solving and strategy. The game {{takes place in the}} fictional kingdom of Valendia and the ruined city of Leá <b>Monde.</b> The story centers on Ashley Riot, an elite agent known as a Riskbreaker, who must travel to Leá <b>Monde</b> to investigate the link between a cult leader and a senior Valendian Parliament member, Duke Bardorba. In the prologue, Ashley is blamed for murdering the duke, and the game discloses the events that happen one week before the murder.|$|E
5|$|Vagrant Story {{is set in}} {{the ruins}} of the city of Leá <b>Monde.</b> The kingdom of Valendia is also heavily mentioned, and a few of its {{locations}} are featured in the prologue and the ending sequence.

5|$|Ashley is a Riskbreaker, {{a militant}} {{division}} of the VKP responsible for upholding state security and law. Although Callo accompanies him, Ashley does not accept her as a combat partner due to her lack of combat experience. Callo ends up being Sydney's hostage and discovers the truth of Müllenkamp's activities. Another Riskbreaker, Rosencrantz, appears during Ashley's battles in Leá <b>Monde,</b> briefing him on the plans of the VKP, Sydney and the Cardinal, and subsequently his take on Ashley's past. This casts suspicion on Ashley's behalf, as Riskbreakers always work alone.|$|E
5|$|From 1930 to 1970, the Jules Rimet Trophy {{was awarded}} to the World Cup winning team. It was {{originally}} simply known as the World Cup or Coupe du <b>Monde,</b> but in 1946 it was renamed after the FIFA president Jules Rimet who set up the first tournament. In 1970, Brazil's third victory in the tournament entitled them to keep the trophy permanently. However, the trophy was stolen in 1983 {{and has never been}} recovered, apparently melted down by the thieves.|$|E

5|$|The populations seen in Final Fantasy Tactics and Vagrant Story are {{essentially}} human. The other intelligent races who appear are hostile or monster-like, such as Goblins or Ogres. Friendly intelligent races appear in later games set in Ivalice, where {{the human race}} is called Humes. Monsters and the like are thought not to exist by the general populace in Vagrant Story, with the monsters in the isolated Leá <b>Monde</b> all stemming from the Dark. The races are sorted by appearance and then according to the alphabetical order.|$|E
5|$|Vagrant Story is a solo action {{role-playing}} game, {{in which}} the player controls Ashley Riot from a third-person perspective while exploring Leá <b>Monde</b> and the catacombs underneath. The player may also switch into first-person perspective {{to allow for a}} 360° view using the START button or right analog stick on the game controller. Characters and sprites are proportionate with each other, and the player navigates Ashley on a three-dimensional field map. Navigation is in real-time, and areas accessed by the player are stored in an in-game map menu.|$|E
5|$|After {{the liberation}} of Belgium in September 1944, there was a boom of new {{magazines}} for the youth, both in French and Dutch. Many of those tried to mix American comics with local artists. Vandersteen worked in these early years for countless publications. He continued publishing in Bravo, with the medieval gags of Lancelot. Having moved to the suburbs of Brussels to avoid the bombardments of Antwerp, he {{came into contact with}} some French language editors. French language magazines he contributed to included Franc Jeu, Perce-Neige, and Le Petit <b>Monde.</b> Two of the comics he created for Franc Jeu were also published in albums. By 1947, all these magazines had disappeared.|$|E
