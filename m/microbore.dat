40|$|Research status at project start: In the past, the {{production}} of fine structures in organic materials using Excimer Lasers always involved mask procedures with their characteristic drawbacks, i. e., laser power loss and invariance of structures. Alternative methods such as multiple reflection on the mask or plasma etching could not be implemented with the necessary efficiency and/or they posed technical problems. For the multi-beam technology investigated here, the following components {{failed to meet the}} state-of-the-art requirements: microlens arrays, homogenizer for excimer laser, CCD sensor system for multi-beam observation and two-axis tilting mirror. Reason for/objective of investigation: An increasing demand exists in the PCB industry for high-production laserdrillsystems for {{the production}} of microvials in circuit boards. The goal was to establish the fundamental principles for a machine operating simultaneously with a very high number of individually positionable beams. Method: The fundamental techniques and components required for the multi-beam laser drill were investigated, developed and tested on the basis of laboratory samples. Subsequently, a gradually constructed breadboard was used to test the interaction between the individual procedures and components. Finally, the breadboard was used, in cooperation with project partners, to produce boreholes with diameter 50 #mu#m in polyamide, polyester and simular organic materials. Results: As expected, the multi-beam procedure under investigation is suitable for producing a large number of <b>microbores</b> simultaneously and flexibly with regard to their position. All required components could be implemented as planned. For the construction of an economical multi-beam machine, individual components, particularly the projection lens and the tilting mirror, still have to be optimized. (orig.)

Miniaturized separation systems are an attractive option for the separation {{of a wide range of}} analytes. Smaller columns result in reduced consumption of stationary phase, solvents, and samples. This is particularly important in the case of chiral separations since chiral selectors and chiral analytes tend to be expensive. In this research, two miniaturized separation systems were established, namely, <b>microbore</b> and capillary separations which contain stereoselective antibodies as chiral selectors. <b>Microbore</b> columns were used for separations of amino acid enantiomers with both UV and mass spectrometric detection. The temperature of <b>microbore</b> columns could be controlled using a homemade water jacket connected to a thermostated waterbath. An additional study confirmed that aqueous buffers at physiological pH were suitable mobile phases; specifically, phosphate buffers were ideal for UV detection and ammonium bicarbonate buffer was ideal for mass spectrometric detection. Use of mass spectrometric detection was particularly advantageous since it enabled the simultaneous separation of multiple amino acid enantiomer pairs. Capillary columns containing stereoselective antibodies were also developed; several parameters were investigated to optimize preparation of capillary columns. For both <b>microbore</b> and capillary columns, separations improved on longer columns and at lower temperatures.

40|$|Abstract | Aromatic amines and azaarenes are {{successfully}} separated on both analytical {{scale and}} <b>microbore</b> packed columns via supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC). Because <b>microbore</b> columns {{can be used}} with commercial instruments that have density and pressure programming capability, higher sensitivity and resolution are obtained. Separation is compared with both reversed-phase and normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The SFC separation has a much higher degree of resolution, and method development is easier than with HPLC modes. Flame-ionization (FID), ultraviolet (UV), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) on-line detectors are used for detection and identification. A comparison of restrictors indicates that an optimized separation also requires an optimized restrictor size because different restrictor sizes have different linear velocities. A retention mechanism study for these nitrogen-containing compounds with SFC shows that the elution order not only depends on basicity and steric hindrance, but also on the solubility of the solute in C O 2.

The MCN, with its ability to nebulize liquids at low flow rates, was adapted to a small bore (2 mm id) <b>microbore</b> anion-exchange column. After optimizing the parameters of the MCN by factorial experimental design, an evaluation of the separation of redox As and Se species was carried out. The method was applied to the determination of the four species in a sample recommended for Se speciation studies, in a spiked natural water and in polluted soil leachings. No interference of 40 Ar 35 CI on 75 As was observed when natural water samples were analyzed. The method showed good accuracy and repeatability in addition to facile handling and development. A detection limit of 1 ng ml- 1 was found for the arsenic species and 4 ng ml- 1 for the selenium species...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTryptic digests were {{analyzed}} by means of online <b>microbore</b> liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (LC/MS) for some common proteins. Following conventional enzymatic digestion with trypsin, the freeze-dried residues were dissolved in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) eluent and subjected to gradient reversed-phase <b>microbore</b> HPLC separation with mass spectrometric detection. The latter {{was done in the}} full-scan single or tandem (MS/MS) mass spectrometry mode. The formation of gas-phase ions from dissolved analytes was accomplished at atmospheric pressure by pneumatically assisted electrospray (ion spray) ionization. This produced field-assisted ion evaporation of dissolved ions, which could then be mass-analyzed for molecular mass or structure. In the full-scan LC/MS mode, the masses for the peptide fragments in the tryptic digests can be determined as either their singly or multiply charged ions. When the molecular weights of the peptides lie outside the mass range of the mass spectrometer, the multiply charged feature of these experimental conditions still provides reliable molecular weight determinations. In addition, collision-activated dissociation (CAD) on selected peptide precursor ions provides online LC/MS/MS sequence information for the tryptic fragments. Results are shown for the tryptic digests of horse heart cytochrome c, bovine β-lactoglobulin A, and bovine β-lactoglobulin B...|$|E
40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{determination of}} the monoamines dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NA) and serotonin (5 -HT) in in vivo microdialysis samples remains challenging because of the low extracellular neurotransmitter levels in different brain regions, specific sample characteristics, {{and the quest for}} high temporal resolution and a multi-target strategy in neuropharmacological research. A fast and sensitive <b>microbore</b> (1. 0  mm i. d. column) UHPLC method coupled to electrochemical detection (ECD) is developed by means of design of experiments with the emphasis on sufficient retention of NA within an acceptable total analysis time. Indeed, NA is the earliest eluting compound and often interferes with the broad solvent front originating from the sample matrix. The sensitive UHPLC-ECD assay (LLOQ of 100  pM for NA and 150  pM for DA and 5 -HT) with an analysis time of 8  min for standard solutions and 20  min for in vivo microdialysis samples originating from rat hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and striatum, is validated applying accuracy profiles. The combination of in vivo microdialysis and <b>microbore</b> UHPLC-ECD has shown to be particularly suitable for future contributions to neuropharmacological research on the monoaminergic system.

40|$|Fast {{resolutions of}} racemic {{compounds}} (sulfoxides, amino alcohols, and α-methylarylacetic acids derivatives) were achieved on a chiral <b>microbore</b> column using {{carbon dioxide and}} a polar methanol/dioxane modifier. The stationary phase {{used in this study}} contains the 3, 5 -dinitrobenzoyl derivative of R,R(−) - 1, 2 -diaminocyclohexane (DACH-DNB) as the chiral moiety, anchored to a silica gel surface by covalent bonds. Both thermodynamic and kinetic separation performances were improved by using a super- or subcritical carbon dioxide mobile phase (SFC, SubFC) ...|$|E
