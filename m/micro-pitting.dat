40|$|AbstractIn this study, we {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} supplied oil quantity and contact bulk temperature on <b>micro-pitting</b> life using two-roller contact machine. To quantify the failure rate of damaged surfaces of <b>micro-pitting</b> occurrence, the DBR(Dark and Bright Ratio) method was effectively implemented for observing not a sudden occurrence of macro-pitting but the transition of <b>micro-pitting</b> growth. The failure criterion is set as 4 % <b>micro-pitting</b> on contact surfaces, which is adopted from precedent researches. The change of surface damaged area was measured by an optical microscope and calculated {{by the use of}} dark and bright ratio of test specimen pictures taken by optical microscope. The optimum oil quantity was determined to obtain the minimum oil quantity with no change in bulk temperature despite of increasing the supplied oil quantity.

40|$|In this {{research}} study, the <b>micro-pitting</b> related contact failures of wind turbine gearbox components were investigated both experimentally and theoretically. On the experimental side, a twin-disk type test machine {{was used to}} simulate wind turbine transmission contacts {{in terms of their}} kinematic (rolling and sliding speeds), surface roughnesses, material parameters and lubricant conditions. A test matrix that represents the ranges of contact conditions of the wind turbine gear boxes was defined and executed to bring an empirical understanding to the <b>micro-pitting</b> problem in terms of key contact parameters and operating conditions. On the theoretical side, the first deterministic <b>micro-pitting</b> model based on a mixed elastohydrodynamic lubrication formulations and multi-axial near-surface crack initiation model was developed.

Field measured time series of SCADA signals, including wind speed, generator power and rotational speed, were used to obtain the statistical variation of gear shaft torque and rotational speed. From the SCADA data obtained over a 2. 2 year period random number datasets of smaller sizes were selected. Based on these random number datasets the effect of gear shaft torque and rotational speed variations on the probabilistic risk of gear <b>micro-pitting</b> was investigated. Determinations of the gear tooth flank contact stress and lubricant film thickness were based on the technical report of gear <b>micro-pitting,</b> ISO/TR 15144 - 1 (2010).
