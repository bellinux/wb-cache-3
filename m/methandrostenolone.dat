50|$|The {{father of}} {{anabolic}} steroids in the United States was John Ziegler (1917-1983), a physician for the U.S. weightlifting {{team in the}} mid-20th century. In 1954, on his tour to Vienna with his team for the world championship, Ziegler learned from his Russian colleague that the Soviet weightlifting team's success was due to their use of testosterone as a performance-enhancing drug. Deciding that U.S. athletes needed chemical assistance to remain competitive, Ziegler worked with the CIBA Pharmaceutical Company to develop an oral anabolic steroid. This resulted {{in the creation of}} <b>methandrostenolone,</b> which appeared on the market in 1960. During the Olympics that year, the Danish cyclist Knud Enemark Jensen collapsed and died while competing in the 100-kilometer (62-mile) race.

40|$|Anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) {{abuse is}} {{associated}} with multiple neurobehavioral disturbances. The sites of action and the neurobiological sequels of AAS abuse are unclear at present. We investigated whether two different AASs, nandrolone and <b>methandrostenolone,</b> could affect neuronal survival in culture. The endogenous androgenic steroid testosterone was used for comparison. Both testosterone and nandrolone were neurotoxic at micromolar concentrations, and their effects were prevented by blockade of androgen receptors (ARs) with flutamide. Neuronal toxicity developed only over a 48 -hr exposure to the steroids. The cell-impermeable analogues testosterone-BSA and nandrolone-BSA, which preferentially target membrane-associated ARs, were also neurotoxic in a time-dependent and flutamide-sensitive manner. Testosterone-BSA and nandrolone-BSA were more potent than their parent compounds, suggesting that membrane-associated ARs were the relevant sites for the neurotoxic actions of the steroids. Unlike testosterone and nandrolone, toxicity by <b>methandrostenolone</b> and methandrostenolone-BSA was insensitive to flutamide, but it was prevented by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist RU- 486. Methandrostenolone-BSA was more potent than the parent compound, suggesting that its toxicity relied on the preferential activation of putative membrane-associated GRs. Consistently with the evidence that membrane-associated GRs can mediate rapid effects, a brief challenge with methandrostenolone-BSA was able to promote neuronal toxicity. Activation of putative membrane steroid receptors by nontoxic (nanomolar) concentrations of either nandrolone-BSA or methandrostenolone-BSA became sufficient to increase neuronal susceptibility to the apoptotic stimulus provided by β-amyloid (the main culprit of AD).

The AAS was injected six times with 1 week's interval and the rats were sacrificed 2 {{days after the}} final injection. 5 -HT and its metabolite 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5 -HIAA), DA and its metabolites 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were measured. The effect on DA and 5 -HT synthesis rate was analysed as the accumulation of 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenyl-alanine (DOPA) and 5 -hydroxytryptophan (5 -HTP), respectively, after inhibition of the amino acid decarboxylase with NSD- 1015 (3 -hydroxy-benzylhydrazine dihydrochloride). Additionally, the monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity was analysed in the hypothalamus. The DOPAC+HVA/DA ratio was increased in the striatum in all treatment groups. However, the synthesis rate of DA was significantly increased only in the <b>methandrostenolone</b> treated group. The 5 -HIAA/ 5 -HT ratio was increased in all treatment groups in the hippocampus, in the frontal cortex in the methandrostenolone-treated animals and in the hypothalamus in the testosterone- and oxymetholone-treated rats, while the 5 -HT synthesis rate was not affected by the AAS-treatments. The MAO-A activity was increased in the oxymetholone-treated rats while the other treatment groups were unaffected. The MAO-B activity was not changed. The results indicate that relatively high doses of AAS increase dopaminergic and 5 -hydroxytryptaminergic metabolism in male rat brain, probably due to enhanced turnover in these monaminergic systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Over {{the last}} few years the use of {{anabolic}} steroids has become increasingly common amongst amateur athletes and for aesthetic purposes. As a result, the adverse events related to their use are being seen more frequently. <b>Methandrostenolone</b> is an anabolic steroid which is widely available and has been used for both performance enhancement and aesthetic purposes. This drug has also been reported to cause cholestasis of the intra-hepatic bile ducts resulting in elevated aminotransferases, hyperbilirubinemia and clinical jaundice. However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge this agent has not been previously reported to cause pancreatitis or acute kidney injury. Case presentation In this paper, we report the case of a 50 -year-old man of Indian descent who presented with a six week history of diffuse abdominal pain, anorexia and weight loss following an eight week cycle of <b>methandrostenolone</b> use. At initial presentation, his lipase level was 785 U/L, bilirubin was 922 μmol/L and creatinine was 200 U/L while his aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were only mildly elevated at 61 U/L and 56 U/L respectively. His lipase peaked on day nine at > 3000 U/L whilst his creatinine level was 299 U/L. Imaging was consistent with acute pancreatitis while a liver biopsy was consistent with intra-hepatic cholestasis and a kidney biopsy revealed evidence of acute tubular necrosis. Conclusion Both acute pancreatitis and acute kidney injury have rarely been reported with anabolic steroid use and they have not been previously reported to occur in the same patient. This case demonstrates some potentially new and serious adverse consequences occurring with the use of anabolic steroids, of which physicians need to be aware. </p...|$|E

40|$|EXPERIMENTAL {{production}} of malignant tumours by nickel {{and its compounds}} has been previously reported in different animal species (Hueper, 1952, 1955, 1958). It was recently demonstrated that a single instramuscular injection of nickel sulphide is capable of producing {{a high incidence of}} rhabdomyosarcomas in rats (Gilman, 1962). The carcinogenicity of this metallic salt seems rather selective for striated muscles, but not specific. Malignant muscle tumours have also been observed in animals injected with cobalt and chromium compounds (Gilman and Ruckerbauer, 1962; Heath, 1956, 1960; Hueper and Payne, 1959). That rhabdomyosarcoma can be induced in laboratory animals is of paramount interest, because of its high malignancy and ability to produce extensive metastases, a finding uncommon in experimental carcinogenesis with chemical agents. Animal studies also provide some additional criteria for diagnosis of this undifferentiated tumour in man.

40|$|Anabolic steroids are {{structurally}} similar compounds, {{and their}} product-ion spectra obtained by tandem mass spectrometry under electrospray ionization conditions are quite {{difficult to interpret}} because of poly-ring structures and lack of a charge-retaining center in their chemical structures. In the present study, the fragmentation of nine anabolic steroids {{of interest to the}} racing industry was investigated by using triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer, and a linear ion trap instrument. With the aid of an expert system software (Mass Frontier version 3. 0), accurate mass measurements, and multiple stage tandem mass spectrometric (MSn) experiments, fragmentation pathways were elucidated for boldenone, <b>methandrostenolone,</b> tetrahydrogestrinone (THG), trenbolone, normethandrolone and mibolerone. Small differences in the chemical structures of the steroids, such as an additional double-bond or a methyl group, result in significantly different fragmentation pathways. The fragmentation pathways proposed in this paper allow interpretation of major product ions of other anabolic steroids reported by other researchers in a recent publication [19].

Then, the possibilities of multistep stacking to improve the sensitivity for these analytes were investigated. SEFs obtained by double stacking preconcentration ranged from 138 to 185, enabling concentration LODs of 2. 79610 – 7 mol/L (for methyltestosterone), 3. 47610 – 7 mol/L (for testosterone) and 3. 56610 – 7 mol/L (for <b>methandrostenolone).</b> Although online triple stacking preconcentration was achieved, its repeatability was very poor and SEFs for the studied analytes were not calculated.
