In addition, asymmetric distribution of mass loading (e. g. bacteria) will cause the shift of “blind point” and change of <b>mass</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of an MSP based biosensor. In this work, a modal analysis method was introduced and conducted to derive the governing vibration equation for an MSP biosensor with asymmetric mass loading. The effects of asymmetric mass loading on the “blind point” shift and <b>mass</b> <b>sensitivity</b> were unveiled by solving the governing vibration equation. It {{was found that the}} plot of “blind point” shift showed an “M” shape with the valley located at a/l ∼ 0. 5 and two peaks located at a/l ∼ 0. 25 and a/l ∼ 0. 75. In addition, the theoretical results showed that the resonance frequency shift (Δf) depends on the value of a/l (i. e. both the attached mass and mass distribution) and their relationship is nonlinear. Based on the definition of <b>mass</b> <b>sensitivity</b> (Sm), the values of Sm were derived for the selected values of a/l.

We assess different aspects {{that contribute to the}} uncertainty in the prediction of the contribution of GIC to future sea-level rise, such as (1) the volume-area scaling method (scaling constant), (2) the choice of glacier inventory, (3) the imbalance of glaciers with climate, (4) the <b>mass</b> balance <b>sensitivity,</b> and (5) the climate models. Additionally, a comparison of the model 10 results to the 20 th century GIC contribution is presented. We find that small variations in the scaling constant cause significant variations in the initial volume of the glaciers, but only limited variations in the glacier volume change. If two existing glacier inventories are tuned such that the initial volume is the same, the GIC sea-level contribution over 100 yr differs by 0. 027 m. It appears that the <b>mass</b> 15 balance <b>sensitivity</b> is also important: variations of 20 % in the <b>mass</b> balance <b>sensitivity</b> have an impact of 17 % on the resulting sea-level projections. Another important factor is the choice of the climate model, as the GIC contribution to sea-level change largely depends on the temperature and precipitation taken from climate models. Combining all the uncertainties examined in this study leads to a total uncertainty of 4. 5 cm or 30 % 20 in the GIC contribution to global mean sea level. Reducing the variance in the climate models and improving the glacier inventories will significantly reduce the uncertainty in calculating the GIC contributions, and are therefore crucial actions to improve future sea-level projections...|$|R
