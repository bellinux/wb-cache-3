5|$|Although rarely {{performed}} today, at the time, Fatinitza was {{an international}} success. The composer, lyricists, and theatre would reunite for two <b>more</b> <b>international</b> successes in their next two productions: Boccaccio (1879), Suppé's best-known and most popular operetta; and another cross-dressing army opera in Donna Juanita (1880). However, after these successes, Suppé's later operettas proved less popular with audiences, and, {{according to the}} musicologist Andrew Lamb, were also of lower quality.|$|E
5|$|During a {{friendly}} game against Australia on July 21, 2004, Hamm scored her 151st international goal setting {{the record for}} most international goals scored by any player in the world, male or female. She held the world record until Abby Wambach scored her 159th goal on June 20, 2013. The Australia match also marked Hamm's 259th international appearance; only two of her teammates, Kristine Lilly and Christie Rampone, have played in <b>more</b> <b>international</b> games.|$|E

Hecht credits Kevin Kay and his editorial collaboration with the UFC for highlighting the show's story lines, which he believes helped drive its ratings success.|$|E
5|$|Josef Müller {{took over}} as CEO in 1950. A {{decision}} was taken to undertake <b>more</b> <b>international</b> projects, following a period of essentially domestic work after World War II. This included a series of power infrastructure works in Turkey and bridge and smelting works construction in Egypt during the early 1950s. It {{is interesting to note}} that many projects from this period were undertaken outside of the First World;many were funded from development aid budgets.|$|E

5|$|After {{their work}} with Black Uhuru and that group's line-up change, Sly and Robbie pursued <b>more</b> <b>international</b> music endeavors. They {{branched}} out into cross-genre experiments with a conceptual, ensemble-oriented approach, while developing a mentorship with record producer Bill Laswell, whom they met through Blackwell and by working on Mick Jagger's 1985 album She's the Boss. In 1985, they collaborated with Laswell on their album Language Barrier, which had guest contributions from Herbie Hancock, Bob Dylan, Afrika Bambaataa, and Manu DiBango. Its recording developed from a track the duo had revisited from their work on the soundtrack to the 1983 film Never Say Never Again. The track had been done with electronic drums at Compass Point Studios, but scrapped as a rhythm track for later use.|$|E

To accommodate the projected growth and aid with landing new nonstop flights, the Metro Nashville Airport Authority has announced a $1.2 billion renovation of the airport dubbed as BNA Vision. It is expected to be completed by 2023.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, {{the first}} statewide {{competition}} was held, and {{just over two}} years later, the newly formed United States Academic Decathlon Association held the first national competition in April 1982 at Loyola Marymount University in California—200 high schools from 16 states and the District of Columbia competed {{for the chance to}} attend. Peterson, inspired by the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, hoped to make Academic Decathlon an international event. At the 1984 Nationals, 32 states as well as Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and South Korea fielded teams. The inclusion of foreign countries did not become a regular occurrence, however. There was no <b>more</b> <b>international</b> participation until 1989, when teams from Northern Ireland and Rio de Janeiro competed. Since then, only a handful of international schools have competed.|$|E

It is the world's most-visited city as measured by international arrivals and has the world's largest city airport system measured by passenger traffic. London is the world's leading investment destination, hosting <b>more</b> <b>international</b> retailers and ultra high-net-worth individuals than any other city. London's universities form the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe. In 2012, London became the first city to have hosted the modern Summer Olympic Games three times.|$|E

5|$|Murray {{pulled out}} of the match against Lithuania, so younger players could gain <b>more</b> <b>international</b> experience, and to allow him to focus on trying to win Grand Slam titles. His absence was criticised by Davis Cup captain John Lloyd. The Lithuanian side entered the tie as underdogs; fielding a team of teenagers, but Lithuania won 3–2. This {{was the first time that}} Great Britain had lost five ties in a row and was {{described}} as a humiliating Davis Cup defeat for Great Britain. It led to the resignation of John Lloyd as Davis Cup captain, with Britain now threatened with relegation to the lowest tier of the competition.|$|E
5|$|Terminal 3 {{opened on}} June 27, 2012. The project was {{announced}} in January 2001 {{as a way to}} accommodate rapid growth in passenger traffic, including international traffic. It came into question amid the 2008 recession and decreased tourism to Las Vegas, but the county decided to proceed with the project, anticipating eventual economic recovery and a rebound in passenger numbers. Terminal 3 cost $2.4 billion to build {{and is one of the}} largest public works projects in Nevada. It replaced Terminal 2, providing <b>more</b> <b>international</b> gates and a larger U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility. With its seven domestic gates, the terminal also eases congestion at Terminal 1.|$|E

TSO director MacMillan viewed this first-ever US invitation as a golden opportunity to garner <b>more</b> <b>international</b> invitations for the orchestra.

5|$|Adam's main rival was William Chambers (1723–96), another Scot, but born in Sweden. He {{did most}} of his work in London, with {{a small number of}} houses in Scotland. He was {{appointed}} architectural tutor to the Prince of Wales, later George III, and in 1766, with Robert Adam, as Architect to the King. <b>More</b> <b>international</b> in outlook than Adam, he combined Neo-classicism and Palladian conventions and his influence was mediated through his large number of pupils. The classical influence also reached church architecture. Scots-born architect James Gibbs (1682–1754) introduced a consciously antique style in his rebuilding of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, with a massive, steepled portico and rectangular, side-aisled plan. Similar patterns in Scotland can be seen at St Andrew's in the Square, Glasgow (1737–59), designed by Allan Dreghorn (1706–64) and built by the master mason Mungo Nasmyth. Gibbs' own design for St. Nicholas West, Aberdeen (1752–55), had the same rectangular plan, with a nave-and-aisles, barrel-vaulted layout with superimposed pedimented front.|$|E
5|$|Freedom of {{the press}} also {{opened the door for}} the first honest look at Czechoslovakia’s past by Czechoslovakia’s people. Many of the {{investigations}} centered on the country’s history under communism, especially in the instance of the Joseph Stalin-period. In another television appearance, Goldstucker presented both doctored and undoctored photographs of former communist leaders who had been purged, imprisoned, or executed and thus erased from communist history. The Writer’s Union also formed a committee in April 1968, headed by the poet Jaroslav Seifert, to investigate the persecution of writers after the Communist takeover in February 1948 and rehabilitate the literary figures into the Union, bookstores and libraries, and the literary world. Discussions on the current state of communism and abstract ideas such as freedom and identity were also becoming more common; soon, non-party publications began appearing, such as the trade union daily Prace (Labour). This was also helped by the Journalists Union, which by March 1968 had already convinced the Central Publication Board, the government censor, to allow editors to receive uncensored subscriptions for foreign papers, allowing for a <b>more</b> <b>international</b> dialogue around the news.|$|E

There was no <b>more</b> <b>international</b> participation until 1989, when teams from Northern Ireland and Rio de Janeiro competed. Since then, {{no more than a few}} teams a year have competed at Nationals. Since the first national event in 1982, only three states have ever won the National Competition: California, Texas, and Wisconsin, with California having won the majority of the National Competitions. El Camino Real High School from California currently holds the record for the most wins, having won its sixth national title in 2010.
