5|$|The Uruguay Round of GATT <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>negotiations</b> {{took place}} from 1986 to 1994, with 123 nations {{becoming}} party to agreements achieved throughout the negotiations. Among the achievements were trade liberalization in agricultural goods and textiles, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, and agreements on {{intellectual property rights}} issues. The key manifestation of this round was the Marrakech Agreement signed in April 1994, which established the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO is a chartered multilateral trade organization, charged with continuing the GATT mandate to promote trade, govern trade relations, and prevent damaging trade practices or policies. It became operational in January 1995. Compared with its GATT secretariat predecessor, the WTO features an improved mechanism for settling trade disputes since the organization is membership-based and not dependent on consensus as in traditional trade negotiations. This function was designed to address prior weaknesses, whereby parties in dispute would invoke delays, obstruct negotiations, or fall back on weak enforcement. In 1997, WTO members reached an agreement which committed to softer restrictions on commercial financial services, including banking services, securities trading, and insurance services. These commitments entered into force in March 1999, consisting of 70 governments accounting for approximately 95% of worldwide financial services.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, 23 {{countries}} {{concluded the}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at a UN conference in Geneva. Delegates intended {{the agreement to}} suffice while member states would negotiate creation of a UN body {{to be known as}} the International Trade Organization (ITO). As the ITO never became ratified, GATT became the de facto framework for later <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>negotiations.</b> Members emphasized trade reprocity as an approach to lowering barriers in pursuit of mutual gains. The agreement's structure enabled its signatories to codify and enforce regulations for trading of goods and services. GATT was centered on two precepts: trade relations needed to be equitable and nondiscriminatory, and subsidizing non-agricultural exports needed to be prohibited. As such, the agreement's most favored nation clause prohibited members from offering preferential tariff rates to any nation that it would not otherwise offer to fellow GATT members. In the event of any discovery of non-agricultural subsidies, members were authorized to offset such policies by enacting countervailing tariffs. The agreement provided governments with a transparent structure for managing trade relations and avoiding protectionist pressures. However, GATT's principles did not extend to financial activity, consistent with the era's rigid discouragement of capital movements. The agreement's initial round achieved only limited success in reducing tariffs. While the U.S. reduced its tariffs by one third, other signatories offered much smaller trade concessions.|$|E

However, they were decreasingly prepared to guarantee these measures multilaterally, {{that is to}} "bind" them. This paper analyzes the background of this development by resorting to three political economy arguments pro multilateral binding: the terms of trade externality argument, the "tying hand" argument, that is to protect a government which is prone to liberalize against domestic lobby groups, and finally the argument that trade policies are instruments for general political targets. For all three arguments, it is shown why an important driving force of mercantilistically motivated <b>trade</b> <b>negotiations</b> has become weaker, the reciprocity requirement.

Following a conceptual discussion of the political economy of regional as opposed to multilateral negotiations, I analyse existing data on trade and investment flows with a view to gaining some insight into the likely interest group preferences influencing the choice between alternative institutional arrangements to liberalize trade in services. Both the data and a comparison of the content of the major existing agreements suggest that service industries are more likely to see regional and multilateral liberalization as complements than substitutes. <b>Multilateral</b> Negotiations; Regional <b>Trade</b> Agreements; Trade in Services...|$|R
30|$|The {{international}} financial crisis has had multiple negative impacts on economic globalization, {{such as the}} deceleration of trade growth, a stronger tendency toward protectionism, strengthened fiscal regulation, and slower international capital flows. Developing countries are taking a more prudent attitude toward the liberalization of financial markets, and difficulties are growing in <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>negotiation</b> (the Doha Round of trade talk, for example). Therefore, the process of economic globalization will face periodic adjustment due to the {{international financial}} crisis (Lu 2010). In the future, with the restrictive power of the WTO’s <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> system, its rules and dispute resolution system will still be in effect.

40|$|International negotiators {{have faced}} {{repeated}} stalemates {{in a number}} of significant areas. Justice issues {{are at the heart of}} the matter in many cases, as vividly illustrated by <b>trade</b> <b>negotiations,</b> particularly at the multilateral level. Yet, issues of justice have received limited attention in research on <b>trade</b> <b>negotiation.</b> This article asks: do trade negotiators who take justice principles into account arrive at more effective agreements? Specifically, it explores relationships between two types of justice during the negotiation process — procedural and distributive justice — and the effectiveness of outcomes (agreements) in 22 cases of bilateral and <b>multilateral</b> international <b>trade</b> <b>negotiation.</b> It evaluates the impacts of these types of justice on negotiation effectiveness. The results from analyses clearly demonstrate that procedural justice plays a central role in contributing to effective outcomes in both bilateral and <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> cases. The correlations between procedural justice and effectiveness are very strong, and significantly stronger than between distributive justice and effectiveness. Moreover, distributive justice impacts upon effectiveness only when procedural justice principles are observed. These findings contribute knowledge about factors that enhance effective outcomes in international negotiations. They extend earlier work on justice in peace agreements and fill a gap in the research literature. They also provide advice for negotiators, and add important questions to the future research agenda. 29 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Preferential trading {{arrangements}} (PTAs) {{have spread}} widely {{over the past}} fifty years. During the same era, multilateral openness has grown to unprecedented heights, spurred by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and its successor, the World Trade Organization (WTO). If {{the cornerstone of the}} manifestly successful multilateral regime is nondiscrimination, why have its members increasingly resorted to preferential liberalization? We argue that developments at the heart of GATT WTO encourage its members to form PTAs as devices to obtain bargaining leverage within the multilateral regime. Specifically, the growth in GATT WTO membership, the periodic <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>negotiation</b> rounds, as well as participation and, especially, losses in formal GATT WTO disputes, have led its members to seek entrance into PTAs. Conducting the first statistical tests on the subject, we find strong evidence in support of this argument.

40|$|Treatment of unfair trade laws {{has become}} an {{important}} topic in <b>negotiations</b> on preferential <b>trading</b> areas. Recent preferential trading areas involving the United States, {{one of the most}} significant users of these laws, have established special binational dispute settlement panels to arbitrate disagreements. Using a panel database of U. S. antidumping and countervailing duty activity from 1980 through 2000, the article examines whether the use of dispute settlement panels has reduced such activity between the United States and its North American Free Trade Agreement partners. The analysis finds little evidence for any effect, calling into question the effectiveness of dispute settlement panels in reducing unfair trade law activity. With the success of <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>negotiation</b> rounds under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) in reducing traditional forms of trade protection, such as tariffs and quotas, attention has turned to the use of antidumping and countervailing duty laws by WTO member countries. In some countries, these laws have been on the books since well before the GATT/WTO existed. However, as GATT/WTO membership has grown over the past two decades, such activity has exploded. 1 This trend is worrisome for its implications for the ultimate effectiveness of recent and future GATT/WTO rounds. It may be that countries with antidumping and countervailing duty laws are willing to negotiate greater reductions in other forms of trade protection, since such laws allow the most import-sensitive sectors a channel of relief when negotiated reductions in trade barriers take place. But it is also the case that increased antidumping and countervailing duty activity may seriously undermine free trade agreements that do not fully addres...|$|R
