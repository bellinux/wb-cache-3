5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, <b>my</b> <b>dear</b> <b>friend,</b> determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E
25|$|<b>My</b> <b>dear</b> <b>friend,</b> {{what is this}} our life? A {{boat that}} swims in the sea, and all one knows for certain {{about it is that}} one day it will capsize. Here we are, two good old boats that have been {{faithful}} neighbors, and above all your hand has done its best to keep me from 'capsizing'! Let us then continue our voyage -- each for the other's sake, for a long time yet, a long time! We should miss each other so much! Tolerably calm seas and good winds and above all sun -- what I wish for myself, I wish for you, too, and am sorry that my gratitude can find expression only in such a wish and has no influence at all on wind or weather.|$|E
500|$|On {{his return}} to England, Heber {{prepared}} for Holy Orders at Oxford, where he found time for literary pursuits, was active in university politics and led a busy social life. He was ordained as deacon {{at the end of}} February 1807 and received full priest's orders from the Bishop of Oxford on 24 May 1807. He was then inducted into the family living, as rector of Hodnet; he was later to describe his role as [...] "a half-way station between a parson and a squire". At first he divided his time between his parish and Oxford, where he continued working for his M.A. degree and fulfilled duties at All Souls. He had not at this time determined his own doctrinal position; writing to Thornton he admitted that he was still searching: [...] "Pray for me, <b>my</b> <b>dear</b> <b>friend,</b> that I may have my eyes open to the truth ... and if it please God that I persevere in his ministry I may undertake the charge with a quiet mind and a good conscience". A High churchman by upbringing, Heber was a strong opponent of factional rivalry; he eventually found a place around the midpoint of the Anglican spectrum between the High Church and evangelical wings, with perhaps a slight inclination towards the evangelicals.|$|E

2500|$|In the novels, Hastings's {{literary}} function changes with Poirot's method.

He did not receive permission but still visited the grave. Houdini believed that he had been treated unfairly and later wrote a negative account of the incident in his magazine, claiming he was [...] "treated most discourteously by Madame W.

2500|$|... "I Will Try" [...] {{is about}} having a {{positive}} outlook on life. James has explained that he has 'a very negative outlook on the world' and that he can 'never really appreciate anything' so the song is a reminder to himself to try and {{look on the bright}} side. He continued; 'the line [...] "I've got friends who have lost their fathers and they're much stronger men than me" [...] refers mainly to Chris (Pennells, guitar), Jamie (manager) and <b>my</b> <b>dear</b> <b>friend</b> David Rice who have lost family members and yet still find a smile and appreciate all the upsides of life'. [...] "Little White Lies" [...] is about dishonesty. The song 'covers the way that lies eat away at my brain and cause me to almost lose my mind, yet I still keep making mistakes and bad decisions', according to James. He revealed little about the background of [...] "Leeches", saying only that 'Leeches is about something terrible and unspeakable that happened to someone who once made me very happy'. Speaking about [...] "Anemophobia", he said; 'the title of this song means a fear of wind, which I have, but the song on the whole though is about anxiety. ...This song was written when I was at my lowest point, I genuinely believed I was dying. ...The song is also about how lost I felt and still feel and how most days I don't feel like myself any more'. [...] "Fifty Four" [...] is about James' girlfriend. 'She is my only real sense of normality and I owe her more than I can write down in words for that'.|$|E

This hostility have increased so much during the winter that I have reached the end of my patience." [...] She expressed her view upon love and sexuality and when Gustav III studied certain letters after his late mother in the company of others, as they contained information regarding the alleged love affair between his mother Queen Louisa Ulrika av Count Carl Gustaf Tessin, and the complaints from Adolf Frederick, King of Sweden over the attention Tessin gave his consort:" [...] It is undoubtedly so, that these papers can give reason for reflection; it does lead me to consider how easily a poor woman is judged and how unfortunate it is to have a heart filled with emotion, for a tender nature is a misfortune as well as a blessing, and no human can resist the power of love, even though friendship must at times be the comfort for the wise one, yes, nothing is more true than the inscription who were once placed upon the image of God of Love: 'Eho you are, her is your true master, he has been, he is and always will be.' You have to admit, <b>my</b> <b>dear</b> <b>friend,</b> that woman is truly an unhappy creature: while men have their complete freedom, she is always burdened by prejudice and circumstance; you may say, that men also have that hindrance, but it is not in equal degree.
