For example, Greek-American opera singer Maria Callas—who reached her peak in the 1950s—became a gay icon because the uniquely compelling qualities of her stage performances were allied to a tempestuous private life, a sequence of unhappy love affairs, and a lonely premature death in Paris after her voice had deserted her.|$|E

However, there are a minority group of Teochew people who speak Minnan exclusively, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>have</b> had relatives and close contacts with their mainstream counterparts from their neighbouring Southern Fujian.

2500|$|Nearly all of Ian Fleming's Bond {{novels and}} short stories include {{one or more}} female {{characters}} who {{can be said to}} qualify as Bond girls, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>have</b> been adapted for the screen. While Fleming's Bond girls have some individual traits (at least in their literary forms), they also have a great many characteristics in common. One of these is age: The typical Bond girl is in her early to mid-twenties, roughly ten years younger than Bond, who seems to be perennially in his mid-thirties. Examples include Solitaire (25), Tatiana Romanova (24), Vivienne [...] "Viv" [...] Michel (23), and Kissy Suzuki (23). The youngest Bond girl (though she and Bond do not sleep together) may be Gala Brand; she is named for the cruiser in which her father is serving {{at the time of her}} birth. Bond's youngest sexual partner in the books is Mariko Ichiban, an 18-year-old masseuse in You Only Live Twice. The eldest Bond girls are Pussy Galore, whom Bond speculates is in her early 30s, and 29-year-old Domino Vitali.|$|E
2500|$|Yum cha (Jyutping: Jam2 caa4; Traditional Chinese: 飲茶, {{literally}} [...] "to drink tea") is a subculture within Cantonese food culture. While it can {{be found}} in some other Han Chinese groups, it is far more prevalent among Cantonese people, and also overseas Chinese, historically <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>have</b> been of Cantonese ancestry. It has a specific set of terminologies among Cantonese. For instance, [...] "to invite someone to go yum cha" [...] is basically a way of expressing friendship. Traditionally, Cantonese could go yum cha whether in the morning, afternoon, or evening. Morning tea is typically dominated by the elderly, although many younger people often accompany their grandparents for morning tea as a way of showing respect and affection. Cantonese teahouses also have a set of food specifically designed for morning tea. Afternoon tea is similar in most aspects, except it is more common for entire families to go yum cha at this hour. Evening tea tends to attract large gatherings - and the foods ordered in such hours also tend to be more sophisticated.|$|E
