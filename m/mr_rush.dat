[...] "With their volume turned up, the appealing, impeccably professional Mr. Firth and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rush</b> rise to the acting occasion by twinkling and growling as their characters warily circle each other before settling into the therapeutic swing of things and unknowingly preparing for the big speech that partly gives the film its title," [...] she wrote. The Daily Telegraph called Guy Pearce's performance as Edward VIII [...] "formidable ... with glamour, charisma and utter self-absorption". Empire said he played the role well as [...] "a flash harry flinty enough to shed a nation for a wife." [...] The New York Times thought {{he was able to}} create [...] "a thorny tangle of complications in only a few abbreviated scenes". Hooper praised the actor in the DVD commentary, saying he [...] "nailed" [...] the 1930s royal accent. Richard Corliss of Time magazine named Colin Firth's performance one of the Top 10 Movie Performances of 2010.|$|E
