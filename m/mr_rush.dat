[...] "With their volume turned up, the appealing, impeccably professional Mr. Firth and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rush</b> rise to the acting occasion by twinkling and growling as their characters warily circle each other before settling into the therapeutic swing of things and unknowingly preparing for the big speech that partly gives the film its title," [...] she wrote. The Daily Telegraph called Guy Pearce's performance as Edward VIII [...] "formidable ... with glamour, charisma and utter self-absorption". Empire said he played the role well as [...] "a flash harry flinty enough to shed a nation for a wife."
