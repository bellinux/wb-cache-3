Soon {{afterwards}} her first series of drawings on <b>millimeter</b> <b>paper</b> with lists of numbers, which resulted from complicated additions or multiplications of personally derived numerical sequences based on the four to six digits used to notate the date, month, and year of the standard Gregorian calendar.

Always written out by hand, her paperwork thus comprised rows and rows of ascending and descending numbers, u-shapes, grids, line-notations and boxes. Employing this neutral language of numbers and using pen, pencil, the typewriter, and graph paper as materials, she began to make simple linear constructions of numbers that she called Konstruktionen. Similar to On Kawara, Darboven offered a system to represent time as both the continuous flux of life and clear embracing order. Along with LeWitt and Andre, Lucy Lippard and Kasper König belonged to the circle of long-standing promoters of Darboven's work.|$|E

40|$|So einfach wie möglich, aber nicht einfacher. As {{simple as}} possible, but not simpler. This {{guideline}} of Albert Einstein obliges in particular each presentation of relativistic physics, a subject which often puzzles laymen, stirs their imagination and tantalizes their comprehension, unnecessarily, because relativistic physics relies on simple geometric notions. If {{one wants to}} understand the basic features {{of the theory of}} relativity then one does not need coordinates or virtual systems of clocks, which fill the universe, no more than <b>millimeter</b> <b>paper</b> and coordinate axes are required for Euclidean geometry. One only has to consider what observers see rather than to argue that this or that observer is right. Relativity is a physical, not a judicial theory. The slowdown of moving clocks and the shortening of a moving measuring rod unfold naturally from the principle of relativity, just as a tilted ladder is less high than an upright ladder. Clocks are no more mysterious than mileage meters, and show a distance between start and end which depends on the way in between. This is the unspectacular answer to the seemingly paradoxical aging of twins. Just as no one is puzzled by a triangle, where the straight line between two edges is shorter than the detour over the third edge, no one should be shocked by the conclusion and experimental verification, that a clock picks up more time on a straight history as compared to the twin clock of a traveler who takes a detour. The first two chapters are intended to be understandable in essence also to nonphysicists with little mathematical knowledge. Their simplicity, however, may be deceptive. Real understanding requires careful consideration of the arguments, the equations and the diagrams, preferably by reading equipped with a pencil and paper. The following chapters presume mathematical knowledge which physicists and mathematicians acquire during their undergraduate years. To clarify more complicated questions we introduce coordinates as functions of the measured times and directions of light rays and deduce the Lorentz transformations which relate these values to the ones which moving observers measure. These transformations determine how velocities combine, what pictures are seen by moving observers, and how the energy and momentum of a particle depend on its velocity. iii i...|$|E

After four years in orbit, preliminary analysis of the Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) data to LARES {{in combination with the}} SLR data from the LAGEOS 1 & 2 missions show an improvement in the measurement of Earth's frame-dragging. The frame-dragging phenomenon is predicted by General Relativity (GR) and it is induced by Earth's rotation that twists the space-time fabric and drags inertial frames with it. The orbital plane of an object subjected only to a central force determines an inertial frame according to Galilei-Newton mechanics. In GR however, that plane is dragged by the rotation of the central mass. The dragging of the orbital plane is in the same direction of the rotation of the body. This motion, very small around Earth, may be dramatically large around supermassive rotating black holes. The LARES mission experiment aims at measuring this effect around Earth with an accuracy of about 1 %, thus improving the previous measurement obtained with the two LAGEOS satellites by one order of magnitude. The data are collected by the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) network, from ground stations that transmit ultra-short laser pulses towards the 400 kg satellite equipped with retroreflectors and measure the travel time of the reflected pulse's arrival at the station. Using the data collected from the global ILRS network, one can determine LARES' orbital position with an accuracy that can reach a few <b>millimeters.</b> The <b>paper</b> will present the mission objectives and the design characteristics of the LARES satellite and will report the recent results obtained with the analysis of the two LAGEOS and LARES satellites' data using a recent gravitational field model for Earth, obtained from the dedicated GRACE and GOCE geopotential mapping missions.

The second factor is the frequency of (F), consisting of 3 levels, namely : F 1 (the frequency of 1 time), F 2 (frequency of 2 time/) and F 3 (frequency of 3 time). Variables observed high increase of seedling, stem diameter, leaf number, length of root, root number, fresh weight and dry weight. From the observation results showed that of growth regulators GA 3 0, 4 mg/l and the frequency of 2 time (Z 3 F 2) gave the best results compared with other treatments for all variable including the addition of observation height, stem diameter, leaf number, length root, root number, fresh weight and seedling dry weight resin...|$|R
40|$|Although {{extensively}} studied {{within the}} lidar community, the multiple scattering phenomenon {{has always been}} considered a rare curiosity by radar meteorologists. Up to few years ago its appearance has only been associated with two- or three-body-scattering features (e. g. hail flares and mirror images) involving highly reflective surfaces. Recent atmospheric research aimed at {{better understanding of the}} water cycle and the role played by clouds and precipitation in affecting the Earth's climate has driven the deployment of high frequency radars in space. Examples are the TRMM 13. 5 GHz, the CloudSat 94 GHz, the upcoming EarthCARE 94 GHz, and the GPM dual 13 - 35 GHz radars. These systems are able to detect the vertical distribution of hydrometeors and thus provide crucial feedbacks for radiation and climate studies. The shift towards higher frequencies increases the sensitivity to hydrometeors, improves the spatial resolution and reduces the size and weight of the radar systems. On the other hand, higher frequency radars are affected by stronger extinction, especially in the presence of large precipitating particles (e. g. raindrops or hail particles), which may eventually drive the signal below the minimum detection threshold. In such circumstances the interpretation of the radar equation via the single scattering approximation may be problematic. Errors will be large when the radiation emitted from the radar after interacting more than once with the medium still contributes substantially to the received power. This is the case if the transport mean-free-path becomes comparable with the instrument footprint (determined by the antenna beam-width and the platform altitude). This situation resembles to what has already been experienced in lidar observations, but with a predominance of wide- versus small-angle scattering events. At millimeter wavelengths, hydrometeors diffuse radiation rather isotropically compared to the visible or near infrared region where scattering is predominantly in the forward direction. A complete understanding of radiation transport modeling and data analysis methods under wide-angle multiple scattering conditions is mandatory for a correct interpretation of echoes observed by space-borne <b>millimeter</b> radars. This <b>paper</b> reviews the status of research in this field. Different numerical techniques currently implemented to account for higher order scattering are reviewed and their weaknesses and strengths highlighted. Examples of simulated radar backscattering profiles are provided with particular emphasis given to situations in which the multiple scattering contributions become comparable or overwhelm the single scattering signal. We show evidences of multiple scattering effects from air-borne and from CloudSat observations, i. e. unique signatures which cannot be explained by single scattering theory. Ideas how to identify and tackle the multiple scattering effects are discussed. Finally perspectives and suggestions for future work are outlined. This work represents a reference-guide for studies focused at modeling the radiation transport and at interpreting data from high frequency space-borne radar systems that probe highly opaque scattering media such as thick ice clouds or precipitating clouds...|$|R
