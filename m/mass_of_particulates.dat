40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Ptychoptera townesi (false crane fly, Diptera) {{occur in}} high densities in an {{experimental}} stream section {{that has not}} been allowed to exceed bankfull flow for more than two decades, but are quite rare in areas both upstream and downstream from this section. By contrast, Paraleptophlebia spp. (mayfly, Epherneroptera) are relatively abundant throughout the channel. Paraleptophlebia spp. are able to feed and grow on a variety of resource types, whereas Ptychoptera townesi are restricted to feeding on fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) less than 250 [mu]m in diameter, particularly 0. 45 - 53 [mu]m. Morphological and behavioral differences between these genera are indicative of differences in feeding capability. These genera also differ in response to refractory food resources. The alimentary tract of the dipteran is considerably more differentiated than the simple straight tube gut tract typical of the mayflies. In addition, Ptychoptera townesi consume relatively small amounts (per unit animal dry <b>mass)</b> <b>of</b> <b>particulates</b> (0. 45 - 53 [mu]m) compared with the mayflies ingestion of leaf material. Ptychoptera townesi have longer gut content passage times (> 19 h) and higher efficiencies of conversion of ingested substrate to body substance, under conditions studied, than do Paraleptophlebia spp. (2 - 3 h) on these respective food resources. Gut contents of Ptychoptera townesi become colonized by microbes typically found in the hindgut, and are compacted into pellets considerably larger in size than particles ingested. These animals lose mass when allowed to feed on this material. Ptychoptera townesi ingest and egest relatively sterile detrital material at a rate reduced from that on natural detritus. The pattern exhibited by Ptychoptera townesi involves slow handling of relatively small volumes of food, which probably pass once through an elaborate alimentary tract. That exhibited by Paraleptophlebia spp. involves rapid processing and partial recycling of large amounts of material through a relatively simple alimentary tract. Considered in a broader context, the results of this investigation have implications for the perceived role of deposit-feeding organisms in the organization and development of stream communities. Deposit-feeders are capable of far more than, as generally claimed, selecting particles on the basis of size, independent of food quality, and digesting primarily the associated microbes for their nutrition...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Inhalation <b>of</b> diesel <b>particulate</b> matter (DPM) {{is known}} to have a {{negative}} impact on human health. Consequently, there are regulations and standards that limit the maximum concentrations to which persons may be exposed and the maximum concentrations allowed in the ambient air. However, these standards consider steady exposure over large spatial and time scales. Due to the nature of many vehicle exhaust systems, pedestrians in close proximity to a vehicle's tailpipe may experience events where diesel particulate matter concentrations are high enough to cause acute health effects for brief periods of time. Methods In order to quantify these exposure events, instruments which measure specific exhaust constituent concentrations were placed near a roadway and connected to the mouth of a mannequin used as a pedestrian surrogate. By measuring concentrations at the mannequin's mouth during drive-by events with a late model diesel truck, a representative estimate of the exhaust constituent concentrations to which a pedestrian may be exposed was obtained. Typical breathing rates were then multiplied by the measured concentrations to determine the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> pollutant inhaled. Results The average concentration <b>of</b> diesel <b>particulate</b> matter measured over the duration of a single drive-by test often exceeded the low concentrations used in human clinical studies which are known to cause acute health effects. It was also observed that higher concentrations <b>of</b> diesel <b>particulate</b> matter were measured at the height of a stroller than were measured at the mouth of a mannequin. Conclusion Diesel particulate matter concentrations during drive-by incidents easily reach or exceed the low concentrations that can cause acute health effects for brief periods of time. For the case of a particularly well-tuned late-model year vehicle, the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>particulate</b> matter inhaled during a drive-by incident is small compared to the mass inhaled daily at ambient conditions. On a per breath basis, however, the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>particulate</b> matter inhaled is large compared to the mass inhaled at ambient conditions. Finally, it was determined that children, infants, or people breathing at heights similar to that of a passing vehicle's tailpipe may be exposed to higher concentrations <b>of</b> <b>particulate</b> matter than those breathing at higher locations, such as adults standing up. </p...|$|R

Raw exhaust particulate and its soluble organic extract were screened for biological activity using the Ames Salmonella typhimurium assay. Results are given for a test matrix made up of twelve steady-state operating conditions. For all conditions except the 1 / 4 rack (light load) condition, modest thermal efficiency gains were noted upon ethanol fumigation. Methanol showed the same increase at 3 / 4 and full rack (high load) conditions. However, engine roughness or the occurrence of severe knock limited the maximum amount of alcohol that could be fumigated.

This study examines the interaction of volcanic ash particles with metallic surfaces likely to be found on an aircraft, and its ability to charge those surfaces by impact. We do this by directing a high-pressure jet of mixed air and volcanic ash, sieved to < 63 μm dia., at fixed 50 mm x 50 mm target. The charging is quantified as the charge generated on the target surface per unit <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>particulate</b> impacted. By testing volcanic ash alongside a control material (Ballotini™) which is not expected to fracture the study provides evidence that fracto-emission is the dominant charging process. It is demonstrated that volcanic ash impacting a metallic target at <b>mass</b> delivery rates <b>of</b> approximately 5 mg s- 1 can generate charge to <b>mass</b> ratios <b>of</b> 0. 5 to 0. 8 C kg- 1 at impact speeds in the range of 60 to 70 ms- 1.

The study includes the investigation of two types of volcanic ash, sand and some qualitative work to investigate the impact of ice on the targets. From this we conclude that the measurement <b>of</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>mass</b> concentration is possible, and discrimination <b>of</b> <b>particulate</b> type is possible by exposing multiple target materials in parallel.

40|$|AbstractInvestigations that {{rank the}} tendencies of single-component fuels to form soot have given useful {{insights}} into how molecules and local molecular structure influences {{the conversion of}} carbon in fuel to soot. These studies can provide fundamental understanding of how functional group chemistry influences the products formed during pyrolysis or combustion. A series of experiments have been conducted which investigate the conversion of oxygenated and hydrocarbon C 2 molecules (ethanol, ethane, and ethylene) to particulate matter (PM) and other species (CO, CO 2). Single-component fuels have been tested in a laminar flow reactor at concentrations of 8000 ppmv, under pyrolysis conditions. Size and <b>mass</b> distributions <b>of</b> <b>particulates</b> are reported, measured {{by means of a}} differential mobility spectrometer (Cambustion DMS 500) ...|$|R
40|$|Soot toxification: The {{increasing}} chemical {{activity of}} the emitted soot particulate produced by modern diesel engines is an unwanted side effect of modification of the motors. This makes Euro IV and VI soots chemically and biologically highly active and hazardous. Taking these factors into consideration, the question arises whether the reduced net <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> diesel soot <b>particulate</b> emitted overcompensates for the induced micro- and nanostructure...|$|R
40|$|A method {{based on}} remote sensing of one emitted product - {{particulates}} is {{developed for the}} global assessment of trace gases and particulates emission from tropical biomass burning. According to the method, the detected <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> emitted <b>particulates</b> is converted into a <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> emitted trace gases using published relations between the emitted particulates and trace gases for the flaming and smoldering phases. Through {{an analysis of the}} 1987 burning season in Brazil during the three months of the dry season, it is shown that there are up to 8000 fires a day each contributing 4500 tons of CO(2), 750 tons of CO, and 26 tons of CH(4) to the atmosphere. A comparison to the estimates of global emissions is also presented...|$|R
