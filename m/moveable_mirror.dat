40|$|In {{the last}} few years Programmable Micro Diffraction Gratings (PMDG) have shown the {{possibility}} to be applied in many areas, spanning from imaging, to telecommunication, to spectroscopy. These devices were mainly based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) techniques and realized by <b>moveable</b> <b>mirrors</b> and pop-up structures. Although this approach have held a central stage in Micro-Opto-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MOEMS), they made the realized devices delicate and not useful for some critical environments.

40|$|Laser surface {{structuring}} is {{an innovative}} manufacturing technology as it offers high flexibility {{with regard to}} a range of materials. The technology itself is based on material ablation caused by the energy transfer of pulsed laser radiation into heat. In order to deflect the pulsed laser beam on the workpiece surface, usually, a scanner system with two <b>moveable</b> <b>mirrors</b> is used. The mirrors are moved by high dynamic galvanometers. However, because of the inertia of the mirrors, the ablation is not evenly distributed along a marking path which is defined by a vector movement. The distribution density of the single laser pulses is higher in the areas of mirror acceleration as compared to the area of constant velocity. A new and innovative strategy has been developed at the Fraunhofer IPT to automatically analyze the behavior of the scanner system as well as to compensate the acceleration regions adapted to the used processing strategy and the machine system...|$|R
40|$|The {{observed}} {{field of}} view on optical telescopes is often limited by detector size, and is smaller than the one available imaged by the telescope optics. This in turn constrains the number and quality of available calibration stars for each observed target. The Multi-Mirror Feed is an instrument intended for the MINERVA optical telescope, and is designed {{to make use of}} a large {{field of view}} even while constrained by a relatively small detector [...] such as a CCD or PMT array. This increases {{the quantity and quality of}} available calibration stars while lowering the cost of the instrument. Wide fields of view are collapsed by selecting only the portions of the field which contain the target and calibration stars, using several small, <b>moveable</b> <b>mirrors</b> in the focal plane. This paper discusses the software developed to select these calibration stars using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The software will help optimize the performance of the MMF in both quality of data collected, and the observing time required to operate it...|$|R

40|$|Strong {{magnetic}} field shear around the divertor x-point is numerically predicted {{to lead to}} strong spatial asymmetries in turbulence driven particle fluxes.

A reentrant sapphire window with a <b>moveable</b> in-vessel <b>mirror</b> images the divertor region from the center stack out to R 80 cm and views the x-point for most plasma configurations. A coherent fiber optic bundle transmits the image through a remotely selected filter to a fast camera, for example a 40500 frames/sec Photron CCD camera.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the ITER ECRH upper port antenna (or launcher) will be to drive current locally to {{stabilise}} the NTMs (depositing ECCD inside of the island that forms on either the q= 3 / 2 or 2 rational magnetic flux surfaces) and control the sawtooth instability (deposit ECCD near the q= 1 surface). The launcher should be capable of steering the focused beam deposition location to the resonant flux surface over the range in which the q= 1, 3 / 2 and 2 surfaces {{are expected to be}} found, for the various plasma equilibria susceptible to the onset of NTMs and sawteeth. ITER’s present reference design uses a front steering (FS) concept, with the <b>moveable</b> <b>mirror</b> close to the plasma. Two separate mirrors are used to decouple the focussing and steering aspects resulting in an optimised optical configuration providing a well focused beam over a large steering range. The launcher is capable of steering eight 2 MW beams in all of the four allocated upper port plugs.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} model for the {{kinematics}} and dynamics of optomechanics which describe the coupling between an optical field, here modeled by a massless scalar field, and the internal (e. g., determining its reflectivity) and mechanical (e. g., displacement) degrees of freedom of a <b>moveable</b> <b>mirror.</b> As opposed to implementing boundary conditions on the field we highlight the internal dynamics of the mirror which provides added flexibility to describe a variety of setups relevant to current experiments. The inclusion of the internal degrees of freedom in this model allows for a variety of optical activities of mirrors from those exhibiting broadband reflective properties to the cases where reflection is suppressed except for a narrow band centered around the characteristic frequency associated with the mirror's internal dynamics. After establishing the model and the reflective properties of the mirror we show how appropriate parameter choices lead to useful optomechanical models such as the well known Barton-Calogeracos model [G. Barton and A. Calogeracos, Ann. Phys. 238, 227 (1995) ] and the important yet lesser explored nonlinear models (e. g., $Nx$ coupling) for small photon numbers $N$, which present models based on side-band approximations [H. Kimble et al., Phys. Rev. D 65, 022002 (2001) ] cannot cope with. As a simple illustrative application we consider classical radiation pressure cooling with this model. To expound its theoretical structure and physical meanings we connect our model to field-theoretical models using auxiliary fields and the ubiquitous Brownian motion model of quantum open systems. Finally we describe the range of applications of this model, from a full quantum mechanical treatment of radiation pressure cooling, quantum entanglement between macroscopic mirrors, to the backreaction of Hawking radiation on black hole evaporation in a moving mirror analog.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a study of the instrumentation tolerances for a conventional style Michelson stellar interferometer (MSI). The method used to determine the tolerances was to determine the change, due to the instrument errors, in the measured fringe visibility and phase relative to the ideal values. The ideal values are those values of fringe visibility and phase that would be measured by a perfect MSI and are attributable solely to the object being detected. Once the functional relationship for changes in visibility and phase as a function of various instrument errors is understood it is then possible to set limits on the instrument errors {{in order to ensure that}} the measured visibility and phase are different from the ideal values by no more than some specified amount. This was done as part of this study. The limits we obtained are based on a visibility error of no more than 1 % and a phase error of no more than 0. 063 radians (this comes from 1 % of 2 (pi) radians). The choice of these 1 % limits is supported in the literture. The approach employed in the study involved the use of ASAP (Advanced System Analysis Program) software provided by Breault Research Organization, Inc., in conjunction with parallel analytical calculations. The interferometer accepts object radiation into two separate arms each consisting of an outer mirror, an inner mirror, a delay line (made up of two <b>moveable</b> <b>mirrors</b> and two static mirrors), and a 10 : 1 afocal reduction telescope. The radiation coming out of both arms is incident on a slit plane which is opaque with two openings (slits). One of the two slits is centered directly under one of the two arms of the interferometer and the other slit is centered directly under the other arm. The slit plane is followed immediately by an ideal combining lens which images the radiation in the fringe plane (also referred to subsequently as the detector plane) ...|$|R

The large box trailer featured sliding side doors, opening rear doors and was finished in the blue and silver 'Express Services' livery.

40|$|A {{spaceborne}} {{lidar system}} for atmospheric studies was defined. The primary input was the Science Objectives Experiment Description and Evolutionary Flow Document. The first {{task of the}} study was to perform an experiment evolutionary analysis of the SEED. The second task was the system definition effort of the instrument system. The third task was the generation of a program plan for the hardware phase. The fourth task was the supporting studies which included a Shuttle deficiency analysis, a preliminary safety hazard analysis, the identification of long lead items, and development studies required. As a result of the study an evolutionary Lidar Multi-User Instrument System (MUIS) was defined. The MUIS occupies a full Spacelab pallet and has a weight of 1300 kg.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{dynamics}} of optomechanical systems, which use radiation pressure to couple together optical and mechanical modes. Such systems display dynamics ranging from the quantum to the classical, {{with a variety of}} applications including ground state cooling and precision measurements. In this thesis two different geometries are presented for such a system {{in the form of the}} ‘reflective’ and ‘dispersive’ systems. Different aspects of the dynamics are investigated numerically and analytically. Firstly the reflective system is introduced, which consists of a cavity formed from a fixed and a <b>moveable</b> <b>mirror.</b> The optical frequency of the cavity couples linearly to the moveable mirror’s position. This geometry is explored as the cavity is driven by a laser, revealing a range of dynamical states in the mirror as the drive frequency is varied. An alternative geometry is presented in the form of the dispersive optomechanical system. Two fixed mirrors with a partially transmitting membrane at the centre provide a cavity supporting two optical modes, that couple approximately linearly or quadratically to the membrane position, depending on where the membrane is fixed. The system is explored in both linear and quadratic coupling regimes. Quadratic coupling is explored for a single optical mode by selecting a high tunnelling rate through the membrane. The dynamics of the membrane are explored via a similar set of techniques to those applied to the reflective system. Linear coupling for two optical modes is explored in the regimes of blue and red detuning. First resolved sideband cooling is explored, providing an alternative approach ground state cooling (which has been explored for the reflective case). Finally, strongly driving the system over a range of coupling strengths induces classical behaviour, extending from limit cycle oscillations to chaotic motion...|$|E
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of last century Einstein derived the statistics of the radiation pressure force fluctuactions acting on a <b>moveable</b> <b>mirror.</b> Later, pioneering experiments {{about the role of}} radiation pressure and its ability to provide cooling for large objects were carried on by Braginsky in the context of interferometers during the 60 s. The dynamical influence of radiation pressure on a harmonically suspended end-mirror of a cavity was investigated, revealing that the retarded nature of the force provides either damping or anti-damping of mechanical motion. The first cavity optomechanical experiment in the optical domain demonstrated bistability of the radiation pressure force acting on a macroscopic end-mirror. The fundamental consquences of the quantum fluctuations of radiation pressure impose a limit on how accurately the position of a test mass can be measured and the standard quantum limit for continuous position detection was then established. The original task concerning my PhD Thesis is the observation of radiation pressure acting on a mechanical object due to light circulating inside a Fabry-Perot cavity. This evidence would trace the path to observe the standard quantum limit through optical methods allowing to perform quantum measurements, and the realization of coherent superposition of the states of macroscopic objects. A plethora of different systems was introduced starting from the last decades of the 20 th century in order to explore both theoretically and experimentally the behaviour of optomechanical systems. On the experimental side the most part of the approaches were to miniaturize the investigated structure. Optomechanical effects of retarded radiation forces were observed in microscale setups. However, the task of producing high quality optical cavities below mm-scale remains quite challeging. The route that was followed is the membrane-in-the-middle setup. Previous theoretical proposals and experimental implementations have analysed the possibility of setting up this kind of research using a movable mirror as end mirror of the FP cavity. Later the research focused on a new interpretation of the problem, placing a SiN membrane (a few tens of nanometers of thickness) between the two mirrors. We performed a detailed study of dynamical back-action cooling and of radiation pressure induced modifications of the mechanical properties of the membrane. In particular we have studied how the mechanical susceptibility is modified by such interaction between radiation pressure and a driven cavity mode. We finally observed that the increase of mechanical damping is equivalent to cooling of the vibrational mode and we measured its effective temperature in three different ways, obtaining consistent results, in agreement with theoretical expectations...|$|E
