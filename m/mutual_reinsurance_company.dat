[...] "The Iowa Farmers Mutual Reinsurance Association was the first statewide organization {{of its kind in}} the United States." [...] When it moved to Grinnell from Jefferson, Iowa in 1934 its name was changed to Farmers <b>Mutual</b> <b>Reinsurance</b> <b>Company.</b> It was still a relatively small operation at the time that required only simple rented upstairs quarters. The present building was first occupied in 1951, but only the first two floors were built. The top two floors were completed in 1957, and gave the building its present form. The company rented out the first floor to other commercial businesses. Farmers <b>Mutual</b> <b>Reinsurance</b> <b>Company</b> moved out of building in 1962 to a larger complex south of Grinnell, and at that time became known as the Grinnell <b>Mutual</b> <b>Reinsurance</b> <b>Company.</b> This building was sold to the General Telephone Company, which occupied the whole building until 1968. The Trustees of Iowa (Grinnell) College, GTE Data of Iowa, and DeLong's Sportswear have all subsequently owned the building.|$|E
