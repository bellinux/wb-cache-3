40|$|Earthquakes occur along faults in {{response}} to plate tectonic movements, but paradoxically, are not widely recognized in the geological record, severely limiting our knowledge of earthquake physics and hampering accurate assessments of seismic hazard. Light-reflective (so-called mirror like) fault surfaces are widely observed geological features, especially in carbonate-bearing rocks of the shallow crust. Here {{we report on the}} occurrence of <b>mirror-like</b> fault <b>surfaces</b> cutting dolostone gouges in the Italian Alps. Using friction experiments, we demonstrate that the <b>mirror-like</b> <b>surfaces</b> develop only at seismic slip rates (∼ 1 m/s) and for applied normal stresses and sliding displacements consistent with those estimated on the natural faults. Under these experimental conditions, the frictional power density dissipated in the samples is comparable to that estimated for natural earthquakes (1 – 10 MW/m 2). Our results indicate that <b>mirror-like</b> <b>surfaces</b> in dolostone gouges are a signature of seismic faulting, and can be used to estimate power dissipation during ancient earthquake ruptures...|$|R

This paper aim to investigate the surface roughness improvement and the limit surface roughness of the BK 7 optical glass for <b>mirror-like</b> <b>surface</b> finish. Due to the brittleness of workpiece, lapping pressure need to be controlled diligently to prevent crack and brittle fracture from occurring. At first, the new lapping tool is installed on the collect chuck of the CNC milling machine and lapping is performed by the table movement in X and Y direction by NC control.

40|$|The {{microstructure}} of machined metals changes {{near the}} tool-affected zone. This paper presents some new results concerning <b>mirror-like</b> <b>surface</b> cutting of aluminum, copper and tungsten. The microstructure of aluminum and copper represents polycrystalline mild metals with {{face centered cubic}} (FCC) crystal structure. Examination of a <b>mirror-like</b> <b>surface</b> by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron backscattered diffraction and atomic force microscopy revealed that grain boundaries and twin boundaries were present, which separates two domains for different crystal orientation. The Young's modulus that depends on orientation can change considerably on these boundaries and, consequently, the value of elastic deformation of the layer under the machined surface. This effect modified the roughness. Ultraprecision machining of tungsten, which is a body centered cubic (BCC) metal, proved useless using diamond and/or boron-nitride tools. Since tungsten is a very brittle metal at room temperature, its ductile to brittle transition temperature is much higher. Therefore, in contrast to normal cutting, the material that is incapable of plastic deformation will cause brittle fracture of the chip and bad surface quality...|$|R

We leverage this result in order to derive a photometric invariant that is associated with parabolic curvature points. Further, we show that these invariant curves can be effectively extracted from just a few images of the object in uncontrolled, uncalibrated environments without the need for any apriori information about the surface shape. Since these parabolic curves are a geometric property of the surface, they can then be used as features for a variety of machine vision tasks. This is especially powerful, since there are very few vision algorithms that can handle such <b>mirror-like</b> <b>surfaces.</b> We show the potential of the proposed invariant using experiments on two related applications- object recognition and pose estimation for smooth mirror surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Wave front sensing is {{an optical}} method {{allowing}} non-contacting topography measurements of flat surfaces. Applications {{of the method}} are, for instance, the characterization of optical components, semiconductor surfaces, or subcomponents used in semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The method developed here is covering the characterization of flatness on <b>mirror-like</b> <b>surfaces</b> within three orders of magnitude from micro- to nanometer scale. This {{is due to the}} high range of detectable surface slopes from very low to relatively high values. Therefore, the method is applicable to both, micro- and nanometer scale height deviations on surfaces. The wave front sensing is capable of studying the topography in a real-time operating mode. The technique enables vertical resolution of approximately 10 nm at a lateral resolution of 0. 6 mm on bare silicon wafer surfaces. Moreover, highly reflective surfaces with height deviations of 10 - 15 µm could be easily resolved at a lateral resolution of 2. 4 mm. In this study, we focused on the application in semiconductor surfaces and manufacturing equipment: measurements were performed on bare wafers {{as well as on the}} <b>mirror-like</b> <b>surface</b> of a wafer holder used for wafer polishing (a 'polishing head').
