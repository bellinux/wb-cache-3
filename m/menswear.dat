5|$|UK {{department}} store retailer Debenhams' collaboration with designers, launched in 1993 under their Designers at Debenhams range, was a success. Hoping to recapture {{some of their}} lost market share, Marks and Spencer (M) asked Everest to review their <b>menswear</b> range. As Creative Consultant, he designed the Sartorial suiting line for their <b>menswear</b> collection. In October 2000, he designed the Autograph suiting line. Noting that the M range consisted of Italian-style suiting, he aimed to achieve a more 'British' look from the cut, fit and styling and by using different fabrics and colours. He also has responsibility for their Luxury collection. During M advertising campaigns, his designs for the Autograph range have been modelled by several British celebrities, including David Beckham, Bryan Ferry, Jimmy Carr, Martin Freeman, Bob Mortimer and Take That. In 2007, M were selected by The Football Association as 'Official Tailor to the England football team' and Everest designed the team's official suits for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Between {{these two}} seasons, Bradman seriously {{contemplated}} playing professional cricket in England with the Lancashire League club Accrington, a move that, {{according to the}} rules of the day, would have ended his Test career. A consortium of three Sydney businesses offered an alternative. They devised a two-year contract whereby Bradman wrote for Associated Newspapers, broadcast on Radio 2UE and promoted the <b>menswear</b> retailing chain FJ Palmer and Son. However, the contract increased Bradman's dependence on his public profile, making it more difficult to maintain the privacy that he ardently desired.|$|E
5|$|Fay Ripley (born 26 February 1966) is an English {{actress and}} recipe author. She is a {{graduate}} of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama (1990). Her first professional role was in the chorus of a pantomime version of Around the World in 80 Days. Ripley's early film and television appearances were limited, so she supplemented her earnings by working as a children's entertainer and by selling <b>menswear</b> door-to-door. After her scenes as a prostitute were cut from Frankenstein (1994), Ripley gained her first major film role playing Karen Hughes in Mute Witness (1995).|$|E
5|$|The {{clothing}} store Simpson's was established at 203-206 Piccadilly by Alec Simpson in 1936, who provided factory-made men's clothing. The premises {{were designed by}} the architect Joseph Amberton in a style that mixed art deco and Bauhaus school design and an influence from Louis Sullivan.

5|$|President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama {{attended}} 10 official inaugural balls {{during the}} evening of January 20, 2009. Barack Obama wore a new tuxedo made by Hart Schaffner Marx, a Chicago-based <b>menswear</b> company. He also wore a white bow tie, instead of the conventional black. Traditionalists considered this a fashion faux pas, as a white tie is conventionally only worn with a white waistcoat and tails. Michelle Obama wore a white, one-shouldered, sleeveless gown designed by 26-year-old NewYork-based designer JasonWu, breaking with the recent practice set by former first ladies Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton, who showcased designers from their hometowns.|$|E
5|$|Determined {{to become}} part of the fashion industry, but unable to make a breakthrough, Everest decided to use his {{knowledge}} of tailoring. He answered an advertisement placed in the London Evening Standard, in 1982, by Tommy Nutter; 'Boy wanted in Savile Row'. He pestered Nutter for weeks, until he was given the job. Nutter's client base included rock stars, celebrities, politicians and businessmen; he famously dressed The Beatles and The Stones. Everest also mixed with future celebrities of the fashion world. John Galliano, who had been studying at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, passed on some design skills to Everest, while on work placement with Nutter. Everest met his future wife Catherine (now an actress and film producer) at this time, while she was also working with Nutter. The couple have two daughters. Everest's time under Nutter, a Savile Row revolutionary in the 1960s, inspired him to experiment with tone and pattern in his own designs. In 1986, after nearly five years as Nutter's apprentice, Everest was persuaded to move on to work for Malcolm Levene. He had become disillusioned with Savile Row, particularly with their lack of appreciation for Nutter's more modern approach. Everest found that working with Levene, a small <b>menswear</b> retailer based away from Savile Row, on Chiltern Street, provided a welcome change. During Everest's first year there, Levene's turnover doubled.|$|E
5|$|Everest {{is at the}} {{forefront}} of the bespoke casual movement which, as the name suggests, provides individually tailored casual clothing of Savile Row quality, including: casual shirts; smart-casual jackets; T-shirts; and jeans. In collaboration with Levi's in 2004, he designed a tailored-denim suit, sold in Japanese retailer Oki-Ni's stores. Expanding the bespoke casual concept, he offered a bespoke denim tailoring service dressing celebrities from sports, Hollywood and rock music, such as David Beckham, Kevin Bacon and Ricky Wilson of the Kaiser Chiefs. Everest designed a suit collection in 2004/05 in collaboration with Rocawear, the fashion clothing company founded by American hip hop artists Damon Dash and Jay-Z. The advertising campaign was fronted by Dash's friends Kevin Bacon and Naomi Campbell. He teamed up with British casual and sportswear designer Kim Jones during 2005 and 2006. The collaboration produced tailoring collections for four seasons that were shown on the catwalk at Paris fashion week. For his next collaboration, in 2006 Everest showed a limited collection of <b>menswear</b> with New York hair salon Bumble and bumble, including a fully bespoke denim line, which retailed at around US$1,000. Marketed as a 'destination location', the retail space on the store's 8th floor, in the fashionable Meatpacking District of Manhattan, also featured a barbershop, a café and a teahouse. In autumn 2007, the Timothy Everest ready-to-wear collection was available in shops for the first time, including Flannels, Liberty and John Lewis. The range included suits, shirts and trousers. He was costume designer for the 2008 film Mamma Mia!, dressing its stars, including Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth. He opened a West End store in 2008, at Bruton Street, Mayfair, off Bond Street; less than five minutes walk from Savile Row. He has been a creative contributor and Sartorial Advisor to men's magazine The Rake since 2008.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, a {{consortium}} of three Sydney businesses offered an alternative. They devised a two-year contract whereby Bradman would write for Associated Newspapers, broadcast regularly on Radio 2UE and promote the <b>menswear</b> retailing chain FJ Palmer and Son. The contract was substantially less than the money on offer from Accrington, and it would increase Bradman's dependence on his public profile, thus {{making it more difficult}} to lead the private life that he desired. In addition, writing for the newspapers would again bring him into conflict with the administrators.|$|E
25|$|The label {{was started}} in Tokyo by Rei Kawakubo in 1969 and {{established}} as a company Comme des Garçons Co. Ltd in 1973. It is written in Japanese as コム・デ・ギャルソン (Komu de Gyaruson).

25|$|In February 2012, XIX Entertainment {{launched}} the best selling David Beckham bodywear range in 2,500 H stores around the world.

25|$|Simpsons {{continued}} {{to trade in}} the Simpsons Piccadilly building for several decades more, helping officers and civilians during World War II, and in later years branched out to sell other clothing by designer labels such as Armani and Christian Dior Since 1999 Simpsons stopped trading at the Piccadilly store and moved the renamed DAKS to a new flagship store and London offices to Old Bond Street, whilst moving to another new store on Jermyn Street which was recently refurbished in 2012 to focus on selling classic <b>menswear.</b> The original store was sold to bookseller Waterstone's and now serves as their flagship store.|$|E
25|$|Lamoureux and Walker {{turned the}} company around quickly and in 1982, Lamoureux left the company. A year later, Walker died unexpectedly. That year brought in $28.3 million. However, {{some of the}} {{cost-cutting}} measures implemented by Lamoureux and Walker— including cutbacks in research and in advertising— hurt the company more than helping it. In 1986, after being away from the company for nine years, former lingerie division president Linda J. Wachner engineered a $550 million hostile takeover Wachner had previously risen through the ranks at Max Factor, making the declining cosmetics company profitable again within just two years. She wasted no time at Warnaco and right away went to work streamlining the company’s fifteen divisions into just two categories: <b>menswear</b> and underwear.|$|E
25|$|The early 1880s was {{a period}} of stylistic confusion. On one hand, there is the over-ornamented {{silhouette}} with contrasting texture and frivolous accessories. On the other hand, the growing popularity of tailoring gave rise to an alternative, severe style. Some credited the change in silhouette to the Victorian dress reform, which consisted of a few movements including the Aesthetic Costume Movement and the Rational Dress Movement in the mid-to-late Victorian Era advocating natural silhouette, lightweight underwear, and rejecting tightlacing. However, these movements did not gain widespread support. Others noted the growth in cycling and tennis as acceptable feminine pursuits that demanded a greater ease of movement in women's clothing. Still others argued that the growing popularity of tailored semi-masculine suits was simply a fashionable style, and indicated neither advanced views nor the need for practical clothes. Nonetheless, the diversification in options and adoption of what was considered <b>menswear</b> at that time coincided with growing power and social status of women towards the late-Victorian period.|$|E
25|$|Numerous large {{companies}} {{had been established}} in Dunedin, many of which became national leaders. Late among them was Fletcher Construction, founded by Sir James Fletcher in the early 20th century. Kempthorne Prosser, established in 1879 in Stafford Street, was the largest fertiliser and drug manufacturer {{in the country for}} over 100 years. G. Methven, a metalworking and tap manufacturer based in South Dunedin, was also a leading firm, as was H. E. Shacklock, an iron founder and appliance manufacturer later taken over by the Auckland concern Fisher and Paykel. The Mosgiel Woollens was another Victorian Dunedin foundation. Hallensteins was the colloquial name of a <b>menswear</b> manufacturer and national retail chain while the DIC and Arthur Barnett were department stores, the former a nationwide concern. Coulls, Somerville Wilkie – later part of the Whitcoulls group – had its origins in Dunedin in the 19th century. There were also the National Mortgage and Agency Company of New Zealand, Wright Stephensons Limited, the Union Steamship Company and the National Insurance Company and the Standard Insurance Company among many others, which survived into the 20th century.|$|E

500|$|After {{completing}} her A-levels, Ripley sought {{entry to}} the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. It took her three attempts before she was accepted onto an acting course {{at the age of}} 20. While at drama school, Ripley lived in a flat in Streatham, South London, during a time she described as [...] "horrible and penniless". To support herself financially, she sold <b>menswear</b> door-to-door, timeshares on Kensington High Street and Oxford Street, worked as a receptionist at a health club, and spent five years as children's entertainer [...] "Miss Chief the Clown". As Miss Chief, Ripley performed magic tricks and painted faces at children's parties. The work paid off when she was able to get a mortgage on her first flat, stating clown as her occupation.|$|E
500|$|... "Hollywood" [...] {{was also}} remixed by American DJ duo Blow-Up. The remix {{was set to}} be {{included}} on Madonna's second remix album planned for 2004; however, it remained unreleased.

An unofficial remix was commissioned to DJ Junior Vasquez for designer Donatella Versace's spring/summer 2004 <b>menswear</b> show in Milan, {{in spite of the}} singer having a falling out with Vasquez, following the DJ releasing an unauthorized single titled [...] "If Madonna Calls". The original version that Vasquez played at nightclubs contained an actual phone message from Madonna left on Vasquez's answering machine. Madonna's publicist Liz Rosenberg confirmed that this did not mean the singer would collaborate with Vasquez in the future since the commissioning of the remix was just a [...] "personal favor" [...] for Versace.|$|E
