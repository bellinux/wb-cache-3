The first metatarsal, as a cornerstone structure of the foot, presum-ably expresses diaphyseal morphology that reflects loading history of the foot during stance phase of gait. Human feet differ substantially from those of other apes in terms of loading histories when comparing {{the path of the}} center of pressure during stance phase, which re-flects different weight transfer mechanisms. Here we use a novel approach for quantifying continuous thickness and cross-sectional geometric properties of long bones in order to test explicit hypotheses about loading histories and diaphyseal structure of adult chimpanzee, gorilla, and human first metatarsals. For each hallucal metatarsal, 17 cross sections were extracted at regularly-spaced intervals (2. 5 % length) between 25 % and 65 % length.

40|$|Abstract- In {{this work}} the {{internal}} stress equations for pinned portal frames under {{different kinds of}} loading was formulated using the equilibrium method. Unlike similar equations in structural engineering textbooks these equations considered the effect of deformation due to shearing forces. This effect was captured in a dimensionless constant α, when α is set to zero, the effect of shear deformation is removed and the equations become the same as what can be obtained in any structural engineering textbook. An investigation into the effect of shear deformation on the internal stresses and its variation with the ratios <b>of</b> second <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> the horizontal and vertical members of the frame () and the ratio of height to length of the portal frame () showed {{that the effect of}} shear deformation is generally small and can be conveniently neglected in manual calculations except for pinned portal frames under concentrated horizontal forces where the effect was considerable...|$|R

This resistance is tied to whichever specific axis about which the bending is being applied. Also called mandible robusticity, this characteristic allows for much stronger mastication of food. However, calculations made using biomechanical models does not necessarily perfectly predict the efficiency of different mandibular compositions in resistance to bending forces. Shearing {{is also an important}} factor in mastication effectiveness, and resistance to shear is proportional to the cross sectional <b>area</b> <b>of</b> the teeth. In postcanine Megadontia specimens, the cross sectional area is on average much larger than modern hominids which implies greater shear stress resistance.|$|R
