5|$|I {{really wanted}} {{to sit down with}} Wale before I wrote the hook, because to me, it's really lame when people send you tracks, and they're like, 'All right, Gaga, throw your vocals on it.' This is Wale's record. It's not <b>my</b> <b>record.</b> It's one of those songs, one of those tracks and one of those videos that you can't stop {{listening}} to.|$|E

It is defensive, absolutely. But it's also sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek. And I'm not sorry. I do not apologize for any of it.|$|E

During a time of war, {{during a time of}} {{economic}} hardship, when asked to serve your country in a sensitive position where you can actually bring a background to help your nation, I'm the kind of person who's going to stand up and do it, and I'll take that philosophy to my grave... In terms of the stimulus you talked about, it was failed. [...] And {{let me tell you what}} I talked about with respect to the stimulus. I talked about the need for more tax cuts in the stimulus... We had done historic tax cuts. We created a flat tax in the state of Utah, exactly what needs to happen in this country. We got the economy moving. We became the number-one job creator in this nation and the best managed state. That's exactly what needs to happen in this nation.

500|$|While {{recording}} her demo album, Swift {{worked with}} demo producer Nathan Chapman, whom she {{met in a}} little shed behind a publishing company she was at. Swift said, [...] "I'd always {{go in there and}} play him some new songs, and the next week he would have this awesome track, on which he played every instrument, and it sounded like a record. We did this for a period of a year to two years before I got <b>my</b> <b>record</b> deal." ...|$|E

Despite the years of animosity during Blur and Oasis' respective heyday, Albarn said: [...] "We’re talking. It’s not anything {{to get excited about}} yet. I mean, he’s doing his thing. He’s finishing a new record. I’ve got <b>my</b> <b>record</b> coming out, but the principle of us making music together is something, you know. It would be fair to say, we have discussed it at least once." ...|$|E
500|$|Swift did {{not want}} any misconceptions of Beautiful Eyes as her second album and {{therefore}} partnered with the American retail company Wal-Mart to make the EP an exclusive release. The album was only made available through American Wal-Mart stores and Wal-Mart's website. Furthermore, it was made a limited release because Swift only allowed Big Machine Records to manufacture {{a certain number of}} copies of the EP. She said, [...] "I’m only letting <b>my</b> <b>record</b> company make a small amount of these. The last thing I want any of you to think is that we are putting out too many releases." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Furtado, in the studio, Timbaland {{had some}} beats that were [...] "already kind of halfway there; {{and then he}} had beats that he just had nucleuses of; and then other stuff we jammed together". While she was working with Timbaland and Danja in Miami, Pharrell Williams {{introduced}} Furtado to reggaeton, a musical genre that was unfamiliar to her. After he played a song for her, Furtado became inspired and wrote the lyrics to [...] "No Hay Igual" [...] "nearly on the spot". In an interview with MTV News, Furtado joked: [...] "Supposedly it was Pharrell's idea for me to work with Tim [...] Jimmy Iovine, the head of <b>my</b> <b>record</b> label , might beg to differ." ...|$|E

500|$|Speaking for MTV News, Jay-Z {{responded to}} Braxton's claims: [...] "I wouldn't {{want to take}} it from her. I don't even think like that. My first thought would be, 'Maybe I could call her up, maybe I could get on that record.' The most obvious [...] is it's neither one of our records. It's not like you made an {{original}} idea. She's not in hip-hop, but it happens in hip-hop often. We go to sample the same thing and <b>my</b> <b>record</b> came out first. I'm sorry. What can I do?" [...] He went on saying that if he had known they were both planning to sample the same Tupac song, he would have arranged a duet with her.|$|E
500|$|... "Warner Bros. Records is a {{hierarchy}} of old men and it's a chauvinist environment {{to be working in}} because I'm treated like this sexy little girl. I had to prove them wrong, which meant not only proving myself to my fans but to <b>my</b> <b>record</b> company as well. That is something that happens when you're a girl. It wouldn't happen to Prince or Michael Jackson. I had to do everything on my own and it was hard trying to convince people that I was worth a record deal. After that, I had the same problem trying to convince the record company that I had more to offer than a one-shot singer. I had to win this fight." ...|$|E
500|$|Fanning {{has stated}} that {{although}} political messages may be common throughout his and Powderfinger's music, {{it is not the}} central focus when writing songs: [...] "A balance has to be struck in a lot of ways, in the sense that primarily I'm a musician. I'm not a political commentator. So if I write a song that has political content, then hopefully that song is a good enough song to make it onto <b>my</b> <b>record.</b> And if it's not, then that's just a song that I've written. So I don't think it necessarily needs to be that you're definitively trying to make a political statement."

500|$|... "People were {{literally}} scared of <b>my</b> <b>records.</b> There {{have been so}} many rumors about me and <b>my</b> <b>records.</b> People got the first album, and they would just make up stories. They'd get into an accident and be like, 'I got into an accident because I was playing that tape.' It wasn't like we helped ourselves when we described what was in people's heads. It wasn't to shock people, though, but to get people involved in what we were doing. We had to get peoples' attention. [...] We said {{a lot of things that}} people wanted to say but didn't say. We talked about a lot of political and social [...] that people didn't want to talk about." ...|$|R
500|$|Beyoncé {{said that}} she had trouble convincing {{executives}} at Columbia Records to release the album. The singer recounted that it almost was not released: [...] "In 2003, I had my first solo album. But when I played it through for <b>my</b> <b>record</b> label, they told me I didn't have one hit on my album. I guess they were kinda right, I had five. [...] "Dangerously in Love", [...] "Naughty Girl", [...] "Me, Myself and I", [...] "Baby Boy" [...] and [...] "Crazy in Love"." [...] Since [...] "Dilemma" [...] was concurrently charting atop the Billboard Hot 100, Beyoncé's management released, [...] "Work It Out", one of the songs on the soundtrack to Austin Powers in Goldmember, instead of a single from Dangerously in Love to preclude it from possibly competing with the former.|$|E

In a 2006 interview with Trax magazine, Anggun admitted to experiencing [...] "culture shock" [...] and having some serious financial problems while trying to start her new life in Europe, saying [...] "I thought the money that I got by selling <b>my</b> <b>record</b> company was enough , but I began to lose money, little by little. I had to spend so much on taking cabs and eating! So I ended up taking buses everywhere and going to clubs to introduce myself as a singer."

500|$|Rossen {{was already}} ill {{when he started}} on his final film, Lilith (1964), and it was poorly {{received}} in the United States. After it Rossen lost interest in directing, reportedly because of conflicts with the film's star, Warren Beatty. The filmmaker said, [...] "It isn't worth that kind of grief. I won't take it any more. I {{have nothing to say}} on the screen right now. Even if I never make another picture, I've got The Hustler on <b>my</b> <b>record.</b> I'm content to let that one stand for me." [...] However, {{at the time of his}} death Rossen was planning Cocoa Beach, a script he conceived in 1962, showing the hopes and struggles of transients in a local community and contrasting this with nearby Cape Canaveral, which Neve described as a [...] "symbol of America's imperial reach".|$|E

500|$|Originally, [...] "Castle Walls" [...] {{belonged to}} Diddy, who had {{commissioned}} the song for his fifth album Last Train to Paris with his group Dirty Money. But Diddy told T.I., [...] "Yeah, this is <b>my</b> <b>record,</b> {{but you know}} what, I {{think this is a}} better fit for you. I think you should rock out on this one. I think this speaks volumes to where you are, what you going through, what you living and how you feel." [...] Consequently, Christina Aguilera was chosen as the featured guest on the song, which appeared on T.I.'s album No Mercy. Alex da Kid, producer of the song, said about the collaboration, [...] "I love it. I think it's amazing. It's my sound, just kind of an evolution of that. I think it'll cater to a lot of different people." [...] T.I. told RapFix Live about the track's inspiration: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Since U Been Gone" [...] was {{the last}} track that Clarkson {{recorded}} for Breakaway; it was recorded in Sweden. At first, Clarkson was not fully convinced {{at the prospect of}} recording the song saying, [...] "It didn't have any lyrics and the melody really wasn't finalized ... the track was done on a computer, there was no band on it. <b>My</b> <b>record</b> label was freaking out about it and I was, like, why?" [...] Clarkson also explained that when she first heard [...] "Since U Been Gone", she felt that it sounded a little bit pop for her direction and she decided to tweak the song musically by incorporating drums and guitars. Clarkson told MTV that the song is about a relationship turned sour although it was going well at the very beginning. The song was officially released to mainstream radio stations in the United States on November 16, 2004 as the lead single of Breakaway.|$|E
500|$|On {{the vinyl}} and {{cassette}} pressings of Illmatic, Nas replaces the traditional Side A and Side B division with [...] "40th Side North" [...] and “41st Side South,” respectively – the main streets {{that form the}} geographic boundaries that divide the Queensbridge housing projects. Professor Sohail Daulatzai views this labeling as significant, since it transforms Illmatic into [...] "a sonic map." [...] The album serves as the legend for Nas’s ghetto cartography, as he narrates his experiences and {{those who live in}} the Queensbridge” [...] In a 2009 interview with XXL, Nas discussed the purpose behind the album artwork among other promotional efforts, stating [...] "Really the record had to represent everything Nasir Jones is about from beginning to end, from my album cover to my videos. <b>My</b> <b>record</b> company had to beg me to stop filmin' music videos in the projects. No matter what the song was about I had 'em out there. That's {{what it was all about}} for me, being that kid from the projects, being a poster child for that, that didn’t exist back then." ...|$|E
