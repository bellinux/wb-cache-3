5|$|Dot {{moves in}} with fellow senior citizen Lilly <b>Mattock</b> (Barbara Keogh) and is arrested for the illegal use of cannabis, which she confuses for herbal tea. When Lilly leaves after she is mugged, Dot moves in with Pauline. Her oldest friend Ethel also comes {{to stay with}} the Fowlers for a time, having become terminally ill. Ethel begs Dot to help her end her life. Torn between her Christian beliefs against {{euthanasia}} and her best friend's wishes, she helps Ethel to die, but later feels she should be jailed for murder. When the police do not believe her story, Dot demands retribution in another form and she ends up in court for shoplifting. She initially avoids a prison sentence but is sent down for 14 days for contempt of court following an outburst in the courtroom.|$|E
5|$|In 1973 a jadeitite axehead {{was found}} {{alongside}} the track; {{it is thought}} to have been placed there as an offering. One of over 100similar axe heads found in Britain and Ireland, its good condition and its precious material suggest that it was a symbolic axe, rather than one used to cut wood. Because of the difficulty of working this material, which was derived from the Alpine area of Europe, all the axe heads of this type found in Great Britain are thought to have been non-utilitarian and to have represented some form of currency or be the products of gift exchange. Radiocarbon dating of the peat in which the axe head was discovered suggests that it was deposited in about 3200 BC. Wooden artefacts found at the site include paddles, a dish, arrow shafts, parts of four hazel bows, a throwing axe, yew pins, digging sticks, a <b>mattock,</b> a comb, toggles, and a spoon fragment. Finds made from other materials, such as flint flakes, arrowheads, and a chipped flint axe (in mint condition) have also been made.|$|E
25|$|After initial {{plans to}} use drummers from The Weather Prophets and Thee Hypnotics for the {{recording}} of Playing With Fire, a permanent drummer was recruited in late August: Jonny <b>Mattock.</b> Despite this he does not appear on Playing With Fire – a drum machine was used {{on all of the}} songs and no drummer is credited on the album. <b>Mattock</b> had been playing in a Northampton band called 'The Apple Creation'. He was recommended by future Spacemen 3 guitarist Mark Refoy. <b>Mattock</b> made his live debut on 24 August at a gig at the Riverside in Hammersmith, London, and contributed to the new album.

25|$|On 14 November 1989, {{the four}} {{remaining}} Spacemen 3 band members met to discuss finishing the album and arranging future live dates. The meeting was unproductive. Reportedly, Kember and Pierce both said little. Jonny <b>Mattock</b> told Kember he {{was difficult to}} work with. <b>Mattock</b> and Mark Refoy, both peeved, left the meeting prematurely and effectively resigned from Spacemen 3. In December, Gerald Palmer attempted to mediate between his business partners, Kember and Pierce, meeting them individually because Pierce reportedly refused contact with Kember.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mattock</b> turned {{herself in}} to police in September 2014 {{on charges of}} using the {{proceeds}} of crime to achieve her $250,000 bail.

25|$|Entrenching tools: Carried by legionaries to {{construct}} fortifications and dig latrines etc. Each legionary would typically carry either a shovel (batillum) or dolabra (<b>mattock)</b> for digging, a turf cutting tool or a wicker basket for hauling earth.|$|E
25|$|As {{a simple}} but {{effective}} tool, mattocks have a long history. Their shape was already established by the Bronze Age in Asia Minor and ancient Greece. According to Sumerian mythology, the <b>mattock</b> was invented by the god Enlil.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eastern}} United States, the shafts of {{mattocks}} are often {{fitted with a}} screw below the head and parallel with it to secure the head from slipping down the shaft, but in the western United States, where tools are more commonly dismantled for transport, this is rarely done. When made to be dismantled, the shaft of a <b>mattock</b> fits into the oval eye of the head, and is fixed by striking the head end of the shaft against a solid surface, such as a tree stump, rock, or firm ground. The head end of the shaft is tapered outwards, and the oval opening of the iron head is similarly tapered so that the head will not fly off when used. The <b>mattock</b> head ought never be raised higher than the user's hands, {{so that it will}} not slide down and hit the user's hands. The <b>mattock</b> is meant for swinging between the user's legs, as in digging a ditch with one foot on either side. Tapping the handle end of the shaft while holding the head allows the handle to slide down and be removed.|$|E

25|$|In December, {{the three}} met to arrange signing the Dedicated record deal. Pierce insisted that Kember sign an {{agreement}} stating {{that the two of}} them had equal rights to Spacemen 3, to mutually protect them by preventing either party potentially claiming ownership of the Spacemen 3 name should the other quit. Coerced by the attraction of his portion of the Dedicated advance, Kember signed it. <b>Mattock</b> claims Kember attacked Pierce in the street the next morning. At the beginning of 1990, Kember and Pierce attended the London offices of Dedicated separately to sign the record contract. A few days later, at a dinner (at the Paper Tiger Chinese restaurant in Lutterworth, Leicestershire) with Dedicated executives, Kember and Pierce were cordial with the other guests but didn't talk with one another. The pretence was kept up until the end; Palmer did not inform Dedicated about the band breaking up until March.|$|E
25|$|Porter and {{his wife}} (<b>Mattock)</b> opposed {{extradition}} from Panama to Canada. Porter was claiming diplomatic immunity {{on the basis that}} he was travelling via Panama on a diplomatic mission to Antigua and Barbuda, on behalf of the government of Sierra Leone, according to his lawyer Ricardo Bilonick Paredes (formerly known as Ricardo Bilonick), a convicted drug smuggler with ties to Panama's former dictator, Manuel Noriega and Colombian cartels. However, the Sierra Leone government said that he was a goodwill ambassador and thus had no diplomatic immunity. On June 4, 2015, while Porter was still in La Joya jail fighting extradition to Canada, he set up a company, BQ Holding {{with the help of his}} lawyer, Ricardo Bilonick Paredes, who was listed as president. Bilonick Paredes passed millions of dollars in bribes to deposed Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega in the 1980s in exchange for the ability to fly planes packed with tons of cocaine from Panama to the United States. Bilonick netted $47 million for providing drug smuggling and money laundering services over a four-year period.|$|E
25|$|Josie {{arrives in}} Albert Square in August 1998 {{to visit her}} son, Mick McFarlane (Sylvester Williams) whom she {{believes}} {{to be a successful}} musician. However, Mick's music career failed and he has ended up selling CD's on a market stall in the Square, as well as running the Bridge Street café's night bistro. Josie, who has high aspirations for herself and her family, is not pleased to find out that her son has been lying about his professional status, but Josie also harbours a few secrets of her own. Josie's husband recently died, but before his death he was defrauded in a Jamaican property scam, leaving Josie bankrupt. Josie fosters a young girl named Kim (Krystle Williams), whom she claims is a distant relative of Mick's. Kim is the illegitimate daughter of her philandering husband, and after her mother's death, Josie kindly took her in instead of seeing her go into care. When Mick is finally made privy to this information he is extremely shocked and even more surprised to find out that both Josie and Kim plan to stay in Walford instead of returning to Jamaica. Despite his initial misgivings, Mick soon welcomes his mother and new sister into his home. Josie and Kim later move into number 3c Albert Square, where Josie becomes friendly with her downstairs neighbours, Dot Cotton (June Brown) and Lilly <b>Mattock</b> (Barbara Keogh), although Josie and Dot bicker constantly.|$|E
