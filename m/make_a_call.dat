5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Liz Friedlander and debuted on MTV's Total Request Live on March 7, 2000. It consists of performance footage of the trio in a warehouse {{in front of a}} wall decorated with photographs. In between verses, the photos' origins are explored through the different perspectives of individuals near the band. As the band prepares to play a show, a man has a conversation with a girl and is subsequently left alone. In another, while DeLonge and Hoppus read magazines inside a late-night convenience store, a melancholy woman attempts to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> via a pay phone. Other montages show the trio in the company of friends and practicing, a man looking out upon the sea, and a solitary man deserted by others at an outdoor restaurant. The final montage consists of personal photos from the band's past.|$|E
5|$|The volume, pitch, tempo {{and order}} of notes {{can be changed}} {{depending}} on the message the Australian raven intends to convey. There {{are a variety of}} contact calls: a pair often makes a low murmuring sound when preening each other while roosting, and members of a flock carry on with a quiet chattering while at rest. Birds <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> and answer sequence if temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging. Birds in flocks make a single high-pitched caa while flying over another territory as a transit call to signify they are just passing through. An Australian raven will give a longer caa with a downward inflexion to signify its return to the nest to its mate.|$|E
5|$|Committee {{inquiries}} typically {{begin with}} the reference of an issue or a proposed law to the committee for inquiry and report back to the Senate. The committee will <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> for submissions, seeking public input on the matter referred to the committee. It will often publish those submissions to help inform stakeholders of the views that are being put to the committee. A committee will often hold one or more public hearings, at which committee members ask questions of key stakeholders interested in the issue under inquiry. These hearings may be held anywhere in Australia, are often broadcast, and result in a published transcript (Hansard) that records the evidence taken. The opportunity to make submissions, and the greater accessibility of the committees compared to parliament itself, can provide disadvantaged individuals and organisations valued opportunities to engage in democratic processes. Committees also frequently ask relevant government agencies to respond to issues raised by submissions or evidence given to the inquiry. Once evidence has been gathered there usually follows a period of research and analysis by the committee. It will then deliver {{a report to the}} Senate, which will generally include recommendations. The Commonwealth government is then expected to table a response to the report, stating responses to any recommendations the committee may have made.|$|E

He and athletic director Lew Perkins issued public apologies the day after the incident.|$|E
25|$|This {{approximation}} {{is sometimes}} {{known as the}} law of rare events, since each of the n individual Bernoulli events rarely occurs. The name may be misleading because the total count of success events in a Poisson process need not be rare if the parameter np is not small. For example, the number of telephone calls to a busy switchboard in one hour follows a Poisson distribution with the events appearing frequent to the operator, but they are rare {{from the point of}} view of the average member of the population who is very unlikely to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> to that switchboard in that hour.|$|E

2500|$|A {{key play}} {{occurred}} in the following Game 5 which changed {{the outcome of the}} series. With 2.1 seconds left in the fourth quarter, the Knicks' Hubert Davis attempted a 23-foot shot which was defended by Pippen, who was called for a personal foul by referee Hue Hollins, who determined that Pippen made contact with Davis. Television replays indicated that contact was made after Davis had released the ball. Davis successfully made both free throw attempts to assist in the Knicks victory, 87–86, and gave the Knicks a three games to two advantage in the series. the resulting incident was described as the most controversial moment of Hollins' career by Referee magazine. Hollins defended the call after the game saying, [...] "I saw Scottie make contact with his shooting motion. I'm positive there was contact on the shot." [...] Darell Garretson, the league's supervisor of officials and who also officiated in the league, agreed with Hollins and issued a statement, [...] "The perception is that referees should put their whistles in their pockets in the last minutes. But {{it all comes down to}} what is sufficient contact. There's an old, old adage that refs don't make those calls in the last seconds. Obviously, you hope you don't <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> that will decide a game. But the call was within the context of how we had been calling them all game." [...] Garretson later changed his stance of the call the next season. Speaking to a Chicago Tribune reporter, Garretson described Hollins' call as [...] "terrible". Chicago head coach Phil Jackson, upset over the outcome of the game, was fined $10,000 for comparing the loss to the gold medal game controversy at the 1972 Summer Olympics.|$|E
