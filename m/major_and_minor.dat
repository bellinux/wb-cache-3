5|$|Chord {{inversion}} {{is especially}} simple in major-thirds tuning. Chords are inverted simply by raising {{one or two}} notes three strings. The raised notes are played with the same finger as the original notes. Thus, <b>major</b> <b>and</b> <b>minor</b> chords are played on two frets in M3tuning {{even when they are}} inverted. In contrast, inversions of chords in standard tuning require three fingers on a span of four frets, in standard tuning, the shape of inversions depends on the involvement of the irregular major-third.|$|E
5|$|In the {{interests}} of accuracy, Heyer once purchased a letter written by the Duke of Wellington {{so that she could}} precisely employ his style of writing. She claimed that every word attributed to Wellington in An Infamous Army was actually spoken or written by him in real life. Her knowledge of the period was so extensive that Heyer rarely mentioned dates explicitly in her books; instead, she situated the story by casually referring to <b>major</b> <b>and</b> <b>minor</b> events of the time.|$|E
5|$|Only two {{or three}} frets are needed for the guitarchords—major, minor, and {{dominant}} sevenths—which are emphasized in introductions to guitar-playing and to the fundamentals of music. Each <b>major</b> <b>and</b> <b>minor</b> chord can be played on two successive frets on three successive strings, and therefore each needs only two fingers. Other chords—seconds, fourths, sevenths, and ninths—are played on only three successive frets. For fundamental-chord fingerings, major-thirds tuning's simplicity and consistency are not shared by standard tuning, whose seventh-chord fingering is discussed {{at the end of}} this section.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} of the minuet (in F-sharp major) and the trio (in F-sharp minor) continues the overall tension between <b>major</b> <b>and</b> <b>minor.</b> The minuet features a startling harmonic shift: its second half is suddenly interrupted by a fortissimo D-major chord, far remote from the home key, before a chromatic passage leads back to the dominant of C-sharp major. The trio {{is linked to the}} minuet by the rhythmic similarities of their opening motifs.|$|E
5|$|Jesus is {{the central}} figure of Christianity. Although Christian views of Jesus vary, it is {{possible}} to summarize the key beliefs shared among major denominations, as stated in their catechetical or confessional texts. Christian views of Jesus are derived from various sources, including the canonical gospels and New Testament letters such as the Pauline epistles and the Johannine writings. These documents outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his divinity, humanity, and earthly life, and that he is the Christ and the Son of God. Despite their many shared beliefs, not all Christian denominations agree on all doctrines, and both <b>major</b> <b>and</b> <b>minor</b> differences on teachings and beliefs have persisted throughout Christianity for centuries.|$|E
5|$|Petit Ferret {{developed}} Popotan in 2002. Seki Hayabusa and Iwashinichi Shimizu handled scenario development, and Akio Watanabe designed its characters {{while working}} under the alias Poyoyon♥Rock. Higuchi Hideki and Kajihara Masahiro composed music for the series; Under17 contributed theme music with vocals. Petite Ferret created over 1,000 two-dimensional computer graphics for backgrounds, events, and character poses. Though only characters' mouths and eyes are animated, numerous poses exist for both <b>major</b> <b>and</b> <b>minor</b> characters; Petit Ferret created slightly fewer graphics for the latter to reduce production costs. The game uses a character placement system to display the characters relative to the protagonist; distant characters appear small, and grow larger as the player approaches them.|$|E

5|$|A {{thorough}} stylistic {{analysis of}} the ornamentation of the monument, in particular of the figures within the circles of the Battle scene and the Scene of sacrifice reveal a surprising sensitivity to bronze {{on the part of}} Cairano, and considerable scope for reinterpretation and commingling of styles. This stemmed from a sensible response to {{the context in which the}} mausoleum was designed and implemented. Unprecedented in Brescia was the combination of bronze and stone, the former under the supervision of Bernardino delle Croci who certainly had a vast catalogue of references to ancient and contemporary works, all of which are cited in the <b>major</b> <b>and</b> <b>minor</b> rounds on the base. It is difficult to exclude Cairano from the influence of so much classicism, but the sole Scene of sacrifice attests to the sophistication of his chisel and the innovative combination of sculpture and bronzes around 1510, to which date much of the remaining lapidary apparatus can also be placed.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to heavy}} rainfall, {{widespread}} flooding was reported, {{especially in the}} central and western portions of the county. Whole neighborhoods in The Acreage, Loxahatchee, Royal Palm Beach, and Wellington were left stranded for up to several days. In some areas, flooding was considered the worst since Hurricane Irene in 1999. At the post office in Loxahatchee, {{the parking lot was}} flooded, forcing the building to close for several days. A major washout was reported in West Palm Beach at the intersection of State Roads 80 and 882. Also in West Palm Beach, a road collapsed and fire rescue crews quickly closed the road. On State Road 704, a portion of it became inaccessible to low-clearance vehicles. A man died in West Palm Beach after driving through the storm and crashing into a concrete wall along Interstate 95. Several <b>major</b> <b>and</b> <b>minor</b> roads were also inundated by water in Wellington. Additionally, there was flooding at the intersections of Meadow Avenue and Greenview Shores Boulevard, and Indian Mound Road and South Shore Boulevard. Heavy rainfall left several leaking roofs at an apartment complex in Pahokee.|$|E
5|$|Hancock and the Democrats {{expected}} {{to carry the}} Solid South, {{while much of the}} North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans; most of the campaign would involve a handful of close states, including New York {{and a few of the}} Midwestern states (national elections in that era were largely decided by closely divided states there). Practical differences between the major party candidates were few, and Republicans began the campaign with the familiar theme of waving the bloody shirt: reminding Northern voters that the Democratic Party was responsible for secession and four years of civil war, and that if they held power they would reverse the gains of that war, dishonor Union veterans, and pay Confederate soldiers' pensions out of the federal treasury. With fifteen years having passed since the end of the war, and Union generals at the head of all of the <b>major</b> <b>and</b> <b>minor</b> party tickets, the appeal to wartime loyalties was of diminishing value in exciting the voters.|$|E

5|$|The Phra Thinang Chakri Maha Prasat {{buildings}} {{are composed of}} nine <b>major</b> <b>and</b> <b>minor</b> halls, structured in a similar scheme to the Maha Monthien Halls from north to south, however the two building groups contrasts greatly in styles. This group of palaces is situated at the centre, between the Maha Montein and Maha Prasat groups. The whole of the Chakri Maha Prasat group {{was the work of}} King Rama V and foreign architects in the 19th century. During the reign of King Rama I the area was once an expansive garden, later named Suan Sai (สวนซ้าย) or 'Left Garden', the twin of Suan Khwa (สวนขวา) or right garden, now the Siwalai Gardens. The two gardens were named according to their location on {{the left and the right}} of the Maha Monthien buildings. During the reign of King Rama III a new residential pavilion called Phra Tamnak Tuek (พระตำหนักตึก) was constructed for his mother, Princess Mother Sri Sulalai. The new residence was composed of several low-lying buildings and pavilions. King Rama IV expanded the residence and gave it to his consort Queen Debsirindra. Within these buildings King Rama V was born (in 1853) and lived as a child.|$|E
5|$|Twin helical strands {{form the}} DNA backbone. Another double helix {{may be found}} tracing the spaces, or grooves, between the strands. These voids are {{adjacent}} to the base pairs and may provide a binding site. As the strands are not symmetrically located with respect to each other, the grooves are unequally sized. One groove, the major groove, is 22Å wide and the other, the minor groove, is 12Å wide. The width of the major groove means that {{the edges of the}} bases are more accessible in the major groove than in the minor groove. As a result, proteins such as transcription factors that can bind to specific sequences in double-stranded DNA usually make contact with the sides of the bases exposed in the major groove. This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell (see below), but the <b>major</b> <b>and</b> <b>minor</b> grooves are always named to reflect the differences in size that would be seen if the DNA is twisted back into the ordinary B form.|$|E
5|$|More {{problematic}} {{are those}} {{cases where the}} movement of the Sun at different times and seasons causes light and shadow interactions with petroglyphs. A widely known example is the Sun Dagger of Fajada Butte at which a glint of sunlight passes over a spiral petroglyph. The location of a dagger of light on the petroglyph varies throughout the year. At the summer solstice a dagger can be seen through the heart of the spiral; at the winter solstice two daggers appear to either side of it. It is proposed that this petroglyph was created to mark these events. Recent studies have identified many similar sites in the US Southwest and Northwestern Mexico. It has been argued that the number of solstitial markers at these sites provides statistical evidence that they were intended to mark the solstices. The Sun Dagger site on Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, stands out for its explicit light markings that record all the key events of both the solar and lunar cycles: summer solstice, winter solstice, equinox, and the <b>major</b> <b>and</b> <b>minor</b> lunar standstills of the moon’s 18.6 year cycle. In addition at two other sites on Fajada Butte, there are five light markings on petroglyphs recording the summer and winter solstices, equinox and solar noon. Numerous buildings and interbuilding alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon and outlying areas are oriented to the same solar and lunar directions that are marked at the Sun Dagger site.|$|E
