For the recordings a <b>mobile</b> <b>trolley</b> with the necessary equipment was constructed for use in an examination room or in an operating theatre environment. Laser light was guided through a 600 m optical fibre to the target tissue. The fluorescence from the excited tissue was collected with the same fibre and was fed to an optical multichannel analyser. Two excitation wavelengths were used (337 and 405 nm) in order to optimize the fluorescence signals in two interesting wavelength regions (380 – 500 and 550 – 700 nm). Oral and oropharyngeal tumours excited with 405 nm light contained detectable endogenous porphyrins and were in this way discriminated from the normal mucosa.

40|$|Objectives: The aims of {{this study}} were to assess parents’ views of {{immediate}} neonatal care and resuscitation at birth being provided beside the mother, and their experiences of a <b>mobile</b> <b>trolley</b> designed to facilitate this bedside care. Design: Qualitative study with semistructured interviews. Results were analysed using thematic analysis. Setting: Large UK maternity hospital. Participants: Mothers whose baby received initial neonatal care in the first few minutes of life at the bedside, and their birth partners, were eligible. 30 participants were interviewed (19 mothers, 10 partners and 1 grandmother). 5 babies required advanced neonatal resuscitation. Results: 5 themes were identified: (1) Reassurance, which included ‘Baby is OK’, ‘Having baby close’, ‘Confidence in care’, ‘Knowing what's going on’ and ‘Dad as informant’; (2) Involvement of the family, which included ‘Opportunity for contact’, ‘Family involvement’ and ‘Normality’; (3) Staff communication, which included ‘Communication’ and ‘Experience’; (4) Reservations, which included ‘Reservations about witnessing resuscitation’, ‘Negative emotions’ and ‘Worries about the impact on staff’ and (5) Experiences of the trolley, which included ‘Practical issues’ and ‘Comparisons with standard resuscitation equipment’. Conclusions: Families were positive about neonatal care being provided at the bedside, and felt it gave reassurance about their baby's health and care.

Design: Qualitative interview study with semistructured interviews. Results: The results were analysed using thematic analysis. Setting: A large UK maternity unit. Participants: Clinicians (n= 20) from a range of disciplines who were present when the trolley was used to provide neonatal care at birth at the bedside. Five clinicians provided/observed advanced resuscitation by the bedside. Results: Five themes were identified: (1) Parents’ involvement, which included ‘Contact and involvement’, ‘Positive emotions for parents’ and ‘Staff communication’; (2) Reservations about neonatal care at birth beside the mother, which included ‘Impact on clinicians’ and ‘Impact on parents’; (3) Practical challenges in providing neonatal care at the bedside, which included ‘Cord length’ and ‘Caesarean section’; (4) Comparison of the trolley with usual resuscitation equipment and (5) Training and integration of bedside care into clinical routine, which included ‘Teething problems’ and ‘Training’.

They are typically comprised of open cubicle areas without solid walls, occupied by <b>mobile</b> <b>trolleys</b> rather than beds and in close proximity to one another and to staff. This design reflects the traditional prioritisa-tion of ease of access in emergency situations, sustaining life and minimising morbidity [1] over privacy, comfort and a quiet environment. A mismatch appears to have de-veloped between the function of EDs, with their disparate modern mandates, and their form or environment created by the traditional physical design which is geared more to-ward managing those with acute illness and injury than those with chronic conditions. ED clinicians are increasingly playing a pivotal role in managing complications of chronic disease, end-of-life care (EOLC) [2, 3] and the sequelae of events that pre-cipitate death [4 - 6]. This is particularly apparent in the context of advanced cancer. With the increasing preva-lence of cancer [7], some have suggested that there is...|$|R

40|$|In many countries, {{regionalisation}} is recognised {{as being}} {{the most effective and}} efficient way of providing specialised perinatal care. In such a model, high-risk infants are transported in utero to allow delivery at a centre where an appropriate level of care may be provided to the mother and to the infant. However, not all births are predictable and some infants are unavoidably born away from the level of care that they need. For these infants, any delay in transportation to a specialist centre may have significant implications for their outcome. In Queensland, the setting for the work described in this thesis, the highly distributed population and long distances impede access to specialist perinatal care and lead to lengthy infant retrieval missions. Real-time telemedicine may be an effective way of connecting specialists in tertiary intensive care nurseries with clinicians in referring hospitals. Specifically, it may allow earlier review of an infant by a specialist than would otherwise be possible. During a telemedicine consultation, the infant, X-rays and patient monitors can be remotely visualised by a specialist. This may allow for early intervention or appropriate modification to infant management prior to infant retrieval. In some cases, it may be that in some infant retrieval may be avoided. While telemedicine has been shown to have potential in other areas of neonatal care, no formal studies regarding teleconsultation for infant retrieval management {{have been reported in the}} literature. The aim of this thesis was to explore the potential of telemedicine for remote neonatal consultation in Queensland. In the absence of a suitable commercially available product, a custom neonatal telemedicine system was designed and developed to support the process of remote neonatal clinical consultation between a tertiary perinatal centre and referring hospitals. The telemedicine system was developed with a senior neonatologist through a process of iterative refinement. The system comprised two parts: a <b>mobile,</b> wireless <b>trolley</b> containing camera equipment and a microphone which was placed adjacent to the infant, and a personal computer based console which allowed remote control of the cameras and a number of functions to support clinical consultation. Following the development work, a number of studies were designed to examine the feasibility, efficacy, preliminary effectiveness, economics and the acceptability of telemedicine for remote neonatal consultation. The feasibility and efficacy of telemedicine facilitated neonatal assessments was established using a method-comparison study which was conducted in the controlled environment of a neonatal intensive care nursery. In this study, telemedicine assessments of infants and other clinically relevant visual information such as X-rays, views of patient monitors and ventilators were compared with simultaneous in-person assessments. While there was a high level of overall agreement between assessment methods, the study highlighted that some tasks, such as assessment of respiratory rate by observation, were difficult to conduct by telemedicine. To provide a preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of teleconsultation in routine clinical use, a multi-centre observational study was designed. The 12 month study, involving four referring nurseries and a tertiary perinatal facility, found that the visual information provided by telemedicine made an important contribution to management decisions and could lead to some infant retrievals being avoided. Independent expert review found that in 93 % of cases telemedicine provided new clinical information and in 14 % of cases a change of management was agreed. In 33 % of cases there was a change in transport decision and in 26 % of cases retrieval was avoided. Using these results, the economics of neonatal teleconsultation was modelled. The results clearly demonstrated that telemedicine can offer significant savings to the health system through the avoidance of transport. While the use of telemedicine was lower than predicted during the study period, the transport costs which were avoided through its use (AUD $ 102, 338) significantly outweighed the total cost of providing telemedicine (AUD $ 45, 686) yielding a saving of AUD $ 56, 652. A further projection showed that savings could have been achieved with an avoidance rate of only 5 % if telemedicine had been used to manage all retrievals for the four referring hospital in the 12 month period. Finally, in order to assess the acceptability of telemedicine as a mode of consultation in the context of neonatal care, clinicians who had been involved in the multicentre trial were surveyed. Overall acceptance of telemedicine was high with no significant differences between tertiary and peripheral clinician opinions. Some clinicians indicated that they perceived telemedicine to be too time consuming or that it offered no advantage over the telephone. Further work is required to determine whether these perceptions may be overcome. The work described in this thesis has demonstrated that telemedicine is a feasible and efficacious tool for assessing infants remotely. It has also provided preliminary evidence that telemedicine is an effective means of supporting the care of newborn infants who have been delivered remote from a tertiary perinatal facility. Further, this research has demonstrated that economic benefit may accrue through the avoidance of infant transport and that the use of telemedicine is generally acceptable to clinicians involved in providing neonatal care...|$|R
