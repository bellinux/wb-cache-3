40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{characterisation}} of receiving <b>mutual</b> <b>impedances</b> of compact arrays with omnidirectional antenna elements is proposed. Based {{on a large}} number of incident waves coming from different directions, the new method is able to calculate the receiving <b>mutual</b> <b>impedances</b> of omni-directional antennas based on a system of equations that characterise the received terminal voltages at different incident wave directions. In the new method, the receiving <b>mutual</b> <b>impedances</b> of all the antenna elements are calculated together in a single equation with the scattering effect from all antenna elements in the array being taken into account. Compared to the previous methods for the characterisation of the receiving <b>mutual</b> <b>impedances,</b> the new method preserves the boundary conditions of the original electromagnetic problem and produces much more accurate results on receiving <b>mutual</b> <b>impedances,</b> especially for compact antenna arrays.

30|$|In [7], {{it shows}} that the {{variation}} of the receiving <b>mutual</b> <b>impedances</b> with elevation angle is a process of gradual change. It means that the receiving <b>mutual</b> <b>impedances</b> do not vary with elevation angle significantly. The simulation results in [6, 7] have shown that estimating the elevation angle with single-elevation-angle receiving-mutual-impedance could achieve error accuracy around 1 °. Therefore, it is feasible to estimate the elevation angle using mutual coupling compensated with single-elevation-angle receiving-mutual-impedance. We will estimate an initial elevation angle using the MCM obtained at θ = 45 ° first. Then we can get a more accurate result with the MCM obtained at the initial estimate.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a full-wave semi-analytical {{solution}} {{of self and}} <b>mutual</b> <b>impedances</b> for a coil-based system is proposed. It consists of two concentric circular coils with rectangular cross sections. Traditionally, the calculation of self and <b>mutual</b> <b>impedances</b> of these coils are based on eddy current approxima-tion, where a simple background is assumed to achieve analytical and semi-analytical solutions. As the system operates at higher frequencies and with inhomogeneous media, the displacement current {{has to be taken}} into account. By deriving Maxwell’s equations without eddy current assumption, the impedances of coils immersed in the layered medium can be obtained analytically. The results show a considerable discrepancy at sub-GHz frequencies, indicating the significant effect of displacement current at higher frequencies for a coil-based wireless power transfer link.

50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common and general such theorem is Lorentz {{reciprocity}} (and its various special cases such as Rayleigh-Carson reciprocity), named after work by Hendrik Lorentz in 1896 following analogous results regarding sound by Lord Rayleigh and light by Helmholtz (Potton, 2004). Loosely, it states that the relationship between an oscillating current and the resulting electric field is unchanged if one interchanges the points where the current is placed and where the field is measured. For the specific case of an electrical network, it is sometimes phrased as the statement that voltages and currents at different points in the network can be interchanged. More technically, it follows that the <b>mutual</b> <b>impedance</b> of a first circuit due to a second {{is the same as the}} <b>mutual</b> <b>impedance</b> of the second circuit due to the first.|$|E

40|$|In antenna arrays, mutual {{coupling}} between antenna elements {{is well known}} as an undesired effect, which degrades the performance of array signal-processing algorithms. The compensation of such an undesired effect has been a popular research topic throughout the years.

In general, the mutual-coupling problems for a transmitting and receiving array are different, even if the physical geometry of the array remains unchanged.
