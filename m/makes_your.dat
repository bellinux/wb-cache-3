5|$|Later in the game, non-rotatable gems can be found, and {{the player}} is punished for {{rotations}} {{that do not}} lead to a match by having the enemy's gauge fill faster. The amount of damage that the player can take or deliver is dependent on the monster used in battle, and using a beast in battle earns experience points which can increase the power of that summon. Each monster has a corresponding color, and matching gems that are the same color as your chosen monster or the enemy <b>makes</b> <b>your</b> gauge fill faster or theirs slower. Enemy monsters can change gems on the board to skulls, which cause damage to the player if they are not lined up within a certain number of moves. After being defeated in a battle, enemy monsters are added to the list of creatures that the player chooses from when they start a stage. New monsters can also be found hidden in the stages, along with items that can be used during battles.|$|E

500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] is an R and pop love song, composed {{in the key}} of D-minor and F-major. It incorporates 1970s-style funk, hip hop, and contains influences of soul. As commented by Robert Webb of The Independent, the old soul influences in the song {{seem to have been}} derived from the horn hook, which samples the 1970 song [...] "Are You My Woman? (Tell Me So)." [...] Having a go-go vibe, [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] is built on a hip hop beat. Beyoncé told The Sunday Herald that the beat is [...] "so hard that it <b>makes</b> <b>your</b> heart hurt." [...] The song's tempo is a moderate 100 beats per minute, in common time. Beyoncé's vocal range spans around one and a half octaves in the song, from the low note of A3 to the high note of F5. [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] uses two major chords, B♭ and G, a minor third apart. One of the main vocal riffs uses the traditional cowbell rhythm often found in samba music. Lisa Verrico of The Times magazine, wrote that [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] makes use of big drums and bits of brass.|$|E

She revealed that after deciding {{to take a}} break, she {{spent a lot of}} time with her husband and having a simpler life away from her band, but still feeling like she was not [...] "whole". Instead, she felt lost and missed her work with the band and the writing process. Later, she decided to write the song as an apology to her fans for being gone for so long. Starting with piano and Lee's vocals, the song slowly builds, [...] "layering on stirring strings, booming timpani and, at the climax, some thunderous guitar chords" [...] as stated by James Montgomery of MTV News. He further stated that the song had similarities with the song [...] "Jóga" [...] (1997) by Icelandic recording artist Björk which Lee confirmed by saying, [...] "That's a big inspirational song for me. That's a song through my life that I've listened to a whole bunch. And to me, Björk, what makes her style are the strings, the orchestral elements, and that passion that it creates. ... It <b>makes</b> <b>your</b> heart pour out. That totally inspired me, and that song inspired me."

500|$|Greater success {{came later}} in the year when Streep starred in the drama Sophie's Choice (also 1982), portraying a Polish {{holocaust}} survivor caught in a love triangle between a young naïve writer (Peter MacNicol) and a Jewish intellectual (Kevin Kline). Streep's emotional dramatic performance and her apparent mastery of a Polish accent drew praise. William Styron wrote the novel with Ursula Andress in mind for the role of Sophie, but Streep was determined to get the role. Streep filmed the [...] "choice" [...] scene in one take and refused to do it again, finding it extremely painful and emotionally exhausting. The scene in which Streep is ordered by an SS guard at Auschwitz to choose which one of her two children would be gassed and which would proceed to the labor camp, is her most famous scene, according to Emma Brockes of The Guardian who wrote in 2006: [...] "It's classic Streep, the kind of scene that <b>makes</b> <b>your</b> scalp tighten, but defter in a way is her handling of smaller, harder-to-grasp emotions". Among several acting awards, Streep won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance, and her characterization was voted the third greatest movie performance of all time by Premiere magazine. Roger Ebert said of her delivery, [...] "Streep plays the Brooklyn scenes with an enchanting Polish-American accent (she has the first accent I've ever wanted to hug), and she plays the flashbacks in subtitled German and Polish. There is hardly an emotion that Streep doesn't touch in this movie, and yet we're never aware of her straining. This {{is one of the most}} astonishing and yet one of the most unaffected and natural performances I can imagine." [...] Pauline Kael on the contrary called the film an [...] "infuriatingly bad movie" [...] and thought that Streep [...] "decorporealizes" [...] herself, which she believed explained why her movie heroines [...] "don't seem to be full characters, and why there are no incidental joys to be had from watching her".|$|E

2500|$|Following {{his success}} with Lonely Are the Brave and , Goldsmith {{went on to}} achieve even more {{critical}} recognition with the theme music to The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (1964), and scores to such films as the 1964 western Rio Conchos, the 1964 political thriller Seven Days in May, the 1965 romantic drama A Patch of Blue, the 1965 epic war film In Harm's Way (in which Goldsmith also made a brief cameo appearance), the 1966 World War I air combat film The Blue Max, the 1966 period naval war epic The Sand Pebbles, the 1967 thriller Warning Shot, the 1967 western Hour of the Gun, and the 1968 controversial mystery The Detective. [...] His score for The Blue Max is regarded by many Goldsmith aficionados {{as one of the}} very best scores he wrote during his long and distinguished career. Interestingly, he almost didn't accept the assignment when he watched the final cut with the producers who had temp-tracked it with Richard Strauss's Also Sprach Zarathustra. He said, [...] "I admit it worked fairly well but my first reaction was to get up and walk away from the job, but I couldn't. Once you've heard music like that with the picture, it <b>makes</b> <b>your</b> own scoring more difficult to arrive at, it clouds your thinking." [...] Nonetheless, what resulted was breathtaking and the main theme captures the fear and joy of flight many times throughout the film. It is curious that films with significant sequences that involve flight inspired Goldsmith to write some of his most exhilarating music, such as in Supergirl, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, A Gathering of Eagles, Night Crossing, Air Force One and Tora! Tora! Tora!. Goldsmith's scores to A Patch of Blue and The Sand Pebbles garnered him his second and third Academy Award nominations, respectively, and were both one of the 250 nominees for the American Film Institute's top twenty-five American film scores. [...] His scores for Seven Days in May and [...] The Sand Pebbles also garnered Goldsmith his first two respective Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Original Score in 1965 and 1967. [...] During this time, he also composed for many lighter, comedic films such as the family comedy The Trouble with Angels (1966), the James Bond parodies Our Man Flint (1966) and its sequel In Like Flint (1967), and the comedy The Flim-Flam Man (1967).|$|E
