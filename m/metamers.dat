In all land plants a disc-like structure called a phragmoplast forms where the cell will divide, a trait only found in the land plants in the streptophyte lineage, some species within their relatives Coleochaetales, Charales and Zygnematales, as well as within subaerial species of the algae order Trentepohliales, {{and appears to be}} essential in the adaptation towards a terrestrial life style.|$|E

We review work both in neuroscience related to metameric stimuli, as well as computer vision research in style transfer. We propose our NeuroFovea metamer model {{that is based on}} a mixture of peripheral representations and style transfer forward-pass algorithms for any image from the recent work of Adaptive Instance Normalization (Huang & Belongie).

The main contribution {{of this paper is}} to show how metamer sets can be calculated when a device’s spectral sensitivities are not known. The result is built on two observations: first, the set of all reflectance spectra are convex combinations of certain basic colours which tend to be very bright (or dark) and have high chroma. Second, the convex combinations which describe reflectance spectra result in convex combinations of RGBs. Thus, given an rgb it is possible to find the set of convex combination of the RGBs of the basic colours which generate the same rgb.

40|$|The {{advent of}} modern {{solid-state}} sources enabled almost any spectrum for lighting {{and a wide}} range of possibilities in color rendering. The quality of the lighting has been typically evaluated by the color rendering index which measures how much the colors of objects illuminated by the light under test look similar to those produced when the objects are illuminated by the daylight or a conventional incandescent light.

We investigated, computationally, the spectral profiles of the illumination that maximizes the theoretical limit of the perceivable object colors.

40|$|A functional¿structural {{plant growth}} model {{was used to}} explore how {{selection}} might influence the ontogenetic patterns in three-dimensional (3 -D) growth of trees. The 3 -D plant structure {{is defined by the}} orientation of <b>metamers.</b> The dynamics in the 3 -D plant structure depend on the production of <b>metamers</b> and/or leaf pipes and the loss of such plant components. In the simulations, metamer and leaf-pipe traits were kept constant, so all ontogenetic changes depended on the spatial arrangement of <b>metamers</b> and/or leaf pipes. This study explores the consequences of three new assumptions for ontogenetic changes in 3 -D plant structure: (1) meristems are produced at the positions where branches fall, thus enabling a tree to maintain a viable meristem population within the crown; (2) <b>metamers</b> are placed at meristem positions in the 3 -D structure where the carbon benefit over the expected life span of a leaf pipe is maximized; (3) the carbon allocation to reproduction maximizes the long-term reproductive output. In combination with the constraints set by the morphology of metamer and leaf pipe, the carbon economy, and light conditions, these assumptions explain how selection may cause a sigmoid expansion phase and a stable steady-state phase; adaptive responses in 3 -D structure during ontogeny; limits to tree size (including height); constant allometric scaling during the expansion phase; different scaling for trees in different light environments; and responses in optimal reproductive allocation to forest light environments. These results support the idea that selection for maximizing the net carbon gain determines how trees change in 3 -D tree structure during ontogeny and, at the same time, how they acclimate in 3 -D structure in response to light gradient...|$|E

The metameric black paradigm was introduced by Wyszecki [Farbe 2, 39 (1953) ] and developed by Cohen and Kappauf [Am. J. Psychol. 95, 537 (1982) ]. Within a multireceptor and multiprimary scheme, we investigate how far the choice of illumination can isolate a photoreceptor response. The spectral profiles of the fundamental <b>metamers</b> that correspond to a collection of x;y values over the chromaticity diagram are shown. When the luminance is set at a fixed value, the relative excitation of the melanopsin cells and of the rods elicited by the fundamental <b>metamers</b> varies over the chromaticity diagram. The range of excitation of the melanopsin cells and of the rods that could be achieved at a given chromaticity, by manipulating the metameric black content, is examined. When only the melanopsin excitation is manipulated, the range of melanopsin excitation that can be achieved is rather limited. On the chromaticity diagram, the largest range of variation of the rods and the melanopsin cells excitation is obtained for x;y chromaticity coordinates near 1 ∕ 3; 1 ∕ 3 .

40|$|Light sources {{with almost}} {{arbitrary}} spectral distributions, like LED and DLP based sources, are today {{available to the}} general public but their colour rendering properties are still not well characterized. In this work we studied, computationally, the chromatic effects of a large set of illuminants with almost arbitrary spectral structure. The illuminants were <b>metamers</b> of a Planckian radiator with colour temperature of 6500 K and <b>metamers</b> of non-Planckian radiators with chromaticity coordinates uniformly distributed over the same isotemperature line. The <b>metamers</b> were generated by the Schmitt’s elements approach and were parameterized by the spectral distance to the equi-energy illuminant E. The colour rendering properties of each illuminant were quantified by the CIE colour rendering index (CRI), by a chromatic diversity index (CDI) and by the number of discernible colours estimated for a set of indoor scenes digitized by hyperspectral imaging. It was found that CRI decreases as the spectral structure of the illuminant increase and that larger values of CDI could only be obtained with illuminants with a small number of non-zero spectral bands, that is, with highly structured spectra. In conclusion, highly structured illuminants produce larger chromatic diversity than more uniform spectrum and may therefore be best for applications where maximization of chromatic diversity is important.

The first essay deals with the problem of distinguishing between plasticity and other types of ontogenetic variation. In a temporally varying environment, morphological plasticity may be expressed as the production of a succession of different <b>metamers.</b> However, even in a constant environment, plant <b>metamers</b> can vary dramatically, a phenomenon known as heteroblasty. Be-cause heteroblasty and plasticity can yield similar patterns of ontogenetic variation, the two are often confounded in analyses of developmental plasticity.

The third section shows that developmental properties can constrain the expression of morphological plasticity. Developmental lags and the ‘epiphenotype problem ’ are particularly important features for analyses of the evolution and expression of plasticity.

40|$|Very often, {{different}} results are obtained when colored originals and/or reproductions under different so-called {{standard light sources}} are evaluated. A {{possible explanation for the}} {{different results}} is that not all admissible standard sources have the same spectral power distribution, either due to differences in manufacturing or due to aging. A possible solution to the problem would be to determine how the spectral power distribution of a given illuminant differs from the standard (D 5000) distribution by visually comparing suitable metameric grays with a stable non-selective gray under the illuminant in question. This comparison would serve as a quick and inexpensive way of testing the light source. Two major questions are involved in this investigation: (1) Are the color differences obtainable with <b>metamers</b> large enough to be useful? (2) What part does the variation of color response of individual observers play in this system? The first question was investigated using two sets of metameric grays data: initially Wyszecki 2 ̆ 7 s <b>metamers</b> and systematic changes in the D 5000 power distribution; and then MacAdam 2 ̆ 7 s metameric grays based on real pigments from spectrophotometric data. The results for Wyszecki 2 ̆ 7 s <b>metamers</b> indicated that reasonable color differences occurred between non-selective gray and metameric grays with systematic changes in the spectral power distribution of the illuminant. Similar results were obtained for MacAdam 2 ̆ 7 s <b>metamers</b> but with less sensitivity, that is, there were smaller differences between the non-selective gray and the metameric grays. It was found that deviations from the D 5000 spectral composition can indeed be picked up and the method is sufficiently sensitive for the Standard Observer. The second question, the variation of individual observers, was investigated using information based on the measurements by Stiles and Burch, and also the Standard Deviate Observer determined by Eugene Allen. The investigation was done by obtaining the color differences relating to the individual observers, and comparing them to the Standard Observer when comparing the selective and non-selective grays to the standard D 5000 sources. The result of this investigation indicated that the color differences due to the variations between observers were larger than the color differences between the non- selective gray and the metameric grays due to the changes in the power distribution of the source. The conclusion is that this system of determining the changes in the spectral power distribution of the light source by the color differences between non-selective and selective metameric grays is inadequate because of the variances in individual observers...|$|E
