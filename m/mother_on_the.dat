5|$|Sigmund Freud {{may have}} been among the first to stress the {{potential}} effect of loss of the <b>mother</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> developing child, but his concern was less with the actual experience of maternal care than with the anxiety the child might feel about the loss of the nourishing breast. As little of Freud's theory was based on actual observations of infants, little effort was made to consider the effects of real experiences of loss.|$|E
5|$|In late 1108 {{or early}} 1109, Henry V, then the King of the Romans, sent envoys to Normandy proposing that Matilda marry him, and wrote {{separately}} to her <b>mother</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same matter. The match was {{attractive to the}} English King: his daughter would be marrying {{into one of the}} most prestigious dynasties in Europe, reaffirming his own, slightly questionable, status as the youngest son of a new royal house, and gaining him an ally in dealing with France. In return, Henry V would receive a dowry of 10,000 marks, which he needed to fund an expedition to Rome for his coronation as the Holy Roman Emperor. The final details of the deal were negotiated at Westminster in June 1109 and, as a result of her changing status, Matilda attended a royal council for the first time that October. She left England in February 1110 to make her way to Germany.|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} to the United States, Urey received an offer of a National Research Council fellowship to Harvard University, and also received an offer to be a research associate at Johns Hopkins University. He chose the latter. Before taking up the job, he traveled to Seattle, Washington, to visit his <b>mother.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> way, he stopped by Everett, Washington, where he knew a woman called Kate Daum. Kate introduced Urey to her sister, Frieda. Urey and Frieda soon became engaged. They were married at her father's house in Lawrence, Kansas, in 1926. The couple had four children: Gertrude Bessie (Elisabeth), born in 1927; Frieda Rebecca, born in 1929; Mary Alice, born in 1934; and John Clayton Urey, born in 1939.|$|E

5|$|Revolution {{broke out}} in St. Petersburg {{in the spring of}} 1917. At the height of the chaos, Maria and her {{siblings}} were stricken with measles. The Tsarina was reluctant to move the children to the safety of the imperial residence at Gatchina, even though she was advised to do so. Maria was the last of the five to fall ill and, while she was still healthy, was a major source of support to her mother. Maria went outside with her <b>mother</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> night of March 13, 1917 to plead with the soldiers to remain loyal to the imperial family. Shortly afterwards, the seventeen-year-old fell ill with measles and virulent pneumonia and nearly died. She was not told that her father had abdicated the throne until after she began to recover.|$|E

5|$|The term {{maternal}} deprivation is a catch-phrase summarising {{the early}} work of psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, John Bowlby {{on the effects}} of separating infants and young children from their mother (or mother substitute) although the effect of loss of the <b>mother</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> developing child had been considered earlier by Freud and other theorists. Bowlby's work on delinquent and affectionless children and the effects of hospital and institutional care led to his being commissioned to write the World Health Organisation's report on the mental health of homeless children in post-war Europe whilst he was head of the Department for Children and Parents at the Tavistock Clinic in London after World War II. The result was the monograph Maternal Care and Mental Health published in 1951, which sets out the maternal deprivation hypothesis.|$|E

40|$|Captive multi-mammate mice, Mastomys natalensis, were paired {{and kept}} on one of three {{treatment}} diets (low, medium and high protein) {{in order to assess}} differential maternal investment in the sexes, and sex-specific resource allocation of offspring. The influence of maternal dietary protein content on maternal reproductive performance, sex-specific body composition of pups and pup growth from birth to weaning was determined. <b>Mothers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> high protein diet were larger than those <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower protein diets, and produced more male than female offspring. <b>Mothers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower protein diets did not produce sex-biased litters. Maternal dietary protein intake did not significantly influence litter size or the interval between litters. Litters produced by <b>mothers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> medium (15 %) protein diet were significantly larger than those produced by <b>mothers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> low (10 %) protein diet. There were no sex-specific differences in body size or body tissue composition of pups at birth of at weaning within each treatment group. At weaning, pups in the 20 % protein treatment group had proportionately greater amounts of lean tissue and less body lipid reserves than pups in the 10 % protein treatment group. Pups in the 20 % protein treatment group were also larger, and had faster growth rates, than those in the 10 % protein treatment group. Weaned pups in the 15 % protein treatment group had the fastest growth rates and greatest energetic contents of all of the treatment groups. These results suggest that larger <b>mothers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> high (20 %) protein diet show differential investment in the sexes, not by allocating more resources to individuals of that sex, but by producing more male than female offspring. Maternal dietary protein intake did not appear to influence the reproductive output of mothers, but did affect pup mass, growth rates and body composition which would have implications for their future success and survival.

5|$|Once a room is {{cleared of}} monsters, {{it will remain}} clear, {{allowing}} the player to re-trace {{their way through the}} level, though once they move onto the next level, they cannot return. Along the way, the player can collect money to buy power-ups from shopkeepers, keys to unlock special treasure rooms, and new weapons and power-ups to strengthen their chances against the enemies. The player's health is tracked by a number of hearts; if the character loses all their hearts, the game ends in permadeath and the player must start over from a freshly-generated dungeon. Each floor of the dungeon includes a boss which the player must defeat before continuing to the next level. On the sixth of eight floors, the player fights Isaac's mother; after defeating her, Isaac crawls into her womb. Later levels are significantly harder, culminating in a fight against the heart of Isaac's <b>mother</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eighth floor. An optional ninth floor, Sheol contains the boss Satan. Winning the game with certain characters or by certain conditions unlocks new power-ups that might appear in the dungeon or the ability to use one of the other characters. The game tracks the various power-ups that the player has found over time which can be reviewed from the game's menus.|$|E

It also briefly describes the current situation of cervical cancer incidence, clinical presentation, diagnostics, treatment and consequences of the disease. The empirical part investigates the knowledge of girls and mothers with regards to this thesis by identifying and compares the information of the selected group (girls 13 - 14 and their <b>mothers)</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue of cervical cancer, risk factors of the cancer and prevention, such as vaccination and regular preventive gynaecological examinations.
