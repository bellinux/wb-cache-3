5|$|Amin retaliated {{against the}} {{attempted}} invasion by Ugandan exiles in 1972, by purging {{the army of}} Obote supporters, predominantly those from the Acholi and Lango ethnic groups. In July 1971, Lango and Acholi soldiers were massacred in the Jinja and Mbarara barracks. By early 1972, some 5,000 Acholi and Lango soldiers, and {{at least twice as}} many civilians, had disappeared. The victims soon came to include members of other ethnic groups, religious leaders, journalists, artists, senior bureaucrats, judges, lawyers, students and intellectuals, criminal suspects, and foreign nationals. In this atmosphere of violence, <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> were killed for criminal motives or simply at will. Bodies were often dumped into the River Nile.|$|E
5|$|Speakers at Payton's public funeral service, held in Soldier Field, {{included}} Jesse Jackson; then National Football League Commissioner Paul Tagliabue; {{former teammate}} Dan Hampton; his widow Connie Payton; and his children, Jarrett and Brittney. Among the 1,000 mourners at the private service were John Madden; Illinois Governor George Ryan; Chicago's mayor Richard M.

Area contractors had sent all their men to assist, and <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> came to the scene in response to the pleas for help. Eventually, 34 firefighters and the Chief of the Lansing Fire Department arrived on the scene, as did several Michigan State Police officers who managed traffic to and from the scene. The injured and dying were transported to Sparrow Hospital and St. Lawrence Hospital in Lansing. The construction of the St. Lawrence facility had been financed in large part by Lawrence Price, Nellie Kehoe's uncle and formerly an executive in charge of Oldsmobile's Lansing Car Assembly.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the people}} to whom Jenner posed his {{question}} was Noel Stanton, a man from Bedfordshire, England, who was serving in Sydney with the Royal Navy at the time. Stanton became preoccupied with the memory of this meeting for several months afterwards and, the next year, became a committed Christian. Stanton went on to found the Jesus Army in Northampton, England, in 1969. In 1945, Jenner approached Norrie Jeffs, who had just returned from participating in Operation Meridian at Palembang on Sumatra, and, having asked Jeffs his question, Jeffs responded that he was already a Christian. Jenner then invited Jeffs over to his house, where Jeffs met several other visitors, including the woman who would later become his wife. In 1952, another person Jenner accosted with his question on George Street was Ian Boyden, a man from Roseville who was serving in the Royal Australian Air Force. After having a brief conversation with Jenner, Boyden accepted Jenner's invitation to attend a church service at Renwick Gospel Hall, where he responded to the sermon by committing to living as a Christian thenceforward, which he did for at least fifty years. <b>Many</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> who had a brief encounter with Jenner on the street in Sydney also became Christians, but Jenner did not realise that any {{of the people}} he accosted had remained a Christian beyond their initial profession of faith until 1953, when Francis Dixon told him the stories of several such people.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{buildings}} {{associated with the}} Russian security forces were targeted.

25|$|May Day {{has been}} celebrated in Ireland since pagan times as {{the feast of}} Beltane (Bealtaine) and in latter times as Mary's day. Traditionally, bonfires were lit to mark the coming of summer and to banish the long nights of winter. Officially Irish May Day holiday is the first Monday in May. Old traditions such as bonfires are no longer widely observed, though the {{practice}} still persists in some places across the country. Limerick, Clare and <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in other counties still keep on this tradition, including areas in Dublin city such as Ringsend.|$|E
50|$|The {{very fact}} that the Bashkirs, as an {{individual}} nation, survived while the Mongols exterminated <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>peoples</b> {{who had lived in}} the adjacency, suggests that special relations existed between the conquerors and the medieval Bashkirs.|$|R
50|$|The {{widespread}} use of Mobilian jargon as a lingua franca throughout the area {{has led to the}} unsupported assumption (e.g. by Gatschet) that the Taensa and <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>peoples</b> of the lower Mississippi and Gulf Coast spoke a Muskogean language.|$|R

25|$|Bunche {{lived in}} the Kew Gardens {{neighborhood}} of Queens, New York, in a home purchased with his Nobel Prize money, from 1953 until his death. Like <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> of color, Bunche continued to struggle against racism across the United States and sometimes in his own neighborhood. In 1959, he and his son, Ralph, Jr., were denied membership in the West Side Tennis Club in the Forest Hills neighborhood of Queens. After the issue was given national coverage by the press, the club offered the Bunches an apology and invitation of membership. The official who had rebuffed them resigned. Bunche refused the offer, saying it was not based on racial equality and was an exception based only on his personal prestige.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there were}} <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> besides special officials, who {{from time to}} time, and {{for a variety of}} reasons, sought to connect their names with a great public service like that of the roads. Gaius Gracchus, when Tribune of the People (123-122 BC), paved or gravelled many of the public roads, and {{provided}} them with milestones and mounting-blocks for riders. Again, Gaius Scribonius Curio, when Tribune (50 BC), sought popularity by introducing a Lex Viaria, under which he was to be chief inspector or commissioner for five years. Dio Cassius mentions as one of the forcible acts of the triumvirs of 43 BC (Octavianus, Antony, and Lepidus), that they obliged the senators to repair the public roads at their own expense.|$|E
25|$|Rusk's {{mountaineering}} career {{took him}} all over the West Coast of the United States, beginning in 1889 and continuing to 1930. He met <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> on his many journeys; however, few people became close friends and learned about his personal life. The few who knew him described {{him as one of}} the most expert and daring mountaineers in the West. While Rusk had some close calls and got himself into some hair raising situations, he had very few accidents while climbing and often saved others from extreme danger. He was not braggadocious about his exploits and in fact would only give the most matter-of-fact answers about them. He was known to be tenacious in his exploits, yet tempered by his good sense and consideration for others with him. Rusk was most familiar with Mount Adams, climbing it many times and exploring the area around it extensively.|$|E
25|$|In {{the western}} part of the country, water {{ownership}} is controlled by the appropriative system. This system states that the owner of a piece of land does not automatically own the rights to water found on that land. Rights to water belong to the first user who puts the water to beneficial use. The first people to become appropriators of the water source have the right to continue using the water in the same quantity as always as long as they continue putting the water to good use. This holds true no matter how <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> wish to use the water. The latest water appropriator loses all of their water rights before any water rights are taken from the next latest appropriator. The Fort Belknap Reservation in Montana, which had been created by the government in 1888, experienced issues with the appropriative water system when water flow to their reservation was being diverted to settlements of non American Indians.|$|E

25|$|On Giorgione's {{premature}} death, Titian {{completed the}} painting {{and went on to}} paint a great many more naked women, most frequently, as Botticelli did, disguising them as goddesses and surrounding them with sylvan woods and starry skies to make perfect decoration for the walls of rich clientele. But it was as a painter of portraits that Titian excelled, his longevity allowing him to achieve far more, both in the way of production and in stylistic development than either Giorgione or his Florentine contemporary Raphael were able to. Titian gave the world images of Pietro Aretino and Pope Paul III and <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> of his day, perhaps his most powerful portrait being that of Doge Andrea Gritti, ruler of Venice, who looms large in the picture space, one huge hand clasping his heavily buttoned robe in a dynamic Expressionistic gesture. Titian is also renowned for his religious painting, his last work being a turbulent and abstracted Pietà.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{submitted}} a long {{paper to the}} War Cabinet in July, recommending that the Allies hold the line, with only limited offensives, {{for the second half}} of 1918, and that their future offensives should have ever greater emphasis on artillery, tanks, aircraft and machine guns. He was convinced that the war would ultimately be won in the west, causing Lloyd George to complain (30 July 1918) that it was “Wully Redivivus”. In his War Memoirs (pp1857–66) Lloyd George later poured scorn on Wilson for seeking the advice of Haig and Petain in this paper and for not having foreseen the Allied victories of autumn 1918, but neither Lloyd George nor <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> did at the time. Wilson also dismissed as unlikely the internal collapse which overcame the Central Powers in late 1918. Wilson also wanted to reinforce the Near East – although not enough to satisfy Amery – lest Germany and Turkey were left free by the collapse of Russia to expand there, which would improve their position in any future war a decade hence. Haig wrote on his copy “words, words, words” and “theoretical rubbish”.|$|E

Racz said if they found him, [...] "That would have meant the end of my dreams to become a doctor. Perhaps I would have ended up in prison. Not that I had done anything but <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> ended up in prison following 1956 without committing any crime."

[...] In the same interview, Hammer asked television host Wendy Walsh of The Doctors about the storyline, to which she responded, [...] "The main theme of the show was about this poor 'stupid' woman who was too dumb to leave her relationship. And domestic violence is far more complicated than that. We're watching someone rationalize a domestic violence relationship {{and this is the}} kind of thought process that actually goes on in real life. It’s not satire anymore." ...|$|E
