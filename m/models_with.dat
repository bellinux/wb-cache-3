40|$|We use the GARCH <b>model</b> <b>with</b> a fat-tailed error {{distribution}} {{described by a}} rational function and apply it for the stock price data on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. To determine the model parameters we perform the Bayesian inference to the model. The Bayesian inference is implemented by the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with an adaptive multi-dimensional Student's t-proposal density. In order to compare the <b>model</b> <b>with</b> the GARCH <b>model</b> <b>with</b> the standard normal errors we calculate information criterions: AIC and DIC, and find that both criterions favor the GARCH <b>model</b> <b>with</b> a rational {{error distribution}}. We also calculate {{the accuracy of the}} volatility by using the realized volatility and find that a good accuracy is obtained for the GARCH <b>model</b> <b>with</b> a rational error distribution. Thus we conclude that the GARCH <b>model</b> <b>with</b> a rational error distribution is superior to the GARCH <b>model</b> <b>with</b> the normal errors and it can be used as an alternative GARCH <b>model</b> to those <b>with</b> other fat-tailed distributions.
