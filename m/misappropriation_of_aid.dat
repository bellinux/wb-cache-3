40|$|Abstract Introduction Cyclone Nargis hit Burma on May 2, 2008, killing over 138, 000 and {{affecting}} {{at least}} 2. 4 million people. The Burmese military junta, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), initially blocked international aid to storm victims, forcing community-based {{organizations such as}} the Emergency Assistance Teams-Burma (EAT) to fill the void, helping with cyclone relief and long-term reconstruction. Recognizing the need for independent monitoring of the human rights situation in cyclone-affected areas, particularly given censorship over storm relief coverage, EAT initiated such documentation efforts. Methods A human rights investigation was conducted to document selected human rights abuses that had initially been reported to volunteers providing relief services in cyclone affected areas. Using participatory research methods and qualitative, semi-structured interviews, EAT volunteers collected 103 testimonies from August 2008 to June 2009; 42 from relief workers and 61 from storm survivors. Results One year after the storm, basic necessities such as food, potable water, and shelter remained insufficient for many, a situation exacerbated by lack of support to help rebuild livelihoods and worsening household debt. This precluded many survivors from being able to access healthcare services, which were inadequate even before Cyclone Nargis. Aid efforts continued to be met with government restrictions and harassment, and relief workers continued to face threats and fear of arrest. Abuses, including land confiscation and <b>misappropriation</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid,</b> were reported during reconstruction, and tight government control over communication and information exchange continued. Conclusions Basic needs of many cyclone survivors in the Irrawaddy Delta remained unmet over a year following Cyclone Nargis. Official impediments to delivery of aid to storm survivors continued, including human rights abrogations experienced by civilians during reconstruction efforts. Such issues remain unaddressed in official assessments conducted in partnership with the SPDC. Private, community-based relief organizations like EAT are well positioned and able to independently assess human rights conditions in response to complex humanitarian emergencies such as Cyclone Nargis; efforts of this nature must be encouraged, particularly in settings where human rights abuses have been documented and censorship is widespread. </p...|$|E

40|$|Humanitarian aid as it {{is known}} in present days has its origins in 19 th century and since then it has gone through many {{important}} changes, developments and streams of thoughts. The aim of this thesis is to describe the changing character <b>of</b> humanitarian <b>aid,</b> its constraints and failures and the means of tackling them with emphasis on evolution during the last twenty years. The thesis deals mainly with failures caused by inaccurate assessment of needs of the victims of humanitarian crisis, constraints complicating complying with the principles of humanitarian action, limitations arising from the respect of state sovereignty and the problem <b>of</b> <b>misappropriation</b> <b>of</b> humanitarian <b>aid</b> and corruption. The shift in solving problems will be presented on the case of Czech non-governmental organization People in Need...|$|R
2500|$|Following Biti's arrest, Bvudzijena, {{the police}} spokesman, {{said that he}} would be charged with treason, based on an MDC {{document}} about changing the government. Bvudzijena said that Biti would additionally be charged with making false statements [...] "prejudicial to the state" [...] due to his announcement of election results prior to their release by the Electoral Commission. US Ambassador McGee expressed deep concern on behalf of the US government, saying that the document in question was an unobjectionable statement of the MDC's plans and goals; according to McGee, another, more extreme version of the document existed, but it was forged. He called on SADC to send [...] "three or four times" [...] as many observers as the 400 it planned to send. McGee also alleged that 20 tons <b>of</b> US food <b>aid</b> had been confiscated and distributed to ZANU-PF supporters, contrary to its intended use, in the previous week. McGee said that he had complained about this <b>misappropriation</b> <b>of</b> food <b>aid</b> but that he had received no response: [...] "The bottom line is, they don't care".|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the relationship between the financial expertise of the audit committee (AC) and the incidence <b>of</b> <b>misappropriation</b> <b>of</b> assets in publicly held companies in the USA. Design/methodology/approach – The sample consists of 28 publicly held companies in the USA experiencing <b>misappropriation</b> <b>of</b> assets from 1987 to 1998, as well as 28 control companies matched according to size, industry, and time period. The effectiveness of the AC's financial expertise in reducing the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>misappropriation</b> <b>of</b> assets is examined by logistic models using two specific types of financial expertise: accounting and non-accounting financial expertise. Findings – The results support the notion that an independent AC member is only effective in reducing the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>misappropriation</b> <b>of</b> assets in publicly held companies if he/she is also a financial expert. Research limitations/implications – The paper contributes to the debate on the appropriate definition of “financial expert” and the efficacy of the financial expertise of AC members – as defined by the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation – in reducing the incidence <b>of</b> <b>misappropriation</b> <b>of</b> assets in publicly held companies in the USA. The paper includes only 28 cases <b>of</b> <b>misappropriation</b> <b>of</b> assets by employees involving collusion with an outsider, as discovered and reported in the news (i. e. newsworthy cases). Originality/value – While previous studies have drawn attention to the relationship between AC independence and <b>misappropriation</b> <b>of</b> assets, there is no empirical evidence to support or to refute the hypothesis that financial expertise has an impact on the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>misappropriation</b> <b>of</b> assets. This paper is the first to examine the association between the effectiveness of the AC and the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>misappropriation</b> <b>of</b> assets by testing the interaction between AC members' financial expertise and their independence.

40|$|Traditional {{knowledge}} (TK) {{plays an}} important role in the global economy and is valuable not only to those who traditionally depend on it in their daily lives, but also to modern industry, especially the global biotechnology, pharmaceutical and agribusiness corporations. Yet the exploitation of TK by these industries does not usually lead to corresponding benefits to indigenous communities either in the form of attribution or compensation. Such <b>misappropriations</b> <b>of</b> TK are <b>aided</b> by the fact that the global intellectual property (IP) regime as presently structured is based entirely on the traditionally western or conventional description of knowledge, as are its conceptions of individual intellectual property ownership. In response to the fact that their calls for the reform of the global patent system have not be heeded, most developing countries, including South Africa, have resorted to the adoption of a radically different strategy in their approach to intellectual property, particularly as it concerns the protection of their TK from misappropriation. This is evident in the adoption of strategic measures in South Africa for the protection of various aspects of its TK forms from misappropriation, such as the National Recordal System (NRS) and Disclosure of Origins (DRs). This paper seeks to explore the implications of these measures in leveraging TK within the structure, content and conceptual framework of the patent system in South Africa. The focus is on TK associated with the medicinal uses of plants (TKMUP) ...|$|R
