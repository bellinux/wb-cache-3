5|$|The ships' {{anti-aircraft}} batteries were {{revised and}} improved {{throughout the course}} of their careers. The original single-mounted 8.8cm guns were replaced with twin mounts for the new 8.8 cm SK C/32 guns and a third twin mount was also installed, bringing the number of guns to six. Eight 3.7 cm SK C/30 guns were installed in the mid-1930s and up to eight 2 cm Flak 30 guns were also added. Köln, the only ship to survive {{to the end of the}} war, was ultimately armed with eight 3.7cm and eighteen 2cm guns, though provisions had been made to <b>mount</b> <b>up</b> to ten and twenty-four guns of the two calibers, respectively.|$|E

The following year the competition was expanded to the Super 14, introducing one new team from Australia and one new team from South Africa.|$|E
25|$|Brian Statham was fit again and, {{despite his}} good {{performance}} at Lord's, Coldwell {{had to give}} way. England also recalled John Murray, replacing Geoff Millman as the keeper, and preferred Fred Titmus to Tony Lock who was expensive during the Burki-Nasim stand at Lord's. Pakistan, whose injury problems were beginning to <b>mount</b> <b>up,</b> made three changes because Imtiaz, Wallis Mathias and D'Souza could not play. Their replacements were Butt, who had played at Edgbaston but not at Lord's, fast-medium bowler Munir Malik and off-spinner Javed Akhtar who had literally just arrived from Pakistan, having been called up as a reinforcement. With the winter tour still more {{on the minds of}} the England selectors than anything else, they decided to let Cowdrey captain the team in this match. Javed Burki captained Pakistan as in the two previous Tests.|$|E

500|$|The Somerset {{section of}} the canal was {{suitable}} for tub-boats, which were about [...] long and capable of carrying eight tons. The Devon section was suitable for larger broad-beam barges, carrying up to 40tons. Income from tolls increased steadily from £971 in 1835, rising to £2754 in 1838 and £4926 in 1844. At this point, competition from the railways started. The Bristol and Exeter Railway reached Taunton in 1842 and Exeter in 1844. A branch to Tiverton was opened in 1848, and although the canal company received £1200 for loss of trade while an aqueduct was constructed over {{the line of the}} railway, deficits started to <b>mount</b> <b>up</b> almost immediately.|$|E
500|$|The {{image of}} life as a sea voyage to the Kingdom of Heaven in the first recitative comes from the opening of the Gospel reading: [...] "There He went on board a ship and passed over and came into His own city" [...] (...) [...] Affirmations that God will not forsake the {{faithful}} on this journey and will lead them out of tribulation come from [...] and [...] The third movement expresses the joy at being united with the Saviour; the text comes from : [...] "Those that wait upon the Lord shall gain new strength so that they <b>mount</b> <b>up</b> with wings like an eagle, so that they run and do not grow weary." [...] This joy is coupled with a yearning for death, a theme that is present until {{the very end of the}} work. The concluding chorale is the sixth stanza of Johann Franck's hymn [...] "" [...] (1653), which also alludes to the ship imagery, saying [...] "Löse meines Schiffleins Ruder, bringe mich an sichern Port" [...] (release the rudder of my little ship, bring me to the secure harbor). Before the chorale, the final lines of the opening aria taken from Revelation 7:17 ("there my Savior himself will wipe away my tears") are heard once more.|$|E

2500|$|F. Núñez de la Vega, {{bishop of}} Chiapa, says, {{in the preface}} to his Synodal Constitutions, that in the visit which he made to his diocese {{towards the end of the}} last century , he found many ancient {{calendars}} of the Chiapanese, and an old manuscript in the language of that country, made by the Indians themselves, in which it was said, according to their ancient tradition, that a certain person named Votan was present at that great building, which was made by order of his uncle, in order to <b>mount</b> <b>up</b> to heaven; that then every people was given its language, and that Votan himself was charged by God to make the division of the lands of Anahuac. [...] The prelate adds afterwards, that there was in his time in Teopixca a great settlement of that diocese, a family of the surname of Votan, who were the reputed descendants of that ancient populator. [...] We are not here endeavoring to give the antiquity to the populator of America on the faith of the Chiapanese, but merely to shew that the Americans conceived themselves the descendants of Noah.|$|E
2500|$|As Einem went {{on holiday}} to the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom during August and September 1983, {{the case against}} him began to <b>mount</b> <b>up.</b> Forensic {{investigators}} were able to match the many fibres found on Kelvin's clothing to those taken from Einem's home, along with hairs found which matched those belonging to him. Forensics also determined that Kelvin was murdered between 8 July and 10 July 1983 and was dumped at the airstrip no later than the 10th. However, police raids on various locations around Adelaide linked to Einem yielded few clues. Police also searched {{for a man who}} had previously claimed to police during the investigation of the unsolved murder of Alan Barnes in 1979 that Einem had been involved in his death and also that he was a former associate of Einem. Barnes's fatal injuries mirrored those of Kelvin closely. The man, known as [...] "Mr. B", was located and informed police in great detail how he and Einem had picked up young male hitchhikers, had given them alcoholic drinks laced with hypnotic drugs, and had taken them to Einem's previous home in the Adelaide suburb of Campbelltown, where the young men had been abused overnight and released the next day. [...] "Mr B" [...] also provided further information about other associates of Einem, but claimed he took no part whatsoever in any murders. Police also questioned other people whom Einem had associated with, but they volunteered little information. With enough evidence, along with the information given by [...] "Mr B", to indicate that Richard Kelvin was at Einem's home around the time of his death, police arrested and charged Einem with murder on 3 November 1983. Einem still denied ever coming into contact with Kelvin.|$|E
