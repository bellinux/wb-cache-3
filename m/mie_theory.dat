In many places in the eastern United States and especially over large parts of Europe, the sun, moon and stars were seen blue in color in September 1950. Using <b>Mie's</b> <b>theory</b> and some extinction measurements, the radius of the particles is calculated to be between 0. 5 and 0. 8 A and the concentration 175 /cm 3 and 127 /cm 3.

Three size spectra are assumed, case 1 deals with a uniform size, cases 2 and 3 with a Gaussian distribution of the size spectrum. The refractive index for water droplets is chosen, but it is also studied carefully for other substances. The radius becomes larger for ice at low temperatures and smaller for pure smoke; the total number varies inversely to the radius, but the extinction coefficient remains unchanged.
