25|$|The Fur Formation is {{a unit of}} diatomitic {{sediment}} approximately 60 meters thick {{consisting of}} diatoms and clay minerals with up to 180 layers of volcanic ash. In Danish literature the formation has informally {{been referred to as}} the <b>moler</b> (Ler means clay). The diatomite comprises 2/3 opal tests of diatoms and 1/3 clay, interbedded with layers of volcanic ash and a few limestone horizons (‘cementstones’), and has exceptionally complete fossil preservation.|$|E

25|$|The {{new church}} nave {{and the south}} hallway with oratory were built in 1511. Oratory has {{decoration}} with Late Gothic motifs of rotating flamed tracery. As it is known from the latest research, vaulted bolts in the southern nave still have the original polychrome colours. Stone portraits of Hungarian kings: st. Ladislaus, st. Stephen. and st. Imrich on the heel of vault on the southern wall of the south nave were polychromed by painter Peter <b>Moler.</b> Fillings of tracery windows were painted red, arch ribs in naves were painted white. An inscription tape was painted on the triumphal arch of the south {{with the beginning of}} rebuilding of the temple in 1502. In 1514-1515 Master Jan rebuilt the temple tower. He vaulted the tower with circular vault on the ground floor. It is the only circular vault in Eastern Slovakia.|$|E
500|$|The first {{newspaper}} in Blackford County was The Hartford City Times, which {{was started by}} Dr. John <b>Moler</b> in 1852. [...] <b>Moler</b> ran a drug store and print shop, and the Times was mostly an advertiser. [...] At least one source considers The Blackford County News, which was started later in 1852, as the county’s first newspaper—possibly because the Times was mostly for advertising. [...] Across the county in Montpelier, The Montpelier Examiner {{was first published in}} 1879, and that newspaper is the predecessor of the town’s long-time newspaper, The Montpelier Herald. The county's first daily newspaper, the Evening News, was started in 1894 by Edward Everett Cox. [...] This Hartford City newspaper was eventually renamed Hartford City News. [...] After Cox’s death in the 1930s, the Cox family sold the Hartford City News to the owners of Hartford City’s Times-Gazette, and the combined entity became the Hartford City News-Times.|$|E

500|$|The {{source code}} for Quake III was not {{released}} until QuakeCon 2005, but {{copies of the}} fast inverse square root code appeared on Usenet and other forums as early as 2002 or 2003. Initial speculation pointed to John Carmack as the probable author of the code, but he demurred and suggested {{it was written by}} Terje Mathisen, an accomplished assembly programmer who had previously helped id Software with Quake optimization. [...] Mathisen had written an implementation of a similar bit of code in the late 1990s, but the original authors proved to be much further back in the history of 3D computer graphics with Gary Tarolli's implementation for the SGI Indigo as a possible earliest known use. Rys Sommefeldt concluded that the original algorithm was devised by Greg Walsh at Ardent Computer in consultation with Cleve <b>Moler,</b> the creator of MATLAB. Cleve <b>Moler</b> learned about this trick from code written by William Kahan and K.C. Ng at Berkeley around 1986 [...] Jim Blinn also demonstrated a simple approximation of the inverse square root in a 1997 column for IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications.|$|E

25|$|Of {{the many}} Gothic {{sculpture}}s {{from the early}} 16th century, the Archangel Gabriel, crucifixion and small sculpture of Christ sufferer by Master Paul have been preserved. The original sculpture of Calvary on beam of triumphal arch allegedly damaged fire in the 17th century. The monumental sculpture of the crucified has extremely high artistic quality and its dramatic expressive comprehension is {{the evidence of the}} fact that it was created under the influence of German art in the first half of the 14th century. From the Gothic wing altars on both sides 14 painted panels were preserved, originally belonged to the altar of St. Nicholas and the Virgin Mary. They are traditionally attributed to craftsman Peter and Albert <b>Molers</b> from Presov; they worked on them in 1497-1506. Older written sources mention also the panel painting of St. Anny Samotretia who got to Nemzeti Museum in Budapest. A Gothic temple facilities also include mural paintings on the north wall of the middle presbytery from the late 15th and the early 16th century, which displays a knight on horseback and female figures.|$|R

[...] "At the time this assumption went more or less unchallenged, for although there were those around who felt sure that the phrase had been played on a valve instrument [...] - [...] nobody {{had ever heard of}} Mole using anything but the slide.
