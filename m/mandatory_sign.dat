5000|$|On May 5, 2014, Campfield drew {{widespread}} {{criticism for}} a blog post comparing mandatory signups under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) to the [...] "train rides" [...] the Jews took under Nazi Germany ("Democrats bragging {{about the number}} of <b>mandatory</b> <b>sign</b> ups for Obamacare is like Germans bragging {{about the number of}} <b>mandatory</b> <b>sign</b> ups for 'train rides' for Jews in the 40s."). Campfield responded to the criticism saying it missed his point about [...] "government mandates and bureaucrats deciding who should be given life saving medications and who should be denied" [...] and government funding for abortion.|$|E
50|$|Mandatory {{road signs}} {{can be used}} to {{allocate}} certain areas to specific vehicles - the Vienna Convention explicitly mentions footpaths, cyclepaths and bridleways, but tramways, bus lanes, taxi lanes, HOV lanes and snow mobile tracks can also be designated with mandatory signs. When a specific area of roadway is designated with a <b>mandatory</b> <b>sign</b> specifying a vehicle type, all traffic of this type must use this area if possible. These signs can be combined by putting one pictogram above the other. If the pictograms are side-by-side however, with the sign divided by a white vertical line, each type of vehicle must stay within the lane indicated by the sign. A red line through a <b>mandatory</b> <b>sign</b> indicates not that a vehicle of a specific type is prohibited from entering the designated area, but that the area is now deregulated and any vehicle may use it.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mandatory</b> <b>signs</b> {{are used}} to set the {{obligations}} of all traffic which use a specific area of road. Unlike prohibitory or restrictive <b>signs,</b> <b>mandatory</b> <b>signs</b> tell traffic what it must do, rather than must not do.|$|R

50|$|The <b>mandatory</b> <b>sign</b> {{group is}} not used in Australia, Ecuador, or the United States, none of which are signatories to the Vienna Convention. Canada has {{developed}} its own style using a green circle, which {{is not used}} in any other country. The U.S. instead uses black arrows and border on taller-than-wide rectangular white signs, often with the word ONLY below the arrow. Below is a chart comparing {{some of the most}} common mandatory signs.|$|E
50|$|Mandatory {{signs are}} {{a subset of the}} {{regulatory}} sign group as defined by the United Nations Economic and Social Council in the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals of 1968, and are often seen not just on their own, but used in conjunction with other signs, traffic lights and bollards as a form of visual shorthand within these objects. In Vienna Convention signatories, the <b>mandatory</b> <b>sign</b> is either a light blue circle with a white border (Type A) or a white circle with a red border (Type B). The sign must be at least 60 cm (1.96 ft) across on rural roads, or 40 cm (1.31 ft) in built-up areas, although mandatory signs incorporated in traffic lights, bollards or larger road signs can be as little as 30 cm (0.98 ft) in diameter.|$|E
50|$|BXW {{symptoms}} can be sorted {{into two}} domains: symptoms on the inflorescence and symptoms on the fruit. Symptoms on the fruit are usually used to distinguish BXW from alternative banana diseases. A bacterial ooze is excreted {{from the plant}} organs {{and this is a}} <b>mandatory</b> <b>sign</b> that BXW may be present. Common symptoms on the fruit include internal discoloration and premature ripening of the fruit. A cross section of the BXW infected banana is characterized by the yellow- orange discoloration of the vascular bundles and dark brown tissue scaring. Symptoms on the inflorescence include a gradual wilting and yellowing of the leaves plus wilting of the bracts and shriveling of the male buds. Many factors may affect the combination of disease symptoms on show. These include the particular cultivar infected, how the disease has been transmitted and the current growing season.Symptoms normally appear within 3 weeks after infection, although the time taken to reach different stages of symptom expression may differ depending on the cultivar, plant growth stage, mode of disease transmission and environmental conditions. The symptoms expression were found to be faster in AAA-EA cooking varieties compared to ABB cultivars, in young plants compared to mature plants and during the wet season compared to the dry season. Infected plants show a progressive yellowing and wilting of the leaves, and uneven and premature ripening of the fruit. Male bud symptoms are firstly observed if an infection has occurred via the male inflorescence part, while leaf wilting symptoms are the first to be observed if the infection occurred via other plant parts such as roots, corm, leaf sheaths and leaves.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mandatory</b> <b>signs</b> are {{road signs}} {{which are used}} to set the {{obligations}} of all traffic which use a specific area of road.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{analysis}} of 8 drivers’ behavior while driving through pedestrian crossing during dusk and night. Monitored vehicle passes through modern crosswalk in urban {{area that is}} marked with horizontal and vertical road signs. The crossing is illuminated from left side {{from the direction of}} travel. Pedestrian is protected with safety island, which is marked with “passing on the right” <b>mandatory</b> <b>sign,</b> {{in the middle of the}} road. Optical reactions on various stimuli are monitored while driving with the help of the specialized device Viewpointsystem®, GmgH for monitoring changes of driver’s viewing angle. Drivers’ behavior strategies when passing the crosswalk are compared in this thesis. Monitored are driver’s navigation while driving and his reaction on the crossing pedestrian. Dangerousness of each driving situation is assessed and each strategy is evaluated. Results of this analysis are based on extensive driving tests that were realized in close cooperation of Institute of Forensic Engineering, University of Technology in Brno and research institute EPIGUS – Institut für ganzheitliche Unfall- und Sicherheitforshung from Austria in year 2010...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Mandatory</b> <b>signs</b> {{can also}} be used to issue {{instructions}} to all vehicles - common examples include [...] "pass on this side" [...] signs seen at roadworks, and [...] "compulsory roundabout" [...] signs seen at mini-roundabouts. Other signs of the type include [...] "attach snow chains" [...] and [...] "remove snow chains" [...] seen at the entry and exit points of mountainous areas, and [...] "compulsory direction for vehicles carrying dangerous loads", used to divert vehicles carrying explosives or poisonous chemicals away from areas with open flames such as oil refineries. Minimum speed limits {{can also be}} defined using <b>mandatory</b> road <b>signs,</b> although such signs are rare in most countries; the U.S., which does not use <b>mandatory</b> <b>signs,</b> instead places minimum speed limits on the same type of panel as maximum speed limits.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mandatory</b> <b>signs</b> are {{generally}} circular {{with a white}} border and symbol on a blue background. They usually indicate something all drivers must do (e.g. keep left) or a facility available to certain classes of traffic (e.g. pedal cycles only).|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{proposes a}} new {{recognition}} algorithm of mandatory traffic sings using the Hausdorff distance. This algorithm {{has been designed}} to detect arrows on traffic signs, especially direction signs. The arrows on these <b>mandatory</b> <b>signs</b> appear in a multitude of different forms and positions. Due to this variety this algorithm uses a structural approach to recognize the arrows. First the sign is transformed into a binary bitmap. The second stage consists in computing the skeleton of the arrows that appear in the <b>mandatory</b> <b>signs</b> of the image. The algorithm calculates de Hausdorff distance between some models of skeletons of arrows and the skeleton obtained. The algorithm recognizes the model that produces the smallest Hausdorff distance...|$|R
50|$|Regulatory signs either give {{positive}} instructions, i.e. <b>Mandatory</b> <b>signs,</b> or {{indicate a}} prohibition, i.e. Prohibitionary signs.

50|$|Like many South American countries, {{the road}} signs in Brazil are {{strongly}} {{based on the}} US MUTCD standard, but with text in Portuguese. The regulatory, prohibitory and <b>mandatory</b> <b>signs</b> are all of them white circular with red borders, {{with the exception of}} the stop and the yield sign. The warning signs are yellow diamonds (or orange when used on road works). Units are expressed in compliance with the International System of Units.|$|R
50|$|Chile is a {{signatory}} to the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals, {{and therefore}} its signs are compliant with international standards. Chile uses yellow diamonds for warning signs {{in common with}} {{most of the rest of}} the Americas. Speed limit signs are a red circle with a white background and the limitation in black, and are in kilometres per hour. There are also some signs unique to Chile. Chile also currently uses a mixture of both types of <b>mandatory</b> <b>signs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|With the {{exception}} of the special designs used for Stop, Yield, and No Entry <b>signs,</b> <b>mandatory</b> <b>signs</b> (e.g. Must Turn Left) are round with a blue background, white border, and a white pictogram.

50|$|The {{traffic sign}} {{are divided into}} three classes; circles gives orders, triangles warns of {{possible}} dangers and rectangles gives information. Different colours are use within these shapes; blue circles are <b>mandatory</b> <b>signs,</b> it give positive instructions, while red circles are prohibitory signs, it give negative instructions. Blue rectangles give general information while green rectangles are use for direction sign on main roads. However, there are two exception for these shapes and colour rules; that is the octagonal Stop sign and the inverted red triangle Give way sign.|$|R
50|$|The {{exceptions}} are the octagonal red STOP sign, the triangular GIVE WAY sign {{and the various}} <b>mandatory</b> STOP <b>signs</b> that are circular and have a red border.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} cascade method for fast and {{accurate}} traffic sign detection.
