Traditionally {{they were made}} from bronze but due to the disruption and loss of trade routes between the islands of Borneo and Mindanao during World War II, resulting in loss of access to necessary <b>metal</b> <b>ores,</b> and the subsequent post-war use of scrap metal, brass gongs with shorter decaying tones are now commonplace.|$|E
5|$|Having {{taken as}} much Serbian land as he could, King Tvrtko turned his {{attention}} to the coast. The rapid economic growth of Bosnia, having begun during the reign of Tvrtko's uncle, continued unabated even during the political upheavels that followed Tvrtko's accession. The export of <b>metal</b> <b>ores</b> and metalwork (mainly silver, copper and lead) formed the backbone of the Bosnian economy. These goods were transported over the Dinaric Alps to the seashore, where they were bought chiefly by the Republics of Ragusa and Venice. The maritime cities of Ragusa and Kotor also depended on Tvrtko's realm for food, a dependency the king leveraged to increase the initially low and, for the Bosnians, disadvantageous prices. Yet, Bosnia could not make economic use of its share of the Adriatic coast, from the river Neretva to the Bay of Kotor, which lacked any major settlements. The three major cities in the area were all controlled by Hungary: Drijeva (which Tvrtko was forced to cede to Louis in 1357), Ragusa, and Kotor.|$|E

25|$|Practical {{attempts}} {{to improve the}} refining of ores and their extraction to smelt metals was {{an important source of}} information for early chemists in the 16th century, among them Georg Agricola (1494–1555), who published his great work De re metallica in 1556. His work describes the highly developed and complex processes of mining <b>metal</b> <b>ores,</b> metal extraction and metallurgy of the time. His approach removed the mysticism associated with the subject, creating the practical base upon which others could build.|$|E
25|$|As {{indicated}} above, many metal ions {{react with}} hydrogen sulfide {{to give the}} corresponding metal sulfides. This conversion is widely exploited. For example, gases or waters contaminated by hydrogen sulfide can be cleaned with metal sulfides. In the purification of <b>metal</b> <b>ores</b> by flotation, mineral powders are often treated with hydrogen sulfide to enhance the separation. Metal parts are sometimes passivated with hydrogen sulfide. Catalysts used in hydrodesulfurization are routinely activated with hydrogen sulfide, and the behavior of metallic catalysts used {{in other parts of}} a refinery is also modified using hydrogen sulfide.|$|E
25|$|As time progressed metal objects {{became more}} common, and ever more complex. The need to further acquire and work metals grew in importance. Skills related to extracting <b>metal</b> <b>ores</b> {{from the earth}} began to evolve, and metalsmiths became more knowledgeable. Metalsmiths became {{important}} members of society. Fates and economies of entire civilizations were greatly affected by the availability of metals and metalsmiths. The metalworker depends on the extraction of precious metals to make jewelry, build more efficient electronics, and for industrial and technological applications from construction to shipping containers to rail, and air transport. Without metals, goods and services would cease to move around the globe on the scale we know today.|$|E

25|$|Most metals {{occur in}} nature in their {{oxidized}} form (ores) and thus must {{be reduced to}} their metallic forms. The ore is dissolved following some preprocessing in an aqueous electrolyte or in a molten salt and the resulting solution is electrolyzed. The metal is deposited on the cathode (either in solid or in liquid form), while the anodic reaction is usually oxygen evolution. Several metals are naturally present as metal sulfides; these include copper, lead, molybdenum, cadmium, nickel, silver, cobalt, and zinc. In addition, gold and platinum group metals are associated with sulfidic base <b>metal</b> <b>ores.</b> Most metal sulfides or their salts, are electrically conductive and this allows electrochemical redox reactions to efficiently occur in the molten state or in aqueous solutions.|$|E
25|$|From {{the start}} of the war until Germany invaded the Soviet Union less than two years later, Stalin {{supplied}} Hitler with 1.5 million tons of oil, the same quantity of grain, and many thousands of tons of rubber, timber, phosphates, iron, and other valuable <b>metal</b> <b>ores,</b> particularly chromium, manganese, and platinum. At the time of the invasion, Nazi Germany was heavily in debt to the Soviet Union. Russian historians dispute the importance of the Soviet Union's trade with Germany. They point out that in mid-1941 Germany's oil resources totalled 10 million tons: of these 500,000 were produced in Germany proper, 800,000 by the countries occupied by Germany, and 8,700,000 tons by Germany's European allies, with Romania accounting for the bulk of this amount.|$|E
25|$|Man has mined {{metals and}} <b>metal</b> <b>ores</b> in Wales for millennia. There are Bronze Age copper {{workings}} on the Great Orme near Llandudno and at Parys Mountain on Anglesey. Gold has been obtained since pre-Roman times {{at places like}} Dolaucothi. Lead and zinc were intensively mined in the Cwmystwyth area of mid Wales and a lead mine operated at Minera near Wrexham from the Middle Ages until the early twentieth century. In Victorian times the Sygun Copper Mine was opened near Beddgelert in Snowdonia.

25|$|Agricultural {{activities}} {{remained the}} mainstay of the economy, supplemented as before by hunting and gathering. Simple wooden scratch-plows were already used, pulled by oxen. Millet, wheat, rye, oats and barley were grown in field systems, while in the gardens bean and lentil were cultivated, as well as oil-producing poppy, turnips and flax, whose fiber made linen thread. Animal husbandry methods improved when iron utensils became more common, that is beginning in the 6th century BC. Horses were bred and utilized more often, {{in addition to the}} traditionally kept cattle, swine, sheep and goats, and improved feed storage allowed keeping the herds throughout the winter season. Salt springs were used for salt production. In Wieliczka area in particular salt was being manufactured already during the Bronze Age, with large scale extraction taking place during the Hallstatt periods. In southern Poland the Lusatians tried to exploit the locally available <b>metal</b> <b>ores.</b>|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of the missions, the native peoples knew only how to utilize bone, seashells, stone, and wood for building, tool making, weapons, and so forth.
