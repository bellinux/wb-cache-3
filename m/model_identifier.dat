In this method, the pit settlement is decomposed into the trend settlement and the stochastic settlement by using Wavelet Analysis {{based on the}} characteristic of influencing factor. The <b>model</b> <b>identifier</b> is established by using artificial neural network (ANN), and trained to approximate the trend settlement. Then, the prediction controller developed could be applied for estimating the actual settlement. Finally, the verification examples show that the WIAN is an effective tool for predicting the pit settlement dynamically, high precision could be expected and achieved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract：To {{solve the}} serious {{problem of the}} {{nonlinear}} and Time-varying uncertainty of the valve-control-cylinder system, a control system was designed with neural-proportion-integral-differential (PID) theory. Because of the capacity of neural network, the control system showed adaptive capacity in the system of valve-control-cylinder. In this paper, the basic theory of a single neural element self-adaptive PID controller and a <b>model</b> <b>identifier</b> based on Radial Basis Function were described. The mathematic model of the valve-control-cylinder control system was set up. The simulation results prove that the neural-PID system can regulate the PID parameters dynamically by self-learning so that the system with the neural-PID controller showed quick track performance and capacity against the disturbance. The results also prove the validity and applicability of the system. The algorithm is simple, PID initial parameters are easy to adjust, easy in application of the real-time control the valve-control-cylinder system...|$|E

For example, the 1934 Standard Cabin YKC was redesignated as a YKC-S in 1935, and as a YKS-6 in 1936. 1936 also saw the adoption of a numerical suffix to indicate the model year of the design, as [...] "-6" [...] for 1936, [...] "-7" [...] for 1937, etc. Since it referred to a model and not the year of production, the [...] "-7" [...] was carried into 1939 for some Custom Cabins, while others were designated [...] "-8".

40|$|Objects can be seen, at an {{abstract}} level, as information tokens made of two parts: an identification part and state, or value part. The identification part contains an object identifier {{different from that}} of any other object. The state part contains instead a structured value denoting the collective value of the attributes of the object. While the identifier assigned to an object remains fixed, the state is allowed to change, i. e. different values {{can be found in the}} state part of the object at different times. An object <b>model</b> with <b>identifiers</b> abstracts the formal properties of identity achieving a neat separation between object identification and object representation. Object identification becomes therefore a formal property preserved by the system. Traditional approaches in data and knowledge representation use instead some aspects of individuals´ state, which only occasionally satisfy the uniqueness and continuity properties of identity. The problem is that identificative attributes chosen at a given time, may carry different values or may not be unique as the context changes; in general, identification is conceptually different from representation. The paper proposes an ontological foundation for the concept of object state and identity, showing formally the equivalence with the infinite properties which are inherent in the cognition of real world distinct entities (Leibniz´ principle) ...|$|R

To avoid this penalty, we propose to extend the Liapunov design technique of building adaptive (on-line) identifiers, so far developed for linear systems with constant parameters. The standard study of stability of an error-equation is replaced by investigating convergence to diagonal set in the Cartesian product of state-parameter spaces of the <b>model</b> and the <b>identifier.</b> We also attempt to stabilize the model.

In the context of Malaysian English speakers, the variability is highly complex due to sociolinguistic and cultural background. Past researches focused on vowel classification of Malaysian English on a small dataset with limited number of speakers and text corpus. Among speaker specific characteristics, gender is the most prominent features, which is followed by accents. This project approached the issues of speaker and speech variability in Malaysian English by proposing identifier that combined the gender and accent aspects. This method is fulfilled by training the classifier with gender-dependent data and accent-prone text corpus. The genderaccent database collected is comprised of 120 speakers categorized into four genderaccent groups namely Malay Female (CF), Malay Male (MM), Chinese Female (CF) and Chinese Male (CM). MFCC algorithm is used to extract the features, while GMM is the algorithm used to <b>model</b> the <b>identifier.</b> Findings from the test results show that female and Chinese speakers have higher degree of distinctiveness compared to other accent-gender groups. Chinese female is the best recognized accent-gender group, meanwhile Malay Male is the least recognized, due to codemixing of Malay language and English. Optimum configuration of GMM is also studied across 3 different numbers of Gaussians (12, 24, and 32). It is found that 24 is the most optimal configuration of MFCC-GMM. Meanwhile, it is also known that MFCC-GMM performs better than LPC-KNN on noisy dataset.
