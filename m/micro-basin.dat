In this study, plot experiments were conducted to assess the efficiency of <b>micro-basin</b> tillage on sloping croplands between 2012 and 2013 (5 °and 7 °). The conceptual, optimal, block interval model was used to design micro-basins which are meant to capture the maximum amount of water per unit area. Results indicated that when compared to the up-down slope tillage, <b>micro-basin</b> tillage could increase soil water content and maize yield by about 45 % and 17 %, and reduce runoff, sediment and nutrients loads by about 63 %, 96 % and 86 %, respectively. Meanwhile, <b>micro-basin</b> tillage could reduce the peak runoff rates and delay the initial runoff-yielding time. In addition, <b>micro-basin</b> tillage with the optimal block interval proved to be the best one among all treatments with different intervals. Compared with treatments of other block intervals, the optimal block interval treatments increased soil moisture by around 10 % and reduced runoff rate by around 15 %.

Costa Rica {{is a very}} mountainous territory, with faulting, steed {{slopes and}} climatic conditions, which {{promotes}} landslides generation that can be aggravated with trigger variables. Historically, Central valley has high susceptibility to landslides. To prevent a disaster is necessary to implement models that identify areas prone to earth movements. The Vahrson and Mora method was used during this study development, due to its ease of use and high implementation in America. This study aimed to develop maps of landslides susceptibility in the <b>micro-basin</b> of rivers Torres and Tibas. Torres River <b>micro-basin</b> {{is located in the}} province of San José and has 4952 ha approximately and the <b>micro-basin</b> of Tibás River covers about 4640 ha and is located in Heredia. To elaborate maps, data from passive slope elements, lithology and soil moisture were obtained, including active elements of seismic intensity and rain intensity. An influence index was defined for each factor and susceptibility maps were generated; active factors were added and multiplied by passive factors. Then, the resulting maps of the passive factors were multiplied with the resulting maps from the active factors to obtain the susceptibility map for each <b>micro-basin.</b> In the Torres River <b>micro-basin</b> the greatest area corresponded to average susceptibility (52, 48 % area) and only 1, 34 % had high susceptibility to suffer landslide. In the Tibás River <b>micro-basin</b> the average category regarding susceptibility represented a 52, 09 % area and 9, 52 % corresponded to high susceptibility area.

This paper evaluated the effect of land use and occupation in Banguelo Creek on its water quality, considering the seasonal cycle in several points of the <b>micro-basin.</b> The analyzed parameters for monitoring the water quality were: pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, phosphate, nitrate, total nitrogen, temperature, BOD 5, COD and thermotolerant coliforms. The results were analyzed based on a floristic survey and on land occupation conditions in the <b>micro-basin.</b> Water quality index (WQINSF) was calculated and the points with the highest degree of pollution were identified. Analysis of WQI indicated that the water quality fell in the classes “average” and “bad” during dry season, with improvement for “good” and “average” in the rainy season. The deterioration of water quality was attributed to the discharge of industrial effluent and sewage that caused low levels of dissolved oxygen, high concentration of organic matter and nutrients. In areas with vegetation, a decrease in the concentrations of pollutants (mainly nitrate and phosphate) was observed, indicating the importance of maintaining riparian vegetation to improve the water quality in the region. The decrease in the pollution level of this creek could improve the water quality in the region, contributing to the eutrophication reduction of Pampulha reservoir...|$|E
40|$|Poster presentado en el 2 nd SCARCE Annual Conference celebrado en Madrid el 28 y 29 de noviembre de 2011 Overland flow {{generation}} {{within the}} same basin is dependent on different factors that facilitate sectors connectivity and flow concentration. Dominant factors (climatic, topographic, ecologic, etc.) {{may not be the}} same according to the area size and hence their interaction is dependent on scale (drainage area size) and dimensions (rainfall intensity and duration). Hydrological connectivity is also behind of the subsequent process of erosion, which is understood as a major threat in Mediterranean semiarid ecosystems due to vegetation scarcity. Surface water connection will determine the existence of erosion production, transport and accumulation inside and outside the basin. If hydrological connectivity may produce also erosion connectivity, soil depletion and loss of soil capacity to sustain plants will be undesirable consequences producing the final degradation of soils and increasing the risk of desertification. In this work a methodology to study overland flow generation and sediment (erosion) yield has been developed in the Portacoeli experimental <b>micro-basin</b> nested in the greater Barranc the Carraixet watershed in the proximity of the city of Valencia, Spain. Hydrological connectivity and response to rainfall events has been analysed at three scales: (1) The greater Barranc the Carraixet watershed, (2) the <b>micro-basin</b> (both instrumented with automatic flow records) and (3) seven experimental plots, four under controlled conditions with different vegetation cover and three under natural conditions. Erosion response related to rainfall events and overland flow was studied in all experimental plots. The analysis has been applied to a one year records of rainfall, overland flow and sediment data, from April 2008 to March 2009. Results show that scale is a key element to establish flows concentration and hence connectivity. There is an exponential relationship between the size of the draining area and flow production, regardless of the type of cover. Nonetheless, at plot scale the type of vegetation cover has influence on overland flow production where open spaces with bare soil spaces may be crucial to organized water connections through some slope sectors. Other factor as topography and lithology (e. g. areas of rock outcrops) may result relevant to <b>micro-basin</b> scale where slope sectors connectivity has to be overcome. To greater scale, major landscape or land cover units together with anthropogenic and meteorological characteristics have to be considered to produce concentrated flow. In fact no record has been registered at the watershed (Barranc de Carraixet) scales during more than ten years. At plot scale erosion has been scarcely produced. Of the total 26 rainfall events recorded very few were identified as erosive, and in all cases with very small amounts mainly obtained under natural conditions. Such results suggest that erosion connectivity, when exists, may be produced at slope scale and further incorporated to concentrated flow at the <b>micro-basin</b> scale. The absence of flow registers to the watershed scale suggests that the small proportion of sediments conveyed at <b>micro-basin</b> scale may not abandon such scale unit being redistributed internally without further connections.

40|$|AbstractUnderstanding the {{influence}} of local and regional factors that structure biological communities {{can be useful in}} environmental conservation. Our objective was to verify whether a fish metacommunity in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest has a nonrandom structure along the longitudinal stream gradient. To do so, we applied the elements of metacommunity structure to examine fish distribution patterns at the <b>micro-basin</b> extent for 20 stream fish assemblages. Stream fish species were independently distributed following the Gleasonian pattern. The Gleasonian pattern suggested that the communities varied continuously over space, potentially reflecting the degree to which species tolerances overlap. The metacommunity structure may have resulted from the environmental gradient and has a high beta diversity. The upstream reaches have higher values from regional variables (confluence distance and declivity) and slower values on variables representing a local scale (temperature, conductivity, depth, and width). Knowing the type of structure and the drivers that shape a metacommunity, we suggested that ensuring the connectivity of streams is a good conservation strategy as the species move from one to another, being very dependent on the colonization source. This environmental management can affect biodiversity at local and regional scales, thus we would require devoting local conservation efforts to a large number of different reaches of streams and in a <b>micro-basin</b> regional scale...|$|E

O estudo mineralógico permitiu identificar os principais minerais que ocorrem nos solos, principalmente, minerais interestratificados expansivos com características vérticas, que imprimem aos pedoambientes elementos peculiares para a Amazônia Ocidental. Este tipo de argila associada aos sedimentos psamíticos, aceleram os processos erosivos e retardam os pedogenéticos.

An extensive tectonic regime that occurred in northern Tunisia during this period was oriented NE-SW nearby E-W faults including those bordering the southern part of the Atlas basin. This controlled the gradual collapse of the “Tunisian Furrow” by the subsidence and tilting blocks in an E-W orientation (Figs.  1 c, 2 b). A half-graben structure generated sedimentary <b>micro-basins,</b> created at subsiding blocks, characterized by thick sedimentary prisms on the collapsed side of normal faults.

The raised edges of these <b>micro-basins</b> show mismatches and breaches of dismantling (Martinez et al. 1991; Ellouz 1984; Chikhaoui and Turki 1995).

Recent studies suggest that for a better understanding of runoff generation, aspects such as scale and water paths and connectivity should be approached. In this work, the rainfall-runoff conversion is analysed taking in consideration the contributing area and hydrological connectivity. Within the same basin, the Barranc del Carraixet, in eastern Spain, near the city of Valencia, it has been selected three scales of work: four experimental plots (8 x 40 m), <b>micro-basin</b> (17. 01 ha) and small drainage basin (127. 9 km 2). Data used consists in rainfall and runoff values recorded during twelve month (from 1 April 2008 to 31 march, 2009). For the analysis of runoff generation at the different scales rainfall thresholds and runoff rates and thresholds were used. For hydrological connectivity, at plot level, coefficients of determination were analysed. Results show the importance of scale in flow generation with increasing rainfall thresholds as the draining area becomes larger. In addition, the number of runoff and flow records diminished with scale. In the studied period it has been registered 26 rainfall events, 15 of which (66 %) produced runoff at plot scale, only three registered flow at <b>micro-basin</b> scale, and none was recorded at watershed level. Inverse relationship is given between the volume of runoff and recurrence, with increasing scale. Connectivity, at plot level, is variable, increasing the R 2 according the simplification of processes, when the interference of vegetation decreases, establishing better linearity between rain and surface flow.

30|$|Intensive rainfall, livestock, {{and land}} use {{processes}} can damage the physical {{soil and water conservation}} structures such as soil bunds, stone bunds, fanya juus, trenches, and <b>micro-basins.</b> Therefore, it requires frequent removal of sediment from channel and other maintenance activities. In micro-watersheds of Soresha and Sadoye kebeles where management activities occur on common land, the maintenance work is undertaken by the community through labor investment or safety net program support. On individually owned land, structures built by the public campaign are expected to be maintained by the owners. Through field observations and discussions with key informants, it was determined that most of the land owners in Kota Kombola, Ha’amancho, Megere and Zobecho kebeles are both undertaking the normal maintenance work and also strengthening the structures (soil bunds and fanya juus) with ‘desho’ grass (Pennisetum pedicellatum). In Angacha and Damboye wereda, good interest for repairing the structures was observed with 86 % of respondents willing to maintain the conservation practices by investing family labor and the remaining 14 % preferring to wait for external support.|$|R

40|$|The {{southern}} {{region of}} Santa Catarina {{has been the}} subject of academic research since the nineties. A majority are related to the exploration of coal mines and its implication on the environmental degradation of the soils and hydric resources. The microbasin of the Maior River does not have favorable conditions for coal deposit to occur, even though it is included in the Geomorphologic Depressed Unit of the Carboniferous Zone of Santa Catarina. In this way, the deterioration of the in the Maior river is product of the relation between the society and nature. The an tropical alterations in the natural environment occurs in accordance with the physical characteristics of the place (climate, relief, vegetation, soil, as well as the sociocultural level, technological capacity and the economic resources of the population (Ross, 1992). It is in the natural environments where the human societies structure themselves; extract the resources for survival and organization of physical territorial space (op. cit). The environmental deterioration in the <b>micro-basin</b> of the Maior River has direct relation to the occupation and use of the land for cultural purposes since the end of the nineteenth century. The colonization of the region began with the establishment of a headquarters for the colony of Urussanga, on May 26 th 1878 (Escaravaco, 1984). The residing population at Maior River is predominantly 3 rd to 5 th generation Italian descendants. The microbasin of the Maior River has two sites: The Maior river line and the Maior River. The first immigrants came from the mountainous region of northern Italy (Escaravaco, 1984) ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{takes in}} stock of {{research}} {{results from a}} project on integrated water and forest management in a <b>micro-basin</b> of Gandaki River System in Nepal. The paper demonstrates that while the results on the ground has been laudable, much more efforts are needed to consolidate the gains and to seize {{the window of opportunity}} provided by the strongly and rapidly evolving community-based natural resource management institutions in the country that can contribute to positive policy reform, build synergy and enhance the capacities of local institutions communities to pursue integrated resource management for unleashing the country’s potentials to fulfill and exceed MDG targets and reduce poverty. From the information obtained through participatory action research, the paper explains that while abject poverty and chronic deprivations are visible, community-resource management equation has been rather favorable. Despite the positives of community-based institutions, their strong emergence has neither resulted in consistent poverty reduction nor has created the fundamentals for the equity-based institutional development. Nepal was also under armed-conflict {{for more than a decade}} until recently which seriously undermined community based institutions’ efforts on poverty reduction, economic and social progress. Furthermore, the tradition of isolated community driven initiatives or institutional arrangement continues to override the overall essence carried by integrated community-led natural resource management. This clearly demands a re-think on long-held tradition of isolated community-based management actions for natural resources such as water and forest resources. It is also a pointer to the urgency of strengthening local government institutions and local community institutions to identify, plan and implement local level management actions for reducing inter-institutional disparities for achievement of poverty reduction targets and achievement of MDG outcomes...|$|E
40|$|The {{profitability}} of hydropower in Costa Rica {{is affected by}} soil erosion and sedimentation in dam reservoirs, which are in turn influenced by land use, infiltration and aquifer interactions with surface water. In order to foster the provision and payment for Hydrological Environmental Services (HES), a quantitative assessment {{of the impact of}} specific land uses on the functioning of drainage-basins is required. The present paper aims to study the water balance partitioning in a volcanic coffee agroforestry <b>micro-basin</b> (1 km 2, steep slopes) in Costa Rica, as a first step towards evaluating sediment or contaminant loads. The main hydrological processes were monitored during one year, using flume, eddy-covariance flux tower, soil water profiles and piezometers. A new Hydro-SVAT lumped model is proposed, that balances SVAT (Soil Vegetation Atmosphere Transfer) and basin-reservoir routines. The purpose of such a coupling was to achieve a trade-off between the expected performance of ecophysiological and hydrological models, which are often employed separately and at different spatial scales, either the plot or the basin. The calibration of the model to perform streamflow yielded a Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) coefficient equal to 0. 89 for the year 2009, while the validation of the water balance partitioning was consistent with the independent measurements of actual evapotranspiration (R 2 = 0. 79, energy balance closed independently), soil water content (R 2 = 0. 35) and water table level (R 2 = 0. 84). Eight months of data from 2010 were used to validate modelled streamflow, resulting in a NS = 0. 75. An uncertainty analysis showed that the streamflow modelling was precise for nearly every time step, while a sensitivity analysis revealed which parameters mostly affected model precision, depending on the season. It was observed that 64...|$|E

Two methods were applied for the delimitation of the basins: (a) proposed by Otto Pfasftetter that has allowed to delineate basins and interbasin to level 7 and (b) the method based on Strahler methodology which helped to identify the watersheds, sub-basins and <b>micro-basins</b> on greater detail, for both methods was considered the criteria for classification and codification of international standards for watershed delineation recognized worldwide. To achieve the objective of delineation watersheds was generated mapping of support, so it was necessary generate contours from digital elevation models of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and fill the gaps for non-coating aerial photography in the official national sheet map, and then generating a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in more detail, and later model of Shadows (Hillshade), hierarchy order of rivers, etc. As a result we have the demarcation of watersheds by Strahler and Pfasftetter methods and total area of 222, 146. 952 km 2 and 219, 982. 197 km 2 respectively, approximately 17 % of the area of Peru.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} the trophic structure of the fish assemblage in streams of the Serra Japi, an ecotonal area between the Atlantic Forest and inland forests of São Paulo State, Southeastern Brazil. Fish were collected with electrofishing equipment in 15 sites covering different regions, substrate types and riparian vegetation, distributed throughout the Caguaçú River, Caxambú, Piraí and Guapeva River <b>micro-basins,</b> during the rainy (January/February) and dry season (June) of 2007. The 589 specimens analyzed from 22 species, were assigned to different trophic groups, discriminated through a matrix of similarity, based on the food index (IAi). The results show the formation of seven groups with a predominance of insectivorous and omnivorous species, followed by detritivores, piscivores, omnivore-carnivores and herbivores, which consumed mostly items of autochthonous origin, where algae and young insects were dominant. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), correlating the biomass of trophic groups to environmental variables, showed that omnivores, insectivores and omnivore-carnivores displayed a wide distribution, while detritivores, herbivores and piscivores were restricted to specific locations, related to different physical and chemical variables as total nitrogen, conductivity and temperature. Despite the increase in total biomass at the most urbanized sites, {{the results indicate that}} the streams maintain a diverse community, suggesting that most of them are in preserved conditions...|$|R
