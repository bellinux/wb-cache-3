The gorget patch and the stand-up collar showed the particular Waffenfarbe (en: corps colour).|$|E
5000|$|The boot {{is usually}} placed onto the horse with the straps facing towards the rear {{on the outside}} of the leg, unless the {{attachment}} design mandates a different placement. To ensure there is even pressure around the leg when putting the boot on, they are fastened <b>middle</b> <b>strap</b> first, then the others. Boots that are too tight can cause discomfort and pressure injuries, but those that are too loose may become dislodged or come off entirely.|$|E
40|$|Excessively large lips {{represent}} an occasional but significant challenge in aesthetic surgery. Previously described techniques focus {{largely on the}} simple excision of a strip of tissue to reduce the lips, without specific attention to the resultant lip contour or to the volume relationship between the lips. The present paper describes a new technique for lip reduction, called the ‘bikini lip reduction’. This technique not only reduces {{the volume of the}} lips, but also restores an attractive labial contour, as well as an ideal volume relationship between the upper and lower lips. Because it is based on aesthetic analysis, this technique consistently yields both smaller and more aesthetically appealing lips. Simply stated, the bikini lip reduction consists of excision of a ‘bikini top’ (two cups and a <b>middle</b> <b>strap)</b> from the upper lip and a ‘bikini bottom’ (a triangle) from the lower lip. The aesthetic results and the patient satisfaction achieved through the bikini lip reduction technique have been very satisfactory...|$|E

5000|$|Once the K.E.D. is {{slid into}} position, it is secured {{to the victim}} with straps {{in order to prevent}} movement. The first strap that is secured is the <b>middle</b> torso <b>strap.</b> According to the K.E.D. users' manual {{securing}} this strap secures the greatest area of the device and therefore provides the greatest stability while securing the rest of the device. Next the bottom torso strap is secured, however the top torso strap is not secured until just prior to moving the patient to the long spine board. This is to allow the patient to breathe easily {{while the rest of the}} device is secured. Following the bottom torso strap the leg straps are secured. These may be applied in a [...] "criss-cross" [...] fashion (according to the K.E.D. users' manual this is the most commonly used method), or applied by securing them to their respective sides. If there is any evidence of a groin injury the [...] "criss-cross" [...] method cannot be used. Following application of the leg straps the void between the head and device is padded as needed and the head is secured. Finally, just prior to moving the patient to a long spine board the top strap is secured. Some schools teach this order by remembering the phrase [...] "My Baby Looks Hot Tonight", [...] "Money Buys Lots of Hot Toys" [...] or [...] "Maori Boys Love Hairy Teke", where the beginning of each word stands for <b>Middle</b> torso <b>strap,</b> Bottom torso strap, Leg straps, Head strap and Top torso strap.|$|R
60|$|The other {{prominent}} figure {{was that of}} Richard Crickett, the parish clerk, a kind of Bowdlerized rake, who ate {{only as much as}} a woman, and had the rheumatism in his left hand. The remainder of the group, brown-faced peasants, wore smock-frocks embroidered on the shoulders with hearts and diamonds, and were girt round their <b>middle</b> with a <b>strap,</b> another being worn round the right wrist.|$|R

The sculpture was refabricated after inscribing on the base.The sculpture coating was worked under Sahiddullah Associates and the sculpture base was designed by architect Rabioul Hossain.It is a sculpture of the three figures,the central character, a village youth stands in the <b>middle</b> clutching the <b>strap</b> of a rifle {{in his hand and}} a grenade in the left [...] To the left of him is an urban youth with a rifle [...] At the right is a young lady devoted to nursing with a first aid box at her shoulder.These three represent the concerted strength of the whole Bengali nation.|$|R
60|$|He was a {{very sick}} white man. He rode pick-a-back on a woolly-headed, black-skinned savage, the lobes of whose ears had been pierced and {{stretched}} until one had torn out, while the other carried a circular block of carved wood three inches in diameter. The torn ear had been pierced again, but this time not so ambitiously, for the hole accommodated {{no more than a}} short clay pipe. The man-horse was greasy and dirty, and naked save for an exceedingly narrow and dirty loin-cloth; but the white man clung to him closely and desperately. At times, from weakness, his head drooped and rested on the woolly pate. At other times he lifted his head and stared with swimming eyes at the cocoanut palms that reeled and swung in the shimmering heat. He was clad in a thin undershirt and a strip of cotton cloth, that wrapped about his waist and descended to his knees. On his head was a battered Stetson, known to the trade as a Baden-Powell. About his <b>middle</b> was <b>strapped</b> a belt, which carried a large-calibred automatic pistol and several spare clips, loaded and ready for quick work.|$|R
60|$|He {{went down}} the ladder, but Kit clung to the rails. He had not a job; his part was played when he urged Don Erminio to steer for the land, and now {{as he watched the}} white seas curl and break he knew his rashness. The steamer's course was a zig-zag; with the savage wind on her quarter, her bows swerved about. All Miguel could do was to let one {{divergence}} balance the other. In front was an ominous white crescent, running back into the dark, but broken by a gap in the <b>middle.</b> A man, <b>strapped</b> outside the bridge, hove the lead, but this was an obvious formality, because if he got shallow water Mossamedes could not steam out. If Miguel tried to bring her round, she would drive, broadside on, against the hammered sands.|$|R
50|$|After {{the strap}} is tensioned, the strap is often sealed to itself. Steel strap is sealed with a seal and notch joint, a seal and crimp, seal-less joint, or via welding. Seals come in various shapes {{depending}} on the application; some can be put on after the strap is tensioned, while others must be installed before tensioning. To create the seal, the seal and strap are notched on both sides; if one set of notches are created then it is called a single notch joint, if two sets of notches are created then it is called a double notch joint. Crimp joints also use a seal, but crimp undulations are used instead of formed notches. These crimps form great frictional forces which keep the joint from seeping. Seal-less joints are created by forming interlocking keys into the <b>middle</b> of the <b>strap.</b>|$|R
50|$|A carrier {{shoulder}} strap is {{a length of}} fabric or other flexible material (such as leather, vinyl, rubber), used to suspend an item, often of some weight, from the shoulder(s). The strap may be worn slung over one shoulder or across the body. In the interest of comfort, they often have some manner of padding near the <b>middle,</b> where the <b>strap</b> rests directly against the shoulder or neck. Such items include purses, guitars, rifles, etc. In the case of rifles and other such weaponry, the {{shoulder strap}} is usually {{referred to as a}} sling. Shoulder straps may also be used in pairs on such items as a backpack or a baby carrier; the straps are worn one over each shoulder, and the item so carried is centred on the back or chest. Some camera strap manufacturers, such as BlackRapid, design their straps to fit over both shoulders allowing two cameras to rest at hip level.|$|R

The results demonstrated that: (1) Regions of interest with high NDVI indices were distributed primarily in forested mountainous regions of {{the east and the}} north, areas with low NDVI indices were primarily distributed in the Gobi desert regions of the west and the southwest, and areas with moderate NDVI values were mainly distributed in a <b>middle</b> steppe <b>strap</b> from northwest to southeast. (2) The maximum NDVI values maintained for the past 22 years showed little variation. The average NDVI variance coefficient for the 22 -year period was 15. 2 %. (3) NDVI distribution and vegetation cover showed spatial autocorrelations on a global scale. NDVI patterns from the vegetation cover also demonstrated anisotropy; a higher positive spatial correlation was indicated in a NW-SE direction, which suggested that vegetation cover in a NW-SE direction maintained increased integrity, and vegetation assemblage was mainly distributed in the same specific direction. (4) The NDVI spatial distribution was mainly controlled by structural factors, 88. 7 % of the total spatial variation was influenced by structural and 11. 3 % by random factors. And the global autocorrelation distance was 1178 km, and the average vegetation patch length (NW-SE) to width (NE-SW) ratio was approximately 2. 4 : 1. 0...|$|R
60|$|Arrived {{within the}} wall, {{we found the}} usual village sights and life. We moved along a narrow, crooked lane which had been paved in the <b>Middle</b> Ages. A <b>strapping,</b> ruddy girl was beating flax or some such stuff {{in a little bit}} of a good-box of a barn, and she swung her flail with a will--if it was a flail; I was not farmer enough to know what she was at; a frowsy, barelegged girl was herding half a dozen geese with a stick--driving them along the lane and keeping them out of the dwellings; a cooper was at work in a shop which I know he did not make so large a thing as a {{hogshead}} in, for there was not room. In the front rooms of dwellings girls and women were cooking or spinning, and ducks and chickens were waddling in and out, over the threshold, picking up chance crumbs and holding pleasant converse; a very old and wrinkled man sat asleep before his door, with his chin upon his breast and his extinguished pipe in his lap; soiled children were playing in the dirt everywhere along the lane, unmindful of the sun.|$|R
5000|$|Soon {{after its}} recommissioning, the ECW World Heavyweight Championship belt design was updated to a design {{similar to the}} belt used prior to ECW's {{original}} closure in 2001, which featured a black leather strap with a snakeskin pattern on the rear, snaps to wrap around the waist of the wrestler who wore it, and five pieces made of gold. In the <b>middle</b> of the <b>strap</b> was a large center piece, which featured a design of a blue globe in the center, {{and to the left}} and right of the globe were a pair of baseball bats wrapped in barbed wire. At the top of the piece, a purple ECW logo and the words [...] "World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion" [...] were engraved with the words [...] "Heavyweight Wrestling" [...] in red, which gave the text a blood-like appearance. In addition, the entire piece was engraved with a pattern similar to that of a steel cage. Along the strap, on both ends, were four smaller pieces which featured a design {{similar to that of the}} center piece. The new belt as of June 20, 2006 was differentiated by a full black strap with barbed wire tooling, red ECW logos, and the innards of the steel cage pattern outlined in black.|$|R
50|$|Its {{ensemble}} {{consisted of}} a nylon pack with a cinch cord, top flap and three exterior pockets and a tubular aluminum frame with padded shoulder straps and waist belt. The Lightweight Rucksack, Nylon, OG106 (FSN 8465-782-3248) was developed in 1962 {{as a part of}} the United States Army's efforts to develop suitable equipment for use by Special Forces, long-range reconnaissance patrols, and mountain and arctic troops. Testing was conducted by the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne) in Alaska and Panama Canal Zone. Four different patterns of the lightweight rucksack exist, with the latter two models featuring attachment points which allow the pack itself to be mounted in two and three different locations on the frame, respectively. A prototype rucksack was produced in 1962, featuring a welded frame. The 1964 model was virtually the same, but with the contract information stamped in the pack rather than sewn in on a label. The next improvement came along in 1965, when the frame was changed to a riveted version rather than a welded one. The last modification was made in 1968, with the addition of a <b>middle</b> horizontal back <b>strap.</b> In South Vietnam the lightweight rucksack replaced and augmented the M1956 and M1961 versions of combat packs and was later partially replaced by the tropical rucksack of the M1967 MLCE (Designed specifically for jungle warfare). The rucksack was typically mounted low on the frame allowing bulky equipment to be strapped above. Stocks of lightweight rucksacks were replaced in United States military service beginning in 1974 with the adoption of the ALICE equipment. Lightweight rucksacks are currently quite desirable among collectors and period reenactors alike, and often retail for anywhere between $250 and $350 USD at dedicated militaria dealers and online auctions.|$|R
