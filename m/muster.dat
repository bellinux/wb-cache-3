5|$|Daily life at Fort Greble {{was similar}} to that {{experienced}} by soldiers at other forts in the Washington defenses. A soldier's normal day began with reville before sunrise and was immediately followed by morning <b>muster,</b> at which the soldiers of the garrison were counted and reported for sick call. Following <b>muster,</b> the day was filled with work on improving the fort's defenses and drill of various types, usually consisting of gunnery practice, but also including infantry and parade drill. This schedule usually continued, broken by meal and rest breaks, until taps was called at 8:00 or 9:00p.m. Sunday was a break in the routine as the <b>muster</b> was immediately followed by a weekly inspection and church call. Sunday afternoons were a soldier's free time, and this was usually filled by writing letters home, bathing, or simply catching up on extra sleep.|$|E
