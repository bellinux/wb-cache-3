5|$|Valve added Steam Guard {{functionality}} to the Steam {{client in}} March 2011 {{to protect against}} the hijacking of accounts via phishing schemes, one of the largest support issues Valve had at the time. Steam Guard was advertised {{to take advantage of the}} identity protection provided by Intel's second-generation Core processors and compatible motherboard hardware, which allows users to lock their account to a specific computer. Once locked, activity by that account on other computers must first be approved by the user on the locked computer. Support APIs for Steam Guard are available to third-party developers through Steamworks. Steam Guard also offers two-factor, risk-based authentication that uses a one-time verification code sent to a verified email address associated with the Steam account; this was later expanded to include two-factor authentication through the Steam <b>mobile</b> <b>application,</b> known as Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator. If Steam Guard is enabled, the verification code is sent each time the account is used from an unknown machine.|$|E

40|$|<b>Mobile</b> <b>applications</b> are {{becoming}} more common {{as the number of}} mobile devices grows. For these devices {{there are a number of}} operating systems that run applications that have been made for them. Implementing an application for multiple platforms has commonly required creating multiple implementations in order to run the application on each of the desired platforms. This has lead to the development of cross-platform <b>mobile</b> <b>applications,</b> which allow writing one implementation that can be used for multiple platforms. In this thesis, the intent is to evaluate if there are tools for automating testing cross-platform <b>mobile</b> <b>applications,</b> that are viable for using for testing <b>mobile</b> <b>applications</b> developed by Dicode Ltd. The tool used for developing cross-platform <b>mobile</b> <b>applications</b> is PhoneGap. This thesis evaluates three available tools for testing cross-platform <b>mobile</b> <b>applications.</b> The target platforms in this evaluation are Android and iOS.

40|$|The {{reliability}} {{and security of}} a software application {{are two of the}} most important software quality characteristics because they describe the ability of the software to run without failures and to protect user data. <b>Mobile</b> <b>applications</b> concur with desktop applications in terms of rich interfaces and functionalities and are becoming one the most used type of software applications. Based on the “anytime, anywhere” paradigm, <b>mobile</b> <b>applications</b> must provide special measures to avoid failures and to preserve a high level of {{reliability and}} security because mobile operating systems provide limited or none access to administrative or system tools that will allow a user with an IT background to access temporary or persistent data. A high level of software reliability is directly influenced by a low level of failures.
