5|$|Deeply {{shocked and}} {{upset by the}} accident, Wilbur {{determined}} to <b>make</b> <b>even</b> more impressive flight demonstrations; in the ensuing days and weeks he set new records for altitude and duration. In January 1909 Orville and Katharine joined him in France, {{and for a time}} they were the three most famous people in the world, sought after by royalty, the rich, reporters and the public. The kings of Great Britain, Spain and Italy came to see Wilbur fly.|$|E

Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have emulated this capability by creating a textured surface that combines alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic materials.|$|E

5|$|Even though Lanley {{succeeds in}} winning over {{almost the entire}} town, his salesmanship fails to {{convince}} Marge, who is frustrated with the town's purchase because she (correctly) believes the monorail is unsafe and that Lanley is a conman. While watching TV, Homer sees an advertisement that suggests he attend Lanley's institute of monorail conducting, which is a transparent effort to <b>make</b> <b>even</b> more money from the con. Homer immediately decides to enroll. After a three-week course, Lanley selects Homer at random from among his classmates to be the monorail conductor.|$|E
25|$|On further reflection, the Meditator {{realizes that}} even simple {{things can be}} doubted. Omnipotent God could <b>make</b> <b>even</b> our {{conception}} of mathematics false. One might argue that God is supremely good and would not lead him to believe falsely all these things. But by this reasoning we should think that God would not deceive him with regard to anything, and yet this is clearly not true. If we suppose there is no God, then there is even greater likelihood of being deceived, since our imperfect senses {{would not have been}} created by a perfect being.|$|E

25|$|Drummer Mason was {{replaced}} by Mike Clark, and the band released a second album, Thrust, the following year, 1974. (A live album from a Japan performance, consisting of compositions from those first two Head Hunters releases was released in 1975 as Flood.) This was almost as well received as its predecessor, if not attaining {{the same level of}} commercial success. The Headhunters made another successful album called Survival of the Fittest in 1975 without Hancock, while Hancock himself started to <b>make</b> <b>even</b> more commercial albums, often featuring members of the band, but no longer billed as The Headhunters. The Headhunters reunited with Hancock in 1998 for Return of the Headhunters, and a version of the band (featuring Jackson and Clark) continues to play and record.|$|E
25|$|Social critics {{complain}} that sweatshop workers {{often do not}} earn {{enough money to buy}} the products that they <b>make,</b> <b>even</b> though such items are often commonplace goods such as T-shirts, shoes, and toys. In 2003, Honduran garment factory workers were paid US$0.24 for each $50 Sean John sweatshirt, $0.15 for each long-sleeved T-shirt, and only five cents for each short-sleeved shirt – less than one-half of one percent of the retail price. Even comparing international costs of living, the $0.15 that a Honduran worker earned for the long-sleeved T-shirt was equal in purchasing power to $0.50 in the United States. In countries where labor costs are low, bras that cost US$5–7 apiece retail for US$50 or more in American stores. , female garment workers in Sri Lanka earned about US$2.20 per day.|$|E
25|$|As Part Two begins, it {{is assumed}} that the literate classes of Spain have all read {{the first part of the}} story. Cervantes's meta-fictional device was to <b>make</b> <b>even</b> the {{characters}} in the story familiar with the publication of Part One, as well as with an actually published, fraudulent Part Two. When strangers encounter the duo in person, they already know their famous history. A Duke and Duchess, and others, deceive Don Quixote for entertainment, setting forth a string of imagined adventures resulting in a series of practical jokes. Some of them put Don Quixote's sense of chivalry and his devotion to Dulcinea through many tests. Pressed into finding Dulcinea, Sancho brings back three ragged peasant girls and tells Don Quixote that they are Dulcinea and her ladies-in-waiting. When Don Quixote only sees the peasant girls, Sancho pretends (reversing some incidents of Part One) that their derelict appearance results from an enchantment.|$|E

500|$|AllMusic writer K. Ross Hoffman {{declared}} the record an [...] "entirely satisfying display" [...] of Lindstrøm's talents and positively {{commented on the}} textured instrumentation. Hoffman concluded the music was an [...] "expansive, exploratory journey" [...] worth experiencing. Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club disagreed, believing the album to be narrow minded and a missed opportunity to exploit the lengthy tracks and deliver more musical depth. Praise was given by Alex Macpherson of The Guardian, who stated [...] "Every aspect of the record seems tailor-made to produce maximum pleasure [...] Where You Go I Go Too would <b>make</b> <b>even</b> the most hellish of journeys seem like a first-class trip." ...|$|E

500|$|Other {{characteristics}} of the painting are the unadorned dress, in which the eyes and hands have no competition from other details, the dramatic landscape background in which the world {{seems to be in}} a state of flux, the subdued colouring, and the extremely smooth nature of the painterly technique, employing oils laid on much like tempera and blended on the surface so that the brushstrokes are indistinguishable. Vasari expressed the opinion that the manner of painting would <b>make</b> <b>even</b> [...] "the most confident master... despair and lose heart." [...] The perfect state of preservation and {{the fact that there is}} no sign of repair or overpainting is rare in a panel painting of this date.|$|E
500|$|... 2012 was marketed by {{the fictional}} Institute for Human Continuity, {{featuring}} {{a book by}} Jackson Curtis (Farewell Atlantis), streaming media, blog updates and radio broadcasts from zealot Charlie Frost on his website, This Is The End. On November12,2008, the studio released the first trailer for 2012. With a tsunami surging over the Himalayas and a purportedly-scientific message {{that the world would}} end in 2012, the trailer's message was that international governments were not preparing their populations for the event. The trailer ended with a suggestion to viewers to [...] "find out the truth" [...] by entering [...] "2012" [...] on a search engine. The Guardian called the film's marketing [...] "deeply flawed", associating it with [...] "websites that <b>make</b> <b>even</b> more spurious claims about 2012".|$|E
500|$|Joseph Bertin {{wrote in}} his 1735 {{textbook}} The Noble Game of Chess, [...] "He that plays first, is understood to have the attack." [...] This {{is consistent with the}} traditional view that White, by virtue of the first move, begins with the initiative and should try to extend it into the middlegame, while Black should strive to neutralize White's initiative and attain equality. Because White begins with the initiative, a minor mistake by White generally leads only to loss of the initiative, while a similar mistake by Black may have more serious consequences. Thus, Sveshnikov wrote in 1994, [...] "Black players cannot afford to <b>make</b> <b>even</b> the slightest mistake ... from a theoretical point of view, the tasks of White and Black in chess are different: White has to strive for a win, Black—for a draw!" ...|$|E

500|$|Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also lauded {{the three}} {{principal}} actors' achievements, especially Radcliffe: [...] "One of {{the joys of}} this film is watching Daniel Radcliffe grow so impressively {{into the role of}} Harry.

Rolling Stones review also classified the film as better than the previous four instalments in the series, by losing the [...] "candy-ass aspect" [...] of the first two and [...] "raising the bar" [...] from the [...] "heat and resonance" [...] of the third and fourth. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called the film [...] "the best of the series so far, [...] the laughs, the jitters and the juice to <b>make</b> <b>even</b> nonbelievers wild about Harry".|$|E
