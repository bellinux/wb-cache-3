Another {{study showed that}} bismuth acted synergistically with various {{antibiotics}} to inhibit sulfate-reducing gut bacteria and sulfide production. Some authors proposed a theory that H2S {{was involved in the}} development of ulcerative colitis and that bismuth <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> in the management of this condition. However, bismuth administration in rats did not prevent them from developing ulcerative colitis despite reduced H2S production. Also, new evidence suggests that colonic H2S is largely present in bound forms, probably sulfides of iron and other metals. Rarely, serious bismuth toxicity may occur with higher doses.|$|E

Shatner said that another reason they decided to make the film was because Nimoy was visibly getting old. Shatner asked Nimoy if {{he would be willing to}} discuss his experiences with alcoholism in the film, and Nimoy agreed.

2500|$|Wittenberg {{wrote that}} Homosexualities was certain {{to become an}} instant classic and that it fully {{deserved}} this status. Morin described the book as a [...] "long-awaited publication", but did not consider its authors' findings surprising. Morin wrote that Bell and Weinberg appeared to have found [...] "difficulty {{in dealing with the}} diversity of experiences that they found among their gay respondents". While appreciating Bell and Weinberg's attempts to discredit stereotypes about homosexuals, he found their division of homosexuals into different [...] "types" [...] to be in effect {{the creation of a new}} set of stereotypes. He called Bell and Weinberg's typology of homosexuals [...] "arbitrary and misleading." [...] Morin argued that while Homosexualities was a [...] "fine historical document", its data only reflected the situation in San Francisco in 1969 and 1970. He denied that Bell and Weinberg had a representative sample, suggesting that a representative sample of homosexuals was impossible given that they were [...] "basically an invisible population". He accused Bell and Weinberg of drawing [...] "conclusions well beyond their data." [...] Overall, Morin considered Homosexualities a helpful work, and useful on a political level, but not [...] "a sophisticated research study". He wrote that the book was [...] "disappointing and consistent with the downward trend in the quality of reports emanating from the Institute for Sex Research", and criticized Bell and Weinberg for ignoring [...] "issues of growth and the ways in which diversity may lead to insights which <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> to all men and women exploring the creative violation of sex roles." ...|$|E

That good lady was a staunch ally and able assistant of many city missionaries, and did much service in the way of bringing them into acquaintance with people who she thought <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> to them, or get help from them.

60|$|I am chary {{nowadays}} {{of offering}} counsel {{in connection with}} subjects concerning which I am not and cannot be an authority. Long ago I once took upon myself to write a paper about babies. It did not aim to be a textbook on the subject. It did not even claim to exhaust the topic. I was willing that others, coming after me, should continue the argument--that is if, upon reflection, they were still of opinion there was anything more to be said. I {{was pleased with the}} article. I went {{out of my way to}} obtain an early copy of the magazine in which it appeared, on purpose to show it to a lady friend of mine.

60|$|Such {{recognition}} {{was always}} more precious than {{the reports of}} the conventional critics, though if these were favorable the author was glad of them, as of any good that the gods gave.

After all, as he said to himself, an author wrote for his readers and not for his critics, for pleasure and not for judgment; and if he could be assured publicly, as he sometimes was assured privately, that nothing he did was lost, he might be encouraged to keep on doing his best. Why, indeed, should not there be a critical journal embodying in a species of fragrant bouquet the flowers of thought and emotion springing up in the brains and bosoms of readers responsive to the influence of a new book? Such readers would have only to suppose themselves addressing the author direct, and the thing could be done. It might be done in another way by the authors contributing the praises privately sent him. In a time when personal letters to authors are constantly quoted in advertisements, this might not seem so immodest as in some earlier literary condition.|$|E
6000|$|I {{shall not}} go {{into the details of}} the {{procurement}} of {{what became known as the}} Riverside Franchise. In spite of the Maplewood residents, of the City Improvement League and individual protests, we obtained it with absurd ease. Indeed Perry Blackwood himself appeared before the Public Utilities Committee of the Board of Aldermen, and was listened to with deference and gravity while he discoursed on the defacement of a beautiful boulevard to satisfy the greed of certain private individuals. Mr. Otto Bitter and myself, who appeared for the petitioners, had a similar reception. That struggle was a tempest in a tea-pot. The reformer raged, but he was feeble in those days, and the great public believed what it read in the respectable newspapers. In Mr. Judah B. Tallant's newspaper, for instance, the Morning Era, there were semi-playful editorials about [...] "obstructionists." [...] Mr. Perry Blackwood was a well-meaning, able gentleman of an old family, etc., but with a sentiment for horse-cars. The Era published also the resolutions which (with interesting spontaneity!) had been passed by our Board of Trade and Chamber of Commerce and other influential bodies in favour of the franchise; the idea--unknown to the public--of Mr. Hugh Paret, who wrote drafts of the resolutions and suggested privately to Mr. Leonard Dickinson that a little enthusiasm from these organizations <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful.</b> Mr. Dickinson accepted the suggestion eagerly, wondering why he hadn't thought of it himself. The resolutions carried some weight with a public that did not know its right hand from its left.|$|E
