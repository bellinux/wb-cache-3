40|$|Abstract — Cloud Computing is transfiguring {{development}} {{of information technology}} industry by providing scalable services on a pay per use basis. Cloud hosts and consumers are tied with service level agreement (SLA). SLA provides description of services provided by the cloud host. A cloud host can serve to multiple consumers and this is called cloud computing <b>multi</b> <b>tenant</b> model. Though, cloud shows infinite capacity, still {{there must be some}} policy to maintain order of execution of users ’ tasks. Consumers can be served in a first come first serve, round robin or on a priority basis. This paper proposes a new leasing policy named CRI (Consumer Rating Index) and an algorithm for prioritizing consumers on the basis of CRI scores. Experimental results show that this policy and algorithm can be used for efficient functioning at cloud hosts side...|$|E
40|$|In today’s {{world of}} {{electronic}} payments, which includes credit cards, gift cards, stored value accounts, and micro payments on mobile devices, successful payment services {{need to be}} sufficiently scalable and support diverging use cases to be successful. However, the interaction between horizontal scalability, feature variability and stringent performance and security concerns for these heterogeneous payment applications and stakeholders is not always clear, which creates tension (and sometimes interference) in the successful development of these services. In this work, we identify crucial nonfunctional requirements for payment services and present a simple framework to map these requirements to existing approaches to achieve both horizontal and vertical scalability. We report on experiences with applying a service line engineering (SLE) approach towards payment services that combines cloud computing and SPL to support feature customization in a <b>multi</b> <b>tenant</b> payment service. We conclude with practical experiences and several lessons learned after applying this SPL engineering methodology on our industrial e-payment use case. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} Chapter is {{to review}} the range of {{emerging}} &# 039;cloud&# 039; marketing alternatives from dedicated private communication solutions through to <b>multi</b> <b>tenanted</b> public solutions ([1]Amrhein et al 2010; [33]Vaquero et al 2009; [2]Armbrust et al 2009). Cloud computing is a global trend which promises to be the single biggest growth area in ICT. Current estimates are that by 2020, approximately 14 % of all digital information will be stored in the cloud ([10]Gantz and Reinsel, 2010). Organizations are looking to cloud computing as a utility ([5]Buyya et al 2009) to lower ICT costs and boost effectiveness, and are seeking to move from fixed capital expenditure investments to variable operating expenses, using these resources to withstand seasonal peaks and for improved shareholder value. Cloud vendor organizations are developing so they are well placed {{to take advantage of}} this technology trend and the anticipated market growth. This requires investing in leading software and virtualised hardware so as to offer customers security, speed, lower costs and service reliability over high performance networks. Cloud computing is an evolving market opportunity for both customer and cloud vendor alike. However, in the development of cloud marketing strategies and campaigns there are significant risks for both vendor and consumer. These are discussed in this Chapter...|$|R
40|$|The study {{described}} in this article uses a random sample of households in the <b>Multi</b> family <b>Tenant</b> Characteristics System database and the Tenant Rental Assistance Certification System database to address the following questions: Does a significant difference exist in the mobility patterns of households {{in each of the three}} primary assisted housing programs? What household characteristics affect the probability of leaving assisted housing? The analysis shows that individual characteristics play an important role in determining assisted housing tenure, and significant differences in individual characteristics exist across the three primary assisted housing programs. The analysis also shows that location and neighborhood factors do affect household tenure in assisted housing programs. The results from this study clearly confirm that basic economic conditions play a significant role in determining whether a household stays or leaves an assisted housing program...|$|R
40|$|Cloud {{computing}} is a collective, optimized {{usage of}} IT resources {{which can be}} accessed from anywhere and performs the task of providing IT resources and services through various platforms as a service for users. Cloud users use different services of Cloud service providers and eventually end up keeping their data (in various forms) in cloud <b>multi</b> <b>tenant</b> environment. Multi-tenancy in cloud environment makes data vulnerable though with times different forms of threats and corresponding securities are already implemented in cloud environment. Although many of these services provide key functionality such as uploading and retrieving files by a precise user, more on going {{to the side of}} advanced services it offer features such as shared folders, real-time collaboration, and minimization of data transfers or unlimited storage space. As data is placed publically it require to search ways to protect the data from unauthorized access, files are uploaded publically and need to retrieve them securely with token ensuring possession proofs.

40|$|Fault {{tolerant}} {{systems are}} necessary {{to be there for}} distributed databases for data centers or distributed databases requires having fault tolerant system due to the higher data scales supported by current data centers. In a large distributed database usually data resides on servers which are dedicated servers having backups. Therefore, large amount of servers are used for this purpose. In this paper it is proposed that instead internet can be used as backbone where Infrastructure-as-a-service (Iaas) service of cloud can be used for storage servers. The advantage of this will be that storage location is abstracted and database can be accessed from anywhere. However while the storage allocation is abstracted it also brings in performance concerns in a <b>multi</b> <b>tenant</b> cloud environment where by most of the cloud consumers are geographically dispersed. Recent large Web applications make heavy use of distributed storage solutions {{in order to be able}} to scale up. Here we propose that static distributed database is spread over cloud making database dynamic. Keywords-distributed database; cloud; geo-redundancy; API...|$|E
40|$|Cloud {{computing}} infrastructures are {{the most}} recent ap- proach to the development and conception of computational systems. Cloud infrastructures are complex environments with various subsystems, each one with their own challenges. Cloud systems {{should be able to}} provide the following fun- damental property: elasticity. Elasticity is the ability to automatically add and remove instances according {{to the needs of the}} system. This is an requirement for pay-per-use billing models. Various open source software solutions allow companies and institutions to build their own Cloud infrastructure. How- ever, in most of these, the elasticity feature is quite imma- ture. Monitoring and timely adapting the active resources of a Cloud computing infrastructure is key to provide the elasticity required by diverse, <b>multi</b> <b>tenant</b> and pay-per-use business models. In this paper, we propose Elastack, an automated monitor- ing and adaptive system, generic enough to be applied to existing IaaS frameworks and intended to enable the elastic- ity they currently lack. Our approach offers any Cloud in- frastructure the mechanisms to implement automated mon- itoring and adaptation as well as the flexibility to go beyond these. We evaluate Elastack by integrating it with the Open- Stack and showing how easy it is to add these important features with a minimum, almost imperceptible, amount of modifications to the default installation...|$|E
40|$|Heading {{towards the}} next decade, a major {{paradigm}} shift {{has been observed}} {{in the way the}} software services are being provided to the enterprises and corporate sector. Corporations and enterprises are switching to www host applications being offered as a service by software vendors and on-premises LOB (Line of Business) applications are taking a toll back. SaaS (Software as a Service) is the new concept. Adapting of SaaS, however, requires that the applications which are being provided as a service should be generalized for users or groups of users and it would require a vast space to be allocated to user or user group. The users or user groups ordinarily correspond to a company or group of companies/businesses and are termed as tenants. In this regard, the architecture of SaaS applications needs to be customized to support certain characteristics — e. g., configurability, maintainability and scalability — to support high storage for hosting resources made available to diverse number of users. This paper, firstly, analyzes new trends in the present day business environment alongside the hardware and software industry that {{led to the development of}} SaaS model; and then looks into the characteristics and features that a storage pattern for <b>multi</b> <b>tenant</b> system in SaaS needs to possess in order to put this concept into practice...|$|E
40|$|This {{capstone}} project {{examined in}} detail {{some of the}} aspects of Simulation-As-A-Service (SimAAS) concept. The project included research and development {{in four of the}} five areas of a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) system. The four areas are Publishing, Discovery, Composition, and Deployment. Monitoring and policy enforcement will not be examined in this project. This project produced three products: a web interface Composer, a simple simulation, and a discussion of the information required for the Publish/Discovery process. This project focused on the composition of basic and complex models into a system where a tenant controls what models are present in simulation built to the tenants needs. This project demonstrated the ability and the actions required in a <b>multi</b> <b>tenant</b> environment for this process. The investigation has shown {{that there needs to be}} further research into the areas of data management used to store the information on model composition. There are other component based systems that have done research into alternate methods such as SOSA, FCINT simulation, or web based services to describe the Simulation-as-a-Service paradigm that are worth further study. In addition more work needs to be done in IAAS, and PAAS domains to work requirements needed for large scale distributed simulation. Lastly, security will become increasingly important if the architecture is used among tenants that do not want to share information with other tenants which leads to more research being done into encryption needed for all aspects of the Simulation-as-a-Service architecture and framework...|$|E
40|$|Software-Defined Storage (SDS) is an {{evolving}} concept {{for the management}} of data storage from the software's perspective. Multi-tenant applications running on the cloud can benefit from the concepts introduced by SDS by managing the allocation of data storage from the tenant's perspective. A multi-tenant application should guarantee both data separation and performance isolation towards every tenant, and migration of tenant data over time should be minimized as this is both an expensive and time consuming operation. Furthermore, with cloud computing compliance with regulatory policies regarding the storage of data remains a key hurdle, as end users often have no way to specify their requirements. In this article, we present a dynamic and extensible system {{for the management of}} storage resources in <b>multi</b> <b>tenant</b> cloud applications. In the presented approach, tenants are hierarchically clustered based on multiple scenario-specific characteristics, and allocated to storage resources using a hierarchical bin packing algorithm (static allocation). As the load changes over time, the system corresponds to these changes by reallocating storage resources when required (dynamic reallocation). We evaluate both the static and dynamic behavior of our system. Experiments confirm that the system achieves good results regarding the average bin usage, migrations over time and clustering of related tenants. On average, less than 0. 01 % of the total amount of data is reallocated during each migration using the dynamic Hierarchical First-Fit Decreasing (dHFFD) algorithm while achieving an average bin usage similar to First-Fit Decreasing (FFD). The dynamic Hierarchical Greedy Decreasing (dHGD) algorithm reduces the number of migrations by a factor 100 compared to dHFFD, but at the cost of provisioning additional storage instances...|$|E
