50|$|According to Nicolescu, {{transdisciplinarity}} {{is nevertheless}} radically distinct from <b>multidisciplinarity</b> and interdisciplinarity {{because of its}} goal, {{the understanding of the}} present world, which cannot be accomplished in the framework of disciplinary research. The goal of <b>multidisciplinarity</b> and interdisciplinarity always remains within the framework of disciplinary research. If transdisciplinarity is often confused with interdisciplinarity or <b>multidisciplinarity</b> (and by the same token, we note that interdisciplinarity is often confused with <b>multidisciplinarity)</b> this is explained in large part by the fact that all three overflow disciplinary boundaries. Advocates maintain this confusion hides the huge potential of transdisciplinarity.|$|E

50|$|We {{need the}} potent {{supportive}} presence of professionals. <b>Multidisciplinarity</b> {{is an essential}} element of social work. The notion of an educating school is gradually changing (Buda 2000, Gyenge 2000). Much more knowledge is to be imparted nowadays than was earlier. Academic requirements for pupils have been increasing, schools themselves have become stressors and potential risk factors. Besides the altering relationship between schools and society, due to individualization the role of peers in socialization has been increasing and peer groups has partly been taking the place of the family. Schools remained the only settings where factors influencing children can be controlled (Buda 2000:17).|$|E

5000|$|The {{question}} of the trace {{as an object of}} research in the context of complex systems therefore comes naturally in terms of <b>multidisciplinarity.</b> To articulate all these approaches without confusion, it is proposed to gradually build an innovative form of research networks on the subject of [...] "Trace", taking advantage of the framework established by CS-DC UNESCO UniTwin.The scientific objective is to show how the issue of the trace and its interpretation refers to complex processes. In the focus of CS-DC UNESCO UniTwin, this scientific objective leads to a strengthening of prevention of multiscale risks and contributes to the development of cooperation between different regions of the world. Consideration of inter-cultural and inter-consistent discipline is likely to support research {{for a long time and}} for the individual and social protection of the human species.|$|E
5000|$|Transdisciplinarity {{is defined}} by Basarab Nicolescu through three methodological postulates: the {{existence}} of levels of Reality, {{the logic of the}} included middle, and complexity. In the presence of several levels of Reality the space between disciplines and beyond disciplines is full of information. Disciplinary research concerns, at most, one and the same level of Reality moreover, in most cases, it only concerns fragments of one level of Reality. On the contrary, transdisciplinarity concerns the dynamics engendered by the action of several levels of Reality at once. The discovery of these dynamics necessarily passes through disciplinary knowledge. While not a new discipline or a new superdiscipline, transdisciplinarity is nourished by disciplinary research; in turn, disciplinary research is clarified by transdisciplinary knowledge in a new, fertile way. In this sense, disciplinary and transdisciplinary research are not antagonistic but complementary. As in the case of disciplinarity, transdisciplinary research is not antagonistic but complementary to <b>multidisciplinarity</b> and interdisciplinarity research.|$|E

This hypothesis was tested in two independent samples of health care workers (N = 66 and N = 95 teams), using team innovation as the outcome variable. Results support the hypothesis for the quality of innovation, rather than the number of innovations introduced by the teams. In many areas of work today, tasks have reached a level of complexity that requires a wide breadth of knowledge, skills and abilities (KSA). Therefore, organizations more frequently rely on multidisciplinary teams. For example, project teams charged with automotive design are often not only staffed with engineers from research and development units and experts from the manufacturing plant, but also market researchers and purchasing managers. The adoption of multidisciplinary teams is, however, not only seen as a task-driven necessity but also used as a strategy to increase team performance. The higher the degree of <b>multidisciplinarity,</b> that is, the higher the number of different disciplines represented on a team, the broader the range of KSA available to the team should be. Having a more varied set of task-relevant KSAs is assumed to translate into a greater variety of perspectives, which should, in turn, increase performance in terms of quality of decision-making or innovativeness of problem-solving. Research in the field of diversity, however, suggests that <b>multidisciplinarity</b> may not always benefit a team's performance. Findings in the realm of team diversity have been inconsistent with studies reporting both positive and negative effects of diversity in task-relevant KSAs (Milliken & Martins, 1996; Williams & O'Reilly, 1998; cf. the meta-analysis by Webber & Donahue, 2001). For example, top management teams' functional diversity was found to be positively related to organizational innovation (Bantel & Jackson, 1989; Wiersema & Bantel, 1992), while functional diversity of new product teams negatively affected performance (Ancona & Caldwell, 1992). The inconsistent results suggest that the effect of <b>multidisciplinarity</b> may be contingent upon other variables. Scholars from the field of diversity have suggested more strongly incorporating contextual aspects into the study of the diversity-performance relationship and adopting more complex models (Williams & O'Reilly, 1998). This proposal will be applied here to the study of <b>multidisciplinarity.</b> We go beyond {{the assumption}} of direct effects of <b>multidisciplinarity</b> on outcomes to test {{the extent to which the}} effect of <b>multidisciplinarity</b> depends on the quality of team processes...|$|E
40|$|Engineering {{students}} must be prepared develop creative solutions to problems that fall {{at the intersection of}} multiple disciplines. In order to better understand the role of multidisciplinary learning and creativity within engineering education, this thesis explores the <b>multidisciplinarity</b> of expertise/interest and creativity of college and graduate-level engineering and science students. An online survey was designed to investigate the relationship between creativity and <b>multidisciplinarity</b> of students. Findings from the two creativity tests (Alternate uses and Consequences) revealed a positive correlation between quantity of ideas generated and novelty of ideas. As expected, level of expertise in the engineering and natural sciences disciplines overall was greater than expertise in other disciplines, but interest level was more spread out across disciplines. A substantial correlation between <b>multidisciplinarity</b> of expertise/ interest and creativity was not observed. However, findings based on subpopulations of the student sample suggest the possibility that <b>multidisciplinarity</b> and creativity may be correlated, but {{the nature of the relationship}} may differ depending on other demographic factors such as gender, student status (undergraduate vs. graduate), or current field (engineering vs. sciences). by Kristi Elena Oki.

40|$|When {{the subject}} under {{discussion}} is interdisciplinarity, other themes emerge such as <b>multidisciplinarity,</b> crossdisciplinarity, and others. These terms {{share the same}} root word: discipline, which from the Latin discere means to learn, {{which is also the}} origin of the word disciple. Discipline can be defined as a systematically organized group of knowledge regarding an object, epistemic field or part of a curriculum. It is a way to structure and organize the knowledge about certain objects using a unique methodology. Considering interdisciplinarity from the curricular perspective (i. e., of teaching and learning) presupposes the integration between the disciplines comprising the curriculum in several educational areas. From the epistemic or knowledge perspective, it refers to how the integrated meaning of an object, event or situation is created, as a response to its complexity. <b>Multidisciplinarity</b> differs from interdisciplinarity in regards to the level of mutual interaction assumed by the different disciplines involved. In <b>multidisciplinarity,</b> the disciplines work together while preserving their independence; in other words, the limits of the disciplines are preserved. In interdisciplinarity, there is a strong interdependence and each discipline uses a similar or the same approach of the others, becoming mutually permeated...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to: (1) explore the proportion of HTx centers that have a multidisciplinary team and (2) assess the relationship between <b>multidisciplinarity</b> and the level of chronic illness management (CIM). BACKGROUND: The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) recommends a multidisciplinary approach in heart transplant (HTx) follow-up care but little is known regarding the proportion of HTx centers that meet this recommendation and the impact on patient care. HTx centers with a multidisciplinary team may offer higher levels of CIM, a care model that has the potential to improve outcomes after HTx. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of the BRIGHT study, a cross-sectional study in 11 countries. <b>Multidisciplinarity</b> in the 36 HTx centers was assessed through HTx director reports and was defined as having a team that was composed of physician(s), nurse(s), and another healthcare professional (either a social worker, psychiatrist, psychologist, pharmacist, dietician, physical therapist, or occupational therapist).
