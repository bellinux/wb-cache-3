40|$|Communication {{breaks through}} space and time. Today, people can {{communicate}} more easily {{because there is}} a telecommunication system named Internet, which links computer around the world to provide international communication services. By using internet people can send message or e-mail (electronic <b>mail),</b> <b>shop</b> for products and buy them on line, find and download software, make travel plans, do financial planning, look for a new job read some information published on the Web, search for people, and many other interesting services. The most interesting service, which is preferred by people ail over the world and in every age, is chatting. Chatting in the Internet is now not a new phenomenon in this globalization era. It is possible to talk to people in "real time" than to wait for e-mail. By using a chatting program named IRC, which stands for Internet relay chat, people may invite interested users to join the channel and communicate among themselves by typing the messages to everyone on the channel or sending private messages to individuals. As a means of communication, chatting also possesses typical characteristics of human communication. One of the characteristics is language style. One can speak very formally or informally, his choice being governed by circumstances. No individual speaks the same way at all times. Therefore, a person may change the style or the way he speaks according to the situation and context. In chatting, the dominant styles, which are used, are casual and intimate. These styles can be explained by a theory of language styles proposed by Martin Joos (1962). He states that in an informal setting, people tend to demonstrate these two styles. The linguistics features of these styles are: - not complete sentences -the use of contractions and shortened forms of words - the use of new and sometimes not polite words and meaning - diction: simple, mostly popular colloquial, frequent contractions, clipped words and some slang. The language used in internet chatting is informal, because the chatters will feel more comfortable and more confident when chatting with people without necessarily meet face to face. This condition brings them on the various chatting topics they like, without feeling clumsy when they are chatting with the invisible chatting partner. Therefore, in internet chatting people do not consider about the grammatical rules and they use abbreviations, slang, jargons, and non-verbal symbols, like smileys to make the conversation more interesting and intimate...|$|E

30|$|Interestingly, the friendship, whisper, <b>mail,</b> and <b>shop</b> {{networks}} {{of the game}} bot group, and the friendship and shop {{networks of}} the human group, show one predominant motif type. For instance, in the friendship network, type 7 {{accounts for more than}} 90  % of the node triplet relationships, which {{can be attributed to the}} highly reciprocal nature of the interactions. The opposite reasoning can be applied to shop: low reciprocity reflects the existence of big merchants. Moreover, in the whisper and mail network of the game bot group, type 1 accounts for more than 80  % of the node triplet relationships. This reflects the fact that some game bots send information about the location coordinates of monsters to other game bots in the case of the whisper network.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: With Internet {{becoming}} {{ubiquitous in}} every aspect of our life, there is an increase in the web applications providing day to day services like banking, <b>shopping,</b> <b>mailing</b> services, news updates, etc. But most of these applications have vulnerabilities or security loopholes like Cross site scripting (XSS), Cross-site request forgery (CSRF), SQL Injection which are being exploited by the hackers for malicious purposes. Hence {{there is a need for}} API’s/automated security tools to identify and/or prevent these vulnerabilities before the application goes live. This survey paper focuses on various security tools and prevention methodologies available to mitigate attacks due to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} fly {{shop was}} established in the old Albermarle Hotel at 103 W Park Street along with a small shooting gallery. The Baileys lived in a back room and the rent was $25 a month. Because there was limited opportunity for local fly business, Dan Bailey's became primarily a <b>mail</b> order fly <b>shop</b> and outfitter for visiting anglers. Dan Bailey produced his first mail order catalog in 1941—standard dry flies were $2.50 per dozen. In 1981, the year before Dan's passing, Dan Bailey's Fly Shop was the largest manufacturer of artificial flies in the United States producing over 750,000 flies annually for wholesale and retail customers. The mail order business had over 50,000 subscribers.|$|R
50|$|In its 1986 Summer <b>Mail</b> Order Hobby <b>Shop</b> catalog, TSR had {{listed a}} new Greyhawk {{adventure}} called WG7 Shadowlords, a high-level adventure {{to be written}} by Gary Gygax and Skip Williams.

It was the first new Greyhawk adventure in three years, but {{it had nothing to}} do with Gygax's original Castle Greyhawk. Instead, it was a compilation of twelve humorous dungeons levels, each one written by a freelance author. The puns and jokes often referenced modern culture—the Amazing Driderman, King Burger, Bugsbear Bunny, and the crew of Star Trek—and the module also included an appearance by Gygax's Mordenkainen in a movie studio.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{documents}} used in logistics. They are called: invoices, packing lists/slips/sheets (manifests), content lists, pick tickets, arrival acknowledgement forms/reports of many types (e.g. MSDS, damaged goods, returned goods, detailed/summary, etc.), import/export, delivery, {{bill of lading}} (BOL), etc. These documents are usually the contracts between the consignee and the consignor, so they are very important for both parties and any intermediary, like a third party logistics company (3PL) and governments. Document handling within logistics, supply chain management and distribution centers is usually performed manual labor or semi-automatically using bar code scanners, software and tabletop laser printers. There are some manufacturers of high speed document automation systems that will automatically compare the laser printed document to the order and either insert or automatically apply an enclosed wallet/pouch to the shipping container (usually a flexible polybag or corrugated fiberboard/rigid container). See below for external website video links showing these document automation systems. Protection of Privacy and Identity Theft are major concerns, especially {{with the increase of}} e-Commerce, Internet/Online shopping and Shopping channel (other, past references are catalogue and <b>mail</b> order <b>shopping)</b> making it more important than ever to guarantee the correct document is married or associated to the correct order or shipment every time.

The consumption behaviour {{of the participants in the}} study has been investigated across channels in a case study-based approach. The findings indicate that even though consumers prefer the convenience and control of the electronic channel, they often use it in combination with conventional channels (<b>shops,</b> <b>mail</b> order, telephone). The reported parallel channel use and switches between channels were in many cases not triggered by problems in the e-service design or delivery, but based on voluntary decisions by the consumers. The objective of the study presented here was to investigate the occurrence of and possible patterns in this voluntary multi-channel usage...|$|R
