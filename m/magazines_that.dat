5|$|Also in 1906, {{following}} an ordination ceremony held on Easter Sunday, Agârbiceanu was appointed parish priest in Bucium, in the Apuseni Mountains. For four years, he observed the difficult {{lives of the}} mountain dwellers and the problems encountered in the nearby gold mines. During this time, he wrote several notices in the magazine Ramuri, later published as În întuneric ("Into the Darkness", 1910), the novella Fefeleaga, and the novel Arhangelii ("The Archangels"), all of them based on the mining experience. He also started writing frequently for literary <b>magazines</b> <b>that</b> included Luceafărul, Unirea and Lupta. His other literary works of the period include De la țară ("From the Countryside", 1906), În clasa cultă ("In the Cultured Class", 1909), Două iubiri ("Two Loves", 1910), Prăpastia ("The Abyss", 1912), {{and a collection of}} Schițe și povestiri ("Sketches and Short Stories", 1912).|$|E

5|$|The {{magazine}} was canceled after the April 1941 issue, {{but when a}} boom in science fiction magazines began in 1950, the publishers revived it. The first {{issue of the new}} series was dated November 1950; a further six issues appeared, the last dated May 1952. In addition to Kuttner, contributors to the first run included Arthur J. Burks and Jack Williamson; the second run published stories by Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov, Jack Vance, and L. Sprague de Camp, among others. In the opinion of science fiction historian Joseph Marchesani, the quality of the second incarnation of the {{magazine was}} superior to the first, but it was unable to compete with the new higher-quality <b>magazines</b> <b>that</b> had appeared in the interim.|$|E

5|$|Both ships saw {{extensive}} {{service with}} the German Navy; Prinz Adalbert {{was used as}} a gunnery training ship for her entire peacetime career, while Friedrich Carl served with the fleet until 1909, when she was withdrawn to act as a torpedo training vessel. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, both vessels were mobilized and assigned to the cruiser squadron in the Baltic. Friedrich Carl was sunk by Russian naval mines off Memel in November 1914, though most of her crew was safely evacuated. Prinz Adalbert was torpedoed twice by British submarines operating in the Baltic; the first, on 1 July 1915, caused serious damage that was ultimately repaired. The second, on 23 October 1915, caused a catastrophic explosion in the ship's ammunition <b>magazines</b> <b>that</b> destroyed the vessel. Six hundred and seventy-two men were killed, the greatest single loss of life for the German Navy in the Baltic during the war.|$|E
5|$|Having secured American visas in July 1946, the Wodehouses made {{preparations}} {{to return}} to New York. They were delayed by Ethel's insistence on acquiring suitable new clothes and by Wodehouse's wish to finish writing his current novel, The Mating Season, in {{the peace of the}} French countryside. In April 1947 they sailed to New York, where Wodehouse was relieved at the friendly reception he received from the large press contingent awaiting his arrival. Ethel secured a comfortable penthouse apartment in Manhattan's Upper East Side, but Wodehouse was not at ease. The New York that he had known before the war was much changed. The <b>magazines</b> <b>that</b> had paid lavishly for his stories were in decline, and those that remained were not much interested in him. He was sounded out about writing for Broadway, but he was not at home in the post-war theatre; he had money problems, with large sums temporarily tied up in Britain, {{and for the first time}} in his career he had no ideas for a new novel. He did not complete one until 1951.|$|E

25|$|Charteris also edited or oversaw several <b>magazines</b> <b>that</b> tied in with The Saint. The {{first of}} these were anthologies titled The Saint's Choice that ran for seven issues in 1945–46. A few years later Charteris {{launched}} The Saint Detective Magazine (later titled The Saint Mystery Magazine and The Saint Magazine), which ran for 141 issues between 1953 and 1967, with a separate British edition that ran just as long but published different material. In most issues of Saint's Choice and the later magazines Charteris included at least one Saint story, usually previously published {{in one of his}} books but occasionally original. In several mid-1960s issues, however, he substituted Instead of the Saint, a series of essays on topics of interest to him. The rest of the material in the magazines consisted of novellas and short stories by other mystery writers of the day. An Australian edition was also published for a few years in the 1950s. In 1984 Charteris attempted to revive the Saint magazine, but it ran for only three issues.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, DVG and the HV co-founded the A.H. Gerhard Foundation, {{that only}} after a long {{struggle}} managed to provide elderly care for the unchurched and unbelievers in 1959. In the early 1960s, De Vrije Gedachte went through a relatively dormant phase, losing many of its members, reducing its activities and publishing irregular and low-quality <b>magazines</b> <b>that</b> changed names four times. In the late 1960s, a small revival occurred through new young members, who resisted the world that was organised by the old generation. They protested against the Vietnam War, and created their own culture around pop music, flower power and sexual liberation. DVG {{played an important role}} in rethinking sexual morality, promoting women's emancipation, and reducing the influence of the churches; it often partnered with the Dutch Society for Sexual Reform (NVSH) in sex education activities. In 1978, the association changed its full name to Vrijdenkersvereniging De Vrije Gedachte ("Freethinkers' association The Free Thought"). New bylaws were agreed upon that focused on atheism and collaboration with other humanistist organisations.|$|E
