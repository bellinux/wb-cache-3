5000|$|In a {{hydraulic}} brake system, the driver applies force by a mechanical link from the {{pedal to the}} <b>master</b> <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder.</b> In turn the <b>master</b> <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> develops hydraulic pressure in the wheels. In contrast, the electro-hydraulic brake SBC provides the brakes with a brake fluid supply from the hydraulic high-pressure reservoir, which is sufficient for several braking events. A piston pump driven by an electric motor supplies a controlled brake fluid pressure between 140 and 160 Bar in the gas diaphragm reservoir.|$|E
50|$|The system {{employs a}} travel sensor and a {{pressure}} sensor at the pedal {{to measure the}} speed and force of the driver's command. The control unit processes this information and generates the control signals for the wheel pressure modulators. Normally, the <b>master</b> <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> is detached from the brake circuit. A pedal travel simulator creates normal pedal feedback. If ESP intervenes, the high-pressure reservoir supplies the required brake pressure quickly and precisely to selected wheels, without any driver involvement.|$|E
50|$|Bellcranks {{are also}} seen in {{automotive}} applications, {{as part of}} the linkage connecting the throttle pedal to the carburetor, and connecting the brake pedal to the <b>master</b> <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder.</b> In vehicle suspensions, bellcranks are used in pushrod-style suspensions in automobiles or in the Christie suspension in tanks. Vertically-mounted suspensions may not be feasible in some vehicle designs due to space, aerodynamic, or other design constraints; bellcranks translate the vertical motion of the wheel in to horizontal motion, allowing the suspension to be mounted transversely or longitudinally within the vehicle.|$|E

The VTS had a 19 mm front anti-roll bar and 22 mm rear anti-roll bar, while the VTR and Westcoast/Furio had a 19 mm front and 21 mm or sometimes 19 mm rear anti-roll bar.|$|E
5000|$|The only {{available}} engine was AMC's 327 CID L OHV V8, {{in either the}} regular fuel, 2-barrel carburetor and 8.7:1 compression ratio, [...] version or the premium gasoline, 4-barrel version with 9.7:1 compression ratio, [...] version. The 1962 Ambassador came with a dual chamber <b>master</b> <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> that separated {{the front and rear}} brakes so that in the event of the failure of one chamber some braking function would remain. This design was offered by only a few cars at that time. The 1962 models were equipped with [...] "Walker" [...] (brand) flow-through mufflers. The 108 in wheelbase 1962 Ambassador was lighter than its 117 in wheelbase predecessors and when equipped with the [...] 327 CID L V8, it was a spirited performer.|$|E
50|$|The GTS {{of early}} 1990 was a limited run of 510 units for the New Zealand market. Powered by the base 3.8-Litre V6 engine {{it was based}} on the Executive model but {{featured}} upgrades including a body kit, 5-spoke alloy wheels and FE2 sports suspension (with upgraded springs and stabiliser bar for the front end and gas filled shocks absorbers at the back), larger front brake discs and <b>master</b> <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The front suspension geometry was also modified to lower ride height by 35 mm for improved road handling. Inside, the car had power windows, central locking, electric antenna and four speaker radio cassette sound system. Suggested retail was $35,995 GTS and $37,295 GTS for the manual and automatic versions, respectively. It was available painted Vivid White or GTS Blue metallic (in Australia, Alpine White or Imperial Blue).|$|E
50|$|The E30 M3 {{had special}} {{front and rear}} brake {{calipers}} and rotors. It also has a special <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|R

ABSTRACT: Reports of many functional deficiencies are these days rampant in many aluminium products flooding the Nigeria markets. These emanate from the local aluminium manufacturing, cottage foundry industries and much more from goods imported in the country. The study investigates the metallurgical properties of as-received and cast aluminium alloy samples used in the floating piston/calliper of the automobile hydraulic <b>master</b> <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Commercially available aluminium alloy is procured from which callipers were cast and characterised. The study compares the physical properties by Hardness test, microstructural properties using high resolution metallurgical microscope, X-Ray Diffraction, chemical composition using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry. The as-received samples are characterised by poor metallurgical qualities such as variation in weight and density, low HBN, low tensile strength, high porosity and sand inclusions from the previous poor casting practices, hence abnormalities result under usage. The aluminium alloy was technically cast at pouring temperature higher than 750 oC using sand mould of high permeability. The casting gave higher HBN values of eutectic-AlSi structured aluminium alloy. The tensile strength calculated as approximate relationship between the hardness and the tensile strength, gave lower 329. 09 Mpa and 154. 78 Mpa strength for as-received samples {{as compared with the}} cast alloy having 353. 58 Mp...|$|E
40|$|Freno AB in Piteå has {{developed}} a tractor with a semi-trailer based on a Volkswagen Crafter chassis. The modifications of the vehicle that are included in this thesis work covers the parking brake system of the semitrailer, the rear underrun protection device of the tractor and the maneuvering of the trailer’s service brake. The manufacturer of the tractor requests an independent analysis of whether these modifications have negative influences on the vehicle. A description of the parking brake system was made and its function was analyzed using force and torque equilibrium. The parking brake of the semi-trailer is maneuvered by an electric signal from the switch controlling the parking brake indicator on the dash board. The results were compared with regulations applicable by {{the date of the}} vehicle’s service entry. In theory, the parking brake meets the legal requirement to keep the vehicle stationary in a hill with 16 % slope and the design requirement of 18 %. Regulations regarding the rear underrun protection were studied and the company’s contact person was interviewed about the modification’s procedure. The underrun protection device has been moved forwards due to the shortening of the rear overhang. No modification has been made to the device itself that can affect its strength. According to EU Directive 70 / 221 /EC, rear underrun protection is not necessary for this vehicle type. For the maneuvering system of the semi-trailer’s service brakes, the designer was interviewed and a system description was formulated. The trailer’s service brakes are maneuvered by a directional valve connected to the tractor’s brake circuits. This valve is the only interface between the tractor and the semitrailer brake circuits. The maximum consumption of brake fluid caused by the directional valve is 0. 3 cm 3. A test method was produced to determine if pressure variations caused by the semi-trailer’s ABS system can be measured in the tractors brake circuits. The measurements are to be implemented with a pressure sensor connected to the <b>master</b> <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> and a data logger which measures the brake pressure during a braking operation. Based on the recorded data the process can be analyzed. The test methodology was inspired by the test made to the vehicle by the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute (VTI) according to Directive 71 / 320 /EC.

50|$|The 1967 LTD two-door hardtop {{got a new}} formal roofline, {{keeping up}} with the competition. All models {{received}} the 1967 federally-mandated safety features, including an energy-absorbing steering column and wheel, non-protruding instrument panel knobs, a dual-circuit <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder,</b> four-way hazard flashers, and front outboard shoulder belt mounting points.|$|R
25|$|The 1967 {{model year}} {{required}} new safety equipment. A new energy-absorbing steering column {{was accompanied by}} an energy-absorbing steering wheel, padded instrument panel, non-protruding control knobs, and four-way emergency flashers. A shoulder belt option was also featured, and the <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> was now a dual reservoir unit with a backup hydraulic circuit.|$|R
50|$|The {{brake light}} {{operated}} {{only by the}} rear brake in the UK market. A switch was available as a spare part to fit onto the front <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> casting which would also operate the brake light. The necessary wiring was already included on the main wiring harness in the headlamp shell. Sales were 14,000+ in 1973.|$|R
5000|$|The {{braking system}} {{comprised}} a cast-iron detachable brake drum on each roadwheel, with the retardation provided by asbestos-lined brake shoes mounted in a leading/trailing arrangement. The shoes were operated by double-acting Lockheed hydraulic cylinders, fed {{by a single}} hydraulic circuit connected to the <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder,</b> which was mechanically linked to the brake pedal. [...] This design was normal for that time.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2010, certain 2005-2007 model Acura RLs {{were subject}} to a safety recall for {{potential}} leaking of the <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> seal. [...] A seal in the <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> may be susceptible to damage following the use of brake fluid other than the recommended Acura or (Honda) Genuine DOT3 brake fluid. If the seal is damaged, it {{can result in a}} brake fluid leak under certain conditions. If a leak should occur, the driver might see a low brake fluid indicator light or a BRAKE FLUID LOW or CHECK BRAKE SYSTEM message. If the driver continues to drive the vehicle after receiving this message without refilling the brake fluid reservoir, it could result in a brake pedal that feels soft or spongy, and may eventually affect braking performance, increasing the risk of a crash. Affected vehicles were to be inspected and repaired, as applicable, at no charge. Reportedly, this recall applied to both 2005-2007 Acura RL and 2005-2007 Honda Odyssey models.|$|R
25|$|For 1967 all Fords {{featured}} a large, padded hub {{in the center}} of the plastic steering wheel, along with an energy-absorbing steering column (introduced late into the 1967 model year), padded interior surfaces, recessed controls on the instrument panel, and front outboard shoulder belt anchors. Another safety related change was the introduction of the dual <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> used on all subsequent Galaxies (and other Ford models).|$|R
50|$|Frentzen again {{crashed in}} the {{practice}} session for the Canadian Grand Prix. He subsequently complained of dizziness and headaches, and was replaced for the race by the team's test driver, Ricardo Zonta. Once again the EJ11 performed well in qualifying, {{but was unable to}} keep the same pace up in the race. Trulli however once again looked set for a strong finish and maybe a podium when his <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> failed. Zonta finished a disappointing 7th, outside the points positions.|$|R
50|$|Subaru did {{not sell}} a Legacy Turbo in the United States between 1994-2005, when the Indiana-built Legacy GT was introduced. This {{was due to}} Subaru having {{upgraded}} the single turbo used in the Legacy with a twin turbo engine starting with the Second Generation and continued with the Third Generation. The twin turbo configuration was not compatible with left-hand drive vehicles because the turbo {{on the left side}} interferes with both the <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> and steering linkage, among other things.|$|R
50|$|Brake-by-wire {{is used in}} all common hybrid and {{electric}} vehicles produced since 1998 including all Toyota, Ford, and General Motors Electric and hybrid models. The Toyota Synergy Drive and the Rav4 EV use a system where a modified ABS (antilock brake system) actuator is coupled with a special hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> to create a hydraulic system, coupled with the brake control unit (computer).Ford's system is almost identical to the Toyota system, and the General Motors system uses different nomenclature for components while the operation is virtually identical.|$|R

50|$|Earlier 2003-2004 Supersport models had a high-specification chassis {{featuring}} fully adjustable Showa {{front forks}} and a fully adjustable Sachs shock absorber. From 2004 onwards Ducati reduced {{the level of}} chassis specification {{to that of the}} Sport (which was subsequently dropped from the range some time later). The alloy swinging arm was replaced with a steel item; the five-spoke Marchesini wheels were replaced by three-spoke wheels by Brembo; the front forks were replaced by non-adjustable Marzocchi items; the Brembo Goldline clutch and <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> were replaced with lower specification items as found on many lower capacity Ducati Monsters.|$|R
50|$|Honda’s first street {{motorcycle}} with {{a combined}} braking system (then called Unified Braking) was the 1983 GL1100. This system was derived from a 1970s RCB1000 world endurance race bike. Honda made several variations of the LBS system with differing levels of complexity and integration. The Honda CBR1000F and CBR1100XX and VFR800 featured what Honda called LBS II (now called Dual CBS), a system where both levers would activate both brakes through a system of secondary pistons and proportioning/delay valves. One front brake caliper was connected to a secondary master cylinder, and the caliper was allowed to rotate slightly to apply pressure to the piston in that secondary <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b> <b>Braking</b> force was translated into pressure that {{was sent to the}} rear <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Only the two outer pistons in the front brake calipers were directly activated by the brake lever; the center piston received pressure from the rear pedal via the proportioning and delay valve.|$|R
2500|$|The dual-reservoir <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder,</b> with {{separate}} {{front and rear}} hydraulic systems, was introduced in 1962, six years ahead of the Federal requirement. [...] The first fully automatic heater-air conditioning system also appeared, as did the three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic automatic transmission; it would become the GM standard model for several decades. [...] From the late 1960s, Cadillac offered a fiber-optic warning system to alert the driver to failed light bulbs. The use of extensive bright-work on the exterior and interior also decreased each year after 1959. By the 1966 model year, even the rear bumpers ceased to be all chrome – large portions were painted, including the headlight bezels.|$|R
50|$|They were {{fitted with}} the 328cc Excelsior Talisman engine like the older SE328, {{and the four}} speed and reverse type VR gearbox, and were {{available}} as both soft and hardtops. The chassis plate, mounted on the bulkhead above the <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder,</b> was the printed SE328 type but with 'T60' stamped in the chassis number block along with the chassis number. Chassis numbers run from 1 to approximately 1800. The first 600 cars (approximately) had a bench seat with an umbrella-type pull handbrake and aluminium reinforcement sections in the punt body section. Cars thereafter had steel punt chassis sections, bucket seats and a floor-mounted handbrake lever.|$|R

50|$|Early {{cars from}} Jan 1957 to about chassis number 476 in June 1957 still used a column gear change. During their {{production}} run a Deluxe model was offered which was bodily the same but featured polished wheel trims and spinners, tachometer and twin carburettors. The chassis plate {{was similar to}} the Anzani type on the early cars but was later changed to a printed type fitted to the bulkhead above the <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The printed type chassis plate had type ‘SE328’ printed on it. Most of these cars had the three-speed gearbox similar to the Anzani except for the mounting flanges. All of the cars had the sloping leading edges to the doors.|$|R
50|$|Production {{started in}} June 1986. At {{a cost of}} around $6,000 new on release it {{was seen as an}} {{expensive}} bike for a 250 cc, but given that places such as Japan, Italy and Australia had 250 licensing laws in place one can imagine the stir that something that could hassle 750s on a track caused. The parallel twin 2MA variant being the UK variant and the 1KT model being the domestic Japanese variant. Variations between these two models being minimal, e.g. wording on the <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> in English or Japanese. Lighting arrangements were also different, to comply with UK type approval regulations, particularly the indicators were mounted on stalks rather than faired into the bodywork.|$|R
50|$|The R-100 models {{received}} a double disc brake {{in the front}} wheel. For 1976 to 1979 models the front brake was a pivot caliper ATE disc actuated from the controls via cable to a <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> under the tank. From 1980 models onwards front brakes were changed to a Brembo fixed caliper <b>brake,</b> and the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> was moved from undertank to the right handlebar. With the introduction of Monolever models in 1986, the Brembo fixed calipers were mounted on the fork tubes. The back brake was initially a drum brake. Starting in the 1978 model year (September 1977), the R 100 RS and RT and S models {{received a}} Brembo rear disc brake with fixed caliper on the rear wheel, and from model year 1986 the drum brake returned.|$|R
5000|$|The Yamaha FZ-600 was {{produced}} from 1986-1988 {{being replaced by}} the FZR-600 (1989-1999). The FZ engine was closely derived from the XJ-600 motor, which can itself trace its lineage back through the XJ-550 to the XJ-400, a Japanese home market model. This motor was also used in the YX600 Radian. It also shared brakes with {{a huge number of}} other Yamaha Models before, during, and even after its production. The same front <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> was used on the FZR-600 up until the end of its production (1999). In 1986 Yamaha produced the FZ [...] "Pure Sport" [...] version, with more performance oriented modifications. The FZ-600's main competitors when it was released were the Kawasaki GPZ600 and Honda CBR600F. However Suzuki's GSX-600 Katana was given little consideration, with the GSXR-750 getting all the attention at the time.|$|R
