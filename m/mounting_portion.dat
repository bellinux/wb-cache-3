40|$|Threaded {{carriers}} {{which are}} inserted into sheet metal by forming are also named "functional elements". These functional elements offer multiple advantages. Two examples for significant advantages are {{the opportunity for}} a highly automated installation process and the possibility to unloose the joint. The functional elements are often used within the meaning of the guideline VDI 2230 for mechanical engineering applications. Because of the <b>mounting</b> <b>portion</b> in consequence of the forming these elements distinguish from the conventional screw connections and the underlying guideline. Therefore the <b>mounting</b> <b>portion</b> {{must be taken into account}} if there are questions regarding mounting and designing connections with functional elements. This can be done in various ways. Therefore some of these ways will be demonstrated with the help of scientific results from a current research project and the use of SIMUFACT within the presentation...|$|E
40|$|US 20090139690 A 1 UPAB: 20090619 NOVELTY - The sink has a {{conductive}} {{base body}} (1) provided with structures for increasing a heat-dissipating surface. A metallic molded part including a <b>mounting</b> <b>portion</b> mounted to a heat source. A heat-transfer portion e. g. pin, of the molded part {{is made of}} an electrically insulating material e. g. ceramic, and the body is insulated from the molded part. The <b>mounting</b> <b>portion</b> is protruded from the body, and is provided with a lug (3) extending in an angle {{with regard to the}} heat-transfer portion that is inserted in a thermal vias of a printed circuit board (10) e. g. surface mount device (SMD). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a method for producing a heat sink (2) a method for inserting a heat source on a printed circuit board. USE - Heat sink for cooling an electronic device. ADVANTAGE - The sink improves the heat dissipation by increasing surface of the conductive base body, so that the heat dissipation can take place both via convection to liquid/gaseous cooling medium by radiation. The base body of the insulating material achieves heat dissipation to the environment without short circuits. The heat sink can be produced in a cost-effective manner, and allows simultaneous cooling of different electronic devices that are at different electrical potentials, by using a single cooling element...|$|E
