According to the [...] "System of armoured engineering armament of the Red Army", the ST-26 was developed by designers from the Academy of Military Engineering (chief engineer of the project - Gutman) {{in the beginning of}} 1932. The ST-26 had only one shortened turret {{in the middle of the}} hull armed with a DT tank machine gun with 1,008 rounds; arc of fire was 211°. Special equipment consisted of a metal tracked bridge 7.35 m long and weighing 1100 kg, supports for the bridge (a front frame with two forks and two guiding rollers, lower forks with a hoisting mechanism and a roller, a rear frame with mounts and two rollers) and a cable winch (driven by the tank engine with the use of the reversing gear) inside the vehicle. The ST-26 was intended to provide for crossing of trenches and streams 6 - 6.5 m wide and barriers up to 2 m high by T-27, T-26 and BT light tanks: the bridge had a <b>maximum</b> <b>load</b> <b>rating</b> of 14 t. The bridge could be laid with the help of the cable winch in 25-40 seconds without crew exit; the raising operation took 2-3 min and a commander needed to come out from the vehicle in order to control the process. The ST-26 with its cable system for bridge laying was tested in the summer of 1932.|$|E

Concrete is generally preferable to other materials because of the low cost, wide availability {{and the ability to}} be constructed on-site.

High impact loading and peak loading early in the stance phase of gait {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of knee osteoarthritis. This was a secondary analysis of longitudinal data to investigate loading-related indices at baseline in an APM group (3 months post-surgery) and a healthy control group, and again 2 years later (follow-up). At baseline, 82 participants with medial APM and 38 healthy controls were assessed, with 66 and 23 re-assessed at follow-up, respectively. Outcome measures included: (i) heel strike transient (HST) presence and magnitude, (ii) <b>maximum</b> <b>loading</b> <b>rate,</b> (iii) peak vertical force (Fz) during early stance. At baseline, <b>maximum</b> <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> was lower in the operated leg (APM) and non-operated leg (non-APM leg) compared to controls (p ≤ 0. 03) and peak Fz was lower in the APM leg compared to non-APM leg (p ≤ 0. 01). Over 2 years, peak Fz increased in the APM leg compared to the non-APM leg and controls (p ≤ 0. 01). Following recent APM, people may adapt their gait to protect the operated knee from excessive loads, as evidenced by a lower <b>maximum</b> <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> in the APM leg compared to controls, and a reduced peak Fz in the APM leg compared to the non-APM leg.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{presents an}} approach to determine the overload capabilities of oil-cooled power transformers depending on the ambient temperature. For this purpose the investigated method introduces a simplified, empirical based thermal model that predicts changes in oil temperature with high accuracy. This model considers the entire transformer as a single, homogenous tempered body with a certain thermal capacity. All electrical losses are perceived as an input of equally distributed heat and assumed to be {{the sum of the}} load and no-load losses given by the transformer design. In contrary to earlier approaches the heat exchange with the ambience is modelled as a complex function depending first of all on the temperature difference between the transformer and its surroundings. Furthermore, the <b>loading</b> <b>rate,</b> material properties, levels of temperatures and emerging temperature gradients are taken into account as influencing factors determining the heat exchange. To display the behaviour of a specific transformer, the model employs several empirical factors. For determination of these empirical factors an evaluation time of two to four representative weeks of transformer operation is found to be sufficient. To validate the created model and test its operational reliability, measuring data from several ONAN- and ONAF-transformers are consulted. These data sets comprise the top oil and ambient temperature as well as the <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> and the status of the cooling system. Furthermore, the corresponding name plate data is integrated. Subsequently to the calculation of the top oil temperature, the <b>maximum</b> constant <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> resulting in a hot-spot temperature below critical level is determined based upon the remarks of IEC 60076 - 7 [1]. Finally, a characteristic linear function for each investigated transformer displaying the <b>maximum</b> <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> depending solely on the ambient temperature is derived. In case of the investigated ONAN- and ONAF-transformers within a power range of 31. 5 - 63 MVA, significant overload potentials could be disclosed...|$|R

The treatment of wastewater from a pulp and paper mill, and from a pharmaceutical plant was studied. Both carrier types {{were found to be}} suitable for supporting biofilm growth. With the porous beads, however, suspended sludge accumulated between the carriers, which caused clogging of the process.

The objective {{of this study was}} to develop and test, on-site, a new hybrid filter system that would reduce the risk of clogging at an organic <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> substantially greater than the <b>maximum</b> recommended <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> for intermittent sand filters. The system comprised a 0. 6 m deep horizontal flow biofilm reactor (HFBR) over a 0. 85 m deep stratified sand filter. The HFBR consisted of a stack of 20 horizontal corrugated polyvinyl chloride sheets, at 32 mm vertical spacings. The sheets were arranged so that the wastewater flowed over and back along alternate sheets down through the stack. The main biofilm growth formed on these sheets. The hybrid filter was loaded with septic tank effluent from an office/garage complex at the rate of 206 L/m(2) day for a period of 400 days in two phases. During the first phase, the effluent volume of 600 L/day was applied in 24 doses/day for 10 min/dose, and during the second phase in 6 doses/day for 40 min/dose. Biofilms in the HFBR substantially reduced the organic and suspended solids loads that reached the sand filter surface and allowed an average total biochemical oxygen demand (BODT) <b>loading</b> <b>rate,</b> based on HFBR plan area, of 37 g BODT/m(2) day to be applied to the system without clogging.

An increase in hydrogen partial pressure above a critical concentration of 6. 5 - 7 Pa indicated the initial stage of digester overloading (i. e., volatile fatty acids accumulation). A H 2 -based computer control system, using a critical hydrogen partial pressure of 6. 5 Pa as the setpoint, was found to be effective for the safe operation of a laboratory digester close to its <b>maximum</b> sustainable <b>loading</b> <b>rate.</b> The existence of a relationship between hydrogen level and organic <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> was also confirmed on a 600 m 3 industrial digester, with digester overloading occurring at hydrogen concentrations above 7 Pa. The results suggest that the dissolved hydrogen concentration is capable of being a sensitive on-line parameter for the automated management of anaerobic digesters near their <b>maximum</b> sustainable <b>loading</b> capacity.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the effects of climate, season and {{wastewater}} quality on contaminant removal efficiency of constructed wetlands implemented in Mediterranean and continental-Mediterranean climate region of Spain. To this end, two experimental horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands located in Barcelona and León (Spain) were compared. The two constructed wetland systems had the same experimental set-up. Each wetland had a surface area of 2. 95 m 2, a water depth of 25 cm and a granular medium of D 60 = 7. 3 mm, and was planted with Phragmites australis. Both systems were designed in order to operate with a <b>maximum</b> organic <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> of 6 gDBO m− 2 d− 1.

Kinetic and kinematic data were collected for 14 subjects running heel-toe at an average speed of 4 m/s. The results showed that the four tested viscoelastic insoles did not differ in variables describing the vertical impact forces (vertical force peak, time of occurrence of vertical force peak, <b>maximum</b> vertical <b>loading</b> <b>rate)</b> compared to the conventional insoles furnished in running shoes.

40|$|Intermittent sand {{filtration}} {{is a common}} and effective method for treating septic tank effluent. However, if the <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> is too high, clogging and ponding of the sand filter surface layer can occur due to the accumulation of excessive biomass and the deposition of suspended solids. This ponding limits the practicality of {{sand filtration}} as it makes it necessary to take the filter out of service for maintenance. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop and test, on-site, a new hybrid filter system that would reduce the risk of clogging at an organic <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> substantially greater than the <b>maximum</b> recommended <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> for intermittent sand filters. The system comprised a 0. 6 m deep horizontal flow biofilm reactor (HFBR) over a 0. 85 m deep stratified sand filter. The HFBR consisted of a stack of 20 horizontal corrugated polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sheets, at 32 mm vertical spacings. The sheets were arranged so that the wastewater flowed over and back along alternate sheets down through the stack. The main biofilm growth formed on these sheets. The hybrid filter was loaded with septic tank effluent from an office/garage complex at the rate of 206 L/m 2 -d for a period of 400 days in 2 phases. During the first phase, the effluent volume of 600 L/d was applied in 24 doses/d for 10 minutes per dose, and during the second phase in 6 doses/d for 40 minutes/dose. Biofilms in the HFBR substantially reduced the organic and suspended solids loads that reached the sand filter surface and allowed an average total biochemical demand (BODT) <b>loading</b> <b>rate,</b> based on HFBR plan area, of 37 g BODT/m 2 -d to be applied to the system without clogging. This rate was substantially greater than the <b>maximum</b> recommended <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> of 24 g BODT/m 2 -d for intermittent sand filters (US EPA 1980). During both loading phases a BODT removal of 94 % was achieved and nitrification was nearly complete. The average effluent BODT was 12 - 4 mg/L during both phases. The hybrid filter system appeared to perform better in terms of suspended solids handling and nitrification during the more frequent dosing phase. The hybrid filtration system offers a more compact alternative to intermittent sand filtration on its own with little risk of clogging...|$|R

40|$|During 1980, septage {{was applied}} in rates of 1120 and 1500 kg of {{nitrogen}} per hectare to three different soil textures {{in an attempt}} to determine <b>maximum</b> <b>loading</b> <b>rates.</b> These rates resulted in increased concentrations of nitrates in the soil water for a Hubbard loamy Sanci, Waukegan silt loam and Lester clay loam, indicating that the application rates exceeded the maximum rate that the soils could treat. The first year's results indicate that soil type, application rates and soil depth resulted in no significant difference in total Kjeldahl nitrogen, ammonia, fecal streptococcus and fecal coliforms in the soil water samples. Nitrate concentrations, however, were significantly different between the soils, application rates and soil depths. For the Hubbard loamy sand, rainfall had a larger effect on nitrate concentrations and movement within the soil profile than for the Waukegan silt loam or Lester clay 1 oam. 0 n the Waukegan silt loam and Lester clay loam there was relatively little change in the nitrate concentration in the soil profile during the period when septage was applied twice a week. After the design loading had been applied to the soil and no further applications made, a sharp increase in nitrate concentrations was observed in the soil profile. This probably resulted from changing the anaerobic surface layer to an aerobic condition resulting in nitrification and subsequent movement of nitrates through the profile following a rainfall event. With no additional septage application, the second year's data indicate a significant difference in nitrate-N between soils, application rates, and depths. Generally, the nitrate concentrations in the Hubbard loamy sand and Waukegan silt loam were less than the first year, but the concentrations in the Lester clay loam were higher than the first year. This indicates that nitrification and nitrate movement in the Lester clay loam are slower than the other two soils. Application resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} concentration of soil water calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium during the first year of the study. However, there was no increase in the phosphorus content of the soil water. Water Resources Research Cente...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{economical}} means of nitrogen removal from leachate is biological treatment by nitrification, followed by heterotrophic denitrification. An alternative biological denitrification process is autotrophic denitrification using Thiobacillus denitrificans. This autotrophic bacteria oxidizes elemental sulphur to sulphate while reducing nitrate to elemental nitrogen gas, thereby {{eliminating the need for}} addition of organic carbon compounds. For this study, pilot-scale elemental sulphur packed bed columns with fixed-film denitrification have been selected as the most suitable treatment process. The effect of hydraulic retention time as well as the effect of concentration and <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> of nitrate on nitrate removal efficiency as a function of sulphur particle size were determined. The results indicate that (i) autotrophic denitrification can effectively remove nitrate from synthetic and actual nitrified leachate at concentrations much higher than hitherto reported; (ii) the minimum hydraulic retention time necessary for complete denitrification depends on sulphur particle size; (iii) the <b>maximum</b> area <b>loading</b> <b>rate,</b> in g NO 3 [...] N/m 2 ·d, appears to be the process limiting factor and is practically independent of sulphur particle size; and (iv) the observed stoichiometric relationships compare well with those previously reported. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the suitability of}} anaerobic treatment of PEG-containing wastewater as a pre-treatment in order to recover the potential {{energy in the form}} of biogas. Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) are polymers composed of repeating sub-units of identical structure, called monomers, and are the most commercially important polyethers. PEGs are liquid or low-melting solids, depending on their molecular weights. It is prepared by polymerization of ethylene oxide. PEGs are non-toxic and are widely used in the manufacture of cosmetics, water-soluble lubricants, antifreeze agents for automobile radiators, and pharmaceutical, in the conservation treatment of ancient wood and in the production of non-ionic surfactants. Therefore, millions of tons of PEGs are manufactured or involved in industrial processes worldwide every year. Most of them reach conventional wastewater treatment systems after industrial utilization. A batch-assay test was performed in order to examine the degradability and the methane production potential of PEG-containing wastewater. A laboratory-scale fixed bed reactor made from glass column was also used in this study {{in order to determine the}} <b>maximum</b> <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> during continuous feeding mode. Mesophilic condition (37 °C) and synthetic wastewaters were applied in both experiments. In the batch-assay tests, most of the organic matters (mainly PEG) were degraded and converted to biogas after 70 hours of incubation. A methane production potential of approx. 0. 36 m 3 ∙kg- 1 CODadded or 0. 60 m 3 ∙kg- 1 PEGadded was observed in this batch-assay test. During the continuous-feeding mode in the fixed-bed reactor, an OLR of 8 kg-COD∙m- 3 ∙d- 1 was considered as the maximum OLR with more than 90 % of the COD in the wastewater was eliminated. Considering the performance of the laboratory-scale reactor (i. e. COD elimination and biogas production), it can be concluded that anaerobic treatment is a suitable method for the treatment of PEG-containing wastewater...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of high rate anaerobic processes {{has reached a}} point where {{there is a need for}} better monitoring and control strategies. The general objective of this research was to evaluate the potential of headspace gas monitoring and control of fixed-film anaerobic digesters. ^ Laboratory-scale fixed-film anaerobic digesters treating a synthetic soluble carbohydrate waste were used. Trace gases, hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and final gases, methane and carbon dioxide, were monitored on-line. The effects of liquid recirculation on the rate of gas transfer from the generation site to the headspace of the reactor were evaluated. It was found that liquid recirculation rates do not affect mass transport rates significantly. Gas transport was primarily taking place by rising bubbles. Methane and carbon dioxide were transported from the bubbles to the surrounding liquid, whereas hydrogen was transported from the liquid to the bubbles. The rate of substrate uptake by the biofilm was significantly affected by liquid recirculation rates. ^ The responses of trace gases to toxic stress by cadmium and formaldehyde were evaluated. Trace gases proved to be sensitive indicators of toxic stress. Comparison with previous studies revealed that fixed-film digesters were several times more resistant to toxicity than suspended-growth digesters. Adaptation to formaldehyde was fast and degradation of the compound was consistently observed. ^ On-line control of effluent COD concentration using headspace parameters was possible when changes in influent strength were imposed to the system. ^ A new parameter for digester monitoring was proposed in this study. The new parameter was named the methanogenic activity index, MAI. The MAI provides a simple criterion to determine when the reactor is reaching its <b>maximum</b> <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> and also, provides a clear signal of the occurrence of toxicity events in the process. ...|$|R
