5|$|By 1855, the {{economic}} climate had changed dramatically. Gold could be retrieved profitably from the goldfields only by medium to {{large groups of}} workers, either in partnerships or as employees. By the mid-1850s, it was the owners of these gold-mining companies who made the money. Also, the population and economy of California had become large and diverse enough that <b>money</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> made {{in a wide variety}} of conventional businesses.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd-century crisis {{started a}} chain-reaction of {{socio-economic}} effects that proved decisive {{for the development}} of the late army. The combination of barbarian devastation and reduced tax-base due to plague bankrupted the imperial government, which resorted to issuing ever more debased coin e.g. the antoninianus, the silver coin used to pay the troops in this period, lost 95% of its silver content between its launch in 215 and its demise in the 260s. Thus 20 times more <b>money</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> distributed with the same amount of precious metal. This led to rampant price inflation: for example, the price of wheat under Diocletian was 67 times the typical price under the Principate. The monetary economy collapsed and the army was obliged to rely on unpaid food levies to obtain supplies. Food levies were raised without regard to fairness, ruining the border provinces where the military was mainly based. Soldiers' salaries became worthless, which reduced the army's recruits to a subsistence-level existence. This in turn discouraged volunteers and forced the government to rely on conscription and large-scale recruitment of barbarians into the regular army because of the shortfalls caused by the plague. By the mid-4th century, barbarian-born men probably accounted for about a quarter of all recruits (and over a third in elite regiments), likely a far higher share than in the 1st and 2nd centuries.|$|E
25|$|Following United States President Bill Clinton's administration's {{aggressive}} financial deregulation {{campaign in}} the 1990s, globalisation leaders overturned longstanding restrictions by governments that limited foreign ownership of their banks, deregulated currency exchange, and eliminated restrictions on how quickly <b>money</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> withdrawn by foreign investors.|$|E

Behn proved that <b>money</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> made by writing at the sacrifice, perhaps, of certain {{agreeable}} qualities; and so by degrees writing became not merely a sign of folly and a distracted mind but was of practical importance.|$|E
25|$|The {{work has}} come under some criticism. It is felt by some, such as human rights activist Abdullah Hamadi, that the empty niches should be left as monuments to the {{fanaticism}} of the Taliban, while NPR reported that others believe the <b>money</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> better spent on housing and electricity for the region. Some people, including Habiba Sarabi, the provincial governor, believe that rebuilding the Buddhas would increase tourism which would aid the surrounding communities.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea for}} the tour came from William Pickering, a former player who had emigrated to Canada in 1852 and first captained Canada against the United States the {{following}} year. Together with Robert Waller from St George's Cricket Club, Pickering opened discussions for a possible tour in 1856 but financial problems meant that it was three years before the <b>money</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> raised. The English team required a guarantee of £600, which Pickering obtained through the Montreal Cricket Club, Hamilton Cricket Club and St George's Cricket Club.|$|E
25|$|The {{report also}} {{rejected}} the suggestion to allow solicitors rights of {{audience in the}} High Court The report concluded {{that the practice of}} law was a profession, and that a profession had to be independent of government, because without independence the interests of a client cannot be a primary consideration. It did not challenge the existing professional self-regulation through organisations such as the Law Society and Bar Council. The Commission did recommend an examination of the court and legal procedures to see if time and <b>money</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> saved for the parties involved.|$|E
25|$|The People's Budget of 1909, {{championed by}} David Lloyd George and fellow liberal Winston Churchill, {{introduced}} unprecedented {{taxes on the}} wealthy in Britain and radical social welfare programmes to the country's policies. It was the first budget with the expressed intent of redistributing wealth among the public. It imposed increased taxes on luxuries, liquor, tobacco, incomes, and land, – taxation that disproportionately affected the rich – so that <b>money</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> made available for new welfare programmes {{as well as new}} battleships. In 1911 Lloyd George succeeded in putting through Parliament his National Insurance Act, making provision for sickness and invalidism, and this was followed by his Unemployment Insurance Act.|$|E

50|$|Under the Leonard Foundation terms, boursaries {{were made}} {{available}} to students who were white, British subjects, and Protestant {{and no more than}} one-quarter of the <b>moneys</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> awarded to females. The goal was to provide financial assistance to needy students who showed the promise of becoming leading citizens of the British Empire. A complaint filed against the Leonard Foundation under the Ontario Human Rights Code in 1986 prompted litigation. The Ontario Court of Appeal held in 1990, that the trust’s exclusionary terms relating to race, religion, nationality, and gender were contrary to law.|$|R
25|$|At the 24 November 2014 council meeting, Painter {{moved to}} reconsider the agreement. The council {{unanimously}} rejected the land deal after Fruin recused himself from the vote. The council then discussed other potential uses for the money despite prior statements by senator Bill Brady that the <b>money</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> reallocated to other communities in his district {{if it was not}} used to expand McGraw Park. Renner stated that the grant could be used for any Bloomington parks or trails. According to Brady, the money was directed solely toward McGraw Park at the direction of former Bloomington mayor Steve Stockton. Stockton disputed this characterization, stating that he had discussed alternative uses for the money.|$|E
25|$|On a {{visit to}} Pakistan in 2015, Rice warned Pakistani {{political}} and military leaders that attacks in Afghanistan by militants based in Pakistan threatened regional security. Rice also delivered an invitation from President Obama for Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to visit the United States in October. The meetings came at a tense time for Pakistan's relations with neighboring Afghanistan and archrival India, along with uncertainty over whether the United States would release $300 million in military aid to Pakistan. Media reports suggested the <b>money</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> held back if the United States determined Pakistan was {{not doing enough to}} combat the Haqqani network, accused of some of the deadliest attacks in neighboring Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|Finally, in {{the summer}} of 1981 Joe Boyd signed the Thompsons to his small Hannibal label, and in November of that year the Thompsons went back into the studio and {{recorded}} a new album. Boyd's proposal, which the Thompsons accepted, was that the album be recorded {{in a matter of days}} so that <b>money</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> put aside for a tour of the USA. The resulting Shoot Out the Lights included fresh recordings of six songs that had been recorded during the Rafferty-sponsored sessions and two newer songs. Linda Thompson was several months pregnant when the album was recorded and so there was no prospect of an immediate release or supporting tour. By the time the album was released Richard and Linda Thompson’s marriage was over.|$|E

25|$|The county {{governor}} requested {{from the}} bank director of Kreditbanken for the money at 05:45, who responded that the <b>money</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> delivered at the earliest at 07:30. This was relayed to the hijackers at 06:56, who stated that they would continue {{to wait for the}} money. It arrived at 07:29 and negotiations started concerning how the money be handed over. The police demanded release of hostages first, which the hijackers refused. At the time the police were mostly concerned about the threat of the aircraft flying to a foreign location rather than it being blown up in Malmö. The engines were started up and departure procedures commenced. A new offer came from the hijackers and between 08:28 and 08:35 the exchange of passengers and money took place. None of the crew were released.|$|E
25|$|At {{that time}} orchid seed {{germination}} was traditionally a {{hit or miss}} affair, and the single biggest factor preventing orchid growing from moving from being a rich-man’s hobby to a business where <b>money</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> made. Irregular and irreproducible germination seriously hampered the speed and success rate of Mead’s hybridization efforts, {{and it was not}} uncommon for him to have to wait 10 or more years before a new orchid bloomed for the first time, in one instance taking 17 years. But Mead was a patient man, employing scientific principles and keeping detailed and careful notes. His horticultural notebook in the Michael A. Spencer Collection on Theodore Mead, Special Collections and University Archives, University of Central Florida, lists several thousand crosses as well as information on all his other plants. In addition, he photographed many of his new creations.|$|E
25|$|The {{conflict}} {{had been}} unforeseen, and no <b>money</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> appropriated for the expense. With the state's credit in ruins, {{the prospect of}} borrowing money for such purposes from out-of-state lenders was unlikely. With the legislature out of session and the state's coffers empty, Whitcomb had no funds for the enterprise. On May 26, Whitcomb took a personal loan, on his own credit, for $10,000 from the Bank of Indiana's Madison branch, which he used to purchase arms for the state's regiments. The same day he sent letters to other branches of the bank requesting equivalent loans from them, which allowed the state to muster the five regiments that had been requested by the Federal Government. Once the General Assembly convened, they repaid what he had paid from his own pocket and assumed his outstanding debts to the bank. For {{his role as a}} war-time governor, a bronze statue of Whitcomb was placed in Monument Circle in Indianapolis.|$|E

25|$|Unjust {{enrichment}} is seen {{to underlie}} a final group of constructive trust cases, although this remains controversial. In Chase Manhattan Bank NA v Israel-British Bank (London) Ltd Goulding J held that a bank that mistakenly paid money to another bank had a claim to the money back under a constructive trust. Mistake would typically {{be seen as an}} unjust enrichment claim today, and there is no debate over whether the <b>money</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> claimed back in principle. It was, however, questioned whether the claim for the money back should be proprietary in nature, and so whether a constructive trust should arise, particularly if this would bind third parties (for instance, if the recipient bank had gone insolvent). In Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC Lord Browne-Wilkinson held that a constructive trust could only arise if the recipient's conscience would have been affected {{at the time of the}} receipt or before any third party's rights had intervened. In this way, it is controversial whether unjust enrichment underlies any constructive trusts at all, although it remains unclear why someone's conscience being affected should make any difference.|$|E

Housemates in Big Brother 2005 and Big Brother 2006 were given opportunities to regain lost prize money in special Friday Night Live events named: The Prize Fight. Big Brother 2007 was advertised as having no prize money available to the winner of that series. Later, when the series began, it was revealed that prize <b>money</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> accumulated upon the successful completion of tasks. The prize money at the end of the series stood at $450,000. In Big Brother 2008, the prize money was not mentioned until halfway through the series, eventually being revealed as $250,000.
