5|$|Denmark's Flexicurity <b>model</b> <b>features</b> some of {{the most}} {{flexible}} hiring and firing legislation in Europe, providing attractive conditions for foreign investment and international companies looking to locate in Copenhagen. In Dansk Industri's 2013 survey of employment factors in the ninety-six municipalities of Denmark, Copenhagen came in first place for educational qualifications and for the development of private companies in recent years, but fell to 86th place in local companies' assessment of the employment climate. The survey revealed considerable dissatisfaction in the level of dialogue companies enjoyed with the municipal authorities.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Ecore <b>Feature</b> <b>Modeling</b> Plug-in (Ecore. fmp) is a {{tool for}} editing and instantiating class <b>models</b> as <b>feature</b> <b>models.</b> The tool interprets a class <b>model</b> as a <b>feature</b> <b>model</b> and an object <b>model</b> as a <b>feature</b> configuration, thus exposing the {{variability}} aspect of class models. Furthermore, the tool supports instantaneous synchronization between class <b>models</b> and <b>feature</b> <b>models</b> so that the changes made to one model are propagated to the other model. In this report, we describe a bi-directional mapping between class and object <b>models</b> to <b>feature</b> <b>models</b> and configurations that is needed for synchronization. We argue that both class <b>modeling</b> and cardinality-based <b>feature</b> <b>modeling</b> have similar expressive power and we discuss some {{issues related to the}} semantic mismatch between the two notations.

40|$|Four {{essential}} {{developments in}} <b>feature</b> <b>modelling</b> are discussed that solve serious shortcomings in current <b>feature</b> <b>modelling</b> systems. First, in semantic <b>feature</b> <b>modelling,</b> {{it is possible}} to more adequately specify and maintain the meaning of features. Second, in enhanced multiple-view <b>feature</b> <b>modelling,</b> different views on a product are provided, also for conceptual and assembly design. Third, in collaborative <b>feature</b> <b>modelling,</b> several users can collaborate on the development of a product with full <b>feature</b> <b>modelling</b> functionality. Finally, in freeform <b>feature</b> <b>modelling,</b> <b>features</b> with freeform faces are made available. All developments are illustrated with results from research projects at Delft University of Technology, and also future developments are mentioned.

40|$|Curve {{and surface}} fitting find their {{applications}} in various fields {{of science and}} engineering, and, are relevant subjects in coordinate metrology. In this paper, we present two new fitting algorithms for implicit surfaces and plane curves, which minimize the square sum of the orthogonal error distances between the <b>model</b> <b>feature</b> and the given data points. By the new algorithms, the <b>model</b> <b>feature</b> parameters are grouped and simultaneously estimated in terms of form, position, and rotation parameters. The form parameters determine {{the shape of the}} <b>model</b> <b>feature,</b> and the position/rotation parameters describe the rigid body motion of the <b>model</b> <b>feature.</b> The proposed algorithms are applicable to any kind of implicit surface and plane curve.

25|$|The TBM 900 <b>model</b> <b>features</b> several {{ergonomic}} improvements {{within the}} cockpit, increasing both simplicity and automation. A new single power lever integrates the power, propeller and condition lever controls. Various switches and controls, such as some formerly present upon the overhead panel, have been eliminated. The electrical system {{is powered by}} a single main generator, which is supplemented by a belt-driven alternator. On the TBM 900, electrical load distribution changes enable the Garmin G1000 glass cockpit to power up in sync with the switch-on of the battery with little battery drain. The G1000 also has upgraded displays, including an ISA temperature deviation indication, integrated weather radar and MFD map, and automatic landing field elevation inputs to the pressurization controller.|$|E
25|$|Some {{opponents of}} ABC contend that since only few models—subjectively chosen and {{probably}} all wrong—can be realistically considered, ABC analyses provide only limited insight. However, {{there is an}} important distinction between identifying a plausible null hypothesis and assessing the relative fit of alternative hypotheses. Since useful null hypotheses, that potentially hold true, can extremely seldom be put forward in the context of complex models, predictive ability of statistical models as explanations of complex phenomena is far more important than the test of a statistical null hypothesis in this context. It is also common to average over the investigated models, weighted based on their relative plausibility, to infer <b>model</b> <b>features</b> (e.g., parameter values) and to make predictions.|$|E
