5000|$|The {{method of}} <b>measuring</b> <b>screen</b> size by its {{diagonal}} was {{inherited from the}} method used for {{the first generation of}} CRT television, when picture tubes with circular faces were in common use. Being circular, the external diameter of the bulb was used to describe their size. Since these circular tubes were used to display rectangular images, the diagonal measurement of the visible rectangle was smaller than the diameter of the tube due to the thickness of the glass surrounding the phosphor screen (which was hidden from the viewer by the casing and bezel). This method continued even when cathode ray tubes were manufactured as rounded rectangles; it had the advantage of being a single number specifying the size, and was not confusing when the aspect ratio was universally 4:3. In the US, when virtually all TV tubes were 4:3, the size of the screen was given as the true screen diagonal with a V following it (this was a requirement in the US market but not elsewhere). In virtually all other markets, the size of the outer diameter of the tube was given. What was a 27V in the US could be a 28" [...] elsewhere. However the V terminology was frequently dropped in US advertising referring to a 27V as a 27". This was not misleading for the consumer as the seller had to give the actual screen size by law. Flat panel displays by contrast use the actual diagonal of their visible display size, thus the size is the actual size presented to the viewer in all markets. This means that a similarly specified size of display will be larger as a flat panel display compared with a cathode ray tube display.|$|E

30|$|This {{leads us}} to discuss the {{effectiveness}} of our system. Our contribution solely focuses on face-tracking {{because we have a}} long-term goal to use the screen time as a reliable measure. Our current experiment shows that <b>measuring</b> <b>screen</b> time is yet limited, and we need to discuss the accuracy of our system to understand this limitation. Our face-tracking reaches about 61 % precision on the NII-TVRECS dataset (Katayama et al. 2005), for which we estimate an average of 37 % recall (Nguyen et al. 2010; Ngo et al. 2013). This measures the quality of the retrieval of people’s face-tracks, keeping in mind that we had performance constraints so we could applied face-tracking on the whole database. Because we are focusing on annotated face-tracks, we made sure that the subset we are exploring for this paper reach 100 % precision. However, our system still misses a lot of face-tracks due to our low recall.|$|E
