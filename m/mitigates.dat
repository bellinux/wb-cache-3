5|$|The Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey is {{designed}} to document the ﬁrst third of galactic evolution from z = 8 to 1.5 via deep imaging of more than 250,000 galaxies with WFC3/IR and ACS. It will also find the first Type Ia SNe beyond z > 1.5 and establish their accuracy as standard candles for cosmology. Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected; each has multi-wavelength data from Spitzer and other facilities, and has extensive spectroscopy of the brighter galaxies. The use of ﬁve widely separated ﬁelds <b>mitigates</b> cosmic variance and yields statistically robust and complete samples of galaxies down to 109 solar masses out to z ~ 8.|$|E
5|$|Knowing Superman {{could stop}} his plan, Luthor lures {{him to an}} {{underground}} lair, reveals his plan and exposes him to Kryptonite. As Superman weakens, Luthor further taunts him by revealing the first missile is headed toward Hackensack, New Jersey, as even Superman cannot stop both impacts. Eve Teschmacher, Luthor's accomplice, is horrified because her mother lives in Hackensack, but Luthor does not care and leaves Superman to a slow death. Knowing his reputation for keeping his word, Teschmacher rescues Superman on the condition he will deal with the New Jersey missile first. After Superman diverts the missile into outer space, the other one explodes near the San Andreas Fault. He <b>mitigates</b> {{the effects of the}} explosion, getting rid of the fallout and shoring up the crumbling Earth, but the aftershocks damage the Golden Gate Bridge and cause the Hollywood Sign and the Hoover Dam to collapse, endangering lives.|$|E

40|$|Some {{agri-food}} {{managers of}} United States-based companies use strategies to <b>mitigate</b> product-harm crises. The loss of brand and corporate sustainability increases for companies not utilizing <b>mitigating</b> strategies to reduce losses from agri-food product-harm crisis. The {{purpose of this}} multiple case {{study was to explore}} the strategies managers use to <b>mitigate</b> losses from agri-food product-harm crises. Coombs 2 ̆ 7 situational crisis communication theory served as the conceptual framework for this study. A sample of 3 managers from 3 agri-food companies in the southern United States shared their <b>mitigating</b> strategies to reduce losses from a product-harm crisis. Methodological triangulation assisted in reviewing and analyzing information from semistructured interviews, relevant company documents, and journal notes. The use of alphanumeric coding, discovering, and identifying themes, selecting relevant themes, organizing themes in hierarchical order, and linking themes to the phenomenon under study indicated four main themes supporting the benefits of <b>mitigating</b> strategies to reduce losses from an agri-food product-harm crisis. The main themes included the use of pre-crisis <b>mitigating</b> strategies, mid-crisis <b>mitigating</b> strategies, post-crisis <b>mitigating</b> strategies, and high pressure pasteurization (HPP). Findings from this study indicated that agri-food managers use strategies to <b>mitigate</b> product-harm crises, but the added expense of some <b>mitigating</b> strategies often precludes their use. The study findings may contribute to social change by increasing the awareness of agri-food managers, consumers, and company leadership to use <b>mitigating</b> strategies {{to reduce the number of}} illnesses and deaths associated with a product harm crisis...|$|R

5|$|The narrator's tone is {{informal}} and conversational, attempting to conjure {{the picture of}} a dialogue between the reader and the speaker (who is evidently Auden himself, speaking directly in the first person as he does in a large proportion of his work). The informality is established syntactically by enjambment—only 13 of the poem's 93 lines are clearly end-stopped. There are few instances of rhyme, and about half the lines end on unaccented syllables. The lines alternate 13 syllables incorporating five or six accents with 11 syllables and four accents. Auden adapted this syllabic construction from Marianne Moore. The pattern is reinforced by the line indentation and confirmed by Auden's own reading. This structure <b>mitigates</b> the tendency of normally accented English speech to fall into the rhythm of iambic pentameter. Swift changes in the sophistication of diction also occur in the poem, as in conversation, and lend it an immediate, informal quality.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the fish {{communities}} in <b>mitigated</b> and natural mangrove areas in the Port Everglades estuary. This study of fish recolonization of recently (ca. 5 years) planted mangrove forests, tested the null hypothesis that the species composition, size distribution and abundance of fish collected in natural, established and <b>mitigated</b> mangrove environments were the same. Two natural mangrove areas and two <b>mitigated</b> mangrove areas were used as study sites in John U. Lloyd Park. Two natural mangrove areas and two <b>mitigated</b> mangrove areas were used as study sites in West Lake Park. A variety of sampling gear types were utilized in the collection of fishes. Sampling was only done at low tide for all areas. Differences (chi square) in the abundances of fishes occurred between the natural mangrove sites in John U. Lloyd and West Lake Parks. These differences are thought to be due largely to differences in the hydrodynamic environment (i. e. tidal flushing, discharge rates of waterflow) and seasonality (i. e. month). However, differences between the fish communities in the <b>mitigated</b> areas of both parks were not significant at the 0. 05 level of probability. Small fishes, the forage base for the larger piscivores, were equally represented in the <b>mitigated</b> sites throughout the study, and always dominated their respective communities numerically. Differences between natural and <b>mitigated</b> mangrove areas occurred in the distributions of transient species. In general, these transient fishes occurred only in the natural sites: the larval stage of one transient species, however, was found only in the <b>mitigated</b> sites. Likewise, within a species, smaller fishes were generally found in the <b>mitigated</b> sites and larger fishes were found in the natural sites. Thus, differences in the distributions of fishes between the <b>mitigated</b> and natural mangrove sites may be due to food availability as well as structural differences (i. e. spacing of plants) in each habitat. This study shows that <b>mitigated</b> mangrove forests are suitable habitats for small, forage species and presently there are differences in the fish populations in the natural and <b>mitigated</b> mangrove environments, the largest mangrove ecosystem remaining in Broward County...|$|R
50|$|One {{review of}} the CJP data showed that jurors who were asked a {{hypothetical}} question regarding how much certain <b>mitigating</b> factors would influence their sentencing decisions were true, 56.2 percent of the jurors would consider a lesser sentence than death if a history of mental illness was presented as a <b>mitigating</b> factor and 73.6 percent would do so if evidence of mental retardation were presented. However, another {{review of the}} data showed {{the race of the}} victim had a substantial effect on jury failure to find <b>mitigating</b> factors.

50|$|The Supreme Court {{held that}} all {{relevant}} <b>mitigating</b> factors {{must be considered}} in the penalty phase of a death penalty case.

40|$|A {{harmonic}} <b>mitigating</b> transformer {{is capable}} of preventing the propagation of a triplen harmonic current from the secondary side of the transformer to the primary side. The transformer is able to achieve this via its zig-zag connected secondary windings. This investigation developed an equivalent circuit model for a harmonic <b>mitigating</b> transformer. The development of the model {{was based on the}} premise that a transformer can be modelled as a network of mutually coupled inductors. The equivalent circuit model was used to evaluate the transformer under ideal and non-ideal coupling conditions. The evaluation revealed that the non-ideal model {{is capable of}} <b>mitigating</b> more that 99 % of the third harmonic current. This result showed that the non-ideal couplings within a harmonic <b>mitigating</b> transformer do not significantly affect its ability to <b>mitigate</b> the third harmonic. Consequently when seeking to optimise the harmonic <b>mitigating</b> transformer the area of focus should be on the couplings between windings on the same core limb rather than on the couplings between windings on adjacent core limbs...|$|R
30|$|The {{inability}} of wind turbines to <b>mitigate</b> or ride through grid disturbances poses new challenges to operation stability in electric power systems [7]. Small signal or large signal disturbances also cause stability problems in conventional electric power systems. Based on dynamic {{characteristics of the}} load, the process to secure operation stability involves disturbance identification, dynamic control of generations, special protection schemes for system security, etc. Dynamic control of generations responds to disturbances in three ways: active power responses to <b>mitigate</b> phase disturbance, active power responses to <b>mitigate</b> frequency disturbance, and reactive power responses to <b>mitigate</b> voltage disturbance. With large-scale wind generation in the system, the net dynamics of generations exhibits two new features: decreasing ability to <b>mitigate</b> disturbances and decreasing ability to survive disturbances. The study shows that these features first impact voltage stability at the interconnection and further impact angle and frequency stability of the system when the penetration level grows. Large-scale integration of wind therefore requires a substantial increase of the ability of wind plants to <b>mitigate</b> and survive grid disturbances.|$|R

25|$|Any p–n junction, if illuminated, is {{potentially}} a photodiode. Semiconductor {{devices such as}} diodes, transistors and ICs contain p–n junctions, and will not function correctly if they are illuminated by unwanted electromagnetic radiation (light) of wavelength suitable to produce a photocurrent; this is avoided by encapsulating devices in opaque housings. If these housings are not completely opaque to high-energy radiation (ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma rays), diodes, transistors and ICs can malfunction due to induced photo-currents. Background radiation from the packaging is also significant. Radiation hardening <b>mitigates</b> these effects.|$|E
40|$|Why should {{differences}} between regulatory and accounting policies be <b>mitigated?</b> Because <b>mitigating</b> such differences could facilitate convergence – {{as well as}} financial stability. The paper “Fair Value Accounting and Procyclicality: <b>Mitigating</b> Regulatory and Accounting Policy Differences through Regulatory Structure Reforms and Enforced Self Regulation” illustrates how the implementation of accounting standards and policies, in certain instances, have contrasted with Basel Committee initiatives aimed at <b>mitigating</b> procyclicality and facilitating forward looking provisioning.
