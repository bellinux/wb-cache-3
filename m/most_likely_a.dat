5|$|In {{view of the}} {{scarcity}} of sources concerning Shepseskare, nothing is known for certain about his relation to his predecessors. He was <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>a</b> member of the royal family, although {{the possibility that he}} was a usurper unrelated to his predecessors cannot be totally excluded.|$|E
5|$|Sabotage by {{a disgruntled}} crewman. While no {{individual}} was {{named in the}} commission's final report, its conclusion was {{that the cause of}} the explosion was <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>a</b> crewman in No. 3 turret who had recently been accused of theft and was believed to be suicidal.|$|E
5|$|According to Ottfried Neubecker, the bey of Tunis {{also had}} his own flag. This flag was <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>a</b> simple {{personal}} banner of the ruler, as it floated above the Bardo Palace, the Citadel of Tunis, on navy ships, {{and also in the}} center of the coat of arms in Tunisia. It was used at a number of public ceremonies—including at the proclamation of the Ottoman constitution on 21 March 1840—until the abolition of the Bey monarchy on 25 July 1957.|$|E

5|$|Cynesige perhaps {{came from}} Rutland, as {{he owned the}} manor of Tinwell there later in life. The Liber Eliensis claimed {{that he had been}} born by Caesarian section, but this is <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>a</b> later {{accretion}} to his lifestory, added after his death because of efforts to have him declared a saint. The belief was that for an infant to survive a caesarian section was a miracle, and thus a fitting beginning for a future saint.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 581 is {{classified}} as a variable star of the BY Draconis type, and has been given the variable star designation HO Librae. This is a star that exhibits variability {{because of the presence}} of star spots combined with the rotation of the star. However, the measured variability is close to the margin of error, and, if real, is <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>a</b> long term variability. Its brightness is stable to 1%. Gliese 581 emits X-rays.|$|E
5|$|In a 1974 {{review of}} Miocene European talpids, John Howard Hutchison {{wrote that the}} astragalus of Veratalpa lacked any {{features}} that would ally it with talpids and commented that it was <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>a</b> rodent. In their 1997 Classification of Mammals, Malcolm McKenna and Susan Bell listed Veratalpa {{as a member of}} Placentalia of uncertain affinities.|$|E

5|$|The first {{description}} of B.nothofagi {{was published in}} 2012 by Jerry A. Cooper and Patrick Leonard. DNA studies of the fungus {{suggest that it is}} a somewhat basal member of the genus Boletopsis. The fungus is <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>a</b> native species of New Zealand and was present there before the arrival of Europeans. As it is very rare and possibly threatened, B.nothofagi is listed in the Red List of Threatened Species as an endangered species.|$|E
5|$|Titanosaurians were {{a flourishing}} group of sauropod dinosaurs during Cretaceous times. The Spanish {{locality}} {{from the latest}} Cretaceous of “Lo Hueco” yielded a relatively well preserved, titanosaurian braincase, which shares a number of unique features with A. atacis from France. However, it appeared to differ from A. atacis in some traits also. The specimen has been provisionally identified as Ampelosaurus sp.; it is <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>a</b> mature titanosaurian since {{the bones of the}} braincase have largely fused together.|$|E
5|$|While Georgian and Classical {{evidence}} {{makes the}} contemporaneous Kartlian {{links with the}} Seleucids plausible (Toumanoff has even implied that the kings of Kartli might have aided the Seleucids in holding the resurgent Orontids of Armenia in check), Pharnavaz's alleged reform of the eristavi fiefdoms is <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>a</b> back-projection of the medieval pattern of subdivision to the remote past.|$|E

5|$|Eta Hydri is {{the other}} optical double, {{composed}} of Eta1 and Eta2. Eta1 is a blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B9V that was suspected of being variable, and is located just over 700 light-years away. Eta2 has a magnitude of 4.7 and is a yellow giant star of spectral type G8.5III around 218 light-years distant, which has evolved off the main sequence and is expanding and cooling {{on its way to}} becoming a red giant. Calculations of its mass indicate it was <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>a</b> white A-type main sequence star for most of its existence, around twice the mass of our Sun. A planet, Eta2 Hydri b, greater than 6.5 times the mass of Jupiter was discovered in 2005, orbiting around Eta2 every 711 days at a distance of 1.93 astronomical units (AU).|$|E
5|$|Further {{research}} has revealed more detail. German records confirmed Specht flew a Fw 190, not a Bf 109, {{and that he}} was a major at the time, confirming Johnson's victim was most likely to have been Engel. Johnson's claim form revealed he had claimed a Bf 109, not an Fw 190. The ID card of Johnson's victim was passed on to a member of the ground crew who spoke German. This individual stated that the rank was given as lieutenant colonel. The incorrect identification was <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>a</b> language error and misunderstanding of German ranks. This may have caused the belief that Johnson had killed Specht. Johnson died in October 1976, and aviation historians were unable to secure his version of events.|$|E
5|$|HIP 78530 b is <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>a</b> brown dwarf, {{a massive}} object that {{is large enough}} to fuse {{deuterium}} (something that planets are too small to do) but not large enough to ignite and become a star. Because HIP 78530 b's characteristics blend the line between {{whether or not it is}} a brown dwarf or a planet, astronomers have tried to determine what HIP 78530 b is by predicting whether it was created in a planet-like or star-like (how brown dwarves are formed) manner.|$|E

5|$|On 6 April 1994, Rwandan President Habyarimana's {{plane was}} shot down near Kigali Airport, killing both Habyarimana and the President of Burundi, Cyprien Ntaryamira, {{as well as their}} entourage and three French crew members. The attackers remain unknown. Historian Gérard Prunier, in a book written shortly after the incident, {{concluded}} that it was <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>a</b> coup d'État carried out by extreme Hutu members of Habyarimana's government, and was a planned part of the genocide. This theory was disputed in 2006 by French judge Jean-Louis Bruguière, and in 2008 by Spanish judge Fernando Andreu. Both alleged that Kagame and the RPF were responsible.|$|E
5|$|Several species coined in genera {{other than}} Allosaurus are also now {{thought to be}} synonymous with A. fragilis. Labrosaurus ferox was named in 1884 by Marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw, with a {{prominent}} gap in the tooth row {{at the tip of}} the jaw, and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down. Later researchers suggested that the bone was pathologic, showing an injury to the living animal, and that part of the unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction. It is recognized as <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>a</b> specimen of A. fragilis.|$|E
5|$|The Suan shu shu {{presents}} basic mathematics {{problems and}} solutions. It was <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>a</b> handbook for day-to-day business transactions or affairs of government administration. It contains problems and solutions for field measurements of area, proportional exchange rates for agricultural millet and rice, distribution by proportion, short width division, and excess and deficiency. Some {{of the problems}} found in the Suan shu shu appear in the later text Jiuzhang suanshu; in five cases, the titles are exact matches. However, unlike the Jiuzhang suanshu, the Suan shu shu does not deal with problems involving right-angle triangles, square roots, cube roots, and matrix methods, which demonstrates the significant advancements made in Chinese mathematics between the writings of these two texts.|$|E

5|$|The {{credence}} {{given to}} the reports was such that Pope Alexander III {{sent a letter to}} Prester John via his physician Philip on September 27, 1177. Nothing more is recorded of Philip, but it is most probable that he did not return with word from Prester John. The Letter continued to circulate, accruing more embellishments with each copy. In modern times, textual analysis of the letter's variant Hebrew versions has suggested an origin among the Jews of northern Italy or Languedoc: several Italian words remained in the Hebrew texts. At any rate, the Letters author was <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>a</b> Westerner, though his or her purpose remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|The first California Diamond Jubilee half dollar struck {{was given}} to the Memorial Museum in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco. The die used for the initial strikings was {{specially}} treated to produce a frosted or cameo effect, which wore down after the first approximately 75 strikings, according to Swiatek in his later volume on commemoratives. Numismatist Kevin Flynn suggests that the first 100 pieces exhibit these special surfaces, and that this was done at Rossi's request for presentation to VIPs. One piece is known without a mint mark; this was <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>a</b> trial piece, prepared and owned by Mint Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock and later sold from his estate.|$|E
5|$|The single known {{example of}} Argentodites is a blade-like fourth lower premolar (p4). It has {{a length of}} 4.15mm, height of 2.10mm, and width of 1.35mm. The crown is nearly complete, but the roots are largely missing. Kielan-Jaworowska {{considered}} two possible orientations of the tooth—one with the back margin nearly vertically, {{and the other with}} the margin inclined backwards—but preferred the former, which made for a more natural placement of the roots. Although the left and right sides of the tooth are almost identical, they believed the tooth is <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>a</b> left p4, as this would make the lingual (inner) side the more convex one, as is usual in the p4 of cimolodontan multituberculates with a large p4.|$|E

50|$|Though Z'Cann was a telepath, Rogue never {{displayed}} {{this power}} (though she did manifest telepathy, {{it was with}} the Phoenix energy form, so it was <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>an</b> echo of Jean Grey's powers).|$|R
