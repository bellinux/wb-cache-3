25|$|With the {{subsidies}} reform plan implemented, many experts {{are hopeful that}} not only will government intervention and price distortions in agricultural products be reduced, but also that a fundamental restructuring {{will take place in}} the agriculture sector. The government has recently quadrupled bread prices as part of the plan and is planning to liberalise the market completely. In addition, the pricing of a number of other products that was previously done by the government is now to be left to the <b>market</b> <b>mechanism.</b> More importantly, fuel, water and electricity prices have increased significantly. The government has still kept prices lowest for agriculture in comparison to household and industrial consumers. Nonetheless, the high level of inefficiency in the agricultural sector from irrigation to harvesting, is expected to be fundamentally reformed and replaced with more efficient and modern technologies.|$|E
25|$|The <b>market</b> <b>mechanism</b> for {{agricultural}} products is not particularly developed given the traditional nature of the agricultural sector and the numerous governmental interventions in the market prices. The market mainly consists {{of a large number}} of retail traders who purchase the crops from the farmers in small quantities and bring them to the major traders in the bazaar, which is the system that was the predecessor to the modern markets. In order to improve market efficiency and transparency, the Iranian government has allowed trading of agricultural products on the Iran Mercantile Exchange (IME) for the past seven years. More than 22 different agricultural products are currently traded on the IME and the trading volume for them is approximately 200,000 tonnes per annum. Nonetheless, given the direct impact of the prices of agricultural products on people’s daily lives and welfare, the government actively intervenes in the market by setting prices, importing products in large amounts, subsidising certain products, and restricting exports in order to supply domestic demand.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} three decennia, many governments have {{introduced}} <b>market</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in education. They have done so by enhancing parental choice and encouraging school competition, through policies like abolishing catchment areas, creating voucher programmes and setting up charter schools. These <b>market</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{have given rise to}} fierce debates in both political and scientific circles. However, most prior reviews of research literature in this area have concluded that the effects of <b>market</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in education are small, if they are found at all. This review tries to answer the question why that is the case, by analysing the causal pathways that link <b>market</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to educational outcomes and by reviewing the empirical evidence for each step along those causal pathways. The findings of this review point to the need for a nuanced and qualified discussion about <b>market</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in education. What <b>market</b> <b>mechanisms</b> mean in actual practice strongly depends on (local) contexts, while the impact of <b>market</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is related to other policies impacting on parental choice behaviour as well as actions taken by schools...|$|R

25|$|Raising {{the price}} of carbon will achieve four goals. First, it will provide signals to {{consumers}} about what goods and services are high-carbon ones and should therefore be used more sparingly. Second, it will provide signals to producers about which inputs use more carbon (such as coal and oil) and which use less or none (such as natural gas or nuclear power), thereby inducing firms to substitute low-carbon inputs. Third, it will give market incentives for inventors and innovators to develop and introduce low-carbon products and processes that can replace {{the current generation of}} technologies. Fourth, and most important, a high carbon price will economize on the information that is required to do all three of these tasks. Through the <b>market</b> <b>mechanism,</b> a high carbon price will raise {{the price of}} products according to their carbon content. Ethical consumers today, hoping to minimize their “carbon footprint,” have little chance of making an accurate calculation of the relative carbon use in, say, driving 250 miles as compared with flying 250 miles. A harmonized carbon tax would raise the price of a good proportionately to exactly the amount of CO2 that is emitted in all the stages of production that are involved in producing that good. If 0.01 of a ton of carbon emissions results from the wheat growing and the milling and the trucking and the baking of a loaf of bread, then a tax of $30 per ton carbon will raise the price of bread by $0.30. The “carbon footprint” is automatically calculated by the price system. Consumers would still not know how much of the price is due to carbon emissions, but they could make their decisions confident that they are paying for the social cost of their carbon footprint.|$|E
500|$|Alternatively, SRECs {{allow for}} a <b>market</b> <b>mechanism</b> to set {{the price of the}} solar {{generated}} electricity subsity. [...] In this mechanism, a renewable energy production or consumption target is set, and the utility (more technically the Load Serving Entity) is obliged to purchase renewable energy or face a fine (Alternative Compliance Payment or ACP). The producer is credited for an SREC for every 1,000kWh of electricity produced. If the utility buys this SREC and retires it, they avoid paying the ACP. In principle this system delivers the cheapest renewable energy, since the all solar facilities are eligible and can be installed in the most economic locations. [...] Uncertainties about the future value of SRECs have led to long-term SREC contract markets to give clarity to their prices and allow solar developers to pre-sell and hedge their credits.|$|E

2500|$|Hayek's {{principal}} {{investigations in}} economics concerned capital, money, {{and the business}} cycle. Mises had earlier applied the concept of marginal utility {{to the value of}} money in his Theory of Money and Credit (1912), in which he also proposed an explanation for [...] "industrial fluctuations" [...] based on the ideas of the old British Currency School and of Swedish economist Knut Wicksell. Hayek used this body of work {{as a starting point for}} his own interpretation of the business cycle, elaborating what later became known as the [...] "Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle". Hayek spelled out the Austrian approach in more detail in his book, published in 1929, an English translation of which appeared in 1933 as Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle. There he argued for a monetary approach to the origins of the cycle. In his Prices and Production (1931), Hayek argued that the business cycle resulted from the central bank's inflationary credit expansion and its transmission over time, leading to a capital misallocation caused by the artificially low interest rates. Hayek claimed that [...] "the past instability of the market economy is the consequence of the exclusion of the most important regulator of the <b>market</b> <b>mechanism,</b> money, from itself being regulated by the market process".|$|E
