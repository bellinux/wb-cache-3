The activated charcoal was added to the back-up stucco from 0 to 30 % by weight. The microwave heating tests were carried out from 5 to 20 minutes. The dielectric properties of the green mould and the wax were measured using a co-axial dielectric end probe. It was found that the loss factor of the wax is low, and the higher the percentage of activated charcoal added into the mould, the better the dielectric loss factor and the lower the dewaxing time.

40|$|Aiming at the {{cracking}} {{phenomenon of}} the thin shell mould in the expendable pattern shell casting during the pattern removing process, some systemic researches are presented. The influence of the pattern removing method and temperature on the pattern removing were investigated. The shell <b>mould</b> <b>cracking</b> mechanism was analyzed by using thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), and combining the temperature field and the volume change of the expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam pattern being tested. The {{results indicated that the}} shell mould was not easily cracked when the pattern removing process was carried out with the furnace being heated little by little because of the shell slowly shrinking with dehydration and shell strength gradually increasing. The shell mould was soon destroyed when it was set directly into the furnace at above 400 ℃ because of the thin shell mould rapidly shrinking and the foam pattern hindering. However, the shell <b>mould</b> had no <b>cracking</b> when it had been preheated for a long time even if the furnace temperature was above 400 篊 and the shell was put into the furnace directly. Moreover, when the shell mould was directly set into the furnace at lower temperatures, 250 to 300 ℃, the shell would shrink slowly and the foam pattern would stay at the maximum expansion stage temperature of 100 to 110 ℃ for a long time; and the shell mould would experience an expansion force from the foam pattern for a long time. The expansion force is related to the pattern removing temperature, holding time, foam pattern thickness and density. Therefore, the foam pattern with higher density could make the shell crack...|$|R

The investigations were carried out to establish the physical and collapsibility characteristics of an H-shape pattern produced from two different construction methods, i. e. hollow and solid, using rapid prototyping FDM 2000 machine. Surface roughness, dimensional accuracy and distortion were evaluated to establish the physical characteristics of the pattern constructed. Results on surface roughness showed no significant variation between hollow and solid constructed patterns. As for dimensional accuracy, hollow patterns produced better accuracy compared to solid patterns. However, the result on distortion shows that hollow constructed patterns experienced 33. 11 % higher than solid constructed patterns. For collapsibility investigation, shell investment casting mould built from the two different pattern construction methods were fired to a temperature ranging from 300 °C to 600 °C. The moulds were weighted at a predetermine temperature intervals to establish the collapsibility characteristic of the patterns.

40|$|For the {{die casting}} {{conditions}} of aluminium bronzes assumed {{based on the}} literature data, a thick-walled bush was cast, made of complex aluminium bronze (Cu-Al-Fe-Ni-Cr). After the cast {{was removed from the}} <b>mould,</b> <b>cracks</b> were observed inside it. In order to identify the stage in the technological production process at which, potentially, the formation of stresses damaging the continuity of the microstructure created in the cast was possible (hot cracking and/or cold cracking), a computer simulation was performed. The article presents the results of the computer simulation of the process of casting the material into the gravity die as well as solidifying and cooling of the cast {{in the shape of a}} thick-walled bush. The simulation was performed with the use of the MAGMA 5 program and by application of the CuAl 10 Ni 5, 5 Fe 4, 5 alloy from the MAGMA 5 program database. The results were compared with the location of the defects identified in the actual cast. As a result of the simulation of the die-casting process of this bush, potential regions were identified where significant principal stresses accumulate, which can cause local hot and cold cracking. Until now, no research has been made of die-cast aluminium bronzes with a Cr addition. Correlating the results of the computer simulation validated by the analysis of the actual cast made it possible to clearly determine the critical regions in the cast exposed to cracking and point to the causes of its occurrence. Proposals of changes in the bush die casting process were elaborated, in order to avoid hot tearing and cold cracking.

40|$|Nowadays a vast {{majority}} of the steel produced worldwide is via the continuous casting process route because this is the most low-cost, efficient and high quality method to mass produce metal products in a variety of sizes and shapes. Most of the continuous casters are the initial manufacturing step of a product which is very close to the final shape, reducing the need for further finishing. During continuous casting the liquid steel is solidified under controlled conditions of heat extraction to a semi-finished product that can subsequently be processed until final shape is reached. However, there is no perfect process and cracking during solidification of continuously cast steel slabs {{has been one of the}} main problems in casting for many years. In literature many terms are used for the phenomenon of crack formation at temperatures close to the solidus temperature, e. g. hot tearing, hot shortness, hot cracking or solidification cracking. Regardless of the name, hot tears represent a failure that occurs during casting in the regions of a solidifying slab that are at temperatures between solidus (TS) and liquidus (TL) and are subjected to simultaneously acting tensile and compressive stresses. The three steel grades considered in this study are a Low carbon aluminium killed (LCAK) steel grade, a high strength low alloyed (HSLA) steel grade, micro-alloyed with extra additions of vanadium, nitrogen and niobium, and a low-range HSLA (LR-HSLA), with the same concentration of niobium but a lower concentration of vanadium and nitrogen. The purpose of this study has been to investigate the differences between these three steel grades, with respect to hot tearing sensitivity upon solidifying in a thin slab caster. This research originates from the industrial demand for defect-free high-speed casting of steels and this thesis focuses on the thermo-mechanical behaviour of steel grades in relation to the solidification conditions in the continuous casting mould. Although these steel grades are not very different in chemical composition, thermodynamic calculations showed that the two HSLA steel grades have different propensity to the peritectic reaction upon solidification due to the combination of elements in the chemical composition that are either ferrite or austenite stabilisers. In order to better understand the special behaviour of the HSLA grade, compared with the LR-HSLA and the potential precipitation of TiN, phase field microstructure simulations have been performed, showing that TiN can form already during the latest stage of solidification, even when very low amounts of this element are present. If TiN particles trigger the coalescence of dendrite trunks, then it is possible to understand why, for a given Ti content an increased N content present in the HSLA grade can help to reduce the risk of hot tearing. Segregating elements in steel can influence the hot tearing susceptibility as they can widen the brittle temperature range (?TB), displacing its lower limit to lower temperatures. Unique hot tensile tests were carried out in the temperature range involving solidification, where the results suggest that among the studied steel grades, the LCAK steel grade has the lowest strength during solidification and a broader ?TB. Fractographic studies of the samples fractures above the non-equilibrium solidus revealed low melting phases even at temperatures as low as 1360 ºC. These low-melting films do have an effect on the hot tearing behaviour of commercial steel grades. The LCAK is particularly prone to develop non-metallic particles at the last stages of solidification. Whilst the study with the <b>Mould</b> <b>Cracking</b> Simulator did not confirm the increased hot tearing susceptibility of the LCAK and LR-HSLA, it did partially substantiate that the modifications on its design are novel in the way that no other physical model of cracking during continuous casting is able to simulate the process in such a way that it resembles the industrial process. Despite the alloys tested during the first few experiments were not the same alloy compositions studied in this thesis, the results of the <b>Mould</b> <b>Cracking</b> Simulator are very promising. It is expected that this new physical model will help in the study of the thermomechanical properties of commercial steels motivated by the continuous trend towards improved casting productivity by increasing casting speed and higher quality, as well as for the development of new steel grades.

Rapid prototyping of gears with complex tooth forms is {{possible with the}} use of modern methods. One of such methods is the stereo-lithography, where a pattern is obtained as a result of resin curing with laser beam. Patterns of that type are applicable in precision casting. Removing of stereo-lithographic pattern from foundry mould requires use of high temperatures. Resin burning would generate significant amounts of harmful gases. In case of a solid stereo-lithographic pattern, the pressure created during gas burning may cause the <b>mould</b> to <b>crack.</b> A gas volume reduction may be achieved by using patterns of honeycomb structure. However, this technique causes a significant worsening of accuracy of stereo-lithographic patterns in respect of their dimensions and shape. In cooperation with WSK PZL Rzeszów, the Machine Design Department of Rzeszow University of Technology carried out research on the design of hybrid stereo-lithographic patterns. Hybrid pattern consists of a section made by stereo-lithographic process and a section made of casting wax. The latter material is used for stereo-lithographic pattern filling and for mould gating system. The hybrid pattern process consists of two stages: wax melting and then the burn-out of stereolithographic pattern. Use of hybrid patterns reduces the costs of production of stereolithographic patterns. High dimensional accuracy remains preserved in this process...|$|R

40|$|Laminated cryptalgal carbonates {{occur in}} the Precambrian Copper Harbor Conglomerate of {{northern}} Michigan, which was deposited in the Keweenawan Trough, an aborted proto-oceanic rift. This unit is composed of three major facies deposited by braided streams on a large alluvial-fan complex. Coarse clastics were deposited in braided channels, predominantly as longitudinal bars, whereas cross-bedded sandstones were deposited by migrating dunes or linguoid bars. Fine-grained overbank deposits accumulated in abandoned channels. Gypsum <b>moulds</b> and carbonate-filled <b>cracks</b> suggest an arid climate during deposition. Stromatolites interstratified with these clastic facies occur as laterally linked drapes over cobbles, as laterally linked contorted beds in mudstone, as oncolites, and as poorly developed mats in coarse sandstones. Stromatolites also are interbedded with oolitic beds and intraclastic conglomerates. Stromatolitic microstructure consists of alternating detrital and carbonate laminae, and open-space structures. Radial-fibrous calcite fans are superimposed on the laminae. The laminae are interpreted as algal in origin, whereas {{the origin of the}} radial fibrous calcite is problematic. The stromatolites are inferred to have grown in lakes which occupied abandoned channels on the fan surface.
