The gradient is smaller for those who may feel protected by wind direction and topographical conditions, and it differs by age, sex, {{and the level of}} education.

40|$|Modern {{society is}} {{characterized}} by the growth of new, technologically manufactured risks which follow human progress and innovation. Nuclear technology is an example of such human-induced sources of <b>risks.</b> <b>Nuclear</b> <b>risk</b> or the risk of radioactive contamination is a transboundary risk {{in the sense that it}} crosses the boundaries of nation-states uninvited, being transported by air, wind and water. This thesis explores how nation-states cooperate to manage transboundary <b>nuclear</b> <b>risks.</b> The focus is on Norway and the efforts made by Norwegian authorities since the early 1990 ’s to reduce transboundary <b>nuclear</b> <b>risk</b> stemming from <b>nuclear</b> technologies and activities in Northwest Russia. The thesis aims to explore what approach or combination of approaches a state can use during its cooperation with other states in order to successfully manage and reduce transboundary <b>nuclear</b> <b>risk.</b> The role of non-governmental and intergovernmental organizations in international cooperation on <b>nuclear</b> <b>risk</b> reduction is also analyzed. My findings show that in order to reduce transboundary <b>nuclear</b> <b>risk</b> a state can apply three support approaches both in regional cooperation with the neighbouring states, but also on a more global level, involving international organizations and other states. First, by using the approach of collective learning, a state can gather information and knowledge on the risk at stake and thus define what needs to be done. Second, a state can provide technical and financial assistance to the state which is the risk manufacturer. However, to control that the assistance is used as it is supposed to, the risk of implementation failure must be addressed as well. Thus the compliance control approach is the third approach that needs to be applied. When it comes to international organizations, the thesis shows that both NGOs and IGOs can serve as forums for collective learning and creation of consensual knowledge on the risk at stake. However, while IGOs, just as nation-states, can provide technical/financial assistance to the risk source country, NGOs are more suitable to serve as creative mediators during negotiations of intergovernmental agreements on <b>nuclear</b> <b>risk</b> reduction. Nevertheless, it is not sure that the combination of these support approaches is enough to address the risk of ineffective abatement: the possibility that all the measures undertaken still will not lead to successful risk reduction, even when there is no implementation failure...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{main purpose}} of this study is to develop a {{methodology}} for a multidisciplinary <b>nuclear</b> <b>risk</b> and vulnerability assessment, and to test this methodology through estimation of a <b>nuclear</b> <b>risk</b> to population in the Northern European countries in case of a severe accident at the <b>nuclear</b> <b>risk</b> sites. For assessment of the probabilistic risk and vulnerability, a combination of social-geophysical factors and probabilities are considered. The main focus of this paper is the description of methodology for evaluation of the atmospheric transport of radioactive releases from the risk site regions based on the long-term trajectory modeling. The suggested methodology is given from the probabilistic point of view. The main questions stated are: What are probabilities and times for radionuclide atmospheric transport to different neighbouring countries and territories in case of the hypothetical accidental release at the <b>nuclear</b> <b>risk</b> site? Which geographical territories or countries are at the highest risk from the hypothetical accidental releases? To answer these questions we suggest applying the following research tools for probabilistic atmospheric studies. First tool is atmospheric modelling to calculate multiyear forward trajectories originated over the sites. Second tool is statistical analyses to explore temporal and spatial structure of calculated trajectories and evaluate different probabilistic impact indicators: atmospheric transport pathways, airflow, fast transport, typical transport time, maximum possible impact zone, maximum reaching distance, etc. These indicators are applicable for further GIS-analysis and integration to estimate regional risk and vulnerability in case of accidental releases at the risk sites and for planning the emergency response and preparedness systems...|$|R

40|$|Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) are {{potentially}} vulnerable to accidents, which {{can either be}} internally or externally initiated. External events include natural events like tornadoes, hurricanes, and earthquakes. The purpose of this thesis is to understand the characteristics of public risks arising due to a severe external event, in this case an earthquake, which affects the public both directly and via damage to a nuclear power plant. The possibility of developing a comparison basis for the risks from these two events is also investigated. Using the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant PRA as a case study, consequences of a seismically induced <b>nuclear</b> <b>risk</b> are evaluated. Bases of comparison with direct seismic risks in Seabrook and Boston, calculated using FEMA's HAZUS program, are then analyzed. Results obtained show that the <b>nuclear</b> <b>risks</b> contribute little to the background risks from the direct earthquakes. Some consequences such as prompt fatality from the direct effect of earthquakes are 100 to 500 times bigger than the risks from the seismically induced <b>nuclear</b> <b>risks</b> at different magnitudes of earthquakes. Other consequences used for comparison include injuries and economic damage. Comparative analyses of the direct earthquake risks and the seismically induced <b>nuclear</b> <b>risks</b> present a good means of communicating the risks posed to the public. Easily understandable, these comparative analyses can be utilized in making societal decisions about risks. Based on {{the results from the}} comparisons, risk informed policies for keeping the seismically induced <b>nuclear</b> <b>risks</b> low are proposed, including keeping the ratio of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>risks</b> to the direct effect risks to a level based on societal decisions. The results and proposals obtained were presented to a panel of experts who also suggested the use of the 3 -region approach in making the nuclear power plants safe. Considering events like the Turkey Point NPP experience with Hurricane Andrew, existing plans in place, such as communication and transportation after a major event, are considered. Noting that an earthquake that is strong enough to damage a NPP will affect much of the infrastructure needed to carry out emergency plans, means of strengthening the plans were evaluated. It was concluded {{that there has to be}} more cooperation among the different levels of government and the NPPs should be allowed a more active role in the policy and plan development for the safety of the public in their vicinity. by Olubukola Afolayan Jejeloye.

40|$|The disappointingly {{slow pace}} of {{progress}} on efforts to prevent proliferation, reduce nuclear weapons, and eliminate <b>nuclear</b> <b>risks</b> has many causes. The factor that might be easiest for individuals in the arms control and nonproliferation community to change stems from their own ambivalence about major questions {{that must be addressed}} on the road to reducing the number of nuclear weapons in the world to zero. This essay explores how ambivalence about four key issues—strategic stability, alliance relations, institution-building, and nuclear energy—often leads community members to take positions that play well at home and within their like-minded group but raise unintended impediments to achieving their own long-term goals. The author suggests alternative ways to handle these questions to improve the prospects for domestic and international agreement on practical measures that would eliminate, not perpetuate, <b>nuclear</b> <b>risks...</b>|$|R

The study collected data 11-133 weeks after the events from 844 young respondents in three regions of Japan; Miyagi, Yokyo, and Western Japan. The study showed that there were shared normative concerns about the earthquake and <b>nuclear</b> <b>risks</b> along with conservation values, lack of trust in government aid and advice, and poor personal control of the nuclear incident. All of these were positively correlated with perceived earthquake and <b>nuclear</b> <b>risks.</b> Many of these perceptions predicted specific outcomes, such as leaving their homes or even Japan.|$|R
