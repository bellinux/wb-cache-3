50|$|<b>Krister</b> <b>Andersson</b> (born 3 May 1951 in Eskilstuna, Sweden) is a Swedish {{musician}} (tenor saxophone, alt saxophone and clarinet) and composer.|$|R
50|$|Andersson is {{involved}} in a large number of jazz records in the Nordic countries and in Tanglewood, Massachusetts. He leads his <b>Krister</b> <b>Andersson</b> Quartet and often collaborates as guest soloist in other constellations. He is regarded as a brilliant improvizer and plays with a modern neo-bop style and is still a sought after classic soloist.|$|R
50|$|In late 1960's {{he started}} his own Ivar Antonsen Trio {{including}} Espen Rud (drums) and alternately Terje Venaas, Sture Janson and Bjørn Alterhaug on bass. His strong contribution to guitarist Thorgeir Stubø's album Flight (1985) can be cited as {{a good example of}} Antonsen's sophisticated style. Here you can enjoy the hard swinging interaction with Thorgeir Stubø, Alex Riel (drums), <b>Krister</b> <b>Andersson</b> (tenor saxophone) and Jesper Lundgaard (double bass).|$|R
25|$|On the two last records Stubø was on {{the label}} Cadence Jazz Records. First came the LP Rhythm'a'ning (Cadence Jazz Records, 1986), live in Tromsø, with <b>Krister</b> <b>Andersson,</b> Lars Sjösten, Terje Venaas and Egil Johansen, (Cadence Jazz Records, 1986). This is a stylish and very {{consistent}} release, with many tunes by John Coltrane. The end of a tune (Cadence Jazz Records, 1988), with Art Farmer, Doug Raney, Ivar Antonsen, Jesper Lundgaard and Ole Jacob Hansen, {{marked the end of}} an extraordinary career.|$|R
50|$|He has {{performed}} with or recorded with Pepper Adams, <b>Krister</b> <b>Andersson,</b> Reid Anderson, Ed Bickert, Paul Bley, Don Braden, Terry Clarke, Avishai Cohen, Al Cohn, Scott Colley, Buddy DeFranco, Ray Drummond, Phil Dwyer, Charles Fambrough, Jerry Fuller, George Garzone, Mick Goodrick, Jimmy Giuffre, Bill Goodwin, Drew Gress, Al Grey, Craig Handy, Billy Hart, Roy Haynes, Joe Henderson, Joe LaBarbera, Joe Lovano, Mingus Big Band, Red Mitchell, Gene Perla, Ben Perowsky, P. J. Perry, Rich Perry, Dewey Redman, Shorty Rogers, Jim Rotondi, Richard Stoltzman, Ben Street, Neil Swainson, Clark Terry, and Phil Woods.|$|R
50|$|This live album {{recorded}} in Tromsø, {{is perhaps the}} strongest and most consistent of all of Thorgeir Stubø releases. The band works well together, and exercises uncompromising and very hard-swinging bop of high international standing. Saxophonist <b>Krister</b> <b>Andersson</b> stands well in this repertoire, with his harsh tone and highly Coltraneinspirerte performance on this release definitely keep very high international standard. Pianist Lars Sjösten have some minimalist style, where the most improvisations largely based on the design development {{and this is a}} nice contrast to Stubø's and Andersson's more hectic play.|$|R
2500|$|Flight (Hot Club Records 1983, live {{recordings}} from 1983), with <b>Krister</b> <b>Andersson</b> (saxophones), Terje Venaas (bass), Lars Sjösten (piano), Egil Johansen (drums), Ivar Antonsen, Jesper Lundgaard and Alex Riel (drums), {{is a mixed}} studio an live recording from Tromsø {{with different}} line-ups on the two sets. On this album {{there is a clear}} influence of guitarist Pat Martino. By writing letters Stubø got in contact with the well-known guitarist Doug Raney, son of the legendaric Jazz guitarist Jimmy Raney. This led to the album Everything We Love (Hot Club, 1983/1985), with Doug Raney, Ole Jacob Hansen and Jesper Lundgaard ...|$|R
50|$|His {{performing}} career {{started in}} association with Storyville Jazz Club during studies in Boston, in addition to local bands in Bergen (1972-73) where {{he was part of}} «Søbstad/Halvorsens Quintet», and Molde (1973-75) with his own trio and E. A. Sextet, including Alf Kjellman and Torgrim Sollid in the lineup, and for the latter he contributed on the album Østerdalsmusikk (1975). When in the US he played with among others Herb Pomeroy, Bob Mover, Mick Goodrick and Ralph Moore, conducted his own orchestra with the commission to the anniversary concert at the Moldejazz in 1980, and was in the «New Cool Quartet» (1982). Aksdal moved to Oslo and joined the Magni Wentzel Quintet (1975-76). He also played with Bjarne Nerem, Bjørn Johansen with the album Dear Henrik (1986), Harald Gundhus and «Atle Hammer Quintet», Harald Bergersen and <b>Krister</b> <b>Andersson,</b> during his years in Oslo. In addition he composed the commissioned work Sonus in Obscuri, with among others Eldbjørg Raknes for Moldejazz 1995.|$|R
40|$|Referendum {{votes on}} {{adoption}} of the euro in Denmark (2000) and Sweden (2003) provide unprecedented natural experiments through which to study {{the political economy of}} money. Using exit polling data and multinomial logit statistical models that allow us to separate preferences for the euro from preferences for the European Union (EU), we test economic calculation and political community as determinants of individual-level preferences over {{adoption of the}} euro. We find that calculation operates most clearly where, as in Sweden, the choice of a fixed versus a floating exchange rate regime is at stake, while community exerts strong effects across the two cases.
