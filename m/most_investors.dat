25|$|<b>Most</b> <b>investors</b> prefer {{their money}} to be in cash than in less fungible investments. Cash is on hand to be spent {{immediately}} if the need arises, but some investments require time or effort to transfer into spendable form. This is known as liquidity preference. A 1-year loan, for instance, is very liquid compared to a 10-year loan. A 10-year US Treasury bond, however, is liquid because it can easily be sold on the market.|$|E
25|$|Even Michael Steinhardt, {{who made}} his fortune trading in time horizons ranging from 30 minutes to 30 days, claimed to take a {{long-term}} perspective on his investment decisions. From an economic perspective, many professional money managers and financial advisors shy away from day trading, arguing that the reward simply does not justify the risk. Attempting {{to make a profit}} is the reason investors invest, and buy low and sell high is the general goal of <b>most</b> <b>investors</b> (although short-selling and arbitrage take a different approach, {{the success or failure of}} these strategies still depends on timing).|$|E

25|$|McMahon greatly {{expanded}} {{the use of}} arbitration in securities disputes, since many of them take place under the 1934 Act, which regulates the secondary market in which <b>most</b> <b>investors</b> trade. It also signaled a greater acceptance of arbitration as a desirable and fair method of dispute resolution. This was cited by the Court three years later in Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express Inc., when it overturned Wilko completely and held that claims under the 1933 Act could also be arbitrated if the parties had clearly chosen to do so. The expansion in securities arbitration as a result led to reforms during the 1990s to make the process more investor-friendly.|$|E
25|$|Investors, {{including}} {{the likes of}} Warren Buffett, and researchers have disputed the efficient-market hypothesis both empirically and theoretically. Behavioral economists attribute the imperfections in financial markets {{to a combination of}} cognitive biases such as overconfidence, overreaction, representative bias, information bias, and various other predictable human errors in reasoning and information processing. These have been researched by psychologists such as Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky, Richard Thaler, and Paul Slovic. These errors in reasoning lead <b>most</b> <b>investors</b> to avoid value stocks and buy growth stocks at expensive prices, which allow those who reason correctly to profit from bargains in neglected value stocks and the overreacted selling of growth stocks. Investors prefer riskier funds in spring and safer funds in autumn.|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, JPMorgan {{developed}} a proprietary product called BISTRO (Broad Index Securitized Trust Offering) that [...] used CDS {{to clean up}} a bank’s balance sheet.

2500|$|Unfortunately, as {{with the}} Comstock mining {{securities}} boom of the 1870s, Los Angeles' land boom attracted an unscrupulous element that often sold interest in properties whose titles were not properly recorded, or in tracts that did not even exist. Major advertising campaigns by the SP, Santa Fe, Union Pacific, and other major carriers of the day not only helped transform southern California into a major tourist attraction but generated intense interest in exploiting the area's agricultural potential.

2500|$|The most {{significant}} reform regarding land use after Meles took power was {{the dissolution of}} the collective farms and redistribution of land at local levels. The demand for land ownership, expressed in the slogan [...] "Land to the tiller," [...] was central in toppling the feudal monarchy. The demand, however, was not fully answered. The new constitution, in Article 40, section 3, states that, [...] "The right to own rural and urban land as well as natural resources belongs only to the state and the people". The farmers have land use rights, but uncertain transfer rights. Starting in 2008, this land policy was set back after the government announced that it would begin leasing large areas of [...] "empty" [...] farm lands to foreign investors. Derided internationally as [...] "land grabs," [...] these operations threaten some smallholders with the loss of their plots. Reporting on this issue, the New York Times, quoting an expert, wrote, [...] "One thing that is very clear, that seems to have escaped the attention of <b>most</b> <b>investors,</b> is that this is not simply empty land" ...|$|E
