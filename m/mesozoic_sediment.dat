50|$|The oldest {{rocks in}} Mississippi {{date back to}} the Late Devonian. At the time, the northeastern part of the state was covered in seawater. Some areas of this sea were quite deep and had very low levels of {{dissolved}} oxygen. Brachiopods, crinoids, molluscs, and trilobites lived there. Remains of contemporary local plants also ended up preserved in this environment. However, the sea withdrew from the state during the Late Carboniferous. A lush coastal plain habitat took its place. This plain was forested by early trees and plants that resembled ferns. However, {{for the remainder of the}} Paleozoic, local sediments were eroding rather than being deposited. This erosive spell continued into the <b>Mesozoic.</b> <b>Sediment</b> deposition did not resume until Pangaea began to break up. The shallow sea that formed in Mississippi at that time was home to a rich fauna of both invertebrates and vertebrates. Cretaceous marine invertebrate life of Mississippi included cephalopods, coccolithophores, coelenterates, gastropods, the tube-shaped trace fossils Halymenites major, oysters, and scaphopods. Local vertebrates included the Late Cretaceous mosasaur Platecarpus tympaniticus. Sharks also left behind many teeth to fossilize. Cretaceous plant life left behind few fossils in Mississippi. Wood from local trees was preserved through petrifaction. Amber was preserved in Tishomingo County. The amber is especially common at a location roughly 1.6 miles east of Iuka. Specimens vary significantly in size from small bits to chunks the size of marbles. Some of the amber specimens contain bits of leaf inside them, but these inclusions are uncommon and often poorly preserved. Fossil leaves of this age were preserved in the area northeast of Fulton. Both of Mississippi's pre-Mesozoic and Cretaceous deposits formed in what is now the southern region of the state, in a physiographic province called the Gulf Coastal Plain. Dinosaurs like duck-bills and ostrich dinosaurs were preserved in the state. An extremely rare Maastrichian ceratopsian tooth was found in 2016, making it the third ceratopsian remain known from Appalachia.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: The central Peru forearc (6 °- 14 °S) is {{characterized}} by a variety of structural and tectonic styles.

Structural and stratigraphic relationships suggest several pulses of uplift and subsidence for the massif with the most recent uplift detected on the positive massif eatures. Upper slope basins are cradled between the OSH and a seaward Upper Slope Ridge (USR) of deformed sediment. Late Eocene and younger clastic sediments, with minor limestone beds, occupy the eastern Trujillo Basin, whereas late Miocene to Pleistocene dolomicrite, micrite and glauconitic micrite are prominent {{in the western part of}} the basin. Both the Trujillo and Yaquina Basins (7 °- 9 ° 30 'S) exhibit severe internal disruption caused by compressional stresses.

40|$|On the {{research}} cruise ARK-XXVIII/ 4 with the RV Polarstern from the 5 th of August to the 8 th of October 2014 an extraordinary see ice free area was detected over the Lomonosov Ridge south of 85 °N what granted {{a very successful}} aquisition of multichannel seismic reection data of 3084 km in length. Two aims of collecting these data, among others, were to provide an appropriate database for an IODP drilling proposal, and to enhance knowledge of sedimentary and tectonic processes in the area. In this thesis, {{the southern part of}} the collected seismic dataset is processed and interpreted. The seismic multichannel data were acquired with a 3000 m long streamer and an airgun cluster of 4 G-Guns. The dataset consists of two seismic profiles across the Lomonosov Ridge and its adjacent basins and a detailed network of profiles around the proposed drilling sites, LR- 1 A and LR- 2 A. The seismic data were processed with an emphasis on velocity analysis of those drilling sites and the suppression of multiple reflections. The seismic sections are dominated by an High-Amplitude Reflector Sequence (HARS) that persists across the entire profiles and that separates the flat-lying well-stratified upper unit of Cenozoic age from the lower <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>sediment</b> sequences. The top of the reflector sequence, probably represents the transition from an isolated stagnant shallow-water environment to a deep ocean with active hydrodynamics and correlates to the opening of the Fram Strait. Thus, it shows an age of latest Oligocene/Early Miocene. The base of the unconformity marks the break-up of the Lomonosov Ridge from the Siberian/Barents shelves between 58 - 56 Ma. A ray tracing program was applied on the seismic reection data of the two drilling sites where a drop of interval velocity in the HARS was detected. Thus, one of the main achievements of this thesis is the calculated decrease of drilling depth at LR- 1 A and LR- 2 A which allows to reconsider the main goals of the next Arctic Coring Expedition (ACEX). Furthermore, an approximate stratigraphic age model for the sedimentary layers overlying the Lomonosov Ridge, the Makarov Basin, and the Amundsen Basin was realized...|$|E

40|$|Fission-Track (FT) {{analysis}} of the Palaeozoic crystalline bedrock {{in the area of}} the southern Upper Rhine Graben (URG) showed complex and rapid changing upper crustal thermal conditions during the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic (Timar-Geng et al. 2004, 2006 a). While an Eo-Oligocene thermal pulse accompanying the rifting of the URG is well documented by apatite FT modelling results (Timar-Geng et al. 2006 a,b), the Jurassic hydrothermal period leading to a broad scatter of zircon FT data (Timar-Geng et al. 2004) are only weakly constrained. Additionally, due to a large sedimentary hiatus between the Upper Jurassic and the Late Eocene the pre-rift evolution remains still unclear. Knowledge about the thermal evolution of the area is essential for development of crustal scale models, which evaluate the rift-evolution. This study aims to clarify the timing of the Jurassic thermal pulse(s) and its potential to heat the Mesozoic sediments, which covers the Palaeozoic basement. Especially, the temperatures and geothermal-gradients that were reached are of mayor interest. During a hydrothermal period is convective heat transport the important mechanism, which influences the reached temperatures in the upper crust. Therefore, addresses a localised detail study at the URG main border fault the potential of fault-bounded thermal anomalies caused by ascending hot fluids to heat the surrounding rocks. The FT method, which is the base method used here, is a low-temperature thermochronological method widely used to quantify the thermal history of igneous, metamorphic and clastic sedimentary rocks. In particular, the FT analyses of detrital samples provide the advantage to discriminate between a pre-depositional thermal history of the provenance regions and a post-depositional basin related thermal history (e. g. Brandon 1998, Carter 1999, Bernet & Garver 2005, Armstrong 2005). The FT analyses oft the Permian and <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>sediment</b> column in the URG area, this study, compared with previous FT studies from the Black Forest and the Vosges (Michalski 1988, Wyss 2000, Timar-Geng et al. 2004, 2006 a, b) led to a complete overview of the FT age signatures of URG pre-rift units. This is a requirement for the interpretation of Cenozoic detrital syn-rift deposits of the region by the FT method. New FT analyses on Cenozoic samples from the southern URG area led to basal insights in the syn-rift river drainage patterns. ...|$|E
40|$|During the RV Polarstern cruise ARK-XXIII- 3 {{in summer}} of 2008, {{geophysical}} data of a nearly 1200 km long seismic transect along 81 ° N including the Amundsen Basin, Lomonosov Ridge, Makarov Basin, Mendeleev Ridge and Canada Basin could be acquired. The {{objective was to}} understand the tectonic evolution of the Makarov Basin in relation to the evolution of the adjacent Lomonosov and Mendeleev ridges in the Amerasia Basin. The data acquisition involved seismic reflection and refraction data, gravity, bathymetry, and magnetics. The seismic survey set-up included a 300 m streamer and a 32 liter airgun cluster. Because of ice conditions, gaps remained between the profiles {{but for the first time}} it was possible to get a nearly complete overview over the three main features within the Arctic Ocean. In addition to reflection seismic data, eight sonobuoys were deployed along the profiles to better resolve the seismic velocities in the sedimentary column. The seismic sections are dominated by an unconformity that persists across the entire transect and that separates the flat-lying well-stratified upper unit of Cenozoic age from the lower <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>sediment</b> sequences, which are dominated by pervasive normal faulting. The unconformity marks the break-up of the Lomonosov Ridge from the Siberian/Barents shelves between 56 - 65 Ma ago. The developed velocity depth functions indicate sediment thicknesses from 1200 - 2000 m on the Lomonosov Ridge to 5500 - 6300 m within the deepest point of the Makarov Basin around 168 ° E, to 1000 - 1500 m on the western flank of the Mendeleev Ridge, to ~ 4000 m within the Canada Basin. The continental origin of the Lomonosov Ridge could be approved. The fact that evidences for oceanic origin are missing leads to the assumption that the Makarov Basin is created only by extension of continental crust between the opening of the Canada Basin and the initiation of the Eurasia Basin, 120 - 56 Ma ago. However, the possibility of a partly oceanic crust can not be ruled out. The high velocities of the basement (> 6. 4 km/s), the density characteristics and the uniform crust within the 2 D gravity modeling leads to the conclusion that the Mendeleev ridge has an oceanic origin. The modeled thick crust (33 km) could be explained by the theory of a Large Igneous Province (LIP) around 89 Ma ago. All interpretations support the rotational models...|$|E
40|$|Structural mapping {{has shown}} the North-South Axis at the western margin of the Pelagian Platform, to be {{dominated}} by NE/SW to N/S-trending anticlines and macro and mesoscale thrusts. The major anticlines have geometries consistent with fault-bend, tip-line and “hybrid” tip-line/fault-line folds and are interpreted to be underlain by “blind” thrusts with predominantly “ramp-flat” geometries and with decollement in Triassic evaporites. Restoration of NW-SE-orientated balanced cross-sections constructed across the North-South Axis indicates that up to 40 Km of shortening occurred in the Middle Miocence. Post-Miocene structures include sinistral and dextral strike-slip faults, normal faults, thrusts and folds. The North-South Axis is re-interpreted as a thin-skinned thrust belt, which forms the thrust front to the Atlas Mountains. As a consequence of this new interpretation the Alpine thrust belt in Tunisia is at least 100 Km wider than proposed in previous models. The thrust front is oblique to the NE/SW-trending structures of the Atlas Mountains, which has generated a thrust belt with a northward taper. Spatial variations in the crustal rheology/thickness and/or thermal structure of the lithosphere, inherited from the Mesozoic Tethys passive margin in Tunisia, cannot explain this tapered geometry. Therefore, basement structures or related Mesozoic facies belts are believed to have controlled the orientation of the thrust front. Decompacted geohistory plots for wells in the Sahel E of the North-South Axis, show an increase in deposition rates synchronous with formation of the thrust front structures. This is interpreted as foreland basin subsidence. The Eocene to Lower Miocene sediments and Palaeofacies maps for central Tunisia are also consistent with a foreland basin/flexural bulge model suggesting that thrusting began as early as the Eocene in northern Tunisia. The influence of Mesozoic Tethys passive margin structure on the geometry of the North-South Axis thrust belt is examined. Geohistory plots of wells from the Sahel and North-South Axis indicate variable Jurassic-Early Cretaceous sediment thickness. On interpreted seismic sections, these are shown to result from differential subsidence across NW/SE-trending oblique-slip or extensional faults and N/S-trending faults in the North-South Axis, situated above basement fractures. Late Cretaceous subsidence was generally slow and of probable thermal origin. However, Late Cretaceous strike-slip reactivation of the NW/SE-trending basement structures allowed the accumulation of thicker sediments in small strike-slip basins. The orientation of Mesozoic faults and Facies belts in central Tunisia indicate a NW/SE passive margin but with N/S-trending elements. In the North-South Axis, Middle Miocene lateral thrust structures are spatially related to <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>sediment</b> thickness variation, so that lateral thrust ramps are situates above NW/SE-trending Tethys basin margin faults. Similarly, the N/S trend of the thrust front might be controlled by N/S faults below the North-South Axis. Post-Miocene structures in the North-South Axis are consistent with sinistral wrenching on an underlying N/S basement fault. This suggest that basement fault reactivation controlled cover deformation after Middle Miocene thrusting. Sinistral wrenching in the postulated North-South Axis basement fault is consistent with a second order structure to the Medina wrench transform plate boundary to the NE...|$|E

40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. The Gawler Craton, South Australia hosts the Olympic Dam Iron Oxide Copper Gold deposit {{as well as}} a number of other IOCG, copper, gold, and iron ore deposits. In the Stuart Shelf region (eastern Gawler Craton), primary mineralisation is generally hosted within basement granites and volcanics of the Hiltaba Suite. Basement rock, potentially containing mineralisation, on the Stuart Shelf is often overlain and concealed by Adelaidean sequences as well as highly weathered, altered and complex Mesozoic cover sequences. These sedimentary basin sediments can conceal mineralisation and are a major frontier for mineral explorers to overcome. Identification of key physical, chemical and biological interfaces, such as basal gravels, redox zones and palaeosols, within the cover sequences and understanding the processes which have led to their formation can be a useful tool in exploration. Andamooka, South Australia, lies on the Stuart Shelf near the southern margin of the Eromanga Basin. Exposed <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>sediments</b> of the Eromanga basin at Andamooka are in close proximity to the Olympic Dam IOCG deposit and are therefore important in understanding dispersion patterns within the cover sequences of elements and minerals associated with IOCG type mineral systems. This understanding can be used for further exploration in the area, where mineralisation may be concealed by <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>sediments.</b> The purpose of this paper is to describe the <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>sediments</b> around Andamooka, identifying any key interfaces and to devise a geochemical footprint of the <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>sediments</b> in this area, which can be used to aid exploration.
