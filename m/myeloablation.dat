25|$|Bone marrow {{transplantation}} {{usually requires}} that the recipient's own bone marrow be destroyed (<b>myeloablation).</b> Prior to the administration of new cells (engraftment) patients may go for several weeks without appreciable numbers of white blood cells to help fight infection. This puts a patient {{at high risk of}} infections, sepsis and septic shock, despite prophylactic antibiotics. However, antiviral medications, such as acyclovir and valacyclovir, are quite effective in prevention of HSCT-related outbreak of herpetic infection in seropositive patients. The immunosuppressive agents employed in allogeneic transplants for the prevention or treatment of graft-versus-host disease further increase the risk of opportunistic infection. Immunosuppressive drugs are given for a minimum of 6-months after a transplantation, or much longer if required for the treatment of graft-versus-host disease. Transplant patients lose their acquired immunity, for example immunity to childhood diseases such as measles or polio. For this reason transplant patients must be re-vaccinated with childhood vaccines once they are off immunosuppressive medications.|$|E

In this study we examined the use of donor C 57 BL/ 6 (H- 2 b) immature dendritic cells (imDCs) to tolerize the BALB/c (H- 2 d) recipient to bone marrow transplantation (BMT), allowing the induction of mixed chimerism without immunosuppression or <b>myeloablation.</b> We showed that successful mismatched bone marrow engraftment can be achieved using imDCs given up to 3 days prior to BMT and that mixed chimerism can be established and detected in excess of 100 days post-BMT without evidence of graft-versus-host disease. Furthermore, we showed that imDCs can suppress lymphocyte proliferation in response to mismatched MHC stimulation, leading to increased expression of interleukin (IL) - 4 and IL- 10 and decreased expression of IL- 2 and interferon-γ (IFN-γ). The induction of stable chimeras through pre-conditioning of mice with donor imDCs followed by BMT led to tolerance, allowing the long-term survival (> 110 days) of mismatched cardiac allografts and the prolonged survival of mismatched skin allografts without the need for immunosuppression or <b>myeloablation.</b> Transplantation with third-party C 3 H allografts were rapidly rejected in this model, suggesting that immune-specific tolerance was achieved.

Total body irradiation (TBI) is a classical <b>myeloablation</b> regimen {{used to improve}} engraftment levels of human cells in these humanized mice. Some recent reports suggest the use of busulfan as a <b>myeloablation</b> regimen to transplant HPCs in neonatal and adult NSG mice.

As pretreatment, dimethyl myleran (DMM), an alkylating agent that produces effective <b>myeloablation</b> but little immunosuppression, was used with total body irradiation (TBI). Four conditioning regimens were studied: TBI 800 rads (1 rad = 0. 01 Gy), TBI 950 rads, TBI 800 rads plus DMM (0. 2 mg per mouse), and TBI 950 rads plus DMM. Survival rates, chimerism, proliferative responses in mixed-lymphocyte culture, specific cell-mediated lympholysis, and in vivo plaque-forming cell responses to several antigens were compared.

40|$|Almost 5 {{decades after}} the first {{clinical}} transplantations, delayed immune reconstitution remains a considerable hurdle in bone marrow transplantation, and the mechanisms regulating immune reconstitution after transplantation remain to be established. Whereas adult fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand-deficient (FL-/-) mice have reduced numbers of early Band T-cell progenitors, they sustain close to normal levels of mature B and T cells. Herein, we demonstrate that adult bone marrow cells fail to reconstitute B-cell progenitors and conventional B cells in lethally irradiated FL-/- recipients, which also display delayed kinetics of T-cell reconstitution. Similarly, FL is essential for B-cell regeneration after chemotherapy-induced <b>myeloablation.</b> In contrast, fetal progenitors reconstitute B lymphopoiesis in FL-/- mice, albeit at reduced levels. A critical role of FL in adult B lymphopoiesis is further substantiated by an age-progressive decline in peripheral conventional B cells in FL-/- mice, whereas fetally and early postnatally derived B 1 and marginal zone B cells are sustained in a FL-independent manner. Thus, FL {{plays a crucial role}} in sustaining conventional B lymphopoiesis in adult mice and, as a consequence, our findings implicate a critical role of FL in promoting immune reconstitution after <b>myeloablation</b> and bone marrow transplantation...|$|E

In mice, BAFF {{has been shown to}} be essential for B cell recovery after <b>myeloablation.</b> To assess how BAFF levels relate to transplantation factors and subsequent development of cGVHD, we prospectively monitored 412 patients in the first year after allogeneic peripheral blood or bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and censored data at time of cGVHD onset. In patients who did not develop cGVHD, we affirmed a temporal pattern of gradually decreasing BAFF levels as B cell numbers increase after myeloablative conditioning. In contrast, after reduced-intensity conditioning, BAFF levels remained high throughout the first post-HSCT year, suggesting that the degree of <b>myeloablation</b> resulted in delayed B cell recovery associated with persistence of higher BAFF levels. Given that high BAFF/B cell ratios have been associated with active cGVHD, we examined differences in early BAFF/B cell ratios and found significantly different BAFF/B cell ratios at 3 months post-HSCT only after myeloablative conditioning in patients who subsequently developed cGVHD. In addition to HSCT conditioning type, the use of sirolimus was significantly associated with higher BAFF levels after HSCT, and this also was potentially related to lower B cell numbers.

OBJECTIVES: (1) To test the ability of low-intensity <b>myeloablation</b> mediated T(reg) activation to prevent and/or to treat experimental arthritis using the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model and (2) to clarify the role of T(reg) in mediating the beneficial effect. METHODS: Low-dose irradiation was used before the induction of arthritis or at the onset of disease. The role of T(regs) (CD 4 CD 25 forkhead box P 3 (FoxP 3) (+) cells) and their suppressive activity was assessed by testing their functional activities ex vivo after the treatment and by their in vivo depletion before the treatment. RESULTS: It was observed that irradiation ameliorated CIA before or after disease induction. T(regs) appear to play a fundamental role in the therapeutic efficacy of irradiation, because the depletion of CD 25 or folate receptor (FR) 4 (+) cells with specific antibodies before the treatment abolished the beneficial effects. The therapeutic efficacy was associated with an increment in the proportion of T(regs) despite the overall reduction in lymphocyte counts.

Nrf 2 activation initially protects HSCs from the detrimental effects of ROS, but protection is transient, and increased ROS levels return, promoting a long-term decrease in HSC self-renewal. In vivo, LD total body irradiation (TBI) does not decrease HSC numbers unless the HSC microenvironment is altered by an inflammatory insult.

Conditional deletion of Jagged- 1 in endothelial cells (Jag 1 (ECKO) mice) results in a profound decrease in hematopoiesis and premature exhaustion of the adult HSC pool, whereas quantification and functional assays demonstrate that loss of Jagged- 1 does not perturb vascular or mesenchymal compartments.

40|$|IntroductionTargeting {{of cancer}} by {{chemotherapy}} {{in combination with}} anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy has demonstrated not only the clinical efficacy but also {{a higher risk of}} serious hematologic complications including neutropenia. The {{purpose of the study was}} to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of neutropenia during the combination treatment. MethodsMouse model and in vitro studies were undertaken to determine the effect of interference with VEGF signaling by VEGF-specific agents or a multitargeted VEGF receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor on proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) and repopulation of the hematopoietic compartment after <b>myeloablation.</b> ResultsThe studies demonstrated that blockage of VEGFR 1 or VEGFR 2 signaling decreased HPC proliferation and impaired repopulation of the hematopoietic compartment after myelosuppression by slowing the progression of HPC through the cell cycle. The combination of cytotoxic drugs and VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor had an additive inhibitory effect and decreased proliferation of HPC significantly stronger than either agent alone. ConclusionsSignaling through both VEGFR 1 and VEGFR 2 is required for normal reconstitution of the hematopoietic compartment after cytotoxic chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|Invasive {{fungal infections}} are a {{leading cause of}} {{morbidity}} and mortality after myelotoxic chemotherapy or radiation exposure. The resulting depletion of myeloid precursors under these conditions appears to be the factor that limits approaches to accelerate immune reconstitution. In a murine model of <b>myeloablation</b> after radiation exposure, we demonstrated that highly purified common myeloid and granulocyte-monocyte pro-genitors (CMPs/GMPs) accelerated myeloid recovery and, thus, enhanced innate immunity as measured by survival after a lethal challenge with Aspergillus fumigatus. Of greatest significance was the demonstration that the protection afforded by CMPs/GMPs was not major histocompatibility complex restricted. Furthermore, the effect of CMP/GMP cellular therapy was additive with that of liposomal amphotericin B treatment. These observations greatly expand the potential donor pool and, thus, the clinical utility of CMP/GMP cellular therapy in patients with myeloid depletion. Myeloid depletion results in significant susceptibility to bacterial and fungal infections, regardless of whether the depletion occurred as sequelae of therapies for ma-lignancies, exposure to other forms of radiation, or genetic deficiencies. In the case of a myelotoxic insult...|$|E
40|$|Innate {{lymphoid cells}} (ILCs) have potent {{immunological}} functions in experimental conditions in mice, but {{their contributions to}} immunity in natural conditions in humans have remained unclear. We investigated the presence of ILCs in a cohort of patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). All ILC subsets were absent in patients with SCID who had mutation of the gene encoding the common γ-chain cytokine receptor subunit IL- 2 Rγ or the gene encoding the tyrosine kinase JAK 3. T cell reconstitution was observed in patients with SCID after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), but the patients still had considerably fewer ILCs {{in the absence of}} <b>myeloablation</b> than did healthy control subjects, with the exception of rare cases of reconstitution of the ILC 1 subset of ILCs. Notably, the ILC deficiencies observed were not associated with any particular susceptibility to disease, with follow-up extending from 7 years to 39 years after HSCT. We thus report here selective ILC deficiency in humans and show that ILCs might be dispensable in natural conditions, if T cells are present and B cell function is preserve...|$|E
40|$|Patients {{with severe}} {{sickle cell disease}} (SCD) are {{candidates}} for gene therapy using autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), but concomitant multi-organ disease may contraindicate pretransplant conditioning with full <b>myeloablation.</b> We tested whether nonmyeloablative conditioning, a regimen used successfully for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation of adult SCD patients, allows engraftment of Î³-globin gene-corrected cells to a therapeutic level in the Berkeley mouse model of SCD. Animals transplanted according to this regimen averaged 35 % engraftment of transduced hematopoietic stem cells with an average vector copy < 2. 0. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels ranged from 20 to 44 % of total hemoglobin and approximately two-thirds of circulating red blood cells expressed HbF detected by immunofluorescence (F-cells). Gene therapy treatment of SCD mice ameliorated anemia, reduced hyperleukocytosis, improved renal function, and reduced iron accumulation in liver, spleen, and kidneys. Thus, modest levels of chimerism with donor cells expressing high levels of HbF from an insulated Î³-globin lentiviral vector can improve the pathology of SCD in mice, thereby illustrating a potentially safe and effective strategy for gene therapy in humans...|$|E
40|$|Bone marrow {{transplantation}} (BMT) is {{the treatment}} of choice for many leukemias, solid tumors, and metabolic diseases. The field of bone marrow research is highly dependent on in vivo experimentation, because in vitro techniques do not mimic these complicated in vivo systems. Therefore, understanding the medical and husbandry care needs of these transiently immunodeficient bone marrow recipient animals is crucial for researchers, veterinary and animal care personnel. Here we discuss the principles of bone marrow transplantation, mouse pathogens that can interfere with transplantation research, and important husbandry and veterinary practices for mice that may help to minimize unnecessary infections during the transplantation process. Whole-body irradiation {{is one of the}} most common tools for <b>myeloablation</b> of the recipient's bone marrow. We discuss the crucial role of the irradiator for BMT research and the importance of aseptic husbandry practices to lessen the possibility of the irradiator for being a source for disease transmission. Finally, we discuss some important guidelines for Institutional Animal Use and Care Committees reviewing irradiation and BMT protocols...|$|E
