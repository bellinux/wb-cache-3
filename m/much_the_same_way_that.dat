5|$|Little was not {{the first}} to gain and lose his fortune in the stock market, but he was a {{pioneering}} speculator, the first to rely on his ability to predict market fluctuations to inform his speculations instead of bidding with what would today be considered insider information. He was the first Great Bear; before his rapid rise speculation and market manipulation was virtually unknown in the stock market, as no one before him had had the still nerve and financial foresight necessary to profit from such risky endeavors, and many market historians consider him the first modern stock market tycoon. His ability to gain and lose fortunes on a day-by-day basis was a microcosm of the meteoric possibilities and insecurities of speculation, and after his death and even during his life many other investors tried to imitate his success, with little success. His victory over the Erie Railroad scheme (and market cornering activities in general) inspired similar plots in the years thereafter; in 1863 the industrialist Cornelius Vanderbilt successfully cornered the Harlem Railroad in <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> Little had done almost thirty years earlier, and fell into a corner trap formed by Daniel Drew and others himself in the later Erie War. This did much to give credence to convertible bonds, then still a novelty.|$|E

25|$|A {{parabolic}} microphone uses a {{parabolic reflector}} {{to collect and}} focus sound waves onto a microphone receiver, in <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> a parabolic antenna (e.g. satellite dish) does with radio waves. Typical uses of this microphone, which has unusually focused front sensitivity and can pick up sounds from many meters away, include nature recording, outdoor sporting events, eavesdropping, law enforcement, and even espionage. Parabolic microphones are not typically used for standard recording applications, {{because they tend to}} have poor low-frequency response as a side effect of their design.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} to suggest that Howland Island was the site of prehistoric settlement, which possibly extended down to Rawaki, Kanton, Manra and Orona, probably {{in the form of a}} single community utilising several adjacent islands. Archaeological sites have been discovered on Manra and Orona, which suggest two distinct groups of settlers, one from eastern Polynesia, and one from Micronesia. The hard life on these isolated islands undoubtedly led to extinction of or dereliction by the settled peoples, in <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> other islands in the area (such as Christmas Island and Pitcairn) were abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Some {{producers}} {{will still}} use non-oak barrels, such as chestnut, juniper and cherry wood {{and may even}} blend batches of Vin Santo aged in different wood barrels together.

As a fall back, if their wines become too oxidised or do not develop the way the producer wishes, some Vin Santo may be intentionally converted into vinegar that is very desirable in the culinary market.|$|E

The Pania statue on Marine Parade is regarded in Napier in <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> the Little Mermaid statue is regarded in Copenhagen. In October 2005 the statue was stolen, but it was recovered a week later, largely unharmed. Marineland was a tourist attraction from 1965 until it closed in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Although at {{the time}} of Millikan's oil-drop {{experiments}} it was becoming clear that there exist such things as subatomic particles, not everyone was convinced. Experimenting with cathode rays in 1897, J. J. Thomson had discovered negatively charged 'corpuscles', as he called them, with a charge-to-mass ratio 1840 times that of a hydrogen ion. Similar results had been found by George FitzGerald and Walter Kaufmann. Most of what was then known about electricity and magnetism, however, could be explained on the basis that charge is a continuous variable; in <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> many of the properties of light can be explained by treating it as a continuous wave rather than as a stream of photons.|$|E
25|$|Embryo {{transfer}} techniques allow {{top quality}} female livestock {{to have a}} greater influence on the genetic advancement of a herd or flock in <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> artificial insemination has allowed greater use of superior sires. ET also allows the continued use of animals such as competition mares to continue training and showing, while producing foals. The general epidemiological aspects of embryo transfer indicates that the transfer of embryos provides the opportunity to introduce genetic material into populations of livestock while greatly reducing the risk for transmission of infectious diseases. Recent developments in the sexing of embryos before transfer and implanting has great potential in the dairy and other livestock industries.|$|E

25|$|In {{the middle}} of the nineteenth century, the game of {{baseball}} began to evolve from a sport played by amateurs for recreation into a more serious game played by professionals. One of the most dramatic changes was the transition of the pitcher's delivery from an underhand motion to an overhanded throw. Before the American Civil War, the pitcher's role was to initiate the action by offering an underhanded throw to the batter, in <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> a basketball referee offers up a jump ball to begin play. Since this type of pitching often caused the batter to hit lazy, foul pop-ups, catchers played their position approximately twenty to twenty-five feet behind the batter, and wore no protective equipment.|$|E
25|$|Foursquare gained {{popularity}} as {{it allowed}} for users to check into places {{that they are}} frequenting at that moment.

Clixtr, though in the real-time space, is also a location-based social networking site, since events created by users are automatically geotagged, and users can view events occurring nearby through the Clixtr iPhone app. Recently, Yelp announced its entrance into the location-based social networking space through check-ins with their mobile app; {{whether or not this}} becomes detrimental to Foursquare or Gowalla is yet to be seen, as it is still considered a new space in the Internet technology industry.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary psychologists {{say that}} natural {{selection}} has provided humans with many psychological adaptations, in <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> it generated humans' anatomical and physiological adaptations. As with adaptations in general, psychological adaptations {{are said to}} be specialized for the environment in which an organism evolved, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness. Sexual selection provides organisms with adaptations related to mating. For male mammals, which have a relatively high maximal potential reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to adaptations that help them compete for females. For female mammals, with a relatively low maximal potential reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to choosiness, which helps females select higher quality mates. Charles Darwin described both natural selection and sexual selection, and he relied on group selection to explain the evolution of altruistic (self-sacrificing) behavior. But group selection was considered a weak explanation, because in any group the less altruistic individuals {{will be more likely to}} survive, and the group will become less self-sacrificing as a whole.|$|E

25|$|The {{renewal of}} {{learning}} in Europe, that began with 12th century Scholasticism, {{came to an end}} about the time of the Black Death, and the initial period of the subsequent Italian Renaissance is sometimes seen as a lull in scientific activity. The Northern Renaissance, on the other hand, showed a decisive shift in focus from Aristoteleian natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine). Thus modern science in Europe was resumed in a period of great upheaval: the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-Reformation; the discovery of the Americas by Christopher Columbus; the Fall of Constantinople; but also the re-discovery of Aristotle during the Scholastic period presaged large social and political changes. Thus, a suitable environment was created in which it became possible to question scientific doctrine, in <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> Martin Luther and John Calvin questioned religious doctrine. The works of Ptolemy (astronomy) and Galen (medicine) were found not always to match everyday observations. Work by Vesalius on human cadavers found problems with the Galenic view of anatomy.|$|E
