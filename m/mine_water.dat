5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, Eddy Creek lacked culm {{deposits}} at its mouth. However, its water was colored yellow by sulfur at that location. Further upstream, two pipes discharged <b>mine</b> <b>water</b> into the creek. One of these pipes had reddish water. However, upstream of an ash dump on the creek, {{the water was}} clear.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} pumping {{water from the}} mines {{introduces}} oxygen via aeration, thereby oxidising the rock's pyrite. Pyrite contains sulfur, and one consequence of its oxidation is the introduction of significant amounts of sulphates into <b>mine</b> <b>water.</b> This has had {{a negative impact on}} water quality in five lakes in the Kurtna Lake District. In some lakes, sulphate levels have increased tens of times compared to the pre-mining period. Suspended mineral matter in the <b>mine</b> <b>water</b> pumped into these lakes has changed the composition of the lakes' sediments. However, it has been found that this disturbance diminishes over time; studies show that sulphates and iron in mining water decrease to levels that meet drinking water quality standards about five years after mine closure.|$|E

40|$|In {{the course}} of the {{development}} and exploitation of particular uranium deposits, the chemism of <b>mine</b> <b>waters</b> changes depending upon the extent of infiltration area, the total volume of worked-out mineral, its mineralogical composition and also the achieved depth of mining.

40|$|The paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} the research project Non-traditional Utilization of Uranium Deposits after Underground Mining Completion ” which has dealt with problems of the utilization of <b>mine</b> <b>waters</b> of abandoned and flooded uranium mines as a secondary source of uranium. After flooding the deposit, the intensive dissolution of uranium minerals takes place and uranium concentration in the waters increases markedly. Simultaneously, the vertical stratification of <b>mine</b> <b>waters</b> occurs; in deeper horizons of the former mine, uranium concentrations are conspicuously higher that in the subsurface parts of the mine. Potential utilization of these <b>mine</b> <b>waters</b> as a secondary uranium source is, to a certain extent, analogous to the “in situ leaching ” method of mining. Nevertheless, the process of transferring uranium into solution is not intensified by introducing acids into the rock environment, but instead the natural processes of dissolving uranium minerals in <b>mine</b> <b>waters</b> after their preceding oxidation in the stage of deposit exploitation are used. The project has dealt with possibilities of intensive utilization of <b>mine</b> <b>waters</b> with high uranium concentrations as secondary source of the raw material with the accompanying effect of shortening the time necessary for the treatment of <b>mine</b> <b>waters</b> drained.

40|$|AbstractThe River Lippe is {{situated}} at {{the northern part of}} the rhenish-westphalian coal mining area, Germany and has a long history of being affected by <b>mining</b> <b>water</b> discharge. There has, however, been a massive decrease in the discharge of <b>mining</b> <b>water</b> over the past few decades. While early in the last century concentrations of up to 3500 mgl− 1 of chloride were observed, the mean concentration is now below 400 mgl− 1.

Macroinvertebrate data collected from three sites along the River Lippe was analyzed for a change in the occurrence of salt tolerant species in an area where <b>mining</b> <b>water</b> discharge ended in 2000.

The changes of concentrations of barium and iron ions, sulphates, chlorides were analysed. Barium was removed from waters by precipitation of sulphates.

40|$|In the Czech Republic are <b>mine</b> <b>waters</b> {{well defined}} by Directives No. 254 / 2001 and No. 44 / 1988. Pumped <b>mine</b> <b>waters</b> from strip or {{underground}} mines {{are affected by}} increased volumes of iron cations, manganese cations, sulphates anions, acid carbonates and by acid pH.

The concentration of characterised pollution of <b>mine</b> <b>waters</b> does not allow direct discharge of these waters into the surface waters, not even their utilization without previous modification or treatment. <b>Mine</b> <b>waters</b> treatment technology on particular localities could be characterised as mechanical–chemical processes, including processes of solid matter sedimentation and further neutralization. This procedure ensures quality of treated waters for its discharge into the surface waters almost in all limited parameters of pollution.

Mixing between local groundwaters and acid <b>mine</b> <b>waters</b> plays a minor role, if any. ous solution (pH < 3. 5; Nordstrom, 1982 a). In the latter case, pyrite oxidation is prevailingly driven by Fe 3 + (Singer and Stumm, 1970; Moses et al., 1987). Unfortunately, at these low pH values, an Fe-oxidizing bacterium, Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, speeds up the O 2 -driven oxidation of Fe 2 + to Fe 3 + by a factor greater than 106 (Singer and Stumm, 1970). Under these conditions the overall process, i. e., Fe 3 + reduction to Fe 2 + by pyrite plus oxidation of Fe 2 + to Fe 3 + by atmos-pheric O 2, is very fast. In mine wastes, where py-rite has generally become fine-grained due to crushing, acid production is particularly effective, especially above the water table, where oxidation rates are enhanced by bacterial catalysis (Langmuir, 1997). Acid waters usually acquire high concentrations of metals through interaction with metal-rich mine wastes (e. g., Appelo and Postma, 1996).
