40|$|Making {{contracts}} between {{farmers and}} firms (contract farming, for short) {{plays an important}} role in establishing access to the agricultural markets for the small producers, especially in the developing and less developed countries. It is argued that contract farming provides farmers with the assured sale of their crops and agro-business firms with a steady supply of agricultural products required by the market. This paper focuses on analyzing benefits of tea producers through signing contract with firms. By using relevant research methods of verifying studying areas, making Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), and surveying farmers, the paper finds that although contract farmers receive lower fresh tea price in compared with the price received by non-contract farmers, they would have higher price stability and are provided with <b>market</b> <b>guarantee</b> mechanism. These benefits are really important in context of globalization and market liberalization with the demand for high quality and high value products. It is highly recommended that small farmers therefore should participate in the coordination model between farmers and firms in the process of tea production and marketing in Phu Tho Province, Vietnam.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the risks implied by a mixed system of Social Security pension benefits with {{different combinations of}} pay-as-you-go taxes and personal retirement account (PRA) saving. The analysis shows how these risks can be reduced by using alternative private <b>market</b> <b>guarantee</b> strategies. The first such strategy uses a blend of equities and TIPS to guarantee at least a positive real rate or return on each year's PRA saving. The second is an explicit zero-cost collar that guarantees {{an annual rate of}} return by giving up all returns above a certain level. One variant of these guarantees uses a two stage procedure: a guaranteed return to age 66 and then a separate guarantee on the implicit return in the annuity phase. An alternative strategy provides a combined guarantee on the return during both the accumulation and the annuity phase. Simulations are presented of the probability distributions of retirement incomes relative to the "benchmark" benefits specified in current law. Calculations of expected utility show that these risk reduction techniques can raise expected utility relative to the plans with no guarantees. The ability to do so depends on the individual's risk aversion level. This underlines the idea that different individuals would rationally prefer different investment strategies and risk reduction options. ...|$|E

30|$|Specifically, {{from the}} {{national}} housing system perspective, a housing mechanism that meets both purchase and rental purposes and meets housing demand from new urban populations is vital and necessary. Governments should gradually explore a system whereby tenants enjoy {{the same rights as}} home buyers, deepen the reform of the housing rental <b>market,</b> <b>guarantee</b> tenants the same employment opportunities and benefits as registered permanent residents in the labor market, and guarantee renters’ rights and interests in basic public services such as school enrollment for their children, medical insurance, and so on. Secondly, from the social and economic integration perspective, local governments, especially governments in first-tier cities and eastern coastal cities, should be encouraged to reform the housing supply system with the market playing the leading role in catering to multilayered demand while the government takes care of basic housing demand. Governments should provide various forms of rental housing, such as public rental houses and low-rent houses for migrants who do not yet own their own houses. It is recommended that governments ensure that housing is provided for all people and that they help migrants, especially renters, improve their city integration level. Thirdly, from the cultural integration perspective, local governments should strengthen regulations of rental building common areas by setting up autonomous management organizations. For instance, communities can encourage migrants to actively participate in local elections and various forms of sports activities, improve their integration motivation and process, and help them realize self-development and self-value. Eventually, from the psychological integration perspective, given that mass population migration can stimulate the nation’s economy (Bove and Elia 2017), it is essential that people with permanent household registration eliminate discrimination and exclusion of migrants and enhance their mutual trust.|$|E

But the theoretical examination of information markets has lagged relative to their implementation and use. This paper proposes a simple theoretical model of information markets to understand their information dynamics. We investigate and provide initial answers to a series of research questions that are important to understanding how information markets work, which are: (1) Does an information market converge to a consensus equilibrium? (2) If yes, how fast is the convergence process? (3) What is the best possible equilibrium of an information market? and (4) Is an information <b>market</b> <b>guaranteed</b> to converge to the best possible equilibrium...|$|R

Through the contributions of the Austrian economists, that underlined the mutations that occur after the inflationary processes in the allocation of resources, revenue distribution and in the evolution of entrepreneurial activities, we understand the necessity to use a healthy currency.

Contracts provide growers with an assured <b>market,</b> <b>guaranteed</b> price, and assistance in proper growing practices. Processors and marketing agencies can better control quality and supply through contracts. The proportion of sunflower growers under contract has been declining as farmers become more familiar with the crop, because of expanding market outlets, and because several contractors wish to avoid costs of contracting. Sunflowers are contracted directly with contractors or through their agent country elevators. Contracts generally specify acreage, price, quality, delivery, and payment provisions.

40|$|Many {{variable}} annuities provide money-back <b>guarantees</b> and <b>market</b> <b>guarantees</b> on invested principal. Embedded in some {{of these}} guarantees are stochastic maturity put options with adjustable strike prices. These variable annuities can be surrendered or lapsed at any time. The lapse option when exercised rationally represents an American style sell-back option that is exercised by the policyholder when the embedded put option is out-of-the-money. The death benefits we consider are only exercised involuntary, that is, upon the death of the policyholder. Critical to the valuation analysis is that the embedded put options have stochastic maturity and that the policyholder can exercise the lapse, or early-exercise, option feature to increase the value of the contract and thereby exposing the insurance company to loss of fees. We analyze specific variable annuity products by focusing on the lapse option when exercised either rationally or irrationally, taking into account the mortality risk and surrender charges...|$|R
