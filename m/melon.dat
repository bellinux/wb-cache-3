5|$|The whale ear has {{specific}} {{adaptations to}} the marine environment. In humans, {{the middle ear}} works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a <b>melon.</b> This <b>melon</b> consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a <b>melon</b> will have a large depression. The <b>melon</b> size varies between species, the bigger the more dependent they are of it. A beaked whale for example has a small bulge {{sitting on top of}} its skull, whereas a sperm whale's head is filled up mainly with the <b>melon.</b>|$|E

Sulfur-containing esters and compounds containing a straight six-carbon chain were present at high concentrations in cantaloupe <b>melons.</b> Compounds containing a straight nine-carbon chain were at high concentrations in honeydew <b>melons.</b> Methyl esters were {{present at the}} highest levels in Galia <b>melons.</b> The sensory properties of the three <b>melons</b> were also compared. Cantaloupe <b>melons</b> were associated with sweet, floral and fruity aromas and a persistent aftertaste. Galia <b>melons</b> possessed the strongest cucumber-like flavours, while cucumber aroma and sweet flavour scored highly in honeydew <b>melons.</b> (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|The ears {{of river}} {{dolphins}} have specific adaptations to their aquatic environment. In humans, {{the middle ear}} works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In river dolphins, and other cetaceans, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, river dolphins receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allows for greater directional hearing underwater. Dolphins send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a <b>melon.</b> This <b>melon</b> consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a <b>melon</b> will have a large depression. This allows river dolphins to produce biosonar for orientation. They are so dependent on echolocation that they can survive {{even if they are}} blind. Beyond locating an object, echolocation also provides the animal with an idea on the object's shape and size, though how exactly this works is not yet understood. The small hairs on the rostrum of the Amazon river dolphin are believed to function as a tactile sense, possibly to compensate for their poor eyesight.|$|E

40|$|Physiological and {{compositional}} {{changes of}} 'Prince melon' fruit were investigated {{in relation to}} the characteristic quality changes of the fruit. The respiratory rise in <b>melons</b> harvested at various ages were noted with associated ethylene evolution. A marked output of carbon dioxide was also shown by tisse slices taken from <b>melons</b> harvested at mature stage and during their storage as compared with ones harvested at immature stage. The contents of glucose, fructose, sucrose, and citric acid in pulp increased during the development of the <b>melons</b> but they decreased during ripening after harvest. Glutamic acid content significantly decreased during ripening of the <b>melons</b> and in contrast alanine increased markedly. Volatiles formation in the <b>melons</b> considerably increased during storage after harvest. The relationship between refractometer index and constituents or surface color was investigated for judging the quality of the <b>melons</b> and it was concluded that Hunter a value and/or concentration of relatively high boiling point volatiles may be better for quality index...|$|R

5|$|The {{most common}} {{agricultural}} food staples during Han were wheat, barley, rice, foxtail millet, proso millet, and beans. People of the Han also consumed sorghum, Job's tears, taro, mallow, mustard green, <b>melon,</b> bottle gourd, bamboo shoot, {{the roots of}} lotus plants, and ginger. Some of the fruits the Han ate included the chestnut, jujube, pear, peach, plum (including the plum of Prunus salicina and Prunus mume), <b>melon,</b> apricot, red bayberry, and strawberry. The Han Chinese domesticated and ate chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, camels, cows, sheep, pigs, and dogs. The type of game animals hunted during the Han included rabbit, sika deer, turtle dove, goose, owl, Chinese bamboo partridge, magpie, common pheasant, and cranes, while fish and turtles were taken from streams and lakes. Beer—which could be an unfermented malt drink with low alcohol content or a stronger brew fermented with yeast—was commonly consumed alongside meat, but virtually never consumed alongside grains such as rice. Wine was also regularly consumed.|$|E

40|$|<b>Melons</b> {{can come}} into contact with bacteria, viruses or parasites at any stage of the food supply chain from {{production}} and transport to preparation in private households. Pathogens can be transferred from the skin to the flesh of the fruit when the <b>melons</b> are cut. At warm temperatures, in particular salmonella, listeria and EHEC can easily multiply on the flesh which is low in acidity. Accordingly, outbreaks of illness have in the past been triggered by the consumption of <b>melons</b> contaminated with these pathogens. In order to avoid illness, the rules of personal and kitchen hygiene should be strictly adhered to during the preparation of <b>melons.</b> For example, it is important to ensure sufficiently large and clean working areas, clean hands and to use thoroughly cleaned knives and chopping boards. These rules of hygiene are all the more important {{in view of the fact}} that a small infection dose suffices to cause an infection from pathogens such as campylobacter, EHEC and norovirus. In addition, the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) recommends to food retail stores, catering businesses and community institutions only to cut up small quantities of <b>melons</b> which can be sold to customers within about two hours. Consumers should eat cut up <b>melons</b> quickly or, alternatively, refrigerate them as soon as possible. Pieces of <b>melons</b> which have been kept unrefrigerated for several hours or exposed to high temperatures (e. g. through sunlight), should, as a precaution, be disposed of. To protect themselves against infections, especially sensitive persons should, to be on the safe side, refrain from eating cut <b>melons</b> which have been stored at room temperatures for several hours. Risk groups include pregnant women, small children as well as elderly and sick persons. These groups should think carefully before eating cut-up <b>melons,</b> if they do not know whether the fruit has been kept unrefrigerated for lengthy periods of time...|$|R

40|$|The unique {{greenhouse}} sand-culturing {{method of}} muskmelon (Cucumis melo L. var. reticulatus NAUD. (Earl's Favourite)) had established by Yuasa Experimental Farm, Kinki University. This {{is a report}} of the growth {{and the quality of the}} fruits reared in summer and autumnal seasons. The results of the investigation were as mentioned hereunder. (1) The length of the cropping season is 96 days in summer, but 98 days in case of the autumnal cultivation, slightly longer than that of the summer <b>melons.</b> In particular, the time length of their fruit maturity after their crossing was tended to be delayed. (2) The growth rate of the fruits is most spectacular for 4 ～ 17 days after the crossing. Then, the growth of the fruits became somewhat dilatory, and the sizes of the <b>melons</b> could roughly be determined for 24 ～ 32 days after the crossing. It was discovered, furthermore, that regarding the shapes of the <b>melons,</b> the vertical length of those grown in summer was longer thanthe horizontal length, but the shape of the autumnal <b>melons</b> was entirely contrary to those produced in summer. (3) Regarding the average weight of a fruit raised in summer season was 1. 4 kg and those grown in autumn was 1. 6 kg respectively. The generation of nets on the fruits of <b>melons</b> cultivated in both seasons were good. The sugar content of summer <b>melons</b> was 12. 6 ％, and that of autumnal <b>melons</b> was 12. 8 ％ respectively.

5|$|It {{is largely}} unknown how baleen whales produce sound {{because of the}} lack of a <b>melon</b> and vocal cords. In a 2007 study, it was {{discovered}} that the larynx had U-shaped folds which are thought to be similar to vocal cords. They are positioned parallel to air flow, as opposed to the perpendicular vocal cords of terrestrial mammals. These may control air flow and cause vibrations. The walls of the larynx are able to contract which may generate sound with support from the arytenoid cartilages. The muscles surrounding the larynx may expel air rapidly or maintain a constant volume while diving.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to their}} small sizes and {{high rates of}} reproduction, thrips are {{difficult}} to control using classical biological control. Suitable predators must be small and slender enough to penetrate the crevices where thrips hide while feeding, and they must also prey extensively on eggs and larvae to be effective. Only two families of parasitoid Hymenoptera parasitize eggs and larvae, the Eulophidae and the Trichogrammatidae. Other biocontrol agents of adults and larvae include anthocorid bugs of genus Orius, and phytoseiid mites. Biological insecticides such as the fungi Beauveria bassiana and Verticillium lecanii can kill thrips at all life-cycle stages. Insecticidal soap spray is effective against thrips. It is commercially available or can be made of certain types of household soap. Scientists in Japan report that significant reductions in larva and adult <b>melon</b> thrips occur when plants are illuminated with red light.|$|E
