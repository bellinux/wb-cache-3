5|$|Meanwhile, Tom (Aziz Ansari) asks Andy (Chris Pratt), April (Aubrey Plaza), Jerry (Jim O'Heir) and Donna (Retta) to {{participate}} in a new game show called Know Ya Boo, that he is hoping to pitch to networks; he admits that it is a rip-off of The Newlywed Game. It quickly becomes clear that Jerry and Donna know <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> each other than the recently married Andy and April. When April reveals her favorite band is Neutral Milk Hotel and not Andy's band Mouse Rat, Andy angrily leaves the game and they later have a big fight which causes him to quit his music. April seeks advice from Ann because, although she dislikes her, Ann previously dated Andy for several years. Ann tells April she has to be supportive of Andy no matter how she feels. The next day, April brings the other members of Mouse Rat to city hall and surprises Andy by singing one of his songs. A thrilled Andy reconciles with April.|$|E
25|$|The {{average rate}} of {{accretion}} onto Sgr A* is unusually small for a black hole of its mass and is only detectable {{because it is so}} close to Earth. It was thought that the passage of G2 in 2013 might offer astronomers the chance to learn <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> how material accretes onto supermassive black holes. Several astronomical facilities observed this closest approach, with observations confirmed with Chandra, XMM, EVLA, INTEGRAL, Swift, Fermi and requested at VLT and Keck.|$|E
25|$|The {{heroine of}} the story, Kilala is a cheerful and {{energetic}} teenage {{girl who is}} {{a big fan of}} Disney characters, especially the Disney Princesses. Kilala hopes to become like them someday, but her clumsy and spunky attitude puts her very behind. She is in a different place from her parents, and wishes to meet them again someday. Her best friend is Erica and her pet is Tippe. She newly holds the power of the princesses after awakening Rei, who she later falls in love with. She is enthusiastic about the world she is traveling in, but cares <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> her best friend's well-being. Kilala has things in common with otaku, a Japanese term for anyone who is obsessed with entertainment, or in Kilala's case, Disney works. Although this obsession seems useless in the real world, it comes to her aid in travelling in the Disney world.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of her {{experiences}} in Jamaica, Russia, Iran, China, Burma and India, and her family's friendship with people such as the Nehrus, Peggy, who was now in her mid-twenties, knew many people from many countries and also knew <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> life outside England, indeed outside Europe, than most of her contemporaries. This experience, along with her deep Christian commitments, led her to work for co-operation among peoples; and in the late 1940s she started to work for an organisation called Racial Unity, which had been started by Miss Attlee, sister of the Prime Minister, as well as becoming active in the Youth Department of the World Council of Churches (WCC). It was through her work for Racial Unity, of which she was secretary in 1952, that she first met Joseph Emmanuel Appiah, who was President of the West African Students' Union. Their friendship grew fast and in January 1952, he proposed and she accepted.|$|E

[...] Nolan said Valentine took control of [...] "the amp stuff," [...] which made sense to him [...] "because he knows so <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> that stuff". The group spent some time [...] "messing around" [...] with guitar pedals, according to Nolan. On December 8, the band posted a behind-the-scenes video of themselves in the studio. On January 10, 2011, the band announced that recording was officially completed. A week later, the band said the album's artwork was being produced and Valentine was mixing the tracks. While 11 tracks ended up on the final version of the album, a further seven or eight songs were recorded. Howie Weinberg mastered the recordings at Howie Weinberg Mastering in March.|$|E

500|$|Moore and Gibbons {{designed}} Watchmen {{to showcase}} the unique {{qualities of the}} comics medium and to highlight its particular strengths. In a 1986 interview, Moore said, [...] "What I'd like to explore is the areas that comics succeed in where no other media is capable of operating", and emphasized this by stressing the differences between comics and film. Moore said that Watchmen {{was designed to be}} read [...] "four or five times", with some links and allusions only becoming apparent to the reader after several readings. Dave Gibbons notes that, [...] "s it progressed, Watchmen became <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the telling than the tale itself. The main thrust of the story essentially hinges on what is called a macguffin, a gimmick [...] So really the plot itself is of no great consequence [...] it just really isn't the most interesting thing about Watchmen. As we actually came to tell the tale, that's where the real creativity came in." ...|$|E
500|$|Feeling {{he needed}} [...] "a period of rest", Ramsey {{returned}} to Ipswich {{to spend time}} with his wife. He became a director of sportswear manufacturer Gola Sports and of a local building firm, but kept {{out of the public eye}} for 18 months or so. He then began watching Ipswich Town, and often acted as a television pundit. Speaking on ITV's On the Ball in February 1976, he was sharply critical of England's performance against the Netherlands, describing the players as [...] "poor individually" [...] and the team as [...] "completely disorganised". Asked if he had any sympathy for his successor, Don Revie, he said that Revie did not want sympathy: [...] "Having accepted the post of England team manager he has to accept the responsibility of his position in exactly the same way as I did." [...] His attitude to the media mellowed. Interviewed in June ahead of a five-a-side tournament between eight of the 1966 World Cup teams for a trophy named in his honour, Ramsey admitted that, having [...] "met so many more people, I know so <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the world, and I'm so much more relaxed than I was three or four years ago", and said he would consider a return to management.|$|E
500|$|Derricotte {{was born}} in Fostoria, Ohio on June 14, 1926, and {{he grew up in}} Defiance, Ohio, where his father Clarence Cobb Derricotte ran a shoe repair business. In {{addition}} to Eugene, Bessie M. Anderson and Clarence Derricotte had two other sons, Bruce (b. June 22, 1928) and Raymond. [...] Gene married Jeanne E. Hagans and had a son Robert. [...] Years later, Gene Derricotte would tell a reporter friend of his that he always wondered about his ancestry. [...] He knew his name was French, but {{he was not able to}} find out <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> his roots. [...] One thing he must have known was that despite living under segregation, other members of the Derricotte family had distinguished themselves as educated professionals. A black newspaper, the Philadelphia Tribune, did a tribute to the family in November 1944, mentioning that Eugene's father was a veteran of World War I where he fought in France before returning to Defiance to open his business, marry and raise a family. [...] Eugene had an uncle (J. Flipper Derricotte) who was an attorney in Washington DC, and an aunt Juliette who had been a dean at Fisk College in Nashville TN before dying tragically after an automobile accident, when the nearby white hospital refused to admit her.

500|$|James Arnold Taylor was Tidus' English-language voice. Taylor {{was offered}} the role by voice {{director}} Jack Fletcher (who believed that he would fit the character), and translator Alexander O. Smith explained Tidus to him. In contrast to Morita, Taylor made the character friendlier and less serious with the staff's approval. After recording Final Fantasy X, Taylor {{said that he would}} enjoy voicing Tidus again; the character was [...] "like an old friend to me now. I know so <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> him now than I did when we first started, knowing hardly anything about him. I would really hate it if anybody else voiced him". Recording the game took Taylor three-and-a-half months, and he enjoyed the experience. According to Taylor, it would be unrealistic for Tidus to hide emotion. He said that although there were things he would change about his performance (such as the scene where Tidus and Yuna begin laughing together), he was grateful for the warm fan reception of his work. Smith felt that the forced-laugh scene was adapted well from the original Japanese scene, because of how [...] "stilted and out of place" [...] it was in the original version. Smith was confused by Morita and Mayuko Aoki's performance, but after discussing it with Nojima he found it well done in both languages and called it [...] "awkward" [...] and [...] "funny". When Final Fantasy X was re-released in 2013, Taylor said that he was proud to be Tidus' voice.|$|E
500|$|On February 4, 2016, Marvel {{released}} {{their own}} version of the Facebook [...] "#FriendsDay" [...] video for Captain America. The video mirrors those created by Facebook for users to celebrate the anniversary of Facebook's founding, and features images of Captain America's [...] "friends" [...] the Winter Soldier, Thor, Falcon and Hawkeye. The video concludes with an image of Captain America and Iron Man being torn in half. Jennifer Konerman of The Hollywood Reporter called the video [...] "timely" [...] and its contents [...] "especially relevant considering the storyline" [...] of Civil War. Three days later, a teaser debuted during Super Bowl 50, which received the most social media activity out of all the film trailers released that day. Anthony Breznican of Entertainment Weekly said the footage [...] "actually feels a little more like a teaser , since it shows some new shots, but really doesn’t reveal <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the story." [...] Additionally, he felt the chanting [...] "unseen voices calling out, 'United...We...Stand' and 'Divided...We...Fall'" [...] had [...] "a football stadium vibe", complimenting it appearing during the Super Bowl. Mendelson added that Marvel did not need to follow the model used for The Winter Soldier during Super Bowl XLVIII of showing a longer trailer after the teaser since Civil War was [...] "frankly [...] higher-profile sequel." [...] Overall, Mendelson felt the spot was [...] "only a little less low-key and small(er)-scale as the trailer that debuted in" [...] November 2015, and sold the [...] "real world" [...] aspect [...] "with character drama and mostly real-world action between would-be superheroes." ...|$|E

2500|$|There are {{numerous}} inaccuracies in the series' representation of various historical events and personages. Co-creator Bruno Heller has said: [...] "We try to balance between what people expect from previous portrayals and a naturalistic approach ...

Series Historical Consultant Jonathan Stamp also notes that the show aims for [...] "authenticity" [...] rather than [...] "accuracy".

2500|$|Cold {{reading is}} a set of {{techniques}} used by mentalists, psychics, fortune-tellers, mediums, illusionists (readers), and other scam artists, to imply [...] that the reader knows <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the person than the reader actually does. Without prior knowledge, a practiced cold-reader can quickly obtain {{a great deal of information}} by analyzing the person's body language, age, clothing or fashion, hairstyle, gender, sexual orientation, religion, race or ethnicity, level of education, [...] manner of speech, place of origin, etc. Cold readings commonly employ high-probability guesses, quickly picking up on signals as to whether their guesses are in the right direction or not, then emphasizing and reinforcing chance connections and quickly moving on from missed guesses. Psychologists believe that this appears to work because of the Forer effect and due to confirmation biases within people.|$|E
2500|$|The episode {{introduced}} a [...] "Then and Now" [...] structure, which utilizes flashbacks that bookend the episode; flashbacks {{were used in}} previous seasons of the television series, and were sparsely used in the graphic novels the series is based on.

And we’ll be jumping around a little bit, but I believe this is our only Then and Now." [...] Kirkman noted that the audience [...] " [...] so <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> Gareth {{and all of those}} people because of those two very minor scenes." [...] Gimple knew the backstory of Terminus while the characters were traveling there in the previous season, and stated that it echoes what happens next to Rick's group.
