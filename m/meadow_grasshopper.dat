50|$|Chorthippus parallelus, the <b>meadow</b> <b>{{grasshopper}},</b> is {{a common}} species of grasshopper found in non-arid grasslands throughout the well vegetated areas of Europe and some adjoining areas of Asia. It is a well-studied organism in the discipline of Evolutionary biology and was an early and important model system {{for the study of}} European phylogeography.|$|E
50|$|There are {{at least}} five races of the <b>meadow</b> <b>grasshopper</b> {{described}} in different regions with the Greek (C.p.tenuis), Iberian (C.p.erythropus) and central European (C.p.parallelus) forms described as separate subspecies. These subspecies {{are the result of}} the allopatric separation of Chorthippus parallelus populations into separate southern European refugia during the Pleistocene ice ages.|$|E
50|$|Leafminers, leaf beetles, loopers and leaftiers are pests on {{mangrove}} trees: Pongamia pinnata, Osbornia octodonta, Terminalia catappa, Excoecaria agallocha, Sonneratia caseolaris, and Lumnitzera littorea. <b>Meadow</b> <b>grasshoppers,</b> mole crickets, ants, and long-horned grasshoppers {{were found}} attacking some terrestrial plants and grasses.|$|R
50|$|These {{katydids}} are arboreal in habitat {{with the}} vast majority of them passing their lives in shrubs and trees, feeding on leaves and tender twigs with a potential for causing much damage when present in large numbers. This is rare, however, as they live a solitary life unlike <b>meadow</b> <b>grasshoppers,</b> thus are seldom noticed by man.The Phaneropterinae differ from locusts in their habits of oviposition. Their eggs are rarely deposited in the earth or twigs, but are either glued fast in double rows to the outer surface of slender twigs or are inserted in the edges of leaves.|$|R
50|$|Shrub areas support nesting birds such as <b>meadow</b> pipit and <b>grasshopper</b> warbler. It is {{a shelter}} area for {{invertebrates}} and small mammals.|$|R
50|$|The {{range of}} the <b>Meadow</b> <b>Grasshopper</b> extends from the Atlantic coast of Europe to the Urals. It is found from Scandinavia in the north to {{southern}} Spain and Anatolia in the south. It prefers moist vegetation and in southern regions is typically found in river valleys and at altitude (up to approx 2000m), not being found in arid areas.|$|E
5000|$|The region {{behind the}} head is {{referred}} to as the [...] "pronotal side-keels" [...] and the bars are approximately parallel in this species. Although quite similar, it can be distinguished from the <b>meadow</b> <b>grasshopper</b> Chorthippus parallelus, which also has straight pronotal side-keels, by a number of characteristics. These include its ability to fly, white stripe on female's wing, and more pointed snout. It often tends to be less brightly coloured and more straw-brown than Chorthippus parallelus.|$|E
50|$|Aside from insects, {{which include}} the <b>meadow</b> <b>grasshopper,</b> migrant birds are {{also found in the}} area, either {{arriving}} or leaving via Portland. The scrub at the reserve provides shelter and habitat for them, although it also readily invades the open areas. Some bird species include whitethroat, lesser whitethroat, meadow pipit, kestrel, green woodpecker amongst other migrant birds. On occasion both roe deer and the herd of feral goats that help to graze the cliffs on East Weares may be seen in the area. On {{the eastern edge of the}} quarry are some ponds which hold various amphibian species. The ponds are some of the very few that can be found on Portland.|$|E
40|$|Total DNA {{methylation}} {{rates are}} well known to vary widely between different metazoans. The phylogenetic distribution of this variation, however, has not been investigated systematically. We combine here publicly available data on methylcytosine content with the analysis of nucleotide compositions of genomes and transcriptomes of 78 metazoan species to trace the evolution of abundance and distribution of DNA methylation. The depletion of CpG and the associated enrichment of TpG and CpA dinucleotides are used to infer the intensity and localization of germline CpG methylation and to estimate its evolutionary dynamics. We observe a positive correlation of the relative methylation of CpG motifs with genome size. We tested this trend successfully by measuring total DNA methylation with LC/MS in orthopteran insects with very different genome sizes: house crickets, migratory locusts and <b>meadow</b> <b>grasshoppers.</b> We hypothesize that the observed correlation between methylation rate and genome size {{is due to a}} dependence of both variables from long-term effective population size and is driven by the accumulation of repetitive sequences that are typically methylated during periods of small population sizes. This process may result in generally methylated, large genomes such as those of jawed vertebrates. In this case, the emergence of a novel demethylation pathway and of novel reader proteins for methylcytosine may have enabled the usage of cytosine methylation for promoter-based gene regulation. On the other hand, persistently large populations may lead to a compression of the genome and to the loss of the DNA methylation machinery, as observed, e. g., in nematodes...|$|R
40|$|Agri-environment schemes are {{the most}} widely adopted {{political}} measure to maintain and restore farmland biodiversity in Europe. However, abiotic and biotic factors often limit the success of ecological restoration. Among the biotic factors, {{the size of the}} local and regional species pool is a major constraint. This is only well documented for plants. We therefore wanted to know if a small regional species pool can also limit restoration efforts of invertebrates. Specifically, we tested if by relocating grasshoppers from further away, we could overcome regional species pool limitations on hay meadows under the Swiss agri-environment scheme, so-called Ecological Compensation Area meadows (ECA meadows). All meadows had been under restoration for 6 years and were formerly intensively used hay <b>meadows.</b> Two <b>grasshopper</b> species, Euthystira brachyptera and Mecostethus parapleurus, were selected; E. brachyptera was not found in the regional species pool and M. parapleurus had nearly disappeared. In 2004, 1, 400 grasshopper individuals of each species were taken from the nearest large source populations and distributed equally on seven ECA meadows and seven control meadows. In 2005, we evaluated whether the species had successfully established. Only one individual of M. parapleurus was found. We conclude that a small regional species pool is not the only constraint for the reestablishment of <b>grasshoppers</b> on restoration <b>meadows.</b> Also, other factors such as habitat quality appear to constrain the reestablishment of <b>grasshoppers</b> on restoration <b>meadows.</b> Additional restoration efforts specifically targeted at grasshopper restoration are needed, and innovative techniques have to be developed to overcome the relocation constraints...|$|R
40|$|Amensalism may {{be common}} between non-trophically linked animals in natural ecosystems, where {{variation}} among species in body sizes and foraging modes may {{give rise to}} one-sided interference. However, species and ecosystem-level consequences of animal-animal amensalism are largely unknown. In a Tibetan alpine <b>meadow,</b> dominant herbivorous <b>grasshoppers</b> trigger a death feigning anti-predator response of co-occurring grassland caterpillars despite posing no consumptive threat. We hypothesized that: 1) grasshoppers reduce the performance of caterpillars while incurring no cost to themselves; and 2) this amensalism reduces top-down control of plant composition and biomass. We tested these hypotheses by factorial manipulation of both herbivores within replicate field enclosures. Grasshoppers significantly suppressed caterpillar feeding, growth rate, survival, reproductive effort and delayed metamorphosis. In contrast, grasshopper performance was unaffected by the caterpillars. Suppression of caterpillar feeding decreased overall herbivore suppression of plant biomass by 58 % and shifted the functional composition of the plant community (i. e. increased sedge: forb ratio). These results suggest that consideration of non-trophic interactions such as amensalism will help predict the consequences of species losses for the structure and functioning of ecosystems...|$|R
50|$|During the LGM, many of {{the species}} of Europe retreated south, {{out of reach of}} the ice sheet and the colder climate. These {{southern}} refugia have been shown in looking at the pathways of the common European <b>meadow</b> <b>grasshopper.</b> Through analysis of the grasshoppers’ genome it was found that they had been divided into 5 different geographical regions: Turkey, Greece, Italy, Spain, and the Balkans. Despite significant differences in the ecology of species, some general colonization patterns are observed which are often common to several species groups. These colonization entailed successive bottlenecks phenomena that led to a loss of genetic diversity in northern populations.Therefore, based on the data of numerous phylogeographic research, the high genetic diversity of populations of southern regions can often be an indication for positioning a Pleistocene refugium, while the geographical distributions of the northern populations are dictated by the colonization patterns of the refugia populations.While these southern refugia have been found for many other species of flora and fauna, there may have been high altitude refugia on the coast of northern Norway.|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{urbanization}} {{and rising}} economies are creating {{shifts in the}} composition of global food demand, so it is necessary to explore new sources of food with better nutritional profile. Among the alternative food that exists are the grasshoppers, about 80 species of which are consumed worldwide. Grasshoppers are not only rich source of proteins and lipids but also some important minor component like vitamins and minerals. Edible species of grasshopper in Belgium were identified and attempts were made for the lab rearing of <b>meadow</b> <b>grasshopper</b> (Chorthippus parallelus). The lipids as well as protein contents of <b>meadow</b> <b>grasshopper</b> (Chorthippus parallelus) & long winged conehead (Conocephalus discolor) were investigated.

40|$|Eating insects as food, {{particularly}} grasshopper {{is practiced}} in many cultures throughout the world. <b>Meadow</b> <b>grasshopper</b> (Chorthippus parallelus) is {{commonly found in}} Europe and some part of Asia. It is already known that grasshoppers of Chorthippus species are consumed as food {{in countries such as}} Thailand. With the aim of evaluating the nutritional potential of this insect species the proximate nutritional composition of grasshoppers caught from the local fields was realized. Besides this, the fatty acid profile of extracted lipids, amino acid profile and mineral composition of the insect was also revealed. Results suggest that <b>meadow</b> <b>grasshopper</b> is an excellent source of protein and essential amino acids. Lipids extracted from the grasshopper have an interesting fatty acid composition. Also the grasshopper contains some minerals that are important for body. With such protein content, amino acid profile, fatty acid profile of the lipids and mineral content this grasshopper species could present an interesting alternate to conventional protein sources...|$|E
40|$|Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (Site) {{is located}} on the Colorado Piedmont east of the Front Range between Boulder and Golden. At an {{elevation}} of approximately 6, 000 feet, the Site contains a unique ecotonal mixture of mountain and prairie plant species, resulting from the topography and close proximity to the mountain front. The Buffer Zone surrounding the Industrial Area {{is one of the largest}} remaining undeveloped areas of its kind along the Colorado Piedmont. A number of plant communities at the Site have been identified as increasingly rare and unique by Site ecologists and the Colorado Natural Heritage Program (CNHP). These include the xeric tallgrass prairie, tall upland shrubland, wetlands, and Great Plains riparian woodland communities. Many of these communities support populations of increasingly rare animals as well, including the Preble`s <b>meadow</b> jumping mouse, <b>grasshopper</b> sparrow, loggerhead shrike, Merriam`s shrew, black crowned night heron, and Hops blue and Argos skipper butterflies. One of the more interesting and important plant communities at the Site is the tall upland shrubland community. It has been generally overlooked by previous Site ecological studies, probably due to its relatively small size; only 34 acres total. Although mentioned in a plant community ordination study conducted by Clark et al. and also in the Site baseline ecological study, few data were available on this plant community before the present study...|$|R

Among the alternative food that exists are the grasshoppers, about 80 species of which are consumed worldwide. Grasshoppers are not only rich source of proteins and lipids but also some important minor component like vitamins and minerals. Apart from being nutritionally superior to most conventional meats their production results in lower emission of greenhouse gases & ammonia, risk of zoonotic infections in humans is much lower, water requirement for production is much less and have higher feed conversion ratio.

40|$|The gut {{bacterial}} {{community from}} four species of feral locusts and grasshoppers {{was determined by}} {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) analysis of bacterial 16 S rRNA gene fragments. The study revealed an effect of phase polymorphism on gut bacterial diversity in brown locusts from South Africa. A single bacterial phylotype, consistent with Citrobacter sp. dominated the gut microbiota of two sympatric populations of Moroccan and Italian locusts in Spain. There was evidence for Wollbachia sp. in the <b>meadow</b> <b>grasshopper</b> caught locally in the UK. Sequence analysis of DGGE products did not reveal evidence for unculturable bacteria and homologies suggested that bacterial species were principally Gammapoteobacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae similar to those recorded previously in laboratory reared locusts.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} thesis was to further {{disentangle}} the effect of plant species richness, composition and food plant quality on generalist insect herbivore performance in a combination of laboratory and field studies. Moreover, the effects of parental and early feeding experiences were analyzed. Finally, theoretical considerations about indirect effects of abiotic conditions on insect herbivore performance and the importance to combine knowledge of field and nutritional ecology integrate the current and other work into a review. The <b>meadow</b> <b>grasshopper</b> Chorthippus parallelus served as study organism for this thesis because its diet includes both, grasses and legumes. Furthermore, {{it is one of}} the most abundant grasshopper species in diverse meadow habitats throughout Europe. The studies have been conducted on or with food plants of meadows along a plant species diversity gradient within the biodiversity experiment BIOLOG (BIOLogical diversity and Global change funded by the BMBF 2000 - 2010), located at the border between Thuringia and Bavaria in the mid of Germany...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- We analyze {{patterns}} {{of variation in}} cuticular lipids across and within 5 populations of the <b>meadow</b> <b>grasshopper</b> Chorthippus parallelus. This reveals considerable differences between the sexes and between populations, and differences {{in the pattern of}} sexual dimorphism between populations. The presence of sexual dimorphism and the extent of differences between populations suggests that divergence has been driven by sexual selection acting through the cuticle’s role as a contact pheromone. However, those lipids which differ most between the sexes {{are not the same as}} those which vary the most between populations, suggesting that sexual selection alone is not responsible for driving divergence in cuticular composition. We also examine differences in cuticular composition with adult age, revealing that the proportion of all but one of the 14 lipid classes we identify changes significantly with age in at least one population. Overall the pattern of variation with age is fairly consistent across populations, with the proportion of shorter chain compounds increasing with age.

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract The resistance {{of a plant}} community against herbivore attack may depend on plant species richness, with monocultures often much more severely aVected than mixtures of plant species. Here, we used a plant–herbivore system to study the eVects of selective herbivory on consumption resistance and recovery after herbivory in 81 experimental grassland plots. Communities were established from seed in 2002 and contained 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 or 60 plant species of 1, 2, 3 or 4 functional groups. In 2004, pairs of enclosure cages (1 m tall, 0. 5 m diameter) were set up on all 81 plots. One randomly selected cage of each pair was stocked with 10 male and 10 female nymphs of the <b>meadow</b> <b>grasshopper,</b> Chorthippus parallelus. The grasshoppers fed for 2 months, and the vegetation was monitored over 1 year. Consumption resistance and recovery of vegetation were calculated as proportional changes in vegetation biomass.

40|$|Hybrid {{zones and}} the {{consequences}} of hybridization have contributed greatly to our understanding of evolutionary processes. Hybrid zones also provide valuable insight into the dynamics of symbiosis since each subspecies or species brings its unique microbial symbionts, including germline bacteria such as Wolbachia, to the hybrid zone. Here, we investigate a natural hybrid zone of two subspecies of the <b>meadow</b> <b>grasshopper</b> Chorthippus parallelus in the Pyrenees Mountains. We set out to test whether co-infections of B and F Wolbachia in hybrid grasshoppers enabled horizontal transfer of phage WO, similar to the numerous examples of phage WO transfer between A and B Wolbachia co-infections. While we found no evidence for transfer between the divergent co-infections, we discovered horizontal transfer of at least three phage WO haplotypes to the grasshopper genome. Subsequent genome sequencing of uninfected grasshoppers uncovered the first evidence for two discrete Wolbachia supergroups (B and F) contributing at least 448 kb and 144 kb of DNA, respectively, into the host nuclear genome. Fluorescent in situ hybridization verified the presence of Wolbachia DNA in C. parallelus chromosomes and revealed that some inserts are subspecies-specific while others are present in both subspecies. We discuss our findings in light of symbiont dynamics in an animal hybrid zone...|$|E
40|$|Although {{there are}} several {{well-established}} hypotheses for the origins of postmating isolation during allopatric divergence, there have been very few attempts, to determine their relative importance in nature. We have developed an approach based on knowledge of the differing evolutionary histories of populations within species that allows systematic comparison of the predictions of these hypotheses. In previous work, we have applied this methodology to mating signal variation and premating reproductive isolation between populations of the <b>meadow</b> <b>grasshopper</b> Chorthippus parallelus. Here we review the principles behind our approach and report a study measuring postmating isolation in {{the same set of}} populations. The populations have known and differing evolutionary histories and relationships resulting from the colonization of northern Europe following the last glaciation. We use a maximum-likelihood analysis to compare the observed pattern of postmating isolation with the predictions of the hypotheses that isolation primarily evolves either as a result of gradual accumulation of mutations in allopatry, or through processes associated with colonization, such as founder events., We also quantify the extent to which degree of postmating isolation can be predicted by genetic distance. Our results suggest that although there is only a weak correlation between genetic distance and postmating isolation, long periods of allopatry do lead to postmating isolation. In contrast to the pattern of premating isolation described in our previous study, colonization {{does not seem to be}} associated with increased postmating isolation...|$|E

40|$|Many animals show altitudinal clines in size, {{shape and}} body colour. Increases in body size and {{reduction}} in the length of body appendices in colder habitats are usually attributed to improved heat conservation at lower surface-to-volume ratios (known as Bergmann's and Allen's rule, respectively). However, the patterns are more variable and sometimes reversed in small ectotherms that are affected by shortened growing seasons. Altitude can also affect colouration. The thermal melanism hypothesis predicts darker colours under cooler conditions because of a thermoregulatory advantage. Darker colours may also be favoured at high altitudes for reasons of UV protection or habitat-dependent crypsis. We studied altitudinal variation in morphology and colour in the colour-polymorphic <b>meadow</b> <b>grasshopper</b> Pseudochorthippus parallelus based on 563 individuals from 17 populations sampled between 450 and 2, 500 m asl. Pronotum length did not change with altitude, while postfemur length decreased significantly in both sexes. Tegmen (forewing) length decreased in males, but not in females. The results indicate that while body size, as best quantified by pronotum length, was remarkably constant, extended appendices were reduced at high altitudes. The pattern thus follows Allen's rule, but neither Bergmann's nor converse Bergmann's rule. These results indicate that inference of converse Bergmann's rule based on measurements from appendices should be treated with some caution. Colour morph ratios showed significant changes in both sexes from lowland populations dominated by green individuals to high-altitude populations dominated by brown ones. The increase of brown morphs was particularly steep between 1, 500 and 2, 000 m asl. The results suggest shared control of colour in males and females and local adaptation along the altitudinal gradient following the predictions of the thermal melanism hypothesis. Interestingly, both patterns, the reduction of body appendices and the higher frequency of brown individuals, {{may be explained by}} a need for efficient thermoregulation under high-altitude conditions...|$|E
