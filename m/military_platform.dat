5000|$|The {{first serious}} {{theoretical}} work published on space travel {{by means of}} rocket power was by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in 1903. Besides being the father of astronautics he conceived such ideas as the space elevator (inspired by the Eiffel Tower), a rotating space station that created artificial gravity along the outer circumference, airlocks, space suits for extra-vehicular activity (EVA), closed ecosystems to provide food and oxygen, and solar power in space. [...] Tsiolkovsky believed human occupation of space was the inevitable path for our species. In 1952 Wernher von Braun published his own inhabited space station concept {{in a series of}} magazine articles. His design was an upgrade of earlier concepts, but he took the unique step in going directly to the public with it. The spinning space station would have three decks and was to function as a navigational aid, meteorological station, Earth observatory, <b>military</b> <b>platform,</b> and way point for further exploration missions to outer space. [...] It is said that the space station depicted in 2001: A Space Odyssey traces its design heritage to Von Braun's work. Wernher von Braun went on to devise mission schemes to the Moon and Mars, each time publishing his grand plans in Collier's Weekly.|$|E

5000|$|The Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) is/was an L band Distributed Time Division Multiple Access (DTDMA) network {{radio system}} {{used by the}} United States armed forces and their allies to support data {{communications}} needs, principally {{in the air and}} missile defense community. It produces a spread spectrum signal using Frequency-shift keying (FSK) and Phase-shift keying (PSK) to spread the radiated power over a wider spectrum (range of frequencies) than normal radio transmissions. This reduces susceptibility to noise, jamming, and interception. In Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) (supposedly like cell phone systems), each time interval (e.g. 1 second) is divided into time slots (e.g. 1024 per second). Together, all the time slots in the interval are called a [...] "frame". Each slot is [...] "bursted" [...] (transmitted) at a different frequency (FSK). Within each slot, the phase angle of the transmission burst can be varied to provide PSK. Each type of data to be transmitted is assigned a slot or block of slots (channel). In TDMA, the slot frequencies remain fixed from second to second (frame to frame). In DTDMA, the slot frequencies and/or slot assignments for each channel do not remain fixed from frame to frame but are varied in a pseudo-random manner. The slot assignments, frequencies, and information may all be encrypted to provide computer-to-computer connectivity in support of every type of <b>military</b> <b>platform</b> from Air Force fighters to Navy submarines.|$|E

40|$|The {{utility of}} {{military}} mid-IR lasers, {{particularly in the}} area of countermeasures, is well understood and practical laser systems have been fielded which currently provide protection to a wide number of <b>military</b> <b>platform</b> types. Technical performance, efficiency and power for these lasers, has driven current production designs to utilise diode pumped solid state lasers (DPSSLs) with wavelength conversion through non-linear crystals.

Moreover, this review will focus on the relative merits of the technologies for engineering and productionisation of a military laser system, and address those issues most relevant for design and manufacture for the military environment. These include not only technical performance, power and efficiency, but also thermal management, mass, volume, cost and overall complexity for manufacture...|$|E
40|$|Radar {{cross section}} {{prediction}} techniques {{are used to}} determine the radar signature of a <b>military</b> <b>platform</b> when the radar signature can not be determined experimentally, because the platform is not available or for reasons of time and cost. For classic jet aircraft the radar cross section for forward observation angles is dominated by the contribution of the open ended cavity formed by the jet engine air intake and compressor fan. This cavity is characterized by its large depth (L/d> 3), curved centerline and nonuniform cross section, for which the scattering characteristics can not by analyzed by approximate high frequency methods. Jin et al. have published a numerical method based on a higher order finite element discretisation of the Maxwell equations, where the resulting linear system is solved by means of a frontal solution method. The method takes full advantage of the topology of the cavity scattering problem and has been successfully applied for the analysis of cavities of intermediate size. In this paper an adaptation of their algorithm is discussed that can efficiently compute the electric field scattered by very large cavities, in particular the jet engine air intake cavity for X-band radar frequencies...|$|E
40|$|Rapidly {{initiated}} at the national, regional, {{and local}} levels, the American glider pilot training program came about {{due to a}} perceived need after successful German operations {{at the outset of}} World War II. Although the national program successfully produced the required number of pilots to facilitate combat operations, numerous changes and improvisation came to characterize the program. Like other American military initiatives in the twentieth century, the War Department applied massive amounts of effort, dollars, and time to a program that proved to be short-lived in duration because it was quickly discarded when new technologies appeared. At the local level, the real loser was Lamesa, Texas. Bearing the brunt of these changes by military decision makers, the citizens of Lamesa saw their hard-fought efforts to secure an airfield fall quickly by the wayside in the wake of changing national defense priorities.

40|$|Microelectronics are {{typically}} critical components in a <b>military</b> <b>platform,</b> {{some of which}} may become obsolete, before the equipment life cycle end. Obsolete components may be required for a number of reasons. Components can become obsolete even before production of a platform commences. The selection of solutions for resolving obsolete components throughout a platform can be considered as a multi-criteria optimization problem where the aim is to select the most cost effective solutions for resolving a portfolio of obsolescence arisings. In this paper we consider the case where the criteria with which the options are evaluated are not point values, but probability distributions generated by a Bayesian Belief Network. We propose the use of an evaluation technique called measures of effectiveness (MOE), that can capture and use the probabilistic information associated with potential solutions. This is used with two candidate optimization techniques, Dynamic Programming (DP) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), to identify cost effective solutions for resolving obsolescent components throughout a platform. Both optimization techniques were able to identify a number of solutions at different cost and MOE levels; the solutions that form the DP Pareto front dominate very slightly in places those that form the EA Pareto front...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} two years a MoD funded project was {{performed}} by TNO in The Netherlands to include munition vulnerability in the Vulnerability/Lethality (V/L) studies on military platforms. This effort has resulted in an initial successful combination of two knowledge domains. In this paper two case studies (a naval and a land study) will be presented as illustration of the possibilities that arise when munition vulnerability to external stimuli is included in the overall platform V/L study. Realistic threat scenarios were identified for both case studies on a platform level. Analysis of the residual threat on the munition in the platform identified the expected munition behavior. The results from this analysis are included in the platform V/L analysis. A such, the ultimate goal of this effort is to perform a V/L analysis on a <b>military</b> <b>platform</b> and not consider the munition storage as a black box and finally determine the consequences of the reaction of the munition on the survivability of the platform.

Emerald does not grant permission {{for this article}} to be further copied/distributed or hosted elsewhere without the express permission from Emerald Group Publishing Limited. "Purpose – The aim of the paper is to identify and review the impact and challenges of new contractual arrangements on UK military procurement and other limited or oligopolistic markets. Design/methodology/approach – The unit of analysis is the large-scale procurement programme. Two cases of major military platforms (naval and air defence) examine through-life maintenance or “contracting for availability” and build theory on procuring complex performance (PCP). Propositions are developed from the literature then tested and extended from the case analysis, supported by 35 interviews from buyer and supplier representatives. Findings – Examining UK <b>military</b> <b>platform</b> procurement reveals a perspective not present in fast moving high volume supply chains. In oligopolistic markets such as defence, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) represents a market of one, seeking ambitious and non-incremental innovation from the prime contractor during the procurement process. The new contractual arrangements show an increasing shift in responsibility to the prime contractor who coordinates service support and supply chain incentivisation over extended, often multi-decade platform lifecycles. Research limitations/implications – The cases were conducted separately and later compared. Whilst based on defence sources, the paper concludes with general recommendations for all public-private complex procurements and seeks to explore other industry sectors as part of further research into PCP. Originality/value – Examined from a theoretical and practical perspective, the cases reveal the challenges facing procurement in major public-private projects. The changing role identified reflects extended timescales and the quasi-market military procurement environment, compounded by current economic and politically charged conditions. Procurement by default increasingly plays a new shaping role in large-scale programme management driven by outcome-based contracting. Customers such as the MOD must re-evaluate their role under these new contractual arrangements, providing leadership and engaging with future contracting capability and innovation...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn 2013, Mandiant published a report linking one People’s Liberation Army (PLA) unit to the virtual exploitation of 11 modern U.

At the same time, the PLA has also rapidly modernized its naval, fighter jet, and air defense technologies. This thesis examines trends in Chinese cyber espionage, PLA modernization, and PLA acquisitions methods to determine—from only open-source information—if the categories are related and, if so, {{the nature of the}} relationship. Defense reports suggest there is a strong correlation between China’s virtual exfiltration of modern U. S. technology and the PLA’s rapid advancement; cyber espionage is the principal driver for PLA modernization. This thesis asks: Does cyber espionage really {{play a central role in}} PLA modernization, or does it simply complement alternate procurement methods? This thesis draws from case studies of China’s overt acquisitions, indigenous research, and physical espionage operations to demonstrate that the majority of the PLA’s modernized <b>military</b> <b>platforms</b> were developed from non-cyber acquisition methods. These studies support this thesis’s conclusion that cyber espionage is not the critical component driving forward PLA modernization. Captain,United States Air Forc...|$|R
