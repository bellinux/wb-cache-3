5|$|In {{the wake}} of a {{controversial}} speech by Zynga's president at the Game Developers Choice Awards in 2010, Bogost developed Cow Clicker for a presentation at a New York University seminar on social gaming in July 2010. The game was created to demonstrate what Bogost felt were the most commonly abused mechanics of social games, such as the promotion of social interaction and <b>monetization</b> rather than the artistic aspects of the medium. As the game unexpectedly began to grow in popularity, Bogost also used Cow Clicker to parody other recent gaming trends, such as gamification, educational apps, and alternate reality games.|$|E

This is especially true when {{there is only one}} type of physical outcome that is sought, such as the reduction of energy use by increasing energy efficiency.

These traditional merchant houses sometimes combine element from Dutch architecture which was considered luxurious, producing an eclectic architecture. Silverware flourished during this era.|$|E
25|$|A second {{approach}} has been suggested based on economics and the social welfare function. To calculate the social welfare function requires an aggregation of the impacts of climate change policies and climate change itself across all affected individuals. This calculation involves a number of complexities and controversial equity issues (Markandya et al., 2001:460). For example, the <b>monetization</b> of certain impacts on human health. There is also controversy {{over the issue of}} benefits affecting one individual offsetting negative impacts on another (Smith et al.., 2001:958). These issues to do with equity and aggregation cannot be fully resolved by economics (Banuri et al.., 1996:87).|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} assumed, on {{the authority of}} ancient commentators that Solon also reformed the Athenian coinage.

Nevertheless, there are now reasons to suggest that <b>monetization</b> had already begun before Solon's reforms. By early sixth century the Athenians were using silver {{in the form of a}} variety of bullion silver pieces for monetary payments. Drachma and obol as a term of bullion value had already been adopted, although the corresponding standard weights were probably unstable.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} {{announced}} in August 2013, and the development team wanted to carry over elements from the original Dungeon Keeper games by Bullfrog Productions, especially the humour. Richard Ridings provided the voiceovers, {{as he did with}} the previous instalments. The game is noted for its <b>monetization</b> of gameplay by relying on in-app purchases, for which it received widespread criticism. The reliance on in-app purchases also caused outcry in the gaming public. In the UK, Electronic Arts' advertising of the game was ruled to have misled customers, which forced them to amend their adverts. Electronic Arts also faced criticism over filtration of user reviews.|$|E
25|$|Privatizations {{were viewed}} by the World Bank and the IMF in the 1990s as the {{preferred}} solution for developing countries such as Argentina to overcome the debt crisis. Accordingly, the Menem administration secured special powers from Congress, which enacted new legislation in shortly after his inaugural in 1989 authorizing the sale of some 300 state enterprises for US$24 billion. The proceeds were largely channeled toward repayment and <b>monetization</b> of the US$65 billion foreign debt (90% of which {{was found in a}} 1984 Economy Ministry audit to be fraudulent in nature). The US$31 billion in Brady Bonds issued for this purpose deepened the nation's debt crisis, however, because while Argentina serviced them at face value, the bonds typically traded at a steep discount.|$|E
25|$|The {{agreement}} {{failed to}} encourage discipline by the Federal Reserve or the United States government. The Federal Reserve {{was concerned about}} {{an increase in the}} domestic unemployment rate due to the devaluation of the dollar. In attempt to undermine the efforts of the Smithsonian Agreement, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates in pursuit of a previously established domestic policy objective of full national employment. With the Smithsonian Agreement, member countries anticipated return flow of dollars to the U.S, but the reduced interest rates within the United States caused dollars to continue to flow out of the U.S. and into foreign central banks. The inflow of dollars into foreign banks continued the <b>monetization</b> process of the dollar overseas, defeating the aims of the Smithsonian Agreement. As a result, the dollar price in the gold free market continued to cause pressure on its official rate; soon after a 10% devaluation was announced in February 1973, Japan and the EEC countries decided to let their currencies float. This proved to be the beginning of the collapse of the Bretton Woods System. The end of Bretton Woods was formally ratified by the Jamaica Accords in 1976. By the early 1980s, all industrialised nations were using floating currencies.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the music}} video aspect of Yankovic's songs {{had long been}} a part of his success, RCA Records opted not to fund any video {{production}} for Mandatory Fun. Yankovic instead turned to various social media portals including Funny or Die and CollegeHumor which he had worked with in the past; these sites helped to cover the production cost of the videos with Yankovic foregoing any video ad revenue. He chose to distribute the videos to different portals to avoid burdening any single one with all of the costs and work needed to produce them. This release strategy was considered by The Atlantic as a [...] "web-enabled precision video delivery operation, and evidence of some serious digital distributional forethought" [...] as it allows the videos to be seen by different sets of audiences for each site. During an interview on Fox Business, Yankovic explained his method of funding to Stuart Varney, who seemed to misunderstand the possible <b>monetization</b> of Yankovic's videos.|$|E
500|$|In the 1990s CSG {{introduced}} the ACSR (Advanced Customer Service Representative) system. An extension to ACSR called ProfitNow! {{was introduced in}} 2003. ProfitNow! used a consumer's account data to advise customer service representatives on {{the likelihood of a}} caller cancelling their service or buying a new product. It was later turned into an online system with a user interface similar to Microsoft Windows at CSG.net. CSG purchased the Kenan FX software from Lucent Technologies in 2002. Kenan software managed billing and ordering and provided middle-ware to help various customer service and billing products integrate with each other. CSG NextGen was introduced for international markets, with support for multiple languages. In March 2014, CSG added a cybersecurity suite to its product portfolio, under the name CSG Invotas. The company released CSG Ascendon, a digital platform for communications service providers, in March 2015. The platform uses content <b>monetization</b> and delivery systems without making excessive changes to existing infrastructure. In November 2015 the Invotas unit was spun off into a separate entity.

500|$|The {{association}} of wealth with merits done has deeply affected many Buddhist countries. The relation between giving and wealth is ubiquitous in vernacular Pāli literature, and many stories of exemplary donors exist, {{such as the}} stories of Anāthapiṇḍika and Jōtika. In Buddhism, by emphasizing the usage of wealth for generosity, accumulating wealth for giving purposes thus became a spiritual practice. But using wealth in unrighteous ways, or hoarding it instead of sharing and giving it, is condemned extensively. Greed is what keeps a person wandering in Saṃsāra (the cycle of rebirth), instead of becoming liberated. It is the attachment to wealth that is an obstacle on the spiritual path, not wealth per se. Stories illustrating these themes in vernacular Buddhist literature, have profoundly influenced popular culture in Buddhist countries. Several scholars have described merit {{as a sort of}} spiritual currency or bookkeeping system. Though objections have been made against this metaphor, it is not new. Similar comparisons {{have been made in the}} Milinda Pañhā, and in seventeenth-century China. Moreover, Schopen has shown that Buddhism has had strong connections with the mercantile class, and Rotman thinks that a mercantile ethos may have informed Buddhist texts such as the Divyāvadāna. Gombrich objects to calling merit-making [...] "dry metaphysical mercantilism", but he does speculate on a historical relation between the concept of merit and the <b>monetization</b> of ancient India's economy.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in 1859, large {{quantities}} of silver were found in Nevada Territory {{and elsewhere in the}} American West. [...] In 1869, Director of the Mint Henry Linderman began advocating the end of the acceptance of silver bullion deposits to be struck into dollars. [...] Although silver dollars were not coined in large numbers, Linderman saw that mining in the West would increase after the completion of the transcontinental railroad, which it did, as US silver production increased from 10 million troy ounces in 1867 to more than 22 million five years later. Linderman foresaw that these activities would increase the supply of silver, causing its price to drop below the $1.2929 per ounce at which the precious metal in the standard silver dollar is worth $1.00. [...] He anticipated that silver suppliers would turn to the Mint to dispose of their product by striking it into dollars. [...] The <b>monetization</b> of that cheap silver, Linderman feared, would inflate the currency and drive gold from commerce because of Gresham's law. [...] Although silver advocates later called the resulting law the [...] "Crime of '73" [...] and claimed that it had been passed in a deceitful manner, the bill was discussed during five different sessions of Congress, read in full by both the House of Representatives and the Senate and printed in full on multiple occasions. [...] Once it passed both houses of Congress, it was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on February 12, 1873.|$|E

The practice has been tied to the same methods that slot machines and other gambling devices dole out rewards, as it follows a variable rate schedule. While the general perception that loot boxes are a form of gambling, the practice is only classified as such in a few countries as gambling and otherwise legal. However, methods to use those items as virtual currency for online gambling or trading for real-world money has created a skin gambling market that is under legal evaluation.|$|E
2500|$|Dungeon Keeper {{received}} {{a great deal}} of negative reception due to <b>monetization.</b> In particular, critics condemned the time the Gem Veins take to dig, forcing players to either wait or purchase Gems with real money. Leif Johnson of IGN heavily criticized the heavy reliance on in-app purchases and waiting times that were not present in the original game. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer, in addition to the microtransactions, criticized the game for being a Clash of Clans clone. He commented that Dungeon Keeper had gone free-to-play in a [...] "soulless" [...] way. The game was described by David Jenkins of the British newspaper Metro as [...] "A sickening perversion of the whole concept of video games", and commented that the game, with its reliance on microtransactions, is a danger to the video gaming industry. Jim Sterling of The Escapist echoed these sentiments, describing the game as [...] "One of the worst examples of a cancer that is eroding the market", and also criticizing the [...] "babyish" [...] characters and the lack of dark humour and appeal of the original game. Jeuxvideo.com described the game as [...] "Outrageous", and criticized the difficulty of playing without paying, as well as the behaviour of the units when confronting the enemy, although they commented that some of the humour of the original game is present. Scott Nichols of Digital Spy criticized the waiting times and commented that they render the invasions inadequate for game worth. Jaz Rignall of USGamer initially complimented the graphics and gameplay, but described the game as [...] "a sad, knock-off of a wannabe, faux-Dungeon Keeper" [...] due to the free-to-play business model. Miguel Concepcion of TabTimes heavily criticized the waiting times and how quickly the game asks for payment. Shaun Musgrave of TouchArcade stated that fans of the original games would be unhappy with the simplification and <b>monetization.</b> Peter Molyneux, creator of the original Dungeon Keeper, described the waiting times and capitalization as [...] "ridiculous", and criticized Electronic Arts for getting the balance wrong.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 19th-century, the Kalang people {{achieved}} {{a lot of}} advantages, especially with the improvement of transportation and <b>monetization</b> of the agricultural economy. Free of the Javanese value of harmony and the Islamic value of restrained economic greed (especially in taking interest of money lending), the Kalang people were able to collect great fortune from various trades, money lending and pawnshops. Before the administrative reform of the early 1920s there were two subgroups among the Kalang People of Tegalgendu: one belonging to the Surakarta Sunanate and other to the Yogyakarta Sultanate. The head of the Surakarta subgroup was given the title of mantri kalang, whose duty was to supervise carpentry services for the repair of buildings in the Royal Cemetery complex. The Yogyakarta subgroup specialized in transporting goods between the port town of Semarang and Yogyakarta, a task which was granted by the Yogyakarta court solely to this subgroup. Sometime {{around the turn of}} the century, the Surakarta subgroup obtained a license from the court to open pawnshops throughout the territory. Within a short period, they developed an extensive network of pawnshops bringing in a huge amount of profit. The Yogyakarta subgroup continued to specialize in the transportation of goods utilizing all available means — trains, motor vehicles, and horses. The [...] "monopoly" [...] of these royal tasks allow the Kalang group to accumulate great wealth.
