5000|$|On 1 March 1942 the Chief of BuDocks {{recommended}} {{that as a}} means to promote esprit de corps in the new branch of construction battalions, that an insignia be created for use on equipment similar to what air squadrons used on their aircraft. This was not something for the uniform. [...] Frank J. Iafrate, a civilian plan file clerk at Quonset Point Air National Guard Station, Rhode Island, was the artist who designed the original [...] "Disney Style" [...] Seabee in early 1942 with a large capital letter Q around the edge as border. This design was sent to Admiral Moreell who made a single request: that this reference to Quonset Point be changed to a hawser rope and it would be officially adopted. That design remains in use to this day, predominantly unchanged. In late 1942, after designing the logo, Iafrate enlisted in the Seabees. [...] It {{should be noted that the}} Camp PXs sold pennants with a different Seabee design on them that was stylistically similar to the <b>Mosquito</b> <b>boat</b> rating patch.|$|E
5000|$|The FBI leased three {{adjacent}} rooms in Times Square. One room {{would serve as}} double-agent Sebold's office from which he would receive intelligence reports from Abwehr spies that would later be censored by the FBI and partially transmitted by Sebold via coded short-wave radio to Germany. The other two rooms were used by German-speaking FBI agents who would listen in with headphones and record the meetings using a motion picture camera behind a two-way wall mirror. The first time Duquesne arrived at Sebold's office, he surprised the FBI agents by conducting {{an examination of the}} office, opening chests, looking in corners and around mirrors, and pointedly asking Sebold, [...] "where are the mics?" [...] Once Duquesne believed he was safe, he raised his pants leg and removed documents from his sock, such as: a sketch and photo of the M1 Garand semi-automatic rifle, a drawing of a new light tank design, a photo of a U.S. Navy <b>Mosquito</b> <b>boat,</b> a photo of a grenade launcher, and reports on U.S. tanks he had observed at bases at West Point and in Tennessee. Duquesne also described sabotage techniques he had used in earlier wars such as small bombs with slow fuses he could drop through a hole in his pants pocket, and he commented on where he might use these devices again.|$|E

Caption: "I'm very excited and so proud of him," exclaimed Mrs. Edward Grover Delong, left, Wednesday when told that her husband, above, was {{squadron}} engineer of a <b>mosquito</b> <b>boat</b> attack in Subic bay in which a 5, 000 -ton Japanese ship was sunk. ...|$|E
5000|$|Henry Andrew was {{reassigned to}} Fernandina, Florida on 18 March, {{and took up}} duties off Fernandina and <b>Mosquito</b> Inlet. <b>Boats</b> from the steamer and [...] entered Mosquito Inlet on a {{reconnaissance}} on 21 March and next day were fired upon by batteries and musketry, killing the captains of both Henry Andrew and Penguin. Subsequently, the ship {{was active in the}} blockade off Mosquito Inlet, Stono River, and other points on the coast until sent to Winyah Bay, South Carolina, where she arrived on 21 June.|$|R
5000|$|Shelton {{was once}} {{served by a}} small fleet of steamboats {{which was part of}} the Puget Sound <b>Mosquito</b> Fleet. These <b>boats</b> {{included}} the Old Settler, Irene, Willie, City of Shelton, Marian, Clara Brown, and S.G. Simpson. The economy was built around logging, farming, dairying and ranching as well as oyster cultivation. The Simpson Timber Company mill on Puget Sound's Oakland Bay dominated the landscape of the downtown area; the mill was sold to Sierra Pacific Industries in 2015, who are currently building a new mill. Shelton also identifies itself as the [...] "Christmas Tree Capital".|$|R
5000|$|Over convoys, the {{introduction}} of [...] "Very Long Range" [...] aircraft such as the Liberator {{and the use of}} additional escort carriers to close the air gap had a major effect in both repelling assaults and destroying U-boats. The re-introduction of air patrols over the Bay of Biscay by long range Beaufighters and <b>Mosquitoes,</b> to attack <b>boats</b> as they came and went from base, also began to take effect {{at this stage of the}} conflict. Operational analysis was used here too, to improve the efficiency both of attack methods and the weapons in use.|$|R
5000|$|The fort is {{a typical}} nineteenth century {{garrison}} - a pentagonal fortress concealed behind grassy embankments - surrounded for greater protection by a water-filled moat. Approval for construction of the fort at Lytton was given by the Parliament of Queensland in 1878. A field force of field artillery, engineers and infantry was also established to defend against a land attack by enemy forces. The government did not favour cavalry, as mounted soldiers could be recruited from the police force in an emergency [...] A small marine defence force was also developed, consisting of the two gunboats Gayundah and Paluma, the torpedo <b>boat</b> <b>Mosquito</b> {{and a number of}} armed barges.|$|R
50|$|Encouraged by the {{worldwide}} success of 633 Squadron, producer Walter Mirisch proposed {{a series of}} British made films with a military theme having major American stars in the lead that would comply with the Eady Levy requirements and cost no more than $1 million US$. This film {{was the first of}} the series of John C. Champion's Oakmont Productions and began shooting in May 1967. The others were Submarine X-1, Hell <b>Boats,</b> <b>Mosquito</b> Squadron, The Thousand Plane Raid and The Last Escape. Each of the films was approximately 90 minutes long making them suitable for half of a double feature and had a Hollywood star leading the cast (Lloyd Bridges in this film's case).|$|R
50|$|One of {{the many}} {{outcomes}} of the Jervois-Scratchley reports was {{the formation of the}} Queensland Maritime Defence Force in 1883. Its purpose was to assist in the defence of Queensland's extensive coastline. To equip the new force the colonial government purchased two gunboats and a torpedo boat whilst port facilities and headquarters were established at Kangaroo Point, Brisbane. The gunboats Paluma and Gayundah were ordered from the shipyards of Armstrong, Mitchell and Company and featured a shallow draft capable of operating in the many bays and estuaries along the coast. Gayundah served as a training ship and conducted the first ship to shore radio transmissions in Australia whilst Paluma was loaned to the Royal Navy to carry out survey work on the Great Barrier Reef and along the Australian east coast. The torpedo <b>boat</b> <b>Mosquito</b> was ordered from Thornycroft of Chiswick. Mosquito was never commissioned but simply placed into service when required.|$|R
40|$|In the Peruvian Amazon, the dengue vector Aedes aegypti is {{abundant}} in large urban centers such as Iquitos. In recent years, {{it has also}} been found in a number of neighboring rural communities with similar climatic and socioeconomic conditions. To better understand Ae. aegypti spread, we compared characteristics of communities, houses, and containers in infested and uninfested communities. We conducted pupal-demographic surveys and deployed ovitraps in 34 communities surrounding the city of Iquitos. Communities surveyed were located along two transects: the Amazon River and a 95 km highway. We calculated entomological indices, mapped Ae. aegypti presence, and developed univariable and multivariable logistic regression models to predict Ae. aegypti presence at the community, household, or container level. Large communities closer to Iquitos {{were more likely to be}} infested with Ae. aegypti. Within infested communities, houses with Ae. aegypti had more passively-filled containers and were more often infested with other mosquito genera than houses without Ae. aegypti. For containers, large water tanks/drums and containers with solar exposure were more likely to be infested with Ae. aegypti. Maps of Ae. aegypti presence revealed a linear pattern of infestation along the highway, and a scattered pattern along the Amazon River. We also identified the geographical limit of Ae. aegypti expansion along the highway at 19. 3 km south of Iquitos. In the Peruvian Amazon, Ae. aegypti geographic spread is driven by human transportation networks along rivers and highways. Our results suggest that urban development and oviposition site availability drive Ae. aegypti colonization along roads. Along rivers, boat traffic is likely to drive long-distance dispersal via unintentional transport of <b>mosquitoes</b> on <b>boats...</b>|$|R
40|$|Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne {{virus in}} the family Bunyaviridae that has spread {{throughout}} continental Africa to Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula. The establishment of RVFV in North America would have serious consequences for human and animal health {{in addition to a}} significant economic impact on the livestock industry. Specific objectives of this thesis are to identify high-risk regions involved in RVFV importation to the U. S., evaluate pathways of introduction, and theoretically quantify the relative importance of local vectors and vertebrate hosts to RVFV transmission should the virus reach the U. S. To estimate the relative risk of RVFV introduction to the U. S., the number of infectious mosquitoes arriving in the U. S. was quantified for five pathways: infected mosquitoes arriving by airplane, infected <b>mosquitoes</b> arriving by <b>boat,</b> infected <b>mosquitoes</b> arriving through tire trade, infected humans arriving by flight, and the trade of infected mammals. Results suggest that mosquito transport by airplane, mosquito transport by ship, and human travel are important pathways for RVFV introduction to the U. S. New York, Houston, Washington D. C., and Atlanta are high-risk regions for RVFV introduction in the U. S. Further, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, Senegal, Ethiopia, Yemen and Angola are identified as regions at-risk for importing RVFV to the U. S. Published and unpublished data on RVFV vector competence, vertebrate host competence, and mosquito feeding patterns from the United States were combined to quantitatively implicate mosquito vectors and vertebrate hosts that may be important to RVFV transmission in the United States. A viremia-vector competence relationship based on published mosquito transmission studies was used to calculate a vertebrate host competence index which was then combined with mosquito blood feeding patterns to approximate the relative contribution of a mosquito or vertebrate host to RVFV transmission. Results implicate several Aedes spp. mosquitoes and vertebrates in the order Artiodactyla as important hosts for RVFV transmission in the U. S. Moreover, this study identifies critical gaps in knowledge necessary to comprehensively evaluate the different contributions of mosquitoes and vertebrates to potential RVFV transmission in the U.
