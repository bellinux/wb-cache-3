For example, galena, an ore of lead, is usually found in large pieces within its gangue, so it does not normally need extensive processing to remove it; but cassiterite, the chief ore of tin, is usually disseminated as very small crystals throughout its gangue, so when it is mined from hard rock, the ore-bearing rock first needs to be crushed very finely, and then has to be subjected to sophisticated processes to separate the ore.|$|E
40|$|Bacteria of Bacillus genus from Banská Hodrua {{ore deposit}} and from Horná Prievrana kaolin deposit caused a more {{intensive}} destruction of silicate minerals by their activity, especially by the metabolites production. Their activity resulted {{to the development}} of corrosive and enantiomorphic holes on silicate minerals surface when sulphidic minerals were released and the metals were extracted into solution. The monitoring of Bacillus spp. occurrence in various deposits with silicate minerals composition suggested that these bacteria can be found in several deposits and waste dumps with silicate minerals at Slovakia. The widest species representation was detected in samples from the Horná Prievrana kaolin deposit. The experiments with primary silicates showed either a more intensive destruction of silicate minerals accompanied by sulphides releasing from these minerals or a more intensive metals extraction from sulphidic <b>minerals</b> after ore <b>dressing.</b> The important percentage of precious metals extraction (30 % of gold and 30 % of argentine) from silicate minerals can suggest a possibility of the regulation of cyanides use in precious metals winning. A process for biological removal of elements from the samples {{was the result of the}} cultivation of organic acids - producing strains of the genus Bacillus. Hovewer, these bacteria synthesized also polysaccharides during bioleaching. Extensive acidic mucopolysaccharide films, which entrapped mineral particles, were identified by the ruthenium red staining. Ore bioleaching can not compete with physical and chemical methods in the rapidity of metal extraction from rich ores without ecological criterion. However, biotechnology becomes an alternative way in metals extraction from poor ores or wastes from the economical as well as the ecological view. The laboratory experiments with secondary silicates confirmed various forms of iron binding in kaolins and an important influence of the iron binding form on the Fe releasing during the bacterial leaching of kaolin. The release of the structural element, dissolved Fe from mica, and Fe from oxyhydroxides were used as indicators of the mineral dissolution and beneficiation of kaolin quality in this study report. They confirmed that bacteria of Bacillus genus are capable of a significant (52 %) iron removal in different times from kaolin either found as oxyhydroxides or also when it is bound in the mica structure. The significant enrichment by fine-grained fraction as a result of bacterial leaching is important also for the quality improvement of kaolins. These experimental results are important also for a possible development of a new industrial technology of kaolin raw material treatment. Bacteria and fungi interact with clay minerals and synthesize an array of organic compounds that have been shown to affect the mobility of metal ions...|$|R
40|$|The article {{describes}} radiation {{conditions in the}} Kaluga region 30 years after the Chernobyl NPP accident. The Chernobyl NPP accident caused radioactive contamination of nine Kaluga region territories: Duminichsky, Zhizdrinsky, Kuibyshevsky, Kirovsky, Kozelsky, Ludinovsky, Meshchovsky, Ulyanovsky and Hvastovichsky districts. Radioactive fallout was the strongest in three southern districts: Zhizdrinsky, Ulyanovsky and Hvastovichsky, over there cesium- 137 contamination density is from 1 to 15 Ci/km. According to the Russian Federation Government Order in 2015 there are 300 settlements (S) in the radioactive contamination zone, including 14 settlements with caesium- 137 soil contamination density from 5 to 15 Ci/ km 2 and 286 settlements with the contamination density ranging from 1 to 5 Ci/km 2. In the first years after the Chernobyl NPP accident in Kaluga region territories, contaminated with caesium- 137, there were introduced restrictive land usage, were carried out agrochemical activities (ploughing, <b>mineral</b> fertilizer <b>dressing),</b> there was toughened laboratory radiation control over the main doze-forming foodstuff. All these measures facilitated considerable decrease of caesium- 137 content in local agricultural produce. Proceeding from the achieved result, in 2002 there took place the transition to more tough requirements SanPiN 2. 3. 2. 1078 - 01. Analysis of investigated samples from Zhizdrinsky, Ulyanovsky and Hvastovichsky districts demonstrated that since 2005 meat samples didn’t exceed the standard values, same for milk samples since 2007. Till the present time, the use of wild-growing mushrooms, berries and wild animals meat involves radiation issues. It was demonstrated that average specific activity of caesium- 137 in milk samples keeps decreasing year after year. Long after the Chernobyl NPP accident, the main products forming internal irradiation doses in population are the wild-growing mushrooms and berries. Population average annual effective doses, caused 90 by Chernobyl fallouts, do not exceed 1 mSv/year. In 2014 AAEDmaximum calculated value for adultpopulation of 0, 91 mSv {{was established in the}} following settlements:, Martynki village(Ulyanovsky district) and Lovatyanka village (Hvastovichsky district). The doses, accumulated in the period after the accident, are generally not high. According to calculations numerical value of forecasted accumulated doses varies from 0, 23 to 21 mSv. Maximum calculated values of 21 mSv are established in Hvastovichsky district (Lovatyanka village) and Ulyanovsky district (Martynki village). Between 1986 and 2005, the effective irradiation doses did not exceed 29 mSv. Hence, in 70 years after the Chernobyl NPP accident standard value of 70 mSv will not be exceeded in the Kaluga region settlements. After 30 years, the main cause of population internal exposure is consumption of products from private subsidiary farms and especially of wild-growing products. There was conducted radiation monitoring of local agricultural foodstuff produce and of products from the forest. It demonstrated that caesium- 137 average specific activity in samples of milk from private subsidiary farms in settlements of Zhizdrinsky, Ulyanovsky and Hvastovichsky districts decreased several-fold. It is between 20, 0 Bq/l in 2007 and 1, 7 Bq/l in 2015. In 2015, maximum levels of caesium- 137 contamination in milk was 3, 1 % of the standard value, in potatoes - 4, 7 %, in meat - 4, 4 %. Average specific activity of caesium- 137 in forest mushrooms samples from Zhizdrinsky, Ulyanovsky and Hvastovichsky districts doesn’t decline. Peaks of average caesium- 137 activity were observed in 2012, 2013 and 2014; they depend on mushrooms abundance, species, dry summer weather and locations of sampling in the forest. In 2015 in three southern districts, the maximum content of caesium- 137 in mushrooms exceeded the permissible level (500 Bq/kg) 4, 5 -fold; about 2 % of the samples do not correspond to it. The maximum contamination of berries with caesium- 137 also exceeds the permissible level (160 Bq/kg) nearly 5 -fold, and about 43 % of samples don’t correspond to it. Obtained results have demonstrated that long after the Chernobyl NPP accident (30 years) the main part of population internal exposure is caused by consumption of wild- growing mushrooms and berries. In the recent years, milk consumption does not play a considerable role in forming of internal dose any more. Conclusion: in 30 years since Chernobyl NPP accident in the Kaluga region radiation and environment conditions have considerably improved on the territories with radionuclides contamination. However, problems remain. The major task for mitigation of the Chernobyl NPP accident consequences is comprehensive radiation, social and economic rehabilitation of the contaminated territories...|$|R

The present work involves a meticulous {{study of the}} effect of the various parameters on the performance of a ball mill.

An attempt has been made to develop correlation for the performance of the ball mill by correlating these variables with the grindability on the basis of dimensional analysis approach as well as fractional factorial design method. It is observed that these parameters influence the performance of the ball mill significantly. The performance of a ball mill is measured with reference to the quantity of undersize or fines (amount of grounded material passing through 120 mesh screen) per revolution of the mill, collected for variation of each of the individual parameters. Finally the calculated values of the fines in terms of the grindability of the mill obtained through the correlations by both the above-mentioned methods are compared with the experimental values thereby justifying the analysis with reasonable deviations.

40|$|Ideas {{introduced}} by Vaniman, Pettit and Heiken in their 1988 Uses of Lunar Sulfur are expanded. Particular attention {{is given to}} uses of SO 2 as a mineral-dressing fluid. Also introduced {{is the concept of}} using sulfide-based concrete {{as an alternative to the}} sulfur-based concretes proposed by Leonard and Johnson. Sulfur is abundant in high-Ti mare basalts, which range from 0. 16 to 0. 27 pct. by weight. Terrestrial basalts with 0. 15 pct. S are rare. For oxygen recovery, sulfur must be driven off with other volatiles from ilmenite concentrates, before reduction. Troilite (FeS) may be oxidized to magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and SO 2 gas, by burning concentrates in oxygen within a magnetic field, to further oxidize ilmenite before regrinding the magnetic reconcentration. SO 2 is liquid at - 20 C, the mean temperature underground on the Moon, at a minimum of 0. 6 atm pressure. By using liquid SO 2 as a <b>mineral</b> <b>dressing</b> fluid, all the techniques of terrestrial mineral separation become available for lunar ores and concentrates. Combination of sulfur and iron in an exothermic reaction, to form iron sulfides, may be used to cement grains of other minerals into an anhydrous iron-sulfide concrete.

The influences of molten salt addition and composition, ferric oxide dosage, smelting temperature and duration on extraction efficiency of antimony were investigated in details, respectively. The optimum conditions were determined as follows: 1. 0 time stoichiometric requirement (α) of mixed sodium salt (αsalt = 1. 0), WNaCl:Wsalt = 40 %, αFe 2 O 3 = 1. 0, Wcoke:Wstibnite = 40 %, where W represents weight, smelting at 850 °C (1123 K) for 60 min. Under the optimum conditions, the direct recovery rate of antimony can reach 91. 48 %, and crude antimony with a purity of 96. 00 % has been achieved. 95. 31 % of sulfur is fixed {{in form of}} FeS {{in the presence of}} iron oxide. Meanwhile, precious metals contained in stibnite concentrate are enriched and recovered comprehensively in crude antimony.

40|$|IMPC, the International Mineral Processing Congress {{has been}} in {{existence}} now for more than fifty five years. The very first congress was held in September 1952 as a symposium on <b>Mineral</b> <b>Dressing</b> in London, organized by the then Institution of Mining and Metallurgy (IMM), which coincided with its 60 th years’ celebrations. The symposium {{was held in the}} Imperial School of Science and Technology, London. With 39 technical papers and 332 delegates, it was indeed an impressive beginning to what is known today as IMPC. IMPC has been a major driving force for the promotion of scientific and technical knowledge in mineral processing and extractive metallurgy worldwide. It is the most prestigious event in the field of mineral processing in the world today. The congress has been truly international with delegates {{from all parts of the}} world deliberating on issues facing the industry over a period of five days. Prof. Cyril O’Connor took over as the Chairman of the IMPC council from Prof. Eric Forssberg in Istanbul. Prof. Forssberg very ably steered the IMPC council for twenty-one years before passing on the baton to Prof. O’Connor. Since the year 1995, IMPC has started honouring an eminent personality with a Lifetime Achievement Award during each Congress. The proud winners of the IMPC Lifetime Achievement Award include Prof. Douglas Fuerstenau (1995), Prof K. Schonert (1997), Prof Jean Cases (2000), Prof. Peter King (2003), Prof. H Schubert (2006) and Prof Janusz Laskowski (2008). In 2008 at the Beijing Congress the prestigious IMPC Council Award, for outstanding and noteworthy contributions to the activities of the Council and its various activities was awarded for the first time to Professor Nathaniel Arbiter. With new challenges facing the mining and mineral processing industry today, the importance of IMPC as an international forum where the latest advances in the field are shared amongst the participants both formally and informally is going to increase in the coming decades. The technical exhibition organized as a part of IMPC showcases the new process technologies, instruments and equipments and provides an occasion to make and/or renew professional contacts and build business relationships. IMPC has become an international event where the technical and business experts present their views on the challenges facing the industry and the new directions which need to be taken to face them. It is indeed a professionally rewarding experience to participate in IMPC for all the delegates. Mining, mineral and metal industries worldwide, in particular in China and India are witnessing unprecedented growth rates. The challenges facing the industry are also different from those in the past. Land and water scarcity are likely to be technological drivers in the near future. Environment compliance will be dictating the choice of technology options in the project under development. Exciting times are on the horizon for those who dare to dream and innovate. All this excitement and coming up with innovative solutions will be shared by the professional leaders with the delegates during forthcoming mineral processing congresses. The history of the IMPCs has been well documented by our colleague Fathi Habashi. It may be interesting for those currently active in the world of mineral processing to be reminded this history which is available at [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{hazards of}} lead in the {{environment}} have {{been a matter of}} increasing concern over the past several years. The most common sources of lead contaminated soils are those related to abandoned lead battery reclamation sites. There are over 200 such sites in the United States and several real and potential sites in Minnesota. Under present regulations such contaminated soil must be removed and placed in an approved and licensed landfill. The {{purpose of this study was}} to demonstrate that by applying conventional <b>mineral</b> <b>dressing</b> techniques it is possible to detoxify a significant percentage of the soil and thereby reduce the cost of landfill disposition. Prior test work at the Natural Resources Research lnstitute's Coleraine Minerals Research Laboratory (CRL) on a sample from a battery reprocessing site in Wisconsin demonstrated that partial detoxification of the soil was practical. The object of this study was to apply similar techniques to material from a Minnesota site. The Shafer Metal site on north Plymouth avenue in Minneapolis was selected for this study after consultation with personnel from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and the Minnesota Department of Transportation who own the property. The lead contamination at the Shafer Metal battery reprocessing site occurs in three principal modes: lead metal fragments, surficial coatings of precipitated lead sulphate and lead dioxide, and lead incorporated into fused plastic material. The lead metal consists primarily of fragments of battery plates and connectors. The precipitated lead compounds occur as coatings on the rock and sand particles in the soil. The fused plastic material could have resulted from melting and casting of the lead, or operation of an incinerator. After preliminary sampling to confirm the distribution of lead contaminated soil at the site, three bulk samples of about 800 pounds each were collected for testing. These three samples were subjected to a series conventional mineral processing techniques involving attrition scrubbing, screening, and gravity separation. The tests demonstrated that over 60 % of the material can be separated as a clean rock and sand product that can be disposed of on site. About 5 % to 10 % of the material can be recovered as a lead-rich product that would be acceptable feedstock to a lead smelter. About 25 % of the weight would contain so much lead that it would have to be treated as hazardous material. Some 5 % to 10 % of the material would be rejected as a coarse trash product eligible for disposal in conventional landfills. The EPA Synthetic Precipitation Leach Test for Soils (Method 1312) was run on the rock and clean sand portion which represents over 60 % of the material. The tests demonstrated that this material had been effectively detoxified and could be disposed of on site. Based on these test data a treatment flow sheet to detoxify the material represented by the bulk samples taken at the Shafer Metal site was developed. The flow sheet includes the following process steps: I) Coarse screening to remove tramp trash; 2) attrition scrubbing to remove the lead compounds from the coarser rock and sand particles; and 3) gravity concentration to separate a high lead product, a clean rock and sand reject, and a lead-bearing fused plastic product. A minus 165 mesh fines fraction is also produced containing the natural fines from the soil and the lead released by the attrition scrubbing. The recommended treatment flow sheet is based on using conventional mineral processing equipment. The equipment could be sized small enough to be truck mounted, or set up as semi-portable units for on-site treatment. Engineering such a portable treatment plant was included in the extended project, but is beyond the scope of this abbreviated study. Whether treatment of the Shafer Metal site is practical depends upon the cost of building and operating such a treatment plant on site as opposed to direct disposal. It is recommended that this study be extended to include the design and engineering of a portable or semi-mobile treatment plant and that further continuous pilot plant operations be supported to confirm some of the coarse gravity separation steps. There are other similar sites in Minnesota that are contaminated by lead that would be amenable to similar treatment. Costing out the plant required and demonstration of the viability of the treatment flow sheet would make it possible to offer alternatives to the expensive disposal of such hazardous material in a licensed disposal site.
