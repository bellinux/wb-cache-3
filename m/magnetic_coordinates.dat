40|$|Geospace {{phenomena}} {{such as the}} aurora, plasma motion, ionospheric {{currents and}} associated magnetic field disturbances are highly organized by Earth’s main magnetic field. This {{is due to the}} fact that the charged particles that comprise space plasma can move almost freely along magnetic field lines, but not across them. For this reason it is sensible to present such phenomena relative to Earth’s magnetic field. A large variety of <b>magnetic</b> <b>coordinate</b> systems exist, designed for different purposes and regions, ranging from the magnetopause to the ionosphere. In this paper we review the most common <b>magnetic</b> <b>coordinate</b> systems and describe how they are defined, where they are used, and how to convert between them. The definitions are presented based on the spherical harmonic expansion coefficients of the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) and, in some of the coordinate systems, the position of the Sun which we show how to calculate from the time and date. The most detailed coordinate systems take the full IGRF into account and define magnetic latitude and longitude such that they are constant along field lines. These coordinate systems, which are useful at ionospheric altitudes, are non-orthogonal. We show how to handle vectors and vector calculus in such coordinates, and discuss how systematic errors may appear if this is not done correctly...|$|R

Although some species of bird, fish, insect, mammal, and reptile are capable of drift compensation, our understanding of the spatial reference frame, and associated coordinate space, in which these navigational behaviors occur remains limited. Using high resolution satellite-monitored GPS track data, we show that juvenile ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) are capable of non-stop constant course movements over open ocean spanning distances in excess of 1500 km despite the perturbing effects of winds and the lack of obvious landmarks. These results are best explained by extreme navigational precision in an exogenous spatio-temporal reference frame, such as positional orientation relative to Earth’s magnetic field and pacing relative to an exogenous mechanism of keeping time.

To verify that this property is fulfilled, we specify a synthetic test potential in <b>magnetic</b> <b>coordinates</b> and calculate corresponding field values through Eqs. (10)–(12).

In the following, we formulate ΔB in terms of scalar potentials in apex coordinates. The benefit of using <b>magnetic</b> apex <b>coordinates</b> is that the perturbation field is better organized by these coordinates, and presumably fewer parameters are needed to describe the fields (Sabaka et al. 2002).

40|$|The {{effect of}} ergodization, either by {{additional}} coils like in TEXTOR-dynamic ergodic divertor (DED) or by intrinsic plasma effects like in W 7 -X, defines {{the need for}} transport models {{that are able to}} describe the ergodic configuration properly. A prerequisite for this is the concept of local <b>magnetic</b> <b>coordinates</b> allowing a correct discretization with minimized numerical errors. For these coordinates the appropriate full metric tensor has to be known. To study the transport in complex edge geometries (in particular for W 7 -X) two possible methods are used. First, a finite-difference discretization of the transport equations on a custom-tailored grid in local <b>magnetic</b> <b>coordinates</b> is used. This grid is generated by field-line tracing to guarantee an exact discretization of the dominant parallel transport (thus also minimizing the numerical diffusion problem). The perpendicular fluxes are then interpolated in a plane (a toroidal cut), where the interpolation problem for a quasi-isotropic system has to be solved by a constrained Delaunay triangulation (keeping the structural information for magnetic surfaces if they exist) and discretization. All toroidal terms are discretized by finite differences. Second, a Monte Carlo transport model originally developed for the modelling of the DED configuration of TEXTOR is used. A generalization and extension of this model was necessary {{to be able to handle}} W 7 -X. The model solves the transport equations with Monte Carlo techniques making use of mappings of local <b>magnetic</b> <b>coordinates.</b> The application of this technique to W 7 -X in a limiter-like configuration is presented.

30|$|The annual {{oscillation}} {{observed at}} the Earth’s surface (Malin and Isikara 1976), before any treatment to minimise it, also presents a dominant quadrupolar structure. However, the geographic coordinate system used in Malin and Isikara (1976) {{and in the}} present study is arguably not the most appropriate system to represent magnetic fields with sources in the magnetosphere. As a matter of fact, Shore et al. (2016) calculated EOFs in the solar magnetic system to make the external field as static as possible in their chosen reference frame. They nevertheless also detected an annual oscillation and interpreted it {{as the result of a}} North-South oscillation of the system of external currents arising from the seasonal motion of the Sun in the solar <b>magnetic</b> <b>coordinate</b> system. Shore et al. (2016) showed the annual oscillation (see their Figure 6 b) as a function of the magnetic local time defined in this coordinate system. They did not state whether the signal would be static in the geocentric solar magnetic system used by Barrois et al. (2018) to calculate, in addition to the solar magnetic system, some of the external field subtracted from the VO series.

40|$|Both stellarators and tokamaks {{can have}} quite complex {{magnetic}} topologies in the plasma edge. Special complexity is introduced by ergodic effects producing stochastic domains. Conventional numerical methods from fluid dynamics {{are not applicable}} in this case. In the present paper, we discuss two alternative possibilities. Our multiple coordinate system approach (MCSA) [Phys. Plasmas 8 (2001) 916] originally developed for the TEXTOR DED allows modelling of plasma transport in general magnetic field structures. The main idea of the concept is: magnetic field lines can exhibit truly stochastic behavior only for large distances (compared to the Kolmogorov length), while for smaller distances, the field remains regular. Thus, one can divide the computational domain into a finite set of sub-domains, introduce local <b>magnetic</b> <b>coordinate</b> systems in each and use an `interpolated cell mapping' technique to switch between the neighboring coordinate systems. A 3 D plasma fluid code (E 3 D, based upon MCSA) is applied to realistic geometries. We also introduce here some new details of the algorithm (stellarator option). The results obtained both for intrinsic (stellarator) and external (tokamak with ergodic divertor) perturbations of the magnetic field are discussed.
