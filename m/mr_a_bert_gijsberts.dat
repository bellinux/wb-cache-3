50|$|Being able to {{position}} a data signal {{relative to a}} clock signal with very high resolution and accuracy is an important capability in <b>a</b> <b>BERT.</b> This feature is used on the output of a data generator to ensure the clock signal rising edge corresponds {{to the middle of}} the data signal's bit window, since both signals will use different cabling and routing and can be mis-matched. The capability is also used on the receiver side of <b>a</b> <b>BERT</b> where <b>a</b> separate delay device is used to evaluate BER when the clock signal is not perfectly aligned in the middle of the data signal's bit cell. As the clock signal approaches either side of the data bit cell window, the quantity of errors will rise and the steepness of the rise is based on the amount of jitter between the clock and data signals. This type of analysis is called a Bathtub Curve, which demonstrates a degree of system margin. This is an example of a signal integrity physical-layer test, utilizing BER measurement capability combined with accurate time delay capability.|$|R

50|$|BER and jitter are {{functions}} of the entire MGT connection, including the MGTs themselves, their serial lines, their reference clocks, their power supplies, and the digital systems that create and consume their parallel data. As a result, MGTs are often measured by how little jitter they transmit (Jitter Transfer/Jitter Generation), and how much jitter they can tolerate before their BER is too high (Jitter Tolerance). These measurements are commonly taken using <b>a</b> <b>BERT,</b> and analyzed using an Eye diagram.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>BERT</b> {{typically}} {{consists of}} a test pattern generator and a receiver that can be set to the same pattern. They {{can be used in}} pairs, with one at either end of a transmission link, or singularly at one end with a loopback at the remote end. BERTs are typically stand-alone specialised instruments, but can be personal computer-based. In use, the number of errors, if any, are counted and presented as a ratio such as 1 in 1,000,000, or 1 in 1e06.|$|R
