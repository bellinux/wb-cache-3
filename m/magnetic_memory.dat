5|$|Bismuth is {{also used}} in aluminium-silicon cast alloys in order to refine silicon morphology. However, it {{indicated}} a poisoning effect on modification of strontium (Sr). Some bismuth alloys, such as Bi35-Pb37-Sn25, are combined with non-sticking materials such as mica, glass and enamels because they easily wet them allowing to make joints to other parts. Addition of bismuth to caesium enhances the quantum yield of caesium cathodes. Sintering of bismuth and manganese powders at 300°C produces a permanent magnet and magnetostrictive material, which is used in ultrasonic generators and receivers working in the 10–100kHz range and in <b>magnetic</b> <b>memory</b> devices.|$|E

Consequently, many groups have devoted great efforts into synthesis of additional single-molecule magnets; however, the Mn12O12 complex and analogous complexes remain the canonical single-molecule magnet with a 50cm−1 spin anisotropy.|$|E

50|$|The <b>magnetic</b> shape <b>memory</b> effect {{occurs in}} the low {{temperature}} martensite phase of the alloy, where the elementary cells composing the alloy have tetragonal geometry.

40|$|As a {{new type}} of smart material, <b>magnetic</b> shape <b>memory</b> alloy has the {{advantages}} of a fast response frequency and outstanding strain capability in the field of microdrive and microposition actuators. The hysteresis nonlinearity in <b>magnetic</b> shape <b>memory</b> alloy actuators, however, limits system performance and further application. Here we propose a feedforward-feedback hybrid control method to improve control precision and mitigate the effects of the hysteresis nonlinearity of <b>magnetic</b> shape <b>memory</b> alloy actuators. First, hysteresis nonlinearity compensation for the <b>magnetic</b> shape <b>memory</b> alloy actuator is implemented by establishing a feedforward controller which is an inverse hysteresis model based on Krasnosel’skii-Pokrovskii operator. Secondly, the paper employs the classical Proportion Integration Differentiation feedback control with feedforward control to comprise the hybrid control system, and for further enhancing the adaptive performance of the system and improving the control accuracy, the Radial Basis Function neural network self-tuning Proportion Integration Differentiation feedback control replaces the classical Proportion Integration Differentiation feedback control. Utilizing self-learning ability of the Radial Basis Function neural network obtains Jacobian information of <b>magnetic</b> shape <b>memory</b> alloy actuator for the on-line adjustment of parameters in Proportion Integration Differentiation controller. Finally, simulation results show that the hybrid control method proposed in this paper can greatly improve the control precision of <b>magnetic</b> shape <b>memory</b> alloy actuator and the maximum tracking error is reduced from 1. 1 % in the open-loop system to 0. 43 % in the hybrid control system...|$|R
