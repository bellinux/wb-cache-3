While packing for the trip, Moe is confronted by his own conscience, {{in the form of}} Homer, who <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> bad for his betrayal.

5|$|Frustrated that Gee {{refuses to}} {{consider}} the possibility of a police shooting, Pembleton assures him he will get a confession out of Staley, whether he did it or not. Pembleton starts the interrogation calm and polite, but gradually becomes angrier, frightening Staley. Pembleton <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> responsible for allowing Cox to be at the crackhouse, and uses that guilt to break Staley down and confess, even though he is obviously innocent. Pembleton gives the confession to Gee, who is conflicted, especially when Pembleton compares it to past police practices of white detectives getting confessions from black suspects no matter what the cost. Ultimately, Gee tears up the confession and instead visits Staley at jail. Staley admits to Gee that Lt. Jimmy Tyron (Michael S. Kennedy) shot Cox in the back without warning while Cox was running away. Pembleton and Bayliss arrest Tyron at his home, where they confiscate a gun and bullets that appear to match those used against Cox. The arrest deeply saddens Howard, who had previously had an affair with Tyron. The affair ended because Tyron was married with children, but Howard continues to harbor romantic feelings for him.|$|E

2500|$|Rimmer's {{status as}} a {{hologram}} in most episodes of Red Dwarf is shown by the [...] "H" [...] on the centre of his forehead, leading to nicknames from the Cat, such as [...] "alphabet head" [...] and [...] "goalpost head". Rimmer keeps his unmanageable hair relatively short, deciding that it <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> like more of a man. When Lister and the Cat respond to a drill too slowly, Rimmer argues for increased discipline and sensible haircuts, believing that [...] "every major battle in history has been won by the side with the shortest haircuts" [...] (resulting in the Cat insulting his hair-do by saying that he has hair like his, just not on his head).|$|E

In his performances, he typically goes barefoot with wild hair and heavy eye makeup, which is juxtaposed with a crisp suit and tails, and a grand piano. According to Minchin, he likes going barefoot in his shows because it <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> more comfortable. He considers the eye makeup important because {{while he is}} playing the piano he {{is not able to}} use his arms and relies on his face for expressions and gestures; the eyeliner makes his features more distinguishable for the audience. He has said that much of his look and persona is about [...] "treading that line between mocking yourself and wanting to be an iconic figure.

2500|$|Ben confides to Sally {{that his}} life is empty. She yearns for him to hold her, but young Sally slips {{between them and the}} three move {{together}} ("Too Many Mornings"). Ben, caught in the passion of memories, kisses Sally as Buddy watches from the shadows. Sally thinks this is a sign that the two will finally get married, and Ben is about to protest until Sally interrupts him with a kiss and runs off to gather her things, thinking that the two will leave together. Buddy leaves the shadows furious, and fantasizes about the girl he should have married, Margie, who loves him and <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> like [...] "a somebody", but bitterly concludes he does not love her back ("The Right Girl"). He tells Sally that he's done, but she is lost in a fantasy world, and tells him that Ben has asked her to marry him.

Ben drunkenly propositions Carlotta, with whom he once had a fling, but she has a young lover and coolly turns him down. Heidi Schiller, joined by her younger counterpart, performs [...] "One More Kiss", her aged voice a stark contrast to the sparkling coloratura of her younger self.

Ben replies by saying that he wants a divorce, and Phyllis assumes the request is due to his love for Sally. Ben denies this, but still wants Phyllis out. Angry and hurt, Phyllis considers whether to grant his request ("Could I Leave You?").|$|E

The album was widely {{addressed}} a personal album, speaking {{about what it}} is like to be [...] "a girl like me"—things that girls Rihanna's age at the time were going through—as well as every aspect of her life: people being cheated on, falling in and out of love, people hating on you, having feelings towards a guy and partying. [...] "SOS" [...] tells about a guy who gives the girl a feeling that is very overwhelming—he drives the girl crazy, and she needs someone to rescue her from it. [...] "Kisses Don't Lie" [...] talks about a girl who's in love with a guy but is stuck between an ultimatum because she's afraid of getting hurt.
