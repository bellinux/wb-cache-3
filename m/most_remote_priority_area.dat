40|$|The Brazilian Ministry of the Environment (Ministe´ rio Do Meio Ambiente, MMA) {{proposed}} defining <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> for Brazilian biodiversity {{conservation in}} 2007, but to date, no definitions of <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> for amphibian conservation {{have been developed}} for the Caatinga biome or the semiarid region of Brazil. In this study, we searched for ‘‘hot spots’’ of amphibians in these two regions and assessed whether the <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> established by the MMA coincided with those suitable for amphibian conservation. We determined amphibian hot spots by means of three estimates: areas of endemism, areas of high species richness, and areas with species that are threatened, rare, or have very limited distributions. We then assessed the degree of coincidence between amphibian hot spots and the <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> of the MMA based on the current conservation units. We analyzed areas of endemism {{with the use of a}} parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) on quadrats. The Caatinga biome and semiarid region showed four and six areas of endemism, respectively, mainly associated with mountainous areas that are covered by isolated forests and positively correlated with species richness. All areas of endemism coincided with one or more <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> defined by the MMA. We identify 15 <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> for amphibian conservation in the Caatinga biome and semiarid region, including the creation of new full-protection conservation units...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to stratify <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> for malaria control in the State of Mato Grosso, Brazil, based on spatial analysis. The {{variables}} used were: Annual Parasite Index (API), Plasmodium falciparum/Plasmodium vivax ratio, population variation, number of families settled, and percent of deforested area. The Moran's I and Local Moran Test were applied, visualized with the Box Map and Moran Map, for 1986 - 1991, 1992 - 1997, and 1998 - 2003. Box Map identified areas with high, low, and intermediate priority for control, and Moran Map identified municipalities with significant autocorrelation. In the high <b>priority</b> <b>area,</b> located in the North of Mato Grosso, malaria incidence decreased drastically despite the increase in the number of municipalities from the first to the last period. Other municipalities were added to the lower <b>priority</b> <b>area,</b> from the Southeast, Southwest, and Central-South of the State. The intermediate <b>priority</b> <b>area</b> was located along the border with neighboring States and municipalities classified as high and low priority. Spatial analysis showed the importance of the neighboring phenomenon between municipalities in defining <b>priority</b> <b>areas,</b> thus highlighting the technique's advantages for use in malaria control and surveillance...|$|R

40|$|The {{approach}} of ecosystem services has shown promise {{for the evaluation}} of interactions between ecosystems and society, integrating environmental and socioeconomic concepts which require interdisciplinary knowledge. However, its usefulness in decision making is limited due to information gaps. This study was therefore developed in order to contribute to the application of principles of ecosystem services in the decision-making for water resources management. It aims to identify procedures and methodologies used for decision-making in order to select <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> to be included in projects or compensation programs for environmental services. To do so, we searched technical and scientific literature describing methods and experiences used to select <b>priority</b> <b>areas.</b> Key steps in the process of selecting <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> were identified; then a survey was conducted of the procedures adopted for each key step considering the literature selected; and, finally, the information collected was analyzed and classified. Considering the study’s sample, we noted that the selection of <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> was based on the direct use of predetermined criteria. The use of indicators and spatial analyses are practices still scarcely employed. We must highlight, however, that most of the analyzed documents did not aim to describe the process of selecting <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> in detail, which may have resulted in some omissions. Although these conditions may limit the analysis in this study, the results presented here allow us to identify the main objectives, actions and criteria used to select <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> for programs or compensation projects for environmental services...|$|R
40|$|Policies and {{research}} increasingly {{focus on the}} protection of ecosystem services (ESs) through priority-area conservation. <b>Priority</b> <b>areas</b> for ESs should be identified based on ES capacity and ES demand and account for the connections between areas of ES capacity and demand (flow) resulting in areas of unique demand-supply connections (flow zones). We tested ways to account for ES demand and flow zones to identify <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> in the European Union. We mapped the capacity and demand of a global (carbon sequestration), a regional (flood regulation), and 3 local ESs (air quality, pollination, and urban leisure). We used Zonation software to identify <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> for ESs based on 6 tests: with and without accounting for ES demand and 4 tests that accounted for the effect of ES flow zone. There was only 37. 1 % overlap between the 25 % of <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> that encompassed the most ESs with and without accounting for ES demand. The level of ESs maintained in the <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> increased from 23. 2 % to 57. 9 % after accounting for ES demand, especially for ESs with a small flow zone. Accounting for flow zone had a small effect on the location of <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> and level of ESs maintained but resulted in fewer flow zones without ES maintained relative to ignoring flow zones. Accounting for demand and flow zones enhanced representation and distribution of ESs with local to regional flow zones without large trade-offs relative to the global ES. We found that ignoring ES demand led to the identification of <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> in <b>remote</b> regions where benefits from ES capacity to society were small. Incorporating ESs in conservation planning should therefore always account for ES demand to identify an effective priority network for ESs...|$|R
40|$|Grasslands provide many {{ecosystem}} services required to support human well-being and {{are home to}} a diverse fauna and flora. Degradation of grasslands due to agriculture {{and other forms of}} land use threaten biodiversity and {{ecosystem services}}. Various efforts are underway around the world to stem these declines. The Grassland Programme in South Africa is one such initiative and is aimed at safeguarding both biodiversity and ecosystem services. As part of this developing programme, we identified spatial <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> for ecosystem services, tested the effect of different target levels of ecosystem services used to identify <b>priority</b> <b>areas,</b> and evaluated whether biodiversity <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> can be aligned with those for ecosystem services. We mapped five ecosystem services (below ground carbon storage, surface water supply, water flow regulation, soil accumulation and soil retention) and identified <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> for individual ecosystem services and for all five services at the scale of quaternary catchments. Planning for individual ecosystem services showed that, depending on the ecosystem service of interest, between 4 % and 13 % of the grassland biome was required to conserve at least 40 % of the soil and water services. Thirty-four percent of the biome was needed to conserve 40 % of the carbon service in the grassland. <b>Priority</b> <b>areas</b> identified for five ecosystem services under three target levels (20 %, 40 %, 60 % of the total amount) showed that between 17 % and 56 % of the grassland biome was needed to conserve these ecosystem services. There was moderate to high overlap between <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> selected for ecosystem services and already-identified terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity <b>priority</b> <b>areas.</b> This level of overlap coupled with low irreplaceability values obtained when planning for individual ecosystem services makes it possible to combine biodiversity and ecosystem services in one plan using systematic conservation planning...|$|R
