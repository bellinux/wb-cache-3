5|$|Charms {{have been}} removed; their {{functionality}} in Windows Store apps is accessed from an App commands menu on their title bar. In its place is Action Center, which displays notifications and settings toggles. It is accessed by clicking an icon in the notification area, or dragging {{from the right}} of the screen. Notifications can be synced between multiple devices. The Settings app (formerly PC Settings) was refreshed and now includes <b>more</b> <b>options</b> that were previously exclusive to the desktop Control Panel.|$|E
5|$|In May 2012, a new {{designers}} {{edition of}} Ogre was funded on Kickstarter.com. The original goal was $20,000 {{and the final}} funding was a total of $923,680. As the funding grew, more and <b>more</b> <b>options</b> and upgrades were added, with the final game weighing over 25 pounds (11kg). It began shipping to its Kickstarter supporters in October 2013, {{and is expected to}} arrive at retail stores on December 6, 2013.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to add <b>more</b> <b>options</b> for {{travelers}} in Roanoke, the airport added non-stop service to Orlando in May 2006 and Tampa in December 2006 with Allegiant Air. This is largely seen {{as the product of}} an effort by local leaders to bring new and improved service to the airport through both existing and new carriers. Earlier attempts to lobby AirTran Airways and the now defunct Independence Air to serve the airport were unsuccessful.|$|E
50|$|An option ROM should {{normally}} {{return to}} the BIOS after completing its initialization process. Once (and if) an option ROM returns, the BIOS continues searching for <b>more</b> <b>option</b> ROMs, calling each as it is found, until the entire option ROM area in the memory space has been scanned.|$|R

5|$|Later in the game's development, Chahi added laser pistols, {{including}} the one that Lester carries for several effects. The idea {{was influenced by the}} Star Wars franchise, but added depth to the gameplay by giving the player <b>more</b> <b>options.</b> He also found that repeated laser fire by the enemies helped to enunciate the rhythm of the game. Chahi would later add in the plasma ball that increased the available strategy to players. Several points in the game use elevators or teleporters to move Lester between levels; Chahi had used these instead of stairways, as it was difficult to produce proper animation for these.|$|E
5|$|Panzer Dragoon Sagas battles {{take place}} while flying on the dragon. They mix {{real-time}} and turn-based elements, with three action gauges that charge in real time. When a gauge fills, the player {{can make a}} move, such as attacking or using an item such as a shield or poison cure. Waiting for multiple gauges to charge facilitates <b>more</b> <b>options,</b> such as making multiple moves in quick succession, but this gives the enemy more opportunity to attack. The speed at which the gauges charge is governed by the dragon's agility attribute; if this {{is higher than the}} enemy's agility attribute, the player can make moves more frequently than the enemy, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{gameplay}} {{elements were}} directly taken from Far Cry 3. Exotic locations, hunting, {{and the freedom}} for players to complete missions through different approaches were maintained in Far Cry 4. The team hoped that by incorporating and expanding upon on these ideas, while introducing new features, they could make Far Cry 4 an evolution for the series. As a result, {{the size of the}} game's outposts became larger and players were given <b>more</b> <b>options</b> to customize their weapons. The team also realized that players {{spent a lot of time}} interacting with the open world of Far Cry 3, and decided to put more effort and resources into the world's design and add more quests to the game.|$|E

5|$|Strategically, the Allied {{mission was}} simple. The fleet {{needed to protect}} the flank of the army at Thermopylae, whilst not being cut off themselves. For the Persians, the {{strategic}} situation was equally simple, although with <b>more</b> <b>options.</b> They needed to force their way through either one of Thermopylae or Artemisium (since holding both was necessary for the Allied effort), or to outflank either position. Outflanking the Straits of Artemisium was theoretically much easier than outflanking Thermopylae, by sailing around {{the east coast of}} Euboea. The Greek position at Artemisium may have been chosen in order to watch for such attempts. If narrowness of the channel had been the only determinant, the Allies could have found a better position near the city of Histiaea.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} two modes, a single player story mode and a multi-player versus mode. The story mode follows the boxing careers {{of the main}} {{characters}} from the original series. All characters available to the player are from the Kamogawa Boxing Gym. Cut scenes are added in before and after matches as the main story telling device, and utilize the same character models as the fights. The game has six story arcs and begins with Makunouchi Ippo, the protagonist from the manga series. Story mode also unlocks <b>more</b> <b>options</b> in the versus mode as a player progresses through the story. Once a character has been played or a special technique learned, they become available in the versus mode. Likewise, once an opponent has been beaten, they are playable in the versus mode.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} the protagonist Leon S. Kennedy from a third-person perspective. The gameplay focuses on action and shootouts involving crowds of enemies in large open areas but still features some Horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms {{in for an}} over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms, instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up or down, players have <b>more</b> <b>options.</b> For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons, and headshots instantly kill most human enemies. Players can shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.|$|E

5|$|When using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection {{for online}} multiplayer, the player can choose between a match with a random {{opponent}} {{from around the}} world, or a match with someone that the player has exchanged friend codes with. Worldwide matches are limited to two players, with the weather conditions being randomly generated and a map randomly chosen from a set list. Worldwide match players can choose if they want an opponent close to their skill level or to play against an opponent regardless of skill level. When playing with a friend, <b>more</b> <b>options</b> are opened up to allow greater customization of the match, such as the type of weather and {{the duration of the}} match. Voice chat is only supported when playing with a friend, and is unavailable during worldwide online play. However, Caulder can not be used in ONLINE multiplayer due to his extreme advantages.|$|E
5|$|The players union {{encouraged}} {{players to}} find work overseas, hoping owners would offer better deals if they saw players having <b>more</b> <b>options.</b> Josh Childress, who played for Greek team Olympiacos {{before returning to the}} NBA in 2010, said he would not consider playing overseas during the lockout. He cited concerns with reliability of getting paid, differences in coaching styles, and lower standards of business travel compared to the NBA. The International Basketball Federation (FIBA) announced on July 29 that it would allow players under NBA contracts to play overseas, provided that the contracts they signed had opt-out clauses that allowed players to return once the work stoppage ended. Stern said the league would allow players to play overseas, but he warned that it could divide the union and possibly jeopardize players' contracts if they were seriously injured. Most leagues permitted the signing of locked-out NBA players with the option of opting out; the Chinese Basketball Association, however, only allowed its clubs to sign foreign free agents who could play for at least the entire season. Chinese nationals were exempt from this rule; this allowed Yi Jianlian to return to the NBA upon the end of the lockout.|$|E
