40|$|The {{investigation}} of spin waves in microstructured magnetic materials {{has attracted a}} lot of interest in recent research. The propagation of spin waves in simple systems like continuous Þlms or stripes is well understood [1]. Spin waves and their quanta, the magnons, are good candidates to develop magnetic logic circuits [2]. Magnonic crystals [37] and the propagation through tunnel barriers are examples for building blocks, which selectively transmit a spin-wave signal. Tunnel barriers can be realized either by magnetic barriers using a wire with an electrical current ßow [8, 9] or sim-ply by a mechanical air gap. The propagation through such a gap has recently been investigated by Kozhanov et al. in CoTaZr [10] and Schneider et al. in YIG [11]. In the work presented here the tunneling of spin waves through a <b>mechanical</b> <b>gap</b> was investi-gated in microstructured stripes made of Ni 81 Fe 19 (permalloy). To avoid direct measurements of the electromagnetic leakage the investigations were done by using the microfocus Brillouin light scattering technique [12] allowing for the {{investigation of}} the spatial distribution of tunneling spin waves in a microstripe. We present an investigation of spin waves tunneling through a <b>mechanical</b> <b>gap</b> in the MSSW geometry. The focus of this work is on the investigation of the transmission of spin waves through a tunnel barrier with respect to the position of the gap. We will show that quantization effects play an important role in the behavior of tunneled spin waves in microscaled systems. Fig. 1 : Schematic design of the sample. The three Ni 81 Fe 19 -stripes are shown. Stripe A is the reference stripe, B the stripe containing the gap and C the shortened stripe.

40|$|Cardiac Na channel {{remodeling}} {{provides a}} critical substrate for generation of reentrant arrhythmias in border zones of the infarcted canine heart. Recent {{studies show that}} Nav 1. 5 assembly and function are linked to ankyrin-G, <b>gap,</b> and <b>mechanical</b> junction proteins. In this study our objective is to expound {{the status of the}} cardiac Na channel, its interacting protein ankyrinG and the <b>mechanical</b> and <b>gap</b> junction proteins at two different times post infarction when arrhythmias are known to occur; that is, 48 hr and 5 day post coronary occlusion. Previous studies have shown the origins of arrhythmic events come from the subendocardial Purkinje and epicardial border zone. Our Purkinje cell (Pcell) voltage clamp study shows that INa and its kinetic parameters do not differ between Pcells from the subendocardium of the 48 hr infarcted heart (IZPCs) and control non-infarcted Pcells (NZPCs). Immunostaining studies revealed that disturbances of Nav 1. 5 protein location with ankyrin-G are modest in 48 hr IZPCs. Therefore, Na current remodeling does not contribute to the abnormal conduction in the subendocardial border zone 48 hr post myocardial infarction as previously defined. In addition, immunohistochemical data show that Cx 40 /Cx 43 co-localize at the intercalated disc (IDs) of control NZPCs but separate in IZPCs. At the same time, Purkinje cell desmoplakin and desmoglein 2 immunostaining become diffuse while plakophilin 2 and plakoglobin increase in abundance at IDs. In the epicardial border zone 5 days post myocardial infarction, immunoblot and immunocytochemical analyses showed that ankyrin-G protein expression is increased and re-localized to submembrane cell regions at a time when Nav 1. 5 function is decreased. Thus, Nav 1. 5 and ankyrin-G remodeling occur later after myocardial infarction compared to that of <b>gap</b> and <b>mechanical</b> junctional proteins. <b>Gap</b> and <b>mechanical</b> junctional proteins remodel in IZPCs early, perhaps to help maintain Nav 1. 5 subcellular location position and preserve its function soon after myocardial infarction...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} method for finding the {{accurate}} position of narrow gaps, intended for seam tracking applications. Laser beam welding of butt joints, with narrow gap and weld width, demand very accurate positioning to avoid serious and difficult to detect lack of fusion defects. Existing optical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>gap</b> trackers have problems with narrow gaps and surface finish. Eddy current probes can detect narrow gaps, but the accuracy is affected by mismatch in height above the surface {{on either side of}} the gap. In this paper a non-contact eddy-current method, suitable for robotic seam tracking, is proposed. The method is based on the resistive and inductive response of two absolute eddy current coils {{on either side of the}} gap to calculate a position compensated for height variations. Additionally, the method may be used to estimate the values of height and gap width, which is useful for weld parameter optimization. To investigate the response to variations in height, the method is tested on non-magnetic metals by scanning one commercially available eddy current probe across an adjustable gap and calculating the expected response for a two-probe configuration.

40|$|A novel {{chirping}} {{technique is}} applied to the design of very high-power waveguide harmonic low-pass filters. The technique could be used, for instance, to avoid multipactor testing in multicarrier systems such as the output multiplexer of a communications satellite. The novel chirped filter shows low insertion loss, all higher order mode suppression, and broad stopband rejection up to the third harmonic. This paper focuses on the maximization of the filter power-handling capability without affecting its excellent frequency behavior. Given a certain frequency response, the E-plane <b>mechanical</b> <b>gap</b> of the structure and the length (in the propagation direction) of the waveguide sections between its constituent bandstop elements can be considered to improve the high-power behavior. However, the power performance may not be sufficient yet in some applications if we wish, for instance, multipactor testing to be avoided. This becomes feasible by chirping the length (in the propagation direction) of the bandstop elements. An example for Ku band is discussed for relevant frequency specifications. An improvement from ∼ 8 kW (non-chirped filter) to more than 100 kW (chirped filter) is obtained. As a reference, the equivalent waffle-iron filter can handle only 0. 15 kW. Such high-power threshold levels have never been reported before for such kind of filters.

The mechanical loss components generated within electrical machines are well known; however, their prediction or derivation {{has not been}} widely reported in the literature. These, together with the electromagnetic loss sources and heat transfer effects, are crucial and must be accounted for when considering high-power-density, high-speed, and/or compact machine designs. This research is focused on separating the mechanical loss components to gain a more in-depth understanding of the effects and their importance. Both experimental and theoretical techniques have been employed {{in the analysis of}} a machine demonstrator. In particular, hardware tests with dummy rotors have been performed to measure the bearing and windage/drag loss components. These have been supplemented with computational fluid dynamics analysis to theoretically evaluate the aerodynamic effects occurring within the <b>mechanical</b> air <b>gap</b> accounting for loss and heat transfer. It has been identified that the analyzed hardware demonstrator suffered bearing loss significantly higher than that suggested by the bearing manufacturer. This has been attributed to design of the mechanical assembly accommodating bearings, which resulted in inappropriate bearing preload. The excessive bearing loss had a significant detrimental effect on the machine thermal behavior. In contrast, the aerodynamic effects have been found to have less pronounced effects here, due to fully enclosed and naturally cooled machine construction...|$|R

40|$|Membrane {{potential}} {{responses in}} the rat isolated anococcygeus to bath-applied noradrenaline and field stimulation have been investigated by use of intracellular microelectrode and combined extracellular electrical and <b>mechanical</b> (sucrose <b>gap)</b> recording techniques. Intracellular recordings were made usually from tissues immobilized with hypertonic Krebs solution. Bath-application of noradrenaline produced depolarizations which consisted of two components; an initial 'fast' phase which peaked within 1 - 2 s and which {{was followed by a}} 'slow' sustained depolarization. Both components were concentration-dependent. Noradrenaline could also evoke oscillations in membrane potential which, unlike the 'fast' component of depolarization, were prevented by conditioning hyperpolarization of the membrane and were evoked by direct membrane depolarization with externally applied current pulses. Thus, the oscillations are voltage-dependent phenomena. Replacement of the external NaCl of the Krebs solution with an equimolar amount of Na benzenesulphonate abolished the noradrenaline-evoked 'fast' depolarization while the 'slow' phase was unaffected. This suggests that two mechanisms of depolarization are activated in this muscle by the bath-application of noradrenaline. The adrenergic excitatory junction potential was also abolished in Na benzenesulphonate. Prazosin reduced both the 'fast' and 'slow' components of depolarization produced by noradrenaline indicating their mediation by alpha 1 -adrenoceptors. The membrane potential (- 29 mV) at the maximum amplitude of the 'fast' depolarization was similar to the equilibrium potential (- 27 mV) for the depolarization evoked by ionophoretically applied noradrenaline and which was obtained by extrapolation from the relationship between amplitude of the ionophoretic response and membrane potential displacement in the partition chamber. These results suggest that the 'fast' depolarization and the ionophoretic response are due to an increased membrane conductance, possibly to chloride...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Desmosomes and adherens {{junctions}} provide mechanical {{continuity between}} cardiac cells, whereas gap junctions allow for cell-cell electrical/metabolic coupling. These structures reside at the cardiac intercalated disc (ID). Also at the ID is the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) complex. Functional interactions between desmosomes, gap junctions, and VGSC have been demonstrated. Separate studies show, under various conditions, reduced presence of gap junctions at the ID and redistribution of connexin 43 (Cx 43) to plaques oriented parallel to fiber direction (gap junction 2 ̆ 2 lateralization 2 ̆ 2). OBJECTIVE: To determine {{the mechanisms of}} Cx 43 lateralization, {{and the fate of}} desmosomal and sodium channel molecules in the setting of Cx 43 remodeling. METHODS: Adult sheep were subjected to right ventricular pressure overload (pulmonary hypertension). Tissue was analyzed by quantitative confocal microscopy and by transmission electron microscopy. Ionic currents were measured using conventional patch clamp. RESULT: Quantitative confocal microscopy demonstrated lateralization of immunoreactive junctional molecules. Desmosomes and gap junctions in lateral membranes were demonstrable by electron microscopy. Cx 43 /desmosomal remodeling was accompanied by lateralization of 2 microtubule-associated proteins relevant for Cx 43 trafficking: EB 1 and kinesin protein Kif 5 b. In contrast, molecules of the VGSC failed to reorganize in plaques discernable by confocal microscopy. Patch-clamp studies demonstrated change in amplitude and kinetics of sodium current and a small reduction in electrical coupling between cells. CONCLUSIONS: Cx 43 lateralization is part of a complex remodeling that includes <b>mechanical</b> and <b>gap</b> junctions but may exclude components of the VGSC. We speculate that lateralization results from redirectionality of microtubule-mediated forward trafficking.

40|$|Where {{the complex}} form shapes of work pieces require five-axes {{machining}} in highest precision, the machine {{systems that are}} available on the market, are often limited in their accuracy (spatial positioning accuracy < 10 mym). In previous enquiries, the five-axes machining accuracy was identified as limiting factor for the high precision manufacturing of complex micro parts for high end applications. Especially the rotary axes of conventional five-axes machine design affect the machine accuracy significantly. For this reason the Fraunhofer IPT initiated a research project focusing on the reduction of the rotational axis error by implementing an integral design strategy consequently. A concept has been developed integrating hydrostatic bearings into a torque motor. Therefore electrotechnical as well as mechanical issues have been worked out following the integral resolution method for increasing the five-axes accuracy. Focusing on the reduction of the error activating cantilevers caused by the rotary axes, a concept has been worked out integrating hydrostatic bearings into a torque motor. Thereby, a radial bearing is integrated into the air gap of the torque motor while two axial bearings are positioned in-between the work piece table and the face side of the motor. Following the integral design idea principally, the bearing pockets are integrated into the primary part of the drive and the counter bearing surfaces are provided by the work piece table, the motor's face side and the circumference of the rotor. The integration of the radial hydrostatic bearing changes the electro-magnetical, the mechanical as well as the thermal conditions of the torque motor although the bearing behaviour will be affected by the <b>mechanical</b> stiffness (<b>gap</b> variation) and by the temperature (gap variation and oil viscosity) of the torque motor...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of rusted and <b>mechanical</b> damaged flame <b>gaps,</b> {{and the ability of}} these flame gaps to prevent a hydrogen gas explosion transmission between an inner and outer explosion chamber. An explosion chamber intended for preventing such an explosion transmission between an inner and outer explosive atmosphere is called an Ex'd' enclosure. In the industry there are many potential ignition sources that could be a threat in an explosive atmosphere, as an explosion may occur if being ignited. Ex'd' enclosures are designed to surround the potential ignition sources and to protect a possible internal explosion from spreading to the outer environment. Ex'd' enclosures have certain design requirements specified in the international standards IEC. The design criteria that was examined in this work is (IEC 2007 a) 's requirement which states that the mean surface roughness of the flame gap opening shall be less than 6. 3 μm. The international standards also require that any damaged flame gap surface must be restored to the original state. However, the standards have no definition of what damages are considerable large enough for having to be restored to the original quality. As a result of this lack of guidance, even minor rust or mechanical damage of the flame gap surfaces must be repaired, which is a time consuming and expensive procedure. The purpose of the present research is, {{due to the lack of}} damage ranking definition, to examine what effect different damages have on the safe gap. To be able to conclude about the importance and effect of the damage, one must have a characteristic value for each slit to compare the results. The characteristic value used in this work is the maximum experimental safe gap, MESG, which is a measure of the largest gap opening that does not generate a re- ignition on the outside of the Ex'd' enclosure. An increase in MESG value does therefore imply an increased efficiency of the safe gap. The MESG value is individual for each explosive gas, and will vary as the surfaces of the flame gaps are changed. Similar experiments have previously been performed with propane as the explosive gas, but the present work is carried out with hydrogen as the explosive gas. The present work has also considered the effect of different time periods of rust formation. Six slits were set at sea side for one month and six others for two months. Rusted slits shall, according to the stardards, be restored to the initial state. But results show that corrosion actually increases the efficiency of the safe gap. The efficiency of the safe gap also increases with increased rust formation on the slit's surfaces. The <b>mechanical</b> damaged flame <b>gaps</b> were applied grooves of various depths and various widths to their surfaces. All grooves were crosswise, thus in the opposite direction of the gas flow that was being pushed through the opening by the internal explosion. The MESG values of the mechanical damaged slits turned out to be larger than the undamaged slits' MESG values, which refers to an increased efficiency of the safe gap. The overall conclusion from this investigation is that damaged surfaces of flame gaps do not reduce the efficiency of the safe gap. Neither rusted nor significant <b>mechanical</b> damaged flame <b>gap</b> surfaces reduce the efficiency of the safe gap. In fact, improvements are observed in all cases. This indicates that the surface roughness requirements of the international standards which states that the mean surface roughness must be less than 6. 3 μm, is an arbitrarily chosen value. It is also shown in this study that the temperature of the hot combustion gases is lower after they have penetrated through flame gaps with grooves, rather than after penetrating through an undamaged flame gap. The probability of generating a re-ignition in the secondary chamber through flame gaps with grooves is then decreased as a result of the lower temperatur...|$|R

Whereas disturbed flow in the branches and curved regions of large arteries is proatherogenic, laminar flow in the straight parts of vessels is atheroprotective. In addition, hypertension and age-related changes in arterial stiffness are important risk factors of the disease. Hemodynamic forces induce various changes in the structure and function of vascular endothelium, many of which reflect alterations in gene expression. Endothelial cells are linked by gap junctions, which facilitate the propagation of electrical and chemical signals along the vascular wall. Using an in vitro perfusion system, we investigated the effects of pulsed unidirectional and oscillatory flows in combination with different levels of hydrostatic pressure and circumferential stretch on the expression of Cx 43 in endothelial cells. Our results show that shear stress and circumferential stretch, but not pressure, modulate the expression of Cx 43.

These structures reside at the cardiac intercalated disc (ID). Also at the ID is the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) complex. Functional interactions between desmosomes, gap junctions, and VGSCs have been demonstrated. Separate studies show, under various conditions, decreased abundance of gap junctions at the ID, and redistribution of connexin 43 (Cx 43) to plaques oriented parallel to fiber direction (gap junction “lateralization”). The mechanisms of Cx 43 lateralization, and {{the fate of}} desmosomal and VGSC molecules in the setting of Cx 43 remodeling, remain understudied. To study remodeling we employed the sheep pulmonary hypertension model. We found that Cx 43 lateralization is a part of a complex remodeling that includes <b>mechanical</b> and <b>gap</b> junctions, but may exclude components of VGSC. Cx 43 /desmosomal remodeling was accompanied by lateralization of two microtubule-associated proteins relevant for Cx 43 trafficking: EB 1 and the kinesin protein Kif 5 b. Thus, we speculate that lateralization results from redirectionality of microtubule-mediated forward trafficking. Remodeling of junctional complexes may preserve electrical synchrony under conditions that disrupt ID integrity. We then further focused on the importance of the expression of Cx 43 and desmosomal protein, PKP 2, on the function of VGSCs in the heart. Studies of PKP 2 and Cx 43 deficiency (PKP 2 +/- and Cx 43 -/-) mice models demonstrated that these proteins affect the distribution and function of VGSC. In an attempt to reveal the mechanism for Cx 43 -mediated regulation of VGSCs we analyzed the ability of Cx 43 to stabilize tubulin and for the plus-end of the microtubules to reach its anchoring point at sites rich in the adherens junction protein N-cadherin. Using Cx 43 null mice and the immortal cell line of cardiac origin (HL- 1) we were able to show that, in the heart, connexin 43 regulates the function of VGSCs via its tubulin binding domain. Overall, the data presented in this thesis further illustrate the intimate functional interactions of the proteins residing at the ID and reinforces the idea of these proteins working together as parts of macromolecular complexes...|$|R
40|$|Some <b>mechanical</b> {{systems with}} <b>gaps</b> {{such as in}} disc brakes and Cardan joints exhibit {{nonlinearity}} under certain load conditions, which is unpredictable and highly sensitive to initial conditions. Previous studies were mainly focused on either a single-degree-of-freedom (DOF) system or a flexible beam with uniform elastic foundation. The analysis of this thesis {{is a combination of}} these two where gaps are first introduced to a flexible beam model. A model of a beam resting on compliant foundation with gaps has been developed and analyzed. The assumed modes method is used to derive the equations of motion (EOM 2 ̆ 7 s) for the system. The responses of both rigid and flexible beam systems with linear piecewise contact vibration is considered. For the rigid beam system with only transverse DOF, the piecewise linear function method and non-dimension analysis are used to determine the solution. For the multi-DOF system, the EOM 2 ̆ 7 s are solved by numerical time integration. The pseudo-arc continuation and Floquet multipliers provide the completed frequency response along with relevant stability information. The primary resonance has been analyzed in different parameters. Several types of bifurcations are observed around the resonant frequency, some leading to chaotic motion within a small range of excitation frequencies. For the parametric analysis, the effect of gaps, excitation force, constraint load, damping and number of springs on the response are discussed, which are used to describe the types of nonlinear response (softening/hardening or both) shown on the resonant peaks. ...|$|R
40|$|Gap {{junction}} {{communication is}} an essential component in the mechanosensitive response of tenocytes. However, {{little is known about}} direct mechanoregulation of gap junction turnover and permeability. The present study tests the hypothesis that <b>mechanical</b> loading alters <b>gap</b> junction communication between tenocyte within tendon fascicles. Viable tenocytes within rat tail tendon fasicles were labelled with calcein-AM and subjected to a fluorescent loss induced by photobleaching (FLIP) protocol. A designated target cell within a row of tenocytes was continuously photobleached at 100 % laser power whilst recording the fluorescent intensity of neighbouring cells. A mathematical compartment model was developed to estimate the intercellular communication between tenocytes based upon the experimental FLIP data. This produced a permeability parameter, k, which quantifies the degree of functioning gap functions between cells as confirmed by the complete inhibition of FLIP by the inhibitor 18 ?-glycyrrhentic acid. The application of 1 N static tensile load for 10 min had no effect on gap junction communication. However, when loading was increased to 1 h, there was a statistically significant reduction in gap junction permeability. This coincided with suppression of connexin 43 protein expression in loaded samples as determined by confocal immunofluorescence. However, there was an upregulation of connexin 43 mRNA. These findings demonstrate that tenocytes remodel their gap junctions in response to alterations in mechanical loading with a complex mechanosensitive mechanism of breakdown and remodelling. This is therefore the first study to show that tenocyte gap junctions are not only important in transmitting mechanically activated signals but that mechanical loading directly regulates gap junction permeability...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMechanical forces provide {{fundamental}} physiological stimulus {{in living}} organisms. Recent investigations demonstrated how {{various types of}} mechanical load, like strain, pressure, shear stress, or cyclic stretch can affect cell biology and gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC). Depending on the cell type, the type of mechanical load and on strength and duration of application, these forces can induce hypertrophic processes and modulate the expression and function of certain connexins such as Cx 43, while others such as Cx 37 or Cx 40 are reported to be less mechanosensitive. In particular, not only expression but also subcellular localization of Cx 43 is altered in cardiomyocytes submitted to cyclic mechanical stretch resulting in the typical elongated cell shape with an accentuation of Cx 43 at the cell poles. In the heart both cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts can alter their GJIC in response to mechanical load. In the vasculature both endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells are subject to strain and cyclic stretch resulting from the pulsatile flow. In addition, vascular endothelial cells are mainly affected by shear stress resulting from the blood flow parallel to their surface. These mechanical forces lead to a regulation of GJIC in vascular tissue. In bones, osteocytes and osteoblasts are coupled via gap junctions, which also react to <b>mechanical</b> forces. Since <b>gap</b> junctions are involved in regulation of cell growth and differentiation, the mechanosensitivity of the regulation of these channels might open new perspectives to explain how cells can respond to mechanical load, and how stretch induces self-organization of a cell layer which might have implications for embryology {{and the development of}} organs.

40|$|Rationale: Plakophilin- 2 (PKP 2) is an {{essential}} component of the cardiac desmosome. Recent data show that it interacts with other molecules of the intercalated disc. Separate studies show preferential localization of the voltage-gated sodium channel (NaV 1. 5) to this region. Objective: To establish the association of PKP 2 with sodium channels and its role on action potential propagation. Methods and Results: Biochemical, patch clamp, and optical mapping experiments demonstrate that PKP 2 associates with NaV 1. 5, and that knockdown of PKP 2 expression alters the properties of the sodium current, and the velocity of action potential propagation in cultured cardiomyocytes. Conclusions: These results emphasize the importance of intermolecular interactions between proteins relevant to mechanical junctions, and those involved in electric synchrony. Possible relevance to the pathogenesis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is discussed. (Circ Res. 2009; 105 : 523 - 526.) Key Words: plakophilin- 2 intercalated disc arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy cardiac desmosomes A high-resolution image of the site of end–end contactbetween cardiomyocytes reveals an electron-dense or-ganization called “the intercalated disc. ” Its classic definition involves 3 structures: desmosomes and adherens junctions, providing <b>mechanical</b> coupling; and <b>gap</b> junctions, allowing electric/metabolic synchronization between cells. Recent studies show that other molecules, not directly involved in intercellular coupling, also reside preferentially at the inter-calated disc. Among them is NaV 1. 5, the major subunit of the cardiac sodium channel. 1 Here, we ask whether Nav 1. 5 and the desmosomal protein plakophilin- 2 (PKP 2) coexist in the same molecular complex and whether loss of PKP 2 expression affects (1) the amplitude and kinetics of the sodium current and (2) action potential propagation in a monolayer of cardiomyocytes. Our data demonstrate a func-tional crosstalk between a protein defined in the context of intercellular junctions (PKP 2) and another protein that is fundamental to the electrical behavior of the single myocyte...|$|R
40|$|Evaluate the biomechanical {{behavior}} of four variants of the transosseous-equivalent/suture bridge (TOE/SB) repair. Four suture bridge (SB) constructs were created using 24 sheep infraspinatus tendon-humerus constructs (n = 6 per technique). The groups were (1) Knotted Standard Suture Bridge (Standard SB) -suture bridge with two medial mattress stitches, (2) Knotted Double Suture Bridge (Double SB) -four medial mattress stitches, (3) Untied Suture Bridge with Medial FT Anchors (Untied SB with FT) -two medial mattress stitches without knots, and (4) Untied Suture Bridge with PushLocks (Untied SB with Pushlocks) -two medial mattress stitches without knots. The contact area footprint {{was measured with}} an electronic pressure film prior to dynamic <b>mechanical</b> testing for <b>gapping</b> and testing to failure. The Double SB produced the greatest contact area footprint {{compared to the other}} techniques, which did not differ. The Double SB repair with a mean failure load of 456. 9 N was significantly stronger than the Untied SB with Pushlocks repair at 300 N (P = 0. 023), the standard SB repair at 295 N (P = 0. 019), and lastly the Untied SB with FT repair at 284 N (P = 0. 011). No differences were detected between the two mattress stitch standard SB repair with knots and the knotless two mattress stitch repairs (Untied SB with FT and Untied SB with Pushlocks). Gaps developed during cyclic loading in all repairs apart from the Double SB repair. The transosseous-equivalent/suture bridge repair with 4 stitches tied in the medial row and maximal lateral suture strand utilization (Double SB) outperformed all other repairs in terms of failure load, tendon-bone contact, and gapping characteristics. The presence of knots in the medial row did not change tendon fixation with respect to failure load, contact area or gapping characteristics. 6 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Inside {{the second}} {{experimental}} {{wave energy converter}} (WEC) launched at the Lysekil research site on the Swedish west coast in March 2009 a number of sensor systems were installed for measuring the mechanical performance of the WEC and its mechanical subsystems. One of the measurement systems was a set-up of 7 laser triangulation sensors for measuring relative displacement of the piston rod mechanical lead-through transmission in the direct drive. Two measurement periods, separated by 2. 5 month, are presented in this paper. One measurement is made two weeks after launch and another 3 months after launch. Comparisons and correlations are made between different sensors measuring simultaneously. Noise levels are investigated. Filtering is discussed for further refinement of the laser triangulation sensor signals in order to separate noise from actual physical displacement and vibration. Measurements are presented from {{the relative displacement of}} the piston rod mechanical lead-through, from magnetic flux in the air <b>gap,</b> <b>mechanical</b> strain in the WEC structure, translator position and piston rod axial displacement and active AC power. Investigation into the measurements in the time domain with close-ups, in the frequency domain with Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and with time-frequency analysis with short time Fourier transform (STFT) is carried out to map the spectral content in the measurements. End stop impact is clearly visible in the time-frequency analysis. The FFT magnitude spectra are investigated for identifying the cogging bandwidth among other vibrations. Generator cogging, fluctuations in the damping force and in the Lorenz forces in the stator are distinguished and varies depending on translator speed. Vibrations from cogging seem to be present in the early measurement period while not so prominent in the late measurement period. Vibration frequencies due to wear are recognized by comparing with the noise at generator standstill and the vibration sources in the generator. It is concluded that a moving average is a sufficient filter in the time domain for further analysis of the relative displacement of the piston rod mechanical lead-through transmission. </p...|$|R
