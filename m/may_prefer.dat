5|$|More or {{less the}} Scottish answer to American bands like Interpol and the Strokes, Franz Ferdinand, with their du-jour cool and deft {{combination}} of insular art flair and dance-floor populism, was hailed by British hype machine New Musical Express as {{the dawn of a}} new rock revolution. The band's blue-blazered appeal, however, started to slip after 2009's overly serious concept album Tonight: Franz Ferdinand. Four years later, the zeitgeist <b>may</b> <b>prefer</b> its rock stars with suspenders and banjos, but Franz Ferdinand's Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action is an unapologetically swaggering disco-rock album that refuses to overstay its welcome.|$|E
5|$|Otters <b>may</b> <b>prefer</b> {{to feed on}} crustaceans, {{especially}} crayfish (Cambarus, Pacifasticus, and others) {{more than}} fish where they are locally and seasonally plentiful. In Georgia, crayfish accounted for two-thirds of the prey in the summer diet, and their remnants were present in 98% of the summer spraint. In the winter, crayfish made up one-third of the otter's diet. A study conducted on North American river otters in a southwestern Arkansas swamp identified a correlation between crayfish consumption, fish consumption, and water levels.|$|E

5|$|In a {{study of}} risk taking, some types of risk, such as {{physical}} or heroic risk for others' benefit, are viewed more favorably than other types of risk, such as taking drugs. Males and females valued different degrees of heroic risk for mates and same-sex friends. Males valued heroic risk taking by male friends, but preferred less of it in female mates. Females valued heroic risk taking in male mates and less of it in female friends. Females may be attracted to males inclined to physically defend them and their children. Males <b>may</b> <b>prefer</b> heroic risk taking by male friends {{as they could be}} good allies.|$|E
5|$|Instructional {{literature}} uses standard tuning. Traditionally {{a course}} {{begins with the}} hand in first position, that is, with the left-hand covering frets 1–4. Beginning players first learn open chords belonging to the major keys C,G, andD. Guitarists who play mainly open chords in these three major-keys and their relative minor-keys (Am,Em,Bm) <b>may</b> <b>prefer</b> standard tuning over an M3tuning. In particular, hobbyists playing folkmusic around a campfire are well served by standard tuning. Such hobbyists may also play major-thirds tuning, which also has many open chords with notes on five or six strings; chords with five-six strings have greater volume than chords with three-four strings and so are useful for acoustic guitars (for example, acoustic-electric guitars without amplification).|$|E
5|$|People {{living in}} areas with high rates of HIV/AIDS face several {{psychological}} barriers when deciding whether to undergo testing for HIV. For example, people <b>may</b> <b>prefer</b> not {{to know if they}} are HIV-positive because, due to the obstacles they often face in gaining access to antiretroviral drugs, many view HIV/AIDS diagnoses as death sentences. Others may simply believe that they are HIV-negative, either because they practice strict monogamy and consistently use condoms during sexual intercourse or because they are in denial about the prevalence of the disease. However, despite these barriers, both mobile and static testing services have become more widely available in Malawi recently: 1,392 testing and counseling sites existed in 2011. Certain non-governmental organization such as the Malawi AIDS Counseling and Resource Organisation (MACRO) provide door-to-door counseling and testing services, which have drastically improved the accessibility of HIV testing.|$|E
