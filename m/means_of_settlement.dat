50|$|During the mid-1990s, the {{percentages}} {{of male and female}} defectors were relatively balanced. In early to mid-1990s, male labour was valuable since North Korean defectors could work in Chinese countrysides and factories and secure hideout in return. However, due to rising social security issues including crime and violence involving North Koreans, the value of male labour decreased. Females, on the other hand, were able to find easier <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> including performing smaller labour tasks and getting married to Chinese locals. As of today, 80-90% of North Korean defectors residing in China are females who settled through de facto marriage; a large number of them experience forced marriage and human trafficking.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{questions}} {{the nature of}} money through the analysis of {{a complex set of}} local monetary systems located in Argentina (trueque). It is based on both the reconstitution {{of the history of the}} main national trueque networks (meso-level) and the observation of the monetary and financial practices of their participants, carried out through an ethnographic field work (micro-level). These data suggest that money must be understood as a system of evaluation and settlement of debts. Such approach allows first to distinguish financial from monetary practices and to clarify their interdependences. Second, it puts the emphasis on the wide diversity of monetary practices (i. e. the material media of the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> and evaluation of debts) and modalities of issuing the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlement.</b> Therefore, money can participate to the reproduction of special organizations more or less centralized and to widely contrasted social relations (either violent or emancipating).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze and clarify the process of {{formation}} and change in the institutions and customs of international airfreight. I categorize the institutions and customs for moving goods, money and documents into functional institutions and customs. Rights and obligations flow together with merchandise, foreign exchanges and documents. There are institutions and customs to govern these flows which are known as the coordinating institutions and customs. Formation of and changes to institutions and customs begin from functional ones. A coordinating institution or custom adjusts to the formation of or change in a functional institution or custom. This formation or change causes chain reactions but does not necessarily continue until the system becomes perfect. Some coordinating institutions and customs tend to remain half-finished.

40|$|F wE define {{semantics}} as {{the study}} {{of the ways in which}} human beings interact through the use of linguistic and other symbols, our first task is to distinguish between the kinds of interaction that result from linguistic processes. To start out with an extremely broad distinction, there are those linguistic processes that result in human cooperation, and there are those that result in conflict. As the result of some kinds of verbal interchange, friendships are created, affections or loyalties are nourished, social order is created, and there is established, through the long and patient refinement of linguistic means, that precise coordi-nation of human effort required in all socialized human activity: government, science, industry, and commerce. However, in certain other kinds of verbal inter-change, such as in misunderstandings, name-calling, bickering, quarreling, and doctrinal disputes, the result, if the interchange continues long enough, is the cessation of linguistic processes altogether, and there is resort to non-linguistic <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlement,</b> such as fisticuffs, riots, lockouts, strikes, wars.
