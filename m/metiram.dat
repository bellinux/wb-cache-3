Samples of V. inaequalis conidia were collected from nine orchards in 1998 and six orchards in 1999 and tested for sensitivity. Samples were plated on water agar amended with <b>metiram</b> or mancozeb. Mean EC 50 values (effective concentration of fungicide required to inhibit germination of half the conidia) for each population were calculated. The mean EC 50 values for <b>metiram</b> ranged from 0. 26 - 1. 20 ^ig <b>metiram</b> a. i. /ml, with differences (Student Newman Keul's Test (SNK), a= 0. 05) between populations. EC 50 values for mancozeb ranged from 0. 06 - 0. 58 which were also different (SNK, a= 0. 05). Five of these populations were examined for mycelial growth sensitivity to <b>metiram</b> by testing 30 monoconidial isolates from each population on <b>metiram</b> amended potato dextrose agar. Mean EC 50 values for populations were calculated and ranged from 3. 44 - 5. 94 |ig metiram/ml, and showed differences (Friedman Test, a= 0. 05).

40|$|Três experimentos foram conduzidos utilizando-se o híbrido de tomateiro {{industrial}} H 7155 N, em 2003 e 2004 visando adequar um sistema de previsão modificado para o uso de fungicidas no manejo da requeima causada por Phytophthora infestans. Os experimentos foram conduzidos num delineamento em blocos ao acaso com dez tratamentos e três repetições. Os fungicidas sistêmicos foram aplicados quando o valor de severidade da doença (VSD) alcançou oito, dez ou doze pontos. A alternância dos fungicidas sistêmicos com o <b>metiram</b> ocorreu na semana em que não foram alcançados os VSD´s. O tratamento calendário de pulverização para o controle da requeima consistiu da aplicação semanal de fungicidas após o aparecimento dos primeiros sintomas e aqueles definidos pelo sistema de previsão foram baseados nos VSD acumulados durante o experimento. A avaliação da requeima foi feita semanalmente com auxílio de uma escala descritiva de severidade e uma chave diagramática. A eficiência dos tratamentos foi comparada calculando-se a área abaixo da curva do progresso da doença, a taxa de progresso da doença (r) e produtividade de tomate. Os valores de r do melhor tratamento (dimetomorfe misturado com clorotalonil (VSD = 10) alternado com <b>metiram</b> variaram de 0, 03 a 0, 07, enquanto para o tratamento calendário semanal foi de 0, 05 a 0, 09 e para testemunha de 0, 24 a 0, 39. Dimetomorfe + clorotalonil (VSD = 10) alternado com <b>metiram</b> produziu em média 15, 7 toneladas a mais de tomate, comparado ao tratamento calendário semanal de fungicidas. Dimetomorfe ou metalaxil-M misturado com clorotalonil (VSD = 10) baseado no sistema de previsão sem a alternância com <b>metiram</b> diferiu do calendário semanal baseado na severidade da doença e na produção de tomate. Os tratamentos piraclostrobina misturado com <b>metiram</b> (VSD = 8; VSD = 10) alternado com metiram; dimetomorfe misturado com mancozeb (VSD = 8; VSD = 10) alternado com <b>metiram</b> proporcionaram controle intermediário da requeima. O sistema de previsão baseado no uso de dimetomorfe misturado com clorotalonil alternado com <b>metiram</b> (VSD = 10) permitiu redução de uma aplicação da mistura dimetomorfe misturado com clorotalonil pulverização em dois dos três experimentos, comparados ao tratamento calendário semanal de aplicação de fungicidas, sem afetar a produção. Three {{experiments were}} carried out using an industrial tomato hybrid H 7155 N crop, in 2003 and 2004 seasons to fit a modified prediction system, which allows the criterious use of fungicides for the control of late blight caused by Phytophthora infestans. Trials were conducted in a randomized complete block design with ten treatments and three replications. The formulated systemic fungicides were applied when the disease severity values (DSV) reached eight, ten or twelve points. On weeks where DSV's values were lower than eight, ten or twelve, <b>metiram</b> was applied. The traditional late blight control consisted of weekly application of fungicides after the first symptoms disease, and those defined by the prediction system {{were carried out}} based on the DSV's accumulated throughout the experiment. Late blight severity was assessed weekly by using a descriptive key and diagrammatic scale. The efficiency of the control treatments was compared by the area under the disease progress curve, disease progress rate (r) and tomato yield. The r values of the best treatment (dimethomorph + chlorothalonil, DSV = 10, alternated with <b>metiram),</b> weekly application calendar fungicides and the check treatment varied from 0. 03 to 0. 07, 0. 05 to 0. 09 and 0. 24 to 0. 39, respectively. Dimethomorph + chlorothalonil DSV = 10 alternated with <b>metiram</b> was the most efficient and yielded more than 15, 7 ton of tomato in average, above the weekly spraying calendar fungicides. Dimethomorph or metalaxyl-M mixtured with chlorothalonil (DSV = 10) based on the prediction scheme without alternation with <b>metiram</b> differed from the weekly spraying calendar fungicide based on disease severity and tomato yield. The treatments pyraclostrobim + <b>metiram</b> (DSV = 8; DSV = 10) alternated with metiram; dimethomorph + mancozeb (DSV = 8; DSV = 10) alternated with <b>metiram</b> gave intermediate control of late blight and tomato yield. The prediction scheme that used dimethomorph + chlorothalonil alternated with <b>metiram</b> (DSV = 10) allowed the reduction in one spray in two trials of the mixture dimethomorph + chlorothalonil compared to the weekly spraying calendar fungicide without any yield loss...|$|E

The efficacy of pyraclostrobine, <b>metiram,</b> and pyraclostrobine+metiram as spore germination inhibitors was confirmed against “B”. parva and “B”. obtusa, being pyraclostrobine+metiram the best fungicide tested (lowest EC 50 values). The potential use of such fungicides to control the Botryosphaeriaceae diseases {{in the field is}} promising, as often in the same vine different Botryosphaeriaceae species are present. This would also allow the alternation of products to avoid resistance risks...|$|E
40|$|The {{bacterial}} spot of tomato, caused by Xanthomonas spp., {{is a very}} important disease, especially in the hot and humid periods of the year. The chemical control of the disease has not been very effective for a number of reasons. This study aimed to evaluate, under greenhouse conditions, the efficacy of leaf-spraying chemicals (acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) (0. 025 g. L − 1), fluazinam (0. 25 g. L − 1), pyraclostrobin (0. 08 g. L − 1), pyraclostrobin + methiran (0. 02 g. L − 1 + 2. 2 g. L − 1), copper oxychloride (1. 50 g. L − 1), mancozeb + copper oxychloride (0. 88 g. L − 1 + 0. 60 g. L − 1), and oxytetracycline (0. 40 g. L − 1)) on control of {{bacterial spot}}. Tomatoes Santa Clara and Gisele cultivars were pulverized 3 days before inoculation with Xanthomonas perforans. The production of enzymes associated with resistance induction (peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, β- 1, 3 -glucanase, and protease) was quantified from leaf samples collected 24 hours before and 24 hours after chemical spraying and at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 days after bacterial inoculation. All products tested controlled bacterial spot, but only ASM, pyraclostrobin, and pyraclostrobin + <b>metiram</b> increased the production of peroxidase in the leaves of the two tomato cultivars, and increased the production of polyphenol oxidase and β- 1, 3 -glucanase in the Santa Clara cultivar. </p...|$|E
40|$|Previous surveys {{conducted}} in commercial nurseries found that different wood fungi, namely Cylindrocarpon spp., Botryosphaeriaceae, Phomopsis viticola and Phaeomoniella chlamydospora infect grapevine cuttings. Two fi eld trials {{were carried out}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of cyprodinil + fl udioxonil, pyraclostrobin + <b>metiram,</b> fl udioxonil and cyprodinil to prevent or reduce natural infections caused by such fungi. Rootstock and scion cuttings were soaked in fungicidal suspensions for 50 min prior to grafting. After callusing, the grafted cuttings were planted in two commercial fi eld nurseries with and without a previous history of grapevine cultivation. After nine months in the nursery, the plants were uprooted and analysed for the incidence and severity of the wood fungi. Plants uprooted from the fi eld without a previous history of grapevine cultivation were generally less strongly infected by wood fungi. Under this condition, only the mixture cyprodinil + fl udioxonil simultaneously reduced the incidence of Cylindrocarpon and Botryosphaeriaceae fungi, as well as the severity of Cylindrocarpon infections. Treatments did not produce signifi cant differences in the incidence and severity of P. viticola, and Pa. chlamydospora. For plants grown in the fi eld with a grapevine history, all fungicides except cyprodinil signifi cantly reduced the incidence and severity of Cylindrocarpon fungi. Also, the incidence and severity of Botryosphaeriaceae pathogens were signifi cantly decreased both by cyprodinil + fl udioxonil and by cyprodinil. No signifi cant differences were noticed for P. viticola incidence and severity, and Pa. chlamydospora was not detected again. These results suggest that the practice of soaking grapevine cuttings in selected fungicides prior to grafting signifi cantly reduces Cylindrocarpon spp. and Botryosphaeriaceae infections, thus improving the quality of planting material...|$|E

Nos testes in vitro os fungicidas foram solubilizados em meio BDA, utilizando-se as concentrações de 0, 1, 1, 10 e 100 mg L- 1 de ingrediente ativo. A fungitoxidade dos produtos foi avaliada por meio da ED 50 (dose necessária para inibir 50 % da germinação conidial ou crescimento micelial). Em casa de vegetação, estimou-se a severidade da mancha-de-mirotécio pela porcentagem de área foliar lesionada nas plantas de algodoeiro tratadas antes (preventivo) e depois (curativo) da inoculação do patógeno. Os fungicidas tiofanato metílico, carbendazim, metconazol, tiofanato metílico + clorotalonil, piraclostrobina + epoxiconazol, piraclostrobina + <b>metiram,</b> triflostrobina + propiconazol e tebuconazol inibiram com alta eficácia (ED 50 The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the toxicity of benzimidazoles, triazoles, strobilurins, isoftalonitrils and ditiocarbamats on Myrothecium roridum conidial germination and micelial growth in vitro, and the myrothecium leaf spot severity on cotton plants. On in vitro tests, fungicides were solubilized in PDA media at the following concentrations: 0. 1, 1, 10 and 100 mg L- 1. The toxicity of the products were evaluated by the ED 50 rate (required for inhibiting 50 % of the conidial germination or mycelial growth). In greenhouse tests, the severity of myrothecium leaf spot was quantified by measuring the leaf area affected by the pathogen in cotton plants sprayed before (preventive) and after (curative) the pathogen inoculation. The fungicides thiophanate methyl, carbendazim, metconazole, thiophanate methyl + chlorothalonil, pyraclostrobin + epoxyconazole, pyraclostrobin + metiran, trifloxystrobin + propiconazole, and tebuconazole were highly efficient (ED 50 < 1 mg L- 1) or efficient (ED 50 between 1 and 10 mg L- 1) inhibiting conidial germination and mycelial growth of M. roridum isolates. In greenhouse tests, fungicides pyraclostrobin + epoxyconazole, tebuconazole, metconazole, and azoxystrobin + cyproconazole are the most efficient against myrothecium leaf spot disease.

40|$|Proyecto de Graduación (Licenciatura en Ingeniería en Agronomía) Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica, Escuela de Ingeniería en Agronomía, 2015 The {{following}} {{investigation was}} conducted {{with the objective of}} developing strategies to manage the foliar necrosis of cycas with plan knowledge and the study of the etiology of the disease. The investigation was divided in three stages. In the first stage the various phases of leaf development were determined. These were designated as: Infant (V 1), Formation (V 2), Juvenile (V 3) and Mature (V 4). Furthermore a photographic scale represented 12 phases of these foliar development was designed. In the second stage, it was determined that the causal agent of chasparria was Colletotrichum proteae. The fungus was isolated from diseased tissues and inoculations to healthy plants were made. The disease symptoms were reproduced and the same fungus was isolated from infected tissues of all inoculated plants. Furthermore, the symptoms caused by C. proteae under experimental conditions were similar to those observed for chasparria in commercial farms. The disease presented an incubation period (IP) of three to five days on phases V 1, V 2, V 3 and a latent period (LP) of six days; for phase V 4 the IP was seven days and LP nine days. The leaves that were affected with more severity were those of phases V 2 and V 3. In another experiment the sensitivity in vitro of C. proteae to fungicides (protectant and systemic) was tested. Six concentrations of the active ingredient (0. 01, 0, 0. 1, 1, 10, 100 ppm) of each fungicide were tested. The active ingredient were categorized as high sensitivity 50 mgL- 1 (clorotalonil, azoxistrobin, boscalid, mancozeb and mancozeb + oxicloruro de Cobre. Protectant fungicides, <b>metiram,</b> propineb and clorotalonil resulted in a highly percent of inhibition of the mycelial development. Prochloraz, difenoconazole and pyrimethanil were the best of the systemic fungicides tested. During the field trials, two experiments with experimental designs that consisted of five blocks and four treatments were conducted. One of them consisted in the evaluation of the rotation of conventional (T 1) and non-conventional fungicides (T 4) and the addition of acetic acid (50 ml L- 1) (T 2 -T 3). It was determined that the conventional treatment is the best to manage chasparria in field conditions. The acetic acid decreased the severity of the disease in the T 2 and T 3 but increase it in T 1 treatment. In the other field experiment of phase three foliar fertilization using (Ca, Mg and Si as a management strategy for chasparria was tested). Results of this experiment indicate that the treatments did not have an effect in the severity of the symptoms of chasparria. To evaluate the severity of the symptoms in the two field experiments, a scale of 0 - 7 (0 =no symptoms and 7 =severe symptoms) was developed and validated {{at the beginning of the}} experiments. Simultaneously with this study, an informative manual for the management and culture of cycas was developed...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} research plan (2008 to 2010) included comprehensive {{studies on}} two commercial mango cultivars of Pakistan including Sindhri and Sufaid Chaunsa with overall objective of evaluating controlled atmosphere (CA) and modified atmosphere (MA) conditions for sea-freighting mangoes to distant markets. The targeted areas included: a) Benchmark studies {{to monitor and}} document sea freight supply chain from farm to market (Germany); b) Evaluating impact of controlled and modified atmosphere storage conditions; c) Comparing open top vs. closed top boxes for sea freighting mangoes; e) Testing new chemistry fungicides for postharvest disease management, especially Stem End Rot (SER) in mango cv. Sufaid Chaunsa during long term storage and f) effects of pre-cooling on mango cv. Sufaid Chaunsa. Moreover, effect of harvest maturity (mid and late season harvest) on fruit quality and shelf life of Sindhri and Sufaid Chaunsa was also evaluated. Benchmarking studies showed that mango export supply chain to Europe (Germany) using Maersk shipping line requires about 35 days (Farm to retailing). The results revealed that poor skin colour development, skin shriveling, firmness retention in cv. Sindhri while disease development, mainly SER, (caused by organism: Botryodiplodia theobromae and Phomopsis mangiferae) in both cultivars are main issues [...] The static research trials were conducted side by side {{to address these issues}} and to optimize the sea shipment protocols. Controlled atmosphere storage had significant impact on physico-chemical fruit quality and improved market value and consumer acceptability of the two cvs. Exposure to ILOS (Initial low oxygen stress) for one week had no significant negative effect; however, a concentration of 10 % CO 2 was found to be too high and inhibited the fruit ripening completely. These studies indicated that 1 - 1. 5 % O 2 and 4 - 5 % CO 2 as better CA combination for cv. Sindhri and Sufaid Chaunsa mangoes, for 4 weeks shipping period, followed by 5 - 7 days for post arrival handling, ripening and retailing. Mid-season harvested fruit of both cultivars showed better response in terms of better fruit marketability, less disease development and retention of the firmness of stored fruit under CA and MA conditions. Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) trials showed that XÂ®-tend bagging can only suppress the disease development at ripening and can be used for sea shipping mangoes to short distance markets; however the fruit with skin bruises and damages must be avoided for bagging. The experiment on packing mangoes in different types of corrugated boxes concluded that open top boxes were better option for sea shipping of the two mango cvs. since fruit developed good colour in open top boxes. Moreover, cv. Sindhri showed better shipping potential with higher percentage of marketable fruit than cv. Sufaid Chaunsa, which is more prone to post harvest diseases during long term storage. Post-harvest disease study during long term storage in cv. Sufaid Chaunsa showed that the combined application of Thiabendazole @ 2000 ppm with Prochloraz @ 0. 5 ml/L (Tank mix; HWT- 52 Â°C; 5 min) had significant disease control (i. e. stem end rot, side rot and anthracnose). Concentrations of Thiabendazole alone (1000, 1500 and 2000 ppm) did not perform well in this regard. Postharvest application of new chemistry fungicides including Amistar (0. 8 ml/L) (A. I. Azoxystrobin), Nativo (0. 3 g/L) (A. I. Trifloxystrobin and Tebuconazole), Cabrio Top (3 g/L) (A. I. Pyraclostrobin and <b>Metiram)</b> and Scholar were also found to be effective against postharvest disease development in mango. Best control was achieved by Amistar against anthracnose and stem end rot. Moreover, immediate precooling after harvest and processing gave significantly improved disease control and less weight loss in cultivar Sufaid Chaunsa. Finally, during July 2012, an industry collaborated trial shipment of cv. Sindhri was made to a commercial importer in Netherlands in which learning outcomes of these studies were intergraded from harvest to maturity and to marketing. The shipment was overall success with positive comments from importer. Some incidence of pulp breakdown in mangoes at ripe stage was observed which needs future investigation...|$|E
