5|$|At {{this time}} the {{abundance}} of invertebrates crawling around on land and near water, in <b>moist</b> <b>soil</b> and wet litter, offered a food supply. Some were even big enough to eat small tetrapods, but the land was free from dangers common in the water.|$|E
5|$|Females lay {{from ten}} to three hundred eggs at a time, {{depending}} on species, fertilising {{them with the}} stored sperm as they do so. Many species deposit the eggs on <b>moist</b> <b>soil</b> or organic detritus, but some construct nests lined with dried faeces, and may protect the eggs within silk cocoons. In most species, the female abandons the eggs after they are laid, but some species in the orders Platydesmida and Stemmiulida provide parental care for eggs and young.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} entomopathogenic {{nematode}} are important predators of insect and other invertebrate pests. Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita is a microscopic nematode that kills slugs. Its complex life cycle includes a free-living, infective {{stage in the}} soil where it becomes associated with a pathogenic bacteria such as Moraxella osloensis. The nematode enters the slug through the posterior mantle region, thereafter feeding and reproducing inside, {{but it is the}} bacteria that kill the slug. The nematode is available commercially in Europe and is applied by watering onto <b>moist</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{shape and}} size of the egg mass is {{characteristic}} of the species. Ranids tend to produce globular clusters containing large numbers of eggs whereas bufonids produce long, cylindrical strings. The tiny yellow-striped pygmy eleuth (Eleutherodactylus limbatus) lays eggs singly, burying them in <b>moist</b> <b>soil.</b> The smoky jungle frog (Leptodactylus pentadactylus) makes a nest of foam in a hollow. The eggs hatch when the nest is flooded, or the tadpoles may complete their development in the foam if flooding does not occur. The red-eyed treefrog (Agalychnis callidryas) deposits its eggs on a leaf above a pool and when they hatch, the larvae fall into the water below. The larvae developing in the eggs can detect vibrations caused by nearby predatory wasps or snakes, and will hatch early to avoid being eaten. In general, the length of the egg stage depends on the species and the environmental conditions. Aquatic eggs normally hatch within one week when the capsule splits as a result of enzymes released by the developing larvae.|$|E
5|$|Water is an {{important}} resource for colonies living in dry and arid environments, but sometimes {{it may not be}} available. To counter this, workers are able to extract a significant amount of water from the sand with 2%–4% water content and 4% from the soil. Meat ants are unable to retrieve as much water from the soil, whereas with sand they are able to attain a greater amount of water; however, the soil contains a wide variety of particles, including clay and coarse sand, which causes water to be bound firmly. Ants may retrieve it by digging or directly suck on the soil itself at a low metabolic cost. This may be an evolved response based on tested ants, but no observations show meat ants doing this. Meat ants are known to dig into <b>moist</b> <b>soil</b> to gain access to water or where water has been spilt, either if the site is nearby their nest or far away.|$|E

25|$|Saprolegnia is {{tolerant}} to a {{wide range}} of temperature, 3°C to 33°C, but is more prevalent in lower temperatures. While it is found most frequently in freshwater, it will also tolerate brackish water and even <b>moist</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dissimilar buried metals such as {{copper and}} steel can {{function}} as the poles of a galvanic cell, using <b>moist</b> <b>soil</b> as the electrolyte. Stray direct currents in soil may counteract the anti-corrosion effect of a cathodic protection system. Design of high voltage direct current transmission systems must take care so that current flowing in the earth does not cause objectionable corrosion to buried objects such as pipelines.|$|E
25|$|Cannas {{are remarkably}} free of diseases, {{compared}} to many genera. However, they may {{fall victim to}} canna rust, a fungus resulting in orange spots on the plant's leaves, caused by over <b>moist</b> <b>soil.</b> They are also susceptible to certain plant viruses, {{some of which are}} Canna-specific, which may result in spotted or streaked leaves, in a mild form, but can finally result in stunted growth and twisted and distorted blooms and foliage.|$|E

25|$|The {{plant has}} a {{branching}} root system with one primary root that reaches {{deeply into the}} <b>moist</b> <b>soil.</b> Buckwheat has triangular seeds and produces a flower that is usually white, although can also be pink or yellow. Buckwheat branches freely, as opposed to tillering or producing suckers, causing a more complete adaption to its environment than other cereal crops. The seed hull density is {{less than that of}} water, making the hull easy to remove.|$|E
25|$|Adult females lay about 200 {{transparent}} eggs (each about 1 mm long) into <b>moist</b> <b>soil.</b> After {{about one}} week, the larvae hatch. About 90% of the larvae are female. Up to 2,500 per m² {{can be found}}. Several species, especially Sciara militaris, can be found to migrate in processions of up to 10 m, containing thousands of individuals. These processions occur from May to June in central Europe. The larvae there pupate from July to August.|$|E
25|$|Pittas feed in a thrush-like fashion, moving aside {{leaves with}} a {{sweeping}} {{motion of the}} bill. They have also been observed to probe the <b>moist</b> <b>soil</b> with their bills in order to locate earthworms. It {{has been suggested that}} they are able to locate earthworms by smell; a suggestion supported by a study which found that they have the largest olfactory bulb of 25 passerines examined. Some species will also use tree roots and rocks as anvils on which to smash open snails in order to eat.|$|E

25|$|Just {{as having}} too little water is {{detrimental}} to the grapevine, so too is having too much. When vines become water-logged they become a target for various microbial agents such as bacteria and fungi that compete with the vine for nutrients in the soil. Additionally excessively <b>moist</b> <b>soil</b> is poor conductor of valuable heat radiating from the ground. In general wet soils are cold soils which can be especially problematic during the flowering causing poor berry set {{that could lead to}} coulure. It also becomes an issue during the ripening stage when vines in cool-climate regions may need additional heat radiated from the ground in order to sufficiently ripen its fruit (an example of this is the slate-based vineyards of the Mosel in Germany). Therefore, well draining soils are considered very conducive to producing quality wine. In general light-textured (such as sand and gravel) and stony soils tend to drain well. Soils heavy soils and those with high proportions of organic matter also have the potential to drain well if they having a crumbling texture and structure. This texture relates to the friability of the soil which can come from earthworms and other organisms that have burrowed tunnels throughout the soil. Much like rocks, these tunnels give water a freer passageway through soil and contributes to its drainage.|$|E
25|$|N. americanus and A. duodenale eggs can {{be found}} in warm, <b>moist</b> <b>soil</b> where they will {{eventually}} hatch into first stage larvae, or L1. L1, the feeding non-infective rhabditoform stage, will feed on soil microbes and eventually molt into second stage larvae, L2. L2, which is also in the rhabditoform stage, will feed for approximately 7 days and then molt into the third stage larvae, or L3. L3 is the filariform stage of the parasite, that is, the non-feeding infective form of the larvae. The L3 larvae are extremely motile and will seek higher ground to increase their chances of penetrating the skin of a human host. The L3 larvae can survive up to 2 weeks without finding a host. While N. americanus larvae only infect through penetration of skin, A. duodenale can infect both through penetration as well as orally. After the L3 larvae have successfully entered the host, the larvae then travel through the subcutaneous venules and lymphatic vessels of the human host. Eventually, the L3 larvae enter the lungs through the pulmonary capillaries and break out into the alveoli. They will then travel up the trachea to be coughed and swallowed by the host. After being swallowed, the L3 larvae are then found in the small intestine where they molt into the L4, or adult worm stage. The entire process from skin penetration to adult development takes about 5–9 weeks. The female adult worms will release eggs (N. americanus about 9,000–10,000 eggs/day and A. duodenale 25,000–30,000 eggs/day) which are passed in the feces of the human host. These eggs will hatch in the environment within several days and the cycle will start anew.|$|E
