25|$|On 3 March 1944, the {{division}} {{was instructed to}} move to Palestine and the advance parties left on 7 March. On 12 March however, this <b>movement</b> <b>order</b> was countermanded and {{the division}} was instructed to move to Italy. One year after arriving in the Middle East, the division embarked from Alexandria between 14 and 16 April to arrive in Taranto, Italy on 20 and 21 April 1944.|$|E
25|$|Movement {{procedures}} {{varied with}} enemy locations, terrain etc., but generally recon elements from battalions or companies met with local guerrillas or operatives to gain intelligence, map out the terrain ahead, and obtain guides as needed. Security {{was on a}} tight basis with soldiers only being informed at the last minute. A <b>movement</b> <b>order</b> {{was accompanied by a}} thorough cleanup of the area to hide traces of the unit. Trenches, foxholes and other fortifications were generally camouflaged for later reuse.|$|E
25|$|In early 1941, the {{battalion}} moved to Redbank where further training was undertaken {{in preparation for}} joining {{the rest of the}} 27th Brigade. In February the 2/26th was transported to Bathurst where they joined the other two battalions assigned to the brigade along with the artillery, anti-tank and engineer units. Brigade-level exercises were conducted and {{the battalion}} paraded through the town of Bathurst before finally they received orders for embarkation. On 29 July the final <b>movement</b> <b>order</b> was received and the battalion entrained for Melbourne. Although initially it had been intended that the 2/26th, and indeed the entire 8th Division, would be sent to the Middle East to join the 7th and 9th Divisions in the campaign against the Germans and Italians, concerns about Japanese intentions in the Pacific led to the decision to deploy them in Southeast-Asia instead. Embarking upon the Marnix Van St Aldegonde, a Dutch ship of approximately 20,000 tons displacement, their ultimate destination was Singapore.|$|E

25|$|On 1 April 1865 the {{regiment}} arrived at Shreveport, but their stay was short lived. On April 6 {{the regiment}} received another <b>movement</b> <b>order</b> from Major General Churchill which {{stated that the}} division would move at sunrise on April 8 towards Marshall, Texas. The 36th Arkansas arrived in Marshall six days later with a reported strength of 598 soldiers having lost one soldier in a skirmish with Federal cavalry, two captured and having to leave behind two soldiers that were too sick to travel any further. At Marshall, they immediately began to construct defenses {{on the east side}} of the town. On 11 May 1865 as the work on the town defenses continued, the regiment lost its last three soldiers, all from Company C, captured by Federal cavalry as they were on picket duty. An order from the division commander halted work on the defenses on 14 May without any further details. Those details came twelve days later, on 26 May 1865 when the 36th Arkansas was surrendered with the remainder of General Kirby Smith’s army. The strength of the regiment that day was 587 officers and soldiers.|$|E

It is her first book on her experiences of working as a lecturer in English in a school in Bhutan, the tantric Buddhist kingdom in eastern Himalayas. She provides extensive knowledge about the country which till the early 1960s was not even connected by road links and was dependent only on barter trade, and its people were ruled by a king. The book is divided into six chapters (Arrival, Entrance, <b>Movement</b> <b>Order,</b> Peak of Higher Learning, Involvement and Love) followed by a postscript.|$|E
