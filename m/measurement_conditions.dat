The most commonly used statistical principle to detect and remove the effects of artificial changes is relative homogenization, which assumes that nearby stations are exposed to almost the same climate signal and that thus the differences between nearby stations can be utilized to detect inhomogeneities. By looking at the difference time series, the year-to-year variability of the climate is removed, as well as regional climatic trends. In such a difference time series, a clear and persistent jump of, for example 1 °C, can easily be detected and can only be due {{to changes in the}} <b>measurement</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} {{intercept}} point {{is based on}} the assumption of a weakly nonlinear system, meaning that higher-order nonlinear terms are small enough to be negligible.In practice, the weakly nonlinear assumption may not hold for the upper end of the input power range, be it during measurement or during use of the amplifier. As a consequence, measured or simulated data will deviate from the ideal slope of n.The intercept point according to its basic definition should be determined by drawing the straight lines with slope 1 and n through the measured data at the smallest possible power level (possibly limited towards lower power levels by instrument or device noise).It is a frequent mistake to derive intercept points by either changing the slope of the straight lines, or fitting them to points measured at too high power levels. In certain situations such a measure can be useful, but it is not an intercept point according to definition. Its value depends on the <b>measurement</b> <b>conditions</b> that need to be documented, whereas the IP according to definition is mostly unambiguous; although there is some dependency on frequency and tone spacing, depending on the physics of the device under test.|$|E
