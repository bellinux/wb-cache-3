40|$|Purpose To {{determine}} how kilovoltage (kV), milliampere seconds (mAs), and focal spot size affect perceptual image quality using a hand phantom. Methods Using computed radiography, 70 {{images of a}} posteroanterior (PA) oblique hand phantom were acquired with different kilovolt and <b>milliampere</b> <b>second</b> values using large and small focal spot sizes. Images were displayed on qualitycontrolled monitors with dimmed ambient lighting. The look-up table for hand radiography was used for image display. Five diagnostic radiographers scored each image for perceptual image quality against a reference image using a 5 -point Likert scale. Results No significant difference in image quality was found between small and large focal spot sizes at different kilovolt (P =. 46) and <b>milliampere</b> <b>second</b> (P =. 56) values. As milliampere seconds increase, perceptual image quality increases gradually from 0. 4 mAs to 4 mAs, after which perceptual image quality begins to deteriorate. When kilovolts increase to {{within the range of}} 40 kV to 55 kV, perceptual image quality increases; image quality remains stable after 55 kV. Discussion This study shows that both large and small focal spot sizes produce images of similar quality, and a wide range of kilovolt and milliampere seconds can be used to produce images of acceptable quality. The implications of these findings include the potential for extending the life of radiography equipment and the potential for reducing the dose patients receive during appendicular examinations. Conclusion Large focal spot size can be used for PA oblique hand imaging without affecting perceptual image quality. Perceptual image quality remains acceptable and stable {{for a wide range of}} kilovolt and <b>milliampere</b> <b>second</b> values. Optimizatio...|$|E
40|$|We {{performed}} direct radiographic magnification (X 3) using a 0. 1 -mm microfocal {{tube and}} computed radiography (CR) in air-barium doublecontrast {{studies of the}} stomach and duodenum. To eliminate blurring of the image due to motion, we used the maximum kilovolt peak rate possible (102 kVp), the maximum <b>milliampere</b> <b>second</b> rate possible (64 mAs), the shortest possible exposure time (0. 1 second), and a horizontal x-ray beam. With the patients in the supine position, CR provided the wide image reproduction range required to obtain satisfactory radiographs. Image processing in the CR system produced radiographs with increased radiographic contrast and enhanced edge definition of anatomic borders or pathologic processes. The duodenal villi were clearly visible in 45 % of the cases...|$|E
30|$|All CT {{images were}} {{obtained}} using dual energy CT (DECT) (Somatom-Definition DS, software version VE 20 : Siemens Healthcare) operated in the dual-energy mode with tube A at 80  kV and 499  mA, tube B at 140  kV and 118  mA (effective <b>milliampere</b> <b>seconds</b> of 714 and 168, respectively), and a collimation of 14 [*]×[*] 1.2  mm. Two image sets with 5.0 -mm-thick and 1.5 -mm-thick sections were reconstructed by using H 30 (medium smooth) and D 37 s (dual-energy, medium sharp) kernels, respectively. Each image set consisted of an 80 -kV series, a 140 -kV series, {{and a third}} series, which combined the 80 -kV and 140 -kV images to produce a virtual 120 -kV image set. The combined images have a higher signal–to-noise ratio than the constituent 80 -kV and 140 -kV image sets.|$|R
40|$|Pelvic {{radiography}} is a frequently performed radiological examination. Its average {{effective dose}} (E) is 0. 53 mSv which {{is comparable to}} the annual per caput dose from diagnostic radiology, 0. 6 mSv. However, existing studies on optimum tube potential for pelvic X-rays tend to be limited to screen-film and computed radiography. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the tube voltage for dose-image optimisation in pelvic direct radiography (DR). Fifty-four pelvic phantom images were acquired using 50 - 135 kV at 5 kV increments (three images taken at each kV level) and <b>milliampere</b> <b>seconds</b> determined by automatic exposure control. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and dose were measured for each image. Figure of merit (FOM) defined as the ratio of SNR 2 to E was used to determine the optimum tube potential. The FOM indicates 135 kV is the optimum setting for pelvic DR. Using the European Commission tube voltage recommendation (75 - 90 kV) as a reference point, there was only a slight (5. 56 %) decrease of image quality in the femoral neck region at 135 kV. However, its E was 0. 054 mSv. This appreciable dose reduction potential could be attributed to the improvement of detective quantum efficiency and image processing technology of the recent DR system...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: A {{reject rate}} is the {{percentage}} of diagnostic images repeated due to errors during radiological examinations. The present study aimed to evaluate the patient radiation doses and analyze the film reject rate as part of quality assurance program in three diagnostic centers in Nigeria. Materials and Methods: This {{study was conducted in}} three hospitals, namely Federal Medical Center (FMC), General Hospital (GH), and Sacred Heart Hospital (SHH), located in Abeokuta, Ogun State, Southwestern Nigeria. For the purpose of the study, the accepted and rejected radiographs during different X-ray examinations were recorded. A total of 376 rejected and accepted radiographs were evaluated in the three hospitals, and the economic losses due to rejected films were determined. The quality control (QC) tests, which involve kilo voltage (kV), <b>milliampere</b> <b>seconds</b> (mAs), etc, were carried out on the facilities of two out of three hospitals using Victoreen 6000 m QC kits. The results of the QC tests and exposure parameters were used to estimate the patient doses for different examinations carried out during the study. Results: Based on the results of the study, the SHH  had the highest estimated annual loss of $ 225, followed by the FMC and GH with annual monetary losses of $ 208 and $ 166, respectively. In addition, the anteroposterior projection of the lumbosacral spine had the highest mean dose (15 ± 1. 64 mGy) in this study, which was observed in the SHH. Additionally, at FMC, all the estimated doses were low. Conclusion: Regarding the monetary loss and increase in patient dose burden involved in repeated examinations, it is essential to train personnel on the factors leading to repeated exposures...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. We present {{our initial}} {{clinical}} {{experience with a}} recently introduced 64 -detector computed tomography (64 -MDCT) scanner that makes use of a periodic motion of the focal spot in the longitudinal direction (z-flying focal spot), which enables it to reach a final spatial resolution of 0. 4 × 0. 4 × 0. 4 mm 3 and a temporal resolution of 83 ms. Materials and methods. A total of 114 patients (108 men, six women; age range 36 - 77 years, mean 63. 1 years) underwent retrospective electrocardiogram (ECG) -gated examination of the coronary arteries using a 64 -MDCT scanner (Somatom Sensation 64, Siemens Medical Solutions, Germany). Acquisition parameters were the following: collimation 64 × 0. 6 mm, 800 quality reference <b>milliampere</b> <b>second</b> (mAs), 120 kVp, 0. 33 -s gantry rotation time and pitch 0. 2. Images were acquired in all cases after i. v. administration of 80 ml of contrast agent (Iomeron 400 mgI/dl, Bracco, Italy) + 30 ml of saline at 4 /s and delay time determined using a bolus triggering technique. Oral betablockers were administered to patients with heart rate (HR) > 75 bpm. To reduce radiation exposure, an automatic exposure control system was applied in all cases to adapt tube current to patient size and anatomic shape (CARE Dose 4 D, Siemens Medical Solutions, Germany). The optimal temporal window for raw data reconstruction was chosen from an initial preview of images reconstructed with different phase settings (range 0 %- 95 % RR interval with 5 % gap) at a selected anatomical level in the mid part of the right coronary artery. CT dose index volume and effective dose were quantified in all patients using dedicated software. Results. Mean HR recorded during image acquisition was 65. 6 ± 19. 2 bmp (range: 44 - 96 bmp), and beta-blockers were administered to 16 / 114 patients (14. 0 %). Technical adequacy was achieved in all patients but two (2 / 114; 1. 7 %). In patients with HR 80 bmp), high image quality was observed in end-systole (30 %- 35 % of the RR interval). Mean CT dose index (CTDI) volume was 36. 53 ± 8. 30 mGy per patient. In comparison with a conventional examination with fixed mAs, {{the use of the}} CARE Dose 4 D system provided a 33. 3 % CTDI volume reduction (p< 0. 001). Mean effective dose was 9. 5 ± 3. 4 millisievert (mSv) per patient (range 7. 1 - 17. 7). Conclusions. The 64 -MDCT scanner diagnostic performance for coronary CT angiography is further improved with better spatial and temporal resolution and faster scan times; besides, initial clinical results are promising. The use of dose-reducing acquisition techniques is mandatory to limit radiation exposure to the patient. © 2007 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|Background: With {{increasing}} use {{of diagnostic}} X-ray machines across Lagos, South-West Nigeria, relevant international bodies have proposed the use of reference dose levels (RDLs) to help manage radiation dose to patients without compromising image quality. Objectives: The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the entrance surface dose (ESD) at third quartile (75 th percentile) in Lagos metropolis for normal adult radiographic examinations and to compare them with national and international established reference dose guidelines. Materials and Methods: One dedicated X-ray unit in each diagnostic center was used for this study denoted as H 1 -H 10. A noninvasive Unfors ThinX RAD kilovoltage (kVp) meter which served as the phantom (mimicked patient) was used for measurements. The ESDs were determined by placing the Unfors ThinX RAD kVp meter on the patient′s table bucky at a source to image distance (SID) of 100 cm and at the erect bucky at a SID of 180 cm. The peak tube kVp was varied at different <b>milliampere</b> <b>seconds</b> (mAs). Results : The mean ESD for adult postero-anterior (PA) chest, antero-posterior (AP) Abdomen and (AP) lumbar spine X-ray examination were 0. 603, 2. 57, and 2. 57 mGy, respectively. While the ESD for the third quartile for adult (PA) chest, (AP) abdomen, and (AP) lumbar spine X-ray examination among the ten X-ray centers were 0. 93, 2. 74, and 2. 47 mGy, respectively. Conclusion: Third quartile ESD which translate to RDL for adult (PA) chest examination for this study was higher compared to other national and international RDLs but adult (AP) abdomen and lumbar spine examinations were within accepted national and international range...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To compare single-detector row {{computed}} tomography (CT) and multi-detector row CT {{by using an}} experimental phantom containing a contrast-detail modulus for detection of low-contrast structures to optimize acquisition protocols. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The parameters <b>milliampere</b> <b>seconds,</b> reconstructed section thickness, and elementary collimation for multi-detector CT were varied for two pitches with single- and multi-detector CT. For objective assessment of image quality, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was calculated for an 8 -HU low-contrast 15 -mm-diameter object. Subjective assessment of image quality was performed by means of visual detection of low-contrast objects of various sizes by four independent observers. For each acquisition protocol, the effective doses required to obtain the CNR thresholds allowing 100 % detection of 5 -, 7 -, and 9 -mm-diameter objects were compared at single- and multi-detector CT at comparable section sensitivity profile with analysis of variance. RESULTS: Significant correlation was found between CNR measurements and subjective object detection (r = 0. 95, P &lt;. 05). CNRs of 1. 0, 0. 8, and 0. 6 were required to detect 100 % of the 5 -, 7 -, and 9 -mm-diameter objects, respectively. For reconstructed section thickness of 5 - 10 mm, comparable x-ray doses were required with single- and multi-detector CT to detect objects. For reconstructed sections thinner than 5 mm, single- and multi-detector CT allowed detection of only the 7 - and 9 -mm-thick objects, but a higher x-ray dose was required for multi- than for single-detector CT (P &lt;. 05). CONCLUSION: Multi-detector CT is less effective than single-detector CT in detection of small low-contrast objects if sections thinner than 5 mm are used. Results for single- and multi-detector CT were similar for sections 5 mm or thicker...|$|R
40|$|Background: Concern {{has been}} raised {{regarding}} the mounting collective radiation doses from computed tomography (CT), increasing the risk of radiation-induced cancers in exposed populations. Purpose: To compare radiation dose and image quality in a chest phantom and in patients for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) at 100 and 120 peak kilovoltage (kVp) using 16 -multichannel detector computed tomography (MDCT). Material and Methods: A 20 -ml syringe containing 12 mg I/ml was scanned in a chest phantom at 100 / 120 kVp and 25 <b>milliampere</b> <b>seconds</b> (mAs). Consecutive patients underwent 100 kVp (n = 50) and 120 kVp (n = 50) 16 -MDCT using a "quality reference" effective mAs of 100, 300 mg I/kg, and a 12 -s injection duration. Attenuation (CT number), image noise (1 standard deviation), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR; fresh clot = 70 HU) of the contrast medium syringe and pulmonary arteries were evaluated on 3 -mm-thick slices. Subjective image quality was assessed. Computed tomography dose index (CTDI(vol)) and dose-length product (DLP) were presented by the CT software, and effective dose was estimated. Results: Mean values in the chest phantom and patients changed as follows when X-ray tube potential decreased from 120 to 100 kVp: attenuation + 23 % and + 40 %, noise + 38 % and + 48 %, CNR - 6 % and 0 %, and CTDI(vol) - 38 % and - 40 %, respectively. Mean DLP and effective dose in the patients decreased by 42 % and 45 %, respectively. Subjective image quality was excellent or adequate in 49 / 48 patients at 100 / 120 kVp. No patient with a negative CT had any thromboembolism diagnosed during 3 -month follow-up. Conclusion: By reducing X-ray tube potential from 120 to 100 kVp, while keeping all other scanning parameters unchanged, the radiation dose to the patient may be almost halved without deterioration of diagnostic quality, which may be of particular benefit in young individuals...|$|R
40|$|In this {{investigation}} the primary object {{has been to}} study the possible effect of weak electric currents, similar to those existing in nature, upon plant growth and certain phases of the environment. The experiments have been of two types: (1) Those using the earth-air currents collected and discharged by means of elevated metal brushes, and (2) those using currents generated {{as the result of}} differences in potential between buried, aerially connected, copper and zinc electrodes, sometimes augmented by dry cells placed in the circuits. In both types the currents developed have been applied to the root areas of the plants. 1. Currents obtained by means of. the installation of elevated metal brushes connected with buried wires trans versing the root areas of field crops apparently had little effect on yields. Yearly averages show a variation from the controls with corn of - 2. 78 to + 4. 51 percent; with soybeans of + 0. 29 to + 3. 16 percent; with turnips of - 3. 95 to + 7. 03 percent; with chard of + 3. 39 to + 9. 08 percent; with beets of + 5. 55 to + 11. 05 percent; with string beans of + 1. 82 to + 3. 91 percent. 2. Currents passing through the elevated metal brushes during fair weather changed direction frequently and were of the order of from 5. 0 x 10 - 10 amperes to 1. 0 x 10 - 9 amperes. During unsettled weather the currents varied greatly, both in direction and magnitude, the highest value being of the order of 200 x 10 - 9 amperes. 3. The intensities of the currents measured in the soil and along the buried conductor at various distances from one of the elevated 2 ̆ 7 brushes seemed to bear no relation to the intensities measured {{at the point where the}} conductor entered the soil. 4. The application of currents ranging in intensity from 7, 000 to 20, 000 volts to the roots of oats in greenhouse fiats did not produce significant variations in yields of grain and straw. The yields of the treated lots varied both above and below the average of the controls, and none yielded more than the higher control. The high voltage currents were applied for 15 minutes each day throughout the growing period. 5. The greenhouse treatments in which an electrode of copper and one of zinc were buried at opposite ends of the soil area to be treated, and connected aerially by copper wire, produced significant increases in yields of oats the first year of the experiment. Currents measured were of the order of from 0. 5 to 1. 5 <b>milliamperes.</b> The <b>second</b> year of the experiment, the grain and straw yields were not increased by treatment with electric current, while root yields were significantly decreased. For this test one or two dry cells were included in the circuit for each treated lot, and current intensities ranged as high as 4. 0 milliamperes. 6. In the field trials with oats the copper-zinc electrodes combination, with dry cells included in the circuits, provided current intensities ranging from 2. 0 to 55. 0 milliamperes but failed to affect the yields significantly. 7. In the comparisons using the copper-zinc electrodes combination, the percentage of total nitrogen of oats apparently was not affected by treatment with electric current. 8. With the exception of the determinations made in connection with the field tests, a rather definite relationship between electrical treatment and numbers of soil microorganisms was observed throughout the series of experiments. In the 1932 greenhouse experiment, a comparison of 24 samples showed increases for the electrically treated lots of 14 to 123 percent and of 15 to 23 percent for 20 samples in 1933. Further proof was provided by the carbon dioxide determinations, a weak current of 0. 1 milliampere producing appreciable increases in amounts of carbon dioxide formed and a relatively strong current of 10 to 15 milliamperes resulting in pronounced decreases...|$|R
