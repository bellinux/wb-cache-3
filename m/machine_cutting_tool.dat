The output of process planning generally includes operations, <b>machine</b> <b>tools,</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tools,</b> fixtures, <b>machining</b> parameters, etc. Computer-aided process planning (CAPP) is an important interface between computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) in the computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) environment. A good process plan of a part is built up based on two elements: (1) optimized sequence of {{the operations of the}} part; and (2) optimized selection of the machineand <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> for each operation. On the other hand, two levels of planning in the process {{planning is}} suggested: (1) preliminary and (2) secondary and detailed planning.

Then in the detailed planning stage, using a genetic algorithm again which prunes the initial feasible sequences, the optimized operations sequence and the optimized selection of the <b>machine</b> and <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> for each operation are obtained.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an increasing demand of Top-Spinning (T-S) {{has resulted in}} the production of high quantity of T-S. Currently, the production of T-S is very low and not up to the required demand. This is due to the old machine used as well as an old method in the manufacturing of T-S, which lead to the longer time taken compared to the new technology found in this project. The cardinal purpose of this project is to identify the machining sequence with the selection of a suitable tool and reducing machining cycle time with the use of CNC Lathe for manufacturing T-S. In ensuring a successful and optimum result of the project, manufacturing T-S with CNC Lathe will be assisted by Mathematisch Technishe software Entwicklung (MTS) and Master CAM simulation to determine <b>machining</b> sequence, <b>cutting</b> <b>tools,</b> technology parameters and machining cycle time.

40|$|Process {{reliability}} and dynamic stability {{is a growing}} customer demand in the metal machining industry. A limiting factor in process stability is regenerative vibrations which may damage the <b>machined</b> component, the <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> and even the machine tool. Spindle speed optimization to ensure process stability and enable larger cutting depths {{is based on the}} <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> and <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> assembly's frequency response at the tool-tip. The traditional procedure to retrieve the tool-tip frequency response is to conduct dynamic testing of each <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> mounted <b>cutting</b> <b>tool.</b> This methodology is normally very time-consuming.

The accuracy of the predicted tool-tip frequency response is then dependent on the quality of measured data.
