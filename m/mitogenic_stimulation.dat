METHODS: Blood {{samples were collected}} from 10 farmers within seven days before exposure, one to 12 days after exposure, and again 50 to 70 days after exposure. Whole blood was used to count lymphocyte subsets with monoclonal antibodies. Peripheral blood mononuclear (PBM) cells were used to measure natural killer (NK) cell activity and lymphocyte response to <b>mitogenic</b> <b>stimulations.</b> Values before exposure were used as reference. RESULTS: In comparison with concentrations before exposure, a significant reduction was found one to 12 days after exposure in the following variables (P < 0. 05) : circulating helper (CD 4) and suppressor T cells (CD 8), CD 8 dim, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), natural killer cells (NK), and CD 8 cells expressing the surface antigens HLA-DR (CD 8 -DR), and lymphoproliferative response to mitogen stimulations. All immunological values found 50 - 70 days after exposure were comparable with concentrations before exposure, but mitogenic proliferative responses of lymphocytes were still significantly decreased. CONCLUSIONS: According to our data agricultural exposure to commercial 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) and 4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) formulations may exert short term immunosuppressive effects. Further studies should clarify whether the immunological changes found may have health implications and can specifically contribute to cancer aetiology...|$|R

In vivo cell proliferation is significantly augmented in the B and T cells, monocytes, macrophages, and erythroid progenitors in the spleens of p 27 Kip 1 −/−; p 130 −/− animals. Immunoprecipitation and immunodepletion studies indicate that p 130 can compensate for the absence of p 27 Kip 1 in binding to and repressing CDK 2 and is the predominant CDK-inhibitor associated with the inactive CDK 2 in the p 27 Kip 1 −/− splenocytes. The finding that the p 27 Kip 1 −/−; p 130 −/− splenic B cells are hypersensitive to <b>mitogenic</b> <b>stimulations</b> in vitro lends support to the concept that the hyperproliferation of splenocytes is not a result of the influence of their microenvironment.

40|$|Abstract. Tensin, a 200 -kD phosphoprotein of focal contacts, {{contains}} sequence homologies to Src (SH 2 domain), {{and several}} actin-binding proteins. These features suggest that tensin may link the cell membrane to the cytoskeleton and respond directly to tyrosine kinase signalling pathways. Here we identify three distinct actin-binding domains within tensin. Recombinant tensin purified after overexpression by a baculovirus system binds to actin filaments with Kd = 0. 1 /zM, cross-links actin filaments at a molar ratio of 1 : 10 (tensin/actin), and retards actin assembly by F OCAL contacts (adhesion plaques, focal adhesions) are specialized regions of plasma membranes where cultured cells such as fibroblasts {{adhere to the}} underlying substratum and where actin filament bundles terminate (Burridge et al., 1988; Geiger, 1989; Luna and Hitt, 1992). Focal contacts might be the sites where external signals such as <b>mitogenic</b> <b>stimulations</b> are transduced into the interior of cells (Lo and Chen, 1994). In the course of cell cycling or neoplastic transformation, major reorganizations of focal contacts {{are believed to be}} responsible for the loss of adhesion and concomitant morphological changes (Kellie, 1988).

The supramolecular structure of the linkage between actin filaments and the plasma membrane at the focal contacts is, however, poorly understood.

40|$|Two {{distinct}} mitogenic modes coexist in thyroid epithelial cells. TSH via cAMP induces {{proliferation and}} differentiation expression, whereas growth factors including {{epidermal growth factor}} (EGF) induce proliferation and dedifferentiation. Divergent models of TSH/cAMP-dependent mitogenesis have emerged from different thyroid cell culture systems. In the FRTL- 5 rat cell line, cAMP cross-signals with transduction pathways of growth factors to induce cyclin D 1 and p 21 (cip 1) and down-regulate p 27 (kip 1). By contrast, in canine primary cultures, mitogenic pathways of cAMP and growth factors are fully distinct. cAMP does not induce D-type cyclins and p 21, it up-regulates p 27, and it stimulates the formation and activity of cyclin D 3 -cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 complexes. In primary cultures of normal human thyrocytes, EGF + serum increased cyclin D 1 and p 21 accumulation, and it stimulated the assembly and activity of cyclin D 1 -CDK 4 -p 21 complexes. By contrast, TSH repressed or did not induce cyclin D 1 and p 21, and it rather up-regulated p 27. TSH did not increase cyclin D 1 -CDK 4 activity, but it stimulated the activating phosphorylation of CDK 4 and the pRb-kinase activity of preexisting cyclin D 3 -CDK 4 complexes. As recently demonstrated in dog thyrocytes and other systems, cyclin D 1 and cyclin D 3 differently oriented the site specificity of CDK 4 pRb-kinase activity, which might differently impact some pRb functions. Cyclin D 1 or cyclin D 3 are thus differentially used in the distinct <b>mitogenic</b> <b>stimulations</b> by growth factors or TSH, and potentially in hyperproliferative diseases generated by the overactivation of their respective signaling pathways.

To better understand the role played by sex hormones in modulating the immune response of the genital tract to microbial infections, we have developed a rat model to study Chlamydia trachomatis infection. Inbred female Lewis rats were primed with progesterone and inoculated by intrauterine instillation of C. trachomatis (mouse pneumonitis strain MoPn) into each uterine horn. When infected animals were examined for the presence of chlamydial antigens 14 days postinfection, both the uterus and vagina were found to be positive compared to those of saline-treated animals, which did not show specific staining. The involvement of local and systemic immune systems following chlamydial infection was determined by analyzing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression in the reproductive tract and lymphocyte proliferation in response to <b>mitogenic</b> and chlamydia-specific <b>stimulation</b> of cells from the spleen and lymph nodes (LN) draining the reproductive tract. Enhanced proliferation was observed in LN following mitogenic but not antigenic (MOMP [major outer membrane protein]) stimulation. In contrast, spleen cell proliferation was lower in chlamydia-infected rats than in saline-treated controls. MHC class II expression, an indicator of inflammatory responses, was upregulated in the uterus, on glandular epithelial cells, and adjacent to glands in response to chlamydial infection. In other experiments, when rats were infected at estrus and diestrus without prior progesterone priming, chlamydial inclusions were not detected in either the uterus or vagina. However, enhanced lymphocyte proliferation was observed in response to <b>mitogenic</b> and MOMP <b>stimulation</b> in the reproductive tract-draining LN from estrous and diestrous animals.

When unfractionated or plastic-adherent spleen cells from BCG-infected mice were cultured with normal spleen cells, a strong depression of their reactivity to phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, and lipopolysaccharide was observed. After the removal of cells adherent to plastic, the response was partially restored in the nonadherent population from mice infected i. p., but not in that from mice infected i. v. After <b>mitogenic</b> <b>stimulation,</b> lymph node cells of mice inoculated subcutaneously showed a response to mitogen higher than that of normal cells. These results thus demonstrate that, depending on the route of administration, BCG exerts very different effects...|$|E
40|$|Three {{aspects of}} the calcium {{hypothesis}} we have proposed previously [Metcalfe, Pozzan, Smith & Hesketh (1980) Biochem. Soc. Symp. 45, 1 - 26] for the control of <b>mitogenic</b> <b>stimulation</b> of lymphocytes are examined in studies on the mitogenic action of the Ca 2 + ionophore A 23187 {{and its effect on}} cap formation. (1) Pig lymphocytes that were mitogenically stimulated by continuous incubation with 3 H-labelled A 23187 for 48 h contained between 3 and 15 amol of ionophore per cell. Lymphocytes exposed to 3 H-labelled A 23187 for 2 h before washing the cells and resuspending them in ionophore-free medium were only stimulated mitogenically at 48 h if the residual ionophore associated with the cells after washing was in the concentration range 3 - 15 amol per cell. When the cells were washed repeatedly after 2 h incubation with ionophore to reduce the cell-associated ionophore below the critical concentration range, no <b>mitogenic</b> <b>stimulation</b> occurred as a result of short-term exposure to any ionophore concentration. Re-addition of ionophore to within the indicated range of cell-associated concentrations restored <b>mitogenic</b> <b>stimulation</b> at 48 h. We conclude that large, short-term Ca 2 + fluxes into the cells induced by the ionophore cannot generate a mitogenic signal that commits the cells to enter the cell cycle. (2) Further experiments with the ionophore showed that detectable <b>mitogenic</b> <b>stimulation</b> at 48 h required a minimum of 3 h exposure to optimal ionophore concentrations, and that maximal stimulation required at least 20 h exposure. This is consistent with the view that a prolonged increase in the free cytoplasmic calcium concentration is required to stimulate the maximum proportion of the cells into the cell cycle. (3) Mouse splenic lymphocytes treated for short periods with very high ionophore concentrations (30 microM) in the presence of various external Ca 2 + concentrations showed significant inhibition of cap formation of surface immunoglobulin receptors in the range 1 - 10 microM-Ca 2 + in normal or depolarizing medium. We conclude that mitogens at optimal concentrations for the stimulation of lymphocytes do not cause any early increase in the free cytoplasmic Ca 2 + concentration above 10 microM...|$|E

After suitable absorption, the sera were specific for thymocytes and T lymphoblasts, or B lymphoblasts and several lymphoblastoid cell lines.

40|$|CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) {{is a key}} rate-controlling enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway {{leading to}} the {{principle}} membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine. CCTα is the predominant isoform expressed in mammalian cells. To investigate the role of CCTα {{in the development and}} function of B-lymphocytes, mice with B-lymphocytes that selectively lacked CCTα were derived using the CD 19 -driven Cre/loxP system. When challenged with a T-cell-dependent antigen, the animals harboring CCTα-deficient B-cells exhibited a hyper-IgM secretion phenotype coupled with a lack of IgG production. The inability of CCTα-/- B-cells to undergo class switch recombination correlated with a proliferation defect in vivo and in vitro in response to antigenic and <b>mitogenic</b> stimuli. Lipopolysaccharide <b>stimulation</b> of CCTα-/- B-cells resulted in an early trigger of the unfolded protein response-mediated splicing of Xbp- 1 mRNA, and this was accompanied by accelerated kinetics of IgM secretion and higher incidence of IgM-secreting cells. Thus, the inability of stimulated B-cells to produce enough phosphatidylcholine prevents proliferation and class switch recombination but leads to unfolded protein response activation and a hyper-IgM secretion phenotype...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthetic}} diacylglycerol 1 -oleoyl- 2 -acetylglycerol competes {{directly with}} [3 H]phorbol 12, 13 -dibutyrate for common binding sites in monolayer cultures of Swiss 3 T 3 cells and rapidly stimulates the phosphorylation of a Mr 80, 000 cellular protein that {{has recently been}} shown to reflect the activation of protein kinase C in intact cells. Thus, this diacylglycerol provided a useful tool to determine whether exogenously added diacylglycerols can mimic the potent tumor promoter phorbol ester in eliciting DNA synthesis and cell division in quiescent cells. We found that OAG acts synergistically with insulin and other growth factors to stimulate reinitiation of cell proliferation, and several lines of evidence indicate that OAG shares with phorbol esters a common pathway of <b>mitogenic</b> action via <b>stimulation</b> of protein kinase C activity in intact 3 T 3 cells. The findings {{support the hypothesis that}} diacylglycerols represent endogenous analogs of phorbol esters and raise the possibility that diacylglycerols generated in the plasma membrane could act as a mitogenic signal for quiescent cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} the graft vs. host disease (GVH) ~ on murine immune {{functions}} are currently under intensive study. A recent report (1) {{suggests that there is}} a heightened immune responsiveness during the 1 st wk of the GVH reaction followed subsequently by immunosuppression. These time differences in immune reactivity may explain, at least in part, earlier contradictory reports on the level of the antibody response (2, 3) and the effects on tumor growth (4 - 8) of GVH reactions. In addition, the late immunosuppression has been implicated in C-type RNA viral release and an increased incidence of lymphoreticular malignancies (9). The relationship, however, among chronic immunostimulation, immunosuppression, and the development of lymphomas remains unclear. Moreover, the mechanism of immunosuppression is unknown. Virus particles, suppressor T cells, and macrophages have all been implicated (10 - 12). Recently Phillips (13) has demonstrated a suppressive substance released from thymicdependent lymphocytes in the GVH reaction. This factor decreases the response of normal lymphocytes to <b>mitogenic</b> and allogeneic <b>stimulation</b> (1) and may b...|$|R
