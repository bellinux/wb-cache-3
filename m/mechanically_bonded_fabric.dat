40|$|Within the {{framework}} of this research project, the requirements {{to be made of}} a sealing system with a plastic GEOMEMBRANE LINER as the sealing element when used as sealing material in roads in water procurement areas were studied. The chemical stresses on plastic GEOMEMBRANE LINERS for this application are much less than in waste dump construction. Normally, it is only necessary to demonstrate long-term resistance to oils, fuels and salt solutions as, on account of the good opportunities for sanitation, the plastic GEOMEMBRANE LINER is only polluted for a short time by liquids dispersed {{in the event of an}} accident. When installing the sealing system in the embankment it must be demonstrated that the covering layer cannot slide off the sealing system. Diagrams for three limiting embankment geometries were produced with which proof of this can be produced with a known natural angle of incline of the covering material and limiting surface natural angle of incline of the sealing system. Furthermore, it was shown how a reinforcing element can be used to increase the stability and how the necessary reinforcement tensile force is calculated. In order to determine the limiting surface natural angle of incline of the sealing system, shear tests were carried out in a shear device with dimensions 30 x 30 cm. The following structure was tested: covering layer/reinforcing element/geotextile support layer/plastic GEOMEMBRANE LINER/geotextile protective layer. Tests were carried out with 3 soils, 2 reinforcing elements and plastic GEOMEMBRANE LINERS with various surface structures. In order to protect the plastic GEOMEMBRANE LINER against mechanical damage, <b>mechanically</b> <b>bonded</b> <b>fabrics</b> can be used. In laboratory and field tests, studies were carried out on what requirements these protective layers must meet depending on the loads which arise. (orig.)

40|$|The load {{elongation}} behaviour of geotextiles is decisively {{influenced by the}} surrounding soil. This influence on behaviour has previously been quantifiable only insufficiently and cannot therefore be used in current dimensioning procedures. This uncertainty leads to low coefficients of utilisation of the geotextiles in the dimensioning procedures and thus to constructions which cannot be evaluated in terms of safety and which are often not economical. With the laboratory tests 'lateral pressure device' and 'transverse force introduction', the bond behaviour of geotextiles with the surrounding soil was realistically simulated and studied. These tests provided input parameters for calculations using the finite element method (FEM). Lateral pressure devices were used to study the {{load elongation}} behaviour of geotextiles in contact with soil. These test devices {{make it possible to}} apply a tensile load to the geotextiles in the soil. The geotextile sample is fastened on two clamps; one end is held in place. At the other end the tensile force is introduced. Vertically to the geotextile level, soil layers and compressed air bellows are installed. These compressed air bellows are used to simulate the load in the construction. In the tests, various geotextile products (<b>mechanically</b> <b>bonded</b> <b>fabrics,</b> thermally <b>bonded</b> <b>fabric,</b> woven textile) were studied. Two different types of soil (fine gravel and coarse clay) were used. The influence of the type of soil and the soil load on the load elongation behaviour were studied. The tests showed that the deformation behaviour of the geotextiles studies is decisively characterised by the soil. The deformation module of the geotextile samples is clearly higher in the bond with the soil than in the tests without contact to the soil. This is caused by the transmission of transverse strain between soil and geotextile and by the dispersion of soil particles {{in the structure of the}} geotextiles. Thus an inner bond arises. The raw material of the geotextiles had a clear influence on the deformation behaviour. The tests showed that exceptional suitability of polyester as a reinforcement material. The transverse movement test is a modified shear test in which a geotextile reinforcement is also installed in addition to the soil material. The reinforcement is perpendicular arranged in relation to the shear joint. This test construction is used to simulate the behaviour of the geotextile/soil/bond system in the proximity of the fracture joint in reinforced steep slopes which is formed when the shear strength of the soil material is exceeded. The deformation of the geotextile which occurs under this transverse force load causes an increase in the resistance to shearing and thus an increase of the ultimate load of these bond systems. On the basis of the results of this research study, it is possible to give a plausible explanation for the good success with geotextiles as reinforcement of earthworks. This success could not be comprehended, in particular for the non wovens, from the tests without soil, the results of which are included in the current dimensioning approaches. The results of this research study can, therefore, serve as the basis for a dimensioning approach which realistically records the influence of the soil and the deformations of the bond system.

40|$|More than {{a quarter}} of a century after the first metal {{template}} synthesis of a [2]catenane in Strasbourg, there now exists a plethora of strategies available for the construction of <b>mechanically</b> <b>bonded</b> and entwined molecular level structures. Catenanes, rotaxanes, knots and Borromean rings have all been successfully accessed by methods in which metal ions play a pivotal role. Originally metal ions were used solely for their coordination chemistry; acting either to gather and position the building blocks such that subsequent reactions generated the interlocked products or by being an integral part of the rings or "stoppers" of the interlocked assembly.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the {{engineering and development}} of a process to electrically and <b>mechanically</b> <b>bond</b> a large area, backlit charge-coupled device (CCD) sensor to a metallized substrate, using a materials system compatible with a high vacuum tube configuration. The CCD sensor is used in light sensor and digital camera devices. Currently, CCD devices are <b>mechanically</b> <b>bonded</b> to substrates {{using a variety of}} polymeric materials. For maximum resolution, however, the device must operate at high vacuum. Polymers release monomer molecules when exposed to a vacuum, since the polymerization reaction is far from equilibrium. Polymers also release retained solvent and binder molecules into a vacuum. This release of gas pollutes the high vacuum environment and degrades the tube perfomance. The CCD chip used in this research is extremely large, compared with standard semiconductor devices. The CCD chip measures 0. 4 x 0. 5 inches. At this size scale, thermal expansion mismatch stresses between die and carrier become an important design consideration, particularly for a die thinned to 10 micrometers. The proposed process results in a mechanical bond that is compatible with the high vacuum requirement, and is applicable to substrates of four possible materials: silicon, aluminum nitride, Pyrex, and LZS (a zirconia/ silicon nitride composite). The process also allows for two possible electrical connection techniques. by Joshua V. Bennett. Thesis (M. S.)
