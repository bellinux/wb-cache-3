25|$|The first {{pictures}} released of {{a nuclear}} explosion—the blast from the Trinity test—focused on the fireball itself; later pictures would focus primarily on the <b>mushroom</b> <b>cloud</b> that followed. After the United States began a regular program of nuclear testing in the late 1940s, continuing through the 1950s (and matched by the Soviet Union), the <b>mushroom</b> <b>cloud</b> {{has served as a}} symbol of the weapons themselves.|$|E
25|$|Thermonuclear explosions by {{providing}} extra material for electrical conduction {{and a very}} turbulent localized atmosphere, have been seen triggering lightning flashes within the <b>mushroom</b> <b>cloud.</b> In addition, intense gamma radiation from large nuclear explosions may develop intensely charged regions in the surrounding air through Compton scattering. The intensely charged space charge regions create multiple clear-air lightning discharges shortly after the device detonates.|$|E
25|$|For an {{explosion}} in the atmosphere, the fireball quickly expands to maximum size, and then begins to cool as it rises like a balloon through buoyancy in the surrounding air. As it does so it takes on the flow pattern of a vortex ring with incandescent material in the vortex core as seen in certain photographs. This effect is known as a <b>mushroom</b> <b>cloud.</b>|$|E
50|$|Atmospheric nuclear explosions are {{associated}} with <b>mushroom</b> <b>clouds,</b> although <b>mushroom</b> <b>clouds</b> can occur with large chemical explosions. It is possible to have an air-burst nuclear explosion without these clouds. Nuclear explosions produce radiation and radioactive debris.|$|R

25|$|High-speed {{cameras were}} placed in {{protected}} locations to capture effects of radiation and shock waves. Typical imagery from these cameras shows paint boiling off the buildings, which then are pushed away from Ground Zero by the shock wave before being drawn toward the detonation by the suction caused by the climbing <b>mushroom</b> <b>cloud.</b> Footage from these cameras has become iconic, used in various media and available {{in the public domain}} and on DVD.|$|E

25|$|O'Malley {{was born}} on January 18, 1963, in Washington, D.C., the son of Barbara (née Suelzer) and Thomas Martin O'Malley. Martin's father served as a bombardier in the U.S. Army Air Force in the Pacific theater during the Second World War, and {{recalled}} witnessing the <b>mushroom</b> <b>cloud</b> rise over Hiroshima while on a routine mission. Thomas later became a Montgomery County-based criminal defense lawyer, and an assistant United States Attorney for the District of Columbia. O'Malley's father was of Irish descent, while his mother's ancestry include Irish, German, Dutch and Scottish. He is a descendant of a War of 1812 veteran, and is {{an active member of}} the General Society of the War of 1812.He was later inducted as an honorary Colonel in the Fort McHenry Guard of reenactor soldiers at the War of 1812 historical site and park/shrine.|$|E

25|$|Energy from {{a nuclear}} {{explosive}} is initially released in several forms of penetrating radiation. When {{there is a}} surrounding material such as air, rock, or water, this radiation interacts with and rapidly heats it to an equilibrium temperature (i.e. so that the matter {{is at the same}} temperature as the atomic bomb's matter). This causes vaporization of surrounding material resulting in its rapid expansion. Kinetic energy created by this expansion contributes to the formation of a shockwave. When a nuclear detonation occurs in air near sea level, much of the released energy interacts with the atmosphere and creates a shockwave which expands spherically from the center. Intense thermal radiation at the hypocenter forms a nuclear fireball and if the burst is low enough, it is often associated with a <b>mushroom</b> <b>cloud.</b> In a burst at high altitude, where the air density is low, more energy is released as ionizing gamma radiation and x-rays than an atmosphere-displacing shockwave.|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} {{as part of}} Aedena Cycle, Berge and Brundtland {{left the}} group to form their own band, Röyksopp. The word röyksopp is a stylized version of the Norwegian word for the puffball mushroom, [...] "røyksopp". The band has stated that the word could also evoke the <b>mushroom</b> <b>cloud</b> resulting from an atomic blast.|$|E
500|$|Chain Reaction is a peace {{monument}} and public art sculpture {{composed of a}} metal framework of stainless steel and fiberglass surrounded by concrete, depicting a <b>mushroom</b> <b>cloud</b> created by a nuclear explosion.

50|$|During the 1950s, the <b>mushroom</b> <b>clouds</b> from {{atmospheric}} tests {{could be}} seen for almost 100 mi.

St. George, Utah, received the brunt of the fallout of above-ground nuclear testing in the Yucca Flats/Nevada Test Site. Winds routinely carried the fallout of these tests directly through St. George and southern Utah. Marked increases in cancers, such as leukemia, lymphoma, thyroid cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, bone cancer, brain tumors, and gastrointestinal tract cancers, were reported from the mid-1950s through 1980.|$|R

500|$|Custom {{fabricator}} Peter M.

Marked increases in cancers, such as leukemia, lymphoma, thyroid cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, bone cancer, brain tumors, and gastrointestinal tract cancers, were reported from the mid-1950s through 1980. The vast majority—828 of the 928 total nuclear tests—were underground.|$|R
50|$|High-intensity {{ionizing}} radiation in air {{can produce a}} visible ionized air glow of telltale bluish-purplish color.

500|$|... the {{sculpture}} has a disheveled quality {{akin to the}} sketch-like markings and distorted proportions [...] Paul Conrad's political cartoons...this quality is conveyed by the...treatment of the stem, the irregular placement of the links, and a subtle distortion of scale between the tall stem, its pronounced bulges, and a relatively small <b>mushroom</b> <b>cloud.</b> The ability of the large brass links to catch light and define pockets of random shadow in the small spaces between them is similar in effect to the stark treatment of light [...] dark that Conrad often employed in his political cartoons.|$|E
500|$|Radio-controlled autopilots were {{installed}} in eight B-17 bombers, converting them into remote-controlled drones {{which were then}} loaded with automatic cameras, radiation detectors, and air sample collectors. Their pilots operated them from mother planes {{at a safe distance}} from the detonations. The drones could fly into radiation environments, such as Able's <b>mushroom</b> <b>cloud,</b> which would have been lethal to crew members. All the land-based detonation-sequence photographs were taken by remote control from tall towers erected on several islands of the atoll. In all, Bikini cameras took 50,000 still pictures and [...] of motion picture film. One of the cameras could shoot 1,000 frames per second.|$|E

50|$|In 1951, {{the first}} atomic bomb {{detonation}} at the Nevada Test Site, 65 {{miles northwest of}} Las Vegas, occurred.

500|$|In the {{original}} storyboard, the Lich's lair was not {{specifically designed to}} be a subway. This was added later by the background designers. The undead skeletons that attack Finn and Jake were originally supposed to be [...] "specific undead from [...] ". However, Ward changed his mind and tasked Andy Ristaino, a character designer for the series, with stylizing the corpses. Ristaino designed them to resemble [...] "east coast commuters [...] bundled up for winter." [...] He strove to make them look like people you might see on a subway, such as a bike messenger, a couple, man in a [...] "goofy hat", and a man wearing a suit. Originally, when the Lich set off his bomb, the storyboard featured a simple <b>mushroom</b> <b>cloud.</b> Ian Jones-Quartey, one of the series' storyboard revisionists, however, added a face to the blast. Ristaino then added skulls to the smoke. The series' staff liked this version so much that they later included it on the title card.|$|E
500|$|On {{the campus}} of the University of Chicago in December 1967, 25 years to the minute after the team of {{physicists}} led by Enrico Fermi achieved the first controlled, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction, Moore's Nuclear Energy was unveiled on the site of what was once the university's football field stands, in the rackets court beneath which the experiments had taken place. This 12-foot-tall piece {{in the middle of a}} large, open plaza is often thought to represent a <b>mushroom</b> <b>cloud</b> topped by a massive human skull, but Moore's interpretation was very different. He once told a friend that he hoped viewers would [...] "go around it, looking out through the open spaces, and that they may have a feeling of being in a cathedral."

50|$|Nuclear detonations {{produced}} {{high above}} the ground might not create <b>mushroom</b> <b>clouds</b> with a stem.
