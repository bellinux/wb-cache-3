50|$|For {{the fluid}} {{responsiveness}} evaluation, {{a small amount}} of solution can be previously administered as a tester, though this <b>method</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> because it is irreversible. Another option is the passive leg raising test, which consists of inducing a fast and transient hemodynamic challenge without fluid infusion. By modifying the patient’s position, a volume of venous blood from the lower body toward the right heart it is transferred, simulating an infusion of approximately 300ml.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} methods for preparation of a sugar-based rocket propellant. Dry compression does not require heating, only the grinding of the components and then packing into the motor. However, this <b>method</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> for serious experimenting. Dry heating does not actually melt the KNO3, but it melts the sugar and then the KNO3 grains become suspended in the sugar. If you use this way of preparation always melt the sugar, remove heat source and then add the KNO3 to avoid premature ignitions. Dissolving in water, then heating the propellant to drive off the water eliminates the need to melt the components while still achieving thorough mixing.|$|E
50|$|Common ways {{to counter}} front kick are {{deflecting}} it with hand, shin, etc., stepping away/sideways, or, given the kick is visibly pointed into abdomen/thighs area, shifting a body so it passes along. The last method is somewhat risky, as it {{relies heavily on}} defender's agility, with front kick {{being one of the}} fastest kicks possible. More exotic techniques of countering front kicks exist, like one incorporated in Wado ryu kihon kumite (referred to as yakusoku, or prearranged, kumite, in some schools). Said technique involves simultaneously pushing opponents leg away from one's centerline and attacking the leg with a downward elbow strike into the hip.

50|$|Percutaneous {{drainage}} {{involves the}} guidance of a CT scan or ultrasound. A drainage catheter is placed into the fluid cavity to drain the fluid, which is then collected over several weeks into an external collection system. The catheter is removed when the drainage becomes minimal. Once the catheter is removed, contrast is injected into the cyst cavity to determine the remaining size and to monitor progress. The success rate is around 50%, and the unsuccessful drainages are mostly caused by large ductal leaks or blockage of the main pancreatic duct. This <b>method</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> when patients cannot manage a catheter at home or with patients whose cysts contain bloody or solid material.|$|E
50|$|The natural release method {{allows the}} {{pressure}} to drop slowly; this is achieved by removing the pressure cooker from the heat source and allowing {{the pressure to}} lower without action. It takes approximately 10 to 15 minutes (possibly longer) for the pressure to disappear before the lid can be opened. On many pressure cookers, a coloured indicator pin will drop when the pressure has gone. This natural release method is recommended for foods that foam and froth during cooking, such as rice, legumes, or recipes with raising agents such as steamed puddings. The texture and tenderness of meat cooked in a pressure cooker can be improved by using the natural release method. The natural release method finishes cooking foods or recipes that have longer cooking times because {{the inside of the}} pressure cooker stays hot. This <b>method</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> for foods that require very short cooking times, otherwise the food overcooks.|$|E
30|$|According to the {{screening}} result, the oil viscosity {{is too high}} for miscible gas. Immiscible gas is not considered due to the unavailability of sufficient gas. Thermal <b>method</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> due to high investment and relative high water cut. The polymer is preferably recommended for all oil zones, and the ASP is recommended for zones II–V.|$|E
30|$|The {{performance}} of the denoising methods varies depending on the noise level and the scene details inside noisy images. For example, the pixel-based bilateral filter outperforms the famous patch-based NL-Means method when denoising the Chessboard image at σ≤ 10 {{because of the large}} number of flat regions. Using pixel-based <b>methods</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> when standard deviation of a noisy image is above 40. Although promising results have been achieved by BM 3 D when denoising flat and textures scene images at high noise levels σ> 10, the {{performance of}} BM 3 D decreases when denoising images have a lot of fine details regions at σ≤ 10; see the results of Barbara and House images in Table 2.|$|R

Mixture of 6-8% polyvinyl alcohol and chalk can be used as filling material(Rhoplex WS 24 can be used too). Japanese conservators use traditional techniques, but as Urushi causes allergic reactions, these <b>methods</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended.</b> Clean it with an aliphatic hydrocarbon such as white or mineral spirits. Distilled water or saliva (moistened cottonwool swabs) can caused discoloration and should be avoided by the inexperienced: pH is crucial.

30|$|Additionally, our {{experiments}} {{indicate that}} camera calibration performed using tomographic scan of a source(s) placed in non-radioactive (cold) background may overestimate CF {{by more than}} 10 %.

40|$|Viscosity {{is a major}} {{obstacle}} in the recovery of low API gravity oil resources from heavy oil and bitumen reservoirs. While thermal recovery is usually considered the most effective method for lowering viscosity, for some reservoirs introducing heat with commonly implemented thermal <b>methods</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended.</b> For these types of reservoirs, electromagnetic heating is the recommended solution. Electromagnetic heating targets part of the reservoir instead of heating {{the bulk of the}} reservoir, which means that the targeted area can be heated up more effectively and with lower heat losses than with other thermal <b>methods.</b> Electromagnetic heating <b>is</b> still relatively new and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> widely used as an alternate or addition to traditional thermal recovery <b>methods.</b> However, studies <b>are</b> being conducted and new technologies proposed that could help increase its use.

40|$|Computational <b>methods</b> <b>are</b> used {{to predict}} the {{molecular}} consequences of amino-acid substitutions {{on the basis of}} evolutionary conservation or protein structure, but their utility in clinical diagnosis or prediction of disease outcome has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> well validated. We evaluated three popular computer programs, namely, PANTHER, SIFT and P. olyP. hen, by comparing the predicted clinical outcomes for a group of known CFTR missense mutations against the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) and clinical manifestations in cohorts of subjects with CF-disease and CFTR-related disorders carrying these mutations. Owing to poor specificity, none of tools reliably distinguished between individual mutations that confer CF disease from mutations found in subjects with a CFTR-related disorder or no disease. Prediction scores for CFTR mutations derived from PANTHER showed a significant overall statistical correlation with the spectrum of disease severity associated with mutations in the CFTR gene. In contrast, P. olyP. hen- and SIFT-derived scores only showed significant differences between CF-causing and non-CF variants. Current computational <b>methods</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> for establishing or excluding a CF diagnosis, notably as a newborn screening strategy or in patients with equivocal test results. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|As {{copper and}} nickel alloy {{with each other}} easily and have simple structures, the alloys are ductile and readily fabricated. Strength and {{hardness}} for each individual alloy is increased by cold working; they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> hardened by heat treatment. Joining of 90-10 (C70600) and 70-30 (C71500) is possible by both welding or brazing. They are both weldable {{by the majority of}} techniques, although autogenous (welding without weld consumables) or oxyacetylene <b>methods</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended.</b> The 70-30 rather than 90-10 weld consumables are normally preferred for both alloys and no after-welding heat treatment is required. They can also be welded directly to steel, providing a 65% nickel-copper weld consumable is used to avoid iron dilution effects. The C71640 alloy tends to be used as seamless tubing and expanded rather than welded into the tube plate. Brazing requires appropriate silver-base brazing alloys. However, great care must be taken to ensure that there are no stresses in the Cu-Ni being silver brazed, since any stress can cause intergranulary penetration of the brazing material, and severe stress cracking (see image). Thus, full annealing of any potential mechanical stress is necessary.|$|R
