A Baltic Surveys (Baltijos Tyrimai) face-to-face interview survey for the eurosceptic Europeans United for Democracy party conducted on 14–24 November found that 49% of Lithuanians disagree with their Government’s decision to introduce the euro, while 26% of Lithuanians approved (5% fully, 21% rather in favour). 57% of respondents said the Government acted wrongly by introducing the euro without a referendum on the issue. However, a poll conducted by Berent Research Baltic for the Bank of Lithuania between 3 and 26 November showed that 53% of the population were in favour of the new currency while 39% were sceptical.|$|E

Actually determining and counting {{the number of}} homeless is very difficult in general due to their lifestyle habits. There are so-called [...] "hidden homeless" [...] {{out of sight of the}} normal population and perhaps staying on private property. Various countries, states, and cities have come up with differing means and techniques to calculate an approximate count.

30|$|In {{past ten}} years, {{a large number}} of papers have been devoted to {{dynamical}} properties in non-autonomous discrete systems. Kolyada and Snoha [1] gave the definition of topological entropy in non-autonomous discrete systems; Kolyada et al. [13] discussed minimality of non-autonomous discrete systems; Kempf [14] and Canovas [15] studied ω-limit sets in non-autonomous discrete systems. Krabs [16] discussed stability in non-autonomous discrete systems; Huang et al. [17, 18] studied topological pressure and pre-image entropy of non-autonomous discrete systems. Shi and Chen [19] and Oprocha and Wilczynski [20] and Canovas [21] discussed chaos in non-autonomous discrete systems, respectively. Kuang and Cheng [22] studied fractal entropy of non-autonomous systems. In this paper, we extend the notions of weakly <b>mixing</b> <b>set</b> and transitive set and give the definitions of transitive <b>set</b> and weakly <b>mixing</b> <b>set</b> for a non-autonomous discrete system. We discuss the basic properties of weakly <b>mixing</b> <b>sets</b> and transitive sets for non-autonomous discrete systems. Moreover, we investigate the weakly <b>mixing</b> <b>sets</b> and transitive sets for the conjugated non-autonomous discrete systems and obtain that if a system has a transitive <b>set</b> (a weakly <b>mixing</b> <b>set),</b> then the conjugated system has a transitive <b>set</b> (a weakly <b>mixing</b> <b>set).</b>|$|R

40|$|We explore {{one method}} for finding the convex hull of certain <b>mixed</b> integer <b>sets.</b> The {{approach}} is {{to break up the}} original set into a small number of subsets, find a compact polyhedral description of the convex hull of each subset, and then take the convex hull of the union of these polyhedra. The resulting extended formulation is then compact, its projection is the convex hull of the original set, and optimization over the <b>mixed</b> integer <b>set</b> is reduced to solving a linear program over the extended formulation. The approach is demonstrated on three different sets: a continuous <b>mixing</b> <b>set</b> with an upper bound and a <b>mixing</b> <b>set</b> with two divisible capacities both arising in lot-sizing, and a single node flow model with divisible capacities that arises as a subproblem in network design. <b>mixed</b> integer <b>sets,</b> convex hull, unions of polyhedra, lot-sizing...|$|R

How did the two sets of objects come to be all mixed up together, in an old hill fort, at Dunbuie on Clyde; and among the wooden foundations of two mysterious structures, excavated in the mud of the Clyde estuary at Dumbuck and Langbank, near Dumbarton? They were dug up between 1896 and 1902.|$|E

He has, and continued always to have, not unmixed with fear, a real admiration for Friedrich, that terrible practical Doer, with the cutting brilliances of mind and character, and the irrefragable common sense; nay he has even a kind of love to him, or something like it,--love made up of gratitude for past favors, and lively anticipation of future. Voltaire is, by nature, an attached or attachable creature; flinging out fond boughs to every kind of excellence, and especially holding firm by old ties he had made. One fancies in him a <b>mixed</b> <b>set</b> of emotions, direct and reflex,--the consciousness of safe shelter, were there nothing more; of glory to oneself, derived and still derivable from this high man:--in fine, a sum-total of actual desire to live with King Friedrich, which might, surely, have almost sufficed even for Voltaire, in a quieter element.
