5|$|Ferraro {{had felt}} unusually tired {{at the end}} of her second senate campaign. In , she was {{diagnosed}} with multiple <b>myeloma,</b> a form of blood cancer where plasma cells secrete abnormal antibodies known as Bence-Jones proteins, which can cause bones to disintegrate and dump toxic amounts of calcium into the bloodstream. She did not publicly disclose the illness until , when she went to Washington to successfully press in Congressional hearings for passage of the Hematological Cancer Research Investment and Education Act. A portion of the Act created the Geraldine Ferraro Cancer Education Program, which directs the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish an education program for patients of blood cancers and the general public. Ferraro became a frequent speaker on the disease, and an avid supporter and honorary board member of the Multiple <b>Myeloma</b> Research Foundation.|$|E

50|$|Also <b>myelomas</b> often {{constitute}} a diagnostic challenge. The malignant cells {{are often not}} available for microscopic analysis, and the prognosis is often uncertain.

40|$|We have {{assessed}} {{the number of}} times the gene sequence encoding constant regions of mouse immunoglobulin heavy chains gamma 1, gamma 2 a, and gamma 3 are represented in the mouse genome by hybridization kinetic analysis. All three genes are present at one copy each per haploid genome in normal tissues and <b>myelomas</b> producing IgM or IgG 3. IgG 1 -producing <b>myelomas,</b> however, contain 1 copy each of the gamma 1 and gamma 2 a genes and 0. 5 copy of the gamma 3 gene per haploid genome. IgG 2 b-producing <b>myelomas</b> contain 1 copy of the gamma 2 a gene and 0. 5 copy each of the gamma 1 and gamma 3 genes per haploid genome. IgG 2 a-producing <b>myelomas</b> contain 1 copy of the gamma 2 a gene and 0. 5 copy each of the gamma 1 and gamma 3 genes per haploid genome. In <b>myelomas</b> producing IgA, all three gamma genes are represented 0. 5 times per haploid genome. In order to account for the results we propose an allelic deletion model: (i) The specific deletion of heavy chain constant region genes accompanies the recombination of a variable region gene to a constant region gene. (ii) The portion of the chromosome that resides between two joining sequences is excised out of the chromosome. (iii) The recombination occurs on one of the alleles. Based on this model we also propose that heavy chain genes are arranged on one chromosome in the following order; variable region genes, unknown spacer sequence, mu, gamma 3, gamma 1, gamma 2 b, gamma 2 a, and alpha...|$|R

5|$|In 1976, {{thousands}} of inhabitants of Seveso, Italy {{were exposed to}} TCDD after an accidental release of several kilograms of TCDD from a pressure tank. A number of animals died, and high concentrations of TCDD, up to 56,000 pg/g of fat, were noted especially in children playing outside and eating local food. The acute effects were limited to about 200 cases of chloracne. Long-term effects seem to include a slight excess of multiple <b>myeloma</b> and myeloid leukaemia, {{as well as some}} developmental effects such as disturbed development of teeth and excess of girls born to fathers who were exposed as children. Several other long-term effects have been suspected, but the evidence is not very strong.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Reynolds {{fell ill}} with {{multiple}} <b>myeloma,</b> {{a type of}} blood cancer that often attacks the bones, {{and was forced to}} stop anchoring in April. His absence caused a dip in the ratings for ABC's nightly newscast. ABC originally expected a full recovery, and relocated Jennings to its Washington bureau to fill in for Reynolds while he was sick; the move helped buoy the newscast's ratings, though it remained in third place. On July 20, 1983, Reynolds died unexpectedly after developing acute hepatitis.|$|E

40|$|Ceruloplasmin (132 kDa) is a copper-binding protein which {{functions}} as an anti-oxidant in the blood. Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies specific {{to a single}} antigen. Antibody producing lymphocytes were fused with <b>myelomas</b> to generate hybridomas which both produce antibody and survive in vitro. A polyethylene glycol fusion procedure was used to fuse splenocytes from a ceruloplasmin immunized BALB/c mouse and murine <b>myelomas</b> (P 3 cell line also of BALB/c origin). Thes hybridomas were screened with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using commercially available ceruloplasmin. A single hybridoma cell line producing monoclonal antibody specific to ceruloplasmin, a “ceruloplasminoma,” was isolated in this manner. Spectrophotometric analysis confirmed the specificity of this monoclonal antibody in inhibiting the oxidase activity of ceruloplasmin...|$|R
5|$|In {{studies of}} {{molecular}} and cellular biology {{it is often}} desirable to artificially induce fusion. The addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) causes fusion without significant aggregation or biochemical disruption. This procedure is now used extensively, for example by fusing B-cells with <b>myeloma</b> cells. The resulting “hybridoma” from this combination expresses a desired antibody {{as determined by the}} B-cell involved, but is immortalized due to the melanoma component. Fusion can also be artificially induced through electroporation in a process known as electrofusion. It is believed that this phenomenon results from the energetically active edges formed during electroporation, which can act as the local defect point to nucleate stalk growth between two bilayers.|$|E

40|$|Whereas mouse <b>myelomas</b> that secrete IgA half-molecules {{have been}} shown to arise in vivo, their origin has not been {{definitely}} established. We show that somatic variants secreting phenotypically similar molecules can arise directly from the normal IgA-secreting <b>myelomas</b> S 107 and W 3082. In addition to being improperly assembled, the variant proteins have distinct carboxy-terminal deletions and an aberrant heavy-light chain disulfide bond. For {{at least one of the}} variants, variable region serology and affinity for hapten are both unaffected by these changes. Southern and Northern blot analyses indicate normal size DNA restriction fragments and mRNA, suggesting premature termination as the mechanism of deletion. These results are discussed in relation to possible mutational hot spots and long-range interdomain interactions...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY-Seven thymus-derived lymphomas {{in culture}} were inhibited, as {{measured}} by RNA or DNA synthesis, by low concentrations of phytohemagglutinin {PHA), a T-cell mitogen; 8 <b>myelomas</b> were re-sistant to PHA. Both classes of tumors grown in fetal calf serum were inhibited by concanavalin A (Con A), another T-cell mitogen. Higher concentrations of Con A were required to affect cell lines in horse serum, and lymphomas were generally more sensitive than <b>myelomas.</b> Pokeweed mitogen and the B-cell mitogen Salmonella typhosa lipopolysaccharide, at concentrations which stimulate lymphocytes to divide, {{did not affect the}} tumors. All cell lines were sensitive to ricin, and some IgG 2 a <b>myelomas</b> were selectively sensitive to extracts of U 1 ex europeus. Inhibition of cellular DNA or RNA synthesis by PHA was blocked by N-acetyl-galactosamine, inhibition by Con A was blocked by methyl-mannoside, and inhibition by ricin was blocked by galactose and partially by N-acetyl-galactosamine. These lectin effects provide alternative markers to cell-surface differentiation antigens for the characterization of T and B lymphocytes and tumors. -J Natl Cancer Inst 51 : 883 - 890, 1973.
