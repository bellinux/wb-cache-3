5|$|As for The Five, {{the group}} had long since dispersed, Mussorgsky had died in 1881 and Borodin had {{followed}} in 1887. Cui continued to write negative reviews of Tchaikovsky's <b>music</b> <b>but</b> was seen by the composer as merely a critical irritant. Balakirev lived in isolation and was confined to the musical sidelines. Only Rimsky-Korsakov remained fully active as a composer.|$|E
5|$|Bryars {{approached}} Blake Morrison in May 1988 {{with the}} suggestion of working on an opera based on Verne's novella. At the time Morrison knew neither the Verne story nor Bryars's <b>music</b> <b>but</b> he agreed to the proposal after a lunchtime meeting with the composer. They worked together on a concert piece which was premiered as Doctor Ox's Experiment (Epilogue) by the soprano Sarah Leonard and the Gavin Bryars Ensemble in November 1988.|$|E
5|$|Def Jam {{rented out}} nearly every {{recording}} studio in Los Angeles {{in order to}} create as many songs as possible. Ray Daniels, the manager of musical duo Rock City (brothers Theron and Timothy Thomas), was present during the sessions, and stated that a writing camp typically involves the label hiring ten recording studios for two weeks at the cost of $25,000 per day. Daniels revealed that it is where songwriters have lyrics but no music, and where producers have <b>music</b> <b>but</b> no lyrics.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{essentially}} African American {{nature of}} ragtime, {{it is most}} commonly considered the first style of American popular music to be truly black music; ragtime brought syncopation and a more authentic black sound to popular music. Popular ragtime songs were notated and sold as sheet <b>music,</b> <b>but</b> the general style was played more informally across the nation; these amateur performers played a more free-flowing form of ragtime that eventually became a major formative influence on jazz.|$|E
5|$|He is ambidextrous, and {{had trouble}} {{differentiating}} {{between right and}} left, which affected his football games as a boy. He uses his right hand to draw and color and his left hand to write. He typically kicks with his right leg in Sweet Chin <b>Music,</b> <b>but</b> uses either arm for his signature elbow drop, depending on position.|$|E
5|$|His mother {{played the}} piano {{reasonably}} well and wanted her son to learn the violin, not only to instill in him a love of <b>music</b> <b>but</b> also to help him assimilate into German culture.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the film itself, the soundtrack received several nominations for various awards. The score won the Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture or for Television.

5|$|In concert bands, {{clarinets}} are {{an important}} part of the instrumentation. The E clarinet, B clarinet, alto clarinet, bass clarinet, and contra-alto/contrabass clarinet are commonly used in concert bands. Concert bands generally have multiple B clarinets; there are commonly 3 B clarinet parts with 2–3 players per part. There is generally only one player per part on the other clarinets. There are not always E clarinet, alto clarinet, and contra-alto clarinets/contrabass clarinet parts in concert band <b>music,</b> <b>but</b> all three are quite common.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{critics also}} {{mentioned}} its presentation. Stella praised the visuals {{and enjoyed the}} music despite it sounding dated, while Hatfield praised the <b>music</b> <b>but</b> criticized the graphics as uninspired. Reddick praised the visual overhaul, despite limited animation for sprites outside battle. Dutton echoed Hatfield's sentiments about the visuals, finding them one of his main criticisms of the presentation alongside the dialogue.|$|E

5|$|The Janáček Philharmonic Orchestra was {{established}} in 1954.

The orchestra tours extensively and has performed in Europe, the U.S., Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Its current music director is Theodore Kuchar.|$|E
5|$|The Penguin Jazz Guide {{commented that}} Hope's {{compositions}} were strongly melodic, with some containing concepts of fugue and canon taken from classical <b>music,</b> <b>but</b> retaining foundations in the blues. Atkins stated that Hope wrote highly structured, complex compositions that {{he played with}} improvisational flexibility. Mathieson pointed out that, despite the originality of Hope's compositions, they have been taken up by other musicians only rarely, as they are tied to Hope's idiosyncratic form of expression and remain difficult to play.|$|E

5|$|The fiddle, and {{traditional}} music in general, remained popular in Donegal {{not only because}} of the international coverage of certain artists but because of local pride in the music. Traditional music Seisiúns are still common place both in pubs and in houses. The Donegal fiddle music has been influenced by recorded <b>music,</b> <b>but</b> this is claimed to have had a positive impact on the tradition. Modern Donegal fiddle music is often played in concerts and recorded on albums.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} {{received}} generally favorable reviews, with reviewers liking the story, writing, character designs and <b>music,</b> <b>but</b> with some criticizing {{the lack of}} new gameplay mechanics.

5|$|A horse's {{hearing is}} good, and the pinna of each ear can rotate up to 180°, giving the {{potential}} for 360° hearing without having to move the head. Noise impacts the behavior of horses and certain kinds of noise may contribute to stress: A 2013 study in the UK indicated that stabled horses were calmest in a quiet setting, or if listening to country or classical <b>music,</b> <b>but</b> displayed signs of nervousness when listening to jazz or rock music. This study also recommended keeping music under a volume of 21 decibels. An Australian study found that stabled racehorses listening to talk radio had {{a higher rate of}} gastric ulcers than horses listening to music, and racehorses stabled where a radio was played had a higher overall rate of ulceration than horses stabled where there was no radio playing.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{initiative}} {{came from}} Norman Pierre Gentieu (1914–2009), an American writer who discovered Sorabji by reading his book Around Music {{just after the}} Second World War. Because of the post-war shortages in England, Gentieu sent Sorabji some provisions, {{and the depth of}} their friendship appears to have been such that he continued to do so for the next four decades. In the early 1950s Gentieu made an offer to Sorabji to pay for the microfilming of his major piano works and to give some copies to selected libraries. All of his unpublished musical manuscripts were eventually microfilmed. Gentieu also sent Sorabji a tape recorder to record some of his <b>music,</b> <b>but</b> Sorabji did not do so.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with their}} third album, Master of Reality, Black Sabbath began to feature tuned-down guitars. In 1965, before forming Black Sabbath, guitarist Tony Iommi {{suffered}} an accident {{while working in}} a sheet metal factory, losing the tips of two fingers on his right hand. Iommi almost gave up <b>music,</b> <b>but</b> was urged by the factory manager to listen to Django Reinhardt, a jazz guitarist who lost the use of two fingers in a fire. Inspired by Reinhardt, Iommi created two thimbles made of plastic and leather to cap off his missing fingertips. The guitarist began using lighter strings, and detuning his guitar, to better grip the strings with his prosthesis. Early in the band's history Iommi experimented with different dropped tunings, including C tuning, or 3 semitones down, before settling on E/D tuning, or a half-step down from standard tuning.|$|E
