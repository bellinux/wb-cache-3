40|$|This {{report is}} an {{empirical}} {{analysis of the}} effectiveness of the marketing/promotion, nonagricultural research, and agricultural research activities associated with the cotton checkoff program over the period of 1986 / 87 through 2004 / 05. The analysis is based on a multi-equation, econometric, non-spatial, price equilibrium simulation model of U. S. and foreign fiber markets using annual data. The key average annual impacts of the cotton checkoff program on U. S. and foreign cotton and <b>man-made</b> <b>fiber</b> markets and their associated textile markets are reported. The results show that the returns to cotton producers as well as to cotton importers from the cotton checkoff program are positive. The average discounted benefit-cost ratios (BCR) for the cotton checkoff program were found to be 5. 7 for domestic cotton producers and 14. 4 for importers. The higher BCR for importers reflects revenue gains not only from additional sales of cotton fiber textiles but also from additional “spillover” sales of <b>man-made</b> <b>fiber</b> textiles prompted by the cotton checkoff program. The results also show that U. S. taxpayers are better off because the cotton checkoff program has tended to reduce government outlays directed to cotton farmers. The analysis also finds that neither U. S. producers nor importers pay the full cost of the checkoff assessments. Finally, cotton checkoff expenditures on agricultural research were found to have positively and significantly affected U. S. cotton yields with no discernible effects on cotton harvested acreage.

40|$|Chinese {{synthetic}} fiber capacity {{is more than}} 100 times larger than it was just 30 years ago. It represents more capacity than exists in the United States and Western Europe combined and continues to expand each year to serve the growing Chinese textile industry. Historically, the Chinese government has provided support to the {{synthetic fiber}} industry and encouraged its expansion. At the same time, petroleum consumption in China continues to expand, and China is now the second largest petroleum consumer in the world. As a byproduct of petroleum distillation, the feeder materials for synthetic fiber production are readily available in the marketplace. In the presence of inter-fiber competition, {{the large amount of}} synthetic production capacity may have consequences for world cotton consumption and prices. With changes in Chinese government support to the synthetic fiber industry or other changes in the demand for synthetic capacity, there is the potential for indirect consequences on cotton fiber markets. Using a structural econometric model of inter-fiber competition, such impacts are investigated. <b>Man-made</b> <b>fiber</b> production is handled in a unique fashion, with capacity and utilization rates estimated separately to determine production. Models of <b>man-made</b> <b>fiber</b> markets in China, Japan, and Taiwan as well as the United States will help to more fully represent the market for man-made fibers. The world cotton market is covered with country level models for all countries of primary importance in the natural fibers markets with the remainder of the world broken up into regional blocks. The model includes relevant input prices at the mill level to reflect inter-fiber competition, and therefore contains the most important factors determining cotton production, prices and trade. To simulate a reduction of subsidization provided to the synthetic fiber industry by the Chinese government, changes in Chinese synthetic capacity are imposed to determine the impact on world cotton markets.

40|$|This article {{tests the}} {{anti-competitive}} effect of trade restrictions under the Multi-Fiber Arrangement in the U. S. textile industry. The modeling approach {{differs from that}} of traditional empirical studies. That is, it allows for non-competitive behavior by domestic firms and therefore permits estimating the effect of trade policy on domestic firms' conduct, market power, and profit margins. The model is estimated for several selected product categories of the U. S. textile industry. Empirical results indicate that trade restrictions enabled domestic producers to behave less competitively and raise their profit margins. The empirical evidence is significant in the <b>man-made</b> <b>fiber</b> sub-sectors. The anti-competitive effect, however, tended to taper off over time, suggesting that higher profits might have induced new entry and hence boosted competition.

The biodegradation of the three samples were evaluated at 35 ℃ for 42 days by the time-dependent changes in weight loss, strength loss and morphology in both conditions. The experimental results indicate that biodegradation activities in natural soil was more efficient and faster than that in aqueous medium; The order of their degradation rates are: cotton>wool>PLA fiber, that implies the natural fibers are more easily degradable than man-made biodegradable PLA fiber; and the mechanical properties decreased faster than biodegradation rate. The disposal of the fibers used in textiles is a serious challenge to waste management.

Not only the chemical structure of the surface is modified using different plasma gases but also the topography of the surface. A highly hydrophobic surface with a particular sur-face topography in contact with water is extremely dust- and dirt-repellent and hence should be also repellent to bacteria and fungi. <b>Man-made</b> <b>fibers</b> to be used under chemical stress are modified with diffusion-barrier layers on their surfaces without modifying the bulk properties; hence, the stability of those fibers is significantly improved...|$|R

In addition, {{in the preparation of}} shape memory polyurethane fiber, the effect of thermal setting temperature was systematically investigated by mechanical properties testing, DMA and cyclic tensile testing, suggesting that the thermal setting temperature has a huge influence on the mechanical properties and shape memory property due to the elimination of internal stress. Thermal setting with a higher temperature will give rise to a lower tensile modulus and tenacity and a higher elongation ratio at break. Through employing the optimal thermal setting treatment, the complete heating responsive recovery in SMPU fiber can be achieved because of the counteracting effect of the irreversible strain and thermal shrinkage.
