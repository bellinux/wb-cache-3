Biodegradable stockings were packed with spat and tied to parallel rows of looped ropes, supported by buoys. Young mussels grow through the stockings, anchoring themselves to the ropes with their strong byssal threads (beards). The farms are usually located in sheltered or semi-sheltered areas where there is sufficient depth of water at low tide to keep the longline droppers off the bottom.

2500|$|Marine {{nutrient}} bioextraction is {{the practice}} of farming and harvesting marine organisms such as shellfish and seaweed {{for the purpose of}} reducing nutrient pollution. Mussels and other bivalve shellfish consume phytoplankton containing nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). [...] On average, one live mussel is 1.0% N and 0.1% P. When the mussels are harvested and removed, these nutrients are also removed from the system and recycled in the form of seafood or mussel biomass, which can be used as an organic fertilizer or animal feed-additive. These ecosystem services provided by mussels are of particular interest to those hoping to mitigate excess anthropogenic marine nutrients, particularly in eutrophic marine systems. [...] While mussel aquaculture is actually promoted in some countries such as Sweden as a water management strategy to address coastal eutrophication, <b>mussel</b> <b>farming</b> as a nutrient mitigation tool {{is still in its infancy}} in most parts of the world.

2500|$|Norfolk has a {{long history}} of human {{occupation}} dating back to the Palaeolithic, and including significant archaeology. Both modern and Neanderthal people were present in the area between 100,000 and 10,000years ago, before the last glaciation, and humans returned as the ice retreated northwards. The archaeological record is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly because of the then prevailing very cold conditions, but also because the coastline was much further north than at present. As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic (10,000–5,000BCE), the sea level rose, filling what is now the North Sea. This brought the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line, [...] so that many ancient sites are now under the sea in an area now known as Doggerland. Early Mesolithic flint tools with characteristic long blades up to [...] long found on the present-day coast at nearby Titchwell Marsh date from a time when it was [...] from the sea. Other flint tools have been found dating from the Upper Paleolithic (50,000–10,000BCE) to the Neolithic (5,000–2,500BCE). Deposits of peat between layers of marine or salt marsh sediments date from 1980–1780BC, indicating that the sea had retreated, leaving this area as dry land during that era.

40|$|We {{studied the}} impact of organic loads due to the biodeposition of a <b>mussel</b> <b>farm</b> in a coastal area of the Tyrrhenian Sea (Western Mediterranean).

Benthic response {{to changes in the}} biodepositional regime was investigated in terms of biochemical composition of the sedimentary organic matter, phytopigment content, bacterial abundance and composition and meiofaunal community structure. A large accumulation of chloroplastic pigments, proteins and lipids was observed under the <b>mussel</b> <b>farm.</b> Such changes in the sedimentary conditions reflected the accumulation of faeces and pseudo-faeces and {{led to the creation of}} reducing conditions. Microbial assemblages beneath the mussel cultures increased their densities and displayed, when compared to the control, a larger cyanobacterial importance associated to a strong decrease of the picoeukaryotic cell density. Farm sediments displayed significant changes in meiofaunal density: turbellarian, ostracod and kinorhynch densities decreased significantly, while copepods remained constant or increased possibly profiting of the enrichment in microphytobenthic biomass associated to mussel biodeposits. The comparative analysis of the mussel biodeposition and fish-farm impact on sediments beneath the cultures revealed that <b>mussel</b> <b>farms</b> induced a considerably lower disturbance on benthic community structure.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{commonly}} employed methods of reducing damage by diving ducks to mussel stocks on <b>mussel</b> <b>farms</b> in Atlantic Canada and in Scotland is chasing birds by boat. While effective in the short term. the frequency of chases is often restricted by high costs. both in time and furl. Tests in Scotland used underwater recordings of chase-boat engines replayed at regular intervals on continuous loop tapes through on underwater loudspeaker in an attempt to reduce predation pressure by elders on <b>mussel</b> <b>farms.</b> Trials of the underwater playback system (UPS) gave significant reductions in eider numbers of 50 - 80 % while a control trial with the playback of an unassociated noise gave no reduction in numbers. The mean return time of birds to the farm after chasing by boat also increased significantly. As the presence of workers on <b>mussel</b> <b>farms</b> reduces the number of eiders feeding there, the UPS is a useful deterrent when workers are not present. The long-term habituation of ducks to the system was negligible when workers are absent, providing there is occasionally reinforcement of the deterrent by boat chasing.

40|$|Growing {{numbers and}} {{increased}} stocking of marine <b>mussel</b> <b>farms</b> make reliable techniques for environmental effect assessment a priority. Previously, we showed how the color intensity of soft sediment {{could be used}} to estimate its acid volatile sulfide (AVS) content, a product of the anaerobic microbial degradation of organic matter deposits. We then proposed to include assessments of the AVS farm footprint in marine farm monitoring, in particular, to investigate temporal changes in the extent of the seafloor area of elevated sediment AVS content. Such assessment requires accurate detection of the AVS footprint boundary. Here, we demonstrate how to detect this boundary with analyses of sediment color intensity. We analyzed 182 sediment profile images taken along three transects leading from approximately 50 m inside to 200 m outside a long-line <b>mussel</b> <b>farm</b> in New Zealand and found that the mean sediment color intensity inside the farm boundary was almost one third lower than that of the sediment distant from the farm. Segmented regression analysis of the combined color intensity data revealed a breakpoint in the trend of increasing grey values with increasing distance from the farm at 56 ± 13 m (± 95 % confidence interval of the breakpoint) outside the <b>mussel</b> <b>farm.</b> Mapping of grey value data with ArcMap (ESRI, ArcGIS) indicated that the extent of the color intensity footprint is a function of water column depth; organic particles disperse further in a deeper seawater column. We conclude that for soft coastal sediments, our sampling and data analysis techniques may provide a rapid and reliable supplement to existing benthic surveys that assess environmental effects of <b>mussel</b> <b>farms...</b>|$|R
40|$|Field {{studies were}} carried out to {{determine}} and compare the impact of organic loads due to the biodeposition of a <b>mussel</b> <b>farm</b> on the water quality and sediment in a coastal area of the Tyrrhenian Sea (Western Mediterranean). A total of five environmental and five microbial parameters were examined from March, 1997 to February, 1998 on a monthly basis at three stations: the first was located under the <b>mussel</b> <b>farm,</b> the second located at about 40 m away from the <b>mussel</b> <b>farm,</b> while the third designed as a control was at about 1 -km. No clear changes in the physical characteristics of the water masses were observed, comparing the three sampling sites and the water column generally showed homogeneous conditions (in terms of temperature and salinity). Changes in density of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria, Escherichia coli and Enterococci in the water column are apparently independent from changes in environmental parameters. At all stations a constant significant correlation between temperature and presumptive Vibrio parahaemolyticus was reported suggesting that this abiotic factor exerted a major control on this bacterial group and its distribution in the water column is not related to the biodeposition of the <b>mussel</b> <b>farm.</b> The major impact identified was on the sediment where variations in bacterial abundance was observed. In the Mussel station sediment enrichment of organic compounds, and the consequent modification of the characteristics of the benthic environment, determined an increase in aerobic heterotrophic bacteria, and particularly of vibrios density (on average about 60 %), suggesting that these bacteria are good indicators of organic enrichment. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|We {{investigated}} and compared {{the impact of}} organic loads due to the biodeposition of <b>mussel</b> and fish <b>farms</b> on the water column of a coastal area of the Tyrrhenian Sea (Western Mediterranean). Physico-chemical data (including oxygen, nutrients, DOC and particulate organic matter), microbial variables (picoplankton and picophytoplankton density and biomass) and phytoplankton biomass (as chlorophyll-a) were determined {{on a monthly basis}} from March 1997 to February 1998. The results {{of this study indicate that}} both fish <b>farm</b> and <b>mussel</b> culture did not alter significantly dissolved inorganic phosphorus and chlorophyll-a values, while inorganic nitrogen concentrations were higher in <b>mussel</b> <b>farm</b> area. However, waters overlying the fish farm presented significantly higher DOC concentrations. In contrast, no significant differences were observed comparing particulate matter concentrations. The increased DOC concentrations determined a response of the heterotrophic fraction of picoplankton, while picophytoplankton, likewise phytoplankton, did not display differences among fish or <b>mussel</b> <b>farms</b> and control site. From the analysis of the different microbial components, it is possible to conclude that the impact of fish farms is evident only for the heterotrophic components. The comparative analysis of the mussel biodeposition and fish-farm impact revealed that <b>mussel</b> <b>farms</b> induced a considerably lower disturbance, apparently limited to an increased density and biomass of microbial assemblages beneath the mussel cultures.
