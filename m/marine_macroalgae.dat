Geomyces pannorum has also been recovered from glacier bank soils in Kashmir, India, at an elevation of over 3000 metres, where temperatures rarely exceed 10 °C. This species can survive in arctic cryopegs consisting of super-cooled hypersaline liquid water deposits found beneath or within large masses of ice. Geomyces pannorum has also been associated with Antarctic <b>marine</b> <b>macroalgae</b> and deep-sea ecosystems. It {{is one of the most}} common fungi isolated in these environments, which suggests that they are involved in decomposition and nutrient-cycling in cold marine ecosystems. Geomyces pannorum is tolerant of up to three times the salinity of seawater. This fungus maintains cell and membrane function at low temperatures by elevating levels of unsaturated fats and compounds with cryoprotectant properties such as trehalose and various polyols. The enzyme systems also retain function at low temperature.|$|E
50|$|The Macrocystis {{are one of}} {{the largest}} types of <b>marine</b> <b>macroalgae,</b> the species can grow to lengths of 50 meters, forming undersea forests in hard-bottom, subtidal areas. Attached to the bottom by {{branched}} holdfasts, the algae grow up to the surface in the form of columns made of several dozen interwoven cords. They then spread out widely on the surface thanks to floaters placed at the base of multiple slings similar to corrugated sheets. The kelp can cover wide areas where navigation is practically impossible because the thin straps can get entangled in ships' propellers and block them. The kelp forests in the Kerguelen Islands are home to relatively few vertebrates but many colourful invertebrates as well as a great diversity of red algae. The storms regularly tear off large quantities of giant algae that wash ashore and rot on the beaches {{in the form of a}} mattress which can reach several meters thickness. These wash-ups of algae form one of the essential bases of the local ecosystem.|$|E

In the general structure of (Glu-Cys) (n) -Gly for PC, the n value was less than 3 for this alga. Algal PC-Cd complexes existed in the high molecular weight and low molecular weight forms. The high molecular weight form is rich in acid-labile sulfide. The PC content in algal fronds was directly correlated with the ambient Cd concentration as well as exposure time.

Methods: The animals were separated into groups and STZ (55 mg/kg body weight) {{was used to}} induce diabetics. Glucose, HbA 1 c, insulin, C-peptide levels and in vivo antioxidant levels were estimated and histopathological studies were done in STZ-induced diabetic and <b>marine</b> <b>macroalgae</b> treated rats. Results: Based on glucose and HbA 1 c levels and in vivo antioxidant levels, among the 31 <b>marine</b> <b>macroalgae</b> extracts, FM 4 has showed high anti-diabetic activity. Hence, FM 4 was purified and characterized by 1 H-NMR spectra and FT-IR as sulphated galactopyran. During the survival analysis, SGP at dose of 100 mg/kg showed significant (P < 0. 05) survival rate and elevations in C-peptide and insulin levels. The histopathological modulations of SGP were observed in diabetic rat tissues such as liver, kidney and brain. Hence obtained results reveal that SGP treated diabetic rats has significant changes in C-peptide and insulin levels which regulates the blood glucose levels and recovered the histopathological changes.

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is a {{group of}} chronic metabolic disorders characterized by hyperglycemia due to defects in insulin action and/or secretion. It is a worldwide problem which has led to illness and premature mortality for many people, and the number of diabetes cases has been rising sharply. Unluckily, many conventional antidiabetic agents either show limited efficacy or serious mechanism-based side effects. <b>Marine</b> <b>macroalgae</b> possess tremendous nutritional value and have been well-known to cure and prevent diabetes. An increased interest in various bioactive natural products from <b>marine</b> <b>macroalgae,</b> as a potential source of effective antidiabetic agents, has been observed in recent years. The effects of macroalgae may delay the development of diabetes and alter the metabolic abnormalities through various mechanisms of actions. This review provides an overview of <b>marine</b> <b>macroalgae</b> used to prevent and manage diabetes and explores the hypoglycemic properties of macroalgae-derived bioactive compounds such as polyphenol, bromophenols, sulfated polysaccharides, fucoidan, fucosterol, phlorotannins, carotenoid pigments and fucoxanthin with their probable mechanisms behind hypoglycemic activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{cytotoxic}} drug, cisplatin (cis-PtCl(2) (NH(3)) (2)), {{has been}} added to cultures of the <b>marine</b> <b>macroalga,</b> Ulva lactuca, under various experimental conditions. Both accumulation and internalisation over a 48 h period was greater when cisplatin was added to coastal sea water (salinity = 33) from a distilled water solution than when added to either sea water or estuarine water (salinity = 16. 5) from a saline solution. This effect is attributed to the greater abundance of the more reactive monoaqua complex (cis-PtCl(OH(2)) (NH(3)) (2) (+)) in the distilled water solution and kinetic constraints on its conversion back to cis-PtCl(2) (NH(3)) (2) in sea water.

An immediate (< 2 h) toxic effect was elicited under all experimental conditions that was quantitatively related to the concentration of contaminated particles present. Likewise, the rate of leaching of both Cu and Zn was correlated with the concentration of paint particles added. Copper accumulation by the alga increased linearly with aqueous Cu concentration, largely through adsorption to the cell surface, but significant accumulation of Zn was not observed.

40|$|The {{history of}} a domesticated <b>marine</b> <b>macroalga</b> is studied using archaeological, phylogeographic and {{population}} genetic tools. Phylogeographic and population genetic analyses demonstrated that the cultivated red alga Gracilaria chilensis colonised the Chilean coast from New Zealand. Combining archaeological observations with phylogeographic data provided evidence that exchanges between New Zealand and Chile have occurred at least before the Holocene, likely {{at the end of}} the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and we suggest that migration probably occurred via rafting. Furthermore, the remarkably low microsatellite diversity found in the Chilean populations compared to those in New Zealand is consistent with a recent genetic bottleneck as a result of over-exploitation of natural populations and/or the process of domestication. Therefore, the aquaculture of this seaweed, based essentially on clonal propagation, is occurring from genetically depressed populations and may be driving the species to an extinction vortex in Chile...|$|R

40|$|A {{review and}} {{analysis}} about several aspects on the modular construction in plants is presented, {{with emphasis on}} the ecological and evolutive consequences {{of this kind of}} construction. First of all, fundamentals that allow the reader to follow all the concepts without definition problems are given.

With concrete examples, consequences of modular construction in. form, size and regulation are described. Subsequently biological interactions with modular construction are approached, such as the relations that results from the competition between clonal organisms. The second section of the review is concentreated on the analysis of the concepts of modularity and clonality in the world of <b>marine</b> <b>macroalgae.</b> The definition of module in <b>marine</b> <b>macroalgae</b> is discussed with the conclusion that they can be conceptualized as modular organisms.

40|$|Bacteria {{associated}} with the <b>marine</b> <b>macroalga</b> Laminaria saccharina, collected from the Kiel Fjord (Baltic Sea, Germany), were isolated and tested for antimicrobial activity. From a total of 210 isolates, 103 strains inhibited the growth {{of at least one}} microorganism from the test panel including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria as well as a yeast. Most common profiles were the inhibition of Bacillus subtilis only (30 %), B. subtilis and Staphylococcus lentus (25 %), and B. subtilis, S. lentus, and Candida albicans (11 %). In summary, the antibiotic-active isolates covered 15 different activity patterns suggesting various modes of action. On the basis of 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarities > 99 %, 45 phylotypes were defined, which were classified into 21 genera belonging to Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria. Phylogenetic analysis of 16 S rRNA gene sequences revealed that four isolates possibly represent novel species or even genera.

The economically important <b>marine</b> <b>macroalga</b> Gracilaria tenuistipitata presents a circadian oscillation in NR protein content and activity. In order to identify if the regulation of NR in G. tenuistipitata happens at transcriptional levels, the NR cDNA and gene were sequenced and the NR mRNA expression was studied. Analysis of the sequenced gene revealed absence of introns which is unusual for NR genes. The transcriptional profiling revealed a circadian rhythm for NR; furthermore, a rhythm was observed in constant light condition, suggesting a possible regulation by the biological clock at the mRNA levels for NR in G. tenuistipitata.

40|$|The <b>marine</b> <b>macroalga,</b> Ulva lactuca, {{has been}} exposed for 48  h to {{different}} concentrations of Ag added as either silver nanoparticles (AgNP) or aqueous metal (AgNO(3)) and the resulting toxicity, estimated from reductions in quenching of chlorophyll-a fluorescence, and accumulation of Ag measured. Aqueous Ag was toxic at available concentrations as low as about 2. 5  μg l(- 1) and exhibited considerable accumulation that could be defined by the Langmuir equation. AgNP were not phytotoxic to the macroalga at available Ag concentrations up to at least 15  μg l(- 1) and metal measured in U. lactuca was attributed to a physical association of nanoparticles at the algal surface. At higher AgNP concentrations, a dose-response relationship was observed that {{was similar to that}} for aqueous Ag recorded at much lower concentrations.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{several studies have}} shown that {{inducible}} resistance is ubiquitous in brown algae. However, while many studies on terrestrial plants identified eliciting signals and the response cascade to resistance, the knowledge on inducible marine macroalgal defense is lagging far behind and is often restricted to the mere recognition of its presence. This study is the first to accurately quantify the temporal dynamics, i. e. the time lag of induction and relaxation, of antifeeding defense in a <b>marine</b> <b>macroalga,</b> Fucus vesiculosus, from the Baltic Sea. Time lag of induction and reduction of induced feeding resistance were assessed via feeding assays, because the identities of defensive compounds are still unknown. Our results demonstrate that F vesiculosus induced defense 10 - 14 days after the onset of grazing by the isopod Idotea baltica. Defenses were relaxed within 2 - 4 days after cessation of grazing. Thus, defense seems to be deployed sparingly and just long enough to avoid substantial loss of tissue. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
