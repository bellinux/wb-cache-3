40|$|The major {{chemical}} changes during the processing <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> occur with the breakdown in mastication and during vulcanization of the molded tire. There is little chemical change daring the compounding, calendering, extrusion, and molding steps. Reclaiming {{is the process}} <b>of</b> converting scrap <b>rubber</b> into an unsaturated, processible product that can be vulcanized with sulfur. Pyrolysis <b>of</b> scrap <b>rubber</b> yields a complex mixture of liquids, gas, and residue in varying ratios dependent {{on the nature of}} the scrap and the conditions of pyrolysis. The literature has little information on the chemistry <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> processing and disposal; it has been necessary to draw from various sources to develop a picture of the chemical events that may occur. This review is limited to natural rubber and to the important synthetic <b>rubbers</b> <b>of</b> the tire industry. Processing <b>Rubber</b> processing consists <b>of</b> operations performed on materials or systems to increase their utility through chemical reaction, flow, or permanent change in a physical property (1). The major processing steps wherein most chemical changes occur in tire production are: polymer breakdown by mastication on a mill or in a Banbury, extrusion, calendering, and curing. The tire building process and molding in the curing operation do not normally involve chemical reactions. Mastication In 1820 Hancock discovered the effect <b>of</b> <b>mastication</b> on <b>rubber.</b> The process has become basic in the commercial processing <b>of</b> <b>rubber.</b> <b>Mastication</b> gradually renders the rubber more plastic and decreases its solution viscosity.
