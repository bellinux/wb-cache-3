25|$|Mining {{operations}} {{began at}} the site in the early 1900s, <b>making</b> <b>Big</b> Dan {{one of the oldest}} mines in Temagami. Gold and silver were the mine's primary commodities, while arsenic was a secondary commodity. A forest fire destroyed much of the mining infrastructure on the site in 1907. Active mining operations on the site ceased following the fire, but mineral exploration has occurred there periodically since. Mineral exploration at Big Dan remained idle from the early 1970s to the early 1990s {{as a result of a}} land claim dispute applied by Temagami First Nations.|$|E
25|$|Dunyasha – a housemaid. Like Lopakhin, she {{is another}} example of social {{mobility}} in Russia at the time. A peasant who is employed as the Gayev's chambermaid, Dunyasha is an attention seeker, <b>making</b> <b>big</b> scenes and dressing as a lady to show herself off. She is in some respects representative of the aristocracy's impotence, as a lowly chambermaid would not in the past have had the freedom to dress like a lady and flirt with the manservants. Although pursued romantically by Yepikhodov, she is in love with Yasha, attracted to the culture he has picked up in Paris.|$|E
25|$|Gillespie {{occasionally}} proved his worth {{with the}} bat, with a highest Test score of 201 not out {{and an average}} of 18.73. He is the only player in Test cricket with a career batting average of less than 20 to reach 200 runs in an innings. He demonstrated a solid defensive game, known amongst teammates as 'The Walking Forward Defence', and despite not regularly <b>making</b> <b>big</b> scores, he was a difficult batsman to dismiss and occupied the crease for substantial periods of time, allowing his batting partner {{time to get a}} big score. Also, given his low back lift, he could defend or deflect shots from spin bowlers more readily.|$|E

25|$|Task Review: Renaissance's {{execution}} of the task was virtually flawless thanks to Raef and Simon; the team targeted large companies and got several orders by going door-to-door, <b>making</b> <b>big</b> earnings in both areas, while finishing their washing and pressing on time before the laundry closed and not losing any articles of clothing in the process. Meanwhile, Alpha's performance was dogged by problems; while they managed to secure work from businesses with dirty laundry, they had little luck going door-to-door. The team also started their work late, meaning they did not finish {{by the end of}} the first day, and lost two items in the process for which they were fined. As a direct result, the team effectively lost the task.|$|E
25|$|Netherland {{opens on}} protagonist Hans van den Broek, a Dutch {{financial}} analyst living in London with his English wife Rachel, but quickly flashes {{back to the}} years Hans spent in New York City before and {{in the immediate aftermath}} of 9/11. At the beginning of the novel, Hans is preparing to return to Manhattan for the funeral of estranged friend Chuck Ramkissoon, who becomes the central figure of the novel. Chuck, a Trinidadian immigrant, guides Hans into and through the world of The Staten Island Cricket Club, most of whose members are also of West Indian or South Asian descent. Chuck is a charismatic idealist, running multiple (occasionally illegitimate) businesses, and <b>making</b> <b>big,</b> optimistic plans for the future. While Hans is swept along by Chuck’s magnetic ardor for the American dream, Rachel moves back to London under the pretense of safety for their young son and ideological indignation over the American fixation on economic oppression. Though Rachel is a markedly less likeable character than Chuck, Hans eventually, inevitably follows her back to London. He loses touch with his Trinidadian friend who is discovered, years later, simply a body, handcuffed and disposed of in the Gowanus Canal.|$|E
25|$|Following {{his penchant}} for <b>making</b> <b>big</b> moves, Flyers General Manager Paul Holmgren pulled off perhaps the most {{stunning}} move of his tenure, trading Mike Richards to the Los Angeles Kings for Brayden Schenn, Wayne Simmonds and a 2012 second-round draft pick; and Jeff Carter to Columbus for their 2011 first-round pick (with which the Flyers selected Sean Couturier), 2011 third-round pick (with which the Flyers selected Nick Cousins) and Jakub Voracek, all within the span of one hour on June 23. Later that same day, Holmgren addressed the Flyers' long-standing goaltending issues by signing the Phoenix Coyotes' Ilya Bryzgalov to a nine-year, $51million contract. On July 1, the Flyers signed Jaromir Jagr to a one-year contract, Maxime Talbot to a five-year contract and Andreas Lilja to a two-year contract. Additionally, Chris Pronger was named Flyers captain; however, 13 games into the 2011–12 season, he was lost {{for the remainder of}} the regular season and playoffs with severe post-concussion syndrome. Bryzgalov's play ranged from spectacular to sub-par, including being benched in favor of Sergei Bobrovsky for the Flyers' 3–2 loss to the New York Rangers in the 2012 Winter Classic, but also being named NHL First Star for the month of March. Twelve rookies suited up for the Flyers during the season, with the play of Couturier, Schenn and Matt Read standing out impressively.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{attention}} focused on Auburn's two star running backs, the team also boasted a capable corps of wide receivers as well. Prior to the game, Auburn receiver Ben Obomanu said, [...] "When you have your running game <b>making</b> <b>big</b> plays and the defense has to load the box (defensive line) to make plays and {{try to stop the}} running game, that opens up things in the passing game." [...] Auburn averaged more yards passing (241.4per game) than running (189.4per game).|$|E
500|$|Over the years, Lavelli {{developed}} a reputation for <b>making</b> <b>big</b> plays when they counted most, {{as he had done}} with his touchdown reception in the Browns' first championship game in 1946. He was nicknamed [...] "Mr. Clutch" [...] in a Pittsburgh Steelers scouting report, although [...] "Gluefingers" [...] – a name bestowed upon him by Browns announcer Bob Neal – was more widely used. He practiced with Graham tirelessly to refine routes and was not afraid to run over the middle, where he risked a pounding from defenders when the ball came his way. [...] "Dante was the greatest guy at catching a ball in a crowd that I have ever seen," [...] Brown once said. Among other innovations, he and Graham also mastered sideline patterns at a time when few teams used them.|$|E

500|$|However, {{despite what}} Kobayashi said, not every single staff member {{was on the}} same page about {{changing}} the gameplay system. Kobayashi mentioned how some of the development team felt depressed and were hard to motivate after the focus of the game shifted from horror to action. Although Mikami demanded the camera system to be completely revised, the staff members had reservations about <b>making</b> <b>big</b> changes to the series he had created. Eventually, he intervened, explained his proposed changes, and wrote a new story for the title that, unlike previous installments, was not centered on the company Umbrella. Inspired by , a game Mikami had enjoyed playing but felt could have been better with a different view, he decided to place the camera behind the playable character. To go along with the new gameplay and story, a new type of enemy called [...] "Ganado" [...] was created, as opposed to using the undead creatures from previous Resident Evil games. Furthermore, producers expended additional detail to modify and update characters that had previously appeared in the series. In a documentary explaining the conception of the game's characters, Kamiya stated he intended to make Leon Kennedy [...] "look tougher, but also cool".|$|E

In December of the same year, G-Dragon collaborated with Skrillex and Diplo for the song [...] "Dirty Vibe", which also features labelmate CL.

500|$|Lopez's seventh studio album Love? (2011) was {{conceived}} in late 2007 and early 2008. During that time frame, {{under contract to}} Epic Records, Lopez released [...] "Louboutins", a song written and produced by The-Dream and Tricky Stewart, as the project's lead single. However upon release, the song failed to garner enough airplay to chart, despite topping the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. Lopez subsequently left Epic Records, citing that she had fulfilled her contractual obligations and now wished to release Love? under a new label. Upon signing with The Island Def Jam Music Group, Lopez continued working with The-Dream and Tricky Stewart, in addition to collaborating with new producers such as RedOne. It wasn't until January 2011 that Lopez teased the media about the new lead single for Love?. In a tweet on her Twitter account, Lopez posted: [...] "I see u @RedOne_Official!

500|$|Trailing the Minnesota Vikings 20–19 with 72 {{seconds left}} in the fourth quarter at the Metrodome in week 11, Phil Simms {{completed}} a desperate 22-yard pass on fourth and 17 to Bobby Johnson for a first down. The completion led to Raul Allegre's fifth field goal and an important Giants victory 22–20. In the Giants' three previous games, Simms had completed only six passes to wide receivers. In the Giants' victory he completed eight to wide receivers, four to tight end Mark Bavaro and 13 to his running backs—four to Ottis Anderson in the final two drives, three to Maurice Carthon, three to Joe Morris and three to Tony Galbreath. Simms commented years later, [...] "t's my favorite game in my career, because it's everything I always wanted to be as a player. I wanted to be tough, <b>making</b> <b>big</b> throws, immune to pressure, not worried about outcomes.

[...] The game has frequently been credited as a signature game of their season, and the Giants players celebrated the victory in the tunnel leading to their locker room and in the locker room itself in a raucous manner that was highly atypical for the team.
