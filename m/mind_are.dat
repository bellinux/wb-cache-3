5|$|Occasionalism is {{the view}} espoused by Nicholas Malebranche that asserts that all {{supposedly}} causal relations between physical events, or between physical and mental events, are not really causal at all. While body and <b>mind</b> <b>are</b> different substances, causes (whether mental or physical) are related to their effects {{by an act of}} God's intervention on each specific occasion.|$|E
5|$|Phenomenal externalism {{suggests}} that the phenomenal aspects of the <b>mind</b> <b>are</b> external to the body. Authors who addressed this possibility are Ted Honderich, Edwin Holt, Francois Tonneau, Kevin O'Regan, Riccardo Manzotti, Teed Rockwell and Max Velmans.|$|E

This power manifests as ten kinds which are - Sadangopeksha (when there is neither pleasure nor displeasure), Brahma-wiharopeksha (when the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> equally affected towards all beings), Bowdyangopeksha (when the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> equally affected towards all thoughts), Wiryopeksha (when the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> equally affected by the same force of determination), Sankharopeksha (when the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> equally affected towards all kinds of wisdom), Wedanopeksha (when the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> sensible to neither pleasure nor pain), Widarsanopeksha (when the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> not affected by what is seen), Tatramadyastopeksha (when all modes of upeksha are applied together), Dhyanopeksha (when the impermanency of sensible-objects is regarded with an even mind)and Parisudi-upeksha (when the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> equally affected towards all that is necessary to secure freedom from the cleaving to existence). All upekshas may be possessed by one and the same person but the second cannot be possessed without the first.|$|R
5|$|In another Buddhist text Majjhima Nikāya, the Buddha criticizes Jain {{emphasis}} on the destruction of unobservable and unverifiable types of karma {{as a means to}} end suffering, rather than on eliminating evil mental states such as greed, hatred and delusion, which are observable and verifiable. In the Upālisutta dialogue of this Majjhima Nikāya text, Buddha contends with a Jain monk who asserts that bodily actions are the most criminal, in comparison to the actions of speech and mind. Buddha criticises this view, saying that the actions of <b>mind</b> <b>are</b> most criminal, and not the actions of speech or body. Buddha also criticises the Jain ascetic practice of various austerities, claiming that he, Buddha, is happier when not practising the austerities.|$|E
5|$|Monism is the {{position}} that mind and body are not ontologically distinct entities (independent substances). This view was first advocated in Western philosophy by Parmenides in the 5th century BC and was later espoused by the 17th century rationalist Baruch Spinoza. Physicalists argue that only entities postulated by physical theory exist, and that mental processes will eventually be {{explained in terms of}} these entities as physical theory continues to evolve. Physicalists maintain various positions on the prospects of reducing mental properties to physical properties (many of whom adopt compatible forms of property dualism), and the ontological status of such mental properties remains unclear. Idealists maintain that the mind is all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself, or an illusion created by the mind. Neutral monists such as Ernst Mach and William James argue that events in the world {{can be thought of as}} either mental (psychological) or physical depending on the network of relationships into which they enter, and dual-aspect monists such as Spinoza adhere to {{the position}} that there is some other, neutral substance, and that both matter and <b>mind</b> <b>are</b> properties of this unknown substance. The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include behaviorism, the type identity theory, anomalous monism and functionalism.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Mind,</b> in Buddhism, <b>is</b> also {{described}} as being [...] "space-like" [...] and [...] "illusion-like". <b>Mind</b> <b>is</b> space-like {{in the sense that}} it is not physically obstructive. It has no qualities which would prevent it from existing. In Mahayana Buddhism, <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> illusion-like {{in the sense that it}} is empty of inherent existence. This does not mean it does not exist, it means that it exists in a manner that is counter to our ordinary way of misperceiving how phenomena exist, according to Buddhism. When the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> itself cognized properly, without misperceiving its mode of existence, it appears to exist like an illusion. There is a big difference however between being [...] "space and illusion" [...] and being [...] "space-like" [...] and [...] "illusion-like". <b>Mind</b> <b>is</b> not composed of space, it just shares some descriptive similarities to space. <b>Mind</b> <b>is</b> not an illusion, it just shares some descriptive qualities with illusions.|$|R

5|$|Where <b>is</b> the <b>mind</b> located? If the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> a {{physical}} phenomenon of some kind, {{it has to}} be located somewhere. According to some, there are two possible options: either the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> internal to the body (internalism) or the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> external to it (externalism). More generally, either the mind depends only on events and properties taking place inside the subject's body or it depends also on factors external to it.|$|R
25|$|Buddhist teachings {{explain the}} moment-to-moment {{manifestation of the}} mind-stream. The {{components}} {{that make up the}} <b>mind</b> <b>are</b> known as the five aggregates (i.e., material form, feelings, perception, volition, and sensory consciousness), which arise and pass away continuously. The arising and passing of these aggregates in the present moment is described as being influenced by five causal laws: biological laws, psychological laws, physical laws, volitional laws, and universal laws. The Buddhist practice of mindfulness involves attending to this constantly changing mind-stream.|$|E
25|$|Characters {{within the}} stories often {{point out that}} the Three Laws, as they exist in a robot's <b>mind,</b> <b>are</b> not the written {{versions}} usually quoted by humans but abstract mathematical concepts upon which a robot's entire developing consciousness is based. This concept is largely fuzzy and unclear in earlier stories depicting very rudimentary robots who are only programmed to comprehend basic physical tasks, where the Three Laws act as an overarching safeguard, but by the era of The Caves of Steel featuring robots with human or beyond-human intelligence the Three Laws have become the underlying basic ethical worldview that determines the actions of all robots.|$|E
25|$|After a {{traumatic}} experience, {{a person may}} re-experience the trauma mentally and physically, hence trauma reminders, also called triggers, can be uncomfortable and even painful. It can damage people’s sense of safety, self, self-efficacy, {{as well as the}} ability to regulate emotions and navigate relationships. They may turn to psychoactive substances including alcohol to try to escape or dampen the feelings. These triggers cause flashbacks, which are dissociative experiences where the person feels as though the events is reoccurring. They can range from distracting to complete dissociation or loss of awareness of the current context. Re-experiencing symptoms are a sign that the body and <b>mind</b> <b>are</b> actively struggling to cope with the traumatic experience.|$|E

I've just been noticing a resurgence of this idea of monster, of fantasy, but {{in a very real}} way. If you notice in those films, there’s always a juxtaposition of sex with death.

25|$|Penrose {{believes}} that such deterministic yet non-algorithmic processes may {{come into play}} in the quantum mechanical wave function reduction, and may be harnessed by the brain. He argues that the present computer is unable to have intelligence {{because it is an}} algorithmically deterministic system. He argues against the viewpoint that the rational processes of the <b>mind</b> <b>are</b> completely algorithmic and can thus be duplicated by a sufficiently complex computer. This contrasts with supporters of strong artificial intelligence, who contend that thought can be simulated algorithmically. He bases this on claims that consciousness transcends formal logic because things such as the insolubility of the halting problem and Gödel's incompleteness theorem prevent an algorithmically based system of logic from reproducing such traits of human intelligence as mathematical insight. These claims were originally espoused by the philosopher John Lucas of Merton College, Oxford.|$|E
