50|$|While {{land-based}} reactors {{in nuclear}} power plants produce up to around 1600 megawatts of power, a typical <b>marine</b> <b>propulsion</b> <b>reactor</b> produces {{no more than a}} few hundred megawatts. Space considerations dictate that a marine reactor must be physically small, so it must generate higher power per unit of space. This means its components are subject to greater stresses than those of a land-based reactor. Its mechanical systems must operate flawlessly under the adverse conditions encountered at sea, including vibration and the pitching and rolling of a ship operating in rough seas. Reactor shutdown mechanisms cannot rely on gravity to drop control rods into place as in a land-based reactor that always remains upright. Salt water corrosion is an additional problem that complicates maintenance.|$|E
50|$|The main {{difference}} between conventional submarines and nuclear submarines {{is the power}} generation system. Nuclear submarines employ nuclear reactors for this task. They either generate electricity that powers electric motors connected to the propeller shaft or rely on the reactor heat to produce steam that drives steam turbines (cf. nuclear <b>marine</b> <b>propulsion).</b> <b>Reactors</b> used in submarines typically use highly enriched fuel (often greater than 20%) {{to enable them to}} deliver a large amount of power from a smaller reactor and operate longer between refuelings - which are difficult due to the reactor's position within the submarine's pressure hull.|$|R

The STR (Submarine Thermal Reactor) pressurized water reactor designed at Argonne powered the first nuclear-powered submarine, the , and [...] became the basis of nearly all the reactors installed in warships.|$|R
40|$|Machining {{of nickel}} based super-alloys {{has gained a}} lot of {{importance}} {{in the last decade}} or so owing to their applications in areas like power generation (gas turbine), military aircrafts, <b>marine</b> <b>propulsion</b> and nuclear <b>reactors.</b> However, during high speed machining it faces a lot of problems in regard to thermal stress, and strain hardening, leading to premature tool failure. Use of cooling lubricants has declined in popularity because they pose a lot of problem with regards to their disposal, reuse and environmental safety. As a result coated tools have come into picture which improve the tool life in case of dry machining and increase productivity owing to their high thermal stability and integrity. Inconel 825 is a relatively newer grade of nickel bases super-alloys, on which a few tests have only been done. An attempt has been made to study the temperature and stress behaviour of tool insert, which in this case is taken as SNMG 120408 with respect to turning operation performed on Inconel 825 superalloy. The tool tip temperatures were found out and the temperature profiles were plotted for various feed and cutting speeds. Initial principal stress induced on the tool is also calculated. The variation of tool tip temperature and effective stress with respect to different cutting conditions were analysed and justified with respect to known knowledge. Comparative study has also been made between the uncoated tool and a CVD coated tool for the same cutting conditions...|$|R

40|$|Serving as {{the heart}} of ship, <b>marine</b> <b>propulsion</b> system is the most {{important}} power source. The longitudinal vibration power flow in the <b>marine</b> <b>propulsion</b> shaft-line is investigated theoretically and experimentally in this paper. The longitudinal vibration power flow analysis on <b>marine</b> <b>propulsion</b> shaft-line has been implemented using governing equations of continuum mechanics. In developing the mathematical model of <b>marine</b> <b>propulsion</b> shaft-line, the longitudinal vibration is defined theoretically. The concept of energy flow density and energy flow line are introduced in the models. A simulation model has been established to describe the properties of the longitudinal vibration power flow in the <b>marine</b> <b>propulsion</b> shaft-line. Analysis results show that the power transmission trend is along the shaft-line in longitudinal vibration. The total longitudinal vibration power flow predicted by the developed model was also compared with that tested using a MetaPower device. It was shown that the developed model provides a more accurate prediction of the total longitudinal vibration power flow of marine shafting in the frequency range of interest...|$|R

40|$|The {{utilization}} {{of nuclear power}} development and applications as a reliable source for energy production depends primarily {{on the ability of}} nuclear power plant operators and regulators to demonstrate excellence in safety and economic competitiveness. Since the first Enrico Fermi’ nuclear facility, the attention has been focused to manage the power from the nuclei in a controlled way. The possibility of an uncontrolled release of radioactive material leading to environment contamination and radiation exposure must be avoided following any reasonable situation. Excellent safety records have been assured from the operation of, nowadays 440 power production reactors and a much larger number of research and <b>marine</b> <b>propulsion</b> <b>reactors</b> summing up to more than 20000 reactor-year operation, with the noticeable exceptions of Three Mile Island- 2 and Chernobyl- 4 disasters both due to failure of humans, primarily. This has been possible through devoted research, qualification, discipline and proper management and involving gigantic endeavour from nuclear reactor technologists, designers, operators and safety assessors. Nowadays the human being may benefit of this incommensurable large, safe and non polluting source of energy provided a peaceful use is planned. The synthesis of the most relevant bases for the safety of operation constitutes a challenging effort that may need text-book. In this presentation an attempt is made to highlight sample keywords and to provide examples of results from recent safety analyses. First of all the nuclear safety is neither the privilege nor the ownership of a single Country, but owing to the global impact of any nuclear accident, it belongs to the humanity. The IAEA {{is a perfect example of}} international institution spreading and making available the nuclear safety technology to all Countries. The key concepts at the basis of safety classically are summarized as ‘defence-in-depth’, ‘safety-barrier’, and ‘As-Low-As-Reasonably-Achievable’. These concepts are the start of the passive, e. g. the containment, and of the active, e. g. the emergency core cooling systems, features that characterize the design of any nuclear reactor. The examples of results outlined here deal with: a) the safety evaluation of RBMK reactors (i. e. the Chernobyl type); b) the planning of new Accident-Management procedures for improving the safety of current pressurized water reactor, that also show the intrinsic quality of the original design of those systems; c) the results from a safety case, i. e. the double ended guillotine break of the largest piping connected with the pressure vessel of Atucha- 2; d) the power oscillation in a Boiling Water Reactor in the ‘extreme’ case when no power limitation system is called in operation. Related to RBMK reactors, constituted by more than 1500 boiling channels, the analyses could demonstrate that the eventual low probability (10 - 2 – 10 - 3 per reactor-year) explosion of a single channel does not cause a safety challenge to the remaining intact channels. Related to the Pressurized Water Reactors of current design, it was found that following the complete unavailability of “on site and off site” electrical power (i. e. including the failure of the Diesel engines) the reactor core may survive intact for more than 10 hours only using the water stored in various parts of the plant. Related to the Atucha- 2 PHWR (Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor) it was found that the safety aspects do not differ with respect to those characterizing a modern (generation 3) nuclear power plant. Related to the BWR (Boiling Water Reactor), the complex evolution of the core power predicted by advanced computational tools was shown in order to give an idea of the capabilities of those tools. The use of nuclear energy for electricity generation can be considered extremely safe and economic. Every year thousands people die in explosions in coal mines and in gas and oil extraction and transport facilities. Health and environmental impacts arising from fossil fuel use are again, incommensurably higher than in the case of the nuclear energy source...|$|R
