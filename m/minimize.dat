The number of transmission hops can be <b>minimized</b> by designating, as relays, the nodes forming the MCDS. However, the number of retransmissions and the latency are directly affected by the protocol characteristics, and there is no general rule for <b>minimizing</b> them--this motivates the presence, in the literature, {{of a large number of}} heuristic broadcast protocols.|$|R
