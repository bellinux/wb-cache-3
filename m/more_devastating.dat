5|$|In Egypt, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps were {{defeated}} by British forces under Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery in October 1942. The Allies landed in Sicily in July 1943 and in Italy in September. Meanwhile, American and British bomber fleets based in Britain began operations against Germany {{and in an}} effort to destroy German morale many sorties were intentionally given civilian targets. Soon German aircraft production could not keep pace with losses and without air cover the Allied bombing campaign became even <b>more</b> <b>devastating.</b> By targeting oil refineries and factories, they crippled the German war effort by late 1944.|$|E
5|$|Barlow {{immediately}} {{turned to}} investigate the strange sail, steering southwards directly at the lumbering vessel. Saulnier was seemingly unwilling to attempt any manoeuvere {{in the face of}} the enemy, as Africaine continued to hold the original course without deviation. By 19:30 it was inevitable that Phoebe would intercept Africaine and Saulnier shortened sail, slowing his frigate to meet the threat. Barlow was still unsure of the identity of the stranger and fired a shot over Africaine as a warning to its captain to identify his ship. Saulnier responded by turning to port and firing a broadside directly at Phoebe. It was poorly aimed however and mostly scattered into the sea without effect. At this, Barlow pulled Phoebe into a parallel position to Africaine and unleashed a much <b>more</b> <b>devastating</b> broadside from close range. The two frigates then began an exchange of fire at close range.|$|E
5|$|With the {{graduation}} of Luis Guzmán, Fernández switched {{back to his}} natural position at point guard in his junior campaign. Fernandez was a preseason All-Atlantic 10 Second Team selection. He was on the watchlist for the Bob Cousy Award honoring the top point guard in college basketball. A shooting slump that lasted {{the majority of the}} season saw his field goal percentage drop to 35.5%, his three point percentage drop to 33.3%, and his scoring average drop to 11.2 points per game. He still led the team in assists, with 3.9 per game. Fernández did miss four games {{in the middle of the}} season due to a bone bruise in his knee, but the shooting slump was <b>more</b> <b>devastating</b> and caused him to consult a sports psychologist. One of the worst games of his career was in an Atlantic 10 Tournament loss to Richmond, in which he went 3-for-17 from the field and committed three turnovers. After the game Fran Dunphy convinced Fernández that he had to take less shots and get his teammates involved.|$|E

Analogous to the recovering of architectural art which began here in Munich, here also started the purification {{in the sphere of}} painting and sculpture, that maybe had been even <b>more</b> <b>devastated.</b> The whole swindle of a decadent or pathological trend-art has been swept away. A decent common level has been reached. And this means a lot. Only out of this can the truly creative genius arise." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{conflict}} {{lasted for}} over 150 years {{and followed the}} pattern of British settlement in Australia. Beginning in New South Wales {{with the arrival of}} the first Europeans in May 1788, it continued in Sydney and its surrounds until the 1820s. As the frontier moved west so did the conflict, pushing into outback New South Wales in the 1840s. In Tasmania, fighting can be traced from 1804 to the 1830s, while in Victoria and the southern parts of South Australia, the majority of the violence occurred during the 1830s and 1840s. The south-west of Western Australia experienced warfare from 1829 to 1850. The war in Queensland began in the area around Brisbane in the 1840s and continued until 1860, moving to central Queensland in the 1850s and 1860s, and then to northern Queensland from the 1860s to 1900. In Western Australia, the violence moved north with European settlement, reaching the Kimberley region by 1880, with violent clashes continuing until the 1920s. In the Northern Territory conflict lasted even later still, especially in central Australia, continuing from the 1880s to the 1930s. One estimate of casualties places European deaths at 2,500, while at least 20,000 Aborigines are believed to have perished. Far <b>more</b> <b>devastating</b> though was the effect of disease which significantly reduced the Aboriginal population by the beginning of the 20th century; a fact which may also have limited their ability to resist.|$|E
25|$|Hurricane season {{runs from}} June 1 to November 30, with a peak from mid-August through early October. Some of the <b>more</b> <b>devastating</b> hurricanes have {{included}} the Galveston Hurricane of 1900, Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The remnants of tropical cyclones from the Eastern Pacific also occasionally impact the western United States, bringing moderate to heavy rainfall.|$|E

25|$|After {{the fall}} of Najibullah's Democratic Republic of Afghanistan in April 1992, leaders of the {{different}} mujahideen factions were unable to form a government. Despite the 1992 Peshawar Accords, fighting started as Hekmatyar's party refused to sign the accords and started shelling the city for power. This marked {{the start of a}} dark period of the city, in which over 50,000 civilians were killed. About 80 percent of the city was devastated and destroyed by 1996. A The New York Times analyst said in 1996 that the city was <b>more</b> <b>devastated</b> than Sarajevo, which was similarly destroyed during the Bosnian War in those years.|$|R
60|$|Farther {{along the}} slope Yaqui halted and crawled behind {{projections}} {{to a point}} commanding a view over an extraordinary section of country. The peaks were off to the left. In the foreground were gullies, ridges, and canyons, arroyos, all glistening with choyas and some other and more numerous white bushes, and here and there towered a green cactus. This region was only a splintered and <b>more</b> <b>devastated</b> part of the volcanic slope, but it was miles in extent. Yaqui peeped {{over the top of}} a blunt block of lava and searched the sharp-billowed wilderness. Suddenly he grasped Gale and pointed across a deep wide gully.|$|R
25|$|Lazar {{was killed}} at the Battle of Kosovo in June 1389 while leading a pan-Christian army {{assembled}} to confront the invading Ottoman Empire, led by Sultan Murad I. The battle ended without a clear victor, though both sides endured heavy losses, which were <b>more</b> <b>devastating</b> for the less numerous Serbs and their Christian allies. Lazar's widow, Milica, who ruled as regent for their adolescent son Stefan Lazarević, Lazar's successor, accepted Ottoman suzerainty {{in the summer of}} 1390.|$|E
25|$|The Germans {{had felt}} {{relatively}} safe from timed artillery fire {{because they thought}} that the bad weather prevented the Allies from observing their movements accurately. When the Americans employed the POZIT proximity fuse, their artillery fire was far <b>more</b> <b>devastating,</b> decimating German troops caught in the open, causing up to 20% losses. The effectiveness of the new fused shells exploding in mid-air stirred some German soldiers to refuse orders {{to move out of}} their bunkers during an artillery attack. U.S. General George S. Patton said that the introduction of the proximity fuse required a full revision of the tactics of land warfare.|$|E

25|$|Far <b>more</b> <b>devastating</b> {{in their}} impact on the Aboriginal population, however, were the effects of disease, infertility, loss of hunting grounds and starvation. There are {{indications}} that smallpox epidemics may have impacted heavily on some Aboriginal tribes, with depopulation in large sections of what is now Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland up to 50% or more, even before the move inland from Sydney of squatters and their livestock. Other diseases hitherto unknown in the Indigenous populationsuch as the common cold, flu, measles, venereal diseases and tuberculosisalso had an impact, significantly reducing their numbers and tribal cohesion, and so limiting their ability to adapt to or resist invasion and dispossession.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1950 season, Berry was {{not even}} first-choice left-arm spinner for Lancashire, his long-time friend Malcolm Hilton being often {{preferred}} as the spin alternative to the off-spin of Roy Tattersall. Hilton was reckoned as the <b>more</b> <b>devastating</b> bowler on a turning wicket, and could also bowl flatter and faster than Berry, which meant that he was at times used to open the bowling. Berry was known for flight and spin, but was also inclined to be more expensive than Hilton. Nonetheless, it was Berry who was picked for the 1950–51 MCC tour to Australia and New Zealand under Freddie Brown. He had a poor tour on pitches not designed for spin and was not chosen for any of the Test matches, with Doug Wright being preferred. Hilton was picked for the 1951–52 tour to India, and Berry did not play Test cricket again.|$|E

25|$|The {{commander}} of the Polish 3rd Army in Ukraine, General Rydz-Śmigły, decided to break through toward the northwest {{and the town of}} Korosteń, thus avoiding a direct confrontation with the bulk of Soviet 1st Cavalry Army near Koziatyń. Soviet forces were plagued by communication and coordination difficulties, and Polish forces managed to withdraw in orderly fashion and relatively unscathed, they were tied down in Ukraine and lacked sufficient strength to support Poland's Northern Front and reinforce the defenses at the Auta River for the decisive battle that was soon to take place there. Polish 3rd Army and newly formed 2nd Army regrouped near Słucza and started a series of their own counterattacks. However, Polish counterattacks in June and July all failed after initial successes. In the battles (19 June at Usza, 1 July at Horyń, 8 July at Równe) Bolsheviks were delayed but eventually Budionny's forces advanced east. When eventually in mid July Bolsheviks forces in Ukraine appeared to have been stopped by Polish forces, a new Soviet offensive north would prove even <b>more</b> <b>devastating</b> for the Polish forces.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Franciscan missionary efforts {{began in the}} area in the 1590s, there had been a {{significant}} decrease in both population and in the number of remaining villages in the Agua Dulce area. Moreover, there appear to have been at least three smaller, independent chiefdoms operating in what had formerly been Utina territory. The details of the decline are unclear, but the <b>more</b> <b>devastating</b> warfare and Old World diseases introduced by the Europeans probably contributed. The core part of the chiefdom remained inhabited, but the declining population appears to have withdrawn south, with the administrative center shifting to the village of Antonico. The Spanish referred to the inhabitants as the Agua Dulce or Agua Fresca, the Freshwater tribe. Northern villages that had not been abandoned were at that time under the authority of the Christian chiefs of Tocoy. The Tocoy chiefdom established a new town to the east, closer to St. Augustine. Additionally, the Acuera, who were named as part of Chief Utina's confederacy in the 1560s, had become an independent chiefdom.|$|E

50|$|Although both {{countries}} were affected heavily by the fire, China and the Soviet Union responded very differently. China, despite its shortage of advanced firefighting equipment, sent over 60,000 soldiers and workers {{to try and}} put out the fire. Because the forest was {{a major source of}} wood for China as well as {{the fact that it was}} close to the Gobi desert and thus a factor in desertification in northern China, China spent much effort on extinguishing the flames. The Soviets, on the other hand, simply let the fire burn out on its side of the border because its vast timber reserves were not seriously threatened by the fire. When the fire finally stopped over a month later, the differences in responses were clear: The Soviet Union had lost over 15 million acres of forest, while China had lost only 3 million (though it was <b>more</b> <b>devastated</b> economically).|$|R

50|$|Uncontrolled la maraude tactics often {{resulted}} in violence or devastation. There are many accounts of rape, murder, and massacre of locals. In certain regions, pillaging was so severe and violent {{that the local}} populations rose up in revolt. Such forms or resistance caused these locals to be deemed enemies of the Revolution. Some marauding soldiers were killed by vengeful peasants or hanged by military authorities as an example. La maraude sometimes {{left a trail of}} destruction in the army's path. Soldiers dismantled houses and buildings to obtain firewood, metal scraps, and other materials. The tactic was largely unsuccessful in regions that were too poor to have a surplus or that were already pillaged and barren. The Grande Armée famously encountered these problems in Russia in 1812. Local populations had fled the region, and the Russian armies, upon their retreat, had destroyed anything that may have been useful to their enemies. Napoleon's troops lacked supplies on their advance into the Russian empire, and were even <b>more</b> <b>devastated</b> upon retreat from Moscow. The unsustainable characteristics of la maraude tactics contributed to Napoleon's demise.|$|R
