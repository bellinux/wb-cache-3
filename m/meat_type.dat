On the other hand, the crossprice elasticity of beef showed a complementary relationship with the other <b>meat</b> <b>types,</b> except for fish, which is substitutive. Chicken and fish showed a substitutive relationship with all other <b>meat</b> <b>types.</b> Duck showed a substitutive relationship with all meats except rabbit.

50|$|Packing {{methods and}} meat grading {{could not be}} {{included}} in the archaeological investigation because samples of meat included in the investigation were highly disturbed, meaning they were not in situ {{at the time of their}} recovery. Conservation restraints made the excavation of intact casks too costly, however, analysis of both beef and pork carcasses artefacts recovered from William Salthouse found that these examples of imported salted meats would be indistinguishable from Australian terrestrial sites in Australia due to commonalities in butchering techniques. Similarities between the butcher marks on both ribs and vertebrae recovered from the wreck and Australian butchered meats from the First Government House make the cuts of meat indistinguishable. This similarity merits further consideration, since the square cutting of beef samples shows a high degree of similarity. Butchering practices are further complicated by factors such as type of carcase, quality, meat bearing capacity, consumer taste, economic climate and the source of trade training. The range of external factors that impact use of <b>meat</b> <b>type</b> require investigations to address the relationship of site occupants to forms of supply, and the butchering mark morphology and frequency.|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} were to estimate the genetic distance and to determine the discriminant variables among fighting and meat types sheep of Garut (Garut sheep). A total of 413 heads of Garut sheep from five sub-populations were used in this study. Data were collected from the Regional Animal Research Center (BPPTD) as follows: 102 heads of common type sheep from Margawati (M), 69 heads from <b>meat</b> <b>type</b> sheep from Wanaraja (P), 72 heads of <b>meat</b> <b>type</b> from Sukawening (D), 81 heads of fighting sheep from Wanaraja (T) and 89 heads of fighting sheep from Sukawening (A). Data obtained were analyzed by simple discriminant with SAS package program version 7. 0 and MEGA 2 program to get the construction of phenogram tree. The results showed that in general fighting sheep had body weights and body measurements significantly higher (P < 0. 05) than <b>meat</b> <b>type</b> sheep. However they were almost the same as common type sheep Margawati. The length and width of ears, tail width and chest width were the most discriminant variables to determine the differences of fighting type and <b>meat</b> <b>type</b> sheep. The highest similarities between individuals inside the group were obtained from Margawati common type sheep (71. 57 %), followed by Wanaraja <b>meat</b> <b>type</b> sheep (69. 57 %), Sukawening <b>meat</b> <b>type</b> sheep (69. 44 %), Wanaraja fighting type sheep (69. 14 %) and Sukawening fighting type sheep (59. 55 %).

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the demand for}} beef, mutton/goat, pork and chicken in Kenya for the period 1961 to 1991. A log linear function was used to estimate direct, cross and income elasticities. The analysis reveals that the demand for beef and mutton/goat is elastic while the demand for pork and chicken is inelastic. The results of further analyses indicate that mutton/goat is a substitute to beef while pork and chicken are complements to it. In the mutton/goat equation, beef is a substitute to mutton/goat while pork and chicken are complements to it. Both the beef and the mutton/goat equations indicated an income elasticity of more than one.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the differences in biochemical, sensorial and quality characteristics of retail beef in Belgium. Four types of beef (Belgian Blue double-muscled, Limousin, Irish and Argentine) and two different muscles (longissimus lumborum and semimembranosus) were bought at the retail level and compared with regard to colour, shear force, collagen content, fatty acid analysis, taste panel evaluation as well as flavour analysis. Belgian Blue and Limousin beef had a paler colour, lower collagen and intramuscular fat contents. Fatty acid profiles were significantly different between the four types, with significantly higher PUFA/SFA and n- 6 /n- 3 ratios for Belgiam Blue and Limousin beef compared to Argentine and Irish beef. There were significant differences between the <b>meat</b> <b>types</b> for taste panel tenderness and shear force, however both measurements did not fully correspond. Flavour analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as well as sensory analysis demonstrated that Irish and Argentine beef had a higher flavour intensity related to higher contents of volatile compounds.
