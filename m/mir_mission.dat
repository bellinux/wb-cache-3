40|$|Vision, {{being one}} of our most {{important}} senses, is critically important in the unique working environment of space flight. Critical evaluation of the astronauts visual system begins with pre-selection examinations resulting in an average of 65 % of all medical disqualification's caused by ocular findings. With an average age of 42, approximately 60 % of the astronaut corps requires vision correction. Further demands of the unique training and working environment of microgravity, variable lighting from very poor to extreme brightness of sunlight and exposure to extremes of electromagnetic energy results in unique eyewear and contact lens applications. This presentation will describe some of those unique eyewear and contact lens applications used in space flight and training environments.

40|$|The {{presence}} of a causal association between the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes {{and the risk of}} cancer has been substantiated recently by epidemiological studies. Cytogenetic analyses of crew members of the Mir Space Station have shown that {{a significant increase in the}} frequency of chromosomal aberrations can be detected after flight, and that such an increase is likely to be attributed to the radiation exposure. The risk of cancer can be estimated directly from the yields of chromosomal aberrations, taking into account some aspects of individual susceptibility and other factors unrelated to radiation. However, the use of an appropriate technique for the collection and analysis of chromosomes and the choice of the structural aberrations to be measured are crucial in providing sound results. Based on the fraction of aberrant lymphocytes detected before and after flight, the relative risk after a long-term <b>Mir</b> <b>mission</b> is estimated to be about 1. 2 - 1. 3. The new technique of mFISH can provide useful insights into the quantification of risk on an individual basis...|$|E

50|$|Early in 1940, the British Army {{had been}} making plans for a {{campaign}} in Norway, ostensibly to support Finland in the Winter War against Russia, who then had a pact of alliance with Germany. When the Finns capitulated on 12 March 1940, the troops assigned to the operation were instead sent to France. Nevertheless, contingency planning continued. As part of this, MI(R), a department of the War Office responsible for irregular operations, was asked to plan for raids on the Norwegian coast.

40|$|Presented are {{results of}} {{studying}} 24 -hr variability of the cardiac rhythm which characterizes individual difference in reactions of two crew {{members to the}} same set of stresses during a 115 -day <b>MIR</b> <b>mission.</b> Spacelab (USA) cardiorecorders were used. Data of monitoring revealed significantly different baseline health statuses of the cosmonauts. These functional differences were also observed in the mission. In one of the cosmonauts, the cardiac regulation changed over to a more economic functioning with the autonomous balance shifted towards enhanced sympathetic activity. After 2 - 3 months on mission he had almost recovered pre-launch level of regulation. In the other, the regulatory system was appreciably strained {{at the beginning of the}} mission as compared with preflight baseline. Later on, on flight months 2 - 3, this strain kept growing till a drastic depletion of the functional reserve. On return to Earth, this was manifested by a strong stress reaction with a sharp decline in power of high-frequency and grow in power of very low frequency components of the heart rhythm. The data suggest that adaptation to space flight and reactions in the readaptation period are dependent on initial health status of crew members, and functional reserve...|$|E

40|$|The {{real-time}} {{measurement of}} radiation environment {{was made with}} an improved real-time radiation monitoring device (RRMD) -II onboard Space Shuttle STS- 79 (S/MM# 4 : 4 th Shuttle <b>MIR</b> <b>Mission,</b> at an inclination angle of 51. 6 degrees and an altitude of 250 - 400 km) for 199 h during 17 - 25 September, 1996. The observation of the detector covered the linear energy transfer (LET) range of 3. 5 - 6000 keV/micrometer. The Shuttle orbital profile in this mission was equivalent {{to that of the}} currently planned Space Station, and provided an opportunity to investigate variations in count rate and dose equivalent rate depending on altitude, longitude, and latitude in detail. Particle count rate and dose equivalent rate were mapped geographically during the mission. Based on the map of count rate, an analysis was made by dividing whole region into three regions: South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region, high latitude region and other regions. The averaged absorbed dose rate during the mission was 39. 3 microGy/day for a LET range of 3. 5 - 6000 keV/micrometer. The corresponding average dose equivalent rates during the mission are estimated to be 293 microSv/day with quality factors from International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) -Pub. 60 and 270 microSv/day with quality factors from ICRP-Pub. 26. The effective quality factors for ICRP-Pub. 60 and 26 are 7. 45 and 6. 88, respectively. From the present data for particles of LET > 3. 5 keV/micrometer, we conclude that the average dose equivalent rate is dominated by the contribution of galactic cosmic ray (GCR) particles. The dose-detector depth dependence was also investigated...|$|E
40|$|To obtain {{information}} on the cytogenetic damage caused by space radiation, chromosome exchanges in lymphocytes from crewmembers of long-term <b>Mir</b> <b>missions,</b> and a shorter duration shuttle mission, were examined using fluorescence in situ hybridization. A significant increase in chromosomal aberrations was observed after the long duration flights. The ratio of aberrations identified as complex was higher post-flight for some crewmembers, which {{is thought to be}} an indication of exposure to high-LET radiation. Ground-based {{studies have shown that the}} frequency of aberrations measured post-flight could be influenced by a mitotic delay in cells damaged by high-LET radiation and this effect could lower biological dose estimates. To counteract this effect, prematurely condensed chromosome (PCC) spreads were collected. Frequencies of aberrations in PCC were compared with those in metaphase spreads...|$|R

40|$|On Earth, the low-frequency afferent {{signal from}} the {{otoliths}} encodes head tilt {{with respect to the}} gravitational vertical, and the higher frequency components reflect both tilt and linear acceleration of the head. In microgravity, static tilt of the head does not influence otolith output, and the relationship between sensory input from the vestibular organs, and the visual, proprioceptive and somatosensory systems, would be disrupted. Several researchers have proposed that in 0 -g this conflict may induce a reinterpretation of all otolith signals by the brain to encode only linear translation (otolith tilt-translation reinterpretation or OTTR). Ocular counter-rolling (OCR) is a low-frequency otolith-mediated reflex, which generates compensatory torsional eye movements (rotation about the visual axis) towards the spatial vertical during static roll tilt with a gain of approximately 10 %. Transient linear acceleration and off-axis centrifugation at a constant angular velocity can also generate OCR. According to the OTTR hypothesis, OCR should be reduced in microgravity, and immediately upon return from a 0 -g environment. Results to date have been inconclusive. OCR was reduced following the 10 day Spacelab- 1 mission in response to leftward roll tilts (28 - 56 % in 3 subjects and unchanged in one subject), and sinusoidal linear oscillations at 0. 4 and 0. 8 Hz. OCR gain declined 70 % in four monkeys following a 14 day COSMOS mission. Following a 30 day <b>MIR</b> <b>mission</b> OCR gain decreased in one astronaut, but increased in two others following a 180 day mission. We have studied the affect of microgravity on low-frequency otolith function {{as part of a larger}} study of the interaction of vision and the vestibular system. This experiment (E- 047) involved off-axis centrifugation of payload crewmembers and flew aboard the recent Neurolab mission (STS 90). Presented below are preliminary results focusing on perception and the OCR response during both centrifugation and static tilt...|$|E
40|$|Space {{radiation}} dosimetry measurements {{have been made}} onboard the Space Shuttle STS- 65 in the Second International Microgravity Laboratory (IML- 2 : 28. 5 degrees x 300 km: 14. 68 days) and the STS- 79 in the 4 th Shuttle <b>MIR</b> <b>mission</b> (S/MM# 4 : 51. 6 degrees x 300 - 400 km: 10. 2 days). In these measurements, three kinds of detectors were used; one is a newly developed active detector telescope called "Real-time Radiation Monitoring Device (RRMD-I for IML- 2 and RRMD-II with improved triggering system for S/MM# 4) " utilizing silicon semi-conductor detectors and the other detectors are conventional passive detectors of thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLDs) and CR- 39 plastic track detectors. The main contribution to dose equivalent for particles with LET > 5. 0 keV/micrometer (IML- 2) and LET > 3. 5 keV/micrometer (S/MM# 4) is seen {{to be due to}} galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and the contribution of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) is less than 5 % (IML- 2 : 28. 5 degrees x 300 km) and 15 % (S/MM# 4 : 51. 6 degrees x 400 km) in the above RRMD LET detection conditions. For the whole LET range (> 0. 2 kev/micrometer) obtained by TLDs and CR- 39 in these two typical orbits (a small inclination x low altitude and a large inclination x high altitude), absorbed dose rates range from 94 to 114 microGy/day, dose equivalent rates from 186 to 207 microSv/day and average quality factors from 1. 82 to 2. 00 depending on the locations and directions of detectors inside the Spacelab at the highly protected IML- 2 orbit (28. 5 degrees x 300 km), and also, absorbed dose rates range from 290 to 367 microGy/day, dose equivalent rates from 582 to 651 microSv/day and average quality factors from 1. 78 to 2. 01 depending on the dosimeter packages around the RRMD-II "Detector Unit" at the S/MM# 4 orbit (5 l. 6 degrees x 400 km). In general, it is seen that absorbed doses depend on the orbit altitude (SAA trapped particles contribution dominant) and dose equivalents on the orbit inclination (GCR contribution dominant). The LET distributions obtained by two different types of active and passive detectors, RRMDs and CR- 39, are in good agreement for LET of 15 - 200 kev/micrometer and difference of these distributions in the regions of LET 200 kev/micrometer can be explained by considering characteristics of CR- 39 etched track formation especially for the low LET tracks and chemical etching conditions...|$|E
