Analysts say that if India pushed more {{fundamental}} <b>market</b> <b>reforms,</b> it could sustain the rate and even reach the government's 2011 target of 10%. States have large responsibilities over their economies. The average annual growth rates (2007-12) for Uttarakhand (13.66%), Bihar (10.15%) or Jharkhand (9.85%) were higher than for West Bengal (6.24%), Maharashtra (7.84%), Odisha (7.05%), Punjab (6.85%) or Assam (5.88%).

40|$|The year 1996 was {{a turning}} point both in terms of Chinese labor <b>market</b> <b>reform</b> and in China's {{economic}} growth pattern. Before 1996, labor <b>market</b> <b>reform</b> was mainly implemented through adjustment of people's occupation and income structure. Since 1996, employment restructuring has led to differentiation in terms of employment status. Labor <b>market</b> <b>reform</b> in the former stage resulted in slow growth in wages, whereas reform in the latter stage enhanced economic efficiency. Both stages have enabled the Chinese economy to apply its comparative advantage of low labor cost. Labor <b>market</b> <b>reform</b> has also increased income disparity and, therefore, new challenges are posed in sustaining economic growth. China needs to adjust its development strategies and introduce labor <b>market</b> <b>reform</b> that can improve income equality, so as to achieve sustainable economic development.

This article examines the electoral dynamics of <b>market</b> <b>reform</b> in Argentina between 1989 and 1995, and provides insights into the way that regional economic differentiation and the territorial distribution of political resouces in federal polities can shape the design of <b>market</b> <b>reform</b> and the coalitional bases for its political sustainability. The electoral viability of the governing Peronist party during the conflictual reform period was facilitated by regionally segmented patterns of electoral coalition-building, and by the regional phasing {{of the costs of}} <b>market</b> <b>reform.</b> Structural reforms were concentrated primarily on economically strategic regions, while public spending and political patronage in economically marginal but politically over-represented regions helped sustain support for the governing party.

40|$|Despite {{improving}} {{labour market}} conditions in recent years, {{a number of}} EMU countries still suffer from high and persistent unemployment. It could therefore be expected that labour <b>market</b> <b>reform</b> would be given a prominent position on the political agenda. The new constraints associated with the common monetary policy only increase the pressure for reform. Relying on {{the introduction of the}} single currency as a trigger for labour <b>market</b> <b>reform</b> may be a risky strategy. EMU generates a complex set of re-optimising strategies of the players on the labour market, which makes it difficult to get a clear idea what impact it will have on labour <b>market</b> <b>reform.</b> Evaluation of recent reform measures does not make one confident either. The empirical analysis confirms to some extent the idea that countries with higher unemployment rates have carried out more labour <b>market</b> <b>reform.</b> This finding holds, however, only for countries that do not belong to EMU. EMU countries have on average carried out no more reform than countries outside EMU and any link between the initial unemployment level and the labour <b>market</b> <b>reform</b> indicators seems to lack. It may become apparent that more reform is needed once the macroeconomic environment becomes more unfavourable. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2001. ...|$|R

The first part presents the conceptual framework, which identifies a variety of implicit taxes and subsidies that {{must be taken into}} account (in addition to implicit taxes on exports, as emphasized by Pinto (1991)) in assessing the fiscal and inflationary effects of exchange <b>market</b> <b>reform.</b> A formula that attempts to capture explicitly these taxes and subsidies is derived. The second part applies the formula to six countries (Guyana, India, Jamaica, Kenya, Sierra Leone, and Sri Lanka).
