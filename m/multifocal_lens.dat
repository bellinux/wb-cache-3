30|$|Nowadays, {{although}} there are already several kinds of solid progressive <b>multifocal</b> <b>lens</b> or progressive addition lens in the market, the method to realize progressive multifocal adjustment mechanism is still under research. Progressive <b>multifocal</b> <b>lens</b> can distributes {{the power of the}} three important zones namely far view zone, near view zone and intermediate zone progressively and smoothly [1]. G. Savio, G. Concheri and R. Meneghello designed a progressive lens applying discrete shape modelling techniques which considered both optical and geometrical parameters [2]. Likewise, Wei-Yao Hsu, Yen-Liang Liu and Yuan-Chieh Cheng proposed a progressive <b>multifocal</b> <b>lens</b> surface with a B-spline description optimizing from the average power of the far and near view zones [3]. Then a variational-difference numerical method for designing the optical freeform surface of a progressive <b>multifocal</b> <b>lens</b> was introduced, it can minimize the functional directly by finite difference method rather than approximate the solution of the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation to the functional [4]. Moreover, a multioptical-axis mathematical model based on the human eye in the different observation orientations was developed to design the freeform progressive <b>multifocal</b> <b>lens</b> through theoretical and experimental investigations [5].|$|E
40|$|Animal {{eyes that}} are {{primarily}} used under low-light conditions usually have optical systems of short depth of focus, such that chromatic defocus {{may lead to}} considerable blurring of the images. In some vertebrates, the problem is solved by <b>multifocal</b> <b>lenses</b> having concentric zones of different focal lengths, each of which focuses a different relevant spectral range onto the retina. A partially constricted circular pupil would shade the peripheral zones of the lens, leading {{to the loss of}} well-focused images at relevant wavelengths. The slit pupil, however, allows for use of the full diameter of the lens even in bright light. We studied species of terrestrial vertebrates from a variety of phylogenetic groups to establish how widespread <b>multifocal</b> <b>lenses</b> are and how pupil shapes are adapted to the optical systems. We found that <b>multifocal</b> <b>lenses</b> are common from amphibians to mammals, including primates. Slit pupils were only present in animals having multifocal optical systems. Among the felids, small species have <b>multifocal</b> <b>lenses</b> and slit pupils, while large species have monofocal lenses and round pupils. The Eurasian lynx, a cat of intermediate size, has an intermediate eye design. The functional significance of the absence of multifocal optical systems in large felids remains mysterious, because such systems are present in other large-eyed terrestrial vertebrates. Multifocal optical systems in nocturnal prosimians suggest that those animals have colour vision despite being described as cone monochromats...|$|R
40|$|The spherical {{crystalline}} lenses in {{the eyes}} of many fish species are well-suited models for studies on how natural selection has influenced the evolution of the optical system. Many of these lenses exhibit multiple focal lengths when illuminated with monochromatic light. Similar multifocality is present in a majority of vertebrate eyes, and it is assumed to compensate for the defocusing effect of longitudinal chromatic aberration. In order to identify potential optical advantages of <b>multifocal</b> <b>lenses,</b> we studied their information transfer capacity by computer mod-eling. We investigated four lens types: the lens of Astatotilapia burtoni, an African cichlid fish species, an equiva-lent monofocal lens, and two artificial <b>multifocal</b> <b>lenses.</b> These lenses were combined with three detector arrays of different spectral properties: the cone photoreceptor system of A. burtoni and two artificial arrays. The optical properties compared between the lenses were longitudinal spherical aberration curves, point spread functions, modulation transfer functions, and imaging characteristics. The <b>multifocal</b> <b>lenses</b> had a better balance between spatial and spectral information than the monofocal lenses. Additionally, the lens and detector array had to be matched to each other for optimal function. © 2012 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 330. 0330, 330. 1070. 1...|$|R

40|$|Purpose:Providing an {{objective}} and subjective evaluation of life quality and satisfaction {{level of the}} patients who underwent cataract surgery with implant of bifocal, <b>multifocal</b> and monofocal <b>lenses.</b> Methods:Bifocal lenses were implanted in 72 patients, aspheric <b>multifocal</b> <b>lenses</b> in 16 patients, apodized <b>multifocal</b> <b>lenses</b> in 20 patients and Monofocal lenses were implanted in 63 patients. The patients answered a 47 question questionnaire, whose results were evaluated and analyzed. Results:The level of satisfaction of the patients implanted with bifocal and <b>multifocal</b> <b>lenses</b> {{was significantly higher than}} of those with monofocal lenses (kruskal - Wallis test, p< 0. 001 followed by the Dunn test, p< 0. 05). As to the comparison of monofocal lenses with bifocal and <b>multifocal</b> <b>lenses,</b> the near vision without correction was considerably lower in patients with monofocal lenses (Z test p< 0. 001). The patients with monofocal lenses without correction presented a much lower capacity of reading newspapers or books and as far as manual work than the ones with bifocal and <b>multifocal</b> <b>lenses</b> (Z test, p< 0. 001). Conclusion:The result of this study shows that the patients who received the bifocal and <b>multifocal</b> <b>lenses</b> had a remarkable improvement in their visual acuity for the near vision, being pleased with their general vision without wearing glasses. This is because they were able to read books and newspapers, write checks, fill out forms, do sports, shave or put on make-up, hence having high quality of life without correction. Objetivo:Fornecer uma avaliação objetiva e subjetiva da qualidade de vida e o nível de satisfação de pacientes que se submeteram à cirurgia de catarata, com implante de lentes bifocais, multifocais e monofocais. Métodos:Lentes bifocais foram implantadas em 72 pacientes; lentes multifocais asférica em 16 pacientes; lentes multifocais apodizada em 20 pacientes e lentes monofocais em 63 pacientes. Foi aplicado um questionário de 47 perguntas cujos resultados foram avaliados e analisados. Resultados:O nível de satisfação dos pacientes implantados com lentes bifocais e multifocais foi significantemente mais alto do que aqueles com lentes monofocais (teste Kruskal-Wallis p< 0, 01, seguido do teste Dunn, p< 0, 05). Quanto à comparação de lentes monofocais com lentes bifocais e multifocais, a visão para perto sem correção foi consideravelmente mais baixa em pacientes com lentes monofocais (teste Z, p< 0, 001). Os pacientes com lentes monofocais sem correção apresentaram uma menor capacidade de ler jornais ou livros e no que diz respeito a trabalhos manuais do que aqueles com lentes bifocais e multifocais (teste Z, p< 0, 001). Conclusão:Os resultados deste estudo mostram que os pacientes que receberam as lentes bifocais e multifocais tiveram uma melhora notável em sua acuidade visual para perto, estando satisfeitos com sua visão geral, sem óculos. A satisfação foi atribuída ao fato de conseguirem ler livros e jornais, preencher cheques, preencher formulários, praticar esportes, se barbear ou se maquiar sem correção.

40|$|The {{following}} paper compares contrast sensitivity, glare, post-operational visual acuity, independency {{of glasses}} and patient satisfaction of {{three groups of}} patients with regards to three types of interocular lenses: <b>multifocal</b> <b>lenses</b> Acrysof ReSTOR SN 60 D 3 with blue filter (19 patients), aspheric monofocal lenses without blue filter AMO Tecnis Z 9002 (21 patients) and monofocal lenses with blue light filter Alcon AcrySof IQ Aspheric - SN 60 WF (21 patients). The inclusion criterion {{for this study was}} that patients have only a cataract and no pathological ailments. In regards to contrast sensitivity, patients tested with aspheric monofocal lenses with blue filter SN 60 WF had better results than patients with aspheric monofocal lenses without blue filter Z 9002 and with <b>multifocal</b> <b>lenses</b> with blue filter ReSTOR. These differences however were not significant and did not affect patient satisfaction. This study shows that a blue filter can have a positive influence on the contrast sensitivity under photopic and mesopic conditions. Post-operational tests show that, in contrast to most of the patients with monofocal lenses, the patients who had multifocal implants could read without the help of glasses. The potential uncorrected visual acuity of patients of monfocal lenses was very good. The best acuity with correction was good for all patients The success rate of patients who did not need glasses was 6 % by monofocal lenses, however 72 % by <b>multifocal</b> <b>lenses</b> ReSTOR. By almost all cases of monofocal lense implants there was, as expected, a deficit in uncorrected near vision of Nieden 4 and 6. The examination of patients with <b>multifocal</b> <b>lenses</b> ReSTOR made of Acryl with asymmetrical distribution of light proves to be an effective lense, which allows patients, after having a cataract operation to live a “life without glasses. ” Patients who choose this lense type must then be willing to accept that there are some disadvantages, particularly with regards to contrast sensitivity, glare and a small reduction in visual acuity. So, currently, after appropriate consultation, the <b>multifocal</b> blue filter <b>lenses</b> with diffractive optic is considered to be an effective solution to lense replacement in cases of cataracts as well as refractive lense surgery...|$|R

40|$|<b>Multifocal</b> contact <b>lenses</b> rely on {{a complex}} optical {{delivery}} system to provide the needed optics to the eye. Proper centration of these optics is vital to success. Conventionally these lenses are fitted over {{the center of the}} cornea (pupillary axis). This method of fitting contact lenses does not necessarily ensure proper alignment of the multifocal optics over the visual axis. Our purpose is to investigate the effect of multifocal optical centration on objective (distance acuity) and subjective (clarity, visual ghosting, and visual fluctuation) vision. Five clinical emmetropes (with no existing ocular or systemic diseases) was recruited for our study. Medmont Corneal Topography was used to identify the optical location of the <b>multifocal</b> contact <b>lenses</b> and their distances from the visual axis. Visual acuity and subjective vision was compared to identify the effect <b>multifocal</b> contact <b>lens</b> centration had on vision. Findings show consistent correlation between optical centration to both objective and subjective vision. Lenses appear to consistently decenter superiorly and temporally despite a manufactured 1. 00 mm nasal offset of optical centration. There appears to be an association between increasing ADD power and decreasing subjective vision. This association was not evident on objective distance vision.

40|$|PURPOSE: <b>Multifocal</b> contact <b>lenses</b> {{have been}} growing in {{popularity}} as a modality to correct presbyopic eyes, although visual side effects such as disability glare have been reported. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of <b>multifocal</b> contact <b>lenses</b> on disability glare by means of ocular straylight. METHODS: A prospective randomized, comparative study was performed that included 16 subjects free of ocular pathology. Straylight was measured using a commercial straylight meter with the natural and dilated pupil. Participants were fitted with Proclear Multifocal (Distance/Near), ACUVUE Oasys for Presbyopia, and Air Optix Aqua Multifocal randomized to the left or right eye. Straylight measurements were repeated with the contact lens in situ after the pupil dilation. Results obtained with the dilated pupil without contact lens acted as a control. RESULTS: Diameter of the natural and dilated pupil was 2. 87 ± 0. 40 mm and 7. 45 ± 0. 86 mm, respectively (P <. 001). After pupil dilation, straylight increased from 0. 92 ± 0. 13 log(s) to 1. 04 ± 0. 11 log(s) (P <. 001). Of the four studied lenses, a significant difference was only found between Air Optix and the control group (P =. 006). The latter showed also slightly increased light scatter. CONCLUSIONS: A difference in measured straylight was found between the studied <b>multifocal</b> <b>lenses.</b> The observed variability and the straylight-pupil size dependency should be taken into account to avoid elevated straylight in <b>multifocal</b> contact <b>lens</b> wearers.

40|$|AIM: To {{analytically}} {{assess the}} effect of pupil size upon the refractive power distributions of different designs of <b>multifocal</b> contact <b>lenses.</b> METHODS: Two <b>multifocal</b> contact <b>lenses</b> of center-near design and one <b>multifocal</b> contact <b>lens</b> of center-distance design were used in this study. Their power profiles were measured using the NIMO TR 1504 device (LAMBDA-X, Belgium). Based on their power profiles, the power distribution was assessed {{as a function of}} pupil size. For the high addition lenses, the resulting refractive power as a function of viewing distance (far, intermediate, and near) and pupil size was also analyzed. RESULTS: The power distribution of the lenses was affected by pupil size differently. One of the lenses showed a significant spread in refractive power distribution, from about ? 3 D to 0 D. Generally, the power distribution of the lenses expanded as the pupil diameter became greater. The surface of the lens dedicated for each distance varied substantially with the design of the lens.
