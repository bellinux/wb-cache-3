There is, therefore, a need to index and retrieve information from such <b>multi-media</b> <b>collections.</b> The Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR) has a number of projects to index and retrieve multi-media information. These include: 1. The extraction of text from images which may be used both for finding text zones against general backgrounds as well as for indexing and retrieving image information. 2. Indexing hand-written and poorly printed documents using image matching techniques (word spotting). 3.

40|$|Technological {{developments}} now allow community groups, clubs, {{and even}} ordinary individuals {{to create their}} own, publicly accessible online digital <b>multi-media</b> <b>collections.</b> However, it is unclear {{as to whether the}} users of such collection are fully aware of the potential privacy implications of submitting their personal contents (e. g. photographs, video, etc.) to these digital collections. They may even hold misconceptions of the technological support for preserving their privacy. In this paper we present results from 18 auto-ethnographic investigations and 19 ethnographic observations and interviews into privacy issues that arise when people make their personal photo collections available online. The Adams´ privacy model is used to discuss the findings according to information sensitivity, information receiver, and information usage. Further issues of trust and ad hoc poorly supported protection strategies are also presented. Ultimately while photographic data is potentially highly sensitive, the privacy risks are often hidden and the protection mechanisms are limited...|$|R
40|$|Given {{an image}} (or video clip, or audio song), {{how do we}} {{automatically}} assign keywords to it? The general problem is to find correlations across the media {{in a collection of}} multimedia objects like video clips, with colors, and/or motion, and/or audio, and/or text scripts. We propose a novel, graph-based approach, "MMG", to discover such cross-modal correlations. Our "MMG" method requires no tuning, no clustering, no user-determined constants; it can be applied to any <b>multi-media</b> <b>collection,</b> {{as long as we have}} a similarity function for each medium; and it scales linearly with the database size. We report auto-captioning experiments on the "standard" Corel image database of 680 MB, where it outperforms domain specific, fine-tuned methods by up to 10 percentage points in captioning accuracy (50 % relative improvement) ...|$|E
40|$|Cataloging a large, <b>multi-media</b> <b>collection</b> of {{traditional}} song and drama {{in preparation for}} online presentation highlights issues of song identity and access {{in the context of}} contemporary digitized archives. In the James Madison Carpenter collection a particular folksong sung by a particular individual may exist in multiple manifestations: typed song text, sound recording(s), and/or manuscript music notation. While controlled vocabulary references such as Child and Roud numbers provide a degree of identification, such narrative- and text-centric tools are only partly effective in differentiating folkloric materials. Additional means are needed for identifying and controlling folk materials which are distinguished by other aspects of the song such as melody or non-narrative text. The Carpenter project team’s experience with Encoded Archival Description (EAD) illustrates the value of this platform-independent, widely recognized standard and suggests opportunities for further developments particularly suited to locating and retrieving folk music materials...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present Heritage+, an {{integrated}} platform for interactive access {{of different types}} of media elements through an unified interface. A unique aspect of Heritage+ is that it deals with document images as distinct media type and implements tools and techniques for browsing and querying document images along with other media elements like video sequences and images. Further, Heritage+ proposes a new scheme for encoding and use of ontology for accessing <b>multi-media</b> <b>collection.</b> In the context of document images, the ontology specifies the document class-specific semantics of the logical components that help in an automated semantically meaningful linking of documents and their components with heterogeneous media-type resources. Further, Heritage+ supports conceptual query of document images along with other media elements. This multi-functional access interface to the document images is provided in Heritage+ using a novel model guided document image segmentation scheme and word-image based indexing scheme...|$|E

40|$|The Cheshire II {{online catalog}} system was {{designed}} to pro-vide {{a bridge between the}} realms of purely bibliographical information and the rapidly expanding full-text and <b>multi-media</b> <b>collections</b> available online. It is based on a number of national and international standards for data descrip-tion, communication, and interface technology. The sys-tem uses a client-server architecture with X window client communication with an SGML-based probabilistic search engine using the 239. 50 information retrieval protocol. 1. introduction Online public access catalogs have provided access to the collections of increasing numbers of libraries for over a decade. Indeed, many of the online catalogs at large research libraries are now over a decade old, and they have used the same basic search methods, user interface, and hardware configuration for that entire period. While there have been various condemnations of online catalogs, or nostalgic recollections of card catalogs (Baker, 1994)) the online catalog has been embraced by both librarians and library patrons (more or less happily). The primary effect of library automation, as applied to the catalog, has been to facilitate rapid and effective access to the desired items in the collection when the author, title, or subject headings of the item are known to the searcher. However, it has also been recognized for over a decade that the present generation of online catalogs in most libraries do not {{do a very good job}} of providing topical or subject access to the collection...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the 1998 TREC- 7 Spoken Document Retrieval (SDR) Track which implemented {{an evaluation of}} retrieval of broadcast news excerpts {{using a combination of}} automatic speech recognition and information retrieval technologies. The motivations behind the SDR Track and background regarding its development and implementation are discussed. The SDR evaluation collection and topics are described and summaries and analyses {{of the results of the}} track are presented. Alternative metrics for automatic speech recognition as applicable to retrieval applications are also explored. Finally, plans for future SDR tracks are described. 1. BACKGROUND Spoken Document Retrieval (SDR) involves the search and retrieval of excerpts from recordings of speech using a combination of automatic speech recognition and information retrieval techniques. In performing SDR, a speech recognition engine is applied to an audio input stream and generates a time-marked textual representation (transcription) of the speech. The transcription is then indexed and may be searched using an information retrieval engine. In traditional information retrieval, a topic (or query) results in a rank-ordered list of documents. In SDR, a topic results in a rank-ordered list of temporal pointers to potentially relevant excerpts. In an operational SDR system, these excerpts could be topical sections of a recording of a conference or radio or television broadcasts. SDR was chosen as a TREC domain because of its potential use in navigating large <b>multi-media</b> <b>collections</b> of the near future and because it was believed that the component Automatic Speech Recognition and Information Retrieval technologies might work well enough now for usable SDR in some domains. SDR also provides a rich research domain in that it supports both development of large-scale near-real-time continuous speech recognition technologies and technologies for retrieval of spoken language. Further, SDR provides...|$|R
