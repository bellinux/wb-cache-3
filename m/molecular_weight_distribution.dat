25|$|Metallocene {{polyethylene}} (PE-M) {{is prepared}} {{by means of}} metallocene catalysts, usually including copolymers (z. B. ethene / hexene). Metallocene polyethylene has a relatively narrow <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>distribution,</b> exceptionally high toughness, excellent optical properties and a uniform comonomer content. Because of the narrow <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>distribution</b> it behaves less pseudoplastic (especially under larger shear rates). Metallocene polyethylene has a low proportion of low molecular weight (extractable) components and a low welding and sealing temperature. Thus, it is particularly suitable for the food industry.|$|E
25|$|Polyethylene with {{multimodal}} <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>distribution</b> {{consists of}} several polymer fractions, which are homogeneously mixed. Such polyethylene types offer extremely high stiffness, toughness, strength, {{stress crack resistance}} and an increased crack propagation resistance. They consist of equal proportions higher and lower molekularerer polymer fractions. The lower molecular weight units crystallize easier and relax faster. The higher molecular weight fractions form linking molecules between crystallites, thereby increasing toughness and stress crack resistance. Polyethylene with multimodal <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>distribution</b> can be prepared either in two-stage reactors, by catalysts with two different active centers on a carrier or by blending in extruders.|$|E

25|$|Polypropylene is in {{many aspects}} similar to polyethylene, {{especially}} in solution behaviour and electrical properties. The additionally present methyl group improves mechanical properties and thermal resistance, while the chemical resistance decreases. The properties of polypropylene depend on the molecular weight and <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>distribution,</b> crystallinity, type and proportion of comonomer (if used) and the isotacticity. In isotactic polypropylene, for example, the CH3 groups are oriented {{on one side of}} the carbon backbone. This creates a greater degree of crystallinity and results in a stiffer material that is more resistant to creep than both atactic polypropylene and polyethylene.|$|E
25|$|Reversible addition-fragmentation chain {{transfer}} or RAFT polymerization {{is one of}} several kinds of reversible-deactivation radical polymerization. It makes use of a {{chain transfer}} agent {{in the form of a}} thiocarbonylthio compound (or similar, from here on referred to as a RAFT agent, see Figure 1) to afford control over the generated molecular weight and polydispersity during a free-radical polymerization. Discovered at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) of Australia in 1998, RAFT polymerization {{is one of several}} living or controlled radical polymerization techniques, others being atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP), etc. RAFT polymerization uses thiocarbonylthio compounds, such as dithioesters, thiocarbamates, and xanthates, to mediate the polymerization via a reversible chain-transfer process. As with other controlled radical polymerization techniques, RAFT polymerizations can be performed with conditions to favor low dispersity (<b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>distribution)</b> and a pre-chosen molecular weight. RAFT polymerization can be used to design polymers of complex architectures, such as linear block copolymers, comb-like, star, brush polymers, dendrimers and cross-linked networks.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} lab {{techniques}} {{are used to}} determine the properties of polymers. Techniques such as wide angle X-ray scattering, small angle X-ray scattering, and small angle neutron scattering are {{used to determine the}} crystalline structure of polymers. Gel permeation chromatography is used to determine the number average molecular weight, weight average molecular weight, and polydispersity. FTIR, Raman and NMR can be used to determine composition. Thermal properties such as the glass transition temperature and melting point can be determined by differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis. Pyrolysis followed by analysis of the fragments is one more technique for determining the possible structure of the polymer. Thermogravimetry is a useful technique to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymer. Detailed analysis of TG curves also allow us to know a bit of the phase segregation in polymers. Rheological properties are also commonly used to help determine molecular architecture (molecular weight, <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>distribution</b> and branching) as well as to understand how the polymer will process, through measurements of the polymer in the melt phase. Another polymer characterization technique is Automatic Continuous Online Monitoring of Polymerization Reactions (ACOMP) which provides real-time characterization of polymerization reactions. It can be used as an analytical method in R, as a tool for reaction optimization at the bench and pilot plant level and, eventually, for feedback control of full-scale reactors. ACOMP measures in a model-independent fashion the evolution of average molar mass and intrinsic viscosity, monomer conversion kinetics and, in the case of copolymers, also the average composition drift and distribution. It is applicable in the areas of free radical and controlled radical homo- and copolymerization, polyelectrolyte synthesis, heterogeneous phase reactions, including emulsion polymerization, adaptation to batch and continuous reactors, and modifications of polymers.|$|E

40|$|The {{factors that}} {{determine}} the Wurtz-type reductive coupling of dichloroorganosilanes by alkali metals are reviewed. A strong recommendation is advanced {{for carrying out}} all such polysilane syntheses in tetrahydrofuran at ambient temperature, conditions under which the reaction gives far higher yields and generally much narrower product <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>distributions.</b> The higher yields are attributed {{to the ability of}} the solvent to sequester the sodium ion and thereby stabilize the anionic chain carriers. The bimodal <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>distributions</b> of the product polymers, which are ubiquitous when such reactions are carried out in high-boiling-point aromatic solvents under reflux, as is common practice, are attributed to it being a defect-diffusion-controlled polymerization at the alkali metal surface.

40|$|Atom {{transfer}} {{radical polymerization}} is a versatile technique for exerting precise control over polymer <b>molecular</b> <b>weights,</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>distributions,</b> and complex architectures.

Modulation of polymerization kinetics is thereby tunable in real time by varying the magnitude of applied potential. Application of multistep intermittent potentials successfully triggers initiation of polymerization and subsequently toggles the polymerization between dormant and active states in a living manner.

2500|$|A common {{means of}} expressing {{the length of}} a chain is the degree of polymerization, which quantifies the number of {{monomers}} incorporated into the chain. As with other molecules, a polymer's size may also be expressed in terms of molecular weight. Since synthetic polymerization techniques typically yield a polymer product including a range of molecular weights, the weight is often expressed statistically to describe the distribution of chain lengths present in the same. Common examples are the number average molecular weight and weight average molecular weight. The ratio of these two values is the polydispersity index, commonly used to express the [...] "width" [...] of the <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>distribution.</b> A final measurement is contour length, which can be understood as the length of the chain backbone in its fully extended state.|$|E

40|$|Spontaneous {{initiation}} in {{emulsion polymerization}} {{may be more}} important: than in the corresponding bulk free-radical polymerization. A methodology is derived for finding the locus of spontaneous polymerization in emulsion polymerization, through use of spin traps and catalysts which can accelerate decomposition of peroxides. Applying this to both styrene and chloroprene (chlorobutadiene), {{it is found that}} this generation occurs to some degree within all phases present. The rate of spontaneous initiation is relatively small in styrene emulsion polymerization but large in chloroprene. A means of including this effect in modeling rates and <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>distributions</b> is derived, which also shows how rate parameters for the process may be obtained from experimental <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>distributions.</b> This methodology is applied to these two monomers, with a series of seeded emulsion polymerizations using polystyrene host seeds for both. For styrene polymerization, the spontaneous initiation rate is low and varies with latex preparation; consistent values for this rate coefficient for a given latex are obtained by independent measurements involving two different techniques, thereby verifying the methodology. Applying this methodology to chloroprene, it is found that the effect of spontaneous initiation is much larger and probably arises from peroxides formed by exposure to oxygen. For chloroprene, spontaneous radical generation occurs both within the particles and in any monomer droplets present, with different chain-stopping mechanisms occurring in these two phases. It is a major influence on rates and <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>distributions,</b> even in the presence of large amounts of added initiator; chain stoppage in droplets is largely by transfer to monomer, whereas chain stoppage within particles is by termination with short radicals formed by spontaneous initiation.
