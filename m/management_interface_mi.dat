Current standards exist to create <b>management</b> <b>interfaces</b> to allow operational management of services while keeping the services basic functionality fixed. These standards lack the ability to facilitate the establishment of agreements between services across administrative domains or with a divergent level of autonomy and adaptability. In this {{paper we propose a}} multi-faceted <b>management</b> <b>interface</b> capable of both operational and contractual operations. This allows relationships to be established between services with varying levels of capability. We then apply this <b>management</b> <b>interface</b> to an existing architectural framework that explicitly represents agreements as contracts between services and manages the interferences between those contracts...|$|R

50|$|In computing, a <b>management</b> <b>{{interface}}</b> is {{a network}} interface dedicated to configuration and <b>management</b> operations. <b>Management</b> <b>interfaces</b> are typically connected to dedicated {{out of band}} management networks (either VPNs or physical networks), and non-management interfaces {{are not allowed to}} carry device or network management traffic. This greatly reduces the attack surface of the managed devices, as external attackers cannot access management functions directly, and thus improves network security.|$|R
