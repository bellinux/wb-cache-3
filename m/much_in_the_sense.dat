5000|$|Williams {{then looks}} at the {{developments}} in other languages, especially in German, to follow the development of 'culture' in English. German borrowed the word from French, Cultur and later spelt Kultur, its main use synonymous to 'cultivation': first in the abstract sense of a general process of becoming 'civilized or cultivated'; second in the sense which had already been established for civilization by the historians of the Enlightenment as {{a description of the}} secular process of human development. Then Johann Gottfried von Herder, according to Williams, in his unfinished Ideas on the Philosophy of the History of Mankind (1784—91), brought about a decisive change of use in the word where he challenged the universal histories' assumption that civilization or culture - the historical self-development of humanity - was a unilinear process; an assumption that led to the [...] "high and dominant point of C18 European Culture" [...] and thereby attacking that very dominant claim to a superior culture. Taking up from Herder, [...] "cultures in the plural" [...] were looked at; to speak of [...] "cultures of the plural: the specific and variable cultures of different nations and periods, but also the specific and variable cultures of social and economic groups within a nation." [...] This sense of culture was widely developed in the Romantic movement {{as an alternative to the}} orthodox and dominant 'civilization'. And from here, the new concept of 'folk-culture' emerged, emphasizing national and traditional cultures. this sense of culture was primarily a response to the emergence of the [...] "mechanical character of the new civilization", and was used to distinguish between [...] "human and material development". However, the 1840s in Germany saw Kultur being used very <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of civilization as used in the C18 universal histories. Williams uses G F Klemms' Allgemeine Kulturgeschichte de Menschheit - 'General Cultural History of Mankind' (1843-52) - to show this use of Kultur in the sense of tracing human development from savagery through domestication to freedom.|$|E

This paper finds if real house prices grow at their historical average pace, then owning a home is about as expensive as renting. If prices grow more slowly, as some forecasters predict, the framework used in this paper suggests that the average home buyer would be financially better off renting. House prices are decomposed into contributions from rents, interest rates and expected capital gains, which may help policymakers in the detection of housing bubbles.

Institutionally and technologically, the Romanian society went beyond the traditionalism phase and oscillates between modern and post-modern orientations. Traditionalism remains in the social value sphere. The aversion toward risk and the confidence in the explanatory power of religion, even moderated with a rejection attitude toward fatalism constitute such reflexes. The totalitarian communist state, having maximum control over the society’s life, ended up inhibiting values that support civic participation and maintaining the interest for politics at a moderate level.

40|$|Extract] At face value, {{the concept}} of {{biological}} diversity, or biodiversity, is an objective measure used by scientists to describe ecosystem characteristics. Biodiversity {{is defined by the}} United Nations Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) as variability among living organisms at a number of levels ranging from the members of individual species through to ecosystems and bioregions (UNEP 1992). In lay terms this may be translated as the number of genetically distinct plants, animals and micro-organisms present in any given territory. Biodiversity is also, however, an inherently social concept. This is not so <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> that science and the creation of scientific knowledge are themselves social activities (involving institutions, collaboration, conventions on the use of evidence etc.), but in the sense that humans and human activities are intimately implicated in the ecosystem processes through which biodiversity is reproduced and transformed. The CBD and related conventions recognise the social dimensions of biodiversity in a variety of ways: acknowledging the roles of indigenous people and farmers in managing biodiversity; identifying biodiversity as the foundation of food security and poverty alleviation; and defining plant genetic resources as a 'common heritage of mankind' (FAO 1989, p. 8) ...|$|E

Pennsylvania German, as a distinct variety, developed through levelling processes from L 1 varieties of these migrants who came mainly from the southwestern regions of the German speaking area. Pennsylvania German is still spoken today by specific religious groups (primarily Amish and Menonnite groups) for many of whom it is an identity marker. My paper focuses on those Pennsylvania Germans who {{are not part of}} these religious groups but have the same migration history. Due to their being closer to the cultural values of American mainstream society, they were integrated into it, and during the 20 th century their use of Pennsylvania German was continually diminishing.

O modelo de escolha racional concebe o indivíduo como um agente econômico; logo, ao contemplar a possibilidade de envolvimento em um ato ilícito, responde a incentivos sócio-econômicos, a partir da avaliação racional entre ganhos e perdas esperadas, advindos das atividades ilícitas vis-à-vis o ganho alternativo no mercado legal.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} to {{what extent}} it is justifiable to classify Philip Larkin as a love poet. It finds that love is indeed {{one of the central}} themes in the work of this poet, who is usually associated with other, much bleaker, themes such as death. Through detailed close reading of his poems and reference to his prose, it explores the nature, the possibility and different aspects of human relationships and love, whose significance in Larkin's work is never taken at face value and whose treatment is unconventional. In order to understand love's place in his poetry, more general themes are discussed, such as the place of illusions and ideals in people's lives, possibility of choice, the question of desire, and personal identity in relationships. In order to discuss these themes in depth, the thesis also investigates the ways in which Larkin's poems about love fit into the tradition of English poetry. It further presents an extensive outline of Larkin's development as a love poet showing how the themes connected with love and their formal treatment changed throughout his writing career. This thesis has tried to show that most of Philip Larkin's poems {{have something to say about}} love. However, whether it allows us to call Larkin a love poet or not is difficult to say.
