He stormed over to <b>my</b> <b>cabin</b> and dragged me out, half asleep, on to the track. That was that! He and the other officials kept their eyes on us after that and we had little chance of getting away with any more larks like that.|$|E

What should I do now, with no lifebelt and no shoes and no cap? ...|$|E

[Chorus] Here in <b>my</b> old <b>Cabin</b> Home, Here is my sister and my brother, Here lies my wife, the joy of my life, And my child in the grave with its mother. [Verse 2] I am going to leave this land, with this our darkey band, To travel all the wide world over, And when I get tired I will settle down to rest, Away down in <b>my</b> Old <b>Cabin</b> Home. [Chorus] [Verse 3] When old age comes on us, And my hair is turning gray, I will hang up the banjo all alone; I’ll set down by the fire, And I’ll pass the time away, Away down in my Old Home. [Chorus] [Verse 4] ‘Tis there where I roam, Away down on the old farm, Where all the darkeys am free; O merrily sound the banjo For de white folks round de room, Away down in <b>my</b> Old <b>Cabin</b> Home.

It was while speaking to a West Indian Negro who was a passenger with me from Southampton, who was returning home to the East Indies from Basutoland with his Basuto wife, I further learned of the horrors of native life in Africa. He related to me in conversation such horrible and pitiable tales that my heart bled within me. Retiring from the conversation to <b>my</b> <b>cabin,</b> all day and the following night I pondered over the subject matter of that conversation, and at midnight, lying flat on my back, the vision and thought came to me that I should name the organization the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities (Imperial) League. Such a name I thought would embrace the purpose of all black humanity. Thus to the world a name was born, a movement created, and a man became known." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the accused}} mutineers was David Creagh, second officer of the Charles II. He testified that after refusing to {{participate}} in the mutiny—the only officer to do so—he was ordered to return below deck. On the way to his cabin, Creagh encountered William May, Captain Gibson's former steward. May, described by Every as one of the [...] "true cocks of the game, and old sportsmen," [...] was zealously supportive of the mutiny, and Creagh testified of their bone-chilling exchange:I met with W. May, the Prisoner at the Bar. What do you say here? says he. I made him no Answer, but went down to my Cabin; and he said, God damn you, you deserve to be shot through the Head; and he then held a Pistol to my Head. Then I went to <b>my</b> <b>Cabin,</b> and presently came orders from Every, that those that would go ashore, should prepare to be gone. And when the Captain was got out of Bed, who was then very ill of a Feaver, Every came and said, I am a Man of Fortune, and must seek my Fortune.|$|E
