25|$|Around 1970, Gibson {{replaced}} the P-90 on several models with a mini side-by-side humbucker {{now known as}} the mini-humbucker. This pickup was originally used on Epiphone models such as the Sheraton and with suitable <b>mounting</b> <b>hardware</b> became interchangeable with the P-90. In response to a resurgence of popularity of the P-90 Gibson issued the P-100, a stacked version (see above) of the P-90. Gibson also makes a new noiseless P-90 version called the H-90, which is found in Billie Joe Armstrong's Signature Les Paul Junior. The H-90 has two stacked coils and Gibson claims that it does not lose the characteristics of a P-90 although many players feel differently, perhaps contributing to its lack of use in other guitars.|$|E
500|$|P90 TR:The P90 TR (Triple Rail) model, {{also known}} as the [...] "flat-top," [...] was {{introduced}} in late 1999. It features a receiver-mounted triple MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail interface system, or [...] "Triple Rail," [...] for mounting accessories. There is one full-length accessory rail integrated into the top of the receiver, and two rail stumps are included {{on the sides of the}} receiver. The top rail will accept various optical sights with no tools or additional <b>mounting</b> <b>hardware</b> required, and the side rails serve to mount secondary accessories, such as tactical lights or laser aiming devices.|$|E
2500|$|Inspired by Jim Hall, Chapman {{was among}} those who helped {{introduce}} aerodynamics into Formula One car design. Lotus used the concept of positive aerodynamic downforce, through the addition of wings, at a Tasman Formula race in early 1968, although Ferrari and Brabham were the first to use them in a Formula One race at the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix. Early versions, in 1968 and 1969, were mounted [...] or so above the car, in order to operate in 'clean air' (air that would not otherwise be disturbed by the passage of the car). The underdesigned wings and struts failed regularly, however, compelling the FIA to require the wing <b>mounting</b> <b>hardware</b> to be attached directly to the sprung chassis. Chapman also originated the movement of radiators away {{from the front of the}} car to the sides, to decrease frontal area (lowering aerodynamic drag) and centralising weight distribution. These concepts remain features of virtually all high performance racing cars today.|$|E

25|$|Two of the Royal Flying Corps' early Bristol Scout C aircraft, numbers 1609 and 1611, {{flown by}} Captain Lanoe Hawker with No. 6 Squadron RFC, were each, in their turn – as 1609 was {{written-off}} from combat damage, 1611 received its gun <b>mount</b> <b>hardware</b> as its replacement—armed with a Lewis machine {{gun on the}} left side of the fuselage, almost identical to the manner of the rifles tried on the second Scout B, using a mount that Hawker had designed. When Hawker downed two German aircraft and forced off a third on 25 July 1915 over Passchendaele and Zillebeke he was awarded the first-ever Victoria Cross for the actions of a British single-seat military scout/fighter pilot in aerial combat against an enemy's heavier-than-air aircraft, following the earlier VC awards to William Rhodes-Moorhouse (flying a B.E.2 two-seat observation biplane) and Reginald Warneford (flying against an enemy Zeppelin) in April and June 1915 respectively.|$|R
50|$|Blocking, {{often called}} backing or {{sometimes}} grounds, also refers to {{pieces of wood}} or other material that run between wall studs {{in order to provide}} support and attachment sites for <b>mounted</b> <b>hardware</b> or trim such as cabinets, shelving, handrails, vanity tops without a cabinet underneath, bathroom towel bars, mouldings etc. Properly installed blocking is easier to find and use for attaching wall hardware than studs alone. Once drywall, or any other material, covers the wall {{it can be difficult to}} find 2x4 studs for attachment, and the position of nails and screws must be adjusted to stud location. Thus, if blocking is installed at a uniform and predetermined height, attachment sites can be found without using a stud finder, and the blocking can be utilized anywhere along a wall at that height. This is particularly useful for installing upper cabinets in kitchens or bathrooms as they tend to be fairly heavy and finding appropriate studs for installation can be difficult.|$|R

50|$|Solyndra designed, manufactured, {{and sold}} solar {{photovoltaic}} (PV) systems composed of panels and <b>mounting</b> <b>hardware</b> for large, low-slope commercial rooftops. The panels perform optimally when mounted horizontally and packed closely together, the company claimed, covering significantly {{more of the}} typically available roof area and producing more electricity per rooftop {{on an annual basis}} than a conventional panel installation.|$|E
50|$|Trixon was a {{drum and}} {{percussion}} instrument manufacturer, founded on September 18, 1947 by Karl-Heinz Weimer in Hamburg, Germany. Trixon drums are remarkable for their innovations in drum construction, including conical and ellipsoidal shaped shells, and unique designs in <b>mounting</b> <b>hardware.</b> Their product line eventually included vibraphones, xylophones, conga drums and many unique stands and fittings.|$|E
5000|$|In 1985 Linn {{released}} the LinnSequencer, a rack <b>mount</b> 32 track <b>hardware</b> MIDI sequencer. It {{used the same}} flawed operating system used in the Linn 9000. As a result, the machine earned a reputation for unreliability.|$|R
50|$|Safety gates {{are used}} to help prevent a child from {{accessing}} an area of a house, especially the stairway, or to allow an exterior door to be open for ventilation while restricting movement of a child. Pressure gates and <b>hardware</b> <b>mounted</b> gates are available. Pressure gates can be dislodged by children {{and should not be}} used at the top of stairs. In some situations, pressure gates at the top of stairs have caused serious injury when a child has run against it or when a parent has fallen trying to step over the gate. <b>Hardware</b> <b>mounted</b> gates are the most secure option and should be installed securely into wall studs.|$|R

50|$|<b>Mounting</b> <b>hardware</b> {{is a set}} {{of eight}} 10-32 UNF bolts, usually an Allen or Phillips head, and {{matching}} nylon locknuts. They are used to attach the trucks (and any type of risers) to the board. Some sets have one different colored bolt to show which side is the nose of the skateboard. Hardware is available in various lengths for mounting trucks with or without risers.|$|E
50|$|Most {{inclusions}} {{present in}} gem-quality diamonds do {{not affect the}} diamonds' performance or structural integrity. When set in jewelry, {{it may also be}} possible to hide certain inclusion behind <b>mounting</b> <b>hardware</b> such as prongs in a way that renders the defect invisible. However, large clouds can affect a diamond's ability to transmit and scatter light. Large cracks close to or breaking the surface may increase the likelihood of a fracture.|$|E
50|$|The {{auxiliary}} power comprises the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), the electronic control box (ECB), and <b>mounting</b> <b>hardware.</b> The APU in {{use on the}} A380 is the PW 980A APU. The APU primarily provides air to power the Analysis Ground Station (AGS) {{on the ground and}} to start the engines. The AGS is a semi-automatic analysis system of flight data that helps to optimise management of maintenance and reduce costs. The APU also powers electric generators which provide auxiliary electric power to the aircraft.|$|E
50|$|A Rack rail, or rack strip, {{is used to}} <b>mount</b> rackable {{electronic}} <b>hardware</b> and 19-inch {{rack mount}} accessories within a 19-inch rack.
