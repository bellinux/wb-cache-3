The incoming flow velocity upstream of the pipe and the bottom velocity in the scour hole were measured using an acoustic doppler velocimeter (ADV). Such flow measurements were used to investigate the variation of bottom velocity for different height of spoiler and gap. Furthermore, after the scour attained equilibrium, the section profiles of the scour hole were measured using a <b>measuring</b> <b>pin</b> with the minimum precision of 0.1  mm so as to obtain the angle of repose and verify the formulas.|$|E

However, in literature there are studies to indicate the existence of insider trading in this market (BOPP, 2003; BARBEDO; SILVA; LEAL, 2009). Therefore, this study aims to investigate the Probability of Informed Trading (PIN) in stock trading on the BM&FBOVESPA, trying to identify its relationship with stock returns. Based on Efficient Markets Theory and Agency Theory, we analyzed 198 stocks during the year 2011. The information asymmetry was <b>measured</b> (<b>PIN)</b> using the model of Easley, Hvidkjaer and O’Hara (2002) and related to stock returns through the model of Fama and MacBeth (1973) set.

Neither the geographical origin of the N corks nor the surface treatment to which the AG corks were subjected significantly affected the proposed models.

A novel approach that has gained much ground through new {{research is to}} retard the movement of an avalanche {{after it has been}} initiated, that is in its path or run out zone. Such systems have the potential to be more cost efficient than traditional structures such as avalanche protection dams, saving both time and space of installation.

In addition to the field tests, scaled granular experi-ments were performed in the laboratory. These tests show that the Snowcatcher leads to a significant reduction of avalanche velocities.

40|$|Understanding the {{electronic}} contact between molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2) and metal electrodes {{is vital for}} the realization of future MoS 2 -based electronic devices. Natural MoS 2 has the drawback of a high density of both metal and sulfur defects and impurities. We present evidence that subsurface metal-like defects with a density of ∼ 1011 cm– 2 induce negative ionization of the outermost S atom complex. We investigate with high-spatial-resolution surface characterization techniques {{the effect of these}} defects on the local conductance of MoS 2. Using metal nanocontacts (contact area < 6 nm 2), we find that subsurface metal-like defects (and not S-vacancies) drastically decrease the metal/MoS 2 Schottky barrier height as compared to that in the pristine regions. The magnitude of this decrease depends on the contact metal. The decrease of the Schottky barrier height is attributed to strong Fermi level pinning at the defects. Indeed, this is demonstrated in the <b>measured</b> <b>pinning</b> factor, which is equal to ∼ 0. 1 at defect locations and ∼ 0. 3 at pristine regions. Our findings are in good agreement with the theoretically predicted values. These defects provide low-resistance conduction paths in MoS 2 -based nanodevices and will play a prominent role as the device junction contact area decreases in size...|$|R

Results Gene expression patterns from NCI's panel of 60 cell lines were used to train a Random Forest, a Support Vector Machine and a Neural Network model, plus two over-sampled models for classifying genes to biological processes. Each model produced unique characteristics in the classification results. We introduce the Precision Index <b>measure</b> (<b>PIN)</b> from the maximum posterior probability that allows assessing, comparing and combining multiple classifiers. The class specific precision measure (PIC) is introduced and used to select a subset of predictions across all classes and all classifiers with high precision. We developed a single classifier that combines the PINs from these five models in prediction and found that the PIN Combined Classifier (PINCom) significantly increased the number of correctly predicted genes over any single classifier. The PINCom applied to test genes that were not used in training also showed substantial improvement over any single model. Conclusions This paper introduces novel and effective ways of assessing predictions by their precision and recall plus a method that combines several machine learning models and capitalizes on synergy and complementation in class selection, resulting in higher precision and recall. Different machine learning models yielded incongruent results each of which were successfully combined into one superior model using the <b>PIN</b> <b>measure</b> we developed.

40|$|Background: Radiotherapy {{is based}} on the premise of {{accurate}} dose delivery to target volumes within a patient, while minimizing dose to surrounding tissues. Recent developments in the treatment of breast cancer have focused on “gating” the delivery of the treatment beams to minimize the effect of patient motion during treatment, and increasing separation between the target volume and organs at risk (OAR), such as lung, heart and left anterior descending coronary artery. The basic principle involves rapidly switching the treatment beam on or off depending on the patient breathing cycle. It is therefore important to know the characteristics of gated treatments such as latency. Methods: In this work an electrical PIN diode circuit (EPDC) was designed for quality assurance (QA) purposes to examine beam latency timing properties. Evaluation of the EPDC was performed on a TrueBeam™ (Varian, Palo Alto) linear accelerator and its internal gating system. The EPDC was coupled to a moving stage to simulate a binary pattern with fast beam triggering within predefined limits, the so called “gating window”. Pulses of radiation were <b>measured</b> with the <b>PIN</b> diode and the results were compared to measurements of current produced across the linac target. Processing of the beam pulses and calculation of the latency timings was performed by an Atmega 328 P microcontroller. Results: For beam-on latencies, 2. 11 ms (6 MV) and 2. 12 ms (10 MV) were <b>measured</b> using the <b>PIN</b> diode, compared to 2. 13 ms (6 MV) and 2. 15 ms (10 MV) using the target current signal. For beam-off latencies, 57. 69 ms (6 MV) and 57. 73 ms (10 MV) were <b>measured</b> using the <b>PIN</b> diode, compared to 57. 33 ms (6 MV) and 56. 01 ms (10 MV) using the target current. Conclusions: PIN diodes can be used for accurate determination of the beam-on and beam-off latency characteristics, which could potentially lead to improvements in gated radiotherapy treatments, for example optimizing the gating windows and in estimating dosimetric errors associated with treatment beam latencies...|$|R

Here we compare morphometric measurements of scanned images of dragonfly wings to those obtained using other, more traditional, methods. We assume that the destructive method of removing and slide-mounting wings provides the most accurate method of measurement because it eliminates error due to wing curvature. We show that, for dragonfly wings, hand measurements of pinned specimens and digital measurements of scanned images are equally accurate relative to slide-mounted hand measurements. Since destructive slide-mounting is unsuitable for museum collections, and there is a risk of damage when hand <b>measuring</b> fragile <b>pinned</b> specimens, we suggest that the use of scanned images may also be an appropriate method to collect morphometric data from other collected insect species...|$|R
