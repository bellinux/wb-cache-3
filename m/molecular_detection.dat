50|$|Diagnosis of the {{bacterium}} in humans was traditionally based on clinical findings, {{and culture and}} seriological testing, but false negatives have been a problem due to easy death of P. multocida, and serology cannot differentiate between current infection and previous exposure. The quickest and most accurate method for confirming an active P. multocida infection is <b>molecular</b> <b>detection</b> using polymerase chain reaction.This bacterium can be effectively treated with β-lactam antibiotics, which inhibit cell wall synthesis. It can also be treated with fluoroquinolones or tetracyclines; fluoroquinolones inhibit bacterial DNA synthesis and tetracyclines interfere with protein synthesis by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit. Despite poor in vitro susceptibility results, macrolides (binding to the ribosome) also can be applied, certainly {{in the case of}} pulmonary complications. Due to the polymicrobial etiology of P. multocida infections, treatment requires the use of antimicrobials targeted at the elimination of both aerobic and anaerobic, Gram-negative bacteria. As a result, amoxicillin-clavulanate (a beta-lactamase inhibitor/penicillin combination) is seen as the treatment of choice.|$|E

50|$|Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) is {{a single}} tube, {{isothermal}} alternative to the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). By adding a reverse transcriptase enzyme to an RPA reaction it can detect RNA as well as DNA, {{without the need for}} a separate step to produce cDNA,. Because it is isothermal, RPA reactions need much simpler equipment than PCR, which needs a thermal cycler. Operating best at temperatures of 37-42 °C and still working, albeit more slowly, at room temperature means RPA reactions can in theory be run quickly simply by holding a tube. This makes RPA an excellent candidate for developing low-cost, rapid, point-of-care molecular tests.

5000|$|The {{important}} atomically precise clusters {{he discovered}} are: Ag7/8, Ag9, Au23, Ag152 [...] and the smallest molecular alloy, Ag7Au6.

Combining luminescent atomically precise clusters with mesoflowers and nanofibres, he developed sensors at sub-zeptomole levels [...] which are probably the limits of fast <b>molecular</b> <b>detection.</b> A single mesoflower {{has been shown to}} detect nine molecules of trinitrotoluene (TNT). A recent example of this chemistry is the detection of 80 ions of Hg2+ with single nanofibers. A number of atomically precise luminescent clusters have been made in proteins and their growth involves inter-protein metal transfer. These clusters were shown to be excellent biolabels. Early examples of cluster functionalisation were demonstrated by him and the methods he introduced are shown to impart properties such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer to such systems and these methodologies are now used for applications. Cluster functionalisation chemistry has recently been extended to make isomers of nanomolecules and these have been isolated in collaboration with Japanese scientists. He has recently demonstrated supramolecular functionalisation of clusters. Such clusters help assemble 1D nanostructures, leading to precise 3D structures.|$|E
