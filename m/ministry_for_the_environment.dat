5|$|A reformist, Dunstan brought {{profound}} {{change to}} South Australian society. His socially progressive administration saw Aboriginal land rights recognised, homosexuality decriminalised, {{the first female}} judge appointed, the first non-British governor, Sir Mark Oliphant, and later, the first indigenous governor Sir Douglas Nicholls. He enacted consumer protection laws, reformed and expanded the public education and health systems, abolished the death penalty, relaxed censorship and drinking laws, created a <b>ministry</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment,</b> enacted anti-discrimination law, and implemented electoral reforms such as the overhaul of the Legislative Council of parliament, lowered the voting age to 18, enacted universal suffrage, and completely abolished malapportionment, changes which gave him a less hostile parliament and allowed him to enact his reforms. He established Rundle Mall, enacted measures to protect buildings of historical heritage, and encouraged a flourishing of the arts, with support for the Adelaide Festival Centre, the State Theatre Company, {{and the establishment of}} the South Australian Film Corporation. He encouraged cultural exchanges with Asia, multiculturalism and an increase in the state's culinary awareness and sophistication. He is recognised for his role in reinvigorating the social, artistic and cultural life of South Australia during his nine years in office, remembered as the Dunstan Decade. However, there were also problems; the economy began to stagnate, and the large increases to burgeoning public service generated claims of waste. One of Dunstan's pet projects, a plan to build a new city at Monarto to alleviate urban pressures in Adelaide, was abandoned when economic and population growth stalled, with much money and planning already invested. After four consecutive election wins, Dunstan's administration began to falter in 1978 following his dismissal of Police Commissioner Harold Salisbury, as controversy broke out over whether he had improperly interfered with a judicial investigation. In addition, policy problems and unemployment began to mount, as well as unsubstantiated rumours of corruption and personal impropriety. Dunstan became increasingly short-tempered, and the strain was increased by the death of his second wife. His resignation from the premiership and politics in 1979 was abrupt after collapsing due to ill health, but he would live for another 20 years, remaining a vocal and outspoken campaigner for progressive social policy.|$|E

40|$|Historically, the New Zealand {{rationale}} behind air quality management {{has been to}} adopt an effects-based approach based on environmental impacts. Generally, this method has been efficient in that it permitted emitters {{to decide how to}} minimise and mitigate impacts. However, to address the inconsistencies in air quality management across New Zealand born of this approach, and to permit measures designed to improve the working of the Resource Management Act (RMA), National Environmental Standards for Ambient Air Quality have been developed and implemented to establish consistent regulation and protection for all New Zealanders. The standards were gazetted in September 2004, for full implementation by 2013. This thesis explores the implementation of the National Environmental Standards for Ambient Air Quality, examining the philosophy behind the standards and associated strategies for dealing with air pollution management in New Zealand, and <b>the</b> international context <b>for</b> <b>the</b> development of appropriate tools to address air quality concerns.
