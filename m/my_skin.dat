These series of works (<b>My</b> <b>Skins</b> 2005, Time Leap 2007-8) are {{the appropriation of}} her family past, an experiment {{with the nature of}} memory and post memory work. In <b>My</b> <b>Skins,</b> a series of leather curtains and leather wall carpets with embossing and pencil drawing, she used swine leather again, referring to childhood memory. After the 56 revolution in Hungary Csáky's grandfather was compelled to live in a self-maintaining farm where he also produced animal hides.

500|$|Lavigne {{eventually}} {{took on a}} more gothic {{style as}} she began her second album, Under <b>My</b> <b>Skin,</b> trading her skating outfits for black tutus and developing an image marked by angst.

She dyed her hair blonde with a pink streak, wore feminine outfits, including [...] "tight jeans and heels", and modelled for magazines such as Harper's Bazaar. Lavigne defended her new style: [...] "I don't really regret anything. You know, the ties and the wife-beaters and all... It had its time and place. And now I'm all grown up, and I've moved on".|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Tyler {{played the}} object of infatuation for three men (Matt Dillon, John Goodman, and Paul Reiser) in the comedy One Night at McCool's. In {{discussion}} of the role, {{she said it was}} [...] "definitely the first part where I had to be so physically aware and have people so aware of me physically. Maybe it's not hard for anybody else, but it is a bit for me. I mean I love my body and I feel very comfortable in <b>my</b> <b>skin</b> but this was tough." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "Tyler, a true beauty, gives the role a valiant try, but her range is too limited to play this amalgam of female perfection." ...|$|E
500|$|... Let Go {{had sold}} over 16 million copies worldwide, {{becoming}} Lavigne's highest-selling album to date. According to Billboard magazine, {{the album was}} the number 21 top-selling album of the decade. A Rolling Stone readers poll named Let Go as the fourth best album of the 2000s. The album is considered {{as one of the}} albums that changed the pop punk music scene, because it helped to bring pop punk music into the mainstream, contributing to the rise of female fronted pop punk bands and female-driven punk-influenced pop music. On 18 March 2013, Let Go was re-released as a double disc-set paired with her second studio album, Under <b>My</b> <b>Skin,</b> which is released under RCA Records.|$|E
