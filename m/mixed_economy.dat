5|$|The Nazi war {{economy was}} a <b>mixed</b> <b>economy</b> that {{combined}} {{a free market}} with central planning. Historian Richard Overy described it as being somewhere in between the command economy of the Soviet Union and the capitalist system of the United States.|$|E
50|$|As an {{economic}} ideal, <b>mixed</b> <b>economies</b> {{are supported by}} people of various political persuasions, typically centre-left and centre-right, such as social democrats or Christian Democrats. Supporters view <b>mixed</b> <b>economies</b> as a compromise between state socialism and free-market capitalism that is superior in net effect to either of those.|$|R
50|$|Economies {{ranging from}} the United States to Cuba have been catalogued as <b>mixed</b> <b>economies.</b> The term {{is also used to}} {{describe}} the economies of countries which are referred to as welfare states, such as the Nordic countries.

5|$|The United States has a {{capitalist}} <b>mixed</b> <b>economy</b> which {{is fueled by}} abundant natural resources and high productivity. According to the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. GDP of $16.8 trillion constitutes 24% of the gross world product at market exchange rates and over 19% of the gross world product at purchasing power parity (PPP).|$|E
5|$|The {{party had}} no strong {{economic}} preferences, and generally supported a <b>mixed</b> <b>economy.</b> While it supported privatisation and tax reductions for small and medium businesses, it also sometimes supported protectionism and defended the welfare state, especially if {{allocated to the}} native Flemish population.|$|E
5|$|The party's {{economic}} policies did not deviate substantially from the generally supported <b>mixed</b> <b>economy</b> of the Netherlands. Its other demands {{did not have}} a strong ideological coherency. Supporting a generous welfare state for the Dutch people, it was otherwise sceptical of state interventionism in the economy; notably by high taxes which would hinder private initiative, or overspending on subsidies.|$|E

5|$|Food {{production}} at Gedi likely involved a <b>mixed</b> <b>economy</b> based on livestock, {{as well as}} agricultural and horticultural production. Some foods were introduced through trade. Available crops included millet, African rice, cocoyam, coconuts, bananas, citrus fruits, pomegranates, figs, sugar cane, cotton, and various vegetables, while the principal livestock was likely cattle. Sheep, goats, and chickens {{played an important role}} as well.|$|E
5|$|By the 1950s, Keynesian {{policies}} were adopted by {{almost the entire}} developed world and similar measures for a <b>mixed</b> <b>economy</b> were used by many developing nations. By then, Keynes's views on the economy had become mainstream in the world's universities. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the developed and emerging free capitalist economies enjoyed exceptionally high growth and low unemployment. Professor Gordon Fletcher has written that the 1950s and 1960s, when Keynes's influence was at its peak, appear in retrospect as a golden age of capitalism.|$|E
5|$|Dubček's reforms {{guaranteed}} {{freedom of}} the press, and political commentary was allowed {{for the first time}} in mainstream media. At the time of the Prague Spring, Czechoslovak exports were declining in competitiveness, and Dubček's reforms planned to solve these troubles by mixing planned and market economies. Within the party, there were varying opinions on how this should proceed; certain economists wished for a more <b>mixed</b> <b>economy</b> while others wanted the economy to remain mostly planned. Dubček continued to stress the importance of economic reform proceeding under Communist Party rule.|$|E
50|$|Another key {{difference}} is that command economies are usually authoritarian in nature, whereas economic planning in general can be either participatory and democratic or authoritarian. Indicative planning {{is a form of}} planning in market economies that directs the economy through incentive-based methods. Economic planning can be practiced in a decentralized manner through different government authorities. For example, in some predominately market-oriented and <b>mixed</b> <b>economies,</b> the state utilizes economic planning in strategic industries such as the aerospace industry. <b>Mixed</b> <b>economies</b> usually employ macroeconomic planning, while micro-economic affairs are left to the market and price system.|$|R

5|$|Palmyra's economy {{before and}} at the {{beginning}} of the Roman period was based on agriculture, pastoralism, trade, and serving as a rest station for the caravans which sporadically crossed the desert. By the end of the first century BC, the city had a <b>mixed</b> <b>economy</b> based on agriculture, pastoralism, taxation, and, most importantly, the caravan trade. Taxation was an important source of revenue for the Palmyrene government. Caravaneers paid taxes in the building known as the Tariff Court, where a tax law dating to AD 137 was exhibited. The law regulated the tariffs paid by the merchants for goods sold at the internal market or exported from the city.|$|E
5|$|The Economy of Scotland had an {{estimated}} nominal {{gross domestic product}} (GDP) of up to £152 billion in 2015. In 2014, Scotland's per capita GDP {{was one of the}} highest in the EU.

Traditionally, the Scottish economy has been dominated by heavy industry underpinned by shipbuilding in Glasgow, coal mining and steel industries. Petroleum related industries associated with the extraction of North Sea oil have also been important employers from the 1970s, especially in the north-east of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|The Keynesian Revolution was {{associated}} with the rise of modern liberalism in the West during the post-war period. Keynesian ideas became so popular that some scholars point to Keynes as representing the ideals of modern liberalism, as Adam Smith represented the ideals of classical liberalism. After the war, Winston Churchill attempted to check the rise of Keynesian policy-making in the United Kingdom and used rhetoric critical of the <b>mixed</b> <b>economy</b> in his 1945 election campaign. Despite his popularity as a war hero, Churchill suffered a landslide defeat to Clement Attlee whose government's economic policy continued to be influenced by Keynes's ideas.|$|E

50|$|The Congress {{strongly}} endorses a <b>mixed</b> Capital <b>economy</b> {{in which}} both {{the private sector and}} the state direct the economy, reflecting characteristics of both market economies and planned economies. A leading economic theory advocated by the modern Tamil Nadu Congress party is import substitution industrialisation that advocates replacing foreign imports with domestic production.

5|$|Hitler was {{appointed}} Chancellor of Germany by the President of the Weimar Republic Paul von Hindenburg on 30 January 1933. The Nazi Party {{then began to}} eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power. Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the powers and offices of the Chancellery and Presidency. A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole Führer (leader) of Germany. All power was centralised in Hitler's person and his word became above all laws. The government was not a coordinated, co-operating body, but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler's favour. In {{the midst of the}} Great Depression, the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a <b>mixed</b> <b>economy.</b> Extensive public works were undertaken, including the construction of Autobahnen (motorways). The return to economic stability boosted the regime's popularity.|$|E
5|$|Ryzhkov's Plan and The 500 Days Programme were broadly similar, {{with both}} {{supporting}} price liberalisation, decentralisation and privatisation. The main {{difference between the}} two was Ryzhkov's desire to retain much of the social security system, free education for all and the continuance of a strong central government apparatus. The 500 Days Programme did not mention political union with the other Soviet republics, but instead weakened the authority of the central government by establishing a market economy. In other words, they left the question of continuing or dissolving the Soviet Union open. On 17 September in a meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev openly supported the 500 Days Programme, claiming it would not lead to the reestablishment of capitalism, but instead to a <b>mixed</b> <b>economy</b> where private enterprise played an important role.|$|E

50|$|Most {{forms and}} {{derivatives}} of Marxism and anarchism advocated total or near-total socialization of the economy. Less radical schools (e.g. Bernsteinism, reformism, reformist Marxism) proposed a <b>mixed</b> market <b>economy</b> instead. <b>Mixed</b> <b>economies,</b> in turn, can range anywhere from those {{developed by the}} social democratic governments that have periodically governed Northern and Western European countries, to the inclusion of small cooperatives in the planned economy of Yugoslavia under Josip Broz Tito.
