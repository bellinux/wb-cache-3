5|$|As the Word, Jesus was {{eternally}} {{present with}} God, active in all creation, {{and the source}} of humanity's <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> <b>spiritual</b> nature. Jesus is not only greater than any past human prophet but greater than any prophet could be. He not only speaks God's Word; he is God's Word. In the Gospel of John, Jesus reveals his divine role publicly. Here he is the Bread of Life, the Light of the World, the True Vine and more.|$|E
5|$|Three core {{principles}} {{establish a}} basis for Bahá'í teachings and doctrine: the unity of God, the unity of religion, and the unity of humanity. From these postulates stems the belief that God periodically reveals his will through divine messengers, whose purpose is to transform the character of humankind and to develop, within those who respond, <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> <b>spiritual</b> qualities. Religion is thus seen as orderly, unified, and progressive from age to age.|$|E

5|$|The use of {{elephants}} in such fashion {{went beyond the}} common royal power to dispense life and death. Elephants have long been used as symbols of royal authority (and still are in some places, such as Thailand, where white elephants are held in reverence). Their use as instruments of state power sent {{the message that the}} ruler was able to preside over very powerful creatures who were under total command. The ruler was thus seen as maintaining a <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> <b>spiritual</b> domination over wild beasts, adding to their authority and mystique among subjects.|$|E
5|$|Knox's {{death was}} barely noticed at the time. Although his funeral was {{attended}} by the nobles of Scotland, no major politician or diplomat mentioned his death in their letters that survive. Mary, Queen of Scots made only two brief references to him in her letters. However, what the rulers feared were Knox's ideas more than Knox himself. He was a ruthless and successful revolutionary {{and it was this}} revolutionary philosophy that had a great impact on the English Puritans. Despite his strictness and dogmatism, he has also been described by partisans as contributing to the struggle for genuine human freedom, by teaching a duty to oppose unjust government in order to bring about <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> <b>spiritual</b> change.|$|E

25|$|Stanford University {{political}} scientist Professor Rob Reich wrote in The Civic Perils of Homeschooling (2002) that homeschooling can probably result in biased students, as many homeschooling parents view {{the education of}} their children as a matter properly under their control and no one else's.

In the Bahá'í view, since humanity's spiritual capacity and receptivity has increased over time, the extant to which these spiritual truths are expounded changes.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Ruskin {{was making}} the {{extensive}} sketches and notes that he used for his three-volume work, The Stones of Venice (1851–53). Developing from a technical history of Venetian architecture, from the Romanesque to the Renaissance, into a broad cultural history, Stones also reflected Ruskin's view of contemporary England. It acted as a warning about the <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> <b>spiritual</b> health of society. Ruskin argued that Venice had slowly deteriorated. Its cultural achievements had been compromised, and its society corrupted, by the decline of true Christian faith. Instead of revering the divine, Renaissance artists honoured themselves, arrogantly celebrating human sensuousness.|$|E
25|$|In 1754 Woolman {{published}} Some Considerations on the Keeping of Negroes. He {{continued to}} refuse to draw up wills that bequeathed ownership of slaves to heirs. Over time, and working on a personal level, he individually convinced many Quaker slaveholders to free their slaves. As Woolman traveled, when he accepted hospitality from a slaveholder, he insisted on paying the slaves for their work in attending him. He refused to be served with silver cups, plates, and utensils, as he believed that slaves in other regions were forced to dig such precious minerals and gems for the rich. He observed that some owners used the labor of their slaves to enjoy lives of ease, which he {{found to be the}} worst situation not only for the slaves, but for the <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> <b>spiritual</b> condition of the owners. He could condone those owners who treated their slaves gently, or worked alongside them.|$|E
25|$|Pierre Bezukhov, upon finally {{receiving}} {{his massive}} inheritance, is suddenly {{transformed from a}} bumbling young man into the most eligible bachelor in the Russian Empire. Despite knowing that it is wrong, he is convinced into marriage with Prince Kuragin's beautiful and immoral daughter Hélène (Elena Vasilyevna Kuragina). Hélène, who is rumoured {{to be involved in}} an incestuous affair with her brother Anatol, tells Pierre that she will never have children with him. Hélène is also rumoured to have an affair with Dolokhov, who mocks Pierre in public. Pierre loses his temper and challenges Dolokhov to a duel. Unexpectedly (because Dolokhov is a seasoned dueller), Pierre wounds Dolokhov. Hélène denies her affair, but Pierre is convinced of her guilt and leaves her. In his <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> <b>spiritual</b> confusion, Pierre joins the Freemasons. Much of Book Two concerns his struggles with his passions and his spiritual conflicts. He abandons his former carefree behavior and enters upon a philosophical quest particular to Tolstoy: how should one live a moral life in an ethically imperfect world? The question continually baffles Pierre. He attempts to liberate his serfs, but ultimately achieves nothing of note.|$|E

25|$|While {{objective}} truths are {{final and}} static, subjective truths are continuing and dynamic. The truth of one's existence is a living, inward, and subjective {{experience that is}} always {{in the process of}} becoming. The values, <b>morals,</b> <b>and</b> <b>spiritual</b> approaches a person adopts, while not denying the existence of objective truths of those beliefs, can only become truly known when they have been inwardly appropriated through subjective experience. Thus, Kierkegaard criticizes all systematic philosophies which attempt to know life or the truth of existence via theories and objective knowledge about reality. As Kierkegaard claims, human truth is something that is continually occurring, and a human being cannot find truth separate from the subjective experience of one's own existing, defined by the values and fundamental essence that consist of one's way of life.|$|R
25|$|As {{early as}} 1770 Voght {{had come in}} contact with prisons, when, {{representing}} his father, he had shown the English prison reformer John Howard around Hamburg's penitentiary. From that time he maintained a great interest in matters related to poorhouses and prisons. Together {{with the head of the}} trade academy (Handelsakademie) Johann Georg Büsch and the lawyer Johann Arnold Günther, Voght initiated in 1788 the establishment of a 'common institution for the poor' (Allgemeinen Armenanstalt) with which he reformed Hamburg's poor provision. The foundation of this reform was the division of the city into care zones whose approximately 200 inhabitants were entrusted with finding voluntary means of caring for the poor in that zone. The institute guaranteed medical attention for the poor, support during pregnancy and childbirth, and education and work for poor children. In contrast to the prevailing mode of providing for the poor, which was usually ecclesiastical and focused on <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> <b>spiritual</b> aspects of the situation, the reform was directed towards the economic needs of those affected. The cost of the effort was met by tithes collected in churches and weekly collections for the poor. As a result of this effort, the number of occupants in Hamburg's penitentiaries sank drastically.|$|E
500|$|It {{was then}} that the 19-year-old Bukovsky wrote his {{critical}} notes on the Communist Youth League or Komsomol. Later this text was given the title [...] "Theses on the Collapse of the Komsomol" [...] by the KGB. Bukovsky portrayed the USSR as an [...] "illegal society" [...] facing an acute ideological crisis. The Komsomol was [...] "moribund", he asserted, having lost both <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> <b>spiritual</b> authority, and he called for its democratisation. This text and his other activities brought Bukovsky {{to the attention of}} the authorities. He was interrogated twice before being thrown out of the university in autumn 1961.|$|E
500|$|After {{the death}} of Henry Bates Grubb, the estate was managed by his widow, Harriet Amelia Buckley Grubb, until her {{children}} reached adulthood. In 184849, {{at a cost of}} about $2,000, she had an Episcopal church, known today as [...] "Hope Church", erected on the property, [...] "for the <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> <b>spiritual</b> uplift of the tenants on her estate and the employees of the Mount Hope Furnace". In 1885, Clement Brooke Grubb, one of Henry's sons, purchased the mansion and surrounding land for $300,000 from the heirs of his younger brother, Alfred Bates Grubb. That October, Clement gave the church and churchyard to the Episcopal Diocese of Central Pennsylvania.|$|E
