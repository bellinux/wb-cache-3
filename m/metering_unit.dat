He was having {{problems}} with his fuel <b>metering</b> <b>unit,</b> and fuel was pumping directly onto the engine, which then caught fire. Zorzi did not immediately get out of his car as he could not disconnect the oxygen pipe from his helmet.|$|E
25|$|The {{means of}} {{securing}} the oil <b>metering</b> <b>unit</b> to the no. 2 cabin blower became ineffective and {{this led to}} the initiation of a fire within the blower, which propagated to the wing fuel tank and substantially reduced the strength of the main spar upper boom. It is probable that the separation of the oil <b>metering</b> <b>unit</b> arose from an out-of-balance condition induced by rotor break-up but the source of the rotor break-up could not be determined.|$|E
2500|$|When an oil <b>metering</b> <b>unit</b> was {{installed}} on a cabin pressurisation blower, locking wire {{was used to}} ensure the five securing nuts did not rotate and become loose. [...] In the wreckage of number 2 cabin blower accident investigators found none of the nuts and no locking wire. [...] The investigators believed that when the blower was last overhauled the oil <b>metering</b> <b>unit</b> may have been re-attached without locking wire securing the nuts. [...] The blower was overhauled and then installed on VH-RMI in April 1966.|$|E

2500|$|The {{investigation}} {{discovered that}} a couple of years earlier, fires had occurred in one of the cabin pressurisation blowers on a Vickers Viscount in Canada and another in the British West Indies. [...] Both fires broke out after loosening of the nuts securing the oil <b>metering</b> <b>unit</b> to the blower. [...] Both occurred during testing of the engine on the ground. [...] At the time, the blower manufacturer was not advised. [...] It was not until the crash of Flight 149 in Australia that the blower manufacturer became aware of the need for these cabin pressurisation blowers to be modified.|$|E
2500|$|There was initial {{speculation}} as {{to whether}} the accident was caused by a driver error or a deflating rear tyre, and the Lotus was investigated thoroughly by aircraft crash investigators for three weeks. Many drivers including Surtees and Brabham were convinced that the crash was caused by a deflating rear tyre and were adamant {{that it was not a}} driver error—simply because they believed Clark was not capable of making such a mistake. According to Andrew Marriott of the classic journal Motor Sport who was covering the race as a young reporter [...] "Deaths in the sport were a regular occurrence in those days, but surely someone of Clark's sublime talent and skill? People reckoned that the rear tyre had deflated, and there is another theory that the mechanical <b>metering</b> <b>unit</b> [...] on the Cosworth FVA engine had seized and caused Clark to crash." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since its {{introduction}} the AW119 Koala {{has developed a}} reputation as one of the safest helicopters in its class. Nicknamed [...] "Volvo of light helicopters" [...] by operators and technicians, it has proven a forgiving platform when exposed to extreme conditions and operational tempos. The AW119 incorporates a level of system redundancy unparalleled in its class; a few examples being: duel hydraulic pumps driven directly by its main rotor transmission on opposite sides, two separate stability augmentation systems, electronic engine control system coupled with a direct throttle control linkage to fuel <b>metering</b> <b>unit</b> and mechanical governor allowing for a MANUAL mode, two fuel tank boost pumps in addition to engine driven fuel pump, two heading GMU sensors, two independent VHF systems available, and primary and secondary GPS sources. A high-inertia rotor system coupled with a robust box structure and separated fuel bladder tank setup has contributed greatly to crash survivability.|$|E
50|$|After signing on, {{the hand}} held unit {{generally}} reads a meter description. This describes some registers that describe the current count of <b>metered</b> <b>units</b> (i.e. kilowatt hours, megajoules, litres of gas or water) and the <b>metering</b> <b>unit's</b> reliability (is it still operating ok?). Occasionally a manufacturer will invent a new quantity to measure, {{and in this}} case, a new or different data type {{will appear in the}} meter definition. Most <b>metering</b> <b>units</b> have special modes for calibration and resetting meter registers. These modes are usually protected by anti-tampering features such as switches that sense if the meter enclosure has been opened.|$|R

2500|$|The {{investigation}} eventually {{determined that}} the rotors in the cabin pressurisation blower on number 2 engine began to break up, resulting in severe vibration that loosened the nuts securing the oil <b>metering</b> <b>unit</b> to the blower and allowed oil to escape freely. [...] The rear bearing {{of one of the}} rotors also came free, so the rotor gyrated, causing metal-to-metal contact and great heat. [...] The blower was located aft of the firewall, and a fire started {{in the rear of the}} nacelle when the escaping oil was ignited by contact with the hot metal in the damaged blower. The fire burned the engine control rods, preventing feathering of the propeller. [...] Burning oil flowed into the wheel bay and from there into the leading edge of the left wing, where the fire breached the wall of a fuel tank. The abundant supply of fuel caused the fire to spread throughout much of the left wing and become so intense it caused softening of aluminium alloy and loss of strength of the upper boom (or upper flange) in the wing spar. The spar was critically weakened in the region between number 1 and 2 engines.|$|E

5000|$|... 1975 {{began with}} a bang, as he put his Shadow DN5 on pole {{position}} for the Argentine Grand Prix, only for a component to break in the warm-up, preventing Jarier from taking the start. He repeated the feat at the Brazilian Grand Prix, and then dominated the race until a fuel <b>metering</b> <b>unit</b> failed, ending his race. Bad luck and poor reliability would curse his season, though the Shadow team fell from the pace as well. His only points-scoring finish was for 4th place in the shortened Spanish Grand Prix.|$|E

50|$|General Electric's Model 307 was a {{miniaturized}} AC {{network analyzer}} with four generator units {{and a single}} electronically amplified <b>metering</b> <b>unit.</b> It was targeted at utility companies to solve problems too large for hand computation but not worth the expense of renting time on a full size analyzer. Like the Iowa State College analyzer, it used a system frequency of 10 kHz instead of 60 Hz or 480 Hz, allowing much smaller radio-style capacitor and inductors {{to be used to}} model power system components. The 307 was cataloged from 1957 and had a list of about 20 utility, educational and government customers. In 1959 its list price was $8,590.|$|E
50|$|Niki Lauda {{dominated}} practice, with teammate Clay Regazzoni joining him on {{the front}} row. Jean-Pierre Jarier had a crash and the Maki team's weekend ended abruptly {{in a cloud of}} smoke from engine problems. James Hunt had a storming practice to take third place on the grid. On Saturday afternoon, weather conditions meant practice times would not improve, so Hunt was sent out to get some extra testing - during which something in the <b>metering</b> <b>unit</b> broke. This was fortunate as the Dutch Grand Prix did not have Sunday morning practice, so {{had it not been for}} those extra laps, the mechanical problems would have occurred during the race itself.|$|E
50|$|The {{race was}} delayed by rainstorms as the teams persuaded the {{organizers}} {{to let them}} run on wet tyres. Lauda led from Jody Scheckter whilst Vittorio Brambilla and Patrick Depailler collided. Jochen Mass was having <b>metering</b> <b>unit</b> troubles and Jacky Ickx exploded his engine. Meanwhile, Hunt had changed onto dry tyres and was gaining time rapidly on the drying surface {{to take the lead}} from Jarier and Lauda by lap 15. The Austrian championship leader was finding overtaking a very difficult prospect indeed. Emerson Fittipaldi dropped out with engine problems whilst John Watson broke a wing support and Carlos Reutemann got past Tom Pryce who was suffering from brake problems.|$|E
