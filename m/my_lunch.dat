2500|$|Besides {{having a}} bad temper, LaLanne also {{suffered}} from headaches and bulimia, and temporarily {{dropped out of high}} school at age 14. The following year, at age 15, he heard health food pioneer Paul Bragg give a talk on health and nutrition, focusing on the [...] "evils of meat and sugar". Bragg's message had a powerful influence on LaLanne, who then changed his life and started focusing on his diet and exercise. In his own words, he was [...] "born again", and besides his new focus on nutrition, he began working out daily (although earlier, while serving during World War II as a Pharmacist Mate First Class at the Sun Valley Naval Convalescent Hospital, LaLanne stated that he started in bodybuilding at [...] "age 13"). Describing his change of diet, LaLanne stated, [...] "I had to take <b>my</b> <b>lunch</b> alone to the football field to eat so no one would see me eat my raw veggies, whole bread, raisins and nuts. You don't know the crap I went through." ...|$|E
2500|$|Leadbeater {{played for}} Yorkshire County Cricket Club as a middle-order batsman from 1966 to 1979, {{although}} {{he preferred to}} open the innings. His promise went largely unfulfilled; his average of 25.34 in 147 first-class matches (the norm for a county cricketer of the period was around 30.00), scoring just one century. The highlight of his playing career was a man-of-the-match winning 76 in the 1969 Gillette Cup Final, a match {{in which he was}} not expected to play. Leadbeater broke a finger in the County Championship game the day before, and would have been omitted had Geoffrey Boycott not suffered a worse injury. Leadbeater said: [...] "I almost forgot about the fact that I had a broken finger. Then when it came to lunchtime, I was changing my clothing because of perspiration, and ate <b>my</b> <b>lunch</b> in a jockstrap and left batting glove! I couldn’t get the glove off because my finger had swollen. I can't get m' breath!" [...] Leadbeater posted a top score of 90 in 106 one day games. Leadbeater was touted by Colin Cowdrey (amongst others) as a future Test match cricketer. However, batting lower down the order and a shin injury in 1970 meant that Leadbeater failed to score enough runs to impress the selectors.|$|E

6000|$|It was Norah herself {{who broke}} {{to me the}} news of Barbara's elopement with Hal. I had seen neither of them since my return to London. Old Hasluck {{a month or so}} before I had met in the City one day by chance, and he had insisted on <b>my</b> <b>lunching</b> with him. I had found him greatly changed. His buoyant self-assurance had deserted him; in its place a fretful eagerness had become his motive force. At first he had talked boastingly: Had I seen the Post for last Monday, the Court Circular for the week before? Had I read that Barbara had danced with the Crown Prince, that the Count and Countess Huescar had been {{entertaining}} a Grand Duke? What [duplicated line of text] I think of that! and such like.

60|$|This generous offer sent me away {{filled with}} {{gratitude}} and an illogical hope.

60|$|In {{the matter}} of food and {{clothing}} I was scarcely considered. Any of Gus's cast-off suits were thought {{good enough for the}} office, and my Sunday suit was two years old.

40|$|The {{past two}} years have been {{two of the most}} {{difficult}} I have faced. My journey as a student has nearly ended on numerous occasions, and {{if it were not for}} a few close people in my life I am not sure this paper could have been written. First of all I need to give massive thanks to Brian Harper who stepped up after my admitted hiatus of the brain, helped me get back on track and agreed to be my Committee Chair within the first thirty minutes of meeting me. Plus? You are HILARIOUS. THANK YOU. Secondly, I would like to give thanks to Stephen Duffy who has, on several occasions, paid for <b>my</b> <b>lunches,</b> software, and travel, and cracked me up in response to things I probably was not supposed to be laughing at. I am pretty sure that without you, my graduate school experience would have been completely different and sucked a whole helluva lot more. And even though you’re not here (insert squinty, menacing eyes here), I want to thank my academic advisor and resident statistical genius, Dr. Joshua Bagaka’s. I really don’t know if I could have made it through stats without you. What a teacher you are...|$|R
