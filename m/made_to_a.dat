5|$|Cynesige (died 22 December 1060) was {{a medieval}} English Archbishop of York between 1051 and 1060. Prior to his {{appointment}} to York, {{he was a}} royal clerk and perhaps a monk at Peterborough. As archbishop, he built and adorned his cathedral {{as well as other}} churches, and was active in consecrating bishops. After his death in 1060, the bequests he had <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> monastery were confiscated by the queen.|$|E
5|$|Etty had {{intended}} to travel to England, but instead remained in Paris, to resume copying works in Paris galleries, collecting prints and buying a lay figure and around 200 paintbrushes, both of which the French <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> higher standard than English manufacturers. In early January 1824, Etty finally returned to London.|$|E
5|$|The Plain English Campaign {{was set up}} in 1979 {{when the}} founder, Chrissie Maher, {{shredded}} hundreds of jargon-filled forms and documents in Parliament Square, London. The group made their first awards the next year, rewarding those organisations that used plain English, and highlighting those that did not. Although the Foot in Mouth award was first made in 1993, a specific acknowledgment was <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> comment by Dan Quayle, Vice President of the United States in 1991.|$|E

5|$|In 1844, {{an organ}} by Gray & Davison of London was {{installed}} in the cathedral, replacing an instrument with parts dating back to 1626. The organ was rebuilt and enlarged by Whiteley Bros of Chester in 1876, to include harmonic flutes and reeds by Cavaillé-Coll. It was later moved to its present position {{at the front of}} the north transept. In 1910 William Hill and Son of London extensively rebuilt and revoiced the organ, replacing the Cavaillé-Coll reeds with new pipes of their own. The choir division of the organ was enlarged and moved behind the choirstalls on the south side. The instrument was again overhauled by Rushworth and Dreaper of Liverpool in 1969, when a new mechanism and some new pipework <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> design by the organist, Roger Fisher, was installed. Since 1991 the organ has been in the care of David Wells of Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} or durability of heavy metals such as chromium, iron, nickel, copper, zinc, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and lead, {{as well as}} their alloys, makes them useful for the manufacture of artefacts such as tools, machinery, appliances, utensils, pipes, railroad tracks, buildings and bridges, automobiles, locks, furniture, ships, planes, coinage and jewellery. They are also used as alloying additives for enhancing the properties of other metals. Of the two dozen elements that have been used in the world's monetised coinage only two, carbon and aluminium, are not heavy metals. Gold, silver, and platinum are used in jewellery as are (for example) nickel, copper, indium, and cobalt in coloured gold. Low-cost jewellery and children's toys may be <b>made,</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> significant degree, of heavy metals such as chromium, nickel, cadmium, or lead.|$|E

5|$|Though the Clash {{continued}} to tour, tension {{continued to}} increase. In early 1983, Chimes left the band after the Combat Rock Tour because of in-fighting and turmoil. He {{was replaced by}} Pete Howard for the US Festival in San Bernardino, California, which the Clash co-headlined, along with David Bowie and Van Halen. The band argued with the event's promoters over inflated ticket prices, threatening to pull out unless a large donation was <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> local charity. The group ultimately performed on 28 May, the festival's New Music Day, which drew a crowd of 140,000. After the show, members of the band brawled with security staff. This was Jones' last appearance with the group: in September 1983, he was fired. Shortly thereafter, he became {{a founding member of}} General Public, but left that band as they were recording their first album.|$|E
