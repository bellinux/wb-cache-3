40|$|Abstract. The {{spectra of}} the {{quiescent}} counterparts to the Soft Gamma-Ray Repeaters SGR 1900 + 14 and SGR 1806 – 20 {{peak in the}} infrared. Their infrared spectra appear to contain several components: the photospheric emission from star(s) dominates at shorter wavelengths, a bright point source dominates at 25 µm, while an extended source dominates at 60 µm. However, we show here that these counterparts were not detected by the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope at 450 µm or 800 µm. These observations are consistent with other millimeter studies, and {{are consistent with the}} detection of a point-like “core ” to the radio nebula of SGR 1806 – 20.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the project {{is to develop a}} general-purpose, user-friendly computerized database and code package, for the PC as well as larger computers, which can be used for the routine prediction of the absorbed dose from incident electrons and their secondary bremsstrahlung (and from incident protons) as functions of the thickness of aluminum shielding in space. The assumption of homogeneous aluminum shields and of isotropic incident fluxes (at least in a time-averaged sense) allows for the rather reliable conversion of doses in slabs to those in other simple bodies, such as spherical and cylindrical solids and shells. On such a basis, depth-dose data for <b>monoenergetic</b> incident <b>radiation</b> can be generated once-and-for-all from accurate transport calculations, and this database can then be used repeatedly in rapid dose predictions for arbitrary radiation spectra and for a variety of spacecraft sizes and shapes, without recourse to the very time-consuming Monte Carlo calculations.

40|$|In mammography, {{the image}} {{contrast}} and dose {{delivered to the}} patient {{are determined by the}} x-ray spectrum and the scatter to primary ratio S/P. Thus the quality of the mammographic procedure is highly dependent on the choice of anode and filter material and on the method used {{to reduce the amount of}} scattered radiation reaching the detector. Synchrotron radiation is a useful tool to study the effect of beam energy on the optimization of the mammographic process because it delivers a high flux of monochromatic photons. Moreover, because the beam is naturally flat collimated in one direction, a slot can be used instead of a grid for scatter reduction. We have measured the ratio S/P and the transmission factors for grids and slots for <b>monoenergetic</b> synchrotron <b>radiation.</b> In this way the effect of beam energy and scatter rejection method were separated, and their respective importance for image quality and dose analyzed.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{leading to}} the production of hollow K shell atoms via single photon impact were investigated for a variety of light elements with 12  ≤  Z  ≤  23. The double 1 s vacancy states were produced by irradiating the samples with intense <b>monoenergetic</b> synchrotron <b>radiation</b> beams. The double-to-single K -shell photoionization probabilities P KK and the absolute double K -shell photoionization cross sections σ ²⁺ were determined by measuring with a high-resolution bent von Hamos crystal spectrometer the Kα h hypersatellite X-ray emission of the samples. The measurements were performed over a wide range of incoming photon energies from threshold up to energies beyond the broad maximum of the double-to-single photoionization cross section ratios. The P KK and σ ²⁺ were determined from the relative yields of the resolved Kα h hypersatellite lines. For Mg, Al and Si, the two-electron one-photon (TEOP) Kαα h transitions which represent an alternative but much weaker decay channel for double 1 s vacancy states could be also observed, using a highly efficient flat crystal wavelength dispersive spectrometer. This observation of single photon-induced TEOP transitions has shown that the I (Kα h) / I (Kαα h) branching ratios are very poorly reproduced by most of existing theoretical models. Besides the relative yields of the hypersatellite and TEOP transitions, the energies and natural linewidths of the Kα h and Kαα h X-ray lines were also determined. The energies are found to be in good agreement with different theoretical predictions, whereas the linewidths are significantly underestimated by the calculations, except if non-lifetime broadening effects such as the outer-shell ionization and the open valence configuration are taken into consideration...|$|R

Much attention has been focused on the imaging of small objects of weakly attenuating materials at optimum value. At optimum value it is possible to calculate the three-dimensional representation of inner and outer surfaces of the object.

40|$|Devices {{based on}} {{scintillation}} detector are highly sensitive to photon radiation and {{are widely used}} to measure the environment dose rate. Modernization of the measuring path to minimize the error in measuring the response of the detector to gamma radiation has already reached its technological ceiling and does not give the proper effect. More promising for this purpose are new methods of processing the obtained spectrometric information. The purpose of this work is the development of highly sensitive instruments based on scintillation detection units using a spectrometric method for calculating dose rate. In this paper we consider the spectrometric method of dosimetry of gamma radiation based on the transformation of the measured instrumental spectrum. Using predetermined or measured functions of the detector response to the action of gamma radiation of a given energy and flux density, a certain function of the energy G(E) is determined. Using this function as the core of the integral transformation from the field to dose characteristic, it is possible to obtain the dose value directly from the current instrumentation spectrum. Applying the function G(E) to the energy distribution of the fluence of photon radiation in the environment, the total dose rate can be determined without information on the distribution of radioisotopes in the environment. To determine G(E) by Monte-Carlo method instrumental response function of the scintillator detector to <b>monoenergetic</b> photon <b>radiation</b> sources as well as other characteristics are calculated. Then the whole full-scale energy range is divided into energy ranges for which the function G(E) is calculated using a linear interpolation.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a novel comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation code, ARTEMIS, for the investigation of electron-hole pair transport mechanisms in a-Se x-ray imaging detectors. ARTEMIS allows for modeling of spatiotemporal carrier transport in a-Se, combining an existing Monte Carlo simulation package, PENELOPE, for simulation of x-ray and secondary electron interactions and new routines for electron-hole pair transport with three-dimensional spatiotemporal signal output considering the effects of applied electric field. The detector Swank factor, an important imaging performance metric is calculated from simulated pulse-height spectra and shown to depend on incident x-ray energy and applied electric field. Simulation results are compared to experimental measurements and are found to agree within 2 %. Clinical x-ray spectra are also used to study detector performance in terms of energy weighting and electronic noise. Simulation results show energy-weighting effects are taken into account in the ARTEMIS model, where the Swank factor and DQE have a higher dependence on the high-energy incident x rays due to increased carrier yield. Electronic noise is found to widen the pulse-height spectra and degrade the Swank factor. The effect of recombination algorithms and burst models are studied. A comparison of a first-hit algorithm and a nearest-neighbor approach shows {{no significant difference in the}} simulation output while achieving reduced simulation time. The examination of the initial generation of carriers in the burst shows that the recombination efficiency of carriers is dependent on the carrier density and electric field. Finally, the spatial resolution characteristics of a flat-panel a-Se detector are studied by using the ARTEMIS model for spatial output and image generation.

A new approach is developed to estimate the solid angle approximation and geometrical efficiency for a system with experimental arrangement using x-ray tube and secondary target. The variation of the solid angle is studied by changing the radius and length of the collimators towards and away from the source and sample. From these values the variation of the total solid angle and geometrical efficiency is deduced and the optimum value is used for the experimental work. The efficiency is larger because the x-ray fluorescent source acts as a converter.

40|$|In 1958, Rundo (1) {{suggested}} {{that changes in}} scintillation spectra might {{be used as a}} method of determining the depth of a point source in a human body. Over a number of years, experiments have been carried out in this laboratory to examine the shape of scintillation spectra from thick sources with particular application to the effects observed in the counting of humans in a whole body counter (â€œsteelroomâ€•). The present paper reports results particularly pertinent to the estimation of the depths of point sources of gamma radiation in a human body using only a single sodium iodide crystal. It is clear that the location of sources is more straightforward if scanning of the body in both horizontal and vertical planes is carried out. However, at the present time there are many laboratories where single detector whole body counters exist without scanning facilities (2). The most noticeable effects of the scattering of originally <b>monoenergetic</b> <b>radiation</b> on the shapes of the scintillation spectra observed are a widening of the photopeak, a filling of the gap between the photopeak and the Compton plateau, and a build-up of low energy pulses. Of these three, the second is the most val uable for characterizing the changes that occur (3, 4); the valley-to-peak ratio, V/P, defined as the number of counts in the lowest channel between the photo peak and the Compton plateau divided by the maximum count in the photopeak, is a useful parameter for describing this effect. This valley-to-peak ratio, and the change in apparent resolution are used in the present paper to measure changes in the shapes of spectra obtained from gamma ray sources of energies from 0. 28 to 1. 53 MeV when they are at different positions in a water phantom simulating the human body...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} use of {{high-power}} lasers for synchrotron radiation sources with high brilliance, from the EUV to the hard X-ray spectral range. Hereby lasers accelerate electrons by laser-wakefield acceleration (LWFA), act as optical undulators, or both. Experimental evidence shows {{for the first time}} that LWFA electron bunches are shorter than the driving laser and have a length scale comparable to the plasma wavelength. Furthermore, a first proof of principle experiment demonstrates that LWFA electrons can be exploited to generate undulator radiation. Building upon these experimental findings, as well as extensive numerical simulations of Thomson scattering, the theoretical foundations of a novel interaction geometry for laser-matter interaction are developed. This new method is very general and when tailored towards relativistically moving targets not being limited by the focusability (Rayleigh length) of the laser, while it does not require a waveguide. In a theoretical investigation of Thomson scattering, the optical analogue of undulator radiation, the limits of Thomson sources in scaling towards higher peak brilliances are highlighted. This leads to a novel method for generating brilliant, highly tunable X-ray sources, which is highly energy efficient by circumventing the laser Rayleigh limit through a novel traveling-wave Thomson scattering (TWTS) geometry. This new method suggests increases in X-ray photon yields of 2 - 3 orders of magnitudes using existing lasers and a way towards efficient, optical undulators to drive a free-electron laser. The results presented here extend far beyond the scope of this work. The possibility to use lasers as particle accelerators, as well as optical undulators, leads to very compact and energy efficient synchrotron sources. The resulting <b>monoenergetic</b> <b>radiation</b> of high brilliance in a range from extreme ultraviolet (EUV) to hard X-ray radiation is of fundamental importance for basic research, medical applications, material and life sciences and is going to significantly contribute to a new generation of radiation sources and free-electron lasers (FELs) ...|$|E
