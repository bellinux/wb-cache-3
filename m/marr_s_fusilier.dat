Bacteriol. 84 : 669 – 678. 1962. —Thin {{sections of the}} cells of Azotobacter agilis which have been disrupted by sonic treatment, by osmotic shock, or by ballistic disintegration reveal a network of internal membranes {{in the form of}} vesicles and tubules. The internal membranes are attached to the envelope. Treatment in a Mickle disintegrator of envelopes emptied of cytoplasm by osmotic shock results in the loss of the internal membranes and a concomitant release of reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide oxidase from the envelopes. Thus, the intracytoplasmic membranes are the probable locus of the respiratory enzymes of the cell. Thin sections of whole cells show tubular intracytoplasmic membranes which are obscured by ribosomes and other dense cytoplasmic constituents...|$|R
25|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in 1996, physician-epidemiologist John <b>S.</b> <b>Marr</b> and co-author Curt Malloy integrated biblical, historical and Egyptological sources with modern scientific conjectures in a comprehensive review of natural explanations for the ten plagues, postulating their own specific explanations for the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and tenth plagues. Their explanation also accounted for the apparent selectiveness of the plagues, as implied in the Bible. The paper served as the basis for a website and documentary aired on the Learning Channel from 1998 to 2005.|$|R

30|$|In recent years, {{machine vision}} has {{developed}} rapidly, and monitoring technology {{has become increasingly}} mature. Video surveillance technology {{has been used in}} many industries, and it has also been adopted in the safety monitoring of transport corridors [2]. In the late 1970 <b>s,</b> <b>Marr</b> first proposed a more complete visual system framework from the perspective of information processing and integrated image processing to form a new stereo vision computing theory. After entering the 1990 s, stereo vision has gradually developed into a new discipline of cross-integration in multiple fields. It has received great attention from academia and industry and has been widely used in industrial image detection, robot vision technology, medical image analysis, spatial remote sensing, military navigation technology and traffic management, and its application field is expanding [3]. In 1999, Lowe D. of Columbia University proposed the SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transformation) algorithm, which was summarized in 2004. The algorithm can be invariant to the image due to rotation, scale scaling and brightness changes, while maintaining a certain degree of stability due to visual angle changes, partial occlusion and image noise, which has been successfully applied to the image matching field [4].|$|R
