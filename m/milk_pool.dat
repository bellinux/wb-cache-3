Our previous studies in animal and cell models implicated the Zn transporter Zip 3 (Slc 39 a 3) in mammary gland Zn acquisition. Herein, we investigated this hypothesis directly by utilizing Zip 3 -null mice. Our data verify that Zip 3 is expressed in secretory mammary cells; however, Zip 3 does not {{play a major role}} in Zn import from the maternal circulation. Importantly, the primary localization of Zip 3 was associated with the luminal membrane of the secretory mammary cells. Consistent with this localization, Zn transfer studies using 65 Zn revealed that Zn retention in the secreted <b>milk</b> <b>pool</b> and milk Zn concentration was higher in Zip 3 -null compared with wild-type mice. Although total mammary gland Zn concentration was not altered, Zip 3 -null mice also had altered mammary tissue architecture, increased number of apoptotic cells, and reduced mammary gland weight implicating subtle changes in Zip 3 -mediated intracellular Zn pools in apoptosis regulation. Taken together, our data indicate that Zip 3 does not participate in the acquisition of Zn from maternal circulation for secretion into milk but, in contrast, primarily plays a role in the reuptake and cellular retention of Zn in the mammary gland from the previously secreted <b>milk</b> <b>pool,</b> thus regulating cellular function...|$|E
40|$|Ireland’s milk {{production}} sector relies on grass-based spring-calving systems, which facilitates cost advantages in {{milk production}} but entails {{a high degree}} of supply seasonality. Among other implications, this supply seasonality involves extra costs in the processing sector including elevated plant capacities and varying levels of resource utilisation throughout the year. If both the national raw milk production increased substantially (e. g. post-milk quota) and {{a high degree of}} seasonality persisted, extra processing capacities would be required to cope with peak supplies. Alternatively, existing capacities could be used more efficiently by distributing the milk volume more evenly during the year. In this analysis, an optimisation model was applied to analyse the costs and economies arising to an average Irish milk-processing business due to changes to the monthly distribution of milk deliveries and/or the total annual <b>milk</b> <b>pool.</b> Of the situations examined, changing from a seasonal supply prior to expansion to a smoother pattern combined with an increased <b>milk</b> <b>pool</b> emerged as the most beneficial option to the processor because both the processor’s gross surplus and the marginal producer milk price increased. In practice, it may however be the case that the extra costs arising to the producer from smoothing the milk intake distribution exceed the processor’s benefit. The interlinkages between the stages of the dairy supply chain mean that nationally, the seasonality trade-offs are complex and equivocal.

As a {{control for the}} effects of fostering, a similar group were fostered to immune mothers. Fostering, regardless of the immune state of the foster-mother, increased the susceptibility of the infant to upper respiratory tract infection. Increased susceptibility was associated with ablation of the infants IgM and IgA antibody responses and reduced secretion of transplacentally acquired IgG antibody in nasal secretions. In the reciprocal experiment, infants of non-immune mothers fostered to immune mothers cleared virus more rapidly than their peers who were fed by their own mothers. This protective effect was associated with an enhanced nasal IgM and IgA antibody response. Infants of immune mothers separated from their mothers at birth and hand-reared on a cow's-milk-based formula feed suffered an increased susceptibility to the virus similar to that seen in fostered infants.

Mean levels of alpha-HCH, gamma-HCH, dieldrin, cis-heptachlor-epoxide (0. 7 ng g - 1 fat), sum-chlordane (6. 1 ng g - 1 fat), trans-nonachlor (12. 0 ng g - 1 fat), BDE 47 (1. 9 ng g - 1 fat) and sum PBDE (3. 4 ng g - 1 fat) were comparable to the international median levels of the 15 other countries participating in the 2002 - 03 WHO exposure study. Hong Kong had the highest level of beta-HCH, possibly a residual effect of previous high exposures in the 1970 s. Body loads of beta-HCH and chlordane were lower among mothers with younger age while mothers born in mainland China had lower levels of beta-HCH, cis-heptachlor-epoxide, oxy-chlordane and trans-nonachlor. Levels of toxaphene, endrin, endosulfan, bromcyclene and nitrofen were not detected in all or almost all of the <b>milk</b> <b>pools.</b> Continuous monitoring of POPs in human milk, especially beta-HCH, is needed for surveillance and interpretation of time trends, and for linkage to strict enforcement of agricultural regulations. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
