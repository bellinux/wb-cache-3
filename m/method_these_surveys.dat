Sampling frames are not always available necessitating surveys using non-standard household sampling <b>methods.</b> <b>These</b> <b>surveys</b> are time-consuming, difficult to validate, and their implementation could be optimised. Here, we discuss {{an example of an}} optimisation procedure for rapid population estimation using T-Square sampling which has been used recently to estimate population sizes in emergencies. A two-stage process was proposed to optimise the T-Square method wherein the first stage optimises the sample size and the second stage optimises the pathway connecting the sampling points. The proposed procedure yields an optimal solution if the distribution of households is described by a spatially homogeneous Poisson process and can be sub-optimal otherwise. This research provides the first step in exploring how optimisation techniques could be applied to survey designs thereby providing more timely and accurate information for planning interventions...|$|R

A total of 41, 34 and 58 (including 24 faeces samples) from animals were sampled in 1996, 1997 and 2004. Krill was the overall dominant prey species (63 %) followed by polar cod (16 %) and other fish species (10 %) in terms of a combined index (frequency occurrence and weight). Resource mapping was performed in two areas simultaneous with the seal sampling, in 1996 and 1997 by using standard acoustic <b>methods.</b> <b>These</b> <b>surveys</b> suggested that krill was the most abundant prey in both areas and years; krill constituted 84 % and 69 % of the total prey biomass in 1996 (99. 7 tonnes/nm 2) and 1997 (21. 4 tonnes/nm 2), respectively followed by parathmisto sp.

The 57 surveys for which it was possible to calculate the percentage of PLGAs among all malignant minor salivary gland tumors (MMSGT) were included in this review. Results The statistical analyses show significant differences in the PLGA percentage by time period, country and continent in the studies included in this review. The percentage of PLGAs among MMSGTs varied among the studies, ranging from 0. 0 % to 46. 8 %. PLGA rates have varied over the period studied and have most recently increased. The frequency of reported PLGA cases also varied from 0. 0 % to 24. 8 % by the country in which the MMSGT studies were performed. The PLGA percentages also varied significantly by continent, with frequencies ranging from 3. 9 % in Asia to 20. 0 % in Oceania Conclusion Based on these results, we concluded that although the accuracy of PLGA diagnoses has improved, they remain a challenge for pathologists. To facilitate PLGA diagnoses, we have therefore made some suggestions for pathologists regarding tumors composed of single-layer strands of cells that form all of the histological patterns present in the tumor, consistency of the cytological appearance and uniformly positive CK 7, vimentin and S 100 immunohistochemistry, which indicate a single PLGA phenotype.

40|$|AbstractIncreasing public {{attention}} has been {{brought to bear on}} the solid waste management in Macau, due to the continually increasing generation amount and the limited space. In this study, we discussed residents’ attitudes and willingness to pay for solid waste recycling through a questionnaire survey. The results showed that Macau residents owned the relatively good environmental awareness. In regard to Macau environmental quality, most respondents (92. 4 %) expressed their satisfactions on current situation. About 50. 2 % respondents thought that the solid waste pollution in Macau was more serious than other three environmental pollutions. The survey data revealed a positive attitude towards source separation in Macau. Most of respondents (95. 7 %) were willing to sort the solid waste at home, if the government required them to do it. In addition, for the question how to improve the solid waste recycling in Macau, “enhancing residents’ environmental awareness”was considered as the most effective methods, accounting for about 38. 5 % respondents. In our study, most respondents (85. 4 %) also provided positive answers to the questions about WTP. Using the logistic regression <b>method,</b> <b>these</b> <b>survey</b> results support the hypothesis that the probability of the respondents’ saying ‘yes’ to the WTP question increases with education level. The monthly mean WTP was 38. 5 MOP per household and the annual WTP was approximately 79. 7 million MOP for all of Macau. The results can be useful for understanding the residents’ attitudes and WTP for solid waste disposal, for the policymakers and managers, and can be used to promote the recycling of solid waste in Macau...|$|R

A descriptive survey was completed by all teachers working in the school, who were classified into three category-groups: anxiety about using collaborative learning in teaching, effective ways of using the method, and how they put the <b>method</b> into practice. <b>These</b> data were obtained for a qualitative analysis. Also, a descriptive survey was taken by all students attending the school in grades 7 through 12. The question items included the definition of collaborative learning, its objective, situations in which it is effective, and teachers'anxiety about the <b>method.</b> From <b>these</b> <b>surveys,</b> we found that there were two types of anxiety faced by teachers: anxiety regarding the effectiveness of collaborative learning for the students and anxiety about using the collaborative learning model as their teaching method. The former includes concern about students'relationships in group-making and anxiety involving the limitations of the method of collaborative learning. The latter includes anxiety concerning the effects of collaborative learning, its assessment, and the practice itself. Opinions on the effectiveness of collaborative learning were divided between students and teachers. The former address acquiring one's perspective and attitudes toward learning, building relationships, emotional stability, and understanding methods of learning and ways of thinking.

S. JGOFS) program using the Lamont Pumping SeaSoar (LPS) are presented. They consist of three west-east transects from 170 °E to 180 ° longitude along the AESOPS study line at 76. 5 °S and three short north-south transects in the Ross Sea polynya during the initial and maturing stages of phytoplankton blooms in the austral {{spring and early summer}} of 1997. The LPS carried an in situ instrument array for measurement of temperature, salinity, fluorescence, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and dissolved oxygen. In addition, a high-pressure pump mounted aboard the LPS fish delivered a continuous seawater sample stream to the shipboard laboratory for high-speed analysis of its nutrient (nitrate plus nitrate, phosphate, and silicate) and total CO₂ concentrations and CO₂ partial pressure (Pco₂). Vertical resolution of this sampling equaled or exceeded that of hydrostation-style conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) casts; horizontal resolution (nominally equal to a vertical cast every 3 – 5 km) exceeded station resolution by a factor of 10. While not perfectly synoptic, the 20 -hour duration of these transects is far shorter than the time typically taken to complete the line with conventional sampling <b>methods.</b> <b>These</b> <b>surveys</b> clearly identified three distinct deep water masses below about 100 m: High-Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW) in the western end of the transects, Modified Circumpolar Deep Water (MCDW) {{in the middle of the}} transects, and Low-Salinity Shelf Water (LSSW) to the east. The regions to the west were characterized by high biological productivity with high N:P and C:P uptake ratios, but little Si uptake, indicating that the production was dominated by Phaeocystis. To the east, biological productivity was lower than in the west, and low N:P and C:P uptake ratios and high Si uptake indicated the dominance of diatoms. The difference in uptake ratios appears to be entirely due to anomalously high P uptake by diatoms; N:C uptake ratios are similar in the two regions and very near canonical Redfield stoichiometry. The area in the center of the transects was characterized by high stratification and low, diatom-dominated productivity; the reason for this low productivity is unclear but is speculated to be due to the short time which this water has been exposed to an ice-free surface. The presence of strong variability at horizontal length scales of order 10 km is evident in nearly all fields especially in upper 100 m, although many of the features are resolved only by two or three LPS tracks (each separated by only a few kilometers). Physical, bio-optical, and chemical variability is observed to extend vertically from sea surface to depths as deep as 140 m far below the 1...|$|R

The complex design features of these samples improve data collection efficiency, but also require analysts to account for these features when conducting analysis. Unfortunately, many secondary analysts from fields outside of statistics, biostatistics, and survey methodology do not have adequate training in this area, {{and as a result}} may apply incorrect statistical <b>methods</b> when analyzing <b>these</b> <b>survey</b> data sets. This in turn could lead to the publication of incorrect inferences based on the survey data that effectively negate the resources dedicated to <b>these</b> <b>surveys.</b> In this article, we build on the results of a preliminary meta-analysis of 100 peer-reviewed journal articles presenting {{analyses of}} data from a variety of national health surveys, which suggested that analytic errors may be extremely prevalent in these types of investigations. We first perform a meta-analysis of a stratified random sample of 145 additional research products analyzing survey data from the Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), which describes features of the U. S. Science and Engineering workforce, and examine trends in the prevalence of analytic error across the decades used to stratify the sample. We once again find that analytic errors appear to be quite prevalent in these studies. Next, we present several example analyses of real SESTAT data, and demonstrate that a failure to perform these analyses correctly can result in substantially biased estimates with standard errors that do not adequately reflect complex sample design features. Collectively, the results of this investigation suggest that reviewers of this type of research need to pay much closer attention to the analytic methods employed by researchers attempting to publish or present secondary analyses of survey data...|$|R

The vehicles were constructed to satisfy the requirements of the detector system and relay the necessary information back to the control station. The process, which is nearly fully autonomous, can map an area of interest and proceed to characterize the radiation materials that are found using neutron and gamma spectroscopy. The vehicles were tested in several scenarios which included obstacles, multiple sources, and shielding of the sources to determine the practicality of these co-robots. The evaluation of these co-robots was critical, as the future of radiation safety lies in the research and construction of small autonomous radiation detection systems to minimize the risk that radiation exposure poses to humans.
