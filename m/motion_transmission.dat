40|$|Tendon-based {{transmission}} {{is a common}} approach for transferring motion and forces in surgical robots. In spite of design simplicity and compactness {{that comes with the}} tendon drives, there exists a number of issues associated with the tendon-based transmission. In particular, the elasticity of the tendons and the frictional interaction between the tendon and the routing result in substantially nonlinear behavior. Also, in surgical applications, the distal joints of the robot and instruments cannot be sensorized in most cases due to technical limitations. Therefore, direct measurement of forces and use of feedback motion/force control for compensation of uncertainties in tendon-based motion and force transmission are not possible. However, force/motion estimation and control in tendon-based robots are important in view of the need for haptic feedback in robotic surgery and growing interest in automatizing common surgical tasks. One possible solution to the above-described problem is the development of mathematical models for tendon-based force and <b>motion</b> <b>transmission</b> {{that can be used for}} estimation and control purposes. This thesis provides analysis of force and <b>motion</b> <b>transmission</b> in tendon-pulley based surgical robots and addresses various aspects of the transmission modeling problem. Due to similarities between the quasi-static hysteretic behavior of a tendon-pulley based da Vinci® instrument and that of a typical tendon-sheath mechanism, a distributed friction approach for modeling the force transmission in the instrument is developed. The approach is extended to derive a formula for the apparent stiffness of the instrument. Consequently, a method is developed that uses the formula for apparent stiffness of the instrument to determine the stiffness distribution of the tissue palpated. The force transmission hysteresis is further investigated from a phenomenological point of view. It is shown that a classic Preisach hysteresis model can accurately describe the quasi-static input-output force transmission behavior of the da Vinci® instrument. Also, in order to describe the distributed friction effect in tendon-pulley mechanisms, the creep theory from belt mechanics is adopted for the robotic applications. As a result, a novel <b>motion</b> <b>transmission</b> model is suggested for tendon-pulley mechanisms. The developed model is of pseudo-kinematic type as it relates the output displacement to both the input displacement and the input force. The model is subsequently used for position control of the tip of the instrument. Furthermore, the proposed pseudo-kinematic model is extended to compensate for the coupled-hysteresis effect in a multi-DOF motion. A dynamic transmission model is also suggested that describes system’s response to high frequency inputs. Finally, the proposed <b>motion</b> <b>transmission</b> model was used for modeling of the backlash-like hysteresis in RAVEN II surgical robot...|$|E

In PET transmission measurement using external rotating radioactive sources, object <b>motion</b> during the <b>transmission</b> scan can affect measured attenuation correction factors (ACFs), causing incorrect radio tracer distribution or artefacts in reconstructed PET images.

40|$|Today, cheap {{technology}} and the exponential success of computer-controlled kinetic devices in architecture open up {{a wide range of}} new possibilities, increasing however the systems' dependence on energy, failing to exploit the true potential of ephemeralization. Simple devices can be designed to give autonomic kinetic response with zero energy input by integrating materials reacting to latent energy changes in the environment. Yet, the key to auto-reaction lies in the optimization of the system's design: the device must be fit enough to achieve the greatest movement with a minimal effort. This can be obtained by individuating the best combinations of geometrical factors, motion type, actuation and transmission through the biomimetic study of mobile patterns in nature, where many of these problems have found a solution through millions of years of evolutionary trial. The paper analyses three different complementary aspects describing motion, which have {{in the context of the}} biological systems evolved together.

When performing transmission measurements using an external rotating radioactive source, object <b>motion</b> during the <b>transmission</b> scan can distort the attenuation correction factors computed as {{the ratio of the}} blank to transmission counts, and cause errors and artefacts in reconstructed PET images. In this paper we report a compensation method for rigid body <b>motion</b> during PET <b>transmission</b> measurements, in which list mode <b>transmission</b> data are <b>motion</b> corrected event-by-event, based on known motion, to ensure that all events which traverse the same path through the object are recorded on a common line of response (LOR).

To ensure that the corresponding blank LOR records events from the same combination of contributing LORs, the list mode blank data are spatially transformed event-by-event based on the same motion information. The number of counts recorded on the resulting blank LOR is then equivalent to the number of counts that would have been recorded on the corresponding motion-corrected transmission LOR {{in the absence of any}} attenuating object.
