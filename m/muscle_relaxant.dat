5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are well}} known for their strong muscle-relaxing {{properties}} and {{can be useful in}} the treatment of muscle spasms, although tolerance often develops to their <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxant</b> effects. Baclofen or tizanidine are sometimes used as an alternative to benzodiazepines. Tizanidine has been found to have superior tolerability compared to diazepam and baclofen.|$|E
5|$|It {{would be}} nearly 200 {{years before the}} active principles, quinine and other alkaloids, of cinchona bark were isolated. Quinine, a toxic plant alkaloid, is, in {{addition}} to its anti-malarial properties, an effective <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxant,</b> as the modern use for nocturnal leg cramps suggests (corroborating its use for shivering by the Peruvian Indians).|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam, {{available}} {{under the}} trade name Xanax, is a potent, short-acting benzodiazepine anxiolytic—a minor tranquilizer. It {{is commonly used}} {{for the treatment of}} anxiety disorders, especially of panic disorder, but also in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or social anxiety disorder. It was the 12th most prescribed medicine in the United States in 2010. Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA receptor. It possesses anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxant,</b> anticonvulsant, amnestic, and antidepressant properties. Alprazolam is available for oral administration as compressed tablets (CT) and extended-release capsules (XR).|$|E
40|$|My {{objective}} is to analyze the efficiency of remifent-anil-propofol and alfentanil-propofol combinations for laryngoscopic endotracheal intubation {{in the absence of}} <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxants.</b> This analysis reviews the work by Imani et al. (1). <b>Muscle</b> <b>relaxants</b> are frequently used to facilitate endotracheal intubation during anesthesia induction. However, the administration of short-acting depolarizing <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxants</b> is closely related to post-operative myalgias, malignant hyperthermia, hyperkale-mia, and increased intracranial or intraocular pressure. Using non-depolarizing <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxants</b> may produce prolonged neuromuscular blockade, potentiate hista-mine release, increase the side effects from anticholines-terases used for reversing the agents, and lead to an in-ability to quickly reverse the blockade in the event of a...|$|R

5|$|Because {{of their}} <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxant</b> action, benzodiazepines may cause {{respiratory}} depression in susceptible individuals. For that reason, they are contraindicated {{in people with}} myasthenia gravis, sleep apnea, bronchitis, and COPD. Caution is required when benzodiazepines are used in people with personality disorders or intellectual disability because of frequent paradoxical reactions. In major depression, they may precipitate suicidal tendencies and are sometimes used for suicidal overdoses. Individuals {{with a history of}} alcohol, opioid and barbiturate abuse should avoid benzodiazepines, as there is a risk of life-threatening interactions with these drugs.|$|E
5|$|On August 13, 2007, Adams {{was found}} {{unconscious}} {{in his bed}} by his youngest son (age 7) at their Tampa, Florida home. His son called 911, but Adams was pronounced dead by paramedics when they arrived. The medical examiner concluded that he {{died as a result}} of mixing the painkiller buprenorphine with the <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxant</b> carisoprodol and the sedatives chlordiazepoxide and alprazolam. The coroner determined the drugs in his system were individually at therapeutic levels, but their combination impeded his respiratory system enough to kill him. He was 43 years old.|$|E
5|$|The {{benzodiazepine}} {{class of}} drugs also interact with peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors {{are present in}} peripheral nervous system tissues, glial cells, {{and to a lesser}} extent the central nervous system. These peripheral receptors are not structurally related or coupled to GABAA receptors. They modulate the immune system and are involved in the body response to injury. Benzodiazepines also function as weak adenosine reuptake inhibitors. It has been suggested that some of their anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxant</b> effects may be in part mediated by this action.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines possess sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxant,</b> and amnesic actions, {{which are}} useful {{in a variety of}} {{indications}} such as alcohol dependence, seizures, anxiety disorders, panic, agitation, and insomnia. Most are administered orally; however, they can also be given intravenously, intramuscularly, or rectally. In general, benzodiazepines are well-tolerated and are safe and effective drugs in the short term {{for a wide range of}} conditions. Tolerance can develop to their effects and there is also a risk of dependence, and upon discontinuation a withdrawal syndrome may occur. These factors, combined with other possible secondary effects after prolonged use such as psychomotor, cognitive, or memory impairments, limit their long-term applicability. The effects of long-term use or misuse include the tendency to cause or worsen cognitive deficits, depression, and anxiety. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia recommends discontinuing the usage of benzodiazepines in those on opioids and those who have used them long term.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam is classed as a high-potency triazolo{{benzodiazepine}}: a benzodiazepine with a triazole ring {{attached to}} its structure. As a benzodiazepine, alprazolam produces {{a variety of}} therapeutic and adverse effects by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor site on the GABAA receptor and modulating its function; GABA receptors are the most prolific inhibitory receptor within the brain. The GABA chemical and receptor system mediates inhibitory or calming effects of alprazolam on the nervous system. The GABAA receptor {{is made up of}} 5 subunits out of a possible 19, and GABAA receptors made up of different combinations of subunits have different properties, different locations within the brain, and, importantly, different activities with regard to benzodiazepines. Alprazolam and other triazolobenzodiazepines like triazolam that have a triazol ring attached to their structure appear to have antidepressant properties, since the structure resembles that of tricyclic antidepressants, which also have rings. Alprazolam causes a marked suppression of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis. The therapeutic properties of alprazolam are similar to other benzodiazepines and include anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxant,</b> hypnotic and amnesic; however, it is used mainly as an anxiolytic.|$|E
5|$|Being a brachycephalic breed, King Charles Spaniels can be {{sensitive}} to anesthesia. This is because in brachycephalic dogs, there is additional tissue in the throat directly behind the mouth and nasal cavity, known as the pharynx, and anesthesia acts as a <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxant</b> causing this tissue to obstruct the dogs' narrow airways. These narrow airways can decrease the dogs' ability to exercise properly and increase their susceptibility to heat stroke. Other congenital and hereditary disorders found in the King Charles Spaniel are hanging tongue, where a neurological defect prevents the tongue from retracting into the mouth; diabetes mellitus, which {{may be associated with}} cataracts; cleft palate and umbilical hernia. The English Toy Spaniel Club of America recommends that umbilical hernias be corrected only if other surgery is required, due to the risk of surgery in brachycephalic breeds. In another study conducted by the OFA, the King Charles Spaniel was the 38th worst of 99 breeds for patella luxation; of 75 animals tested, 4% were found to have the ailment. However, surveys conducted by the Finnish breed club between 1988 and 2007 found that the occurrences were higher in some years, ranging from 5.3% to 50%.|$|E

40|$|Background: Non-opioid psychotherapeutic {{medications}} {{significantly increase}} the risk of opioid overdose-related deaths. We prospectively followed HIV-infected indigent adults sampled from the community to examine rates of and factors associated with non-medical use of benzodiazepines, <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxants,</b> and prescription stimulants. Methods: We interviewed participants quarterly for 2 years about alcohol and illicit substance use; depression; use of prescribed opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines and muscle relaxants; opioid analgesic misuse; and non-medical use (i. e., use without a prescription) of benzodiazepines, <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxants,</b> and prescription stimulants. Using mixed-effects multivariate logistic regression, we determined factors associated with non-medical use of benzodiazepines, <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxants,</b> and prescription stimulants. Results: Among the 296 participants at enrollment, 52. 0 % reported taking opioid analgesics that had been prescribed, 17. 9 % took benzodiazepines that had been prescribed, and 8. 1 % took <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxants</b> that had been prescribed. Over the 2 -year study interval, 53. 4 % reported prescription opioid misuse, 25. 3 % reported non-medical use of benzodiazepines, 11. 5 % reported non-medical use of <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxants,</b> and 6. 1 % reported non-medical use of prescription stimulants. In multivariable analysis, opioid analgesic misuse in the past 90 days was associated with non-medical use of benzodiazepines, <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxants,</b> and prescription stimulants during the same time interval. Illicit substance use and depression were not associated with non-medical use of these medications. Conclusions: Prescription opioid analgesic misuse is associated with non-medical use of other psychotherapeutic medications. Health care providers should monitor for non-medical use of a broad array of psychoactive medications among high-risk populations to minimize harm. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd...|$|R
