There has been, however, no substantiated record of the species outside the Mediterranean. This fact and the easiness of confusion of R. asterias with other species have probably prevented those records from being {{taken into account in}} the recent catalogue of North Atlantic elasmobranchs species, in the assessment of the population status of this species, and in recent annotated global checklists of chondrichthyans. In our study, a specimen of R. asterias was collected from the Gulf of Cádiz and its species identity was assessed based on morphological and molecular methods. The presently reported finding constitutes a substantiated record of R. asterias from the Atlantic. Based on this record, previously reported catches of the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>starry</b> <b>ray</b> in the Atlantic should be confirmed, and if so, these populations should be included in future assessments of this vulnerable species and in the description of its geographic distributionVersión del editor 0, 54...|$|E

This information is also valuable from a more general management perspective, as marine predators are often considered indicators of habitat quality. In this context, we aimed to determine the degree to which environmental features, prey availability and human activities interact and influence spatial distribution of two marine mesopredator elasmobranchs, the small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) and the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>starry</b> <b>ray</b> (Raja asterias), living in a highly human-exploited environment. LocationMediterranean Sea. MethodsWith information obtained from an extended experimental survey, we investigated the relative importance of environmental variables, prey availability and human activities on the spatial distribution of the abundance, biomass and occurrence rate of these marine mesopredators using deviance partitioning analyses. ResultsOur results revealed that environmental variables were the most important factors explaining the spatial distribution of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>starry</b> <b>ray,</b> whereas small-spotted catshark distribution was also influenced by prey availability and human factors. From a management point of view, these findings suggest that <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>starry</b> <b>ray</b> could be a good candidate as an indicator species of demersal environmental quality. On the other hand, the distribution of the small-spotted catshark, which responds in an interactive and complex way to environment, prey availability and particular human activities, may be misleading as an environmental indicator. Main conclusionsThe spatial distribution of elasmobranchs in highly human-impacted marine areas can reflect the interactive and combined effects of multiple factors.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{deal with the}} {{population}} structure and connectivity of the <b>Mediterranean</b> endemic <b>starry</b> <b>ray</b> Raja asterias (Delaroche, 1809) in the Western and Eastern Mediterranean basin. A panel of eight microsatellite loci which cross-amplify in Rajidae (El Nagar, 2010) {{was used to assess}} population connectivity and structure. Those aims were investigated by analyzing the genetic variation of 9 population sample for a total of 185 individuals collected during past scientific surveys (MEDITS, GRUND), commercial trawling and also directly at fish markets. The purpose of this thesis is to estimate the genetic divergence occurring between the Mediterranean populations and, in particular, to assess the presence of any barrier (geographic, hydrogeological and biological) to gene flow for this species. Different statistical approaches were performed to reach this aim evaluating both the genetic diversity (nucleotide diversity, allelic richness, observed and expected heterozygosity and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test) and the population differentiation patterns (pairwise Fst estimated and population structure analysis). The results obtained from the analysis of the microsatellite dataset suggest a geographic and genetic separation between the <b>starry</b> <b>ray</b> populations of the Mediterranean basin into three or four distinct groups: Western and Eastern Mediterranean basins and Sicilian coast always clustering as an independent group and Algeria which could be or not considered another separate group. The data were discussed from both an evolutionary and a conservation point of view and in relation to previous results obtained by the analysis of mitochondrial marker. A comparison with other Mediterranean demersal skate species was performed in order to better contextualise our results. Finally, our results could offer useful information to protect vulnerable species as R. asterias and developing effective conservation plans in the Mediterranean...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTotal mercury {{concentrations}} were determined in different fish {{size classes of}} commercial importance such as, conger eel (Conger conger), <b>starry</b> <b>ray</b> (Raja asterias), forkbeard (Phycis blennoides), frostfish (Lepidopus caudatus), striped mullet (Mullus barbatus), red gurnard (Aspitrigla cuculus) and yellow gurnard (Trigla lucerna) in order to evaluate eventual variations in consumer exposure to mercury {{as a function of}} fish consumption of different size spectra. The highest mean levels of total mercury were detected in conger eel (0. 80 μg g- 1) and in <b>starry</b> <b>ray</b> (0. 75 μg g- 1). Forkbeard (0. 67 μ g g- 1), frostfish (0. 59 gμ g- 1) and striped mullet (0. 55 μg g- 1) showed slightly lower levels, while red gurnard (0. 33 μg g- 1) and yellow gurnard (0. 22 μg g- 1) exhibited the lowest concentrations. The results of the linear regression analysis showed significant relationship between mercury concentrations and fish size for all species. Consequently, dietary consumption of larger size specimens leaded to an increase in the exposure level for consumer. Understanding by consumers of all factors leading to an increase of exposure to mercury is the first step to address them to make decisions about eating fish...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{work has}} shown that the cardiac outflow tract of sharks and chimaeras does not consist of a single {{myocardial}} component, the conus arteriosus, as classically accepted, but two, namely, the myocardial conus arteriosus and the non-myocardial bulbus arteriosus. However, the anatomical composition of the outflow tract of the batoid hearts remains unknown. The present study was designed to fill this gap. The material examined consisted of hearts of two species of rays, namely, the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>starry</b> <b>ray</b> (Raja asterias) and sandy ray (Leucoraja circularis). They were studied using scanning electron microscopy, and histochemical and inmunohistochemical techniques. In both species, the outflow tract consists of two components, proximal and distal with regard to the ventricle. The proximal component is the conus arteriosus; it is characterized by the presence of compact myocardium in its wall and several transverse rows of pocket-shaped valves at its luminal side. Each valve consists of a leaflet and its supporting sinus. Histologically, the leaflet has two fibrosas, inner and outer, and a middle coat, the spongiosa. The distal component lacks myocardium. Its wall consists of smooth muscle cells, elastic fibers and collagen. Thus, it shows an arterial-like structure. However, it differs from the aorta because it is covered by the epicardium and crossed by coronary arteries. These findings indicate that the distal component is morphologically equivalent to the bulbus arteriosus of sharks and chimaeras. In contrast to foregoing descriptions, the valves of the first transverse row are distally anchored to the bulbus arteriosus and not to the ventral aorta. Our findings give added support to the notion that presence of a bulbus arteriosus at the arterial pole of the heart is common to all chondrichtyans, and not an apomorphy of actinopterygians as classically thought.

40|$|Abstract How have North Sea skate and shark assemblages {{changed since}} the early 20 th century when bottom {{trawling}} became widespread, whilst their environment became increasingly impacted by fishing, climate change, habitat degradation and other anthropogenic pressures? This article examines long-term changes in the distribution and occurrence of the elasmobranch assemblage of the southern North Sea, based on extensive historical time series (1902 – 2013) of fishery-independent survey data. In general, larger species (thornback ray, tope, spurdog) exhibited long-term declines, and the largest (common skate complex) became locally extirpated (as did angelshark). Smaller species increased (spotted and <b>starry</b> <b>ray,</b> lesser-spotted dogfish) as did smooth-hound, likely benefiting from greater resilience to fishing and/or climate change. This indicates a fundamental shift from historical dominance of larger, commercially valuable species to current prevalence of smaller, more productive species often of low commercial value. In recent years, however, some trends have reversed, with the (cold-water associated) <b>starry</b> <b>ray</b> now declining and thornback ray increasing. This shift {{may be attributed to}} (i) fishing, including mechanised beam trawling introduced in the 1960 s– 1970 s, and historical target fisheries for elasmobranchs; (ii) climate change, currently favouring warm-water above cold-water species; and (iii) habitat loss, including potential degradation of coastal and outer estuarine nursery habitats. The same anthropogenic pressures, here documented to have impacted North Sea elasmobranchs over the past century, are likewise impacting shelf seas worldwide and may increase in the future; therefore, parallel changes in elasmobranch communities in other regions are to be expected...|$|R

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of skates (Rajidae) in the by-catch of trawl and long-line fisheries in the Barents Sea are described. The dominant species captured were thorny skate or <b>starry</b> <b>ray</b> (Amblyraja radi-ate), arctic skate (A. hyperborea) and round skate (Rajella fyllae), whereas blue or big skate (Dipturus batis) and sail ray (D. linteus) were only caught occasionally. Information {{on the size}} distribution and sex ratio are provided. Larger skates were more often caught in long-line fisheries, with the mean and maximum length of fish greater in long-line catches, particularly for the larger-bodied species. Ratio of males to females was close to 1 : 1 in all species except for arctic skate where males dominated in the long-line fishery. Preliminary estimates of skate by-catch in these fisheries indicate that total annual by-catch of skate in the Barents Sea ranges from 723 – 1 891 tons. Thorny skate accounted for 90 – 95 % of the total skate catch...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the current levels of total mercury and methylmercury in the muscle tissues of different fish species caught in the Mediterranean Sea to ascertain whether these concentrations exceed the maximum level stipulated by the European Commission Decision. Total mercury concentrations in the muscles of skates ranged from 0. 18 to 1. 85 mg/kg (wet weight) (average, 1. 00 mg/kg) while levels of 0. 11 to 1. 92 mg/kg (wet weight) (average, 0. 70 mg/kg) and 0. 21 to 1. 74 mg/kg (wet weight) (average, 0. 70 mg/kg) were recorded for blue whiting and red mullet, respectively. For 66. 7 % of long nose skate samples, 61. 4 % of thornback ray samples, 42. 8 % of winter skate samples, and 38 % of <b>starry</b> <b>ray</b> samples, the total mercury concentrations exceeded the prescribed legal limit (1. 0 mg/kg [wet weight]). Concentrations exceeding the maximum total mercury level stipulated by the European Commission Decision (0. 5 mg/kg [wet weight]) were observed in 63. 6 and 40 % of blue whiting and striped mullet samples, respectively. Mercury was present in the different species almost completely in the methylated form at 55 to 100 %.

40|$|Population {{structure}} {{and distribution of}} the <b>starry</b> <b>ray,</b> Raja asterias, were described based on data collected during yearly rapido trawl surveys (SoleMon), between 2005 and 2014 in the Northern and Central Adriatic Sea. A total of 306 individuals were caught, sex ratio was 1. 04 : 1 in favor of males and length-weight relationships were obtained for the whole sample. Following the MEDITS scale, maturity was estimated, observing a higher number of immature individuals. Relative abundance significantly increased during the recent period with the highest values recorded at 5 - 30 m depths. Such increase {{could be related to}} the response of R. asterias to climatic change or to the decrease  in fishing pressure in the area. Clear spatial segregation of individuals depending on their life stage was observed, with immature individuals inhabiting the coastal areas and adults more abundant at depths greater than 40 m. The comparison of the result of the present study with MEDITS survey outcomes in terms of  distribution patterns, persistence areas of adults and juveniles and abundances indices, evidences that SoleMon survey seems to be more suitable in defining such features of the stock, likely due to the greater catchability of the rapido trawl in respect to the MEDITS trawl net. However, further investigations are needed to identify factors affecting the increasing abundance of this species, and develop an action plan for spatial management of fishing activities...|$|R
