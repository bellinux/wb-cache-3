40|$|AbstractFlash floods, erratically {{striking}} semi-arid regions, often cause field {{flooding and}} soil anoxia, resulting in crop losses on food staples, typically pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench). Recent glasshouse {{studies have indicated}} that rice (Oryza spp.) can enhance flood stress tolerance of co-growing dryland cereals by modifying their rhizosphere microenvironments via the oxygen released from its roots into the aqueous rhizosphere. We tested whether this phenomenon would be expressed under field flood conditions. The effects of <b>mix-planting</b> of pearl millet and sorghum with rice on their survival, growth and grain yields were evaluated under controlled field flooding in semi-arid Namibia during 2014 / 2015 – 2015 / 2016. Single-stand and mixed plant treatments were subjected to 11 – 22 day flood stress at the vegetative growth stage. Mixed planting increased plant survival rates in both pearl millet and sorghum. Grain yields of pearl millet and sorghum were reduced by flooding, in both the single-stand and mixed plant treatments, relative to the non-flooded upland yields, but the reduction was lower in the mixed plant treatments. In contrast, flooding increased rice yields. Both pearl millet–rice and sorghum–rice mixtures demonstrated higher land equivalent ratios, indicating a mixed planting advantage under flood conditions. These results indicate that <b>mix-planting</b> pearl millet and sorghum with rice could alleviate flood stress on dryland cereals. The results also suggest that with this cropping technique, rice could compensate for the dryland cereal yield losses due to field flooding...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Wheat straws, wheat shells, corn {{leaves and}} corn cobs (0 %, 5 %, 8 % and 10 %) {{were added to}} red clay to obtain {{seedling}} bricks, pure red clay as control (CK), did evaporation test. The {{results showed that the}} larger of the proportion of <b>mix-plant</b> was, the smaller the cumulative evaporation of seedling bricks was. The cumulative evaporation of seedling bricks mixed with 10 % corn cob was the minimum. In all seedling bricks, the order of 1 st day evaporation suppression efficiency and cumulative evaporation suppression efficiency IE: mixed with corn cobs> mixed with wheat shells> mixed with wheat straws> mixed with corn leaves> mixed with nothing, and evaporation suppression efficiency of seedling bricks mixed with 10 % corn cobs was the maximum. With the proportion of <b>mix-plant</b> increases, evaporation stability, evaporation suppression efficiency and water retention characteristic of seedling bricks were improved significantly...|$|R
40|$|AbstractVegetation cover {{change has}} a {{profound}} {{influence on the}} hydrological cycle. A reduction in vegetative cover from forest harvesting generally increases the average surface runoff volume and total water yield for a given area of land. The differences of structure and land cover type are the main baseline in this research to understand the hydrological response of catchment. This research is using two catchment experiments, pine forest and <b>mix-plant</b> forest catchments. Plantation forest with clear cutting system in the mountain area is very sensitive with the changes of runoff and soil erosion. This study investigated the impact of vegetation changes on rainfall-runoff response in different type and periods of Pine forest plantation from their respective forestry treatments. The result shown that in the 7 -year old <b>mix-plant</b> forest, direct runoff, peak discharge and runoff coefficient are dramatically increased than that in the 37 -year old pine forest. 15 years after planting, direct runoff, peak discharge and runoff coefficient are decreased and reaching to the 37 -year old pine forest responses. Implementation of a <b>mix-plant</b> forest method is effective in controlling the hydrological responses of direct runoff, peak discharge and runoff coefficient. The {{results showed that the}} magnitude of runoff during different forest treatments depend on interactions among rainfall, forest cover changes and surface disturbance. Forest management practices should consider and attempt to minimize disturbance during each plantation stage to control runoff response...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory and {{greenhouse}} {{experiments were}} conducted to determine the allelopathic activity of sunflower (Helianthus annuus) on seed germination, seedling growth, flowering and nodulation of bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea L. Verdc.). Bambara groundnut seeds were treated with diluted and undiluted sunflower extracts under laboratory conditions. Sunflower was also mixed-planted with bambara groundnut in the greenhouse. The effect of sunflower plant residues on bambara groundnut was also determined. Sunflower leaf and root extracts reduced seed germination, seedling growth and reduced seedling dry weight of bambara groundnut under laboratory conditions. Root length was reduced more than the shoot length. Diluted extracts also inhibited seed germination and seedling growth in a concentration-dependent manner. There {{was no significant difference}} in the shoot length, number of leaves, nodules and flowers of bambara groundnut which was <b>mix-planted</b> with sunflower compared to bambara groundnuts grown on their own under greenhouse conditions; except for dry weight which was reduced. However, there was an increase in dry weight of sunflower that was <b>mix-planted</b> with bambara groundnut compared to sunflower grown on their own. Flowering and nodulation was completely inhibited in bambara groundnuts grown in soils mixed with sunflower plant residues at 75 : 25 and 50 : 50 (w/w) soil:residue mixture. Seed germination, shoot elongation and leaf formation was also reduced. Similar results were also obtained when the amended soil was re-used to grow bambara groundnut. The results of this study suggest that sunflower contains allelochemicals that have strong inhibitory effect on growth, especially flowering and nodulation, of bambara groundnuts. The results indicate the implications of cropping systems between sunflower and bambara groundnuts...|$|R
