5|$|The players {{acquired}} by Fletcher matured {{into one of}} the strongest teams in the league during the mid-1980s and early 1990s. From 1984–85 to 1990–91, the Flames tallied 90 points in every season but one. However, they were usually unable to transform that success into a deep playoff run, largely because they could not get the better of their provincial rivals, the powerhouse Oilers. Although the Oilers and Flames usually finished at or {{near the top of the}} Campbell Conference, the NHL's playoff structure of the time <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> likely that the Flames would meet the Oilers in either the first or second round, rather than in Campbell Conference finals. That same structure <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> likely that the other two playoff qualifiers in the Smythe Division would have to get past the Flames or Oilers (or both) in order to make it to the conference finals. From 1983 until 1990, either the Oilers or the Flames represented the Campbell Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the recent}} past, little {{attention}} {{was paid to}} the interests of Third World countries. This is because most international relations scholars have come from the industrialized, First World nations. As more countries have continued to become more developed, the interests of the world have slowly started to shift. However, First World nations still have many more universities, professors, journals, and conferences, which has <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult for Third World countries to gain legitimacy and respect with their new ideas and methods of looking at the world.|$|E

5|$|The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism was Weber's {{third major}} {{work on the}} {{sociology}} of religion. In this work he deals with the structure of Indian society, with the orthodox doctrines of Hinduism and the heterodox doctrines of Buddhism, with modifications brought by the influence of popular religiosity and finally {{with the impact of}} religious beliefs on the secular ethic of Indian society. In Weber's view, Hinduism in India, like Confucianism in China, was a barrier for capitalism. The Indian caste system <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult for individuals to advance in the society beyond their caste. Activity, including economic activity, was seen as unimportant {{in the context of the}} advancement of the soul.|$|E
5|$|We <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> {{clear we}} were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like {{they really wanted to}} know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E
5|$|While at Celtic, Hooper {{struck up}} an {{excellent}} partnership with fellow striker Anthony Stokes. They scored over 40 goals {{between them in}} their first season together and {{were considered to be}} Celtic's best strike partnership, although on many occasions, especially for big matches, Georgios Samaras was often used alongside Hooper. Hooper expressed his disappointment at this because he felt that he worked very well with Stokes. In their partnership Hooper usually had a more advanced role, playing off the shoulder of the last defender, or in the box, and making runs in behind. His strength, pace, finishing ability and awareness made him suitably adapted to this role. Stokes usually played a deeper role, coming short to get the ball and creating space through his dribbling skill and passing. Although Hooper is more suited to an advanced role, and Stokes to a deeper one, they were capable of switching and both have the skills required to play in either role. This <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> hard for defenders to mark them.|$|E

25|$|Until after World War II, the {{landlocked}} British {{possession of}} Southern Rhodesia was not developed as an indigenous African territory, {{but rather as}} a unique state which reflected its multiracial character. This situation <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> different from other lands which existed under colonial rule, as many Europeans had arrived to make permanent homes, populating the towns as traders or settling to farm the most productive soils.|$|E
25|$|In {{the decade}} that followed, the union fought off employers' efforts {{to impose the}} open shop, which would have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> {{difficult}} for the union to maintain the standards and membership it had won. While the open shop drive may have stalled the Carpenters' growth during the decade, it did not cause the severe membership losses and wage cuts that other unions suffered.|$|E

25|$|Another {{factor for}} the Jews to emigrate to Poland were the Magdeburg rights, or Magdeburg Law, a charter given to the Jews, among others, that {{specifically}} outlined the rights and privileges that Jews had coming into Poland. For example, they could define their neighborhoods and economic competitors and set up monopolies. This <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> attractive for Jewish communities {{to pick up and}} move to Poland.|$|E
25|$|Compressibility is an {{important}} factor in aerodynamics. At low speeds, the compressibility of air is not significant in relation to aircraft design, but as the airflow nears and exceeds the speed of sound, a host of new aerodynamic effects become important in the design of aircraft. These effects, often several of them at a time, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult for World War II era aircraft to reach speeds much beyond 800km/h (500mph).|$|E
25|$|After Daisies the {{government}} <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult for Chytilová {{to find work}} within Czechoslovakia, {{even though she was}} never officially classified as a 'blacklisted' director. Her follow-up film Ovoce stromů rajských jíme (Fruit of Paradise, 1969) was her last film before the Soviet Union invasion of 1968. After the Soviet Union invasion it was virtually impossible for Chytilová to find work and she resorted to directing commercials under her husband’s name, Jaroslav Kučera.|$|E

The Boston and Lowell ordered another locomotive and cars for local passenger rail in 1842, and had them make six stops along the route. Passenger rail proved to be almost as profitable as freight.|$|E
25|$|Giardia {{had been}} {{assumed to be}} primitively asexual and with no means of {{transferring}} DNA between nuclei. These assumptions <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult to explain the remarkably low level of allelic heterozygosity (< 0.01%) in the genome isolate, WB. However, all those assumptions of asexuality are now in doubt, with population genetics providing evidence for recombination and the identification of meiotic genes, evidence for recombination among isolates and the evidence for exchange of genetic material between nuclei {{during the process of}} encystation.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1767 at age 21, Jefferson {{inherited}} 5,000 {{acres of}} land and 52 slaves by his father's will. In 1768, Jefferson began construction of his Monticello plantation. Through his marriage to Martha Wayles in 1772 and inheritance from his father-in-law John Wayles, in 1773 Jefferson inherited two plantations and 135 slaves. By 1776, Jefferson {{was one of the}} largest planters in Virginia. However, the value of his property (land and slaves) was increasingly offset by his growing debts, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult to free his slaves and thereby lose them as assets.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year {{the village of}} Menands was incorporated {{in the area around}} the plant, giving the company the address it would be known by for decades afterwards.

25|$|In any case, the {{translation}} of the astronomical records required profound knowledge of the cuneiform script, the language, and the procedures, so {{it seems likely that}} it was done by some unidentified Chaldeans. Now, the Babylonians dated their observations in their lunisolar calendar, in which months and years have varying lengths (29 or 30 days; 12 or 13 months respectively). At the time they did not use a regular calendar (such as based on the Metonic cycle like they did later), but started a new month based on observations of the New Moon. This <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> tedious to compute the time interval between events.|$|E
25|$|Consumed in bitter wars {{with the}} Persian Sasanian Empire in the east, the Byzantines had little {{resources}} {{to confront the}} Slavs. The Slavs came in large numbers {{and the lack of}} political organisation <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult to stop them because there was no political leader to defeat in battle and thereby force their retreat. As the wars with Persia persisted, the 610s and 620s saw a new and even larger migration wave with the Slavs penetrating further south into the Balkans, reaching Thessaly, Thrace and Peloponnese and raiding some islands in the Aegean Sea. The Byzantines held out Salonica and a number of coastal towns but beyond these areas the imperial authority in the Balkans disappeared.|$|E
