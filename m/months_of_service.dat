5|$|A {{friend of}} Eberhardt's {{gave her a}} letter of {{introduction}} to playwright Eugène Brieux, who opposed French rule in North Africa and supported Arab emancipation. He sent her a several-hundred-franc advance and tried to have her stories published, but could not find anyone willing to publish pro-Arab writing. Eberhardt, unfazed, continued writing; her morale lifted when Ehnni was transferred to a spahi regiment near Marseille in late August to complete his final <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> He did not require permission from his military superiors to marry in France, and he and Eberhardt were married in October 1901. Shortly before they were married, Eberhardt and Augustin received the news that Trophimowsky's estate had finally been sold, though due to the mounting legal costs {{there was no money}} left for them to inherit. With this news, Eberhardt abandoned any hope of having a financially secure future. In February 1902 Ehnni was discharged, and the couple returned to Bône to live with his family.|$|E
5|$|A {{key feature}} of the Cadet Nurse Corps program was its {{accelerated}} training curricula. Participating schools of nursing were required to compress the traditional nursing program of 36 months to 30 months. They were also bound to provide the students with the four clinical experiences of medical, surgical, obstetrics, and pediatrics. The students became senior cadets {{in the last six}} months before graduation, requiring them to serve in a federal or civilian hospital. They rendered full-time service equivalent to that of a graduate nurse. During their first nine <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> the cadets were protected by regulation from working on the wards for more than 24 hours each week. Junior cadets typically worked between 40 and 48 hours each week, including classes. Senior cadets were free of classes. All State Boards of Nursing modified their regulations to agree with the accelerated program.|$|E
