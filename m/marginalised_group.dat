50|$|This {{group of}} undocumented {{immigrants}} is acutely under-represented in labour unions, {{civil society and}} community activism efforts, and not represented at all politically. This lack of representation leaves them with compromised access to education, health care, labour rights, shelter, {{and even the most}} basic human rights. They are among the most easily and widely exploited individuals in South Africa, and are often made the victims of targeted hate crimes and xenophobic aggression. In 2008, more than 60 immigrants were killed and over 30,000 people were forcefully displaced as a result of xenophobic attacks throughout South Africa. In 2009, the attacks were repeated and over 3,000 people were displaced in the Western Cape alone. PASSOP fights for the rights of this acutely <b>marginalised</b> <b>group</b> of people.|$|E

50|$|Like in {{many other}} western and non-western societies, public {{sentiment}} on homosexuality in China sits within a liminal space. While it is not outright condemned, neither is it fully accepted as {{being part of the}} social norm. In many instances, those who associate with the queer community also associate with another <b>marginalised</b> <b>group,</b> such as rural-to-urban migrants and sex workers, and therefore the stigma that is attached to aspects of queer identity is often a manifestation of perceived social disobedience against different intersecting vectors of 'moral rights'. As Elaine Jeffreys and Haiqing Yu note in their book, Sex in China, individuals who interact within the queer community do not necessarily identify as being homosexual. 'Money boys', men who provide commercial sexual services to other men, but do not identify as being homosexual, are an example of such a social group. Their minority status is imbued with aspects of criminality and poverty. This suggests that the 'perverseness' attached to homosexuality in Mainland China is not purely informed by a biological discourse, but, depending on the circumstances, can also be informed by accepted notions of cultural and social legitimacy.|$|E

5000|$|Duncan {{tended to}} {{identify}} as an Anglo-Indian, a somewhat <b>marginalised</b> <b>group</b> within the British Empire. Nine of her novels {{are set in}} India and most of her works are {{in the setting of}} Anglo-Indian society, of which she said [...] "there is such abundance of material ... it is full of such picturesque incidence, such tragic chance". The progress of her novels show her experimenting with different genres that might sell well or were known to be popular, and they were of increasing complexity. Generally, she followed a nineteenth-century tradition of [...] "society" [...] novels in which personal and public politics might play a part - epitomised by writers such as William Makepeace Thackeray and Anthony Trollope. Although she admired Howells and James, she did not often emulate them, with The Path of a Star (1899) being a notable exception. A recurring theme is an examination of the nature of authority and its relationship to autonomy, which was a topic that much concerned her mostly middle-class audience. Particularly adept with dialogue but less so with point of view, much of her work is also ironic in tone and, according to Dean, attempts [...] to define representative types of characters, often nationally or culturally differentiated. Her work frequently focuses on females, addressing their ethical and personal choices {{in the context of their}} dual imperative to develop as individuals and to represent moral ideas. Duncan thus creates a kind of heroine who defines herself through love, travel, and artistic vocation, and whose gender politics is linked to a critique of imperial-colonial relations.|$|E

Findings are drawn from a doctoral study examining the experiences of disabled students studying in Welsh higher education and analysis will focus on the views of students concerning their involvement and contribution to disability policy and provision. Discussion will include the reluctance of some students to participate in consultative exercises due to a questioning of disability identity and possible stigma, together with concerns about the genuineness and effectiveness of consultation. The benefits of participation will also be explored in relation to sharing experience, providing an alternative expertise to the professional and strengthening the interests of a <b>marginalised</b> <b>group...</b>|$|E

40|$|The paper {{argues that}} the {{practice}} of democratic mediation is an increasingly common, yet under-researched, component of engagements between citizens and public authorities across the globe. While the actors who mediate (and their tactics) are diverse and are not necessarily of the <b>marginalised</b> <b>group,</b> they share a commitment to overcoming representational, knowledge or ideological deficits in decision-making for the <b>marginalised</b> <b>group.</b> While the ‘speaking for’ nature of democratic mediation clearly opens up critical legitimacy problems, the practice of democratic mediation appears to be remarkably common, and even effective. The paper demonstrates this by surveying at least three kinds of democratic mediation observed across a large number of cases. First is ‘mediationas professional advocacy’. The mediator in these cases is more an ‘interested intermediary’ in contentious policy politics. In a context of skewed power relations where certain groups remain systematically marginalised, not least through knowledge and representational deficits, a degree of advocacy is required to get more egalitarian policy dialogue. Second is ‘mediation as representational entrepreneurship’. This refers to engagements between citizens and forms of public authority that stretch from the local to the global level. In more ‘global-local’ mobilisations, mediators are often experts, professionals, and international NGOs. In more ‘local – global’ movements, the mediators are ‘hybrid activists’ deeply rooted in the local identities and associations. However, in either case the actor is distinguished by the taking of initiative to include the voices of the marginalised in a domain of power-relations which is multi-level. Lastly, ‘mediation as citizenship development’ refers to forms of activism typically associated with community and capacity development, and usually involves limited advocacy by civil society organisations (CSOs). Hence there may be little by way of explicit mediation in local governance decision-making in these cases, although the empowerment of communities has a demonstrable and mostly positive impact on local governance...|$|E
