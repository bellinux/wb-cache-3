However, this space is not completely empty, and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles.

The inelastic <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>paths</b> of electrons in polythiophenes are measured with the elastic peak electron spectroscopy method using the Ag standard and the electron elastic scattering cross-sections from the database NIST 3. 1 in the electron kinetic energy range 200 – 5000 eV. The Monte Carlo model is applied for evaluating the electron backscattering intensities from the polymers and the Ag standard, {{as well as for}} evaluating electrons quasi-elastically backscat-tered from atoms of different atomic numbers (the recoil effect). The surface excitation corrections are accounted for using the formalism of Chen, with the material parameters for polythiophenes evaluated from the elastic peak electron spectroscopy method. Deviations due to recoil effect and surface excitations to the inelastic <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>paths</b> are compared and discussed. Correction to the inelastic <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>paths</b> due to recoil effect is consider-able but is smaller, however, than the correction due to surface excitations. Accounting for recoil effect and surface excitations leads to improvement of the inelastic <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>paths,</b> as compared to the inelastic <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>paths</b> resulting from the predictive formulae of Gries...|$|R

When probe electrons are near {{the surface of a}} solid or the interface of an overlayer system, electron inelastic <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>paths</b> become depth-dependent. These <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>paths</b> and surface excitation parameters were calculated for electrons crossing the surface of GaAs. Calculations were performed for both incident and outgoing electrons by the use of a dielectric response theory. Applications were made to estimate the elastic backscattering intensity of electrons at different emission angles using the Monte Carlo simulations. Good agreement was found between calculated results and experimental data on the ratio of the elastic reflection coefficient for a GaAs sample relative to a Ni reference. Such a ratio was used to determine the effective electron inelastic <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>paths</b> in GaAs by employing the surface excitation parameter obtained from Monte Carlo simulations...|$|R
5|$|Outer {{space is}} the closest known {{approximation}} to a perfect vacuum. It has effectively no friction, allowing stars, planets and moons to move freely along their ideal orbits. However, even the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter, as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. By comparison, the air humans breathe contains about 1025 molecules per cubic meter. The low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered: the <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>path</b> of a photon in intergalactic space is about 1023km, or 10 billion light years. In spite of this, extinction, which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas, {{is an important factor}} in galactic and intergalactic astronomy.|$|E

25|$|The {{limitations}} {{of the concept of}} speed of sound due to extreme attenuation are also of concern. The attenuation which exists at sea level for high frequencies applies to successively lower frequencies as atmospheric pressure decreases, or as the <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>path</b> increases. For this reason, the concept of speed of sound (except for frequencies approaching zero) progressively loses its range of applicability at high altitudes. The standard equations for the speed of sound apply with reasonable accuracy only to situations in which the wavelength of the soundwave is considerably longer than the <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>path</b> of molecules in a gas.|$|E
40|$|We {{establish}} {{the extent to}} which photons and dileptons are penetrating probes of hot hadronic matter by computing <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>paths.</b> Absorption is indeed negligible for real photons as <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>paths</b> are roughly tenths of öms. However, vector dominance effects, which provide rich structure in virtual photon mass spectra, introduce nonnegligible reabsorption and rehadronization resulting in <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>paths</b> of the order of tens of femtometers. Consequences are illustrated by considering the net dilepton yield near the rho peak via thermal ππ annihilation from a short-lived hadronic fireball. Results suggest that disappearance of the rho in heavy-ion collisions can be due in part to reabsorption/rehadronization rather than solely due to collective effects.

25|$|The {{validity}} of the continuum assumption {{is dependent on the}} density of the gas and the application in question. For the continuum assumption to be valid, the <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>path</b> length must be much smaller than the length scale of the application in question. For example, many aerodynamics applications deal with aircraft flying in atmospheric conditions, where the <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>path</b> length is on the order of micrometers and where the body is orders of magnitude larger. In these cases, the length scale of the aircraft ranges from a few meters to a few tens of meters, which is much larger than the <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>path</b> length. For such applications, the continuum assumption is reasonable. The continuum assumption is less valid for extremely low-density flows, such as those encountered by vehicles at very high altitudes (e.g. 300,000ft/90km) or satellites in Low Earth orbit. In those cases, statistical mechanics is a more accurate method of solving the problem than is continuum aerodynamics. The Knudsen number can be used to guide the choice between statistical mechanics and the continuous formulation of aerodynamics.|$|E
25|$|To {{increase}} the <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>path</b> {{of the electron}} gas interaction, a standard TEM is evacuated to low pressures, typically {{on the order of}} 10−4 Pa. The need for this is twofold: first the allowance for the voltage difference between the cathode and the ground without generating an arc, and secondly to reduce the collision frequency of electrons with gas atoms to negligible levels—this effect is characterized by the <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>path.</b> TEM components such as specimen holders and film cartridges must be routinely inserted or replaced requiring a system with the ability to re-evacuate on a regular basis. As such, TEMs are equipped with multiple pumping systems and airlocks and are not permanently vacuum sealed.|$|E
25|$|James Clerk Maxwell {{published}} a famous paper in 1866 using the kinetic theory of gases to study gaseous viscosity. To {{understand why the}} viscosity is independent of pressure, consider two adjacent boundary layers (A and B) moving with respect to each other. The internal friction (the viscosity) of the gas {{is determined by the}} probability a particle of layer A enters layer B with a corresponding transfer of momentum. Maxwell's calculations show that the viscosity coefficient is proportional to the density, the <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>path,</b> and the mean velocity of the atoms. On the other hand, the <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>path</b> is inversely proportional to the density. So an increase in density due to an increase in pressure doesn't result in any change in viscosity.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} metals in their solid state {{helps to explain}} the unusually high {{electrical}} conductivity of copper. In a copper atom, the outermost 4s energy zone, or conduction band, is only half filled, so many electrons are able to carry electric current. When an electric field is applied to a copper wire, the conduction of electrons accelerates towards the electropositive end, thereby creating a current. These electrons encounter resistance to their passage by colliding with impurity atoms, vacancies, lattice ions, and imperfections. The average distance travelled between collisions, defined as the “mean free path,” is inversely proportional to the resistivity of the metal. What is unique about copper is its long <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>path</b> (approximately 100 atomic spacings at room temperature). This <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>path</b> increases rapidly as copper is chilled.|$|E

25|$|Samuel Tolver Preston {{illustrated}} {{that many}} of the postulates introduced by Le Sage concerning the gravitational particles, such as rectilinear motion, rare interactions, etc.., could be collected under the single notion that they behaved (on the cosmological scale) as the particles of a gas with an extremely long <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>path.</b> Preston also accepted Kelvin's proposal of internal energy modes of the particles. He illustrated Kelvin's model by comparing it with the collision of a steel ring and an anvil - the anvil would not be shaken very much, but the steel ring would be in a state of vibration and therefore departs with diminished velocity. He also argued, that the <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>path</b> of the particles is at least the distance between the planets - on longer distances the particles regain their translational energy due collisions with each other, so he concluded that on longer distances there would be no attraction between the bodies, independent of their size.

However the description with Gogny forces differs from the previous and <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>paths</b> stay almonst unchanged or decrease at densities [1 - 2]ρ_ 0.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{transport}} coefficients, damping rates and <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>paths</b> of soft fermion collective excitations {{in a hot}} fermion-gauge-scalar plasma {{with the goal of}} understanding the main physical mechanisms that determine transport of chirality in scenarios of non-local electroweak baryogenesis. The focus is on identifying the different transport coefficients for the different branches of soft collective excitations of the fermion spectrum. These branches correspond to collective excitations with opposite ratios of chirality to helicity and different dispersion relations. By combining results from the hard thermal loop (HTL) resummation program with a novel mechanism of fermion damping through heavy scalar decay, we obtain a robust description of the different damping rates and <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>paths</b> for the soft collective excitations to leading order in HTL and lowest order in the Yukawa coupling. The space-time evolution of wave packets of collective excitations unambiguously reveals the respective <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>paths.</b> We find that whereas both the gauge and scalar contribution to the damping rates are different for the different branches, the difference of <b>mean</b> <b>free</b> <b>paths</b> for both branches is mainly determined by the decay of the heavy scalar into a hard fermion and a soft collective excitation.
