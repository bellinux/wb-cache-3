5|$|In 2005, Kirthana Ramisetti of Entertainment Weekly posted that The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., {{deserved}} to be released on DVD. Gord Lacey, {{the creator of the}} website TVShowsonDVD.com, told the New York Daily News that Brisco was among the five most requested shows on the site.

On July 18, 2006, Warner Home Video released The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.: The Complete Series on DVD in Region 1, an 8-disc DVD set that contains all 27 episodes of the series.

5|$|The game {{features}} two distinctive {{modes of}} play - a single player campaign and multiplayer matches. In both modes, players {{are put into}} a first-person perspective from within the cockpit of a starfighter and have full control over their craft, but the only visible part is the interface - the head-up display (HUD) - which can be customised with different colours and by what information is displayed. Outside of these modes, the main <b>menu</b> <b>of</b> the game is designed around {{the interior of a}} ship's quarterdeck, with various elements (mostly doors) leading to different options, such as starting a new game, configuring the game, reviewing the crafts featured in the game and various story elements, and replaying completed single player missions.|$|E

5|$|The {{restaurant}} {{came close}} to going bankrupt, Blumenthal sold his house, his car {{and many of his}} possessions {{in order to keep the}} restaurant afloat. After four years, the restaurant was awarded its first Michelin star in the 1999 list. Blumenthal worked with Professor Peter Barham of the University of Bristol, and developed a <b>menu</b> <b>of</b> dishes through experimentation such as slow-cooked lamb which avoids shocking the fibres in the meat and causing them to seize. By 2000, techniques were being used such as cooking vegetables in mineral water after discovering that the levels of calcium in tap water causes their discolouration, and freezing cuttlefish to break down the molecules in them in order to increase their tenderness. In 2001 it was awarded a second Michelin star, and was also named Restaurant of the Year by The Automobile Association.|$|E

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} protein intake in the <b>menus</b> <b>of</b> school canteens. The first aim of my bachelor thesis is {{to map out}} the amount of protein in the <b>menus</b> <b>of</b> school canteens. The second objective is to assess by observing how many children eat the protein foods in the school canteens. A comparation <b>of</b> the <b>menus</b> <b>of</b> three selected school canteens was the third goal. In the theoretical part of the bachelor thesis I focus on basic information about proteins, such as protein distribution, protein metabolism, protein utilization, their need, lack and excess of protein {{as well as the}} need of protein during a childhood. I also mention individual protein foods in connection with the consumer basket. To achieve the aim of the practical part of the bachelor thesis, I used the acquired menus from three selected school canteens from Prague. I have processed the data I obtained in the nutritional program Nutriservis and I obtained data on the amount of protein in the <b>menus</b> <b>of</b> each school canteens. By observing children in these school canteens, I was gained an insight into how many protein foods they eat. The bachelor's thesis could serve as an inspiration for school canteen leaders in the future. According to the results of the research, there {{is just one of the}} three school canteens, that serves the optimum value of protein in their menus in accordance with consumer basket. But children actually eat less protein foods than this optimal value...|$|R
