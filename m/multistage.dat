5|$|There {{were many}} {{advances}} and new designs in gunpowder weapons during {{the beginning of}} the dynasty, but by the mid to late Ming the Chinese began to frequently employ European-style artillery and firearms. The Huolongjing, compiled by Jiao Yu and Liu Bowen sometime before the latter's death on 16 May 1375 (with a preface added by Jiao in 1412), featured many types of cutting-edge gunpowder weaponry for the time. This includes hollow, gunpowder-filled exploding cannonballs, land mines that used a complex trigger mechanism of falling weights, pins, and a steel wheellock to ignite the train of fuses, naval mines, fin-mounted winged rockets for aerodynamic control, <b>multistage</b> rockets propelled by booster rockets before igniting a swarm of smaller rockets issuing forth {{from the end of the}} missile (shaped like a dragon's head), and hand cannons that had up to ten barrels.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} region {{now known}} as China experienced a history involving mechanics, hydraulics and mathematics applied to horology, metallurgy, astronomy, agriculture, engineering, music theory, craftsmanship, naval architecture and warfare. By the Warring States period (403–221 BC), inhabitants of the Warring States had advanced metallurgic technology, including the blast furnace and cupola furnace, while the finery forge and puddling process were known by the Han Dynasty (202 BC–AD 220). A sophisticated economic system in imperial China gave birth to inventions such as paper money during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). The invention of gunpowder during the mid 9th century led to an array of inventions such as the fire lance, land mine, naval mine, hand cannon, exploding cannonballs, <b>multistage</b> rocket and rocket bombs with aerodynamic wings and explosive payloads. With the navigational aid of the 11th century compass and ability to steer at high sea with the 1st century sternpost rudder, premodern Chinese sailors sailed as far as East Africa. In water-powered clockworks, the premodern Chinese had used the escapement mechanism since the 8th century and the endless power-transmitting chain drive in the 11th century. They also made large mechanical puppet theaters driven by waterwheels and carriage wheels and wine-serving automatons driven by paddle wheel boats.|$|E

In particular, we address the problems of higher order error in a discrete fiber model and limit of <b>multistaged</b> PMD compensation schemes.

40|$|AbstractMicrofibrillated celluloses (MFC) {{extraction}} from “ijuk” fibers with chemically <b>multistages</b> {{method has}} been investigated. The fibers were prepared by alkalinization with 10 % sodium hydroxide (NaOH), oxidation with 3 - 6 % sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and hydrolysis with 20 % sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4), respectively. The alkalinization removes the fiber surface components such as lignin and wax so the pore {{on the surface}} clearly appeared. Addition of NaClO leads an oxidative fragmentation from remaining lignin and then the lignin dissolve out from the fiber. Furthermore, hydrolysis fibrilates fiber into MFC and annihillates the amorphous parts in MFC by keeping the crystalline parts. Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) confirmed the removal of some cellulosic components such as lignin, wax and hemicelluloses, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) reveals an increasing of crystalline parts in the fiber. The micrograph by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) displayed dimension and surface morphology of MFC. The experimental indicated that <b>multistages</b> preparation with 6 % NaClO resulted better fibrillation and crystallinity than 3 % NaClO. The microfibrillated celluloses resulted from this <b>multistages</b> preparation, has some potential applications, such as filler and nucleating agent in polymer, which are studied in the next study...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — XML {{is one of}} {{the most}} used {{languages}} in the Web and is frequently used to describe large parts of web applications. A common approach to reduce complexity of web applications relying on XML is to use a <b>multistaged</b> architecture in form of a transformation pipeline. These pipelines usually employ a fixed set of complex transformations to convert an XML source document into a displayable output format. A second common principle is to separate a web application’s context-independent part from the contextdependent adaptation facet. In this paper, we present a generic approach that uses aspect-oriented programming (AOP) to separate and weave the adaptation facet of XML-based web applications using a <b>multistaged</b> architecture. We introduce an AOP-based terminology for adaptation aspects and present an existing aspect weaver prototype that realises our approach.

Later he developed the <b>multistage</b> test, consisting of several stages of progressively greater workloads. It was this <b>multistage</b> test, a description of which was first published in 1963, that became known as the Bruce Protocol. In the initial paper, Bruce reported that the test could detect signs of such conditions as angina pectoris, a previous heart attack, or a ventricular aneurysm.

25|$|In a {{two-stage}} digestion system (<b>multistage),</b> different digestion {{vessels are}} optimised to bring maximum {{control over the}} bacterial communities living within the digesters. Acidogenic bacteria produce organic acids and more quickly grow and reproduce than methanogenic bacteria. Methanogenic bacteria require stable pH and temperature to optimise their performance.|$|E
25|$|Anaerobic digesters can be {{designed}} and engineered to operate using {{a number of different}} configurations and can be categorized into batch vs. continuous process mode, mesophilic vs. thermophilic temperature conditions, high vs. low portion of solids, and single stage vs. <b>multistage</b> processes. More initial build money and a larger volume of the batch digester is needed to handle the same amount of waste as a continuous process digester. Higher heat energy is demanded in a thermophilic system compared to a mesophilic system and has a larger gas output capacity and higher methane gas content. For solids content, low will handle up to 15% solid content. Above this level is considered high solids content and can also be known as dry digestion. In a single stage process, one reactor houses the four anaerobic digestion steps. A <b>multistage</b> process utilizes two or more reactors for digestion to separate the methanogenesis and hydrolysis phases.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we develop methods for {{dynamically}} downscaling output from six general circulation models (GCMs) for two emissions scenarios using a variable-resolution atmospheric climate model. The use of multiple GCMs and emissions scenarios gives an estimate of model range in projected changes to the mean climate across the region. By modeling the atmosphere at a very fine scale, the simulations capture processes {{that are important to}} regional weather and climate at length scales that are subgrid scale for the host GCM. We find that with a <b>multistaged</b> process of increased resolution and the application of bias adjustment methods, the ability of the simulation to reproduce observed conditions improves, with greater than 95 % of the spatial variance explained for temperature and about 90 % for rainfall. Furthermore, downscaling leads to a significant improvement for the temporal distribution of variables commonly used in applied analyses, reproducing seasonal variability in line with observations. This seasonal signal is not evident in the GCMs. This <b>multistaged</b> approach allows progressive improvement in the skill of the simulations in order to resolve key processes over the region with quantifiable improvements in the correlations with observations...|$|R
