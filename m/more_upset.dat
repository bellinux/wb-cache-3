On December 6, Dulles held a news conference during which he reaffirmed U.S. {{neutrality}} on the Goa issue, but did not recant claims of Portuguese sovereignty over the region. Prime Minister Nehru announced his intent to file a formal protest with the United States over the communiqué and to address the Indian Parliament about the matter.

[...] He resented Johnson's lack of enthusiasm for his writing and with the character of 'Pomposo', written as one of the more credulous of the ghost's investigators, used the satire to highlight a [...] "superstitious streak" [...] in his subject. [...] Johnson paid this scant attention, but was said to have been <b>more</b> <b>upset</b> when Churchill again mocked him for his delay in releasing Shakespeare.

[...] The newspapers searched for evidence of past impostures and referenced older publications such as Reginald Scot's Discoverie of Witchcraft (1584). [...] The ghost was referenced in an anonymous work entitled Anti-Canidia: or, Superstition Detected and Exposed (1762), which sought to ridicule the credulity of those involved in the Cock Lane case. [...] The author described his work as a [...] "sally of indignation at the contemptible wonder in Cock-lane". [...] Works such as The Orators (1762) by Samuel Foote, were soon available. [...] Farcical poems such as Cock-lane Humbug were released, theatres staged plays such as The Drummer and The Haunted House.|$|E

40|$|Objective GPs {{sometimes}} use euphemisms {{rather than}} medical terms. The present study {{aimed to explore}} the relative impact of using the term ‘obese’ compared to GPs’ preferred euphemism on patients’ beliefs about the problem. Methods A cross sectional survey followed by an experimental study was used with two conditions: the term ‘obese’ versus the GPs’ preferred euphemism. In the cross sectional survey, GPs’ (n = 19) described their preferred use of term. In the experimental study, patients (n = 449) from one General Practice in West London then completed a set of ratings about their beliefs following a vignette using either the term ‘obese’ or the GPs’ preferred euphemism. Results The first stage of the study showed that GPs avoided using the term ‘obese’ and preferred to use a euphemism. The most commonly used euphemism was ‘your weight may be damaging your health’. The second stage showed that the term ‘obese’ made patients believe that the problem had more serious consequences and made them feel <b>more</b> anxious and <b>upset</b> than when the same symptoms were labelled using the euphemism. When analysed according to the patient's own BMI, however, {{the results showed that}} the term ‘obese’ had a greater emotional impact than the euphemism only on patients who were not obese; obese patients found the euphemism <b>more</b> <b>upsetting.</b> Conclusion GPs avoid using the term ‘obese’ for fear of upsetting patients. This term, whilst making the problem appear more serious is only <b>more</b> <b>upsetting</b> for non-obese patients. Practice implications GPs choice of term therefore needs to reflect whether they want the patients to be upset or whether they want them to accept the seriousness of their problem...|$|R

2500|$|For one researcher, Symons (1979), sexual jealously is {{the major}} cause that {{homosexual}} men are supposedly unsuccessful in maintaining monogamous relationships (Harris, 2002). [...] Symons suggests {{that all men are}} innately disposed to want sexual variation and that the difference between heterosexual and homosexual men is that homosexual men can find willing partners more often for casual sex, and thus satisfy this innate desire for sexual variety. However, according to this view, all men are hard wired to be sexually jealous; therefore suggesting that gay men should be <b>more</b> <b>upset</b> by sexual infidelity than by emotional infidelity, and that lesbians should be <b>more</b> <b>upset</b> by emotional infidelity than compared to sexual infidelity (Harris, 2002). Recent studies suggest that in fact it may not be an innate mechanism but that it depends on the importance placed on sexual exclusivity. Peplau and Cochran (1983) found that sexual exclusivity was much more important to heterosexual men and women compared to homosexual men and women. This theory suggests that it is not sexuality that may lead to differences but that people are prone to jealousy in domains that are especially important to them.|$|E

2500|$|These {{inconsistent}} {{results have}} led researchers to propose novel theories {{that attempt to}} explain the sex differences observed in certain studies.One theory that has been hypothesized to explain why men and women both report more distress to emotional infidelity than sexual infidelity is borrowed from childhood attachment theories. [...] Studies have found that attachment styles of adults are consistent with their self reported relationship histories. For example, more men are reported to have an insecure, dismissing avoidant attachment style; where these [...] "individuals often attempt to minimize or constrict emotional experience, deny needs for intimacy, are highly invested in autonomy, and are more sexually promiscuous than individuals who have other attachment styles". [...] Levy and Kelly (2010) tested this theory and found that adult attachment styles strongly correlate to which type of infidelity elicited more jealousy. [...] Individuals who have secure attachment styles often report that emotional infidelity is <b>more</b> <b>upsetting</b> whereas dismissing attachment styles {{were more likely to}} find sexual infidelity <b>more</b> <b>upsetting.</b> It is important to note however that their study did report that men in general were more likely than women to report sexual infidelity as more distressing, however this could be related to more men having a dismissing attachment style.The authors propose that a social mechanism may be responsible for the observed results. In other words, replicable sex differences in emotion and sexual jealousy could be a function of a social function. Similar studies focusing on the masculinization and feminization by society also argue for a social explanation, while discounting an evolutionary explanation.|$|R

2500|$|A common way to {{test whether}} an innate jealousy {{response}} exists between sexes {{is to use a}} forced-choice questionnaire.

For example, a question might ask, [...] "If you found your partner cheating on you would you be <b>more</b> <b>upset</b> by (A) the sexual involvement or (B) the emotional involvement". As the name implies, one is forced to choose between the two options. Many studies using forced choice questionnaires have found statistically significant results supporting an innate sex difference between men and women.

Sonnet 64 catalogues instances of inevitable destruction so as to provide a consolation for death and places [...] "emphasis on the inescapable fact of mutability". Because of the inevitability and finality of death, Shakespeare's lover is not choosing to leave him. On the contrary, his lover could not do anything about it. In this way, Shakespeare is able to feel better about himself, because {{the love of his life}} was taken from him involuntarily.
