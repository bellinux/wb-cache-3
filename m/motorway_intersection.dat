40|$|ABSTRACT: Fifteen (15) {{reinforced}} concrete structures consisting of buildings in greater Johannesburg city area and major bridges at various <b>motorway</b> <b>intersections</b> were surveyed for active carbonation deterioration. This {{has been part}} of an ongoing field study conducted on the structures since 20001.

The statistical variability for durability design parameters of compressive strength, carbonation depth, and carbonation rate were established. The field data verify the validity of an environmentally sensitive carbonation deterioration model. The probabilistic assessment results are compared with findings of the deterministic approach 1...|$|R

This same stretch was rebuilt shortly afterwards when it was expanded to four lanes up through Gumböle during the 1990s. Throughout the 1980s, stretches of Kehä III were completed to the Lahti motorway and in the 1990s to the Porvoo motorway. The road to Vuosaari Harbour, completed in 2007, extends from the eastern endpoint of Kehä III.

40|$|Roundabouts {{have been}} a key form of {{junction}} in the UK for many years.

Following a state-of-the-art review of international roundabout design, this paper reviews the research into accidents at roundabouts in the light of issues for the revised UK Geometric Design Standard. In order to meet the needs of modern roads, the revised Standard is likely to adopt a hierarchical approach, with different designs for roundabouts on rural and urban roads, the intention being to place much greater emphasis on the interests of vulnerable road users...|$|R

40|$|There are {{factors that}} impact car usage in urban areas, such as density, {{diversity}} and design, {{but there have}} been few studies that examine the relationship between street network factors and car usage at the city level (macro level).

The street network in this study includes interconnecting lines and points that present streets, roads, <b>motorways,</b> <b>intersections</b> and blocks. The strength of the relationship in this study is found using multiple linear regression. The findings of this research indicate that an increase in car usage is correlated with an increasing number of blocks per area, number of nodes per block and length of motorways.

5000|$|Simister is a {{small village}} in Prestwich, within the Metropolitan Borough of Bury, Greater Manchester. Historically part of Lancashire, it is located between the districts of Prestwich, Rhodes and Langley.

Thousands of vehicles a day use this <b>motorway</b> <b>intersection</b> and the traffic noise is often regarded as a nuisance but {{not a part of}} the village by the residents. Although the village's proximity to Manchester means the residential population is mainly made up of commuters, the village has a rural feel with much agricultural activity.

40|$|There {{are various}} {{factors that affect}} walking and cycling in urban areas, such as density, {{diversity}} and design, {{but there have been}} few studies that examine the relationship between urban morphology factors such as street network and green travel modes (e. g., walking and cycling) at the city-level (macro-level). Thus, this paper focuses on this relationship by introducing street network morphology factors, such as blocks per area, nodes per blocks and nodes per area. The street network in this study includes interconnecting lines and points that present streets, roads, <b>motorways,</b> <b>intersections</b> and blocks. The percentage of daily trips on foot and by bicycle data that represents walking and cycling are collected from the International Association of Public Transport’s (UITP) database. The blocks per area, nodes per area and the nodes per blocks are estimated by modifying and analyzing Open Street Maps (OSM). The data that are used in this study are from 30 cities {{in different parts of the}} world. The strength of the relationship in this study was found using the Pearson correlation coefficient. The results show that increase in daily trips on foot and by bicycle is correlated with increasing number of blocks per area and number of nodes per area while daily trips on foot and by bicycle has negative relationship with number of nodes per blocks. Because the urban street network is the result of macroscale planning decisions, considering the relationship between street network morphology and travel behavior can lead to better planning decisions...|$|R
30|$|The {{developed}} models enabled both {{identification of}} {{hazardous road locations}} (network safety ranking) and evaluation of safety of planned infrastructure (road safety impact assessment). The models also provided interpretation of influence of statistically significant risk factors. Effects of typical variables (AADT, length, number of intersection legs, etc.) were consistent with literature [68]. On the other hand, several variables did not have sufficiently significant effect (for example channelization, parking space along <b>motorway</b> or <b>intersection</b> bypass lanes). However, {{it is important to}} note, that the reported effects are only associations; in order to capture causal effects, one would need to conduct before-after studies. Another caveat is that although original dataset was relatively large, there is always a risk of omitted variable bias [54]. Examples of variables, which were not taken into account, may include for example speed behaviour. Another issue was use of proportions of observed accident severities in obtaining accident severity frequencies, caused by sample size limitations. While this has been used by some authors [58], it was noted as potentially biased, due to ignoring correlations between severities and traffic volumes [75].|$|R
50|$|South of Croydon {{the road}} {{passed through the}} Caterham Gap in the North Downs; this natural {{corridor}} has been heavily developed with modern roads and railways, along with suburban housing, obliterating much of the ancient road. The road can, however, be found east of Caterham where the road curves around {{the west side of}} Tillingdown on a terraceway, marking the boundary between developed and undeveloped land. A distinct metalled agger was found at the northern end, while on the terrace it was 25 ft wide and well metalled with flint to a maximum depth of 12 in. As is often the case with Roman roads a parish boundary follows the line. The Roman line joins the lower part of Tillingdown Lane, then the B2030 road and A22 Caterham Bypass before becoming a lane east of the A22 as it approaches the M25 <b>motorway</b> where the <b>intersection</b> is on the Roman line.|$|R

Analysis of flows at a busy <b>motorway</b> <b>intersection</b> near Manchester, UK, highlights two important modelling issues: accommodating different levels of traffic variability depending on the time of day and accommodating measurement errors occurring due to data collection errors. This paper extends LMDMs to address these issues. Additionally, the paper investigates how close the approximate forecast limits usually used with the LMDM are to the true, but not so readily available, forecast limits...|$|E
40|$|Ballard’s complex {{evocation}} of the spaces of Concrete Island (1974) belies {{the simplicity of the}} structures that surround them. Before the construction of the Westway in the late 1960 s the huge <b>motorway</b> <b>intersection</b> was shown as a smooth plastic ribbon laid atop the grittiness of run down and densely occupied 19 th century housing of North Kensington. The spaces between were not considered. But Concrete Island celebrates this disappearing domain by tracing out fragments of its history, drawing an archaeology, but also expanding the ways that architectural spaces may be understood by paying attention to their sensual qualities. This paper examines the ways that the spaces of Concrete Island can be understood in the context of Rosalind Krauss’s concept of the expanded field, and suggests that considering the novel {{as an example of the}} expanded field helps us to pay attention to ‘spaces between’. Situated at a very specific moment of change, in the arts and in technological advances, Ballard looks backwards and forwards in time, and questions the stability of time and place. By taking de Certeau’s understanding of the detailed movements of pedestrians in the city as analogous with writing, I seek to develop a way forward to the production of drawn responses that acknowledge this expanding field. My argument focuses on Ballard’s metaphorical use of tactile, material qualities, demonstrating how rapid changes in the environment may be felt through his representation of the grass that thrives in between the giant structures of the Westway and M 4 motorways. By reference to historical and contemporary writing on the psychogeographic affects associated with walking through the urban environment, I reveal how Ballard tells the story of a destabilised understanding of place that is, all the same, responsive to human intervention...|$|E
30|$|The {{aim is to}} {{gain more}} insight in {{what happens on the}} road on a day to day basis trying to {{understand}} who will engage in risky driving behaviour when and where. To achieve this, this research area includes questionnaire data that is acquired {{in the beginning of the}} study. Driver characteristics such as age, gender, driving experience, sensation seeking [14] and locus of control [15] are assessed. Additionally drivers fill in the Driver Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ; Parker et al. 1995), the Driver Attitude Questionnaire (DAQ; [16]) and the Driving Style Questionnaire (DSQ, [17]). This battery of driver characteristics will be compared to the actual driving behaviour (i.e. risk taking and potential conflicts). Relevant variables of the vehicle include video data identifying situational variables inside the vehicle, for example, whether and how many passengers were present and whether a seatbelt was worn. Additionally using video data, temporal factors (day/night, rush hours) can be identified. The positioning data will be used to identify the environment road type (single carriageway, <b>motorway),</b> road geometry (<b>intersection,</b> link, bend, junction), locality (urban, rural). Drivers’ characteristics will be compared with risk managing behaviours such as maintaining a greater safety distance. Data acquired with vehicle- and built-in sensors together with a smart camera will be utilized to derive driving patterns. They allow measuring speeding, time headway and lateral g-force to identify risky manoeuvres.|$|R
50|$|The final {{segment of}} the A4 with the A29, starts in the {{province}} of North Brabant near Heijningen at the interchange Hellegatsplein, crossing the estuaries Hollands Diep (to the east), Haringvliet and the Volkerak (to the west). Shortly hereafter, the A4 enters the trumpet interchange Sabina with the <b>motorway</b> A59. This <b>intersection</b> is named after a fort that was built nearby. The A29 and the A59 both enter this interchange from the north and the A29 ends here. The A4 continues to the south, while the A59 branches off to the east. Crossing the Dintel and passing by Dinteloord, the road makes a large curve to the west and subsequently continues to the south, forming a tangent around Steenbergen. In {{the southern part of the}} curve, the A4 travels along Fort Henricus, a now demolished fort with only the shape of the land intact. Here, the road also tunnels under the Steenbergse Haven, using the third aqueduct of the motorway A4, aqueduct Steenbergen aan Zee. The A4 continues southbound and passes Bergen op Zoom to the east, with a few exits serving this city. Between exits 27 and 28, the A58 concurrents with the E 312 join A4 to the south. All three roads travel concurrently southbound and at trumpet interchange Markiezaat, the A58 and the E 312 both leave the A4 and travel to the west, entering the province of Zeeland. The A4 however travels its final kilometers to the south until reaching the Belgian border near Zandvliet. A few meters before crossing the border, the northbound entrance and southbound exit ramps start on Dutch soil, the rest off this exit is positioned on Belgian soil and is part of the Belgian A12.|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{a robust}} roads network on bicycle traffic; Results {{obtained}} from a microsimulation model. The traffic flow on the Dutch main road network is problematic due to intensive use and near stagnant capacity. As a result the accessibility of the economic centres is still under heavy pressure. In 2008, the Royal Dutch Touring Club ANWB made public its vision on the road network. This vision, known as the Robust roads network {{is intended to be}} the answer to the increasing vulnerability of the present road network for disturbances of the traffic flow. SWOV, together with ANWB, carried out a pilot study into the safety effects of a robust roads network. This pilot study found relatively small differences between the Sustainable Safety vision and the Robust roads network, for both traffic flow and road safety. It seems feasible to integrate the two visions into a system that offers a larger traffic flow {{and at the same time}} provides optimal safety. The pilot study did not yet answer the question of which effects a robust roads network would have on bicycle traffic. At the same time, however, motorized through traffic will (incidentally) make more use of the secondary roads network and at those locations interfere with bicycle traffic. The present report, therefore, has attempted to find answers to the following questions: 1. Which effects on road safety are to be expected when robust roads networks are introduced? 2. Can these effects be quantified? 3. Which measures can be taken to prevent possible adverse consequences? The effects of a robust roads network on bicycle traffic has been investigated with the microsimulation model S-Paramics. In this model a road network was simulated in which part of the car traffic made use of the secondary roads after an incident had occurred on the main roads network. An intersecting bicycle path was simulated at one of the secondary roads. This gives an impression of the hindrance (flow, safety) that bicycle traffic can experience at intersections when the car traffic uses the secondary roads as an alternative. The microsimulation model does not (yet) have the possibility of simulating the hindrance cyclists may experience at road sections. The present study has established that the greatest effects on traffic flow may be observed at intersections with priority for car traffic. At this type of intersection, bicycle traffic flow is obstructed when car traffic uses secondary roads as an alternative. There are no adverse road safety effects at this intersection type. Adverse safety effects do indeed occur at intersections with priority for cyclists. This type of intersection enables good traffic flow for cyclists despite the increase in car traffic (due to the incident on the <b>motorway).</b> The <b>intersection</b> with traffic light control achieves good flow as well as safety for both bicycle and car. It must be noted, however, that the simulation model underestimates the dangers at this intersection type, as, other than in reality, the model does not allow for going through a red light...|$|R
40|$|President’s Message Hello fellow AITPM members, We’ve {{been offered}} a lot of press lately about the Federal Government’s plan for the multibillion dollar rollout of its high speed {{broadband}} network, which {{at the moment is}} being rated to a speed of 100 Mb/s. This seems fantastic in comparison to the not atypical 250 to 500 kb/s that I receive on my metropolitan cable broadband, which incidentally my service provider rates at theoretical speeds of up to 8 Mb/s. I have no doubt that such a scheme will generate significant advantages to business and consumers. However, I also have some reservations. Only a few of years ago I marvelled at my first 256 Mb USB stick, which cost my employer about 90. Last month I purchased a 16 Gb stick with a free computer carry bag for 80, which {{on the back of my}} envelope has given me about 72 times the value of my first USB stick not including the carry bag! I am pretty sure the technology industry will find a way to eventually push a lot more than 100 Mb/s down the optic fibre network just as they have done with pushing several Mb/s ADSL 2 down antique copper wire. This makes me wonder about the general problem of inbuilt obsolescence of all things high-tech due to rapid advances in the tech industry. As a transport professional I then think to myself that our industry has been moving forward at somewhat of a slower pace. We certainly have had major milestones having significant impacts, such as the move from horse and cart to the self propelled motor vehicle, sealing and formal geometric design of roads, development of <b>motorways,</b> signalisation of <b>intersections,</b> coordination of networks, to simulation modelling for real time adaptive control (perhaps major change has been at a frequency of 30 years or so?). But now with ITS truly penetrating the transport market, largely thanks to the in-car GPS navigator, smart phone, e-toll and e-ticket, I believe that to avoid our own obsolescence we’re going to need to “plan for ITS” rather than just what we seem to have been doing up until now, that is, to get it out there. And we’ll likely need to do it at a faster pace. It will involve understanding how to data mine enormous data sets, better understanding the human/machine interface, keeping pace with automotive technology more closely, resolving the ethical and privacy chestnuts, and in the main actually planning for ITS to make peoples’ lives easier rather than harder. And in amongst this we’ll need to keep pace with the types of technology advances similar to my USB stick example above. All the while we’ll be making a brand new set of friends in the disciplines that will morph into ITS along with us. Hopefully these will all be “good” problems for our profession to have. I should close in reminding everyone again that AITPM’s flagship event, the 2009 AITPM National Conference, Traffic Beyond Tomorrow, is being held in Adelaide from 5 to 7 August. www. aitpm. com has all of the details about how to register, sponsor a booth, session, etc. Best regards all, Jon Bunke...|$|R
