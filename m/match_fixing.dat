5|$|There {{appear to}} be no extant records of the {{meetings}} which elected Arsenal to the First Division in 1919, however the book Making the Arsenal proposes a different reason for their election in that year. The site argues that the <b>match</b> <b>fixing</b> issues of {{the final year of}} football before the war (1914–15) were used by Norris as a weapon in his battle to get Arsenal promoted. He demanded that Liverpool and Manchester United (some of who's players had been found guilty of <b>match</b> <b>fixing)</b> be punished by relegation or expulsion, and threatened to organise a breakaway from the league by Midlands and southern clubs if nothing was done. To placate him the League offered Arsenal a place in the First Division.|$|E
5|$|Former Indian player Prabhakaralso {{publicly}} {{claimed that}} Kapil wanted {{to throw away}} a match against Pakistan. Prabhakar's allegations against an unknown team member was not new as he made these allegations to a magazine The Outlook in 1997 based on which BCCI instituted the Chandrachud Inquiry, a one man commission headed by retired Chief Justice of India Yeshwant Vishnu Chandrachud. Prabhakar did not reveal names or provide evidence of his charges (<b>match</b> <b>fixing</b> and phone tapping allegation on then cricket manager Ajit Wadekar). When the <b>match</b> <b>fixing</b> controversy resurfaced in 2000, BCCI released the Chandrachud Report to the media. The reaction of the Indian public resulted in PILs and International Cricket Council and the BCCI were called to respond in the Delhi and Calcutta High Courts. In response to the crisis, the Indian government initiated a CBI inquiry on 28 April 2000. Former BCCI President Inderjit Singh Bindra revealed on 4 May 2000 that Prabhakar told him that Kapil asked him to throw away the match. During the ensuing exchanges between various parties, Kapil Dev broke down {{in an interview on}} BBC's Hard Talk with Karan Thapar.|$|E

While some former players and cricket administrators suspected a case of <b>match</b> <b>fixing,</b> no material evidence supporting this has emerged. After his retirement from cricket, Collins used his gambling knowledge to start a career in horse racing, working as a bookmaker and commission agent.|$|E

30|$|In {{line with}} earlier contributions, like Jirjahn and Stephan ([2006]) or Heinze and Wolf ([2010]), the unexplained gender pay gap is lower if {{some sort of}} worker codetermination is present. In the OLS {{specification}} (1), the gap amounts to 22.3 log points in codetermination-free plants but just 14.7 log points in plants with worker codetermination. As expected, in codetermined plants workers’ wages do not respond much to intensified competition. In the specifications with plant–sex or <b>match</b> <b>fixed</b> effects, an increase in competition causes male workers’ wages to fall by 0.7 – 0.8 log points, where the effect is statistically insignificant in the specification including <b>match</b> <b>fixed</b> effects. Furthermore, as the interaction effect is almost zero, there is clearly no differential effect across the sexes.|$|R

5|$|Serie A {{was dealt}} another blow by the 2006 Italian {{football}} scandal which involved alleged widespread <b>match</b> <b>fixing</b> implicating league champions Juventus, {{and other major}} teams including Milan, Fiorentina, Lazio, and Reggina.

The other clubs involved suffered similarly with relegation and points deduction.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} general {{administration}} of the sport, football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game, dealing with issues such as comments to the press, clubs' financial management, doping, age fraud and <b>match</b> <b>fixing.</b> Most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game. Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card. Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh.|$|E

Ganguly decided against retiring and attempted to make a comeback to the team. Ganguly was awarded the Padma Shri in 2004, India's fourth highest civilian award, in recognition of his distinguished contribution {{in the field of}} sports.

5|$|Monaco again {{finished}} third in 1989–90; striker Ramón Díaz scored 15 goals {{in his first season}} at the club. The club beat league winners Marseille in the Coupe de France final through a last minute goal from substitute Gérald Passi. In 1991–92, Monaco finished in second place and lost the 1992 European Cup Winners' Cup Final 2–0 to Werder Bremen. Although Monaco acquired the services of German striker Jürgen Klinsmann, the club could not regain the championship and concluded the subsequent seasons in third and ninth positions. Monaco did reach the semi-finals of the Champions League in April 1994, but lost to eventual winners Milan. As a result of his work at Monaco, Wenger was sought after by German club Bayern Munich, who wanted him to be their next manager. Monaco refused to let him leave and Wenger chose to stay, but a poor start to the 1994–95 season meant he was dismissed on 17 September 1994, with the team in 17th spot in the table. In 2001, Wenger said that the impact of bribery and corruption had influenced his decision to leave France, as Marseille were found guilty of <b>match</b> <b>fixing</b> in 1994.|$|E
5|$|The 2004–05 {{season was}} {{frustrating}} for the midfielder, who was sidelined {{for two months}} by knee and head injuries and first considered retirement in April 2005. Although Juventus won Serie A titles that year and in 2006, the titles were revoked after the Calciopoli <b>match</b> <b>fixing</b> scandal. After the 2005–06 season, which ended with Juventus' relegation from Serie A despite its first-place finish, many stars (such as Fabio Cannavaro and Lilian Thuram) left the club and the remaining players' future was uncertain. After the 2006 World Cup, Nedvěd dispelled rumours about his departure by reiterating his desire to help Juventus regain promotion to Serie A, citing {{his family and his}} commitment to the club as reasons for his decision. He received a five-match ban after a red card against Genoa in December 2006, and repeated his threat to retire. However, he remained with the club {{until the end of the}} season and scored 11 league goals in the 2006–07 Serie B.|$|E
5|$|The 1993–94 UEFA Champions League saw Linfield {{drawn with}} Dynamo Tbilisi of Georgia. After losing 3–2 on aggregate, they were {{reinstated}} when their opponents were {{expelled from the}} competition for alleged <b>match</b> <b>fixing</b> and paying the officials. Linfield faced Copenhagen {{in the first round}} proper. They won the first leg 3–0, but lost the second leg 4–0 after extra time. This proved costly, as victory would have meant a financially lucrative tie against eventual champions A.C. Milan in the next round. The club then had to wait seven years to participate in the competition again, due to the format of the two European competitions being altered. The league's relatively low ranking in the UEFA coefficient system has meant that the club has entered in the early qualifying rounds of either the UEFA Champions League or the UEFA Cup/Europa League, with the second qualifying round being the furthest the club has progressed in either competition. In the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League, the Blues entered the competition in the first qualifying round, and defeated B36 Tórshavn 4–3 on penalties to progress to the second qualifying round, after both legs ended as 0–0 draws. This was {{the first time since the}} 1984–85 season (excluding their opponent's expulsion in 1993–94) that the club had won a tie in the competition. However, they were defeated 3–0 on aggregate in the next round by AEL Limassol.|$|E
30|$|Using linked employer–employee panel {{data for}} West Germany {{for the years}} 2008 – 2010 that include a plant-level {{self-assessment}} on product market competition, we have investigated the effect of competition on the gender pay gap. In our preferred specification, we control for <b>match</b> <b>fixed</b> effects, thereby resting identification on the differential impact of within-plant variation in competitive pressure on within-plant wage growth of men and women. We thus address both unobserved time-invariant plant heterogeneity and worker self-selection into plants facing different levels of competition.|$|R
40|$|In recent work, Rosenbaum and Wagner {{showed that}} {{isomorphism}} of explicitly listed p-groups of order n could {{be tested in}} n^ 1 / 2 _p n + O(p) time, roughly a square root of the classical bound. The O(p) term is entirely due to an n^O(p) cost of testing for isomorphisms that <b>match</b> <b>fixed</b> composition series in the two groups. We focus here on the fixed-composition-series subproblem and exhibit a polynomial-time algorithm that is valid for general groups. A subsequent paper will construct canonical forms within the same time bound...|$|R
30|$|Against this background, {{our study}} {{contributes}} to the literature in three ways: First, our panel data permit us to investigate the impact of plant-level product market competition on the unexplained gender pay gap, controlling for <b>match</b> <b>fixed</b> effects, i.e., time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity for every plant–worker pair. We thus base our investigation on direct information on the competition faced by plants, with identification relying on the differential impact of within-plant variation in competitive pressure on within-plant wage growth of men and women. As a consequence, estimated effects are neither contaminated by unobserved time-invariant plant heterogeneity nor by self-selection of workers.|$|R

30|$|The picture hardly changes when resting {{identification}} on within-plant {{variation in}} competition in specifications (2) and (3). Intensified competition lowers male workers’ wages by 0.8 (0.9) log {{points in the}} specification with plant–sex (<b>match)</b> <b>fixed</b> effects, where the coefficient is statistically significant at the 5 (10) per cent level. Yet, the interaction effect of the female and the competition dummy is still very small and statistically insignificant throughout. So in the full sample, {{there is no indication}} of a differential short-run effect of intensified product market competition on female and male workers’ wages and thus no evidence of a (levelling) competition effect on gender wage discrimination.|$|R
40|$|A {{persistent}} and sizeable literature {{argues that the}} reported job dissatisfaction of union members is spurious. It reflects either the sorting of workers across union status or the sorting of union recognition across jobs. We cast doubt on this argument presenting the first estimates that use panel data to hold constant both worker and job <b>match</b> <b>fixed</b> effects. The estimates demonstrate that covered union members report greater dissatisfaction even when accounting for sorting in both dimensions. Moreover, covered union members {{are less likely to}} quit holding job satisfaction constant and their quit behaviour is far less responsive to job satisfaction. The paradox of the discontented union member remains intact. ...|$|R

However, the basis of the RPI, in measuring the price changes of a <b>matched,</b> <b>fixed</b> basket of goods, is considered inappropriate to modern markets. Some proposals are made. ...|$|R

25|$|Spot-fixing {{attempts}} to defraud bookmakers by a player taking a pre-arranged action {{to fix the}} result of that specific event. Spot-fixing differs from <b>match</b> <b>fixing,</b> in which the final result of a match is fixed; or point shaving, in which corrupt players (or officials) attempt to limit the margin of victory of the favoured team. Spot-fixing is more difficult to detect than <b>match</b> <b>fixing</b> or point shaving, and by its nature can be perpetrated by a lone fraudulent player without needing any other players or officials to co-operate. The growth of internet gambling and increased variety of betting options (e.g. spread betting, first-scorer betting) resulted in the emergence of spot-fixing, particularly through {{the first decade of the}} 2000s.|$|E

30|$|Using linked employer–employee panel {{data for}} West Germany that include direct {{information}} on the competition faced by plants, we investigate the effect of product market competition on the gender pay gap. Controlling for <b>match</b> <b>fixed</b> effects, we find that intensified competition significantly lowers the unexplained gap in plants with neither collective agreements nor a works council. Conversely, there is no effect in plants with these types of worker codetermination, which are unlikely to have enough discretion to adjust wages in the short run. We also document a larger competition effect in plants with few females in their workforces. Our findings {{are in line with}} Beckerian taste-based employer wage discrimination that is limited by competitive forces.|$|R
