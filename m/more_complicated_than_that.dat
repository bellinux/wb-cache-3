40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between net primary production (NPP) of Chinese fir, temperature and precipitation. The spatial-temporal NPP pattern in the potential distribution area of Chinese fir from 2000 - 2010 was estimated utilizing a MODIS MOD 17 product in a geographic information system (GIS) environment. The {{results showed that the}} highest NPP value of Chinese fir is in the Fujian province {{in the eastern part of}} the study region. The relationship between NPP of Chinese fir and climate variables was analyzed spatially and temporally. On the regional scale, precipitation showed higher correlation coefficients with NPP than did temperature. The spatial variability pattern indicated that temperature was more important in central and eastern regions (e. g. Hunan and Fujian province), while precipitation was crucial in the northern part (e. g. Anhui province). Zonal analysis revealed that the impact of precipitation on the production was <b>more</b> <b>complicate</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of temperature; larger amount of precipitation is not always corresponding with greater NPP value. When compared to natural forests, plantations appear to be more sensitive to the variability of precipitation, which indicates their higher vulnerability under climate change. Temporally, NPP values decreased despite of increasing temperatures, and the decrease was larger in plantations than among other vegetation types...|$|R

25|$|The {{structure}} of a noncommutative ring is <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of a commutative ring. For example, there exist simple rings, containing no non-trivial proper (two-sided) ideals, which contain non-trivial proper left or right ideals. Various invariants exist for commutative rings, whereas invariants of noncommutative rings are difficult to find. As an example, the nilradical of a ring, the set of all nilpotent elements, need not be an ideal unless the ring is commutative. Specifically, the set of all nilpotent elements in the ring of all n x n matrices over a division ring never forms an ideal, irrespective of the division ring chosen. There are, however, analogues of the nilradical defined for noncommutative rings, that coincide with the nilradical when commutativity is assumed.|$|E
