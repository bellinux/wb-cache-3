50|$|Microservices is {{a variant}} of the service-oriented {{architecture}} (SOA) architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.

It also parallelizes development by enabling small autonomous teams to develop, deploy and scale their respective services independently. It also allows the architecture of an individual service to emerge through continuous refactoring. Microservices-based architectures enable continuous delivery and deployment.|$|E

50|$|Islam {{has four}} sources for their ethical system, {{and these are}} the Quran, the sayings and {{behaviours}} of Prophet Mohammad, the example set by his companions, and the interpretations of Muslim scholars of these sources. These sources emphasize the importance of human well-being and good life, religious brotherhood and sisterhood, socioeconomic justice, and a balanced satisfaction of both the material and the spiritual. Islamic Marketing ethics aims at maximizing equity and justice for the welfare of the society. It does this by inhibiting customer exploitation, and avoiding dishonesty, fraud and deceit in business. Any unethical actions will do injustice and go against brotherhood and equality of humanity which form the core of Islamic vision. In today's society, business often relies on free market economy where firms experience the pressure of competition and seek profit maximization. This may lead to Islamic ethics being overlooked, which <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>application</b> of ihsan impossible.

5000|$|Connect serial-based {{applications}} with a COM/TTY port driver: Many {{software applications}} {{have been written}} to communicate with devices that are directly connected to a server's serial COM ports (robotic assembly machines, scanners, card readers, sensors, blood analyzers, etc.). Companies may want to network these applications because the devices that were directly connected to the server's COM ports need to be moved to a location some distance away from the application server. Since the original application was designed to talk directly to a specific COM port, a solution seamless to both the application and device must be implemented to enable communication across an IP network. (i.e., a solution that <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>application</b> think it is talking directly to a COM port.) In this application, serial ports can be connected to network servers or workstations running COM port redirector software operating as a virtual COM port. Many terminal server vendors include COM port redirector software with their terminal servers. This application need is most common in Windows environments, but also exists in Linux and Unix environments.|$|E

Koh first stated that [...] "U.S. targeting practices, including lethal operations conducted {{with the use of}} unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), comply with all applicable law, including the laws of war." [...] He further explained that the United States is in [...] "an armed conflict with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and the associated forces" [...] and thus has the lawful right to use force [...] "consistent with its inherent right to self-defense" [...] under international law in response to the 9/11 attacks. Under domestic law, he stated that targeted killings are authorized by the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). Although he contended that these international and domestic legal grounds [...] "continue to this day," [...] he also provided additional justification for current U.S. actions based on continued attacks and intent by al Qaeda. He concluded that the existence of this [...] "ongoing armed conflict" [...] grants legal authority to the United States to protect its citizens through the use of force, including lethal force, as a matter of self-defense. Koh then addressed specific legal reasoning and standards considered by the United States [...] "when defending itself against high-level leaders planning the attacks." [...] He reiterated the widely accepted conceptualization of an [...] "organized terrorist enemy" [...] as one that does not have conventional forces. Instead, such an enemy plans and executes its attacks while hiding among civilian populations, he said. As such, [...] "that behavior simultaneously <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>application</b> of international law more difficult and more critical for the protection of innocent civilians." [...] Koh identified three elements related to situational considerations that the United States uses when determining whether a specific targeted drone killing at a particular location will occur: ...|$|E
