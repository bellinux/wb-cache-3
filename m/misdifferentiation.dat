40|$|Proper {{control of}} {{adult stem cells}} {{including}} their proliferation and differentiation is crucial in maintaining homeostasis of well-organized tissues/organs throughout an organism's life. The Drosophila adult midgut has intestinal stem cells (ISCs), which have been exploited as a simple model system to investigate mechanisms controlling adult tissue homeostasis. Here, we found that a viable mutant of βν integrin (βint-ν), encoding one of two Drosophila integrin β subunits, showed a short midgut and abnormal multilayered epithelia accompanied {{by an increase in}} ISC proliferation and <b>misdifferentiation</b> defects. The increase in ISC proliferation and <b>misdifferentiation</b> was due to frequent ISC duplication expanding a pool of ISCs, which was caused by depression of the Notch signalling, and up-regulation of unpaired (upd), a gene encoding an extracellular ligand in the JAK/STAT signalling pathway. In addition, we observed that abnormally high accumulation of filamentous actin (F-actin) was caused in the βint-ν mutant enterocytes. Furthermore, the defects were rescued by suppressing c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling, which was up-regulated in a manner correlated with the defect levels in the above-mentioned βint-ν mutant phenotype. These symptoms observed in young βint-ν mutant midgut were very similar to those in the aged midgut in wild type. Our results suggested that βint-ν has a novel function for the Drosophila adult midgut homeostasis under normal conditions and provided a new insight into possible age-related diseases caused by latent abnormality of an integrin function...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in neurodevelopment {{is becoming increasingly}} clear. However, studies on HSPGs are hampered by pleiotropic effects when synthesis or modification of heparan sulfate itself is targeted, and by redundancy when the core proteins are altered. Gain-of-function experiments can sometimes circumvent these issues. Here we establish that transgenic mice overexpressing the HSPG agrin have severe ocular dysgenesis. The defects occur through a gain-of-function mechanism and penetrance is dependent on agrin dosage. The agrin-induced developmental defects are highly variable, and include anophthalmia, persistence of vitreous vessels, and fusion of anterior chamber structures. A frequently observed defect is an optic stalk coloboma leading to the <b>misdifferentiation</b> of the optic stalk as retina, which becomes continuous with the forebrain. The defects in optic-stalk differentiation correlate with reduced sonic hedgehog immunoreactivity and overexpansion of the PAX 6 domain from the retina into the optic stalk. The ocular phenotypes associated with agrin overexpression are dependent on genetic background, occurring with high penetrance in inbred C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. Distinct loci sensitizing C 57 BL/ 6 J mice to agrin-induced dysgenesis were identified. These results indicate that agrin overexpression will provide a tool to explore the molecular interactions of the extracellular matrix and cell surface in eye development, and provide a means for identifying modifier loci that sensitize mice to developmental eye defects...|$|E
40|$|Two {{dominant}} mouse skin mutants, Recombinant-induced mutation 3 (Rim 3) and Rex denuded (Re den), arose spontaneously {{in different}} inbred strains, but exhibit very similar phenotype of hyperkeratosis and alopecia. Both mutants have a genetic alteration in GasderminA- 3 (GsdmA- 3), {{which is a}} member of novel gene family, Gsdm. The Gsdm family commonly share unique leucine-rich C-terminus domain, but the functions of GsdmA- 3 and Gsdm family are largely unknown. 　　In this study, to elucidate the function of GsdmA- 3 in the epidermal morphogenesis, I conducted analysis of spatiotemporal expression patterns of GsdmA- 3 and the related genes. In addition, I carried out in-depth characterization of the Rim 3 phenotype. The results indicated that GsdmA- 3 is specifically expressed in differentiated keratinocytes in epidermis after postnatal stage, but not in proliferating epidermal cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of BrdU-labeled epidermis revealed hyperproliferation and <b>misdifferentiation</b> of the upper follicular cells and the epidermis in the Rim 3 mutant. All the results suggested that GsdmA- 3 is involved in downregulation of cellproliferation and differentiation of the epidermal stem cells. As collaboration with a research group of National Cancer Institute, Tokyo, it was demonstrated that a human homologue GSDMA has a tumor suppressor activity. Mice heterozygous for Trp 53 knockout (Trp 53 -) allele are known to frequently develop lymphomas, but never develop skin tumors. Although mice heterozygous for the Rim 3 mutation alone develop no skin tumors, I examined whether GsdmA- 3 is involved in tumor suppression in the Trp 53 - genetic background. To do this, I generated mice heterozygous for both of the Rim 3 and Trp 53 - alleles. As a result, the double heterozygous mice (GsdmA- 3 Rim 3 /+; Trp 53 + /+) developed multiple metastatic squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) as early as 7 months of the age. In conjunction with the data that a human homologue GSDMA is a tumor suppressor for gastric cancer in human, this result suggested that GsdmA- 3 has a function to prevent tumor development in the mouse skin as well...|$|E
40|$|The {{central nervous}} system {{consists}} of complex networks of neurons and other specialized cells that process information from {{within and outside the}} organism to create an output. The development of this complex machinery requires spatio-temporal regulation of neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation into the right type of cells at the right time. Deregulation of these developmental stages results in embryonic malformations or neurodevelopmental disorders. During development, the NSCs are instructed by their intrinsic gene regulatory network as well as the microenvironment which includes signaling molecules secreted by other cells, rigidity of the extracellular matrix, and cell-cell contact. The role of the metabolic signals in NSC differentiation is however less clear. The main aim of this thesis was to elucidate how microenvironmental metabolic cues are integrated into differentiation of embryonic neural stem cells focusing on developing spinal cord and cortex. Since vascularization is not complete during development cells are dependent on the oxygen and nutrients that diffuse through the tissue just like secreted signaling molecules. As a result each cell is exposed to varying levels of oxygen and glucose depending on their distance from the developing blood vessels and this leads to changes in the reduction-oxidation (redox) state of the cell. C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) is an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional co-repressor that can sense the redox changes and links the microenvironmental metabolic signals to the transcriptional regulation of cells. We found that the developing chick spinal cord displays an oxygen gradient throughout its dorsoventral axis, and CtBP is required to integrate the oxygen levels with local growth factor concentrations to regulate neurogenesis in the roof plate. Manipulation of the oxygen levels or downregulation of CtBP leads to <b>misdifferentiation</b> of neurons which demonstrates that the oxygen level is a required component of extracellular regulation of NSC differentiation. We further investigated the biochemical regulation of CtBP by metabolic changes. We showed that the acetylation and dimer detection of CtBP is regulated in inverse manner by oxygen levels in proliferative NSC. These post-translational regulation mechanisms may affect the transcriptional repressor activity of CtBP. The mammalian cortex contains six highly specialized layers that consist of several subtypes of neurons that form connections between the layers, different parts of the cortex and subcortical structures. These connections are important for information processing and input to output computation. Perturbations in this network lead to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. We found that NSC in the developing rodent cortex change their energy supply mechanisms as they differentiate, and manipulation of extracellular metabolic cues influences the gene expression of layer-specific neuronal markers. As we showed in the chick spinal cord, CtBP is the bridge between metabolism and differentiation also in the cortex. When CtBP is downregulated in developing mouse cortex the NSC pool is deregulated and cortical neuronal differentiation and migration is perturbed. Altogether these results demonstrate that metabolic cues in the neural stem cell microenvironment regulate neuronal differentiation in the developing spinal cord and cortex and that the metabolic changes are translated into cellular behavior via transcriptional co-repressor CtBP. Thus, controlled regulation of energy supply mechanisms is a required part of nervous system development...|$|E
