5|$|<b>Modern</b> cottage garden {{plants are}} {{typically}} flowers chosen for their old-fashioned and informal appeal. Many <b>modern</b> day gardeners use heirloom or 'old-fashioned' plants and varieties—even though these {{may not have}} been authentic or traditional cottage garden plants. In addition, there are <b>modern</b> varieties of flowers that fit into the cottage garden look. For example, <b>modern</b> roses developed by David Austin have been chosen for cottage gardens because of their old-fashioned look (multi-petaled form and rosette-shaped flowers) and fragrance—combined with <b>modern</b> virtues of hardiness, repeat blooming, and disease-resistance. <b>Modern</b> cottage gardens often use native plants and those adapted to the local climate, rather than trying to force traditional English plants to grow in an incompatible environment—though many of the old favorites thrive in cottage gardens throughout the world.|$|E

5|$|A {{haplotype}} is a {{group of}} genes found in an organism that are inherited together from one of their parents. A haplogroup {{is a group}} of similar haplotypes that share a single mutation inherited from their common ancestor. Mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) passes along the maternal line and can date back thousands of years. A 2005 study compared the mitochondrial DNA sequences of <b>modern</b> wolves with those from thirty-four specimens dated between 1856 and 1915. The historic population was found to possess twice the genetic diversity of <b>modern</b> wolves, which suggests that the mDNA diversity of the wolves eradicated from the western US was more than twice that of the <b>modern</b> population. A 2007 study compared mDNA sequences of <b>modern</b> wolves with those from Beringian wolves. The twenty Beringian wolves yielded sixteen haplotypes that could not be found in <b>modern</b> wolves, compared with seven haplotypes that were found in thirty-two <b>modern</b> Alaskan and Yukon wolves. This finding indicates that Beringian wolves were genetically distinct from <b>modern</b> wolves and possessed greater genetic diversity, and that there once existed in North America a larger wolf population than today.|$|E

As Johnson was a Loyalist during the American Revolution, he is {{believed}} to have taken his warrant with him when he fled to Canada, thus leaving the <b>Moderns</b> Lodges without a Provincial Grand Master.|$|R
50|$|After Dermott's death, the two Grand Lodges {{moved slowly}} towards union. The need for unity was {{underlined}} during the Napoleonic wars, when {{the leaders of}} the Ancients, <b>Moderns,</b> and the Grand Lodge of Scotland acted together to prevent their lodges becoming proscribed organisations. However, the actual process of unification did not start until 1811, when the <b>Moderns</b> started the administrative process of returning their ritual to a form acceptable to the other British Grand Lodges. The final union was in the hands of two sons of the King, the Duke of Sussex, the Grand Master of the <b>Moderns,</b> and the Duke of Kent. Kent had already effected a union in Canada by simply abolishing the <b>Moderns,</b> and merging their lodges with those of the Ancients. The new Grand Lodge, the United Grand Lodge of England, retained the infrastructure of the <b>Moderns,</b> and the ritual of the Ancients.|$|R

50|$|His long epic Clovis (1657) is {{noteworthy}} because Desmarets rejected the traditional pagan background, and maintained that Christian imagery should supplant it.

50|$|Two other {{distinguished}} 18th-century philosophers {{who wrote}} at length concerning {{the distinction between}} <b>moderns</b> and ancients are Giambattista Vico (cf. e.g. his De nostri temporis studiorum ratione) and Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (for whom the <b>moderns</b> see 'more,' but the ancients see 'better').|$|R

5|$|Bede's scriptural commentaries {{employed}} the allegorical {{method of interpretation}} and his history includes accounts of miracles, which to <b>modern</b> historians has seemed at odds with his critical approach to the materials in his history. <b>Modern</b> studies have shown the important role such concepts played in the world-view of Early Medieval scholars.|$|E
5|$|Biblical Hebrew {{after the}} Second Temple period evolved into Mishnaic Hebrew, which ceased being spoken and {{developed}} into a literary language around 200 CE. Hebrew continued {{to be used as}} a literary and liturgical language in the form of Medieval Hebrew, and Hebrew began a revival process in the 19th century, culminating in <b>Modern</b> Hebrew becoming the official language of Israel. Currently, Classical Hebrew is generally taught in public schools in Israel, and Biblical Hebrew forms are sometimes used in <b>Modern</b> Hebrew literature, much as archaic and biblical constructions are used in <b>Modern</b> English literature. Since <b>Modern</b> Hebrew contains many biblical elements, Biblical Hebrew is fairly intelligible to <b>Modern</b> Hebrew speakers.|$|E

5|$|Coins are {{the only}} items in the Hoxne Hoard for which a {{definite}} date and place of manufacture can be established. All of the gold coins, {{and many of the}} silver coins, bear the names and portraits of the emperor in whose reign they were minted. Most also retain the original mint marks that identify where they were minted, illustrating the Roman system of regional mints producing coins to a uniform design. The coins' manufacture has been traced back to a total of 14 sources: Trier, Arles and Lyon (in Gaul), Ravenna, Milan, Aquileia, Rome (in <b>modern</b> Italy); Siscia (<b>modern</b> Croatia), Sirmium (<b>modern</b> Serbia), Thessaloniki (Greece), Constantinople, Cyzicus, Nicomedia, and Antioch (<b>modern</b> Turkey).|$|E

50|$|In 1766, the <b>Moderns</b> {{who worked}} the Royal Arch degree formed a Grand Chapter with Lord Blayney at its head.

Although Dunckerley belonged to the <b>Moderns</b> Grand Lodge, he leaned towards the Antients in ritual, making him a natural ambassador for Royal Arch Masonry in his own Grand Lodge.

5|$|Early in {{this section}} Heilmann embarks on a {{thorough}} description of the Berlin Archaeopteryx specimen, which includes detailed comparisons to specific aspects of <b>modern</b> birds. Following a comparison of its skull to that of Aetosaurus, Euparkeria, and a <b>modern</b> pigeon, Heilmann states that he disagrees with the scientific consensus {{of the time that}} the skull of Archaeopteryx is that of a true bird. He writes that the reptilian features of the skull are much more pronounced, citing features of the teeth, fenestrae, and jaw structure as being undeniably un-birdlike. Heilmann found that much of Archaeopteryxs anatomy, in fact, was decidedly reptilian and generally opposed to that of <b>modern</b> birds. This included the pelvis, which lacks a pectineal process and has a very different os sacrum from <b>modern</b> birds, as well as the carpus, which Heilmann wrote exhibited the same phenomena found in the wrists of <b>modern</b> reptiles. Its tail was also noted by Heilmann as being extremely reptilian and resembling nothing known of <b>modern</b> birds.|$|E

5|$|Experts {{disagree}} {{over whether}} temnospondyls were ancestral to <b>modern</b> amphibians (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians), {{or whether the}} whole group died out without leaving any descendants. Different hypotheses have placed <b>modern</b> amphibians as the descendants of temnospondyls, another group of early tetrapods called lepospondyls, or even as descendants of both groups (with caecilians evolving from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolving from temnospondyls). Recent studies place a family of temnospondyls called the amphibamids as the closest relatives of <b>modern</b> amphibians. Similarities in teeth, skulls, and hearing structures link the two groups.|$|E
