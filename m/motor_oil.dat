5|$|Upon {{seeing the}} success of Wynn's Fire Chief, the Standard Oils in New Jersey, Louisiana and Pennsylvania, and Colonial Beacon, decided to sponsor their own radio program to promote Esso Gasoline and Essolube <b>Motor</b> <b>Oil.</b> They turned to the {{advertising}} agency McCann Erickson, which developed Five-Star Theater, a variety series that offered a different show each night of the week. Groucho and Chico Marx, {{one half of the}} popular vaudeville and film stars the Marx Brothers, were approached to appear in a comedy show. Harpo and Zeppo were not required, as their trademark shticks of mute and straight man did not work well on radio. Before this decision was officially reached, early drafts of the scripts featured guest appearances written for both absent brothers, with Harpo being represented through honks of his horn and other trademark sound effects.|$|E

Asphalt can also be made from waste material by fractional distillation of used <b>motor</b> <b>oil,</b> which is sometimes otherwise disposed of by burning or dumping into landfills.

Straight-weight non-detergent <b>motor</b> <b>oils</b> are usable, and in fact SAE 10 and 20 oils {{used to be the}} recommended spindle and way oils (respectively) on manual machine tools decades ago, although nowadays dedicated way oil formulas prevail in commercial machining. While nearly all <b>motor</b> <b>oils</b> can act as adequate cutting fluids in terms of their cutting performance alone, modern multi-weight <b>motor</b> <b>oils</b> with detergents and other additives are best avoided. These additives can present a copper-corrosion concern to brass and bronze, which machine tools often have in their bearings and leadscrew nuts (especially older or manual machine tools).|$|R

25|$|The Molotov {{cocktail}} is {{a generic}} name {{used for a}} variety of improvised incendiary weapons. Due to the relative ease of production, they are frequently used by amateur protesters and non-professionally equipped fighters in urban guerrilla warfares. They are primarily intended to set targets ablaze rather than instantly destroy them. A Molotov cocktail is a breakable glass bottle containing a flammable substance such as gasoline/petrol or a napalm-like mixture, with some <b>motor</b> <b>oil</b> added, and usually a source of ignition such as a burning cloth wick held in place by the bottle's stopper.

25|$|Water {{running off}} these {{impervious}} surfaces tends {{to pick up}} gasoline, <b>motor</b> <b>oil,</b> heavy metals, trash and other pollutants from roadways and parking lots, as well as fertilizers and pesticides from lawns. Roads and parking lots are major sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are created as combustion byproducts of gasoline and other fossil fuels, {{as well as of}} the heavy metals nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium, and lead. Roof runoff contributes high levels of synthetic organic compounds and zinc (from galvanized gutters). Fertilizer use on residential lawns, parks and golf courses is a measurable source of nitrates and phosphorus in urban runoff when fertilizer is improperly applied or when turf is over-fertilized.|$|E

25|$|Following the 2007 Daytona 500, {{the paint}} scheme of Kevin Harvick's winning No. 29 car infuriated NASCAR fuel {{supplier}} Sunoco, particularly the large Shell Oil logos {{on the car}} and team uniforms. Harvick had also worn his Shell firesuit during the Busch Series race he won the day before. Sunoco believed its exclusive rights to provide fuel to the sport also gave them exclusive marketing rights to gasoline, with other companies' limited to marketing secondary products such as <b>motor</b> <b>oil.</b> The 29 team altered its paint scheme the following week with smaller Shell decals, and larger emphasis of co-sponsor Pennzoil. It is to note that Sunoco sponsored Billy Hagan's race team from 1989 to 1992 with Sterling Marlin and Terry Labonte while Unocal 76 was the fuel supplier. Shell/Pennzoil remains in the sport with Team Penske's No. 22.|$|E
25|$|While {{the first}} Jupiter Fighter was {{evaluated}} at Martlesham Heath and found wanting, being lost on 23 November 1923 when the engine seized at high altitude, {{the second was}} sent to Sweden for evaluation, where it coped excellently with the extreme cold of the Swedish winter, with the Jupiter, using normal fuels and winter <b>motor</b> <b>oil,</b> operating without trouble in temperatures which normally caused engine oil to freeze in hours. The second Type 76 was therefore purchased by the Swedish Air Force, who operated it from May 1924 until 1935, when it was sold to a private buyer, finally being written off in 1936. The final Type 76 {{was used as a}} testbed for a high compression version of the Jupiter intended for use at high altitudes, which was fitted with a bi-fuel system to allow use of alcohol at low altitudes, then switching to normal petrol once the aircraft had reached sufficient altitude to prevent premature detonation (Engine knocking). This system was rejected in favour of supercharging.|$|E
25|$|Though NASCAR {{typically}} promotes {{competition between}} multiple brands, {{including those that}} sponsor the sport and individual races, the sanctioning body provides exclusive protection to its series title sponsors, such as Monster Energy in the Cup Series, as well as current fuel supplier Sunoco. This policy, known as the Viceroy rule, prevents sponsorship from direct competitors within a certain series, although it does not prevent a company from moving to a different series within the sport, or advertising a product that does not directly conflict with the title sponsor. For example, Royal Dutch Shell, Texaco and other oil companies {{have been allowed to}} promote their <b>motor</b> <b>oil</b> brands (Pennzoil and Havoline respectively) but not their gasoline products. When a new title sponsor creates conflicts with existing team sponsors, NASCAR typically allows the team sponsors to remain under a grandfather clause. The rule is named after the British cigarette brand Viceroy, and is in reference to the 1972 USAC Championship Car season during which title sponsor Marlboro renounced its branding when Viceroy entered the sport to sponsor entries.|$|E

In one vein, I have Disney blood, and in the other, there's <b>motor</b> <b>oil.</b> The notion of combining these two great passions in my lifeâ€”cars and animationâ€”was irresistible. When Joe (Ranft) and I first started talking about this film in 1998, we knew we wanted to do something with cars as characters. Around that same time, we watched a documentary called 'Divided Highways,' which dealt with the interstate highway and how it affected the small towns along the way. We were so moved by it and began thinking about what it must have been like in these small towns that got bypassed. That's when we started really researching Route 66, but we still hadn't quite figured out what the story for the film was going to be. I used to travel that highway with my family as a child when we visited our family in St. Louis." ...|$|E
500|$|Many breeders take {{a variety}} of {{preventive}} measures to ward off problems. The first is to ensure all sheep are healthy when purchased. Many buyers avoid outlets known to be clearing houses for animals culled from healthy flocks as either sick or simply inferior. This can also mean maintaining a closed flock, and quarantining new sheep for a month. Two fundamental preventive programs are maintaining good nutrition and reducing stress in the sheep. Restraint, isolation, loud noises, novel situations, pain, heat, extreme cold, fatigue and other stressors can lead to secretion of cortisol, a stress hormone, in amounts that may indicate welfare problems. [...] Excessive stress can compromise the immune system. [...] "Shipping fever" [...] (pneumonic mannheimiosis, formerly called pasteurellosis) is a disease of particular concern, that can occur {{as a result of}} stress, notably during transport and (or) handling. [...] Pain, fear and several other stressors can cause secretion of epinephrine (adrenaline). [...] Considerable epinephrine secretion in the final days before slaughter can adversely affect meat quality (by causing glycogenolysis, removing the substrate for normal post-slaughter acidification of meat) and result in meat becoming more susceptible to colonization by spoilage bacteria. [...] Because of such issues, low-stress handling is essential in sheep management. [...] Avoiding poisoning is also important; common poisons are pesticide sprays, inorganic fertilizer, <b>motor</b> <b>oil,</b> as well as radiator coolant containing ethylene glycol.|$|E
