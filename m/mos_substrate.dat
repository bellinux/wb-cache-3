40|$|Abstract Background The mos {{proto-oncogene}} encodes a cytoplasmic serine/threonine-specific {{protein kinase}} with crucial function during meiotic cell division in vertebrates. Based on oncogenic amino acid substitutions the viral derivative, 124 -v-Mos, displays constitutive protein kinase activity and functions independent of unknown upstream effectors of mos protein kinase. We have utilized this property of 124 -v-Mos and screened for novel <b>mos</b> <b>substrates</b> in immunocomplex kinase assays in vitro. Results We generated recombinant 124 -v-Mos using the baculovirus expression system in Spodoptera frugiperda cells and demonstrated constitutive kinase activity by {{the ability of}} 124 -v-Mos to auto-phosphorylate and to phosphorylate vimentin, a known substrate of c-Mos. Using this approach we analyzed a panel of acidic and basic substrates in immunocomplex protein kinase assays and identified novel in vitro substrates for 124 -v-Mos, the protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 B (PTP 1 B), alpha-casein and beta-casein. We controlled mos-specific phosphorylation of PTP 1 B and casein in comparative assays using a synthetic kinase-inactive 124 -v-Mos mutant and further, tryptic digests of mos-phosphorylated beta-casein identified a phosphopeptide specifically targeted by wild-type 124 -v-Mos. Two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analyses showed that 124 -v-mos targets serine and threonine residues for phosphorylation in casein at a 1 : 1 ratio but auto-phosphorylation occurs predominantly on serine residues. Conclusion The <b>mos</b> <b>substrates</b> identified in this study represent a basis to approach {{the identification of the}} mos-consensus phosphorylation motif, important for the development of specific inhibitors of the Mos protein kinase. </p...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{enduring}} challenges in graphene research and applications is the extreme sensitivity of its charge carriers to external perturbations, especially those {{introduced by the}} substrate. The best available substrates to date, graphite and hBN, still pose limitations: graphite being metallic does not allow gating, while both hBN and graphite having lattice structures closely matched to that of graphene, may cause significant band structure reconstruction. Here we show that the atomically smooth surface of exfoliated MoS 2 provides access to the intrinsic electronic structure of graphene without these drawbacks. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and Landau-level spectroscopy in a device configuration which allows tuning the carrier concentration, we find that graphene on MoS 2 is ultra-flat producing long mean free paths, while avoiding band structure reconstruction. Importantly, the screening of the <b>MoS</b> 2 <b>substrate</b> can be tuned by changing {{the position of the}} Fermi energy with relatively low gate voltages.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} MEDICI {{simulations}} of the admittance-voltage properties of Ge and Si MOS devices, including analyses of substrate conductance Gsub and high–low transition frequency ftran, {{to explore the}} differences in the minority-carrier response. The Arrhenius-dependent Gsub char-acteristics revealed that a larger energy loss—by at least four orders of magnitude—occurs in Ge than in Si, reflecting the fast minority-carrier response rate, i. e., a higher value of ftran. We confirmed that the higher intrinsic carrier concentration in Ge, through the generation/recombination of midgap trap levels as well as the diffusion mechanism, resulted in the onset of low-frequency C–V curves in the kilohertz regime, accompanying the gate-independent inversion conductance. The experimental data obtained from Al 2 O 3 /Ge MOS capacitors were consistent with the values of Gsub and ftran obtained from MEDICI predic-tions and theoretical calculations. In addition, upon increasing the inversion biases, we observed shifts in the Gsub/f con-ductance peaks to low frequencies that mainly arose from the transition of minority carriers with bulk traps in the depletion layer.

Incubations with Suc only, acting as both donor and acceptor, resulted in elongation of Suc with glucose (Glc) units via alternating (alpha 1 -> 4) and (alpha 1 -> 6) linkages, yielding linear gluco-oligosaccharides up to at least DP similar to 12. Simultaneously with the ensemble of oligosaccharides, polymeric material was formed early on, suggesting that alternan fragments longer than DP similar to 12 have higher affinity with the GTFA enzyme and are quickly extended, yielding high-molecular-mass branched reuteran (4 x 10 (7) Da).

As the experimental research on dysprosium compounds is scarce, the possible applications of these could be many. Depending on the stoichiometry of the compound, it may contribute in fields such as spintronics, magneto-optics or as a semiconducting material. Preliminary studies to introduce dysprosium as a magnetic dopant in the van der Waals gaps of the molybdenum disulphide bilayer structure revealed an interesting chemical reaction between the two compounds. As this was worth further investigation, the interplay between MoS 2 and the f-block element, dysprosium, has been investigated in situ by the means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), {{low energy electron diffraction}} (LEED) and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Results indicate the formation of dysprosium sulphide thin films by sulphur extraction from the MoS 2 when annealing the samples to 300 °C. For sufficiently thin samples in the range of 2 - 3 monolayers this reaction is observed to occur even at room temperature, and further propagated by heating. Using a finite element model, the layered stoichiometry of the dysprosium sulphide was extracted. In combination with the observed diffraction patterns from LEED, this supports the formation of a possible mono- or disulphide, differing from the most stable bulk formation of Dy 2 S 3. Studying the electronic structure by ARPES showed a decrease of the valence band maximum of MoS 2 at the M -point by 130 meV.

At room temperature and low deposition rates we have found compelling evidence that the deposited Si atoms intercalate between the MoS 2 layers. Our evidence relies on several experimental observations: (1) Upon the deposition of Si on pristine MoS 2 the morphology of the surface transforms from a smooth surface to a hill-and-valley surface. The lattice constant of the hill-and-valley structure amounts to 3. 16 Å, which is exactly the lattice constant of pristine MoS 2. (2) The transitions from hills to valleys are not abrupt, as one would expect for epitaxial islands growing on-top of a substrate, but very gradual. (3) I (V) scanning tunneling spectroscopy spectra recorded at the hills and valleys reveal no noteworthy differences. (4) Spatial maps of d I/ d z reveal that the surface exhibits a uniform work function and a lattice constant of 3. 16 Å. (5) X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy measurements reveal that sputtering of the <b>MoS</b> 2 /Si <b>substrate</b> does not lead to a decrease, but an increase of the relative Si signal.

Cluster-based thin films are formed either from clusters deposited directly onto a substrate in a vacuum chamber or from clusters stabilized as colloidal particles in an organic solvent and cast onto the substrate. Colloidal stabilization is achieved by the formation of a self-assembled monolayer of alkanethiol surfactant molecules on the surface of each cluster produced in the MECS. ^ Vacuum deposition of bare metal clusters is investigated as an alternative technique {{for producing}} metal interconnect lines. The film growth process and the electrical transport properties of such cluster-based metal interconnects is compared with those of conventional atomically deposited interconnects. The resistance of cluster-based interconnects to electromigration damage at high current densities is also investigated and is found to be superior to that of atomically deposited interconnects. ^ Casting of colloidal metal clusters onto a flat substrate is investigated as a way of producing novel thin films that conduct electricity by single electron tunneling. When cast on a flat <b>substrate</b> (<b>MoS</b> 2, HOPG, SiO 2), the nanometer size clusters group to form close-packed monolayer arrays. The effects of substrate material, colloid concentration, and chemical annealing on the quality of these arrays is studied. Electronically-linked networks of gold clusters are synthesized, and initial measurements of their electrical conductivity are made. ...|$|R

For two alternating orientations of the adsorbed dipoles or dipoles and alkyl chains, bi-stability of anchoring can be obtained. The results are explained using the introduction of fourth order terms in the phenomenological anchoring potential, leading to the demonstration of first order anchoring transition in these systems. Using this phenomenological anchoring potential, we finally show how the nature of anchoring in presence of dual easy axes (inducing bi-stability or average orientation between the two easy axes) can be related to the microscopical nature of the interface. Introduction Understanding the interactions between liquid crystal (LC) and a solid substrate is of clear applied interest, the vast majority of LC displays relying on control of interfaces. However this concerns also fundamental problems like wetting phenomena and all phenomena of orientation of soft matter bulk induced by the presence of an interface. In LCs at interfaces, the so-called easy axes correspond to the favoured orientations of the LC director close to the interface. If one easy axis only is defined for one given interface, the bulk director orients along or close to this axis [1]. It is well known that, in anchoring phenomena, two major effects compete to impose the anchoring directions of a liquid crystal, first, the interactions between molecules and the interface, second, the substrate roughness whose role has been analyzed by Berreman [2]. The influence of adsorbed molecular functional groups at the interface is most often dominant with, for example in carbon substrates, a main influence of unsaturated carbon bonds orientation at the interface [3]. In common LC displays, there is one unique easy axis, but modifications of surfaces have allowed for the discovery of promising new anchoring-related properties. For instance, the first anchoring bi-stability has been established on rough surfaces, associated with electric ordo-polarization [4] and the competition between a stabilizing short-range term and a destabilizing long-range term induced by an external field, can induce a continuous variation of anchoring orientation [5]. More recently, surfaces with several easy axes have been studied extensively. It has been shown that control of a continuous variation of director pretilt, obtained in several systems [6, 7], is associated with the presence of two different easy axes, one perpendicular to the substrate (homeotropic) and one planar [7, 8]. Similar models can explain the continuous evolution of anchoring between two planar orientations observed on some crystalline substrates [9]. However, in the same time, two easy axes can also lead to anchoring bi-stability [10, 11] or discontinuous transitions of anchoring [9], which is not compatible with the model established to interpret observed control of pretilt. In {{order to be able to}} predict if bi-stability or continuous combination of the two easy axes occurs for one given system, it becomes necessary to understand the microscopic origin of the easy axes...|$|R
