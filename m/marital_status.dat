5|$|In 1843 Hogg {{became the}} target of a {{blackmail}} attempt by John Edward Johnson, Jane's husband. Johnson provided journalist Barnard Gregory with the details of Jane's <b>marital</b> <b>status.</b> Gregory soon published a report on her in The Satirist, but made a crucial mistake. Gregory claimed that the wife of James Hogg, a Member of Parliament for Beverly, was legally married to another man, prompting James Hogg to initiate a libel suit against Gregory. Johnson quickly disappeared after he learned of the error. Gregory was convicted of libel and served a brief prison sentence. Following his release he prepared a correction that he intended for publication, which could have threatened Hogg's legal position. Hogg appealed to Leigh Hunt, who convinced Gregory not to publish. John Edward Johnson died in 1840, ensuring that Jane would never be blackmailed because of her <b>marital</b> <b>status.</b> Although Hogg and Jane were now free to marry they chose not to, to avoid revealing their situation.|$|E
5|$|Being a {{foreigner}} {{and possibly a}} hetaera, Aspasia was free of the legal restraints that traditionally confined married women to their homes, and thereby was allowed {{to participate in the}} public life of the city. She became the mistress of the statesman Pericles in the early 440s. After he divorced his first wife (c. 445 BC), Aspasia began to live with him, although her <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> remains disputed. Their son, Pericles the Younger, must have been born by 440 BC. Aspasia would have to have been quite young, if she were able to bear a child to Lysicles c. 428 BC.|$|E

Motherhood does not affect perceived stress among married or cohabitating women but single and postmarried mothers endure appreciably higher levels of stress. Interactions between working and parental or <b>marital</b> <b>statuses</b> are also observed. The sense of community belonging appears as an important coping mechanism lowering stress levels.

Based on the output of the analysis it can be inferred that there are remarkable differences especially across religious denominations and world regions where the most notable differences are found in case of relative income, unemployment, gender and <b>marital</b> <b>statuses.</b> On the other hand, the differences across various municipality sizes are not so frequent or substantial and the most significant variations are found for variables representing GDP per capita and <b>marital</b> <b>statuses.</b> Key Words subjective well-being, determinants of happiness, religious denominations, world regions, municipality sizes, comparison, difference...|$|R

Despite the fact that married women were not generally welcome on university faculties (female professors were usually expected to resign when they married), Stieglitz agreed to write a recommendation letter for Morgan for a position at the University of Illinois. Stieglitz noted in his letter that the university should overlook Morgan's <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> because her husband was ill at the time.|$|E
5|$|In {{most current}} cultures, {{it is more}} typical for women to wear long hair than for men to do so. An American study shows {{significant}} correlation between hair length and age, which indicates that younger women tend to have longer hair than older women. A significant correlation was also found between women's hair length and hair quality. Moreover, hair quality was correlated with the women's perceived physical health. Consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology, {{these results indicate that}} hair length and quality can act as a cue to a woman's youth and health, signifying reproductive potential. The correlation between the woman's hair length and <b>marital</b> <b>status,</b> or number of children, was however not more than to be expected from the correlation between hair length and age.|$|E

5|$|The Australian War Cabinet {{approved}} the Department of Post-War Reconstruction's proposed principles to govern demobilisation on 12June 1944. The {{key element of}} these principles was that {{the order in which}} personnel would be demobilised was to be based on a points system, with service men and women being allocated points {{on the basis of their}} period of service, age, <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> and employment or training prospects. An extensive demobilisation plan was then developed by an inter-service committee following further consultation with trade unions, employers and returned servicemen. This plan was accepted as the basis for planning by the War Cabinet on 6March 1945. The rate at which personnel were to be discharged was set at 3,000 a day for six days a week and was to be capable of being increased in the event of an emergency.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{contrasting}} views {{regarding the}} <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> of Tulsidas. According to the Mula Gosain Charita {{and some other}} works, Tulsidas was married to Ratnavali on the thirteenth day of the bright half of the Jyeshta month (May–June) in Vikram 1583 (1526 CE). Ratnavali {{was the daughter of}} Dinbandhu Pathak, a Brahmin of the Bharadwaja Gotra, who belonged to Mahewa village of Kaushambi district. They had a son named Tarak who died as a toddler. Once when Tulsidas had gone to a Hanuman temple, Ratnavali went to her father's home with her brother. When Tulsidas came to know this, he swam across the Yamuna river in the night to meet his wife. Ratnavali chided Tulsidas for this, and remarked that if Tulsidas was even half as devoted to God as he was to her body of flesh and blood, he would have been redeemed. Tulsidas left her instantly and left for the holy city of Prayag. Here, he renounced the Grihastha (householder's life) stage and became a Sadhu (Hindu ascetic).|$|E

5|$|On 5 May 2016, James Reilly, then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, {{announced}} that the Irish Government had approved {{the publication of the}} Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2016. The bill would amend the Adoption Act 2010 and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 and give legislative effect to the Thirty-first Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland (the children referendum). The purposes of the bill are to allow children to be adopted by their foster carers, where they have cared for the child for at least 18 months, and to allow two people regardless of <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> to adopt children, thus granting married same-sex couples the right to adopt. The bill also allows for the adoption of a child by civil partners and cohabiting couples and gives children a greater say in the adoption process, among many other reforms to the adoption system. The bill passed the Dáil on 30 November 2016, and received approval by the Seanad on 13 June 2017. The bill was signed into law by President Michael D. Higgins on 19 July 2017, becoming the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017. The commencement order was signed by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Katherine Zappone, on 18 October and the law went into effect the following day.|$|E

These exercises serve the purpose of both illustrating the heterogeneous effects within subsamples of the data and corroborating the identification of the key coefficients in {{the benchmark}} specification. For example, the sector experience is correlated by construction with our measure of technical change and may affect the early retirement decision directly through higher pension entitlements, wage profiles, and so on. Hence, it is important to see how our key coefficients describe the same nonlinear relationship between technical change and early retirement for both high and low levels of sector experience.|$|R
