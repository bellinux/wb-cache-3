40|$|Since {{the early}} 1960 's, {{virtually}} all NASA spacecraft have used metallized films {{for a variety}} of purposes, principally thermal radiation insulation. King Seeley manufactures a broad line of industrial and consumer oriented <b>metallized</b> film, fabric, <b>paper</b> and foam in single layer sheets and multi-layer laminates. A few examples, commercialized by MPI Outdoor Safety Products, are the three ounce Thermos Emergency Blanket which reflects and retains up to 80 percent of the user's body heat helping prevent post accident shock or keeping a person warm for hours under emergency cold weather conditions...|$|R
25|$|However, the {{roughness}} of a <b>metallized</b> <b>paper</b> surface can cause many small air-filled bubbles between the dielectric and the metallization, decreasing the breakdown voltage of the capacitor. For this reason, larger film capacitors or power capacitors using paper as carrier of the electrodes usually {{are filled with}} an insulating oil or gas, to displace the air bubbles for a higher breakdown voltage.|$|E
25|$|Film power {{capacitors}} mostly use {{polypropylene film}} as the dielectric. Other types include <b>metallized</b> <b>paper</b> capacitors (MP capacitors) and mixed dielectric film capacitors with polypropylene dielectrics. MP capacitors serve for cost applications and as field-free carrier electrodes (soggy foil capacitors) for high AC or high current pulse loads. Windings can {{be filled with}} an insulating oil or with epoxy resin to reduce air bubbles, thereby preventing short circuits.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the great}} {{advantages}} of plastic films for capacitor fabrication is that plastic films have considerably fewer defects than paper sheets used in paper capacitors. This allows the manufacture of plastic film capacitors with only a single layer of plastic film, whereas paper capacitors need a double layer of paper. Plastic film capacitors were significantly smaller in physical size (better volumetric efficiency), with the same capacitance value and the same dielectric strength as comparable paper capacitors. Then-new plastic materials also showed further advantages compared with paper. Plastic is much less hygroscopic than paper, reducing the deleterious effects of imperfect sealing. Additionally, most plastics are subject to fewer chemical changes over long periods, providing long-term stability of their electrical parameters. Since around 1980, paper and <b>metallized</b> <b>paper</b> capacitors (MP capacitors) have almost completely been replaced by PET film capacitors for most low-power DC electronic applications. Paper is now used only in RFI suppression or motor run capacitors, or as a mixed dielectric combined with polypropylene films in large AC and DC capacitors for high-power applications.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} a sensor for detecting {{the distribution of}} forces on a surface. The device with nine buttons consisted of an elastomer-based layer as a touch interface resting on a substrate of patterned <b>metallized</b> <b>paper.</b> The elastomer-based layer included a three-by-three array of deformable, hemispherical elements/reliefs, facing down toward an array of interdigitated capacitive sensing units on patterned <b>metallized</b> <b>paper.</b> Each hemispherical element is 20 mm in diameter and 8 mm in height. When a user applied pressure to the elastomer-based layer, the contact area between the hemispherical elements and the interdigitated capacitive sensing units increased with the deformation of the hemispherical elements. To enhance {{the sensitivity of the}} sensors, embedded particles of hydrogel in the elastomer-based layer increased the measured electrical responses. The measured capacitance increased because the effective dielectric permittivity of the hydrogel was greater than that of air. Electromechanical characterization verified that the hydrogel-filled elastomer was more sensitive to force at a low range of loads (23. 4 pF/N) than elastomer alone without embedded hydrogel (3. 4 pF/N), as the hydrogel reduced the effective elastic modulus of the composite material by a factor of seven. A simple demonstration suggests that the force-sensing array has the potential to contribute to wearable and soft robotic devices...|$|E
