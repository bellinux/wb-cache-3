The optimized section is transformed into the three-dimensional propeller flow using the approach of the effective <b>blade</b> <b>sections.</b> Effective <b>blade</b> <b>sections</b> are two-dimensional sections in two-dimensional flow which have the same chordwise loading distribution as the three-dimensional <b>blade</b> <b>sections</b> of a propeller. However, the design procedure is laborious in two aspects: finding an optimum <b>blade</b> <b>section</b> using the Eppler program requires much skill of the designer, and transforming the two-dimensional <b>blade</b> <b>section</b> into a propeller <b>blade</b> <b>section</b> in three-dimensional flow is complex. In this paper, these two problems are dealt with. A <b>blade</b> <b>section</b> design procedure is presented using an optimization technique and an alternative procedure for the effective <b>blade</b> <b>section</b> is developed using a lifting surface design method. To validate the method a benchmark model of a naval ship was used. This benchmark model was extended by new appendices and a reference propeller, designed using conventional design methods. This reference propeller was optimized using the new design procedure and model tests were carried out Special attention was given to the data of the model and the reference propeller, to make the configuration suitable for RANS calculations...|$|R

40|$|A {{morphing}} {{trailing edge}} flap system for wind turbine blades The development of a morphing trailing edge system for wind turbines, also called a flap system, is presented. The functionality is simple as the flap deflection is controlled by pressurized air or a fluid {{in a number of}} voids in the flap made of an elastic material. It is thus a robust system as no mechanical or metal parts are used. The prototypes tested in the laboratory and on a <b>blade</b> <b>section</b> in a wind tunnel in the period from 2007 - 2010 demonstrated the functionality and the aerodynamic performance of the flap concept. In a recent research and development project INDUFLAP from 2011 - 2014 the flap system has been further developed in corporation with the industrial partners Hydratech Industries (DK) and Rehau (DE). A new {{trailing edge flap}} design with spanwise voids (channels) and with a chord of 15 cm suitable for a 1 m chord <b>blade</b> <b>section</b> was developed. It was then manufactured by extrusion and glued together with a load carrying part with a connector part that allows an easy attachment on the <b>blade</b> <b>section.</b> After tests in the laboratory the flap was mounted on a 2 m long <b>blade</b> <b>section</b> mounted on a newly developed test rig.

The analysis is reduced to integrated normal force and moment coefficients. Considering that the NREL phase VI blade uses exclusively the S 809 aerofoil on its sections, experimen-tal sinusoidal oscillating tests of the 2 D S 809 profile {{have been used as}} baseline. First, the unsteady cases of the 2 D aerofoil are compared with the unsteady results of the 3 D parked <b>blade</b> <b>sections,</b> both experimental data undergoing the same pitching oscillations.

This has resulted in further changes in propeller design characteristics including increased skew, tip unloading and introduction of “New Blade Sections” (NBS) designed {{on the basis of the}} so-called Eppler code. An experimental study was carried out to investigate flow characteristics of alternative two-dimensional (2 -D) <b>blade</b> <b>sections</b> of rectangular planform, one of which was the New <b>Blade</b> <b>Section</b> (NBS) developed in Newcastle University and other was based on the well-known National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) section. The experiments comprised the cavitation observations and the measurements of the local velocity distribution around the <b>blade</b> <b>sections</b> by using a 2 -D Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) system. Analysis of the cavitation tests demonstrated that the two <b>blade</b> <b>sections</b> presented very similar bucket shapes with virtually no width at the bottom but relatively favourable buckets arms at the suction and pressure sides for the NACA section. Similarly, pressure analysis of the sections displayed a slightly larger value for the NBS pressure peak. The comparative overall pressure distributions around the sections suggested that the NBS might be more susceptible to cavitation than the NACA section. This can be closely related to the fundamental shape of the NBS with very fine leading edge. Therefore a further investigation into the modification of the leading edge should be considered to improve the cavitation behaviour of the NBS...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} bend–twist {{coupling}} on the aeroelastic modal properties and stability limits of a two-dimensional <b>blade</b> <b>section</b> in attached flow are investigated. Bend–twist coupling is {{introduced in the}} stiffness matrix of the structural <b>blade</b> <b>section</b> model. The structural model is coupled with an unsteady aerodynamic model in a linearised state–space formulation. A numerical study is performed using structural and aerodynamic parameters representative for wind turbine blades. It is shown that damping of the edgewise mode is primarily influenced {{by the work of}} the lift which is close to antiphase, making the stability of the mode sensitive to changes in the stiffness matrix. The aerodynamic forces increase the stiffness of the flapwise mode for flap–twist coupling to feather for downwind deflections. The stiffness reduces and damping increases for flap–twist to stall. Edge–twist coupling is prone to an edgetwist flutter instability at much lower inflow speeds than the uncoupled <b>blade</b> <b>section.</b> Flap–twist coupling results in a moderate reduction of the flutter speed for twist to feather and divergence for twist to stall...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study was}} conducted to predict the effect of an oscillating stream on the time dependent sectional pressure and lift coefficients of a model propeller blade. The assumption is that as the <b>blade</b> <b>sections</b> encounter a wake, the actual angles of attack vary in a sinusoidal manner through the wake, thus each blade is exposed to an unsteady stream oscillating about a mean value at a certain reduced frequency. On the other hand, an isolated propeller at some angle of attack can experience periodic changes {{in the value of the}} flow angle causing unsteady loads on the blades. Such a flow condition requires the inclusion of new expressions in the formulation of the unsteady potential flow around the <b>blade</b> <b>sections.</b> These expressions account for time variation of angle of attack and total shed vortices in the wake of each airfoil section.
