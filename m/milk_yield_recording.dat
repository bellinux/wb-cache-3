Many Precision Dairy Farming technologies, including daily <b>milk</b> <b>yield</b> <b>recording,</b> milk component monitoring, pedometers, automatic temperature recording devices, milk conductivity indicators, automatic estrus detection monitors, and daily body weight measurements, are already being utilized by dairy producers. 	Other theoretical Precision Dairy Farming technologies have been proposed to measure jaw movements, ruminal pH, reticular contractions, heart rate, animal positioning and activity, vaginal mucus electrical resistance, feeding behavior, lying behavior, odor, glucose, acoustics, progesterone, individual milk components, color (as an indicator of cleanliness), infrared udder surface temperatures, and respiration rates. 	The main objectives of Precision Dairy Farming are maximizing individual animal potential, early detection of disease, and minimizing the use of medication through preventive health measures. 	Perceived benefits of Precision Dairy Farming technologies include increased efficiency, reduced costs, improved product quality, minimized adverse environmental impacts, and improved animal health and well-being. 	Real time data used for monitoring animals may be incorporated into decision support systems designed to facilitate decision making for issues that require compilation of multiple sources of data. 	Technologies for physiological monitoring of dairy cows have great potential to supplement the observational activities of skilled herdspersons, which is especially critical as more cows are managed by fewer skilled workers. 	The economic implications of technology adoption must be explored further to increase adoption rates of Precision Dairy Farming technologies...|$|E

A new milk urea model {{to indicate the}} dietary crude protein / energy balance in dairy cows The object {{of this study was}} to determine the impact of dietary crude protein / energy balance, stage of lactation, parity, milk protein yield, somatic cell count on milk urea concentration under the conditions of routine <b>milk</b> <b>yield</b> <b>recording.</b> From this data a model was created to predict the milk urea concentration for a single dairy cow or a feeding group. The relationship between dietary crude protein/energy balance, milk protein yield, stage of lactation, somatic cell count and milk urea concentration can be described by the following equation: first lactation period y = 156. 7 + 42. 52 * milk protein yield + 0. 34 * day in milk - 0. 017 * somatic cell count second lactation period y = 186. 2 + 43. 23 * milk protein yield + 0. 04 * day in milk - 0. 019 * somatic cell count third lactation period y = 188. 3 + 31. 17 * milk protein yield + 0. 06 * day in milk - 0. 015 * somatic cell count The approximate confidence interval for a predicted milk urea content is ± 15 mg/l. If the analyzed milk urea concentration is greater than the predicted milk urea content (interval), this could indicate dietary crude protein excess.

Lactation <b>milk</b> <b>yield</b> averaged 1475 ± 651 kg for an average lactation length of 248 ± 67 days (n= 2039). Year of calving and season of calving both significantly (P< 0. 01) affected <b>milk</b> <b>yield</b> and lactation length. Age within parity also significantly affected the two traits. Winter calvers produced more milk (1546 kg) as compared to summer calvers (1362 kg). <b>Milk</b> <b>yield</b> gradually increased towards 4 th and 5 th parity and declined thereafter, while highest lactation length (263 days) was observed for first parity cows. The repeatability estimates for lactation length and <b>milk</b> <b>yield</b> were 0. 326 ± 0. 025 and 0. 46 ± 0. 041, respectively. When <b>milk</b> <b>yield</b> was adjusted for lactation length by different procedures, all the variation in <b>milk</b> <b>yield</b> due to lactation length could not be removed (weeks in milk effect remained significant).

In this experiment a balanced change-over design with four treatments and four periods with 21 days were employed. Treatments included: (1) Control (without PG), (2) 250 g PG/cow/day, (3) 500 g PG/cow/day and (4) 750 g PG/cow/day. Daily <b>milk</b> <b>yield</b> <b>recorded</b> and <b>milk</b> samples were taken during seven and two last days of each period. The results show that dry matter intake, <b>milk</b> <b>yield,</b> fat corrected <b>milk</b> <b>yield,</b> <b>milk</b> compositions were not affected (p> 0. 05) by different levels of PG.

Several studies have been pub-lished concerning the amount and importance of the accuracy lost when this interval is lengthened. At least seven investigators have reported the accuracy of lactation records computed from monthly butterfat tests and milk weights as compared with an accuracy from daily measures (2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12).

40|$|Daily <b>milk</b> <b>yields</b> on test {{days were}} {{estimated}} using morning or afternoon partial <b>milk</b> <b>yields</b> collected by official {{agencies and the}} accuracy of the estimates was determined. Test-day data for <b>milk</b> <b>yields</b> consisted of 3, 156, 734 records of AM/PM partial milking measurements of 255, 437 milking Holstein cows from 3, 708 farms collected from December 2008 to April 2013. A linear regression model (LRM) was applied to estimate daily <b>milk</b> <b>yields</b> using alternate AM/PM <b>milk</b> <b>yield</b> <b>records</b> within lactation stages, milking intervals, and parities on every daily <b>milk</b> <b>yield.</b> The alternate statistical approach was a non-linear hierarchical model (NHM) in which Brody’s growth function was implemented by reflecting an animal’s physiological milk production cycle. When compared with LRM, daily <b>milk</b> <b>yields</b> predicted by the NHM were assumed to be functionally related to day in milk (or lactation) stage, milking intervals, and partial <b>milk</b> <b>yields.</b> Since the results were in terms of accuracies based on comparisons of different statistical models, accuracies of estimates of daily <b>milk</b> <b>yields</b> by NHM were close to those determined by the LRM. The average of these accuracies was 0. 94 for AM partial <b>milk</b> <b>yields</b> and 0. 93 for PM partial <b>milk</b> <b>yields</b> for first calving cows. However, the accuracies of AM/PM <b>milk</b> <b>yield</b> estimations from cows under a calving stage higher than the first parity were 0. 96 and 0. 95, respectively. Correlations between the estimated daily <b>milk</b> <b>yields</b> and the actual daily <b>milk</b> <b>yields</b> ranged from 0. 96 ~ 0. 98. These accuracies were lower for unbalanced AM/PM milking intervals and the first calving cows.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to model variations in test-day <b>milk</b> <b>yields</b> of first lactations of Holstein cows by RR using B-spline functions and Bayesian inference in order to fit adequate and parsimonious models for the estimation of genetic parameters. They used 152, 145 test day <b>milk</b> <b>yield</b> <b>records</b> from 7317 first lactations of Holstein cows. The model established in this study was additive, permanent environmental and residual random effects. In addition, contemporary group and linear and quadratic effects of the age of cow at calving were included as fixed effects. Authors modeled the average lactation curve of the population with a fourth-order orthogonal Legendre polynomial. They concluded that a cubic B-spline with seven random regression coefficients for both the additive genetic and permanent environment effects was to be the best according to residual mean square and residual variance estimates. Moreover they urged a lower order model (quadratic B-spline with seven random regression coefficients for both random effects) could be adopted because it yielded practically the same genetic parameter estimates with parsimony...|$|R

The average age at first calving was 38. 4 months and calving were most frequent between September and December. The average length of productive herd life of cows was 5. 42 lactations. The average interval between successive calvings was 395 days, and this was influenced by years and age. The mean generation interval was 6. 72 years. The average <b>milk</b> <b>yield</b> in 224 days was 338 gal. With {{a standard deviation of}} 152 gal. There was a close relationship between <b>milk</b> <b>yield</b> and lactation length; r = 0. 866 ± 0. 013. <b>Milk</b> <b>yield</b> increased by age until the fourth lactation. The rate of increase in yield between first and second lactation was highest and amounted to 22 %. Year of record had a pronounced effect on <b>milk</b> <b>yield.</b> Month of the calving had a slight effect on <b>milk</b> <b>yield.</b> The repeatability estimates of single <b>records</b> <b>milk</b> <b>yield,</b> calving intervals, lactation periods and dry periods were 0. 432 ± 0. 046, 0. 058 ± 0. 059, 0. 192 ± 0. 058 and 0. 069 ± 0. 065, respectively.

Data comprising 87045 test-day <b>milk</b> <b>yield</b> <b>records</b> from calving between 1997 and 2001 from Holstein herds in 10 regions of the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. Six persistency of lactation measures were evaluated using breeding values obtained by random regression analyses. The Wilmink function was used to model the additive genetic and permanent environmental effects. Residual variance was constant throughout lactation. Ranking for animals did not change among criteria for persistency measurements, but ranking changes were observed when the estimated breeding value (EBV) for persistency of lactation was contrasted with those estimated for 305 -day <b>milk</b> <b>yield</b> (305 MY). The rank correlation estimates for persistency of lactation and 305 MY were practically the same for sire and cows, and ranged from - 0. 45 to 0. 69. The EBVs for <b>milk</b> <b>yield</b> during lactation for sires producing daughters with superior 305 MY indicate genetic differences between sires regarding their ability to transmit desirable persistency of lactation traits. This suggests that selection for total lactation <b>milk</b> <b>yield</b> does not identify sires or cows that are genetically superior in regard to persistency of lactation.

The criteria used to verify the goodness-of-fit of each function were the adjusted coefficient of determination (Ra 2), residual plot, and percentage of deviation between observed and expected production. The mean Ra 2 values were higher than 0. 80 for the models used, except for the WK model. All curves exhibited typical patterns. The WD and WK functions underestimated 305 -day cumulative <b>milk</b> <b>yield</b> and presented greater deviations from the observed production.
