5|$|Founded in 1998 by Richard and Frances Guerrera, the Golden Age of Trucking <b>Museum</b> <b>was</b> a {{non-profit}} organization dedicated to trucking. The Guerreras owned and operated R.J. Guerrera, a liquid transportation trucking company. Originally, a collection of trucks were restored and stored in barns and garages throughout Connecticut. The Golden Age of Trucking <b>Museum</b> <b>was</b> opened to bring the collection under a single roof. After the property for the <b>museum</b> <b>was</b> purchased in July 1998, Richard Guerrera was diagnosed with cancer. In June 1999, he was transported to the site for an unofficial groundbreaking event. Richard Guerrera died a month later and the facility was completed in 2002. The <b>museum</b> <b>was</b> designed by Francis Guerrera's son-in-law, a general contractor. On September 23, 2002, the <b>museum</b> <b>was</b> formally opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony in the complete 32,000 square foot building.|$|E
