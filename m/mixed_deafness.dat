For two of these patients, microdeletions could be detected by using probe pHU 16 (DXS 26). One of these deletions also encompasses locus DXS 169, indicating that it extends farther toward the centromere. The presence of normal hybridization patterns in the DNA of 25 unrelated control males suggests that these deletions are {{the primary cause of}} progressive <b>mixed</b> <b>deafness</b> in these patients.

Conductive hearing loss caused by exposure to noise intensity that occur within a short time can cause trauma to the outer ear to the eardrum and middle ear. This was an observational cross sectional design. The sample in this study were employees of PT. X with inclusion criteria. Collecting data using tools such as questionnaires and for hearing loss was measured using a audiometer.

40|$|This is an {{informal}} {{case study of}} Deaf leadership as it evidences itself in a theatrical production setting. I call this approach to leadership Collective Individualism (2007). There {{is not a single}} leader; instead, there is often a group—a collective of sorts. The typical rehearsal structure for a theatrical production is a comfortable setting for this type of leadership to emerge, if the director is willing to be open to allowing it to happen. The 2016 production of Godspell produced at the National Technical Institute of The Deaf in their lab theatre, toured to the local LORT Theater here in Rochester, NY (Geva Theater), and then moved to New York City working in collaboration with the IRT Theater and performing at the Lexington School for the Deaf. This was a collaborative production, even on an administrative level. It is an accepted fact that Deaf culture emerges from a community effort (Gannon, 1981). Theatre is, by its very nature, a creative community. By analyzing the rehearsal and performance process with elements from several leadership theorists, a common theme appears. The influential leadership of the student/actors who have a strong self-identity and clearly exhibit more stage skills often outweighs positional leadership of working with hearing collaborators who are placed in positions of power—like a director. The process for observing Deaf leadership in this article will use the rehearsal process for Godspell (a musical performance piece that focuses on community building through the use of biblical parables) to mirror the typical formation of Deaf community with its <b>mix</b> of ethnicity (<b>deafness</b> occurs in all cultures and countries), it’s blend of mainstream hearing culture while maintaining a purity of Deaf culture linguistically, and its focus on the ensemble rather than the principle players...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} large two-generation {{pedigree}} with seven affected males segregating for an X-linked mixed conductive sensorineural deafness. The patients present with atypical Mondini-like dysplasia, dilated petrous facial canal, dilatation {{of the internal}} auditory meatus fully connected with enlarged cochlear canals, and, in one patient, a wide bulbous posterior labyrinth. Obligatory carrier females are mildly affected. Molecular characterization of this family revealed a deletion of locus DXS 169, in Xq 21. 1. Loci DXS 72 and DXS 26, which, respectively, flank DXS 169 proximally and distally, were intact. Since a gene responsible for X-linked progressive <b>mixed</b> <b>deafness</b> with perilymphatic gusher (DFN 3) has previously been assigned by deletion mapping to a slightly more distal interval between DXS 26 and DXS 121, this study indicates either two different deafness genes or the involvement {{of a very large}} region in Xq 21...|$|E
40|$|Brainstem {{auditory}} evoked potentials (BAEP) {{were recorded}} in two patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) irradiated and 14 and three years ago respectively and compared with 15 healthy controls. The patients had features of post-irradiation myelopathy of the brainstem with reduced gag reflex, unilateral vocal cord paralysis and fasciculation of the tongue. The first patient had a blind left eye. The second patient had quadriparesis. All ears revealed post-irradiation otitis media changes and <b>mixed</b> <b>deafness.</b> BAEP was not recognizable in the left ear of the first patient and was normal in the left ear of the second patient. Simultaneous electrochochleogram and BAEP were recorded from the right ear of the first case. The wave I-V latency interval were prolonged in both right ears.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{contiguous}} gene deletion syndromes by using reverse genetic techniques provides {{a powerful tool}} for precisely defining the map location of the genes involved. We have made use of individuals with overlapping deletions producing choroideremia as part of a complex phenotype, to define the boundaries on the X chromosome for this gene, as well as for X-linked <b>mixed</b> <b>deafness</b> with perilymphatic gusher (DFN 3). Two patients with deletions and choroideremia are affected by an X-linked mixed conductive/sensorineural deafness; one patient, XL- 62, was confirmed at surgery to have DFN 3, while the other patient, XL- 45, is suspected clinically to have the same disorder. A third choroideremia deletion patient, MBU, has normal hearing. Patient XL- 62 has a cytogenetically detectable deletion that was measured to be 7. 7 % of the X chromosome by dual laser flow cytometry; the other patient, XL- 45, has a cytogenetically undetectable deletion that measures only 3. 3 % of the X chromosome. We have produced a physical map of the X-chromosome region containing choroideremia and DFN 3 by using routine Southern blotting, chromosome walking and jumping techniques, and long-range restriction mapping to generate and link anonymous DNA sequences in this region. DXS 232 and DXS 233 are located within 450 kb of each other on the same SfiI and MluI fragments and share partial SalI fragments of 750 and greater than 1, 000 kb but are separated by at least one SalI site. In addition, DXS 232, which lies outside the MBU deletion, detects the proximal breakpoint of this deletion. We have isolated two new anonymous DNA sequences by chromosome jumping from DXS 233; one of these detects a new SfiI fragment distal to DXS 233 {{in the direction of the}} choroideremia gene, while the other jump clone is proximal to DXS 233 and detects a new polymorphism. These data refine the map around the loci for choroideremia and for <b>mixed</b> <b>deafness</b> with stapes fixation and will provide points from which to isolate candidate gene sequences for these disorders...|$|E
40|$|A stapes gusher is {{the result}} of a {{congenital}} inner ear anomaly showing at tone audiometry a conductive or mixed hearing loss. The conductive part of the hearing loss could lead to the thought to explore the middle ear. The congenital origin should lead to a high resolution. CT-scanning to evaluate a widening of the internal acoustic canal. Repeated audiometry could show especially a large conductive impairment in the lowest frequencies with a closure of the airbone gap at 2 khz and a high sensorineural high frequency loss at 4 and 8 khz. Contralateral stapedial reflexes may be present. Since the x-recessive <b>mixed</b> <b>deafness</b> syndrome (DFN 3) frequently involves males with an early childhood hearing impairment, clinical suspicion should be high. When stapes surgery is considered a precise medical history is essential regarding on the start of the hearing impairment. A continuous suspicion will guide to the audiological, radiological and molecular genetic clues to trace the correct diagnosis before embarking on stapes surgery...|$|E
40|$|We {{have found}} that the {{microsatellite}} marker AFM 207 zg 5 (DXS 995) maps to all previously described deletions which are associated with X-linked <b>mixed</b> <b>deafness</b> (DFN 3) with or without choroideremia and mental retardation. Employing this marker and pHU 16 (DXS 26) we have identified two partially overlapping yeast artificial chromosome clones which were used to construct a complete 850 kb cosmid contig. Cosmids from this contig have been tested by Southern blot analysis on DNA from 16 unrelated males with X-linked deafness. Two novel microdeletions were detected in patients which exhibit the characteristic DFN 3 phenotype. Both deletions are completely contained within one of the known DFN 3 -deletions, but one of them does not overlap with two previously described deletions in patients with contiguous gene syndromes consisting of DFN 3, choroideremia, and mental retardation. Assuming that only a single gene is involved, this suggests that the DFN 3 gene spans a chromosomal region of at least 400 kb...|$|E
40|$|The {{temporal}} bone encases conductive and sensorineural {{elements of the}} ear. Mutations of POU 3 F 4 are associated with unique {{temporal bone}} abnormalities and X-linked <b>mixed</b> <b>deafness</b> (DFNX 2 /DFN 3). However, the target genes and developmental processes controlled by POU 3 F 4 transcription factor activity have remained largely uncharacterized. Ephrin-B 2 (Efnb 2) is a signaling molecule with well-documented effects on cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration. Our analyses of targeted mouse mutants revealed that Efnb 2 loss-of-function phenocopies temporal bone abnormalities of Pou 3 f 4 hemizygous null neonates: qualitatively identical malformations of the stapes, styloid process, internal auditory canal, and cochlear capsule were present in both mutants. Using failed/insufficient separation of the stapes and styloid process as a quantitative trait, we found that single gene Efnb 2 loss-of-function and compound Pou 3 f 4 /Efnb 2 loss-of-function caused a more severe phenotype than single gene Pou 3 f 4 loss-of-function. Pou 3 f 4 and Efnb 2 gene expression domains overlapped {{at the site of}} impending stapes-styloid process separation and at subcapsular mesenchyme surrounding the cochlea; at both these sites, Efnb 2 expression was attenuated in Pou 3 f 4 hemizygous null mutants relative to control. Results of immunoprecipitation experiments using chromatin isolated from nascent middle ear mesenchyme supported the hypothesis of a physical association between Pou 3 f 4 and specific non-coding sequence of Efnb 2. We propose that Efnb 2 is a target of Pou 3 f 4 transcription factor activity and an effector of mesenchymal patterning during temporal bon...|$|E
40|$|This is a publisher’s {{version of}} an article {{published}} in Annals of Otology, Rhinology & Laryngology published by Annals Publishing Company. This version is reproduced with permission from Annals Publishing Company. [URL] aim {{of the study was to}} investigate whether the three-dimensional (3 -D) images from computed tomography (CT) scans of the ears could adequately define the site and extent of new bone in the cochlea, and how these images compared with those created by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patients whose investigations were used in the study were being assessed for a cochlear implant and were selected on the basis of their history and the appearance of their two-dimensional (2 -D) CT scans. Four patients had progressive <b>mixed</b> <b>deafness,</b> a family history of deafness, and stapedectomies. They were considered to be deaf from otosclerosis and needed further assessment because their scans showed either obstructed cochleas from new bone, or demineralized otic capsules to the point that we could not determine whether new bone was present or not. The fifth patient was being assessed within 3 months of suffering deafness from meningitis. In one ear he had extensive ossification, and in the other the degree of opacification shown in axial and coronal cuts of the basal turn was inconsistent. Essentially the problem is that at the magnification used in examination of the inner ear, the resolution of 2 -D CT scans gives indistinct borders between bone and water. Magnetic resonance imaging has commonly been used in these cases. The study showed that it is now possible to confirm whether or not there is new bone and to demonstrate the site and extent of new bone with both 3 -D and MRI images. It is not possible to give a degree of sensitivity and specificity for this observation because of the small group of subjects in the study. It should be worth applying the reconstruction software to scans from helical scanners with a view to assessing whether the resolution of the 3 -D images can be improved further. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|With {{the purpose}} to {{determine}} the relationships between noise and various hearing losses, the author studied the masking phenomena of the pure tone by air conduction and bone conduction {{in the presence of}} noises composed of various frequency components (although these were not completely white noise); and obtained the following results. 1. The masking curve of the normal ear {{in the presence of a}} given amount of noise approximately parallels with the spectrum curve obtained by the analysis of the noise employed. 2. The relationship between the change in the level of noise and the consequently appeared transition of the threshold under masking in the normal ear, differs according to differences in the frequency in the starting point of masking, but it changes in a straight line once the masking starts to take effect. 3. By drawing a masking curve under a given amount of noise of 108 ears with hearing loss, this curve was compared with the standard masking curve, the curve drawn from the average value of hearing threshold of 20 normal ears in the presence of 60 -phone noise. As the results it has been found that: A) Even if the difference between the two curves is under 5 db or as much as 10 db, as long as there is one or two frequencies only; namely, those that show the curve (the curve of unisolated type) that is about parallel with the standard curve occupy as much as the whole of those with conductive deafness, about 76. 4 per cent of those with perceptive deafness and 70 per cent of those with <b>mixed</b> <b>deafness.</b> B) Those that show a relatively big difference between the two curves, for example, a curve (curve of isolated type) that shows a difference as much as over 10 db, can be found in perceptive and <b>mixed</b> <b>deafness.</b> Four cases assumed to have retrolabyrinthine deafness show an uuexpectedly high value of the threshold along with the increase in the noise level, and also the changes in the their threshold transition are not in a straight line. 4. In order to study the relationship between the change in the noise level and the change in the threshold transition, the masking curve (standard curve) that shows the transfer of the normal ear threshold due to noise was compared with the masking curve of deaf ear. A) The curve (type I) where the transition of the threshold of deafness does not move so much as it will intersect the standard curve can be seen in 79 per cent; and next, the curve (type II) where the transition of the threshold moves as much as it intersects the standard curve can be observed in 21 per cent, showing the type I curve in a decidedly greater percentage. B) In observing the rate of appearance of the type I curve according to the sorts of deafness, namely, conduction deafness, perceptive and mixed ones, it is greatest in conduction deafness, followed by mixed one, and perceptive one in the order mentioned. 5. The curve (type A) which moves in a straight line about parallel with the standard curve from the time when the threshold of deaf ear starts to move under noise can be seen in 83 per cent; and the curve (type B) which gradually approaches the standard curve after the initiation of the threshold movement can be observed in 5 per cent; and the curve (type C) that moves rapidly away from the standard curve after the initiation of the threshold transfer can be seen in 12 per cent, indicating a preponderance of type A curve. 6. The masking curve of bone conduction in various ears, the same as in the case of air conduction, moves approximately in parallel with the curve obtained by the analysis of noise effect, and by the chages in the noise level the threshold moves in a straight line. Generally the rise in the threshold value is less in bone conduction than in air conduction, and the masking curve in conduction deafness somewhat coincides with that in normal ears. Moreover, the rate of appearance of type II curve is great in perceptive deafness...|$|E
