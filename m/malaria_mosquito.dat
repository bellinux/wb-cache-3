50|$|Thorsell {{started her}} studies on {{mosquitoes}} {{while working at}} the Swedish National Defence Research Institute (FOA). At that time claims circulated, from both the United States and the Soviet Union, that the other part was conducting experiments with <b>malaria</b> <b>mosquitos</b> in relations to biological warfare. The Swedish military therefore {{felt it necessary to}} develop a mosquito repellant, especially for <b>malaria</b> <b>mosquitoes,</b> to be used by Swedish soldiers. The existing repellants were either not efficient enough or had unwanted side effects, so Thorsell and her group of researchers at FOA began looking for a better agent. The substance diethylamide proved to be an excellent repellant for both <b>malaria</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> and ordinary Swedish forest mosquitoes. But in its unmodified form, it is water-soluble and was washed away by the sweat when applied on the soldiers. Thorsells' solution to this was to add the same functional groups as in diethylamide to mandelic acid. This resulted in a mosquito repellant called DEMIDEX, that was manufactured during a number of years. DEMIDEX was more efficient than the American DEET, which was and still is the most common active ingredient in insect repellents.|$|R

40|$|Although {{globally}} malaria {{mortality rates}} have fallen by 48 % between 2000 and 2015, malaria is still killing an estimated 438, 000 people each year. An {{effective way to}} alleviate the burden of malaria is to control its vector (<b>malaria</b> <b>mosquitoes)</b> using insecticides. This can be achieved either with insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) or through indoor residual spraying of insecticides (IRS). However, because of rapidly expanding insecticide resistance, {{there is a need}} to find alternatives to control the mosquitoes. Entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) could constitute an effective biological control tool, as is able to reduce malaria transmission under laboratory and field conditions. However, fundamental knowledge on the mechanisms and regulation of the infection process of the fungus, as well as insights into the defensive responses of the host insect to EPF, is limited. Therefore, the main goal of this thesis was to study virulence of the entomopathogenic fungus B. bassiana towards <b>malaria</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> using a multidisciplinary approach. Chapter 2 provides an overview of existing knowledge of genes influencing virulence in EPF, with a special focus on B. bassiana. The infection cycle and virulence mechanisms are discussed, and put in a framework of novel strategies and experimental methods that are needed to better understand virulence and improve the usage of EPF as a biocontrol agent. The study of natural variation in fungal virulence is a first step towards understanding the genetic mechanisms involved, because it reveals the extent of variation in the different components of virulence and their overall role. Chapter 3 describes the natural variation in virulence for 29 B. bassiana isolates that were tested on <b>malaria</b> <b>mosquitoes.</b> Furthermore, the phenotypic characteristics of the fungal isolates such as sporulation, spore size and growth were evaluated and their relationship with virulence analysed. Based on the ample natural variation observed in fungal virulence, in Chapter 4, a comparative genomics analysis was performed on five selected isolates of contrasting virulence. In order to understand mechanisms underlying contrasting virulence, a comparison on gene gain/loss, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), secreted proteins, and secondary metabolites was performed. Insight is provided to the magnitude of the complexity of a trait such as virulence and suggests candidate genes that can be further studied using a functional analysis approach. Chapter 5 focuses on an experimental evolution approach in which B. bassiana was solely using insects as a nutritional source for ten consecutive passages through <b>malaria</b> <b>mosquitoes.</b> Two isolates of B. bassiana that differed in virulence were compared to their respective ancestors, and they were assayed in virulence, fungal outgrowth, mycelial growth rate (MGR), and sporulation. Passage of the entomopathogenic fungi B. bassiana through the insect host resulted in an altered capacity to grow on different substrates while maintaining the ability to kill insects. Chapter 6 presents a discussion on the main findings of this thesis and describes future perspectives to study virulence of the entomopathogenic fungi Beauveria bassiana in the context of biological control of <b>malaria</b> <b>mosquitoes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Entomopathogenic fungi such as Beauveria bassiana are {{currently}} {{considered as a}} potential control agent for <b>malaria</b> <b>mosquitoes.</b> The success of such strategies depends among others on {{the efficacy of the}} fungus to kill its hosts. As B. bassiana can use various resources for growth and reproduction, increasing the dependency on mosquitoes as a nutritional source may be instrumental for reaching this goal. Passage of entomopathogenic fungi through an insect host has been shown to increase its virulence. We evaluated the virulence, fungal outgrowth, mycelial growth rate, and sporulation rate of two B. bassiana isolates (Bb 1520 and Bb 8028) that underwent 10 consecutive selection cycles through <b>malaria</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> (Anopheles coluzzii) using an experimental evolution approach. This cycling resulted in an altered capacity of evolved B. Bassiana lineages to grow on different substrates while maintaining the ability to kill insects. Notably, however, there were no significant changes in virulence or speed of outgrowth when comparing the evolved lineages against their unevolved ancestors. These results suggest that fungal growth and sporulation evolved through successive and exclusive use of an insect host as a nutritional resource. We discuss the results in light of biocontrol and provide suggestions to increase fungal virulence. <br/...|$|R
