25|$|A {{hypothetical}} vacuum <b>metastability</b> event {{would be}} theoretically possible if our universe {{were part of}} a metastable (false) vacuum in the first place, an issue that was highly theoretical and far from resolved in 1982. A false vacuum is one that appears stable, and is stable within certain limits and conditions, but is capable of being disrupted and entering a different state which is more stable. If this were the case, a bubble of lower-energy vacuum could come to exist by chance or otherwise in our universe, and catalyze the conversion of our universe to a lower energy state in a volume expanding at nearly the speed of light, destroying all of the observable universe without forewarning. Chaotic Inflation theory suggests that the universe may be in either a false vacuum or a true vacuum state.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Metastability,</b> a {{state in}} which signals (such as oscillatory waves) fall outside their natural {{equilibrium}} state but persist {{for an extended period}} of time, is a principle that describes the brain’s ability to make sense out of seemingly random environmental cues.

The Operational Architectonics is centered on {{the fact that in the}} metastable regime of brain functioning, the individual parts of the brain exhibit tendencies to function autonomously at the same time as they exhibit tendencies for coordinated activity. In accordance with , the synchronized operations produced by distributed neuronal assemblies constitute the metastable spatial-temporal patterns. They are metastable because intrinsic differences in the activity between neuronal assemblies are sufficiently large that they each do their own job (operation), while still retaining a tendency to be coordinated together in order to realize the complex brain operation.|$|E

A roll over effect is observed in the IVT characteristics for conditions of the sample for which the N 1 activation energy is larger than 100 meV. We show that these results are in good agreement with a recently proposed interpretation of admittance spectra, which relates the N 1 signature to a back contact barrier in CIGS solar cells. We also show that, within this model, {{the changes in the}} IV characteristics upon light soaking with blue light can be consistently explained with <b>metastabilities</b> in the CdS buffer layer.

2500|$|EEG {{measures}} the gross electrical {{activity of the}} brain that can be observed {{on the surface of the}} skull. In the <b>metastability</b> theory, EEG outputs produce oscillations that can be described as having identifiable patterns that correlate with each other at certain frequencies. [...] Each neuron in a neuronal network normally outputs a dynamical oscillatory waveform, but also has the ability to output a chaotic waveform. [...] When neurons are integrated into the neural network by interfacing neurons with each other, the dynamical oscillations created by each neuron can be combined to form highly predictable EEG oscillations.|$|E
2500|$|A second {{theory of}} <b>metastability</b> {{involves}} a so-called dynamic core, {{which is a}} term to loosely describe the thalamocortical region {{believed to be the}} integration center of consciousness. The dynamic core hypothesis (DCH) reflects the use and disuse of interconnected neuronal networks during stimulation of this region. [...] A computer model of 65,000 spiking neurons shows that neuronal groups existing in the cortex and thalamus interact in the form of synchronous oscillation. [...] The interaction between distinct neuronal groups forms the dynamic core and may help explain the nature of conscious experience. A critical feature of the DCH is that instead of thinking binarily about transitions between neural integration and non-integration (i.e., that the two are either one or the other with no in-between), the metastable nature of the dynamic core can allow for a continuum of integration.|$|E
