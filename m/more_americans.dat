In total, STS-97 brought 17tons of equipment to the ISS, which also included expandable metal girders, batteries, electronics and cooling equipment.|$|E
5|$|Even though Uncle Tom's Cabin was {{the best-selling}} {{novel of the}} 19th century, far <b>more</b> <b>Americans</b> of that time saw the story as a stage play or musical than read the book.

5|$|The Germans finally flanked the American {{forces at}} dusk, {{capturing}} them. Only one American, a forward artillery observer, was killed, while 14 were wounded: German casualties totaled 92.

Only when SS-Standartenführer Joachim Peiper and his Panzer tanks arrived at midnight, twelve hours behind schedule, did the Germans learn the nearby woods were empty.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. is {{a global}} leader in medical innovation. America solely {{developed}} or contributed significantly to 9 of the top 10 most important medical innovations since 1975 as ranked by a 2001 poll of physicians, while the European Union and Switzerland together contributed to five. Since 1966, <b>more</b> <b>Americans</b> have received the Nobel Prize in Medicine {{than the rest of}} the world combined. From 1989 to 2002, four times more money was invested in private biotechnology companies in America than in Europe. The U.S. health-care system far outspends any other nation, measured in both per capita spending and percentage of GDP.|$|E
5|$|As more middle-class and {{affluent}} people {{fled the}} city to the relative quiet and open spaces of the suburbs, the urban centers deteriorated and lost population. At the same time that cities were experiencing a lower tax base due to the flight of higher income earners, pressures from The New Deal forced them to offer pensions and other benefits, increasing the average cost of benefits per employee by 1,629percent. This was in addition to hiring an average of 20percent more employees to serve the ever shrinking cities. <b>More</b> <b>Americans</b> were driving cars and fewer were using public transportation, and it was not practical to extend to the suburbs. At the same time, the number of surface roads exploded to serve the ever-increasing numbers of individually owned cars, further burdening city and country resources. During this time, the perception of using public transportation turned more negative. In what is arguably the most extreme example, Detroit, the fifth largest city in the United States in 1950 with 1,849,568 residents, had shrunk to 706,585 by 2010, a reduction of 62 percent.|$|E

5|$|Following the United States gaining {{independence}} {{after their}} American Revolutionary War, in 1784, about 10,000 United Empire Loyalists settled in Upper Canada (what is now southern Ontario), chiefly in Niagara, around the Bay of Quinte, {{and along the}} St. Lawrence River between Lake Ontario and Montreal. The Crown granted them land in these areas {{in order to develop}} Upper Canada and to compensate them for losses in the United States. With former First Nations lands available for purchase, these new settlers were soon followed by many <b>more</b> <b>Americans,</b> attracted by the availability of inexpensive, arable land. At the same time, large numbers of Iroquois who had been allied with Britain arrived from the United States and were settled on reserves west of Lake Ontario as compensation for lands they lost in what was now the United States.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the {{invasion}} of Europe in June 1944, <b>more</b> <b>Americans</b> were dying in Home Front accidents than on World War II battlefields. Henry J. Kaiser, founder of the Richmond Shipyards, recognized that only a healthy work force could meet his deadlines and construction needs. He institutionalized a revolutionary idea, pre-paid medical care for workers, which soon expanded beyond workers. For many workers, {{this was the first}} time they had seen a doctor.|$|E
25|$|The German 9th Fallschirmjäger Regiment, 3rd Fallschirmjäger Division finally flanked and {{captured}} the American platoon at dusk, when they ran low on ammunition and {{were planning to}} withdraw.

50|$|According to Posner during 1996 {{there was}} about 15 times <b>more</b> <b>American</b> judges than English judges but only about 10 times <b>more</b> <b>American</b> lawyers than English lawyers. Posner {{suggests}} that English judges have <b>more</b> prestige than <b>American</b> judges and a related {{point is that the}} ratio of judges to lawyers is lower in England than the United States. The consequence of this is that the English common law system, as opposed to the American legal system, displays a legal culture of greater prestige and elitism not only in the judiciary but also those who are candidates for the judiciary.|$|R
50|$|Successive generations moved further inland, {{shifting}} {{the lines of}} settlement and wilderness, but preserving the essential tension between the two. European characteristics fell by the wayside and the old country's institutions (e.g., established churches, established aristocracies, standing armies, intrusive government, and highly unequal land distribution) were increasingly out of place. Every generation moved further west and became <b>more</b> <b>American,</b> <b>more</b> democratic, and more intolerant of hierarchy. They also became more violent, more individualistic, more distrustful of authority, less artistic, less scientific, and more dependent on ad-hoc organizations they formed themselves. In broad terms, the further west, the <b>more</b> <b>American</b> the community.|$|R

25|$|New York City {{was greatly}} damaged twice by fires of {{suspicious}} origin during British military rule. The city became {{the political and}} military center {{of operations for the}} British in North America {{for the remainder of the}} war and a haven for Loyalist refugees. Continental Army officer Nathan Hale was hanged in Manhattan for espionage. In addition, the British began to hold the majority of captured American prisoners of war aboard prison ships in Wallabout Bay, across the East River in Brooklyn. <b>More</b> <b>Americans</b> lost their lives from neglect aboard these ships than died in all the battles of the war. British occupation lasted until November 25, 1783. George Washington triumphantly returned to the city that day, as the last British forces left the city.|$|E
