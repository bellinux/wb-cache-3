It explores the links between social and {{structural}} aspects of the penal setting, the provision of mental healthcare in prisons, and <b>mental</b> health <b>work</b> in this environment. This analysis utilises qualitative interview data from prison-based fieldwork undertaken in Her Majesty׳s Prison Service, England. Two themes are discussed: (1) the desire and practicalities of doing <b>mental</b> health <b>work</b> and (2) prison staff as <b>mental</b> health <b>work</b> allies. Concepts covered include equivalence, training, ownership, informal communication, mental health knowledge, service gatekeepers, case identification, and unmet need. Implications for practice are (1) the mental health {{knowledge and understanding of}} prison wing staff could be appraised and developed to improve mental healthcare and address unmet need. Their role as observers and gatekeepers could be considered. (2) The realities of frontline <b>mental</b> health <b>work</b> for clinicians in the penal environment should be embraced and used to produce and implement improved policy and practice guidance, which is in better accord with the actuality of the context – both socially and structurally...|$|R

6000|$|To {{come back}} to my own case: I did not and could not {{know that it was}} an {{exceptional}} case, that my feeling for nature was something more than the sense of pleasure in sun and rain and wind and earth and water and in liberty of motion, which is universal in children, but was in part due to a faculty which is not universal or common. The fear, then, was an idle one, but I had good reason for it when I considered how it had been with my elder brothers, who had been as little restrained as myself, especially that masterful adventurous one, now in a distant country thousands of miles from home, who, at about the age at which I had now arrived, had made himself his own master, to do what he liked with his own life. I had seen him at his parting of the ways, how resolutely he had abandoned his open-air habits, everything in fact that had been his delight, to settle down to sheer hard <b>mental</b> <b>work,</b> and this at our home on the pampas where there were no masters, and even the books and instruments required for his studies could only be procured with great difficulty and after long delays. I remember one afternoon when we were gathered in the dining-room for tea, he was reading, and my mother coming in looked over his shoulder and said, [...] "You are reading a novel: don't you think all that romantic stuff will take your mind off your studies?" ...|$|E

[...] Pope {{could not have}} known the {{hundredth}} part of the number of 'sorts' of moss there are; and I suppose he only chose the word because it was a monosyllable beginning with m, and the best English general expression for despised and minute structures of plants. But a fate rules the words of wise men, which makes their words truer, and worth more, than the men themselves know. No other plants have so endless variety on so similar a structure as the mosses; and none teach so well the humility of Death. As for the death of our bodies, we have learned, wisely, or unwisely, to look the fact of that in the face. But none of us, I think, yet care to look the fact of the death of our minds in the face. I do not mean death of our souls, but of our <b>mental</b> <b>work.</b> So far as it is good art, indeed, and done in realistic form, it may perhaps not die; but so far as it was only good thought--good, for its time, and apparently a great achievement therein--that good, useful thought may yet in the future become a foolish thought, and then die quite away,--it, and the memory of it,--when better thought and knowledge come. But the better thought could not have come if the weaker thought had not come first, and died in sustaining the {20} better. If we think honestly, our thoughts will not only live usefully, but even perish usefully--like the moss--and become dark, not without due service. But if we think dishonestly, or malignantly, our thoughts will die like evil fungi,--dripping corrupt dew.|$|E

40|$|Traditionally {{the focus}} of <b>mental</b> health <b>work</b> with {{children}} and young people, including those seen as having behaviour problems and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), {{has been on the}} individual child or young person, and specifically on the identification, referral and treatment of their problem.

Subjects performing vigilance tasks exhibit elevated levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine, consistent with high stress levels and indicative of a significant mental workload. Vigilance tasks may therefore be assumed to be stressful, hard <b>mental</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

Such approaches are more likely {{to meet the needs of}} people with more severe mental problems and provide a more stable platform for specialist interventions than targeted programmes. The paper goes on to suggest some practical steps to sustain work at the school level. These steps include assessing the current position, developing the vision, identifying the gaps, determining readiness and assessing the scene for change, securing consensus, planning the change, establishing criteria, and managing, evaluating and maintaining the change...|$|R
