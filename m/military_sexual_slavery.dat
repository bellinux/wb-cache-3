40|$|This Article {{explores the}} {{advancement}} of the international crime of <b>sexual</b> <b>slavery,</b> from its initial inclusion in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court through further development in the delineation of the ICC 2 ̆ 7 s Elements of Crime document. This Article begins with a detailed exploration of the negotiation process {{that led to the}} inclusion of the crime of <b>sexual</b> <b>slavery</b> in the Rome Statute. The first Section describes the decision to include both <b>sexual</b> <b>slavery</b> and enforced prostitution as crimes, as well as the debate on listing <b>sexual</b> <b>slavery</b> as a crime separate from that of enslavement. Next, the Section turns to the listing of <b>sexual</b> <b>slavery</b> as a crime against humanity in the Statute of the Special Court for Sierra Leone. The second Section begins with the history of the drafting of the elements for <b>sexual</b> <b>slavery</b> in the Elements of Crime. This Section outlines various debates, such as those related to pecuniary exchange as an aspect of either slavery or enforced prostitution. Criticism of the elements of crime for <b>sexual</b> <b>slavery</b> is then explored. The third and final Section compares the approaches of the ICC and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia with respect to the crime of <b>sexual</b> <b>slavery.</b> The Article concludes by noting that the inclusion of <b>sexual</b> <b>slavery</b> in two important legal documents-the Rome Statute and the Statute of the Special Court for Sierra Leone-marks {{a turning point in the}} overt recognition of a particular form of slavery affecting many people worldwide, especially women and girls...|$|R

2500|$|Every Wednesday, living comfort women, women’s organizations, socio-civic groups, {{religious}} groups, and {{a number}} of individuals participate in the Wednesday Demonstrations in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul, sponsored by “The Korean Council for the Women Drafted for <b>Military</b> <b>Sexual</b> <b>Slavery</b> by Japan (KCWDMSS)”. It was first held on January 8, 1992, when Japan’s Prime Minister, Miyazawa, visited the Republic of Korea. In December 2011, a statue of a young woman was erected in front of the Japanese Embassy to honor the comfort women on the 1,000th Wednesday Demonstration. The Japanese government has repeatedly asked the South Korean government to have the statue taken down, but it has not been. On 28 December 2015, the Korean and Japanese governments agreed that the statue will be removed. As of 3 September 2016, the statue was still in place due to a majority of the South Korean population being opposed to the agreement. At the end of 2016, the statue was removed from the original location in Seoul, and re-erected in front of the Japanese consulate in Busan, South Korea. As of 6 January 2017, the Japanese government is attempting to negotiate the removal of the statue. [...] On May 11, 2017, newly elected South Korean President Moon Jae-in announced the agreement would not be enacted in its current stage and that negotiations for a deal between Japan and South Korea over the comfort women dispute had to start over.|$|E
