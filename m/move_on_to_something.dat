500|$|When {{the group}} arrived in California, Nirvana {{did a few}} days of {{pre-production}} where the band and Vig tightened up some of the song arrangements. The only recording carried over from the Smart Studios sessions was the song [...] "Polly", which included cymbal crashes performed by Chad Channing. Once recording commenced, the band worked eight to ten hours a day. The band members tended to take two or three tries at instrumental takes; if the takes were not satisfactory at that point, they would <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>something</b> else. The group had rehearsed the songs so much before recording started that often only a few takes were needed. Cobain used a variety of guitars, from Stratocasters to Jaguars, and Novoselic used a black 1979 and natural 1976 Gibson Ripper. Novoselic and Grohl finished their bass and drum tracks in a matter of days, but Cobain had to work longer on guitar overdubs, singing, and particularly lyrics (which sometimes were finished mere minutes before recording). Cobain's phrasing was so consistent on various takes that Vig would mix the takes together to create overdubs. Vig says that he often had to trick Cobain into recording additional takes for overdubs since the singer was averse to performing multiple takes. In particular, Vig convinced Cobain to double-track his vocals on the song [...] "In Bloom" [...] by telling him [...] "John Lennon did it." [...] While the sessions went well generally, Vig said Cobain would become moody and difficult at times: [...] "He'd be great for an hour, and then he'd sit in a corner and say nothing for an hour." ...|$|E

5000|$|Explorations was {{the second}} album Evans {{recorded}} with his trio of Scott LaFaro on bass and Paul Motian on drums. Evans considered it one of his favorites from this period. Producer Orrin Keepnews in the liner notes talks about the two extra pieces released on CD, [...] "Beautiful Love (take 1)" [...] and [...] "The Boy Next Door"; {{the first version of}} [...] "Beautiful Love" [...] {{to be included in the}} original LP was a second take, in fact as Keepnews specifies, [...] "it is not the usual case of a second attempt that immediately followed the first. Early in this date, he played this number once; we both approved, and he <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>something</b> else. Much later, he decided to try a second 'Beautiful Love', which he later preferred." [...] "The Boy Next Door" [...] was instead set aside, at the time, because of the limited space of LP support.|$|R
5000|$|She transitioned {{from acting}} to {{television}} production in 1964. She had initially {{applied to the}} BBC and taught school in Scotland before breaking into production. She recalled her entry into the industry in a 2014 interview, telling Scotland Now, [...] "I had applied to the BBC in 1964 when they were getting ready for BBC2, and I had been accepted - but they lost my file and because I had a teaching degree, I came back up to Glasgow and started teaching at Bellahouston Academy. I can remember in 1963 when the kids came in, talking about this brilliant TV show they had seen the Saturday night before, and I said, What do you mean, its set in a police box?...Then in 1964 I went to the BBC as a relief assistant floor manager, where you were slotted into various programmes.

5000|$|Valerie Siebert {{said that}} she [...] "felt with the Style Council that Weller managed to keep {{slightly}} {{ahead of the curve}} in terms of trends," [...] and later asked Weller in an interview for The Quietus that, [...] "with Modernism: A New Decade, do you think you were just a little too ahead, seeing as that type of music would become huge a few years later?". Weller replied [...] "I guess so yeah, it might have been that it was too early. But yeah at the time, for me, it was pretty cutting edge. But the record company didn't like it - they hated it actually! They didn't understand it whatsoever. They just {{thought it was going to}} be the final nail in my career coffin. And then that's why we split. But you know, sometimes you're ahead of the game and sometimes people don't get it and that's just one of those things you have to accept and carry on."

2500|$|Use of {{the term}} [...] "spyware" [...] has {{eventually}} declined as the practice of tracking users has been pushed ever further into the mainstream by major websites and data mining companies; these generally break no known laws and compel users to be tracked, not by fraudulent practices per se, but by the default settings created for users and the language of terms-of-service agreements. In one documented example, on CBS/CNet News reported, on March 7, 2011, [...] on a Wall Street Journal analysis revealing the practice of Facebook and other websites of tracking users' browsing activity, linked to their identity, far beyond users' visits and activity within the Facebook site itself. The report stated: [...] "Here's how it works. You go to Facebook, you log in, you spend some time there, and then ... you <b>move</b> <b>on</b> without logging out. Let's say the next site you go to is New York Times. Those buttons, without you clicking on them, have just reported back to Facebook and Twitter that you went there and also your identity within those accounts. Let's say you <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>something</b> like a site about depression. This one also has a tweet button, a Google widget, and those, too, can report back {{who you are and}} that you went there."

50|$|This is how Raphaël Sorin {{presented}} him in l’Express when his Dictionnaire Rimbaud {{came out in}} 1991. A late calling though: after quoting a quotation of Arthur to his professor Izambard in an editorial in Max—the magazine that he directed at the time, he received so much mail {{that he decided to}} go into more depth on the subject. He continues to do so—publishing his findings on a regular basis. His vision of Rimbaud is far from the usual clichés of the damned poet. According to him, the poet is too intelligent (the best in his class) to be incoherent. His poems always have a meaning, are coherent, and have a mission. Rimbaud is determined and wilful. He completely gives himself over to poetry because he is certain that it can be life changing. Une Saison en enfer, which is a quest for salvation, is also a written essay of a new bible for modern times. The poetry is thus a means and not an end, a tool, at the service of a very spiritual and humanist ideal. So, when he finds himself persuaded of its inefficiency—it being much slower than he had hoped—he discards it and <b>moves</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>something</b> else. The vision of Claude Jeancolas is very human, and his Rimbaud, with his dreams, doubts, anger, lassitude and failures is brought closer to the reader, which explains the success of this biography with the general public. He has also redeemed his well criticised mother, Vitalie Rimbaud, in a biography that shows the intense love that attached this mother to her preferred child; and conversely, the necessity of this mother for Rimbaud to be able to become the man that we know.|$|R
2500|$|Later {{on in the}} letter, Gottlieb {{stated that}} he still had faith in Toole {{as a writer and}} that he wished to hold onto the {{manuscript}} in case he or Toole would be able to see a way around his objections. Toole decided that it would be best for Gottlieb to return the manuscript, saying [...] "Aside from a few deletions, I don't think I could really do much to the book now—and of course even with revisions you might not be satisfied." [...] Toole made a trip to New York to see Gottlieb in person; however, he was out of town and Toole came back disappointed. He felt that he had embarrassed himself by giving a rambling, uncomfortable speech explaining his situation to one of Gottlieb's office staff. He returned home having left a note for Gottlieb to call him, and they later talked for an hour on the phone. In this conversation Gottlieb re-iterated that he would not accept the novel without further revision. He suggested that Toole <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> writing <b>something</b> else, an idea which Toole ultimately rejected.|$|R

40|$|I {{argue that}} the strong {{transcendental}} strategy can offer us a serious and robust response the sceptic who doubts {{that we can have}} knowledge of the extra-mental. This sceptic is motivated by sceptical hypotheses to worry that I could have all the thoughts and experiences I do in fact have if the world were radically different to how I take it to be. Transcendental arguments start from a premise about our thoughts or experience and <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> show that <b>something</b> must be the case because it is a necessary condition of our having such thoughts or experience. As such, transcendental arguments are particularly well-positioned to answer this sceptic, as the premises of a transcendental argument are drawn from the mental propositions the sceptic accepts. Some philosophers have argued that the same concerns that drive the sceptic to doubt the extra-mental should also give her cause to doubt the mental. To prevent the sceptic retreating to this thought, I show that these arguments are only effective against propositions that were unlikely to form the basis of a transcendental argument. Strong transcendental arguments (STAs) are differentiated from weak transcendental arguments as being those that move from mental premises to conclusions about the extra-mental world. I defend STAs against Stroud’s objection that this is not possible, on the basis that the objection rests on an illicit assumption of dualism about mind and world. I argue for the plausibility of supervenience physicalism as a metaphysical picture upon which such inferences would be possible. I show how a dispositionally essentialist understanding of the laws of nature would plausibly support a metaphysically necessary psychophysical law, from which we could draw the bridging premise of an STA. This changes the dialectic, forcing the sceptic to defend specific metaphysical positions, such as resemblance nominalism, and to engage substantially with philosophy. The plausibility of strong transcendental arguments tells us something of what must be true of the world for the sceptic’s arguments to even get started...|$|R
