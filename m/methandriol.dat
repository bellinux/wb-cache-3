40|$|Abstract] Methandienone, <b>methandriol,</b> and oxymetholone, {{which are}} {{anabolic}} steroids possessing 1 7 a-methyl and 171 S-hydroxy groups, were developed as oral formulations for therapeutic purposes. However, {{they have been}} used in racehorses to enhance racing performance. In humans, {{it has been reported that}} structurally related anabolic steroids having the 17 a-methyl and 171 ~hydroxy groups, including 17 a-methyltestosterone, mestanolone, methandienone, <b>methandriol,</b> and oxymetholone, have metabolites in common. In this study, we found that metabolites common to those of 17 a-methyltestosterone and mestanolone were detected in horse urine after the administration of oxymetholone, methandienone, and <b>methandriol.</b> Based on analytical data, we confirmed these to be the common metabolites of five structurally related steroids, 17 o. -methyltestosterone, mestanolone, oxymetholone, methandienone, and <b>methandriol.</b> Furthermore, wedetected hitherto unknown urinary metabolites of <b>methandriol</b> and oxymetholone in horses. The parent steroid itself was detected in horse urine after the administration of <b>methandriol,</b> other than metabolites common to 17 a-methyltestosterone and mestanolone. O the other hand, the major metabolite of oxymetholone was mestanolone, aside from metabolites presumed to be the stereoisomers of 2 -hydroxymethyl- 17 o. -methyl- 5 o. -androstan- 3, 17 l]-diol and 2, 1 7 a-di(hydroxymethyl) - 5 a-androstan- 3, 1 71 ~-diol. The simultaneous detection f common metabolites and other main metabolites would help us narrow down the candidate-administered steroid for the doping tests in racehorses...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{potential}} for misuse {{of a wide range}} of anabolic steroids in horse racing, a screening test to detect multiple compounds, via a common class of metabolites, would be a valuable forensic tool. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed to detect 17 a-alkyl anabolic steroid metabolites in equine urine. 16 ߭Hydroxymestanolone (16 ߬ 17 ߭dihydroxy- 17 a-methyl- 5 a-androstan- 3 -one) was synthesised in six steps from commercially available epiandrosterone (3 ߭hydroxy- 5 a-androstan- 17 -one). Polyclonal antibodies were raised in sheep, employing mestanolone (17 ߭hydroxy- 17 a-methyl- 5 a-androstan- 3 -one) or 16 ߭hydroxymestanolone conjugated to human serum albumin, via a 3 -carboxymethyloxime linker, as antigens. Antibody cross-reactivities were determined by assessing the ability of a library of 54 representative steroids to competitively bind the antibodies. Antibodies raised against 16 ߭hydroxymestanolone showed excellent cross-reactivities for all of the 16 ߬ 17 ߭dihydroxy- 17 a-methyl steroids analysed and an ELISA has been developed to detect these steroid metabolites. Using this 16 ߭hydroxymestanolone assay, urine samples from horses administered with stanozolol (17 a-methyl-pyrazolo[4 ', 3 ': 2, 3]- 5 a-androstan- 17 ߭ol), were analysed raw, following ߭glucuronidase hydrolysis, and following solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedures. The suppressed absorbances observed were consistent with detection of the metabolite 16 ߭hydroxystanozolol. Positive screening results were confirmed by comparison with standard LCMS analyses. Antibodies raised against mestanolone were also used to develop an ELISA and this was used to detect metabolites retaining the parent D-ring structure following <b>methandriol</b> (17 a-methylandrost- 5 -ene- 3 ߬ 17 ߭diol) administration. The ELISA methods developed have application as primary screening tools for detection of new and known anabolic steroid metabolites. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|This study {{comprises}} Ph. D. work entitled: â€œIsolation and Analytical Characterization of Phytochemicals from Some Selected Indigenous Medicinal Plantsâ€�. In this regard, five plants species namely Abies pindrow, Salvadora oleiodes, Aerva javanica, Alhagi maurorum (Alhagi camelorum) and Calligonum polygonoides were selected. The work {{described in}} this thesis comprises of extraction, isolation and identification of phytochemicals constituents using chromatographic, spectroscopic and x-rays crystallographic techniques. In all, 106 compounds were identified from these selected plant species. From Abies pindrow leaves, maltol (3 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl- 4 H-pyran- 4 -one) (1) was isolated, which is neutral, heterocyclic aroma compound; widely known as food additive, antioxidant and metal ions chelator. In another study, eleven fatty acids including eight saturated and three unsaturated fatty acids ranging from C 14 to C 24 and eleven hydrocarbons including nine saturated two unsaturated ranging from C 17 to C 24 were identified from the leaves of Abies pindrow. Chemical compositions of the essential oil of Salvadora oleiodes revealed the total 35 (94. 0 %) and 25 (91. 1 %) chemical constituents in oil of leaves and stem, respectively. The major chemical constituent of the leaves and stem oil was 2 -methoxy- 4 -vinylphenol. Chemical compositions of the essential oil of Aerva javanica revealed the total 16 (82. 96 %), 16 (78. 92 %) chemical constituents in oil of leaves and stem, respectively. The major chemical constituents of the leaves and stem oil were hentriacontane (21. 48 %) and nonacosane (23. 26 %), respectively. Aerva javanica seed essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation (HD) and dry steam distillation (SD) extracting methods. Total 20 (90. 5 %) and 18 (95. 6 %) chemical constituents were identified, using HD and SD, respectively. The major constituent identified from seed essential oil was heptacosane. Chemical compositions of the essential oil of Alhagi maurorum revealed the, total 16 (56. 8 %) and 21 (76. 7 %) chemical constituents in oil of leaves and stem respectively. Preliminary phytochemicals screening revealed that alkaloids, tannins, saponins, flavonoids, steroids, phenols, carbohydrates, proteins and terpenoids {{are present in the}} roots, stems, buds, flowers and seeds of Calligonum polygonoides, whereas amino acids, cardiac glycoside and phlobatannins are absent. Chemical compositions of the essential oil of C. polygonoides revealed the, total 23 (97. 3 %), 25 (92. 2 %), 27 (68. 42 %), and 10 (82. 12 %) chemical constituents in oil of fruit, stem, buds and root respectively. The major chemical constituents of the fruit, stem, buds and root oil were (Z,Z) - 9, 12 -octadecadienoic acid (40. 7 %), hexadecanoic acid (42. 9 %), homovanillate (11. 79 %) and drimenol (29. 42 %), respectively. From C. polygonoides campesterol (102), stigmasterol (103), (3 Ã¢, 5 Ã¡, 24 S) - stigmastan- 3 -ol (104), stigmast- 4 -en- 3 -one (105) and <b>methandriol</b> (106) were isolated. Extraction, isolation and identification of compounds were carried out by using latest sophisticated instrumental techniques. The chromatographic techniques were used to separate these compounds and the identities of these compounds were checked by physical and chemical methods. Finally the structures were elucidated by different spectroscopic methods including FTIR, UV, EIMS, 1 H and 13 CNMR. The structures of these compounds were also further confirmed through x-ray crystallographic analysis...|$|E
40|$|This study {{tried to}} {{investigate}} the metabolism of the anabolic steroids dehydroepiandrosterone (DHA), <b>methandriol</b> (MAD) and 17 &# 945;-methyltestosterone (17 &# 945;-MT) in the Equine and to subsequently develop a gas-chromatographic / mass-spectrometric (gc/ms) screening method {{for the detection of}} the two latter orally-active anabolic agents. For each experiment 200 mg of the respective steroid were administered to two thoroughbred horses in training. The administered substances contained a mixture of the same amount of deuterated and non-deuterated steroid. Additionally, a radioactive isotop was administered in the DHA (3 H-DHA and 14 C-DHA) and MAD (3 H-MAD) studies. In the case of 17 &# 945;-MT no radioactive isotop was administered. Blood samples were taken at regular intervals for a three- up to a five-day period. Freely- voided urine was collected for the same period of time. The absorption and elimination of the administered steroids were determined by scintigraphy of the ß-emission in all radio labelled samples collected. Only the urine samples were subsequently extracted for the detection of possible steroid metabolites by gc/ms-analysis. The half-life of intramuscularly administered 3 H-DHA ranged from between 9 to 12 h. The half-life of orally administered 14 C-DHA was around 3 h in both horses and hence about ¼ to &# 8531; that of 3 H-DHA. This can mainly be explained by the first-pass effect to which orally administered 14 C-DHA had been exposed in the liver. The half-life of orally administered 3 H-MAD was 11. 99 h for one of the two horses. This value is similar to the one for intramuscularly administered 3 H-DHA. This would indicate that the 17 &# 945;-alkylation has protected the orally administered MAD from the first-pass effect of the liver. For the second horse the half-life was only 3. 75 h, which is similar to the one for orally administered 14 C-DHA being exposed to the first-pass effect of the liver. This large difference in half-life could not be explained. Overall, about 60 % of the total intramuscularly administered 3 H-DHA was excreted via the urine. For orally administered 14 C-DHA and 3 H-MAD this value was about 50 %. In 3 H-DHA and 3 H-MAD &# 8805; 95 % of the radioactive dose excreted via the urine had been excreted only after 50 h. For 14 C-DHA this value had already been reached between 30 - 35 h after administration of the steroid. The urinalysis of the radioactively labelled steroids showed great losses of radioactivity, i. e., of steroid metabolites in the urine after extraction {{as well as in the}} solutions used for washing the extracts. Two main reasons were assumed for these losses: (1) it was thought that losses which occurred into the urine after extraction were at least partly caused by capacity problems of the cartridges used; whereas (2) losses into solutions used for washing the different extracts might have their origin in the existence of a number of very polar metabolite(s), which were hence washed out of the lipophilic extracts by the hydrophilic wash solutions used. Due to these losses the gc/ms analysis of DHA and MAD partly showed rather unsatisfactory results; most of the detected metabolites were only present in very low concentrations. This resulted in difficulties to assign the appropriate chemical structure to a number of the detected metabolites. In general, DHA and its metabolites were excreted only to a very low percentage as free steroids (< 2 %). About 10 - 15 % were excreted as conjugates with glucuronic acid while around 60 % of the metabolites showed a conjugation with sulphuric acid. The excretion pattern of MAD and its metabolites showed similar results; where only around 4 % were excreted as free steroid, while 10 - 15 % were excreted as conjugates of glucuronic acid and around 50 % as conjugates of sulphuric acid. The following three metabolites have been determined for DHA: 1. 3 ß-Hydroxyandrost- 5 -en- 17 -one (I = parent drug), 2. 5 -Androsten- 3, 17 -diol (II/ 4 isomers), and 3. 5 -Androstane- 3, 17 -diol (III/ 2 isomers). The following five metabolites have been determined for MAD: 1. 17 &# 945;-Methyl- 5 -androsten- 3 ß, 17 ß-diol (I/ 2 isomers = parent drug), 2. 17 -Hydroxy- 17 &# 945;-Methyl- 5 -androstane- 3 ß-ol (II), 3. 17 -Hydroxy- 17 &# 945;-Methyl- 5 -androstane- 3,(15 / 16) -diol (IV), 4. 17 -Hydroxy- 17 &# 945;-Methyl- 5 -androstane- 3,(6 / 7), 16 -triol (V/ 2 isomers), 5. 17 -Hydroxy- 17 &# 945;-Methyl-androst- 4 -en-(6 / 7), 16 -diol- 3 -one (VI), as well as Since in the case of 17 &# 945;-MT no radioactively labelled isotope had been administered no information could be obtained about the absorption or excretion profile, the plasma half-life of the substance or the extent of its phase-II metabolism in the horse. The gc/ms analysis of this steroid though showed a large number of metabolites present in the analysed extracts in viable concentrations. It was therefore assumed that the losses during urinalysis as described for DHA and MAD did not occur at all or only to a much lesser extend in the case of 17 &# 945;-MT. The following 12 metabolites have been determined for 17 &# 945;-MT: 1. 17 &# 945;-Methyl- 17 ß-Hydroxy- 4 -androsten- 3 -one 2. 17 -Hydroxy- 17 &# 945;-methyl- 5 -androstane- 3 -ol 3. 17 -Hydroxy- 17 &# 945;-methyl- 5 -androstane-(6 / 7) -ol- 3 -one 4. 17 -Hydroxy- 17 &# 945;-methyl-androst- 4 -en-(6 / 7) -ol- 3 -one 5. 17 -Hydroxy- 17 &# 945;-methyl- 5 -androstane- 3,(6 / 7 or 15 / 16) -diol 6. 17 -Hydroxy- 17 &# 945;-methyl- 5 -androst- 3,(6 / 7) -diol 7. 17 -Hydroxy- 17 &# 945;-methyl- 5 -androstane- 3, 16 -diol 8. 17 -Hydroxy- 17 &# 945;-methyl- 5 -androstane- 3,(6 / 7),(15 / 16) -triol 9. 17 -Hydroxy- 17 &# 945;-methyl- 5 -androstane- 3,(6 / 7), 16 -triol 10. 17 -Hydroxy- 17 &# 945;-methyl-androst- 4 -en- 3,(6 / 7),(15 / 16) -triol 11. 17 -Hydroxy- 17 &# 945;-methyl-androst- 4 -en-(6 / 7), 16 -diol- 3 -one 12. 17 -Hydroxy- 17 &# 945;-methyl- 5 -androstane-(6 / 7),(15 / 16) -diol- 3 -one For MAD the prerequisite for the establishment of a routine detection method is the optimization of the method used, which in its current form does not yet yield sufficient results viable to be included into a screening-analysis procedure. For 17 &# 945;-MT instead the search for metabolites 2, 6, 7 and 9 during a routine gc/ms screening analysis is considered sufficient to prove the administration of 17 &# 945;-MT to the horse for doping purposes. Using 'single ion monitoring (SIM) ' it should be screened for the fragment ions with the mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios m/z 143, m/z 218 and m/z 231 since they are characteristic for all 17 &# 945;-methylated steroids. This method allows the detection of a 17 &# 945;-MT application to the horse for a period of at least 50 h after administration. Since in the course of this study no later urine samples had been collected, additional studies will be needed to determine the maximum time of detection after administration of 17 &# 945;-MT to a horse for doping purposes when using this method of extraction and analysis...|$|E
