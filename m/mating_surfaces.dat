25|$|Jointed rails {{were used}} {{at first because}} {{contemporary}} technology did not offer any alternative. However, the intrinsic weakness in resisting vertical loading results in the ballast becoming depressed and a heavy maintenance workload is imposed to prevent unacceptable geometrical defects at the joints. The joints also needed to be lubricated, and wear at the fishplate (joint bar) <b>mating</b> <b>surfaces</b> needed to be rectified by shimming. For this reason jointed track is not financially appropriate for heavily operated railroads.|$|E
25|$|The {{work done}} by {{friction}} can translate into deformation, wear, and heat that can affect the contact surface properties (even the coefficient of friction between the surfaces). This can be beneficial as in polishing. The work of friction is used to mix and join materials {{such as in the}} process of friction welding. Excessive erosion or wear of mating sliding surfaces occurs when work due to frictional forces rise to unacceptable levels. Harder corrosion particles caught between <b>mating</b> <b>surfaces</b> in relative motion (fretting) exacerbates wear of frictional forces. Bearing seizure or failure may result from excessive wear due to work of friction. As surfaces are worn by work due to friction, fit and surface finish of an object may degrade until it no longer functions properly.|$|E

500|$|A parting line, sprue, gate marks, and {{ejector pin}} marks are usually {{present on the}} final part. [...] None of these {{features}} are typically desired, but are unavoidable {{due to the nature}} of the process. Gate marks occur at the gate which joins the melt-delivery channels (sprue and runner) to the part forming cavity. Parting line and ejector pin marks result from minute misalignments, wear, gaseous vents, clearances for adjacent parts in relative motion, and/or dimensional differences of the <b>mating</b> <b>surfaces</b> contacting the injected polymer. Dimensional differences can be attributed to non-uniform, pressure-induced deformation during injection, machining tolerances, and non-uniform thermal expansion and contraction of mould components, which experience rapid cycling during the injection, packing, cooling, and ejection phases of the process. Mould components are often designed with materials of various coefficients of thermal expansion. These factors cannot be simultaneously accounted for without astronomical increases in the cost of design, fabrication, processing, and quality monitoring. The skillful mould and part designer will position these aesthetic detriments in hidden areas if feasible.|$|E

5000|$|Valve {{seats are}} often formed by first {{press-fitting}} an approximately cylindrical {{piece of a}} hardened metal alloy, such as Stellite, into a cast depression in a cylinder head above each eventual valve stem position, and then machining a conical-section surface into the valve seat that will mate with a corresponding conical-section of the corresponding valve. Generally two conical-section surfaces, one with a wider cone angle and one with a narrower cone-angle, are machined {{above and below the}} actual <b>mating</b> <b>surface,</b> to form the <b>mating</b> <b>surface</b> to the proper width (called [...] "narrowing" [...] the seat), and to enable it to be properly located with respect to the (wider) <b>mating</b> <b>surface</b> of the valve, so as to provide good sealing and heat transfer, when the valve is closed, and to provide good gas-flow characteristics through the valve, when it is opened.|$|R

40|$|Surface {{topography}} of harder <b>mating</b> <b>surface</b> {{plays an important}} role in metal forming operations as it predominantly controls the frictional behavior at the interface. In the present investigation, an inclined scratch tester was used to understand the effect of direction of surface grinding marks on interface friction and transfer layer formation. EN 8 steel flats were ground to attain different surface roughnesses with unidirectional grinding marks. Al–Mg alloy pins were then scratched against the prepared EN 8 steel flats. The grinding angle (angle between direction of scratch and grinding marks) was varied between 0 deg and 90 deg during the scratch tests. Scanning electron micrography of the contact surfaces revealed the transfer layer morphology. The coefficient of friction and transfer layer formation were observed to depend primarily on the direction of grinding marks of the harder <b>mating</b> <b>surface,</b> and independent of the surface roughness of harder <b>mating</b> <b>surface.</b> The grinding angle effect was attributed to the variation of plowing component of friction with grinding angle...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{characteristics}} of thermally sprayed WC-Cr-Ni cermet coating under lubricated rolling with sliding contact condition were examined experimentally. Experiments were performed using a two-roller testing machine. The coating was formed onto the blasted or ground roller specimens made of thermally refined carbon steel or induction hardened carbon steel by high energy type flame spraying (Hi-HVOF). A mirror-like finished cermet coated steel roller was mated with a noncoated carburized hardened steel roller. In {{the case of}} thermally refined steel substrate and for the <b>mating</b> <b>surface</b> roughness R max= 0. 1 µm, coating on the ground substrate showed lower durability than that on the blasted substrate. For the <b>mating</b> <b>surface</b> roughness Rmax= 3. 0 µm, coating on the ground substrate showed an extremely short life as compared with that on the blasted substrate. In general, durability of cermet coating was greatly increased due {{to the increase in}} the coating thickness. In the case of induction hardened steel substrate, coating on the blasted or ground substrate showed high durability for both R max= 0. 1 µm and 3. 0 µm. Coefficient of friction and oil film thickness were markedly influenced by the <b>mating</b> <b>surface</b> roughness but these were hardly affected by the substrate material. In addition, depending on the <b>mating</b> <b>surface</b> roughness, significant differences in the surface roughness of coated roller and depth of flaking on the coated roller were found...|$|R

40|$|Durability and {{tribological}} {{properties of}} thermally sprayed WC-Cr-Ni cermet coating were investigated experimentally in lubricated rolling with sliding contact conditions. By {{means of the}} high energy type flame spraying (Hi-HVOF) method, the coating was formed onto the axially ground and circumferentially ground roller specimens made of a thermally refined carbon steel. In the experiments, the WC cermet coated steel roller was mated with the carburized hardened steel roller without coating in line contact condition. The coated roller was mated with the smooth non-coated roller under a contact pressure of 1. 0 or 1. 2 GPa, and it was mated with the rough non-coated roller under a contact pressure of 0. 6 or 0. 8 GPa. As a result, {{it was found that}} in general, the coating on the circumferentially ground substrate shows a lower durability compared with that on the axially ground substrate and this difference appears more distinctly for the higher contact pressure for both smooth <b>mating</b> <b>surface</b> and rough <b>mating</b> <b>surface.</b> It was also found that there are significant differences in the tribological properties of WC cermet coating depending on the contact pressure.
