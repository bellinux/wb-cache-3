5|$|When meeting {{another of}} the same species, P. fimbriata does not stalk but {{displays}} by moving quickly and smoothly, and displays at 4 to 27centimetres away. It raises its legs, its body sways from side to side, and the palps are lowered below the chelicerae ("fangs"). This {{is very different from}} the stalking it uses when encountering another salticid of a different species, despite receiving the same visual stimulus, the sight of the other's large anterior-median eyes. Although P. fimbriata is influenced by pheromones much more than is usual among salticids, visual cues alone are enough to start displays and distinguish <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> species from other salticids, even if neither partner moves. The spindly, fringed legs of Portia species may identify <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> species, as well as concealing these spiders from other salticid species.|$|E
5|$|Although adult lions have {{no natural}} predators, {{evidence}} suggests that the majority die violently from humans or other lions. Lions often inflict serious injuries on each other, either members of different prides encountering each other in territorial disputes, or <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> pride fighting at a kill. Crippled lions and lion cubs may fall victim to hyenas, leopards, or be trampled by buffalo or elephants, and careless lions may be maimed when hunting prey.|$|E
5|$|Bakerian mimicry, {{named after}} Herbert G. Baker, {{is a form}} of automimicry where female flowers mimic male flowers of their own species, {{cheating}} pollinators out of a reward. This reproductive mimicry may not be readily apparent as <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> species may still exhibit some degree of sexual dimorphism. It is common in many species of Caricaceae.|$|E

5|$|Dengue fever virus (DENV) is an RNA virus of {{the family}} Flaviviridae; genus Flavivirus. Other <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> genus include yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, St. Louis {{encephalitis}} virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus, and Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus. Most are transmitted by arthropods (mosquitoes or ticks), and are therefore {{also referred to as}} arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses).|$|E
5|$|It {{has often}} been claimed that ceratopsian dinosaurs were herding animals, due to {{the large number of}} known bone beds {{containing}} multiple <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> ceratopsian species. In 2010, Hunt and Farke pointed out that this was mainly true for centrosaurine ceratopsians. Horner assumed that the horned dinosaurs at Landslide Butte lived in herds that had been killed by drought or disease. Dodson concluded that the fact that the Achelousaurus bone beds were monospecific (containing only one species) confirmed the existence of herds.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} can act on any heritable phenotypic trait, {{and selective}} pressure {{can be produced}} by any aspect of the environment, including sexual selection and competition with <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> or other species. However, this {{does not imply that}} natural selection is always directional and results in adaptive evolution; natural selection often results in the maintenance of the status quo by eliminating less fit variants.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of his career, Moser {{collected}} over 25,000 mycological specimens. He first described around 420 Cortinarius species and around 80 other species, including both agarics and boletes. He circumscribed three new genera: Singeromyces (1966), Stephanopus (1975) and Anamika (2002). Much of his research covered four key areas: the taxonomy of Agaricales—including the classical morphotaxonomy and the chemotaxonomy of the order—the toxicity of the chemical constituents of <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> order, and the ecology of ectomycorrhiza.|$|E
5|$|Patterns {{of genetic}} {{variation}} in the camas pocket gopher have been studied. Although there are no subspecies, there is substantial genetic diversity within the species. Its genetic patterns are consistent with limited inbreeding within specific populations. This is similar to patterns described in Botta's pocket gopher and the southern pocket gopher, {{both of which are}} <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> genus. However, it contrasts with patterns noted in Baird's pocket gopher and the plains pocket gopher, members of a separate genus, Geomys, which showed a higher degree of inbreeding.|$|E
5|$|Snakes {{use their}} venom {{to kill or}} subdue prey, {{as well as for}} other diet-related functions, such as digestion. Current {{scientific}} theory suggests that snake venom is not used for defense or for competition between <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> species, unlike in other taxa. Thus adaptive evolution in snake venom has resulted in several adaptations with respect to these diet-related functions that increase the fitness of the snakes that carry them.|$|E

5|$|That there {{potentially}} {{would be}} a lack of continuity between political platforms from a governor of one party and a senate president of another who assumes the post as acting governor. As there was no guarantee the two individuals would be <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> party, there was greater concern that {{the policies of the}} acting governor might be in direct conflict with those of the preceding governor.|$|E
5|$|Tikal's great rival was Calakmul, another {{powerful}} {{city in the}} Petén Basin. Tikal and Calakmul both developed extensive {{systems of}} allies and vassals; lesser cities that entered one of these networks gained prestige from their association with the top-tier city, and maintained peaceful relations with other <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> network. Tikal and Calakmul engaged in the manoeuvering of their alliance networks against each other. At various points during the Classic period, one or other of these powers would gain a strategic victory over its great rival, resulting in respective periods of florescence and decline.|$|E
5|$|Another {{analogous}} case {{within a}} single species has been termed Browerian mimicry (after Lincoln P. Brower and Jane Van Zandt Brower). This {{is a case of}} bipolar (only two species involved) automimicry; the model is the same species as its mimic. Equivalent to Batesian mimicry {{within a single}} species, it occurs when there is a palatability spectrum within a population of harmful prey. For example, monarch (Danaus plexippus) caterpillars feed on milkweed species of varying toxicity. Some feed on more toxic plants, and store these toxins within themselves. The more palatable caterpillars thus profit from the more toxic <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> species.|$|E

5|$|British ornithologist David Lack {{considered}} that the Puerto Rican amazon had {{evolved from the}} Hispaniolan amazon (A. ventralis) found in Hispaniola, but it has since been argued that he omitted some elements in his analysis, including the similarities found between the black-billed amazon (A. agilis) of Jamaica and the Puerto Rican amazon. Subsequent studies showed that size and color patterns were not sufficient to assess evolutionary relationships, and that patterns changed with relative ease even within <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> species. The research concluded that the Puerto Rican amazon may share a common ancestor with the Jamaican A. agilis. Recent phylogenetic {{studies show that the}} Puerto Rican amazon is more closely related to the Hispaniolan amazon and the Cuban amazon than to the black-billed amazon.|$|E
5|$|In some species, {{both parents}} care for nestlings and fledglings; in others, such care is the {{responsibility}} of only one sex. In some species, other <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> species—usually close relatives of the breeding pair, such as offspring from previous broods—will help with the raising of the young. Such alloparenting is particularly common among the Corvida, which includes such birds as the true crows, Australian magpie and fairy-wrens, but has been observed in species as different as the rifleman and red kite. Among most groups of animals, male parental care is rare. In birds, however, it is quite common—more so than in any other vertebrate class. Though territory and nest site defence, incubation, and chick feeding are often shared tasks, there is sometimes a division of labour in which one mate undertakes all or most of a particular duty.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} insects are toxic or distasteful {{when they have}} fed on certain plants that contain {{chemicals}} of particular classes, but not when they have fed on plants that lack those chemicals. For instance, some species of the subfamily Danainae feed on various species of the Asclepiadoideae in the family Apocynaceae, which render them poisonous and emetic to most predators. Such insects frequently are aposematically coloured and patterned. When feeding on innocuous plants however, they are harmless and nutritious, but a bird that once has sampled a toxic specimen is unlikely to eat harmless specimens that have the same aposematic coloration. When regarded as mimicry of toxic <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> species, this too {{may be seen as}} automimicry.|$|E
