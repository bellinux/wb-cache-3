The word [...] "Moko" [...] {{may come from}} the name for a vengeance god in West Africa, where the {{tradition}} originated. Or it may derive from the <b>Macaw</b> <b>tree,</b> a tall palm with thorns - headdresses worn by the Moko-Jumbies {{are said to be}} patterned after a Macaw in bloom. Wearing stilts six to eight feet high, Moko-Jumbies dance to entertain the crowds.|$|E

To supplement feeding observations, we conducted interviews with local residents. Scarlet Macaws fed on seeds, fruits, leaves, flowers and/or bark of 43 plant species. Various plant parts eaten by <b>macaws</b> from several <b>tree</b> species contain secondary compounds toxic to humans, and additional species included in their diet are nonnative, introduced for agricultural purposes. Important <b>macaw</b> feeding <b>tree</b> species are Ceiba pentandra, Schizolobium parahybum, and Hura crepitans; these species are also crucial to this macaw population because of nest cavities they provide. The results of this study contribute to the conservation of Scarlet Macaws in Central Pacific Costa Rica through promoting protection of individual trees, and through local elementary school reforestation programs focusing on <b>tree</b> species that <b>macaws</b> use for feeding and/or nesting. Scarlet Macaw conservation is extremely important, as numerous population pressures have cause...|$|R
50|$|Each of {{the three}} main populations should be managed as a {{separate}} biological entity {{so as to avoid}} numbers dropping below 500. While the birds may be in decline in the wild, notably higher populations of captive macaws are being held in zoos and private collections. If success in managing and replanting the <b>macawâ€™s</b> food <b>trees</b> and erecting nest boxes as an experiment in the Pantanals is seen, the species could survive. Survival rates could also be enhanced if ranch owners would leave all large and potential nest trees standing and eliminate all trapping on their properties. Ultimately, should these factors work in tandem with erection of nest boxes, fencing off of certain saplings, and the planting of others, the long-term prospects of the hyacinth macaw species would be greatly improved.|$|R
50|$|Anodorhynchus is a genus {{of large}} blue macaws from open and semi-open {{habitats}} {{in central and}} eastern South America. It includes two endangered species, the hyacinth macaw and Lear's macaw also known as the indigo macaw, and one probably extinct species, the glaucous macaw. At about 100 cm in length the hyacinth macaw is the longest parrot in the world. Glaucous and Lear's macaws are exclusively cliff nesters; hyacinth <b>macaws</b> are mostly <b>tree</b> nesters. The three species mainly feed on the nuts from a few species of palms (notably Acrocomia aculeata, Attalea phalerata, Butia yatay and Syagrus coronata).|$|R
50|$|The {{festival is}} run over four stages: the Woods Stage, the Garden Stage, the Big Top Stage and the Tipi Tent, {{as well as}} a {{clearing}} in the woods around the Garden Stage containing a piano at which semi-secret sets take place. There are also children's areas and workshops, a healing field, a film tent, comedy, a library in the forest and a games area (ping pong, table football etc.). Due {{to the nature of the}} gardens the festival is set in it is not unlikely to see peacocks wandering around the area and <b>macaws</b> in the <b>trees.</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} food {{items of the}} Blue-and-yellow Macaw (Ara ararauna) flocks foraging at firebreaks in western Cerrado, Brazil. Also, I discuss ecological aspects of macaw feeding activities at firebreaks. Two 3, 500 ha portions of Emas National Park were selected for observations. The sites were mosaics of woodland savanna and shrubby grassland, crossed and bordered by firebreaks and adjacent unsealed roads. A total of 76 foraging flocks of macaws were recorded at firebreaks between September 2006 and February 2007. Seven plant species were identified as food items. Seeds of a shrub species (Anacardium humile) were the most often consumed resource. Parts of other plant species were sometimes consumed. <b>Macaws</b> perched in <b>tree</b> canopies to consume their young apical parts, young leaves, flowers and parts of branches. The frequency of consumption of parts of shrubs {{was significantly higher than}} that of trees. At Emas National Park, numerous Blue-and-yellow Macaw flocks are attracted to firebreaks mainly by fruiting A. humile patches. Their foraging activities often damage reproductive and young parts of shrubs and trees...|$|R
