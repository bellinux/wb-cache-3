5000|$|In the Reduction shaft {{the iron}} ore, along with {{limestone}} and dolomite additives, is added and then reduced by reduction gas into 95% direct reduced iron, DRI. The DRI is then redirected via six discharge screws into the melter-gasifier. The <b>Melter</b> <b>gasifier</b> has three main sections, the gaseous free board zone, the Char bed, and the hearth zone, {{and it has}} an effect on several stages in the process. First it serves to create the reduction gas by gasifying the coal with oxygen and then cooling it. After being reduced, the DRI is redirected to the char bed where the iron and slag are melted and then directed to the hearth zone. [...] The heat inside the metal gasifier keeps the amount of phenols small, keeping them out of the atmosphere. Meanwhile, carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas from the original gasification of the coal exit the gasifier while other byproducts are captured in the metallic slag. The rest of the hot gas is then cooled and sent into the reduction shaft resulting in the Corex export gas which is used to control pressure in the plant. Many of the gases resulting from this process can then be recycled or used to produce electricity. [...] Dust particles also appear in these gases and the <b>Melter</b> <b>gasifier</b> recycles them with four dust burners.|$|E
40|$|A {{dynamic model}} of the COREX <b>melter</b> <b>gasifier</b> is {{developed}} to study the transient behavior of the furnace. The effect of pulse disturbance and step disturbance on the process performance has been studied. This study shows {{that the effect of}} pulse disturbance decays asymptotically. The step change brings the system to a new steady state after a delay of about 5 hours. The dynamic behavior of the <b>melter</b> <b>gasifier</b> with respect to a shutdown/blow-on condition and the effect of tapping are also studied. The results show that the time response of the <b>melter</b> <b>gasifier</b> is much less than that of a blast furnace...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{physical}} {{thermal model}} {{was established in}} this study, and the gas temperature in the model was measured with temperature sensors under different experimental conditions. The {{results show that the}} packed bed, cohesive zone, dripping zone and raceway in <b>melter</b> <b>gasifier</b> can be roughly distinguished by temperature gradient analysis along the vertical direction. The changes of different zones in the COREX <b>melter</b> <b>gasifier</b> were also investigated in this paper under different operation conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{cohesive}} zone plays {{very important role}} in the operation of COREX <b>melter</b> <b>gasifier,</b> up to now, definition of the cohesive boundary has always been a challenging task. In this paper, a two-dimensional hot model of <b>melter</b> <b>gasifier,</b> in which paraffin and corn are used to simulate DRI, coke and lump coal respectively, has been established to study the cohesive boundary in this paper. While the whole experimental process is recorded by the high-speed camera, the image processing method is put forward to define the cohesive boundary quantificationally...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The freeboard, {{which is}} an {{important}} region in COREX <b>melter</b> <b>gasifier,</b> has drawn more and more attentions, and as a key parameter for COREX <b>melter</b> <b>gasifier</b> operation, the temperature in freeboard must be within a certain range. In this paper, the temperature field of freeboard is simulated with computational fluid dynamics(CFD). The {{results show that the}} temperature in bottom is lower than that in upper. The temperature when oxygen nozzles are open is higher than that when oxygen nozzles are off, and the temperature under different operation conditions is all about 1000 Â°C...|$|E
40|$|The COREX <b>melter</b> <b>gasifier</b> is a countercurrent reactor {{to produce}} liquid iron. Directly reduced iron (DRI), noncoking coal, and other {{additives}} are charged to the <b>melter</b> <b>gasifier</b> at their respective temperatures, and O- 2 is blown through the tuyeres. Functionally, a <b>melter</b> <b>gasifier</b> {{is divided into}} three zones: a moving bed, fluidized bed, and free board. A model has been developed for the moving bed, where the tuyere region is two-dimensional (2 -D) and the rest is one-dimensional (1 -D). It is based on multiphase conservation of mass, momentum, and heat. The fluidized bed has been treated as 1 -D. Partial equilibrium is calculated for the free board. The calculated temperature of the hot metal, the top gas, and the chemistry of the top gas agree with the reported plant data. The model has been used to study the effects of bed height, injection of impure O- 2, coal chemistry, and reactivity on the process performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{blast furnace}} is the {{traditional}} iron-making process {{and the most important}} technology to produce the liquid iron. However, with natural resources rapidly depleting and awareness of environmental protection on the rise, new iron-making technologies have been developed {{in the last two decades}} to address the issues. FINEX, the smelting reduction process, is one such promising technology. In recent decades, the mathematical modeling, especially the coupling approach of the discrete particle simulation (DEM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has increasingly become a popular tool to conduct the study of multiphase flows in blast furnaces and COREX processes such as the gas-solid flow, liquid flow and the gas-solid heat transfer. However, no systematic study has been made to examine the FINEX performance. This work aims at achieving a deeper understanding of the FINEX <b>Melter</b> <b>Gasifier</b> using the coupled CFD and DEM. Particle distributors in FINEX <b>Melter</b> <b>Gasifier</b> are simulated first, and the hot compacted iron or HCI split phenomenon, a unique feature observed during particle charging process, has been analyzed. Then 2 D and 3 D DEM models are applied to discuss the particle burden distribution, a deciding factor in the formation of gas flow structure. With the validated 2 D DEM model, the effect of multi-sized particles on gas solid flow has been revealed. The results show that particle bed porosity will be reduced obviously with the use of smaller size particles, and the radial distribution of particle weight in the furnace could be controlled by the ratio of charging particles in the initial charging conditions. To overcome difficulties encountered in applying DEM in heat transfer modeling, a new method had been proposed. After considering different heat loss mechanisms, the temperature field is obtained. Although very little can be found in the literature in this regard, the proportions of the simulated heat loss are reasonable in comparison with the data from a blast furnace. Finally, liquid flow is described using the force balance model. The effects of different variables, such as gas flow rate, solid flow rate, and liquid properties on liquid flow are revealed. The results indicate that liquid flow is strongly influenced by the radial variation of HCI (or hot compacted iron) at the inlet and gas flow in the vicinity of the raceway. Also, the liquid flows could increase the gas velocity and gas pressure gradient near the raceway...|$|E
40|$|Thermogravimetric {{analysis}} of recycling dust (RD) from the <b>melter</b> <b>gasifier</b> of COREX, coke 1 (C- 1), coke 2 (C- 2) and coal char (CC) under 70 % oxygen atmosphere {{was carried out}} using thermal balance. The chemical composition and physical structure of the samples were investigated. The characteristic temperatures and comprehensive combustion characteristic indexes were calculated and kinetic parameters during the combustion process were calculated as well using a distributed activation energy model (DAEM). The {{results show that the}} carbon in the recycling dust originates from unconsumed CC and coke fines, and the average stacking height of carbon in RD is larger than that of C- 1, C- 2 and CC. The conversion curves of RD are different from those of C- 1, C- 2 and CC, and there are two peaks in the RD conversion rate curves. The combustion profiles of RD moves to a higher temperature zone with increasing heating rates. The average activation energies of their combustion process for RD, C- 1, C- 2 and CC range from 191. 84 kJ/mol to 128. 31 kJ/mol. The activation energy for recycling dust increases as the fractional conversion increases, but the value for C- 1, C- 2 and CC decreases with increasing conversion, indicating different combustion mechanisms...|$|E
