5000|$|The waxing and waning of {{the polar}} vortex {{is driven by the}} {{movement}} of mass and the transfer of heat in the polar region. In the autumn, the [...] winds increase in speed and the polar vortex rises into the stratosphere. The result is the polar air forms a coherent rotating air mass: the polar vortex. As winter approaches, the vortex core cools, the winds decrease, and the vortex energy declines. Once late winter and early spring approach the vortex is at its weakest. As a result, during late winter, large fragments of the vortex air can be diverted into lower latitudes by stronger weather systems intruding from those latitudes. In the lowest level of the stratosphere, strong potential vorticity gradients remain, and the majority of that air remains confined within the polar air mass into December in the Southern Hemisphere and April in the Northern Hemisphere, well after the breakup of the vortex in the <b>mid-stratosphere.</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} {{we present a}} case study of a record low ozone event {{observed}} over the UK in January 2006. We focus on the dynamical processes that cause this event. This is done by examining the observations, meteorological analyses and back trajectories calculated by the NAME III atmospheric dispersion model. We show that this model, hitherto only used for tropospheric pollution studies, can be an important and effective tool for the examination of transport in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS) and <b>mid-stratosphere</b> regions. A record low total ozone column of 177 DU was observed at Reading, UK, on 19 January 2006. Low ozone values were also recorded at other stations in Northwest Europe around this date. Ozonesonde measurements indicate the depletion is occurring in two distinct vertical regions, with around a third of the reduction in total ozone column values originating from the <b>mid-stratosphere</b> and the rest from the UTLS region. Evidence suggests that air inside the stratospheric polar vortex was poor in ozone prior to 19 January and the occurrence of a major stratospheric warming shifted this air over Northwest Europe. In addition we show that moderate ozone depletion, related to the lifting of the tropopause and divergence in the lower stratosphere associated with the presence of an anticyclone, is also a plausible mechanism for the record low ozone column that is observed. In order to confirm that both <b>mid-stratosphere</b> and UTLS transport processes are responsible for the record low ozone values, we perform turbulent back trajectory calculations using the Met Office NAME III model. The results show that air parcels in the <b>mid-stratosphere</b> that arrive over the British Isles on 19 January originate in the polar vortex, and furthermore that air parcels near the tropopause arrive from low latitudes and are transported anticyclonically. Therefore this strongly suggests that the record low ozone values are due to a combination of a raised tropopause with increased divergence in the lower stratosphere and the presence of low ozone stratospheric air aloft...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe final warming of the stratospheric {{polar vortex}} {{at the end of}} {{northern}} hemisphere winter is examined in ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis data and an ensemble of chemistry climate models, using 20 years of data from each. In some years the final warming is found to occur first in the <b>mid-stratosphere,</b> and in others to occur first in the upper stratosphere. The strength of the winter {{stratospheric polar vortex}}, refraction of planetary waves, and the altitudes at which the planetary waves break in the northern extratropics lead to this difference in the vertical profile of the final warming. Years in which the final warming occurs first in the <b>mid-stratosphere</b> show, on average, a more negative NAO pattern in April mean sea level pressure than years in which the warming occurs first in the upper stratosphere.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{simulations}} using the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry Climate Model are analyzed {{in order to}} assess changes in the Brewerâ€“Dobson Circulation (BDC) over the past 55 Â years. When trends are computed over the past 55 Â years, the BDC accelerates throughout the stratosphere, consistent with previous modeling results. However, over {{the second half of the}} simulations (i. e., since the late 1980 s), the model simulates structural changes in the BDC as the temporal evolution of the BDC varies between regions in the stratosphere. In the <b>mid-stratosphere</b> in the midlatitude Northern Hemisphere, the BDC does not accelerate in the ensemble mean of our simulations despite increases in greenhouse gas concentrations and warming sea surface temperatures, and it even decelerates in one ensemble member. This deceleration is reminiscent of changes inferred from satellite instruments and in situ measurements. In contrast, the BDC in the lower stratosphere continues to accelerate. The main forcing agents for the recent slowdown in the <b>mid-stratosphere</b> appear to be declining ozone-depleting substance (ODS) concentrations and the timing of volcanic eruptions. Changes in both mean age of air and the tropical upwelling of the residual circulation indicate a lack of recent acceleration. We therefore clarify that the statement that is often made that climate models simulate a decreasing age throughout the stratosphere only applies over long time periods and is not necessarily the case for the past 25 Â years, when most tracer measurements were taken...|$|E

The {{first is a}} large positive O 3 anomaly that occurs in the <b>mid-stratosphere</b> (~ 10 â€“ 30 hPa) in June 2001, which is caused by an anticyclonic circulation that persists for several weeks over Lauder.

Coincident measurements from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) show that these high O 3 mixing ratios are well correlated with high nitrous oxide (N 2 O) mixing ratios. This correlation suggests that the high O 3 over this 4 -year period is driven by unusual dynamics. The beginning of the high O 3 and high N 2 O period at Lauder (and throughout this latitude band) occurs nearly simultaneously with a sharp decrease in O 3 and N 2 O at the equator, and the period ends nearly simultaneously with a sharp increase in O 3 and N 2 O at the equator...|$|E

E. g., years with low wave activity during mid-winter exhibit reduced poleward and downward ozone transport, enhanced confinement of air masses at high latitudes and low temperatures that favour chemical ozone destruction.

40|$|International audienceA record low {{total ozone}} column of 177 DU was {{observed}} at Reading, UK, on 19 January 2006. Low ozone values were also recorded at other stations in the British Isles and North West Europe on, and around, this date. Hemispheric maps of total ozone from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) Ozone Mapping Centre also show the evolution of this ozone minimum from 15 ? 20 January 2006 over North West Europe. Ozonesonde measurements made at Lerwick, UK, show that ozone mixing ratios in the <b>mid-stratosphere</b> on 18 January are around 1 ? 2 ppmv lower than both climatology and observations made one and two weeks prior to this date. In addition, ozone mixing ratios in the UTLS region were also noticeably reduced on 18 January. Analysis of the ozonesonde observations indicate that the <b>mid-stratosphere</b> ozone accounts for around {{a third of the}} reduction in {{total ozone column}} measurements while the UTLS ozone values account for two thirds of the depletion. It is evident from the ozonesonde data that ozone loss is occuring at two distinct vertical regions. Met Office analyses indicate that stratospheric polar vortex temperatures were cold enough for Polar Stratospheric Cloud (PSC) formation during 14 days in January prior to the low ozone event on 19 January. The presence of PSCs is confirmed by observations from the Scanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CartograpHY (SCIAMACHY). As a consequence of a stratospheric sudden warming that was in progress during January 2006, the polar vortex was shifted southwards over northwest Europe. This includes a period from 16 to 19 January where PSCs were present in the vortex over the UK. Throughout most of January suitable conditions were present for ozone destruction by heterogenous chemistry within the polar vortex. Evidence from Lerwick and SodankylÃ¤ ozonesonde profiles, and maps of Ertel's potential vorticity calculated from Met Office analyses, strongly suggests that the air inside the stratospheric vortex was poor in ozone for at least one week prior to 18 January. It is also possible that local chemical destruction of stratospheric ozone further contributed to the record low ozone observed at Reading. A closer examination of the WMO total ozone maps shows that the daily minima are often of synoptic, rather than planetary, scale. This therefore suggests a tropospheric, rather than stratospheric, mechanism for the ozone minima. Moderate total ozone depletion is commonly observed in the northern hemisphere middle and high latitude winter. This depletion is related to the lifting of the tropopause associated with the presence of an upper troposphere/lower stratosphere anticyclone. We show a strong link between the ozone minima in the WMO maps and 100 hPa geopotential height from Met Office analyses, and therefore it appears that this may also be a plausible mechanism for the record low ozone column that is observed. Back trajectories calculated by the Met Office NAME III model show that air parcels in the <b>mid-stratosphere</b> do arrive over the British Isles on 19 January via the polar vortex. The NAME III model results also show that air parcels near the tropopause arrive from low latitudes and are transported anticyclonically. Therefore this strongly suggests that the record low ozone values are due to a combination of a raised tropopause and the presence of low ozone stratospheric air aloft...|$|E

The wintertime {{abundance}} of nitric acid (HNO 3) in the polar upper stratosphere displays a strong inter-annual variability, {{and is known}} to be strongly influenced by ener-getic particle precipitation (EPP), primarily by protons dur-ing solar proton events (SPEs), but also by precipitating au-roral or relativistic electrons.

SMR observations show clear evidence of two different types of polar high-altitude HNO 3 enhancements linked to EPP.

Operational data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts is used to perform the analysis. Restrictions on gravity wave propagation due to model sponge layers are identified well above the 10 â€‰hPa altitude. From a minor stratospheric warming in January 2016 three cases for vertical gravity wave propagation in different background wind conditions are selected. It is shown that zonal mean wind quantities cannot reveal local "valves" allowing gravity waves to propagate into the <b>mid-stratosphere.</b> The unexpected finding of high gravity wave activity at the minor warming of 30 January 2016 is related to strong planetary wave activity and a strong local "pump".

The analysis also shows that only during the month of August (ASM) is moist air pumped into the lower stratosphere over the two key geographical locations (India and Western Pacific). The air parcel from the tropical tropopause takes approximately 10 - 12 months to reach the <b>mid-stratosphere</b> with an ascent rate of 2. 8 Ã— 10 - 4 m s- 1.

Zonal means are also significantly dependent on circulation parameters, besides showing the known negative trend function of total ozone observed by TOMS. The significant linear trend for 60 Â°N is âˆ¼ 3 DU/year in the winter months taking into account the dependence on the dynamics between the tropopause region and the <b>mid-stratosphere.</b> The highest correlation coefficient for the monthly mean total ozone anomalies is reached in November with 0. 94...|$|E
40|$|Verso lâ€™alto is a multi-disciplinary {{undergraduate}} {{research and}} development project whose goal is to gain insight into the upper atmospheric electromagnetic environment above the Southern Appalachian Mountains. Using high altitude weather balloons, Verso lâ€™altos â€™ payload carries scientific and amateur radio equipment in order to record cosmic radiation fluctuations and locate gamma rays that produce terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs). TGFâ€™s commonly form in high electrical fields within and above thunderstorms and snowstorms in the troposphere and tropopause; where they produce a shot of intense gamma radiation that is hurled into space. A high-speed camera is also included within the payload to capture images {{of the region and}} of the lightning in the upper atmosphere. Live tracking and telemetry of the flight is performed by amateur radio, and coordinates are uploaded to aprs. fi for real-time access online. The chase team consists of three licensed mobile amateur radio vehicles and licensed undergraduate amateur radio operators who track and retrieve the payload. This project encourages cooperation between local communities, scientific organizations and academic institutions, in order to better understand the impact of cosmic radiation fluctuations from the ground into the <b>mid-stratosphere,</b> where direct observation is extremely limited. A launch of Verso lâ€™alto was conducted in October 2012 and a second launch is scheduled for December 2012. In the October flight, radio and tracking equipment indicated the balloon rose to an altitude ove...|$|E
