50|$|One of {{the more}} {{significant}} achievements of High End Systems was {{the introduction of the}} DMX-controlled media server called Catalyst in 2002. Up until that point, media servers were manually-operated systems where the media, either tape or video computer files, were switched using a push button matrix switcher or a T-handle switcher to crossfade between sources. In 2000, High End Systems introduced a digital projection system with a video projector, Orbital <b>Mirror</b> <b>Head,</b> and a DMX-controlled media server that interfaced with a lighting console. It allowed a lighting programmer to program the video switching and effects into the lighting console and play them back as part of the light show. The first such system was called Catalyst, but Catalyst evolved into the DMX-controlled media server while the Orbital <b>Mirror</b> <b>Head</b> was marketed alone.|$|E

40|$|Accurately {{predicting}} both {{average flow}} quantities and acoustic sources {{at the front}} window of today's ground vehicles are still a considerable challenge to automotive companies worldwide. One {{of the most important}} aspects in terms of obtaining not only trustworthy results but also the most tedious one and therefore perhaps overlooked, is the control and outcome of the mesh generation process. Generating unstructured volume meshes suitable for large eddy simulations with high level representation of geometrical details is both a time consuming and an extremely computer demanding activity. This work investigates two different mesh generation processes with its main aim to evaluate their outcome with respect to the prediction of the two dominating dipole sources in a temporal form of the Curle's equation. Only a handful of papers exists that report a high level representation of the vehicle geometry and the aim of predicting the fluctuating exterior noise sources. To the author's knowledge no studies have been conducted in which both these source terms are evaluated quantitatively against measurements. The current paper investigates {{the degree to which the}} amplitude of these two source terms can be predicted by using the traditional law-of-the-wall and hex-dominant meshes with isotropic resolution boxes for a detailed ground vehicle geometry. For this purpose, the unstructured segregated commercial FLUENT finite volume method code is used. The flow field is treated as incompressible and the Smagorinsky-Lilly model is used to compute the subgrid stresses. Mean flow quantities are measured with a 14 hole probe for 14 rakes downstream of the side mirror. The dynamic pressure sensors are distributed at 16 different positions over the side window to capture the fluctuating pressure signals. All measurements in this work were conducted at Ford's acoustic wind tunnel in Cologne. All three simulations accurately predict the velocity magnitude closest to the window and downstream of the <b>mirror</b> <b>head</b> recirculation zone. Some variations in the size and shape of this recirculation zone are found between the different meshes, most probably caused by differences in the detachment of the <b>mirror</b> <b>head</b> boundary layer. The Strouhal number of the shortest simulation was computed from the fundamental frequency of the drag force coefficient. The computed Strouhal number agrees well with the corresponding results from similar objects and gives an indication of an acceptable simulation time. The dynamic pressure sensors at 16 different locations at the vehicle side window were also used to capture the levels of the two dipole source terms. These results are compared with the three simulations. With the exception of three positions, at least one of the three simulations accurately captures the levels of both source terms up to about 1000 Hz. The three positions with less agreement as compared with measurements were found to be in regions sensitive to small changes in the local flow direction. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4001340...|$|E
40|$|Symposium CC on Laser and Plasma Processing for Advanced Applications in Material Science {{held during}} the Annual Spring Meeting of the European-Materials-Research-Society (E-MRS), Lille, FRANCE, MAY 11 - 15, 2015 International audienceThe {{development}} of high-speed ink printing process by Laser-Induced Forward Transfer (LIFT) {{is of great}} interest for the printing community. To address the problems and the limitations of this process that have been previously identified, we have performed an experimental study on laser micro-printing of silver nanoparticle inks by LIFT and demonstrated {{for the first time}} the printing of continuous conductive lines in a single pass at velocities of 17 m/s using a 1 MHz repetition rate laser. We investigated the printing process by means of a time-resolved imaging technique to visualize the ejection dynamics of single and adjacent jets. The control of the donor film properties is of prime importance to achieve single step printing of continuous lines at high velocities. We use a 30 ps pulse duration laser with a wavelength of 343 nm and a repetition rate from 0. 2 to 1 MHz. A galvanometric <b>mirror</b> <b>head</b> controls the distance between two consecutives jets by scanning the focused beam along an ink-coated donor substrate at different velocities. Droplets and lines of silver inks are laser-printed on glass and PET flexible substrates and we characterized their morphological quality by atomic force microscope (AFM) and optical microscope.

40|$|One kind of eye {{movement}} tracking device which has great potential is the digital computer-controlled Oculometer, an instrument which non-invasively measures point of regard of the subject, {{as well as}} pupil diameter and blink occurrence. In conjunction with a computer-generated display which can change in real time {{as a function of}} the subject's eye motions, the computer-controlled Oculometer makes possible a variety of interactive measurement and control systems. Practical applications of such schemes have had to await the development of an instrument design which does not inconvenience the subject, and which conveniently interfaces with a digital computer (see ref. 1). This report describes an Oculometer subsystem and an eye-tracking/control program designed for use with the PDP- 6 computer of the MIT Project MAC Artificial Intelligence Group. The oculometer electro-optic subsystem utilizes near-infrared light reflected specularly off the front surface of the subject's cornea and diffusely off the retina, producing a bright pupil with an overriding corneal highlight. An electro-optic scanning aperture vidissector within the unit, driven by a digital eye-tracking algorithm programmed into the PDP- 6 computer, detects and tracks the centers of the corneal highlight and the bright pupil to give eve movement measurements. A computer-controlled, moving <b>mirror</b> <b>head</b> motion tracker directly coupled to the vidissector tracker permits the subject reasonable freedom of movement. Various applications of this system, which are suggested by the work reported here, include; (a) using the eye as a control device, (b) recording eye fixation and exploring patterns, (c) game playing, (d) training machines, and (e) psychophysiological testing and recording...|$|E

In general actual human heads are not symmetric. For example one eye may be slightly higher than the other and a nose maybe somewhat bent. Recently researchers also have evidence of brain torque (i. e. rightward frontal and leftward occipital asymmetry) in humans. In this FDTD model the head is modeled as two identical mirrored halves. By this method the field values need not be calculated twice thereby reducing computation time and memory requirements.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{extends the}} current {{understanding}} of the laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) process to the multi-jets ejection problem. LIFT has already been used to print micrometer-sized droplets from a liquid donor substrate with single pulse experiments. Here we study {{the dynamics of the}} high-speed multi-jets formation from silver nanoparticles ink films with a time-resolved imaging technique. A galvanometric <b>mirrors</b> <b>head</b> controls the spacing between adjacent pulses by scanning the focused beam of a high repetition rate UV picosecond laser along an ink-coated donor substrate. The laser pulses interact with the liquid film and generate cavitation bubbles that propel the ink away from the substrate and form the jets. When the spacing between consecutive pulses is substantially higher than the maximum diameter of the bubbles, there is no interaction between adjacent jets, and these remain unperturbed. However, when the pulses are brought closer significant jet-jet interaction takes place, which results in a clear deviation from the single jet dynamics. Thus, the cavitation bubbles acquire different shapes, the ink is ejected faster and along different directions depending on the spacing between the pulses, and each bubble alters the evolution of the previous one and shifts away from it.

He was paired with Alain Prost, (who was also the reigning World Champion), and who took over as the team's lead driver. Mansell recalls one incident where at the 1990 British Grand Prix, the car he drove did not handle {{the same as in}} the previous race where he had taken pole position. On confronting the mechanics, it transpired that Prost saw Mansell as having a superior car and as a result, they were swapped without telling Mansell. After retiring from the race, he announced he was retiring from the sport altogether {{at the end of the}} season. This, combined with the fact that Frenchman Prost was not only a triple World Champion and the winner of more Grands Prix than anyone in history, but also spoke fluent Italian, whereas Mansell's Italian was only conversational at best, gave Prost greater influence within the Maranello-based team. One notable highlight of the season was a daring pass on Gerhard Berger around the daunting high speed Peraltada corner that was later renamed in his honour. Approaching the corner for the penultimate time Mansell was bobbing from side to side in Bergerâ€™s <b>mirrors.</b> <b>Heading</b> into one of the quickest corners on the calendar at the time, where the Ferraris had registered forces of 4.7g during practice, Mansell launched to the outside of Berger and flashed past to take second place.|$|R
