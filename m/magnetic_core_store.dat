50|$|The DDP-24 was a 24-bit {{computer}} {{designed and}} built by the Computer Control Company, aka 3C or CCC located in Framingham, Massachusetts. CCC consequently became part of Honeywell in 1967. The DDP-24 was completely transistorized and has a sign magnitude code to represent positive or negative numbers. The processor used binary logic. The DDP-24 used a single address command format and single operation with index and indirect addressing flags. The DDP-24 used <b>magnetic</b> <b>core</b> memory to <b>store</b> data and program instructions.

The machine is a medium-speed computer with a magnetic drum memory, and includes a modest <b>magnetic</b> <b>core</b> memory for <b>storing</b> micro-orders. The micro-program feature relates to the command structure of the machine. Micro-orders enable the programmer to specify many of the elementary internal operations; these micro-orders are arranged into micro-routines which synthesize computation sequences equivalent to commands in more conventional computers. Therefore, effectively, the machine has an extremely long command list. Included are descriptions of the internal organization of the machine, and the detailed logical equations which are directly applicable {{to the construction of}} the computer. A few micro-routines, for both usual and uncommon commands, are also shown, to illustrate possible applications of the machine...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The novel soft {{magnetic}} materials and <b>magnetic</b> <b>core</b> structure used in planar transformer have been studied. The frequency, electrical and structure feature of the planar transformer with matrix structure was described. Then the novel {{magnetic materials}} used in the planar transformer were discussed, which were very different from ferrite block. The silicon steel strip was first represented, the magnetic characteristic of which was related to its geometric dimension, working frequency and the component. The microcrystallite alloy and amorphous alloy magnetic materials were then indicated, including iron-base nanocrystal and cobalt-base amorphous alloy. The magnetic materials of the above amorphous alloy and microcrystallite alloy were compared respectively. These {{soft magnetic materials}} {{could be used as}} the <b>magnetic</b> <b>core</b> in planar transformer, and the <b>magnetic</b> <b>core</b> could be composed of thin strip and line.
