In English, the word bank has two applicable meanings {{in the context of this}} sentence (<b>monetary</b> <b>institution</b> and river shore). However, the <b>monetary</b> <b>institution</b> meaning of the word is more highly activated in this context due to the addition of the words robber and money to the sentence, because they are associatively relevant and therefore pull the <b>monetary</b> <b>institution</b> definition for bank into working memory.

Our starting point is that the central bank and rational agents in the private economy interact strategically. The central bank sets monetary policy (usually the rate of inflation) and the private agents rationally form expectations about the rate of inflation. The monetary policy maker has an information advantage {{about the state of the}} economy and in the last part of this book also about its own preferences.

This paper analyses how internal and external exchange rate flexibility affect macroeconomic adjustment in EMU and non-EMU countries. To do so, a model is constructed in which three countries interact: two countries that decide to form a monetary union and a third country that does not participate in the monetary union.
