5|$|Fluoride {{therapy is}} often {{recommended}} {{to protect against}} dental caries. Water fluoridation and fluoride supplements decrease the incidence of dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent dental decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. The incorporated fluoride makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and thus more resistant to decay. Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride toothpaste or <b>mouthwash,</b> is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.|$|E

5|$|Alveolar osteitis is a {{complication}} of tooth extraction (especially lower wisdom teeth) {{in which the}} blood clot is not formed or is lost, leaving the socket where the tooth used to be empty, and bare bone is exposed to the mouth. The pain is moderate to severe, and dull, aching, and throbbing in character. The pain is localized to the socket, and may radiate. It normally starts two to {{four days after the}} extraction, and may last 10–40 days. Healing is delayed, and it is treated with local anesthetic dressings, which are typically required for five to seven days. There is some evidence that chlorhexidine <b>mouthwash</b> used prior to extractions prevents alveolar osteitis.|$|E

40|$|Candida albicans is {{the most}} common cause of oral mycoses. The aim of the present study was to {{investigate}} in vitro the susceptibility of C. albicans to <b>mouthwashes,</b> in terms of growth, survival and biofilm formation. Candida albicans, laboratory strain SC 5314, and 7 commercial <b>mouthwashes</b> were employed: 3 with 0. 2 % chlorhexidine digluconate; 1 with 0. 06 % chlorhexidine digluconate and 250 ppm F sodium fluoride; 3 with fluorine-containing molecules. None of the <b>mouthwashes</b> contained ethanol in their formulations. The anti-Candida effects of the <b>mouthwashes</b> were assessed by disk diffusion, crystal violet and XTT assays. By using five protocols combining different dilutions and contact times the <b>mouthwashes</b> were tested against: 1) C. albicans growth; 2) biofilm formation; 3) survival of fungal cells in early, developing and mature Candida biofilm. Chlorhexidine digluconate-containing <b>mouthwashes</b> consistently exhibited the highest anti-Candida activity, irrespective of the protocols employed. Fungal growth, biofilm formation and survival of Candida cells within biofilm were impaired, the effects strictly depending on both the dilution employed and the time of contact. These in vitro studies provide evidence that <b>mouthwashes</b> exert anti-Candida activity against both planktonic and biofilm fungal structures, but to a different extent depending on their composition. This suggests special caution in the choice of <b>mouthwashes</b> for oral hygiene, whether aimed at prevention or treatment of oral candidiasis...|$|R
40|$|Introduction : Candida albicans {{has been}} {{isolated}} {{in up to}} 65 % of healthy individuals without signs of clinical disease. <b>Mouthwashes</b> {{can be used for}} many preventative and therapeutic purposes. This study evaluates the effectiveness of Iranian and foreign <b>mouthwashes</b> against C. albicans as a common fungal flora in the mouth.   Materials and method s: In this research, standard strain of C. albicans, ATCC 10231 is used. The suspension is provided by a fresh culture of C. albicans (24 hours) and the OD is read in 530 nm. The C. albicans suspension was cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar plate. In the next step, two wells created on SDA, filling with <b>mouthwashes</b> (100 µl). After incubation at 37 ºC for 24 hours, the inhibition zone was measured. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and Minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of <b>mouthwashes</b> were determined. The data are analyzed by SPSS software, independent T-tests and one sided variance analysis (ANOVA-one way).   Results : Findings of our study showed in which agar diffusion, MIC and MFC tests, there are {{no significant differences between the}} antifungal effect of the Iranian and foreign <b>mouthwashes</b> on C. albicans (P value> 0. 05).   Discussion and conclusion : This study shows that both Iranian and foreign <b>mouthwashes</b> have a good effect against C. albicans, as a common fungal flora in the mouth...|$|R
5|$|Discoloration {{of teeth}} {{may result from}} {{bacteria}} stains, tobacco, tea, coffee, foods {{with an abundance of}} chlorophyll, restorative materials, and medications. Stains from bacteria may cause colors varying from green to black to orange. Green stains also result from foods with chlorophyll or excessive exposure to copper or nickel. Amalgam, a common dental restorative material, may turn adjacent areas of teeth black or gray. Long term use of chlorhexidine, a <b>mouthwash,</b> may encourage extrinsic stain formation near the gingiva on teeth. This is usually easy for a hygienist to remove. Systemic disorders also can cause tooth discoloration. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria causes porphyrins to be deposited in teeth, causing a red-brown coloration. Blue discoloration may occur with alkaptonuria and rarely with Parkinson's disease. Erythroblastosis fetalis and biliary atresia are diseases which may cause teeth to appear green from the deposition of biliverdin. Also, trauma may change a tooth to a pink, yellow, or dark gray color. Pink and red discolorations are also associated in patients with lepromatous leprosy. Some medications, such as tetracycline antibiotics, may become incorporated into the structure of a tooth, causing intrinsic staining of the teeth.|$|E

25|$|A 2003 {{episode of}} the science {{television}} show MythBusters tested a number of methods that supposedly allow a person to fool a breath analyzer test. The methods tested included breath mints, onions, denture cream, <b>mouthwash,</b> pennies and batteries; all of these methods proved ineffective. The show noted that using these items to cover the smell of alcohol may fool a person, but, since they will not actually reduce a person's BrAC, {{there will be no}} effect on a breath analyzer test regardless of the quantity used, if any, it appeared that using <b>mouthwash</b> only raised the BrAC.

25|$|Treatment is cause-related, {{but also}} {{symptomatic}} if {{the underlying cause}} is unknown or not correctable. It {{is also important to}} note that most ulcers will heal completely without any intervention. Treatment can range from simply smoothing or removing a local cause of trauma, to addressing underlying factors such as dry mouth or substituting a problem medication. Maintaining good oral hygiene and use of an antiseptic <b>mouthwash</b> or spray (e.g. chlorhexidine) can prevent secondary infection and therefore hasten healing. A topical analgesic (e.g. benzydamine <b>mouthwash)</b> may reduce pain. Topical (gels, creams or inhalers) or systemic steroids may be used to reduce inflammation. An antifungal drug may be used to prevent oral candidiasis developing in those who use prolonged steroids. People with mouth ulcers may prefer to avoid hot or spicy foods, which can increase the pain. Self-inflicted ulceration can be difficult to manage, and psychiatric input may be required in some people.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Oral {{candidiasis}} is {{a frequent}} opportunistic fungal infection, occurring especially in susceptible individuals. This pathology, mainly associated with Candida albicans species, may be prevented by a good oral hygiene, the daily use of toothbrush and <b>mouthwashes.</b> Among several virulence factors, C. albicans {{has the ability to}} switch from yeast-to-hyphal forms and to produce biofilm, thus contrasting antimicrobial agents and host immune defences as well [1 - 3]. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the susceptibility of C. albicans, in terms of growth, hyphal formation and biofilm production/persistence, to <b>mouthwashes</b> with different composition.

25|$|Practice of good {{oral hygiene}} {{including}} daily brushing, flossing {{and the use}} of appropriate <b>mouthwash</b> can significantly reduce the number of oral bacteria, including S. mutans and inhibit their proliferation. S. mutans often live in dental plaque, hence mechanical removal of plaque is an effective way of getting rid of them. However, there are some remedies used in the treatment of oral bacterial infection, in conjunction with mechanical cleaning. These include Fluoride, which has a direct inhibitory effect on the enolase enzyme, as well as Chlorhexidine, which works presumably by interfering with bacterial adherence.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the aforementioned treatments, there are also many management approaches that can alleviate the symptoms of dysgeusia. These include using non-metallic silverware, avoiding metallic or bitter tasting foods, increasing the consumption of foods high in protein, flavoring foods with spices and seasonings, serving foods cold {{in order to reduce}} any unpleasant taste or odor, frequently brushing one's teeth and utilizing <b>mouthwash,</b> or using sialogogues such as chewing sugar-free gum or sour-tasting drops that stimulate the productivity of saliva. When taste is impeded, the food experience can be improved through means other than taste, such as texture, aroma, temperature, and color.|$|E
