It is one the next diseases targeted for eradication by the World Health Organization. Guinea <b>worm</b> <b>disease</b> is transmitted by drinking water containing copepods (water fleas) that are infected with Dracunculiasis medinensis larvae. One year after human ingestion of infected water a female adult worm emerges, typically from a lower extremity, producing painful ulcers that can impair mobility for up to several weeks. This disease occurs annually when agricultural activities are at their peak. Large proportions of economically productive individuals of a village are usually affected simultaneously, resulting in decreased agricultural productivity and economic hardship. Eradication of guinea <b>worm</b> <b>disease</b> depends on prevention, as there is no effective treatment or vaccine. Since 1986, there has been a 98 % reduction in guinea <b>worm</b> <b>disease</b> worldwide, achieved primarily through community-based programs. These programs have educated local populations on how to filter drinking water to remove the parasite and how to prevent those with ulcers from infecting drinking-water sources.
