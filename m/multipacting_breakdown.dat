40|$|The {{vacuum system}} of the PLS 2 -GeV linac has been {{operating}} continuously for the last 4 years since its commissioning. It has been stabilized after the successful correction of initial phase troubles including the over-temperature and the communication failure of the ion pump controllers and the ceramic window leaks. And then, the down time is mainly caused by the replacement of a klystron and a microwave dummy load due to the long recovery time through the microwave conditioning. A stable operation is occasionally perturbed by a few hour <b>multipacting</b> <b>breakdown.</b> The present availability of the vacuum system is 99. 8 % in 1997. This paper presents the overall availability analysis and describes major troubles of the PLS linac vacuum system. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Current NASA {{studies of}} Space Solar Power Systems for {{delivery}} from GEO of electric power at 5. 8 GHz envision {{use of a}} 500 m diameter phased array transmitting of order 2 GW to yield 1. 2 GWe output to the electric grid from Earth based rectenna arrays. Phase injection-locked magnetron directional amplifiers (MDA) are one approach for the DC to RF converters on the beamer. This approach is based on earlier work by Bill Brown. The key element {{of the system is}} the proposed 5 kW output 85. 5 % efficient, 6 kV MDA with pyrolytic graphite thermal radiator operating at 350 C. Slotted waveguide transmitting antennas are also proposed and their low-cost manufacture and <b>multipacting</b> <b>breakdown</b> margins under 25 kW/m 2 power flux density {{in the center of the}} 10 dB Gaussian tapered aperture are discussed. An average specific areal mass density goal of 35 kg/m 2 is proposed. EMC issues regarding the close-in carrier noise and harmonic levels are discussed. Grating lobe level maintenance requirements are discussed in regards to the few arc minutes allowed tilt of the entire array, slightly larger arc minute tilts of the individual 4 m subarrays, and maximum allowed random failures of about 2 % of the subarrays.

40|$|Two {{methods can}} be used to {{suppress}} multipacting in a rectangular coupler waveguide. The slotted waveguide method calls for opening slots on the broad walls in the wave propagation direction that perturb the resonance and trap multipacting electrons. The DC magnetic bias method utilizes a solenoid coil wrapped around the waveguide to generate a mild DC magnetic field in the waveguide space that bends the trajectory of multipacting electrons. Electron stimulated desorption plays a critical role in the dynamics of <b>multipacting</b> induced <b>breakdown.</b> Ionization discharge of desorbed gases is the direct cause for RF breakdown. Adequate pumping for the coupler waveguide is essential for a smooth operation...|$|R
40|$|Multipacting induced {{discharge}} in {{a rectangular}} waveguide is studied experimentally at a RF frequency of 500 MHz. The waveguide has {{a cross-section of}} 457 mm by 102 mm. The maximum forward RF power is 600 and 300 kW in traveling and standing wave mode, respectively. A continuous multipacting band structure is observed. Electron pick-up probes of antenna-type are {{used to measure the}} multipacting current and its longitudinal as well as horizontal distributions. The electron energy spectrum is measured with the retarding field method. The end-point energy of the spectra taken in traveling wave mode is in the range of 100 - 1000 eV and agrees well with the impact energy calculated by the classical multipacting theory. However, a large fraction of electrons has energies lower than 100 eV. Electron stimulated gas desorption is found to {{play a critical role in}} the dynamics of <b>multipacting</b> induced <b>breakdown.</b> It is concluded that the ionization discharge of desorbed gases is the immediate cause for RF breakdown.

40|$|<b>Multipacting</b> {{can cause}} <b>breakdown</b> in high power rf {{components}} like couplers, windows, etc. This phenomenon starts if certain resonant conditions for electron trajectories are fulfilled {{and if the}} impacted surface has a secondary yield larger than one. A general cure against multipacting is to avoid the resonant conditions. Therefore we investigated {{the dynamics of the}} electron trajectories in order to find rules for these resonances and thus suppress multipacting by appropriate design. We developed a new code which combines standard trajectory calculations with advanced searching and analyzing methods for multipacting resonances. As a first step, coaxial power lines are investigated. We characterize multipacting behavior in straight and tapered lines and give scaling laws with respect to dimension, frequency and impedance. The calculations are compared with experimental observations. I. INTRODUCTION This paper gives a brief description of a code developed for analyzing multipacting in [...] ...|$|R
