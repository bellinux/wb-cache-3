40|$|Capsule’’: The {{primary role}} of {{microbes}} in the potentially substantial mobilization of trace elements from wastewater sludge {{appears to be}} that of acidification. Leaching of sludge-borne trace elements has been observed in experimental and field studies. The role of microbial processes in the mobilization of trace elements from wastewater sludge is poorly defined. Our objectives were to determine trace element mobilization from sludge subjected to treatments representing <b>microbial</b> <b>acidification,</b> direct chemical acidification and no acidification, and to determine the readsorption potential of mobilized elements using calcareous sand. Triplicate columns (10 -cm diameter) for incubation and leaching of sludge had a top layer of digested dewatered sludge (either untreated, acidified with H 2 SO 4, or limed with CaCO 3; all mixed with glass beads to prevent ponding) and a lower glass bead support bed. Glass beads in the sludge layer, support layer or both were replaced by calcareous sand in four treatments used for testing the readsorption potential of mobilized elements. Eight sequential 8 -day incubation and leaching cycles were operated, each consisting of 7. 6 d of incubation at 28 (C followed by 8 h of leaching with synthetic acid rain applied at 0. 25 cm/h. Leachates were analyzed for trace elements, nitrate and pH, and sludge layer microbial respiration was measured. The largest trace element, nitrate and S losses occurred in treatments with the greatest pH depression and greatest microbial respiration rates. Cumulative leaching losses from both <b>microbial</b> <b>acidification</b> and direct acidification treatments wereO 90 % of Zn and 64 e 80 % of Cu and Ni. Preventing acidification with sludg...|$|E
40|$|The endophytic, mantle-inhabiting and rhizosphere-inhabiting {{microorganisms}} {{associated with}} ectomycorrhizal roots {{have been studied}} for over 100 years, but a surprising amount of the information obtained prior to the mid- 1980 ’s is difficult to access and understand. In large part, this is because research investigating local ecosystems and silvicultural practices was often considered regional in nature. It tended to be written up in many different languages and {{to be published in}} journals that were not widely distributed. After 1985, this scientific isolationism was broken up by the ubiquitous trend towards impact factor measurement and international publishing. The goal of the present review is to make still-relevant information from the pre- 1985 ectomycorrhizosphere literature, especially its more strongly obscured elements, readily accessible to modern researchers. Also, some publications that fell into relative obscurity for historical reasons – in particular, studies seeming to reflect the brief association of Soviet mycorrhizal research of the early 1950 ’s with the Lamarckian plant improvement ideas of T. D. Lysenko – are re-examined from current perspectives. The scattered data reveal considerable coherence despite the high ecological diversity they reflect. Endophytes such as members of the Mycelium radicis atrovirens complex – most prominently the species now known as Phialocephala fortinii – feature especially prominently in this area of study, and they received considerable attention beginning in the very early years of the 20 th century. They were variously interpreted as potential symbionts or weak pathogens, an ambiguity that continues to the present day for many of these taxa despite the recent molecular clarification of species and population boundaries. The predominance of P. fortinii and other (normally) non-mycorrhizal “dark (or hyaline) sterile endophyte” fungi from stringently washed or surface-disinfected ectomycorrhizae in most ecosystems was shown repeatedly beginning with the studies of Elias Melin in the early 1920 ’s. The adjacent rhizosphere soil typically contained sporulating fungi dominated by Penicillium, Umbelopsis and Mortierella species, sometimes accompanied by Trichoderma spp., Cylindrocarpon destructans, and various other microfungi. Microbiological investigations into whether ectomycorrhizae exerted a positive “rhizosphere effect” on numbers of fungal propagules in the surrounding soil showed that such effects were often less prominent in natural forests than in planted forests. Several studies showed a general reduction in microbial activity in the zone of ectomycorrhizal influence, and a particularly strong inhibition of soil organisms was shown in the symbiorhizosphere of Tricholoma matsutake and members of the genus Tuber. In relation to such cases, the adoption by mycologists of M. Ogawa’s term “shiro”, (castle, fortress) for the delimited, three-dimensional analogue of a fairy ring formed in soil by many ectomycorrhizal mycobionts is advocated. As relatively highly co-adapted communities, ectomycorrhizosphere organisms appeared to aid in root disease control, in part by harmlessly stimulating roots to produce defensive tannic materials. The production of these materials then appeared to favour the predominance of tannin-degrading Penicillium species in the rhizosphere. Rhizosphere inhabitants were shown to be involved in many types of nutrient and growth factor exchanges, but perhaps to be most important as solubilizers of refractory nutrients like inorganic phosphorus compounds and complex proteinaceous materials. Some potential pathogens like Fusarium spp. tended to be excluded from established forest soils, while Cylindrocarpon destructans, if present, tended to be confined to lower soil regions by <b>microbial</b> <b>acidification</b> of the upper soil zones. The complexity of microfungal communities and their known and potential interactions was high, and seemingly contradictory results often needed to be rationalized, e. g., Trichoderma spp. appeared to be favoured in the root zone in some ecosystems and partially excluded in others, and seemed to abet mycorrhiza formation and tree growth in some habitats but to cause damage to seedlings and mycorrhizal inoculum both in vitro and in the nursery. Modern techniques and bioinformatics methodologies will be needed to make progress towards understanding this complexity, but the multilingual and sometimes overlooked pre- 1985 studies provide a very strong initial basis supporting further development...|$|E
40|$|The {{extensive}} use of wheat bran as a food ingredient is limited due to its bitter taste and hard texture. To overcome these, some preprocessing methods, such as fermentation with yeast and lactic acid bacteria or enzymatic treatments have been proposed. The current work studied <b>microbial</b> communities, <b>acidification,</b> ethanol formation and metabolite profile of wheat bran fermented in either aerated or anaerobic conditions. In aerated conditions, yeasts grew better {{and the production of}} organic acids was smaller, and hence pH was higher. In anaerobic conditions, lactic acid bacteria and endogenous heterotrophic bacteria grew better. Aeration had a large effect on the sourdough metabolite profile, as analyzed by UPLC-qTOF-MS. Anaerobic conditions induced degradation of ferulic and caffeic acids, whereas the amount of sinapic acid increased. Aeration caused degradation of amino acids and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives of polyamines. The results suggest that the control of oxygen could be used for tailoring the properties of bran sourdough. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|The {{repair of}} these micro-cracks is {{believed}} to occur by a micro-callus formation triggered by calcium phosphate leading {{to the creation of}} mineralized bone. However, in the case of any inflammation or <b>microbial</b> invasion, if <b>acidification</b> occurs, this process may get delayed [8]. Additionally, bone necrosis has also been suggested due to heat generation at a critical temperature of 47  °C for 1  min on frictional contact of bone with MSI [9, 10]. In temperatures above this, the secondary stability of MSIs gets compromised due to denaturation of proteins leading to cell death. Understanding the host factors at PI bony interface is thus imperative to ensure the secondary stability of implants, for which the biomarkers released in PMICF play a very significant role.|$|R
40|$|Proto-cooperation between Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus {{is one of}} the {{key factors}} that {{determine}} the fermentation process and final quality of yoghurt. In this study, the interaction between different proteolytic strains of S. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricuswas investigated in terms of <b>microbial</b> growth, <b>acidification</b> and changes in the biochemical composition of milk during set-yoghurt fermentation. A complementary metabolomics approach was applied for global characterization of volatile and non-volatile polar metabolite profiles of yoghurt associated with proteolytic activity of the individual strains in the starter cultures. The results demonstrated that only non-proteolytic S. thermophilus (Prt-) strain performed proto-cooperation with L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. The proto-cooperation resulted in significant higher populations of the two species, faster milk acidification, significant abundance of aroma volatiles and non-volatile metabolites desirable for a good organoleptic quality of yoghurt. Headspace SPME-GC/MS and 1 H NMR resulted in the identification of 35 volatiles and 43 non-volatile polar metabolites, respectively. Furthermore, multivariate statistical analysis allows discriminating set-yoghurts fermented by different types of starter cultures according to their metabolite profiles. Our finding underlines that selection of suitable strain combinations in yoghurt starters is important for achieving the best technological performance regarding the quality of product...|$|R
40|$|Yogurt is popularly {{consumed}} {{because of}} its high digestibility, refreshing organoleptic properties and the healthy bacteria it contains. Milk incubated with starter culture (SC) at 41 ⁰C {{in the presence of}} plants (Momordica grosvenori, Psidium guajava, Lycium barbarum or Garcinia mangostana) water extract were studied to examine the effects on <b>acidification,</b> <b>microbial</b> growth, gelation and exopolysaccharide (EPS) content. Initial pH values (5. 8 - 6. 2) of the mixture of milk, plant water extract and SC were not different (p> 0. 05) from control (6. 20; mixture of milk and SC). The rates of pH reduction for all herbal-yogurts (- 0. 40 pH unit/ hour), except G. mangostana and M. grosvenori (- 0. 33 and - 0. 32 respectively pH unit/hr) was similar to control (- 0. 43 pH unit/ hr) during the first 4 hours of incubation.

40|$|After {{isolation}} from different doughs and sourdoughs, 177 strains of {{lactic acid bacteria}} were screened at the phenotypic level for exopolysaccharide production on media containing different carbohydrate sources. Two exopolysaccharide-producing lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus curvatus 69 B 2 and Leuconostoc lactis 95 A) were selected through quantitative analysis on solid media containing sucrose and yeast extract. The PCR detection of homopolysaccharide (gtf and lev) and heteropolysaccharide (epsA, epsB, epsD and epsE, and epsEFG) genes showed different distributions within species and strains of the lactic acid bacteria studied. Moreover, in some strains both homopolysaccharide and heteropolysaccharide genes were detected. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra suggest that Lactobacillus curvatus 69 B 2 and Leuconostoc lactis 95 A produced the same exopolysaccharide, which was constituted by a single repeating glucopyranosyl unit linked by an alpha-(1 -> 6) glycosidic bond in a dextran-type carbohydrate. <b>Microbial</b> growth, <b>acidification,</b> and viscoelastic properties of sourdoughs obtained by exopolysaccharide-producing and nonproducing lactic acid bacterial strains were evaluated. Sourdough obtained after 15 h at 30 C with exopolysaccharide-producing lactic acid bacteria reached higher total titratable acidity as well as elastic and dissipative modulus curves {{with respect to the}} starter not producing exopolysaccharide, but they showed similar levels of pH and microbial growth. On increasing the fermentation time, no difference in the viscoelastic properties of exopolysaccharide-producing and nonproducing samples was observed. This study suggests that dextran-producing Leuconostoc lactis 95 A and Lactobacillus curvatus 69 B 2 can be employed to prepare sourdough, and this would be particularly useful {{to improve the quality of}} baked goods while avoiding the use of commercially available hydrocolloids as texturizing additives...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} part of our cultural heritage consists of paper materials, which are stored in archives and libraries. Deterioration of written cultural relics is attributed to several causes, such as <b>microbial</b> contamination, oxidation, <b>acidification,</b> and others. It is therefore desirable to focus research activities on conservation and restoration techniques to develop appropriate treatments. A new technology in the field of restoration could be plasma treatment, which is a well-established technique {{in a number of other}} processes, such as plasma cleaning, etching and coating. The main aim of this project is the removal of microbial contamination combined with an increase in paper strength using a plasma-based treatment. Therefore, a special after-glow plasma reactor was constructed to enable careful paper treatment. Current experiments work with oxidising and reducing process-gases to treat naturally aged groundwood paper. A positive effect on the paper stability was achieved by varying treatment parameters, such as flow, pressure, power and time. An overall increase in paper stability of up to 20 % was possible. Parallel investigations using plasma treatment for microbial cleaning were carried out. Certain amounts of different fungi and bacteria were spread on naturally aged paper. After plasma treatment, the reduction in microorganisms was measured. This proved the fungicidal and bactericidal action of the after-glow plasma treatment. Nevertheless, optimisation with regard to different microorganisms and kinds of papers must be considered...|$|R
40|$|This work {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} whether different microbial assemblies in flour may influence the microbiological and biochemical characteristics of traditional sourdough. To reach this purpose, members of lactic acid bacteria, enterobacteria, and yeasts were isolated from durum wheat flour. Secondly, the isolated microorganisms (Pediococcus pentosaceus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pantoea agglomerans, and Escherichia hermanni) were inoculated in doughs prepared with irradiated flour (gamma rays at 10 kGy), so that eight different microbial assemblies were obtained. Two non-inoculated controls were prepared, one of which (C-IF) using irradiated flour and the other (C) using non-irradiated flour. As shown by plate counts, irradiation of flour caused total inactivation of yeasts and a decrease {{of all the other}} <b>microbial</b> populations. However <b>acidification</b> occurred also in the dough C-IF, due to metabolic activity of P. pentosaceus that had survived irradiation. After six fermentations, P. pentosaceus was the dominant lactic acid bacterium species in all the sourdoughs produced with irradiated flour (IF). Yet, IF-based sourdoughs broadly differed from each other in terms of strains of P. pentosaceus, probably due to the different microorganisms initially inoculated. Quantitative and qualitative differences of free amino acids concentration were found among the sourdoughs, possibly because of different microbial communities. In addition, as shown by culture-independent analysis (16 S metagenetics), irradiation of flour lowered and modified microbial diversity of sourdough ecosystem...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between pH and the abundance and activity of bacteria in streams was examined {{as part of}} a study of the effect of acidification on stream communities. Of the bacterial communities examined, the epilithic community appeared to be the most significantly affected by <b>acidification.</b> <b>Microbial</b> biomass, as quantified by measuring the ATP level, on rock surfaces was significantly correlated with pH. Also, bacterial production by the epilithic bacteria, indicated by incorporation of tritiated thymidine into DNA, was always higher at high-pH sites than at low-pH sites of the same stream order and elevation. Bacterioplankton concentrations varied between 0. 53 × 105 and 9. 42 × 105 cells · ml− 1 in the first- to fourth-order streams examined. The bacterioplankton concentration in one sample from a spring was 0. 17 × 105 cells · ml− 1. Bacterioplankton concentrations were not correlated with pH but were significantly correlated with seston concentrations. The correlation with seston is a result of increases in particle-associated bacteria at high seston concentrations. The proportion of bacterioplankton attached to particles varied from 0 to 70 %. Bacterial numbers and production in the sediments were significantly correlated with the organic content of the sediment rather than with the pH of the overlying water. Thus, reduced abundance and activity of bacteria as a result of acidification could be detected only for the relatively active community on rock surfaces; this community was exposed to the low pH because of the unbuffered nature of its environment...|$|R
40|$|Although it is {{recognized}} that acidification of freshwater systems results in decreased overall species richness {{of plants and}} animals, {{little is known about}} the response of aquatic <b>microbial</b> communities to <b>acidification.</b> In this study we examined bacterioplankton community diversity and structure in 18 lakes located in the Adirondack Park (in the state of New York in the United States) that were affected to various degrees by acidic deposition and assessed correlations with 31 physical and chemical parameters. The pH of these lakes ranged from 4. 9 to 7. 8. These studies were conducted as a component of the Adirondack Effects Assessment Program supported by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. Thirty-one independent 16 S rRNA gene libraries consisting of 2, 135 clones were constructed from epilimnion and hypolimnion water samples. Bacterioplankton community composition was determined by sequencing and amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis of the clone libraries. Nineteen bacterial classes representing 95 subclasses were observed, but clone libraries were dominated by representatives of the Actinobacteria and Betaproteobacteria classes. Although the diversity and richness of bacterioplankton communities were positively correlated with pH, the overall community composition assessed by principal component analysis was not. The strongest correlations were observed between bacterioplankton communities and lake depth, hydraulic retention time, dissolved inorganic carbon, and nonlabile monomeric aluminum concentrations. While there was not an overall correlation between bacterioplankton community structure and pH, several bacterial classes, including the Alphaproteobacteria, were directly correlated with acidity. These results indicate that unlike more identifiable correlations between acidity and species richness for higher trophic levels, controls on bacterioplankton community structure are likely more complex, involving both direct and indirect processes...|$|R
40|$|M. Sc. (Chemistry) Volatile {{fatty acids}} (VFAs) play a pivotal {{in the process}} of {{nutrient}} removal by biological processes particularly the enhanced biological nutrient removal process with a side-stream elutriation process using activated sludge. These acids are said to act as intermediates which provide feed for the organisms in a biological phosphorus and nitrogen removal (BNPR) system, such as phosphorus-accumulating organisms (PAOs) and nitrate-accumulating bacteria (NABs). In wastewater treatment plants, VFAs play a vital role as intermediate organic compounds during the fermentation processes which generate methane gas and when present at elevated levels they are known to cause <b>microbial</b> stress, <b>acidification</b> as well as the poor performance of anaerobic digesters. For these reasons, the routine monitoring of VFA levels in wastewater treatment plants is crucial as they will act as indicators of the efficiency and optimal operation performance of the anaerobic digesters. Normally the VFAs that are commonly produced during the anaerobic fermentation process include acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and valeric acid and of these, acetic and propionic acids form the major VFAs that are generated, thus the yields of these two compounds provide a useful measure of the anaerobic digester performance. For example, the ratio of propionic acid to acetic acid is always used as an indicator of digester imbalance while high concentrations of acetic acid (e. g. > 800 mg/ℓ) or a propionic acid to acetic acid ratio greater than 1. 4 is an indication of digester failure. This study was thus aimed at establishing the complete VFA profile at the Johannesburg Water (JW) Northern Works Wastewater Treatment Plant in Johannesburg, South Africa, by developing analytical methods to quantify the VFAs in the wastewater treatment plant. In addition, the level of VFAs quantified was used to evaluate the efficiency of the fermentation treatment process in wastewater treatment systems in order to give an indication of the bacterial activities in the systems; to determine the ratios of the VFAs, especially the propionic acid to acetic acid ratio, to establish the performance and efficiency of various wastewater treatment plants; and to determine whether there is any imbalance in the anaerobic digesters. Two analytical methods for the determination of VFAs were successfully developed and applied to real wastewater samples. The first method developed was a liquid-liquid extraction method using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS. The method involved two extracting solvents, namely dichloromethane (DCM) and methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE). The extraction capacity of these two solvents was compared. The second method successfully developed and optimised headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) using GC-TOF-MS. The microextraction fibre used was a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fibre. Studies to validate the developed methods were also carried out by calculating the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ). Ratios of propionic acid to acetic acids were determined as well as the concentrations of acetic acid for both developed methods in order to evaluate the performance and efficiency of the treatment process. The results of the study show that the extraction procedure using solvents DCM and MTBE showed that exhaustive extraction was achieved by MTBE. Higher concentrations of acetic acid and propionic acid were obtained by MTBE. The overall fermentation performance for all three units in the period when the samples were collected, which was measured by the ratio of propionic to acetic acid was good since the ratio did not exceed 1. 4. The acetic acid concentration in mg/ℓ was < 800 mg/ℓ for all units thus {{it can be said that}} the reactor balance was maintained for the period studied. The method LOD ranged from 0. 034 mg/ℓ to 0. 21 mg/ℓ and the method LOQ ranged from 0. 11 mg/ℓ to 0. 70 mg/ℓ. Optimisation of extraction parameters was achieved for headspace solid-phase microextraction using the PDMS fibre method. The extraction method was conducted for 60 min using a sample volume of 4 mℓ and the amount of sodium salt added was 1. 50 g. The desorption temperature and time was 210 ºC and 5 min, respectively. The LOD values ranged from 0. 079 to 2. 07. The PDMS fibre was found to be suitable for extracting higher carbon chain fatty acids as compared to lower carbon chain fatty acids. The plant performance for the period studied was on par as indicated by ratios of propionic acid to acetic acid which all fell below 1. 4. There were no digester failures for the period studied. The acetic acid concentration in mg/ℓ was < 800 mg/ℓ for all 3 units...|$|R
