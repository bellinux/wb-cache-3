25|$|While {{reading the}} Ramayana, one day young Bhupen {{learned that the}} heroic Lakshmana owed his <b>mom</b> <b>to</b> his control of impulses (brahmacharya). Having asked his mother what it meant, he {{declared}} that he would follow brahmachmom, which he did throughout his life of a bachelor, dedicated {{to the service of}} fellow creatures. He joined Anushilan Samiti in his Faridpur Government High School days, drawn by its humanitarian activities and its anti-Partition agitations since 1905. The study of the Bhagavad Gita and of works by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay and Vivekananda opened before him the path he wanted to follow.|$|E

Theron described Mary, [...] "She makes this conscious decision to live in suburbia and be this soccer <b>mom</b> <b>to</b> her stepson and be the perfect wife—she lives in this bubble. But when people do that it usually means they are hiding some characteristic inside themselves that scares them. That is Mary's case. She knows who she is and what she is capable of." ...|$|E
500|$|Cartman is {{sensitive}} and {{in denial about}} his obesity. Often reasserting Liane's notion by exclaiming [...] "I'm not fat, I'm big-boned!" [...] and will just as often either threaten to bring harm to anyone who mocks his weight or curse them out in aggravation. He has also had people killed, such as when he drove his psychiatrist's wife to suicide after enduring a long tirade about his weight. He views himself as more mature than his fellow friends and classmates, and often grows impatient with their company; despite claiming to be more mature, he will often break down crying childishly and pathetically whenever he feels defeated. This often leads to loud arguments, which in earlier seasons typically end with Cartman peevishly saying [...] "Screw you guys... I'm going home!" [...] and then leaving. In an action King's College philosophy professor David Kyle Johnson describes as [...] "directed either toward accomplishing his own happiness or the unhappiness of others", Cartman often feigns actual friendship with his classmates when needing a favor. The lack of a true father figure in his life, and Liane's promiscuity and drug use have caused repressed psychological hardship in Cartman's life. As a parent, Liane often spoils Cartman, and is largely ineffectual as a disciplinarian. Cartman sometimes commands his <b>mom</b> <b>to</b> do tasks for him, but more often resorts to pleading with her in an ingratiating tone. When neither method works, he resorts to excessive and indecipherable whining, to which Liane usually succumbs. Parker has noted {{that this is the}} primary cause for Cartman's behavior, stating that Cartman is [...] "just a product of his environment".|$|E

500|$|Starting with Caged Bird, Angelou made a {{deliberate}} attempt while writing all her autobiographies, including Mom & Me & <b>Mom,</b> <b>to</b> challenge the usual {{structure of the}} autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Her use of fiction-writing techniques such as dialogue, characterization, and thematic development has often led reviewers to categorize her books as autobiographical fiction. [...] Valerie Sayers, in her review of Mom & Me & Mom in The Washington Post, calls Angelou's books memoirs because of their limited focus, but praises her for describing {{what it was like}} to grow up Black in [...] "Jim Crow America". [...] Sayers states: [...] "She manages to fully reveal that national sore without picking at it, a neat trick that...requires considerable restraint and her own steely goodwill". [...] Angelou stated in a 1989 interview that she was the only [...] "serious" [...] writer to choose the genre to express herself. [...] As critic Susan Gilbert stated, Angelou was reporting not one person's story, but the collective's. [...] Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe agreed, and viewed Angelou as representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that spoke for an entire group of people. [...] Angelou's editor Robert Loomis was able to convince her to write Caged Bird by challenging her to write an autobiography that could be considered [...] "high art", which she continued throughout her series. [...] Although Angelou was successful, she was, as Sayers insisted, smart and gifted enough to write for any audience, but chose not to write for [...] "a highbrow literary audience", but for [...] "readers as open, playful and straightforward as herself".|$|E
