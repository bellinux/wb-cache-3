30|$|A {{definitive}} {{value for}} moisture of extinction—the fuel moisture content at which fire will not spread, {{or when the}} probability of ignition is 1 %—has not been widely agreed upon for grasses (Dimitrakopoulos et al. 2010). Fire ignition and spread was difficult when moisture content approached 35 % for spinifex grass fuel in Australia, primarily hard spinifex (Triodia basedowii E. Pritz.) and soft spinifex (Plectrachne schinzii Henrard) (Burrows et al. 1991). Laboratory ignition tests for grass samples consisting primarily of Imperata cylindrica in Indonesia found <b>moisture</b> <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> to be 40 % for dead grass and 44 % for live grass (de Groot and Wang 2005). Recent field experiments in Greece estimated the <b>moisture</b> <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> for slender oat (Avena barbata Link.) at 55.5 % (Dimitrakopoulos et al. 2010).

Morphological properties of individual species, including size of culms and leaves, as well as residual dead fuels (not part of our sampling) may also increase the probability of ignition and affect spread, particularly in the robust bunchgrasses (i.e., California fescue).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{long-range}} fire growthmodel {{was developed}} to predict the potential size or probable extent of a wildfire if it was allowed to grow unimpeded for {{the course of the}} fire season. The model combines the probabilities of fire spread and of survival to produce a probable fire extent map. Probability of spread is determined from exponential distributions of potential rates of spread for various fuel types and eight compass directions, based on 30 years of fire weather data and elliptical fire growth. Probability of survival is determined from the probable evolution <b>of</b> the duff <b>moisture</b> code over the fire season predicted with Markov chains and a duff <b>moisture</b> code <b>of</b> <b>extinction.</b> A comparative study was conducted withinWoodBuffaloNational Park. The long-termmodelwas comparedwith a distribution of fire perimeters predicted by repeated simulations using an hourly based, deterministic fire growth model. The study was conducted in stages, starting with a homogeneous fuel type and weather from one station. Later, fuels and weather were introduced to determine their effects on the model. The study showed a close agreement between the long-range model and the deterministic model, supporting the probabilistic approach used by the long-range model...|$|R

30|$|The {{non-native}} dogtail and {{the native}} California oatgrass were the first species to fall below a probable threshold for <b>moisture</b> <b>of</b> <b>extinction,</b> and the moisture content of dogtail was much lower than all other study species on 6 August. Depending on the density of dogtail, it may decrease fuel moisture levels and increase ignitability earlier in the fire season. Although the moisture content of California oatgrass was twice that of dogtail in August (21 % and 42 % respectively), California oatgrass had possibly cured sufficiently to be ignitable based on the more conservative values for <b>moisture</b> <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> estimated for grass species (Burrows et al. 1991). Although still common in the Bald Hills, California oatgrass is patchily distributed in the prairies, and it {{is thought to be}} less dominant now than it was historically (cf. Davy 1902). Potential effects on the fire regime in the prairies of the Bald Hills caused by dogtail may be reduced because of the diminished dominance of California oatgrass. Although the species selected for this study are among the most dominant, there are several other grass species in the Bald Hills, including many other non-native annuals: oats (Avena L. spp.), bromes (Bromus L. spp.), rattail six-weeks grass (Festuca myuros L.), brome fescue (Festuca bromoides L.), and silver hair grass (Aira caryophyllea L.), and a few native annuals (e.g., Poa howellii Vasey & Scribn), that we did not study (Livingston 2014). If other annual species have moisture content values similar to those that we observed for dogtail, they might have an additive effect on the ignition potential of fuel early in the fire season. As our study was not comprehensive, speculation on the net effects of fuel moisture change with invasion is difficult.|$|E
40|$|International audienceFire {{behaviour}} {{data from}} 240 laboratory fires in high-density live chaparral fuel beds {{were compared with}} model predictions. Logistic regression was used to develop a model to predict fire spread success in the fuel beds and linear regression was used to predict rate of spread. Predictions from the Rothermel equation and three proposed changes {{as well as two}} physically based models were compared with observed spread rates of spread. Flame length–fireline intensity relationships were compared with flame length data. Wind was the most important variable related to spread success. Air temperature, live fuel moisture content, slope angle and fuel bed bulk density were significantly related to spread rate. A flame length–fireline intensity model for Galician shrub fuels was similar to the chaparral data. The Rothermel model failed to predict fire spread in nearly all of the fires that spread using default values. Increasing the <b>moisture</b> <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> marginally improved its performance. Modifications proposed by Cohen, Wilson and Catchpole also improved predictions. The models successfully predicted fire spread 49 to 69 % of the time. Only the physical model predictions fell within a factor of two of actual rates. Mean bias of most models was close to zero.

30|$|While {{the study}} only covers eight years, the {{significant}} relationships between climatic anomalies and the land cover burned indicate that interannual climate variability dictates what fuel and vegetation types are available to burn. While {{it is not surprising}} that more area is burned for all land cover types during a longer lasting fire as compared to a shorter one, the contrasts between meteorological conditions conducive to fire in some land cover types but not others provide insight into how climate controls fire regimes in Alaska. For example, Bog burned preferentially when RH was higher and conditions were cooler and wetter during the Burning Period, but Shrubs burned preferentially when RH was lower and conditions were warmer and drier during the Burning Period (Table 1). When this observation is taken in context with the total area burned across the study years, it indicates that while a substantial extent of area burned every year is Conifer and Bog land cover, anomalously warm and dry conditions are conducive to increased fire consumption of the Shrub class. This increased Shrub consumption is potentially associated with increased drought stress on live fuels and the lower RH dropping fuel moistures below the <b>moisture</b> <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> threshold. These same warm and dry conditions are also conducive to fires burning a greater extent of Deciduous forest.|$|E
40|$|The Canadian Forest Fire Behavior Prediction (FBP) System and the American BEHAVE fire {{behavior}} prediction system differ in many respects. These dissimilarities {{stem from a}} basic difference in the two approaches of the {{fire behavior}} prediction problem; the Canadians used an empirical approach in system design, while the Americans developed an adaptable theoretical model. In the spring of 1988 a series of 17 experimental fires in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) needle litter were conducted in the wind tunnel combustion facilities of the Intermountain Fire Sciences Laboratory in Missoula, Montana. The fires were part of investigations into crown fire initiation, and fire acceleration from a point source. However, the data collected allowed the observed equilibrium head fire rate of spread (ROS) to be compared to estimates computed by both the American and Canadian fire behavior prediction systems. The American BEHAVE system tended to underpredict observed ROS by 15 - 60 %, possibly due to wind speed profiles differing from the original developmental study or inaccurate estimation of <b>moisture</b> <b>of</b> <b>extinction.</b> The Canadian FBP System tended to overpredict observed ROS, {{due in part to}} problems in computing a IO-m open wind speed equivalent to the wind tunnel (midflame) wind speed.

40|$|Abstract. The {{estimation}} of moisture content of dead fuels {{is a critical}} variable in fire danger assessment since it is strongly related to fire ignition and fire spread potential. This study evaluates the accuracy of two well-known meteoro-logical moisture codes, the Canadian Fine Fuels Moisture Content and the US 10 -h, to estimate fuel moisture content of dead fuels in Mediterranean areas. Cured grasses and litter {{have been used for}} this study. The study was conducted in two phases. The former aimed to select the most efficient code, and the latter to produce a spatial representation of that index for operational assessment of fire danger conditions. The first phase required calibration and validation of an estimation model based on regression analysis. Field samples were collected in the Cabañeros National Park (Central Spain) for a six-year period (1998 – 2003). The estimations were more accurate for litter (r 2 between 0. 52) than for cured grasslands (r 2 0. 11). In addition, grasslands showed higher variability in the trends among the study years. The two moisture codes evaluated in this paper offered similar trends, therefore, the 10 -h code was selected since it is simpler to compute. The second phase was based on interpolating the required meteorological variables (temperature and relative humidity) to compute the 10 -h moisture code. The interpolation was based on European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast-ing (ECMWF) predictions. Finally, a simple method to combine the estimations of dead fuel moisture content with other variables associated to fire danger is presented in this paper. This method estimates the probability of ignition based on the <b>moisture</b> <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> of each fuel type...|$|E

30|$|In stark {{contrast}} to the patterns in moisture content found in the seven other species, the non-native Harding grass had much higher moisture content than all other species throughout the growing season. Even on its driest sampling date, the moisture content of Harding grass was still more than double a probable value for <b>moisture</b> <b>of</b> <b>extinction.</b> One caveat to our findings is that limited pilot sampling on 28 June 2013 confirmed that the new Harding grass location we moved to in July was more mesic than our original Harding grass location. Mean moisture content for Harding grass at our initial location was 239 % compared to 290 % at the location we moved to (a 18 % difference relative to the new location). Harding grass was also sampled from two other locations in the Bald Hills that had mean moisture contents of 201 % and 203 %, a 31 % and 30 % difference relative to our new Harding grass location, respectively. On 25 September 2012, however, the relative difference between six of the grass species and Harding grass ranged from 84 % to 95 % (relative to Harding grass), and the relative difference between Harding grass and California fescue was 58 % (relative to Harding grass). It is unlikely that sampling in the more mesic location would negate the general pattern we reported, as the magnitude of difference between Harding grass and the other species was so large. Additionally, at our sampling location, Harding grass culms were noticeably greener late into the fall compared to the other co-occurring species. Although the inferences we are able to make from a single study location are somewhat limited, the patterns that we observed are still noteworthy.|$|E
30|$|To include LFMC {{information}} into fire risk assessment systems, one should translate the original scale of LFMC values (percentage of dry weight) into a risk scale {{that can be}} combined with other factors of fire ignition or propagation. The former is commonly approached by transforming LFMC values into ignition probability (IP; Chuvieco et al. 2004 a), defined as {{the likelihood that the}} fuel would ignite when exposed to a heat source. Several papers have presented methods to derive IP from LFMC data. They can be classified in two broad approaches: (1) studies based on biophysical parameters derived from experiment results such as subjecting fresh foliage to flammability tests in order to investigate its ignitability; or (2) studies based on relating moisture values to historical fire occurrence. Within the first group, most of the studies have attempted to establish a critical LFMC threshold below which the fire IP would increase significantly. A clear example of this approach is Rothermel’s (1972) concept of <b>moisture</b> <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> (ME), defined as the moisture threshold above which fire cannot be sustained. Albini (1976) estimated the ME for grassland at 40 %, and Trabaud (1976) found a similar ignition threshold for Mediterranean maquis at 45 %. For several Mediterranean shrubs, this threshold was established at 105 % by Dimitrakopoulos and Papaioannou (2001). Using this critical ME threshold, Chuvieco et al. (2004 a) estimated IP from LFMC, based on an inverse linear relation between ME and the actual LFMC value (the closer to the ME, the lower the IP). The second approach to establish critical thresholds of LFMC to define IP has been based on analyzing statistical relations between LFMC and fire occurrence. Dennison et al. (2008) found for chaparral ecosystems (shrubland plant community in California), that large fires (> 1000 ha) only occurred when LFMC was less than 77 %, although most of the large fires occurred when LFMC was below 71 %. Afterwards, the same authors developed a new analysis by increasing the sample size and including antecedent precipitation patterns. Their conclusion was that 79 % LFMC was the threshold strongly related to large fires (Dennison and Moritz 2009). This result was similar to that obtained by Schoenberg et al. (2003), who found that chaparral burned area increased below an LFMC threshold of 90 %. Pellizzaro et al. (2007) observed that most of the fires in several Mediterranean shrublands of Italy occurred with LFMC values below 100 %. Other authors propose using a gradual scale that correlates the IP increment to the LFMC decrement. For example, Green (1981) established three fire intensity classes in chaparral ecosystems, with the highest intensity occurring below 60 % LFMC. Weise et al. (1998) considered four fire danger classes in which fire danger was also extreme below 60 % LFMC. Consequently, IP is defined by a statistical tool like histograms and percentiles. More recently, logistic regression (LR) models were used to estimate IP in Mediterranean grasses and shrubs (Chuvieco et al. 2009), while Dimitrakopoulos et al. (2010) have used classification trees to explore multiple factors associated with IP.|$|E
40|$|Forest {{fires in}} the Alps can have severe impacts on {{mountain}} forests reducing their protection capacity against rock falls and avalanches and increasing flood runoff, mud and debris flows (Moody and Martin 2001, Robichaud et al. 2007). Due to climate change, several {{studies have shown that}} the impact of forest {{fires in the}} Alpine environment will increase in the coming decades (Elkin et al. 2013, Lorz et al. 2010, Wastl et al. 2012). A key issue in modern forest fire management is the accurate mapping of forest fuels in order to determine spatial fire hazard, plan mitigation efforts, and active fire management (Krasnow et al. 2009). Several surface fuel description systems are currently used by land management agencies in the USA, Europe, Canada and Australia, and most of these systems have the same categories, components and description variables (Sandberg et al. 2001, Scott and Burgan 2005). A generalized description of fuels based upon average fuel properties is called a “fuel model”. A fuel model is a set of fuelbed inputs (e. g. load, bulk density, fuel particle size, heat content and <b>moisture</b> <b>of</b> <b>extinction)</b> used by a specific software for predicting the fire behaviour (e. g. FARSITE). Standard fuel models were developed in the USA by Anderson (1982) and more recently by Scott and Burgan (2005). Standard fuel models that fit the main local vegetation characteristics can be used as input for fire spread modelling and in combination with custom fuel models when available (Duguy et al. 2007, Arca et al. 2009, Jahdi et al. 2015). However, the Standard or custom fuel models have seldom been applied in the Alps. In this study we tested the possibility of defining some custom fuel models for the Eastern Italian Alps, which might allow a more reliable fire behaviour prediction when fire simulator systems are used. The custom fuel models definition was done by means of three steps: In the first step we studied local fire regime and fire behaviour and we tested the hypothesis that the decrease in burned area is related to an improvement in fire-fighting efficiency since the beginning of the 3 rd millennium. In the second step fuel properties were measured in the field and analyzed. In the third step we made three fuel model sets based on three different approaches (Forest type association, Prometheus classification, Cluster classification). Then, using FARSITE (Finney 2004), we simulated ten fires that occurred in the Veneto Region from 2003 to 2013. Every fire was simulated using the three custom model sets and the Standard fuel models (Anderson 1982, Scott and Burgan 2005). Lastly, the fuel model set having the higher accuracy was adjusted in order to improve its performance in simulating real fire behaviour. In the Veneto Region, there was a decreasing number of fires per year from 1981 to 2004 and a much more evident decrease in the annual burned area. Fires in both mountain areas and the lowlands usually behave as surface fires and the burned area is seldom larger than ten hectares. We tested the hypothesis that the decrease in burned area is related to an improvement in fire-fighting efficiency since the beginning of the 3 rd millennium. The power-law distribution of burned areas seems to confirm that suppression efficiency has been improved because the exponent of the power-law distribution was much higher in the last decade than in the previous two. In mountain areas fuel load paralleled what is reported in the literature for similar forests, but in the lowlands fuel load appeared much higher, probably because those forests are affected by phytosanitary problems that cause a higher amount of deadwood. We found significant differences in fuel load among vegetation types (chestnut, hop hornbeam forests, conifer plantations and shrubland), The most significant difference was litter load (p< 0. 001 in the lowlands; p= 0. 0015 in mountain areas). Significant differences were also found between forest managements (coppiced, high forest, unmanaged). Mainly shrubs load (p< 0. 0018 in the lowlands) and herbs (p= 0. 0029 in mountain areas). The fuel distribution in size classes was never normal but, as commonly reported in the literature, it followed a logarithmic or a power-law trend. The tests on fire behaviour fuel models showed that Prometheus and Cluster fuel model sets led to inaccurate fire behaviour predictions. Standard fuel models (Anderson 1982, Scott and Burgan 2005) generally performed well and Forest type fuel models were the best in predicting fire behaviour, despite a frequent underestimation of flame height and rate of spread. By using a calibration process, we modified the Forest type fuel models and improved the performance in FARSITE. The resulting Calibrated fuel models could be suggested for further fire behaviour applications in the Eastern Italian Alps. ...|$|E

Genetic diversity was characterized using isozyme electrophoresis. Risk <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> was assessed from the literature. We found that species differed in all these traits. Using these data, we conducted a Pearson correlation between risk <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> and ecological and life history traits, and genetic variation, for widely distributed species. We found a negative association between risk <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> and population birth and growth rates; indicating that slower reproducing species had a greater risk <b>of</b> <b>extinction.</b> We found a positive association between genetic variation and risk of extinction; i. e., species showing higher genetic variation had a greater risk <b>of</b> <b>extinction.</b> The relevance <b>of</b> these traits for conservation efforts is discussed...|$|R
50|$|Another {{role that}} the vmPFC plays {{is in the process}} <b>of</b> <b>extinction,</b> the gradual {{weakening}} and eventual cessation of a conditioned response. The specific role played by the vmPFC concerning extinction is not well understood, but it is believed that it plays a necessary role in the recall <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> learning after a long period of time. Studies show that it aids in the consolidation <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> learning. A separate study has implicated the correlation between the cortical thickness of the vmPFC and the degree <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> memory. Patients with larger vmPFCs tended to have lower responses to the extinct conditioned stimulus, therefore suggesting a superior extinction memory. In general, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex {{plays a major role in}} the later stages of memory consolidation.|$|R
40|$|AbstractUnderstanding how {{fears are}} {{acquired}} {{is an important}} step in translating basic research to the treatment of fear-related disorders. However, understanding how learned fears are diminished may be even more valuable. We explored the neural mechanisms <b>of</b> fear <b>extinction</b> in humans. Studies <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> in nonhuman animals have focused on two interconnected brain regions: the amygdala and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Consistent with animal models suggesting that the amygdala is important for both the acquisition and <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> conditioned fear, amygdala activation was correlated across subjects with the conditioned response in both acquisition and early extinction. Activation in the vmPFC (subgenual anterior cingulate) was primarily linked to the expression of fear learning during a delayed test <b>of</b> <b>extinction,</b> as might have been expected from studies demonstrating this region is critical for the retention <b>of</b> <b>extinction.</b> These results provide evidence that the mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> learning may be preserved across species...|$|R
40|$|Because {{the fossil}} record is incomplete, the last fossil of a taxon is a biased {{estimate}} of its true time <b>of</b> <b>extinction.</b> Numerous methods have been developed in the palaeontology literature for estimating the true time <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> using ages <b>of</b> fossil specimens. These methods, which typically give a confidence interval for estimating the true time <b>of</b> <b>extinction,</b> differ in the assumptions they make and the nature and amount of data they require. We review the literature on such methods and make some recommendations for future directions...|$|R
30|$|The medial {{prefrontal cortex}} (mPFC) {{can be divided}} into four parts: {{anterior}} cingulate cortex, prelimbic cortex (PrL), infralimbic cortex (IL), and medial agranular cortex (Berendse and Groenewegen, 1991; Ongur and Price, 2000). Starting from the study <b>of</b> fear <b>extinction</b> impaired by lesions of the ventral mPFC (vmPFC-PrL and IL), a role of the vmPFC in fear extinction has been discovered (Morgan et al., 1993). Lesion of the IL has an effect not on acquisition <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> but on extinction retrieval, suggesting a role of IL in consolidation (Quirk et al., 2000). Consistently, unit activity of IL neurons was shown not in fear conditioning nor in extinction training but in recall <b>of</b> <b>extinction.</b> Thus, microstimulation <b>of</b> IL during <b>extinction</b> training enhanced extinction recall (Milad and Quirk, 2002). Intra-IL infusion of NMDAr antagonist CPP, sodium channel blocker TTX, or anisomycin did not impair fear conditioning or acquisition <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> but suppressed recall <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> (Burgos-Robles et al., 2007; Santini et al., 2004; Sierra-Mercado et al., 2006). Systemic injection of CPP also selectively reduced burst firing in vmPFC neurons (Burgos-Robles et al., 2007). In addition, IL infusion of muscimol (GABAA receptor agonist) immediately after extinction training blocked recall <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> (Laurent and Westbrook, 2008). Interestingly, BDNF infused into the IL reduced conditioned fear for up to 48  h, even in the absence <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> training, and BDNF-induced reduction in fear required N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (Peters et al., 2010).|$|R
40|$|A kill curve for Phanerozoic {{species is}} {{developed}} from {{an analysis of}} the stratigraphic ranges of 17, 621 genera, as compiled by Sepkoski. The kill curve shows that a typical species' risk <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> varies greatly, with most time intervals being characterized by very low risk. The mean <b>extinction</b> rate <b>of</b> 0. 25 /m. y. is thus a mixture of long periods <b>of</b> negligible <b>extinction</b> and occasional pulses of much higher rate. Because the kill curve is merely a description of the fossil record, it does not speak directly to the causes <b>of</b> <b>extinction.</b> The kill curve may be useful, however, to li inverted question markmit choices <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> mechanisms...|$|R
30|$|The {{probability}} <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> {{a process}} is found when f(q)=q, i.e at the intersect between its probability generating function f(q) and the diagonal q. Thus, processes {{with a high}} probability <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> will cross the diagonal near q= 1, {{in the domain of}} q in which the probability generating function is often closely related to its first few moments.|$|R
