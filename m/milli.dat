5|$|Amrullah Saleh {{consequently}} {{founded the}} Basej-e <b>Milli</b> (National Movement), {{also known as}} Afghanistan Green Trend, a political movement which has successfully established itself in Afghanistan. In May 2011, more than 20,000 of his followers took part in an anti-Taliban demonstration in the capital Kabul.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Saleh was {{appointed}} by mujahideen leader Massoud to serve as Northern Alliance's liaison office inside the Afghan Embassy in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, handling contacts to international non-governmental (humanitarian) organizations and intelligence agencies. In late 2010, Saleh created a pro-democracy and anti-Taliban movement called Basej-e <b>Milli</b> (National Mobilization) and Green Trend.|$|E
5|$|This system {{continued}} {{the tradition of}} having separate base units for geometrically related dimensions, e.g., mètre for lengths, are (100m2) for areas, stère (1m3) for dry capacities, and litre (1 dm3) for liquid capacities. The hectare, equal to a hundred ares, the area of a square 100 metres on a side (about 2.47 acres), is still in use. The early metric system included only a few prefixes from <b>milli</b> (one thousandth) to myria (ten thousand).|$|E
5|$|According to Mummer Kaylan, {{author of}} The Kemalists: Islamic Revival and the Fate of Secular Turkey, Bazna {{said that he}} began spying for the Germans because he needed the money and, {{although}} {{he was not a}} Nazi, he liked Germans and disliked the British. He also alluded to involvement with the <b>Milli</b> Emniyet Hizmeti, which became the Turkish National Security Service in 1965. The British historian Richard Wires wrote Bazna was motivated entirely by greed as he had dreams of becoming rich by selling secrets to the Germans. Wires described Bazna as a typical petty criminal from the Balkans, a man of low intelligence with no values except greed who was apolitical and opportunistic, taking advantages of whatever chances he found to try to get rich, but who was easily duped by the Germans.|$|E

25|$|Having {{formed an}} electoral {{alliance}} {{under the name}} National Alliance (<b>Millî</b> İttifak), the Felicity Party (SP) and the Great Union Party (BBP) campaigned on a religious platform. SP leader Mustafa Kamalak and BBP leader Mustafa Destici held joint electoral rallies. It was reported on 29 May that an Alliance electoral rally at Bartın had been cancelled due to no turnout, though the Alliance released a statement stating {{that there had been}} no rally planned in Bartın on that day. The Alliance became the first ever party or alliance in Turkey to release a 'vocal manifesto' online. Arguing for a return to Necmettin Erbakan's ideology of National View (<b>Millî</b> Görüş), the Alliance blamed the AKP for having a hand in the growing unrest in the Middle East and criticised CHP leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu for accusing the Alliance of being 'enemies of Islam'. An Alliance candidate from Sivas claimed that they would complain to the Constitutional Court should they not surpass the 10% threshold.|$|E

25|$|After {{these details}} emerged, at least 27 {{different}} lawsuits were filed under various U.S. consumer fraud protection laws against Pilatus, Morvan and Arista Records. One such filing occurred on 22 November 1990, in Ohio, where lawyers filed a class-action lawsuit asking for refunds {{on behalf of}} a local woman in Cuyahoga County, who had bought Girl You Know It's True. At the time the lawsuit was filed, it was estimated at least 1,000 Ohio residents had bought the album. On 12 August 1991, a proposed settlement of a refund lawsuit in Chicago, Illinois, was rejected. This settlement would have refunded buyers of <b>Milli</b> Vanilli CDs, cassettes, records, or singles. However, the refunds would only be given as a credit for a future Arista release. On 28 August, a new settlement was approved; it refunded those who attended concerts along with those who bought <b>Milli</b> Vanilli recordings. An estimated 10 million buyers were eligible to claim a refund and they could keep the refunded recordings as well. The deadline to claim refunds passed on 8 March 1992.|$|E

On July 24, 2017, the autonomy agreement signed in 1994 between Moscow and Kazan expired, making Tatarstan the last republic of Russia to lose its special status.|$|E
25|$|Except during World War I Afghanistan's foreign {{exchange}} rate has been freely determined by market forces. However, for some periods, a dual exchange rate regime existed in Afghanistan: an official exchange rate which was fixed by the Afghan Central Bank, and a free market exchange rate which {{was determined by the}} supply and demand forces in Kabul's money bazaar called Saraye Shahzada. For example, {{in order to avoid the}} seasonal fluctuations in the exchange rate, a fixed exchange rate was adopted in 1935 by the Bank-e <b>Milli,</b> which was then responsible for the country's exchange rate system and official reserves. Bank-e <b>Milli</b> agreed to exchange afghanis at 4 Afs against 1 Indian rupee in 1935. After the establishment of Da Afghanistan Bank as the Central Bank of Afghanistan, such a preferential official fixed exchange rate continued to be practiced. Although Da Afghanistan Bank tried to keep its official rate close to the Saraye Shahzada's exchange rate, the gap between the official and free-market exchange rates widened in the 1980s and during the civil war.|$|E
25|$|In general, Altınordu is {{reported}} {{as he had}} been primarily deployed as a defender, but; he also possessed scoring abilities which led him to produce 29 senior goals during his career, including him to be the top scorer of 1936–37 <b>Millî</b> Küme campaign with 13 goals. Following his representation of Altınordu S.K. between 1932 and 1937, there was no player called-up at Turkey national team for 78 years, until Çağlar Söyüncü was invited in 2016.|$|E
25|$|Kabul's <b>Milli</b> Bus (National Bus) system, {{which has}} about 800 buses, {{provides}} service {{to the city and}} nearby areas. There are several new highways in the province, and the government has scheduled to rebuild most of the smaller roads. Funding for the roads comes from current drivers who must pay toll charges for driving on highways and major roads.

25|$|Russian TV channel Dozhd {{reported}} that the Azerbaijani authorities launched a criminal case against the direction and journalists of the Azerbaijani independent channel Meydan TV because of {{the publication of the}} list of Azerbaijani soldiers killed during the clashes in Nagorno-Karabakh. Their list consisted of 94 names, while the Defense Ministry of Azerbaijan confirmed only 31 deaths. According to the Meydan TV chief editor Emin <b>Milli,</b> each person on their list really died in the clashes, and he stated that the Ministry of Defense of Azerbaijan could not deny this information.|$|E
25|$|The {{religious}} {{practices of the}} Turks are often intersect with their political persuasions. For example, Turks who follow the Kemalist ideology {{tend to be more}} secular and often do not practice their religion. On the other hand, followers of more conservative ideologies, such as the <b>Millî</b> Görüş and Gülenists movements, are more likely to practice their religion. Nonetheless, in general, religion within the Turkish community has been particularly important for ethnic reassurance in order to retain the Turkish culture rather than solely practicing the Islamic faith. There are also some Turks who do not practice a religion at all and identify as atheists or who have converted to other religions.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} analyser characteristics. The mass resolving {{power is the}} measure of the ability to distinguish two peaks of slightly different m/z. The mass accuracy is the ratio of the m/z measurement error to the true m/z. Mass accuracy is usually measured in ppm or <b>milli</b> mass units. The mass range is the range of m/z amenable to analysis by a given analyzer. The linear dynamic range is the range over which ion signal is linear with analyte concentration. Speed refers to the time frame of the experiment and ultimately is used to determine the number of spectra per unit time that can be generated.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the sudden}} {{initiation}} of the war, working government departments, police units, {{and a system}} of justice and accountability for the newly created Islamic State of Afghanistan {{did not have time}} to form. Atrocities were committed by individuals of the different armed factions while Kabul descended into lawlessness and chaos. Because of the chaos, some leaders increasingly had only nominal control over their (sub-)commanders. For civilians there was little security from murder, rape, and extortion. An estimated 25,000 people died during the most intense period of bombardment by Hekmatyar's Hezb-i Islami and the Junbish-i <b>Milli</b> forces of Abdul Rashid Dostum, who had created an alliance with Hekmatyar in 1994. Half a million people fled Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|In Islamic literature, {{apostasy}} {{is called}} irtidād or ridda; an apostate is called murtadd, which literally means 'one who turns back' from Islam.

25|$|Unlike the {{international}} release of All or Nothing, the inserts for the American {{version of the}} album explicitly attributed the vocals to Morvan and Pilatus. This prompted singer Charles Shaw to reveal in December 1989 {{that he was one}} of the three actual singers on the album and that Pilatus and Morvan were impostors. Farian reportedly paid Shaw $150,000 to retract his statements, though this did not stem the tide of public criticism. Because of growing public questioning as to who sang in the group, as well as the Morvan and Pilatus' demand to Farian that they be allowed to sing on the next album, Farian confessed to reporters on 12 November 1990 that Morvan and Pilatus did not sing on the records. As a result of American media pressure, <b>Milli</b> Vanilli's Grammy was withdrawn four days later. However, their three American Music Awards were never withdrawn because the organizers felt the awards were given to them by music consumers.|$|E
25|$|On 7 January 1946, he {{and former}} prime {{minister}} Celal Bayar formed the Democratic Party (DP), the fourth legal opposition party in Turkey, after the Progressive Republican Party formed by retired General Kazım Karabekir in 1924, the Liberal Republican Party established by Ali Fethi Okyar in 1930, and the National Development Party (<b>Milli</b> Kalkınma Partisi) established by Nuri Demirağ in 1945, the first two of which were banned in at most {{a few months after}} their founding by the Republican People's Party (CHP), which was the party in power until 1950 elections in Turkey. He was elected deputy of Kütahya in the 1946 elections. When the DP won 52% of the votes in the first free elections in Turkish history on 14 May 1950 (in which votes were cast in secret and counted openly), Menderes became prime minister, and in 1955 he also assumed the duties of foreign minister. He later won two more free elections, one in 1954 and the other in 1957.|$|E
25|$|In late 1994, most of {{the militia}} factions (Hezb-i Islami, Junbish-i <b>Milli</b> and Hezb-i Wahdat) which had been {{fighting}} {{in the battle for}} control of Kabul were defeated militarily by forces of the Islamic State's Secretary of Defense Ahmad Shah Massoud. Bombardment of the capital came to a halt. Massoud tried to initiate a nationwide political process with the goal of national consolidation and democratic elections, also inviting the Taliban to join the process. Massoud had united political and cultural personalities, governors, commanders, clergymen and representatives to reach a lasting agreement. Massoud, like most people in Afghanistan, saw this conference as a small hope for democracy and for free elections. His favourite for candidacy to the presidency was Dr. Mohammad Yusuf, the first democratic prime minister under Zahir Shah, the former king. In the first meeting representatives from 15 different Afghan provinces met, in the second meeting there were already 25 provinces participating. Massoud went unarmed to talk to several Taliban leaders in Maidan Shar, but the Taliban declined to join this political process. When Massoud returned safely, the Taliban leader who had received him as his guest paid with his life: he was killed by other senior Taliban for failing to execute Massoud while the possibility was there.|$|E
25|$|The Nationalist Movement Party {{claimed that}} they would {{consider}} an electoral alliance with the Felicity Party (SP) and the Great Union Party (BBP), but said nothing regarding the Conservative Ascension Party (MYP), which had long called for a union of nationalist parties. In the end, the MHP decided not to pursue a formal electoral alliance, but said it was open to defectors from any party. The MYP subsequently announced support for the MHP. The BBP has since decided to contest the election under the SP banner, and will thus be absent from the ballot papers. The Nation and Justice Party (MİLAD) planned to join the SP and BBP, {{but it did not}} actualise. The new electoral alliance between these parties was named the National Alliance (<b>Millî</b> İttifak). The candidate lists were drawn up such that BBP candidates were placed top in electoral districts in which they won more votes than the SP in 2011, while SP candidates were placed top in provinces in which the SP had beaten the BBP in 2011. This meant that an SP candidate was placed first in 55 provinces, while a BBP candidate was placed first in 30. The remaining positions subsequently alternated between SP and BBP candidates.|$|E
