40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is one of}} {{the steps}} towards the area of estimation of population variance using multi-auxiliary variables under multi-phase sampling scheme. This work mainly considers full, incomplete and no information cases about the auxiliary variables. The importance of estimation of finite population variance under multi-phase sampling along with some previously proposed estimators are discussed in Chapter 1. In Chapters 2 and 3, some ratio-type and regression-type variance estimators for estimation of population variance using multi-auxiliary variables for single interest variable are proposed. To the solution of <b>multi-purpose</b> <b>surveys,</b> few generalized multi-variate ratio-type and regression-type variance estimators are discussed in Chapters 4 and 5 respectively. Chapters 6 and 7 highlight the solution to the problem when multi-attributes is to be dealt for the estimation of population variance under multi-phase sampling. The measurement error in variable of interest is taken into account in Chapters 8 and 9 for the same estimators proposed in Chapters 2 and 3. The expressions for minimum mean square error for all proposed estimators are also derived. Some real data sets are used for efficiency comparison...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study the value of {{national}} health interview surveys for national and international research and policy activities, this paper examines the existence and content of recent and future health interview surveys in the 15 member states of the European Union (EU), Norway, Iceland and Switzerland. National health interview surveys are performed in most countries, but not in Greece (only regional surveys), Luxembourg, Ireland and Iceland (only <b>multi-purpose</b> <b>surveys).</b> The health interview surveys in the other 14 countries provide regular data on the main health topics. Of the 14 health topics that are examined in this inventory seven are measured in all countries. Questions on health status (e. g. self-assessed health, long-term physical disability, and height and weight) and medical consumption (e. g. consultations with the general practitioner, GP) are often included. Lifestyle topics are less often included, except smoking habits, information about which is sought in all countries. Topics like diet and drugs/narcotics are more often included in special surveys than in general health interview surveys. Despite differences in the content, frequency and methodology of national health surveys in different countries, these surveys are a valuable source {{of information on the}} health of Europeans.

40|$|The {{project on}} Health Surveys in the EU {{supports}} health monitoring {{by developing a}} computerised health survey database, by reviewing and evaluating surveys, their methods and comparability, by recommending designs and methods, and by disseminating this information. It also assesses the coverage of specific health and health related areas in national and international surveys. At present, Health Interview Surveys (HIS) and Health Examination Surveys (HES) are included from 18 Western European countries as well as Canada, Australia and USA. National HISs are carried out regularly in almost all Western European countries. National HESs with a comprehensive focus are conducted at regular or irregular intervals in five countries. The HIS may consist of short health sections or modules within <b>multi-purpose</b> <b>surveys</b> or lengthy health interviews with several questionnaires. The HES (or HIS/HES) may comprise {{an interview with a}} few measurements or a comprehensive health examination. There are important differences in sampling frames, in fieldwork, and in quality control procedures. The response rates vary greatly. Differences in instruments used, in the wordings and in survey protocols reduce the comparability of many topics. The interactive Internet based HIS/HES database allows for a quick reference and comparison of methods and instruments used in national health surveys. It also illustrates the great variety in instruments and protocols, and the need for harmonisation. Collaboration and co-ordination is needed to promote comprehensive health monitoring at the European level...|$|E
40|$|Much of the {{evidence}} used to-date to back up statements about the market share of faith-inspired providers {{of health care in}} sub-Saharan Africa comes from data on health care facilities, and especially on the share of hospital beds held by Christian Health Associations in the countries where these associations operate. In those countries, estimates of the market share of faith-inspired health care providers based on hospital beds or similar measures are the 30 percent to 50 percent range. On the other hand, {{the evidence}} available from <b>multi-purpose</b> integrated household <b>surveys</b> that ask households where they go for health care and that identify specifically faith-inspired providers in survey questionnaires tells a different story, with lower market shares for faith-inspired facilities. One could ask whether the evidence from these <b>multi-purpose</b> integrated household <b>surveys</b> is itself robust. The objective in this chapter is to assess whether this is the case. Specifically, the idea is to compare market share estimates obtained from different types household surveys, by considering not only <b>multi-purpose</b> integrated <b>surveys,</b> but also Demographic and Health Surveys for which country coverage is larger. The findings suggest that market share estimates for faith-inspired healthcare providers are of a similar order of magnitude in both Demographic and Health <b>Surveys</b> and <b>multi-purpose</b> integrated <b>surveys.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|As survey {{researchers}} {{attempt to}} maintain traditionally high response rates, reluctant respondents {{have resulted in}} increasing data collection costs. This respondent reluctance {{may be related to}} the amount of time it takes to complete an interview in large-scale, <b>multi-purpose</b> <b>surveys,</b> such as the National Survey of Recent College Graduates (NSRCG). Recognizing that respondent burden or questionnaire length may contribute to lower response rates, in 2003, following several months of data collection under the standard data collection protocol, the NSRCG offered its nonrespondents monetary incentives about two months before the end of the data collection,. In conjunction with the incentive offer, the NSRCG also offered persistent nonrespondents an opportunity to complete a much-abbreviated interview consisting of a few critical items. The late respondents who completed the interviews as the result of the incentive and critical items-only questionnaire offers may provide some insight into the issue of nonresponse bias and the likelihood that such interviewees would have remained survey nonrespondents if these refusal conversion efforts had not been made. In this paper, we define “reluctant respondents ” as those who responded to the survey only after extra efforts were made beyond the ones initially planned in the standard data collection protocol. Specifically, reluctant respondents in the 2003 NSRCG are those who responded to the regular or shortened questionnaire following the incentive offer. Our conjecture was that the behavior of the reluctant respondents would be more like that of nonrespondents than of respondents to th...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: We {{undertook}} <b>multi-purpose</b> <b>surveys</b> {{of doctors}} who qualified in the United Kingdom (UK) between 1993 and 2012. Doctors were asked specific {{questions about their}} careers; {{and were asked to}} comment about any aspect of their training or work. We report doctors’ comments about working whilst acutely ill. Design, setting and participants: Nine cohorts of doctors, comprising all UK medical qualifiers of 1993, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2009 and 2012, were sent questionnaires one, five and ten years after graduation. Main outcome measures: Comments made by doctors about working when ill. Results: The response rate, overall, was 57. 4 % (38 613 / 67 224 doctors). Free-text comments were provided by 30. 7 % (11 859 / 38 613). 321 doctors (2. 7 % of those who wrote comments) wrote about working when feeling acutely ill. Working with Exhaustion/fatigue was the most frequent topic raised (195 doctors), followed by problems with Taking time off for illness (112), and general comments on Physical/mental health problems (66). Other topics raised included Supportfrom others, Leaving or adapting/coping with the situation, Bullying, the Doctor’s ability to care for patients, and Death/bereavement. Arrangements for cover due to illness were regarded as insufficient by some respondents; some wrote that doctors were expected to work harder and longer to cover for colleagues absent because of illness. Conclusions: We recommend that employers ensure that it is not unduly difficult for doctors to take time off work when ill, and that employers review their strategies for covering ill doctors who are off work. </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{two aspects}} of spatial statistics: sampling and prediction. In spatial statistics, we observe some phenomena in space. Space is typically {{of two or three}} dimensions, but can be of higher dimension. Questions in mind could be; What is the total amount of gold in a gold-mine? How much precipitation could we expect in a specific unobserved location? What is the total tree volume in a forest area? In spatial sampling the aim is to estimate global quantities, such as population totals, based on samples of locations (papers III and IV). In spatial prediction the aim is to estimate local quantities, such as the value at a single unobserved location, with a measure of uncertainty (papers I, II and V). In papers III and IV, we propose sampling designs for selecting representative probability samples in presence of auxiliary variables. If the phenomena under study have clear trends in the auxiliary space, estimation of population quantities can be improved by using representative samples. Such samples also enable estimation of population quantities in subspaces and are especially needed for <b>multi-purpose</b> <b>surveys,</b> when several target variables are of interest. In papers I and II, the objective is to construct valid prediction intervals for the value at a new location, given observed data. Prediction intervals typically rely on the kriging predictor having a Gaussian distribution. In paper I, we show that the distribution of the kriging predictor can be far from Gaussian, even asymptotically. This motivated us to propose a semiparametric method that does not require distributional assumptions. Prediction intervals are constructed from the plug-in ordinary kriging predictor. In paper V, we consider prediction in the presence of left-censoring, where observations falling below a minimum detection limit are not fully recorded. We review existing methods and propose a semi-naive method. The semi-naive method is compared to one model-based method and two naive methods, all based on variants of the kriging predictor...|$|E

40|$|Statistical {{agencies}} {{are being asked}} to provide more detailed information on a wider range of topics for an increasing number of subpopulations. In many cases, the sampling requirements to meet the needs for estimates for one subgroup are in competition with those for another subgroup of interest. At the same time, funding for core data collection programs has not expanded to meet these increased needs. One solution to this problem is to develop an integrated approach to data collection. NCHS has been experimenting with several ways to achieve this integration to meet the growing needs for essential data. 1. Surveys as sampling frames: At the core of many statistical systems is a large, <b>multi-purpose</b> <b>survey.</b> Such surveys usually obtain demographic information in addition to basic measures in the substantive area of interest. For health data in the US, the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) serves this function {{and is one of the}} main sources of information on the health status and health care utilization of the U. S. population. The survey has been conducted continuously since 1957, and the current sample design provides data for about 40, 000 households and 100, 000 persons a year. There is an over sampling of African Americans and Hispanics. While the sample is not designed to make state estimates, there are at least two primar...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to map the}} {{incidence}} of teamwork in European manufacturing industries and describe the process of teamwork diffusion over time. The impact of country, company size, manufacturing sector and other factors on teamwork diffusion is identified. The study is {{based on data from}} 3, 522 companies gathered by the European Manufacturing Survey covering ten European countries with a common survey tool. Overall, six out of ten manufacturers with more than 20 employees have implemented teamwork in production. Furthermore, the authors show that implementation rates vary significantly by country, firm size and, to a lesser extent, sector of the company's activity. R&D expenditure, product complexity, innovation capability, strategy {{and to a lesser extent}} international competition and supply chain position create significant differences between firms opting for teamwork as a work organization practice and companies neglecting it. The main limitations of the paper derive from the concept of EMS as a <b>multi-purpose</b> <b>survey</b> and the lack of adequate representation across European countries. The value of this research is the ability to offer recent, international and relevant figures about teamwork implementation and diffusion. Furthermore the data set makes it possible for the first time to describe the process of teamwork diffusion over time...|$|R
40|$|The article {{examines}} trends of social inequalities in educational attainment {{in the second}} half of the twentieth century in Italy, comparing two approaches. The traditional approach uses years of education as a dependent variable and implicitly looks at the absolute/nominal value of education. The second approach refers to education as a ‘positional good’ and it captures its possibly changing occupational value over time. In this article, following this second perspective, two measures are developed and used: the Educational Competitive Advantage Score (ECAS) measures the value of educational degrees on the basis of their incidence in the population (credential inflation perspective). The second is an effect-proportional scale of education based on the average occupational prestige attained by individuals in each qualification (demand–supply balance perspective). Using data with large sample size from three waves of the Istat <b>Multi-Purpose</b> <b>Survey</b> (1998, 2003 and 2009), the article shows that inequalities based both on social class of origin and parental education declined between 1940 and 1980 birth cohorts, but the effect of parental education reduced less and it is stronger than that of social class in recent cohorts. Considering education as a positional good does not change the main findings obtained using years of education as outcome in the Italian case...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the sociodemographic determinants of diet {{quality of the}} elderly in four EU countries. Design: Cross-sectional study. For each country, a regression was performed of a multidimensional index of dietary quality v. sociodemographic variables. Setting In Finland, Finnish Household Budget Survey (1998 and 2006); in Sweden, SNAC-K (2001 – 2004); in the UK, Expenditure & Food Survey (2006 – 07); in Italy, <b>Multi-purpose</b> <b>Survey</b> of Daily Life (2009). Subjects: One- and two-person households of over- 50 s (Finland, n 2994; UK, n 4749); over- 50 s living alone or in two-person households (Italy, n 7564); over- 60 s (Sweden, n 2023). Results: Diet quality among the EU elderly is both low on average and heterogeneous across individuals. The regression models explained a small but {{significant part of the}} observed heterogeneity in diet quality. Resource availability was associated with diet quality either negatively (Finland and UK) or in a non-linear or non-statistically significant manner (Italy and Sweden), as was the preference for food parameter. Education, not living alone and female gender were characteristics positively associated with diet quality with consistency across the four countries, unlike socio-professional status, age and seasonality. Regional differences within countries persisted even after controlling for the other sociodemographic variables. Conclusions: Poor dietary choices among the EU elderly were not caused by insufficient resources and informational measures could be successful in promoting healthy eating for healthy ageing. On the other hand, food habits appeared largely set {{in the latter part of}} life, with age and retirement having little influence on the healthiness of dietary choices...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Surveys of {{immigrants}} face challenges of coverage, representativeness and response rates. Longitudinal studies {{of immigrants}} and ethnic minorities, which have potential to address pressing issues in demographic research, are rare or partial. In the absence of register data, the highest quality approach is argued to be probability sampling using household screening. OBJECTIVE: To describe the design and implementation of a nationally representative probability sample {{of immigrants and}} ethnic minorities in the UK. METHODS: We boosted a nationally-representative sample by using small-area Census data to identify areas that covered the majority of immigrant and target ethnic minority populations and over-sampled addresses from those areas using varying sampling fractions. Households were screened for eligibility based on whether they included a target immigrant / ethnic minority member. If so, all adult members were interviewed. RESULTS: We anticipated the main challenges would be: fewer eligible households than predicted in sampled areas due to geographical mobility; refusal of those screened to provide information on household eligibility; non-participation of eligible households. All these issues were found to some degree. We describe how we addressed them and with what success. CONCLUSIONS: A careful design and robust fieldwork practices can enable a two-stage probability sampling to achieve good coverage and a much more representative sample of immigrants and ethnic minorities than with more ad hoc methods. The potential research payoffs are substantial. CONTRIBUTION: We demonstrate the potential for careful two-stage sampling {{on the back of}} an existing study for creating a high quality <b>multi-purpose</b> <b>survey</b> of immigrants...|$|R
40|$|AbstractVaccination {{coverage}} {{is a widely}} used indicator of programme performance, measured by registries, routine administrative reports or household surveys. Because the population denominator and the reported number of vaccinations used in administrative estimates are often inaccurate, survey data are often considered to be more reliable. Many countries obtain survey data on vaccination coverage every 3 – 5 years from large-scale <b>multi-purpose</b> <b>survey</b> programs. Additional surveys {{may be needed to}} evaluate coverage in Supplemental Immunization Activities such as measles or polio campaigns, or after major changes have occurred in the vaccination programme or its context. When a coverage survey is undertaken, rigorous statistical principles and field protocols should be followed to avoid selection bias and information bias. This requires substantial time, expertise and resources hence the role of vaccination coverage surveys in programme monitoring needs to be carefully defined. At times, programmatic monitoring may be more appropriate and provides data to guide program improvement. Practical field methods such as health facility-based assessments can evaluate multiple aspects of service provision, costs, coverage (among clinic attendees) and data quality. Similarly, purposeful sampling or censuses of specific populations can help local health workers evaluate their own performance and understand community attitudes, without trying to claim that the results are representative of the entire population. Administrative reports enable programme managers to do real-time monitoring, investigate potential problems and take timely remedial action, thus improvement of administrative estimates is of high priority. Most importantly, investment in collecting data needs to be complemented by investment in acting on results to improve performance...|$|R

These shares are actually the same or even higher in rural areas, reflecting the unusual high levels of cost recovery in rural areas in Paraguay.

To {{identify}} and evaluate inequities in access to drinking water services {{as reflected in}} household per capita expenditure on water, and to determine what proportion of household expenditures is spent on water in 11 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. Methods. Using data from <b>multi-purpose</b> household <b>surveys</b> (such as the Living Standards Measurement Survey Study) conducted in 11 countries from 1995 to 1999, the availability of drinking water as well as total and per capita household expenditures on drinking water were analyzed in light of socioeconomic parameters, such as urban vs. rural setting, household income, type and regularity of water supply service, time spent obtaining water in homes not served by running water, and type of water-purifying treatment, if any. Results. Access to drinking water as well as total and per capita household expenditures on drinking water show an association with household income, economic conditions of the household, and location. The access of the rural population to drinking water services is much more restricted {{than that of the}} urban population for groups having similar income. The proportion of families having a household water supply system is comparable in the higher-income rural population and the lower-income urban population. Families without a household water supply system spend a considerable amount of time getting water. For poorer families, this implies additional costs. Low-income families that lack a household water supply spend as much money on water as do families with better income. Access to household water disinfection methods is very limited among poor families due to its relatively high cost, which results in poorer drinking water quality in the lower-income population. Conclusions. <b>Multi-purpose</b> household <b>surveys</b> conducted from the consumer's point of view are important tools for research on equity and health, especially when studying unequal access to, use of, and expenditures on drinking water. It is recommended that countries improve their portion of the surveys that deals with water and sanitation in order to facilitate national health assessments and the establishment of more equitable subsidy programs...|$|R
40|$|Background A {{representative}} sample of the adults in England, Scotland and Wales was interviewed to estimate levels of use of complementary or alternative medicines (CAMs) and their socio-economic correlates. Methods The Omnibus <b>survey</b> is a <b>multi-purpose</b> <b>survey</b> {{carried out in the}} United Kingdom by the Office for National Statistics on behalf of non-profit making organizations. The survey is carried out in 2 out of 3 months each quarter using a stratified random, probability sample of households. An eight-question module was added to the interview schedule of the survey in March 2001. Topics included practitioner-based use of 23 named CAM therapies in the past 12 months. The resulting data were analysed in conjunction with socio-economic and demographic variables. Results A response rate of 65 per cent (1794 / 2761) was achieved. An estimated 10. 0 per cent of the population [95 per cent confidence interval (CI) 8. 7 – 11. 5 per cent] had received any CAM therapy from a practitioner in the past year. No individual therapy was used by more than 2 per cent of the sample. An estimated 6. 5 per cent (95 per cent CI 5. 4 – 7. 6) had used one of the five main therapies: acupuncture, homeopathy, chiropractic, osteopathy or herbal medicine. Estimates of CAM use were similar in England, Scotland and Wales. There was a significant positive association between CAM use and non-manual social class (p 0. 002), age left full-time education (p < 0. 001), and gross income over £ 15 600 (p < 0. 001). More than half (52 per cent) of the respondents that had used CAM in the past year had not told their general practitioner. Conclusions Strong correlations between the use of CAM and gross socio-economic indicators are demonstrated in the survey. Repeated national surveys of this type could pro-vide a useful vehicle for collecting information about chang-ing patterns of CAM use on a routine basis...|$|R

Large-scale surveys can be an important part of a portfolio of evaluation methods, but sufficient time must be given to data collection agencies if a high-quality longitudinal survey is expected.

The answers are especially important since asset ownership and access impact the form of coping mechanisms and income earnings of men and women, hence on their individual well-being as well as the longer term well-being of the household. This paper joins in the recent efforts in the literature in investigating gender differences in asset ownership and depletion. In particular, we explore analytically and empirically this type of gender inequality among 135 couples, with and without dependents using quantitative and qualitative data drawn from a random sample of 152 urban, low-income households in Bangkok (Thailand) in 2002. The <b>multi-purpose</b> <b>survey</b> included information {{at the level of the}} individual respondent on accumulated tangible or physical assets as well as the status of those owned assets six months later. Both husband and wife were interviewed separately and the data gathered from the multi-visit interviews include pertinent household and individual information, employment, credit as well as household decision making issues, division of tasks and earnings allocation for various expenses. Tobit and probit tests are used to examine the varied factors that may affect the gendered pattern of asset depletion and whether there are any significant differences in asset depletion between men and women in the same households. In addition, two probit models are estimated in order to determine the effects of various individual and household characteristics on the probability of pawning or selling real assets and more specifically, business-related assets. The empirical results demonstrate that, alongside gender equality in employment opportunities and earnings, there is need to raise the importance of and promote advocacy for gender equality in wealth and assets, both public as well as private, and for policy interventions that addresses the gender-wealth gap. ...|$|R
40|$|Households are dynamic {{while most}} surveys only collect {{information}} on {{individuals who are}} present at a single point in time. We exploit a unique and thorough household membership enumeration in Burkina Faso to consider the analytical costs of the typical static household roster. We document that households are extremely fluid with 10 percent of individuals spending sometime away over a three year period, averaging 16 of the 36 months away. The residency status of persons age 16 to 24 is most in flux. A more complete enumeration offers substantial analytical richness that {{is especially important for}} the analysis of issues that are intertwined with who is present in the household, such as the measurement of income inequality and the nature of sibling interactions in education decisions. We find that evidence of sibling rivalry in Burkina Faso appears to owe to the correlation between the presence of sisters in a household and nonagricultural income. We argue for more detailed and thorough measurement of household composition in future <b>multi-purpose</b> household <b>surveys.</b> sibling rivalry, Lorenz curves, household composition, schooling...|$|R
40|$|Employment is {{the main}} source of income for most {{families}} in the world. While it is certainly not a new dimension of well-being, it is sometimes forgotten in human development studies and poverty reduction policies or, at least, not considered in the depth it deserves. This paper proposes seven indicators of employment to be added to <b>multi-purpose</b> household <b>surveys</b> that, we argue, are crucial to a comprehensive understanding of causes and implications of poverty around the world. Traditional approaches to labour market indicators present two main weaknesses. First, in most cases, they are not as relevant in the developing world as they are in developed economies, and hence do not provide an accurate picture of labour markets in these countries. Second, surveys that collect a broader set of questions on employment do not always include extensive questions on the household and its members. The indicators proposed are: informal employment; income from employment (including self-employment earnings); occupational hazard; under/over-employment; multiple activities; and discouraged unemployment. The aim is to complement "traditional" indicators to provide a deeper understanding of both {{the quantity and quality of}} employment...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{develops a}} new approach that enables policy-makers to analyze welfare gains from improvements {{in the quality of}} infrastructure services in developing countries where data are limited and supply is subject to interruptions. With the tight budgetary constraints that usually exist, {{it is important to be}} able to prioritize public sector investments on the basis of expected benefits. However, policy analysts are rarely able to measure the benefits of improving the quality of infrastructure services, even though they may yield large welfare benefits. The most frequently cited reason for failures to carry out such welfare analysis is the scarcity of data on service quality. The main contribution of this dissertation is a new model of welfare evaluation of changes in the quality of infrastructure services. This model is estimated using the existing data from household energy surveys or data from the energy sections of <b>multi-purpose</b> household <b>surveys.</b> Potential applications of this model range from ex-ante reform evaluation to ex-post monitoring of policy outcomes, which makes this approach a useful contribution to policy analysis and to the literature on welfare evaluation of quality changes in infrastructure...|$|R

To {{identify}} and evaluate inequities in access to drinking water services as re-flected in household per capita expenditure on water, {{and to determine}} what proportion of household expenditures is spent on water in 11 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. Methods. Using data from <b>multi-purpose</b> household <b>surveys</b> (such as the Living Standards Measurement Survey Study) conducted in 11 countries from 1995 to 1999, the availability of drinking water as well as total and per capita household expenditures on drinking water were analyzed in light of socioeconomic parameters, such as urban vs. rural setting, household in-come, type and regularity of water supply service, time spent obtaining water in homes not served by running water, and type of water-purifying treatment, if any. Results. Access to drinking water as well as total and per capita household expenditures on drinking water show an association with household income, economic conditions of the house-hold, and location. The access of the rural population to drinking water services is much more restricted {{than that of the}} urban population for groups having similar income. The proportion of families having a household water supply system is comparable in the higher-income rural population and the lower-income urban population. Families without a household water sup...|$|R
40|$|The European Community Household Panel (ECHP) is a {{standardized}} <b>multi-purpose</b> annual longitudinal <b>survey</b> {{carried out at}} the level of the European Union. It is centrally designed and coordinated by the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat), and covers demographics, labor force behavior, income, health, education and training, housing, migration, etc. After reviewing the organization of the survey, this paper discusses some of the issues that an applied economist potentially interested in the ECHP may face when trying to deal with these data. In particular, the paper focuses on survey attrition and nonresponse, the weighting procedures with which Eurostat tries to compensate for differential nonresponse and attrition rates, and the imputation methods adopted by Eurostat in order to deal with item nonresponse.

25|$|There are {{few studies}} on the {{affordability}} of water and sewer bills in Latin America. The Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) analyzed <b>multi-purpose</b> household <b>surveys</b> conducted between 1995 and 1999 in 10 countries to assess the share of household income spent on water supply services. These data show that the expenditures on water vary between 0.4% of total expenditures in rural Panama to 3.0% in Kingston, Jamaica. For the households in the poorest income decile expenditures on water are higher, varying from 0.6% in rural Panama to 6.5% in Kingston, Jamaica. However, these figures have to be interpreted with caution. First, {{it is not clear}} how water expenditures were defined in the surveys. It seems that in some cases expenditures to buy bottled water and water from tankers were included, while in other cases they were excluded. Second, the sample includes both households with and without access to piped water systems. Therefore, especially in rural areas where coverage tends to be low, the shares are only a poor indication on the affordability of water bills. Third, it is not explicit if sewer bills are included in the analysis, although this is most likely the case, since sewer bills are always a surcharge on the water bill and are thus perceived by most households as part of their water expenditures.|$|R
