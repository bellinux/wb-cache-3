5|$|The episode {{begins with}} an {{announcement}} by Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) on television {{that he plans to}} travel to outer space, and is willing to pay up to thirty million dollars to do so. Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) agrees to help Tracy with his dream of traveling in space, promising to call his friends at NASA. Instead of doing this, however, he asks The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) to create a fake space experience for Tracy. Pete and the TGS crew construct a <b>model</b> <b>space</b> shuttle and place Tracy in it after disorienting him by flying him in a helicopter blindfolded. The deception is a success, and Tracy believes that he is, in fact, flying in space.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a component <b>modeling</b> <b>space</b> as {{a context for}} supporting component-based software development and accumulating component-related knowledge. The <b>modeling</b> <b>space</b> is structured in three dimensions: A representation dimension that ranges from the languages of problem domains to computer processor languages; a composition dimension that supports a repeating pattern of the wholepart, or system-component, hierarchy; and a generalization dimension that supports reuse of models and components. Also integrated into the <b>modeling</b> <b>space</b> are an interaction model of components and connectors, an approach to component specification, and a provision for relating models via mappings. Each of these elements is characterized as applying in a uniform way throughout the <b>modeling</b> <b>space.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|An {{intuitive}} {{interpretation of}} the Cartan connection in this form is that it determines a fracturing of the tautological principal bundle associated to a Klein geometry. Thus Cartan geometries are deformed analogues of Klein geometries. This deformation is roughly a prescription for attaching {{a copy of the}} <b>model</b> <b>space</b> G/H to each point of M and thinking of that <b>model</b> <b>space</b> as being tangent to (and infinitesimally identical with) the manifold at a point of contact. The fibre of the tautological bundle G → G/H of the Klein geometry at the point of contact is then identified with the fibre of the bundle P. Each such fibre (in G) carries a Maurer-Cartan form for G, and the Cartan connection is a way of assembling these Maurer-Cartan forms gathered from the points of contact into a coherent 1-form η defined on the whole bundle. The fact that only elements of H contribute to the Maurer-Cartan equation Ad(h)R'h*η = η has the intuitive interpretation that any other elements of G would move the <b>model</b> <b>space</b> away from the point of contact, and so no longer be tangent to the manifold.|$|E
25|$|As, in {{the general}} case, the theory linking data with model {{parameters}} is nonlinear, the posterior probability in the <b>model</b> <b>space</b> may {{not be easy to}} describe (it may be multimodal, some moments may not be defined, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Differential geometers in {{the late}} 19th and early 20th century were very {{interested}} in using model families such as planes or spheres to describe the geometry of surfaces. A family of model spaces attached to each point of a surface S is called a congruence: in the previous examples there is a canonical choice of such a congruence. A Cartan connection provides an identification between the model spaces in the congruence along any curve in S. An important feature of these identifications is that the point of contact of the <b>model</b> <b>space</b> with S always moves with the curve. This generic condition is characteristic of Cartan connections.|$|E

25|$|A {{small number}} of toys and models were {{produced}}. During 1978, Corgi Toys produced a two inch long die-cast model of Liberator with a transparent rear globe.

Also during 1979, Blue Box Toys produced three space vehicle toys that featured the series logo; however, these had never appeared in the television programme. Comet Miniatures produced a nine-inch long injection-moulded model kit of Liberator in 1989, which contained many parts.

40|$|International audienceModel-Based Engineering (MBE) and Product Line Engineering (PLE) {{have been}} combined, to handle new system {{development}} constraints like: increasing complexity, higher product quality and cost reduction.

2500|$|Cartan {{connections}} {{are closely related}} to pseudogroup structures on a manifold. [...] Each is thought of as modelled on a Klein geometry G/H, {{in a manner similar to}} the way in which Riemannian geometry is modelled on Euclidean space. [...] On a manifold M, one imagines attaching to each point of M a copy of the <b>model</b> <b>space</b> G/H. [...] The symmetry of the <b>model</b> <b>space</b> is then built into the Cartan geometry or pseudogroup structure by positing that the model spaces of nearby points are related by a transformation in G. [...] The fundamental difference between a Cartan geometry and pseudogroup geometry is that the symmetry for a Cartan geometry relates infinitesimally close points by an infinitesimal transformation in G (i.e., an element of the Lie algebra of G) and the analogous notion of symmetry for a pseudogroup structure applies for points that are physically separated within the manifold.|$|E
2500|$|The Cartan {{geometry}} of S {{consists of a}} copy of the <b>model</b> <b>space</b> G/H at each point of S (with a marked point of contact) together with a notion of [...] "parallel transport" [...] along curves which identifies these copies using elements of G.

2500|$|The {{general theory}} of {{conformal}} geometry is similar, although with some differences, {{in the cases of}} Euclidean and pseudo-Euclidean signature.

2500|$|Since α is a {{principal}} connection, it induces a connection on any associated bundle to Q. In particular, the bundle Q G G/H of homogeneous spaces over M, whose fibers are copies of the <b>model</b> <b>space</b> G/H, has a connection.

The fiber of [...] over x in M {{may be viewed as}} the tangent space at s(x) to the fiber of Q G G/H over x.

Since this identification of tangent spaces is induced by the connection, the marked points given by s always move under parallel transport.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{important}} motivations for studying differentiable manifolds within this abstract framework. [...] First, there is no a priori reason that the <b>model</b> <b>space</b> needs to be Rn. [...] For example, (in particular in algebraic geometry), one could take this to be the space of complex numbers Cn equipped with the sheaf of holomorphic functions (thus arriving at the spaces of complex analytic geometry), or the sheaf of polynomials (thus arriving at the spaces of interest in complex algebraic geometry). [...] In broad terms, this concept can be adapted for any suitable notion of a scheme (see topos theory). [...] Second, coordinates are no longer explicitly necessary to the construction. [...] The analog of a coordinate system is the pair , but these merely quantify the idea of local isomorphism rather than being central to the discussion (as in the case of charts and atlases). [...] Third, the sheaf OM is not manifestly a sheaf of functions at all. [...] Rather, it emerges as a sheaf of functions {{as a consequence of the}} construction (via the quotients of local rings by their maximal ideals). [...] Hence it is a more primitive definition of the structure (see synthetic differential geometry).|$|E
