5|$|Cyclonic Storm Komen was {{an unusual}} {{tropical}} cyclone that originated near the southern coast of Bangladesh and later struck the same country while drifting over the northern Bay of Bengal. The second named storm of the 2015 season, Komen brought several days of heavy rainfall to Myanmar, Bangladesh, and India. It formed as a depression on July26 over the Ganges delta and <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> circular motion around the northern Bay of Bengal. Komen intensified into a 75km/h (45mph) cyclonic storm and moved ashore southeastern Bangladesh on July30. The system turned westward over land and was last noted over eastern India on August2.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century {{there was a}} school for poor children, which <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{four-year}} cycle between Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys, Bryncroes and Y Rhiw. The Elementary Education Act 1870 provided for local school boards, but was opposed by the established church. The process of establishing boards was lengthy, and the government had to enforce the regulations in Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw; the national school opened at Y Rhiw in 1877 and had 74 pupils on its register; it closed in 1965.|$|E

However, this plan was quickly overtaken by events as the supply C-130s coming into Pochentong were used for evacuees on the return journey, quickly reducing the number of evacuees that would need to be <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> final evacuation.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after its}} peak, Tropical Storm Aletta began to weaken. However, the {{tropical}} cyclone managed to maintain winds of 50mph (85km/h) for 30 hours before resuming a weakening trend. While the steering currents weakened on May25, Aletta slowed and <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large clockwise loop until May28. Shortly thereafter, Tropical Storm Aletta was downgraded into a depression. Tropical Depression Aletta dissipated on May29 roughly 180mi (290km/h) southwest of Acapulco.|$|E

5|$|A {{vigorous}} upper-level low developed west of Alberto on August 7 and August 8. This {{caused an}} increase in vertical shear, weakening the hurricane down to a tropical storm on August 9. The low also caused the storm {{to turn to the}} northwest. However, on August 10, Alberto became better organised and was upgraded to hurricane status again. It then <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gradual curve towards the north and northeast through a break in a subtropical ridge between August 11 and August 12. Alberto made its closest approach to Bermuda on August 11, passing about 345mi (555km) east of the island. The strong storm became a Category3 major hurricane on August 12 and reached its second and highest peak intensity of 125mph (205km/h), and a 60mi (95km) wide eye was observed. Alberto was an unusual storm in that it reached its peak intensity at a high latitude, north of 35˚N, after it had re-curved. The hurricane began to weaken due to increasing upper-level westerlies on August 13 and August 14, while moving east-northeastward. Alberto was downgraded to a tropical storm on August 14.|$|E
5|$|Compton asked {{theoretical}} physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer of the University of California, Berkeley, to {{take over}} research into fast neutron calculations—the key to calculations of critical mass and weapon detonation—from Gregory Breit, who had quit on 18 May 1942 because of concerns over lax operational security. John H. Manley, a physicist at the Metallurgical Laboratory, was assigned to assist Oppenheimer by contacting and coordinating experimental physics groups scattered across the country. Oppenheimer and Robert Serber of the University of Illinois examined the problems of neutron diffusion—how neutrons <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nuclear chain reaction—and hydrodynamics—how the explosion produced by a chain reaction might behave. To review this work and {{the general theory of}} fission reactions, Oppenheimer and Fermi convened meetings at the University of Chicago in June and at the University of California, Berkeley, in July 1942 with theoretical physicists Hans Bethe, John Van Vleck, Edward Teller, Emil Konopinski, Robert Serber, Stan Frankel, and Eldred C. Nelson, the latter three former students of Oppenheimer, and experimental physicists Emilio Segrè, Felix Bloch, Franco Rasetti, John Henry Manley, and Edwin McMillan. They tentatively confirmed that a fission bomb was theoretically possible.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Otis was a {{moderate}} hurricane that threatened the Baja California Peninsula but dissipated before landfall. Otis developed on September 28, 2005, off the western coast of Mexico, from a tropical wave {{that emerged from}} the western coast of Africa and traversed the Atlantic Ocean during the preceding several weeks. After attaining tropical storm status on September 29, the storm <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> generally northwestward direction for most of its duration. It ultimately peaked at Category 2 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale before beginning to weaken. The storm degenerated into a tropical depression on October 3 and dissipated fully on October 5, near the coast of Baja California Sur. Preparations for the storm were completed on the Peninsula; tropical cyclone watches and warnings were declared and numerous shelters opened. However, the storm's effects were minimal, and limited to gusty winds with heavy rainfall. No major damage was reported.|$|E

5|$|On 1 March, Cyclone Erica formed {{offshore}} Queensland {{and strengthened}} as it <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> parabolic path, {{before leaving the}} Australian region on 12 March. Erica caused only minor damage in Queensland. Cyclone Craig originated offshore Northern Territory on 8 March. The system subsequently struck the territory and eventually made another landfall in Queensland on 12 March, after crossing the Gulf of Carpentaria. Impact from Craig was generally minor. Cyclone Inigo formed on 30 March and caused severe impact in Indonesia, especially in Flores, Sumba, and West Timor. Inigo later deepened into the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Australian region, tied with Cyclone Gwenda in 1999. Inigo weakened significantly before striking Western Australia on 8 April and dissipating shortly thereafter. The final system, Tropical Cyclone Epi developed east of Papua New Guinea on 5 June and dissipated on the following day. Overall, the tropical cyclones of this season caused 60deaths and about $12million (2003USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|On land, {{the river}} otter can walk, run, bound, or slide. Foot falls during walking and running follow the {{sequence}} of left limb, right limb, right limb, left limb. During walking, the limbs are <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> plane parallel to the long axis of the body. Bounding {{is the result of}} simultaneous lifting of the limbs off the ground. As the front feet make contact with the ground, the back feet are lifted and land where the front paws first contacted the ground, producing a pattern of tracks in pairs typical of most mustelids. Sliding occurs mostly on even surfaces of snow or ice, but can also occur on grassy slopes and muddy banks. Sliding across snow and ice is a rapid and efficient means of travel, and otters traveling over mountain passes, between drainages, or descending from mountain lakes often slide continuously for several hundred meters. Rear leg paddling enables continuous sliding where gravity is an insufficient or an opposing force. During winter, the river otters heavily use openings in the ice, and may excavate passages in beaver dams for accessing open water.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{a larger}} {{conflict}} known as the Halloween War, the fight started after a single player controlling a space station in the star system B-R5RB accidentally failed to make a scheduled in-game routine maintenance payment which made the system (a key staging area used by N3/PL in the war) highly vulnerable to capture. The CFC and Russian coalitions began pouring players into the system in a swift offensive, and N3/PL <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large fleet of players as a response as well. A massive battle erupted {{in the system and}} numerous smaller engagements occurred throughout the game universe as players attempted to block reinforcements from joining the battle. CFC/Rus gained a clear win by inflicting heavy losses on N3/PL and successfully capturing B-R5RB. The losses totaled 576 capital ships including 75 Titans (the largest ships available to players), along with thousands of smaller vessels.|$|E

5|$|The 1910Cuba hurricane, {{popularly known}} as the Cyclone of the Five Days, was an unusual and {{destructive}} tropical cyclone that struck Cuba and the United States in October1910. It formed in the southern Caribbean on October9 and strengthened as it moved northwestward, becoming a hurricane on October 12. After crossing the western tip of Cuba, it peaked in intensity on October16, corresponding to Category4 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. That same day, the hurricane <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> counterclockwise loop and hit Cuba again. It then tracked toward Florida, landing near Cape Romano. After moving through the state, it hugged {{the coast of the}} Southeastern United States on its way out to sea.|$|E
5|$|The Congregation elected Vermigli abbot of {{the monastery}} at San Pietro ad Aram, Naples in 1537. There he became acquainted with Juan de Valdés, {{a leader of the}} spirituali movement. Valdés {{introduced}} Vermigli to the writings of Protestant reformers. Toward the end of his time in Naples, he read Martin Bucer's commentaries on the Gospels and the Psalms, and Zwingli's De vera et falsa religione. Reading these works was an act of ecclesiastical defiance, but not an uncommon one in reformist circles. Vermigli seems to have slowly <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Protestant direction primarily through study of the Bible and the Church Fathers, especially Augustine. He probably read Protestant literature critically; it was common for those in reform-minded circles to do so while remaining in the Catholic Church. Vermigli embraced the Protestant doctrine of justification by faith alone during this time, and he had probably rejected the traditional Catholic view of the sacraments. Vermigli also seems to have influenced Valdés. Scholars believe that Valdés's strong doctrine of double predestination, that God has chosen some people for salvation and others for damnation, was learned from Vermigli. Vermigli in turn had acquired it from his study of Gregory of Rimini at Padua.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of Hurricane Ophelia is attributed {{in part to}} a low-latitude tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa in mid-September. As the wave tracked westward, it began to interact with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and was subsequently introduced with a low chance of tropical development in the National Hurricane Center's (NHC) 48-hour Tropical Weather Outlook. Though atmospheric wind shear was only marginally favorable, the cloud pattern organized, and a surface low-pressure area developed in association with the disturbance. Deep shower and thunderstorm activity continued to fire as the disturbance <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> general westward motion, and it was assessed with a high chance of development by early on September19. Following satellite trends and data from the Advanced Scatterometer, the disturbance was upgraded to a tropical depression at 1800UTC the following day, while positioned roughly 1300mi (2090km) east of the Lesser Antilles, and to a tropical storm six hours later.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Tropical Depression Two {{can be traced}} back to a disorganized {{tropical}} wave that was first noted by the NHC on June 24 as it moved off the western coast of Africa, and into the Atlantic Ocean. Moving towards the west, the wave showed no signs of organization until July3 as it entered the western Caribbean Sea. During the 24hours that followed, it continued to coalesce, and the NHC subsequently increased the disturbance's chance of developing into a tropical cyclone. A defined surface circulation did not form as a result of the wave's movement over the Yucatan Peninsula, and the system lost organization. The system remained disorganized as it traversed the peninsula and eventually emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on July7. Situated over water once more, the wave was able to gradually develop as it <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> northwesterly direction. Following a reconnaissance mission, the NHC noted in their Tropical Weather Outlook that there was a high chance of the system developing into a tropical cyclone within the next 48hours.|$|E
5|$|The third storm {{developed}} in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on September20. It tracked along the East Coast of the United States, causing widespread damage, particularly in Florida. A fourth storm was first observed in the northwestern Caribbean Sea on September25. This storm <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> semicircular path around Cuba and was last noted offshore Florida four days later. Minor wind and flood damage was reported in Cuba. On October9, the fifth hurricane of the season was located near the Windward Islands. Moving westward, the storm eventually curved northeastward while crossing the Caribbean Sea, causing it to strike Cuba. Minor damage was reported on the island, though a ship sank with 230people aboard; 42of them were rescued, while the remaining 188were presumed dead. The final observed system {{developed in}} the vicinity of the Bahamas on October23. It later struck the Outer Banks of North Carolina; the storm caused severe flooding in southeastern Virginia, with six deaths reported. It was last noted on October29.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Josephine was {{the tenth}} {{tropical}} storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. Josephine developed {{out of a}} strong tropical wave which moved off the African coast on August31. The wave quickly became organized and was declared Tropical Depression Ten while located 170mi (270km) to the south-southeast of the Cape Verde Islands on September2. The depression was quickly upgraded to Tropical Storm Josephine around noon the same day. Over the next several days, Josephine <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> general west-northwest direction and reached its peak intensity early on September3. Strong wind shear, some due to the outflow of Hurricane Ike, and dry air caused the storm to weaken. On September6, the combination of wind shear, dry air, and cooling waters caused Josephine to weaken into a tropical depression. Josephine deteriorated into a remnant low shortly after as convection continued to dissipate around the storm. The low ultimately dissipated while located 520mi (835km) east of Guadeloupe on September10. However, the remnant moisture led to minor flooding {{on the island of}} St. Croix.|$|E
