5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{learns that}} Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{will be taking}} {{a leave of absence}} to go on jury duty for the Scranton Strangler trial, leading the {{corporate}} office to send Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) to cover for him. Michael forces Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to plan a second, classier Christmas party on the day Holly returns to Scranton. Michael welcomes Holly back, but becomes upset when she tells him that she and A.J. (Rob Huebel) are still in a relationship. Holly then tells the women of the office that she's giving A.J. an ultimatum: either propose to her by year's end or their relationship is over. Michael lies to Holly and tells her that he's seeing a woman named Tara from New York, and Holly shows curiosity, but Michael interprets this as potential jealousy. When Michael gets further upset over hearing about Holly's relationship with A.J., he takes her toy Woody from Toy Story—a present from A.J.—throws it in the trash, and pours his coffee on it. When Holly demands to know who did it, Michael comes forward and admits that he still has feelings for her and is hurt that, while they had to break up due to their long distance, she is nevertheless able to make such an arrangement work with A.J. This, in turn, <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> bad for Michael. A.J. arrives in Scranton to surprise Holly and Michael welcomes him politely. After cleaning Holly's Woody, he leaves the office and Pam follows him out, where he breaks down. In order to lift his spirits, Pam tells him about Holly's ultimatum, suggesting their relationship is not going to last very long. He returns to the party where he overhears Holly and A.J. talking about Woody, with Holly fabricating a story to cover for Michael's actions.|$|E

Duplock has stated that: [...] "One thing that was quite difficult for me to get right was the idea that she didn't want sex. It's Whitney's way of keeping Tony happy. If she lets him do it, then he's nicer to her and he <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> special." [...] Research highlighted the fact that 12% of abused children go on to become abusers in turn, however Duplock explained: [...] "We felt that to imply on TV that someone who has been abused {{is going to go on}} to abuse other people is not a message you want to give out. Those people have been through enough." [...] Narducci for the NSPCC stated that importance was placed on making children viewing the show [...] "feel comfortable about asking for help if they felt they needed it [...] for the wider community - to recognise the signs and let them know that they can do something about it.

Several times throughout the series, she jams with Finn and Jake, and various others depending on the circumstances.

500|$|Scholars such as Catherine Rottenberg {{examine how}} Larsen’s {{characters}} struggle against {{race and gender}} norms of [...] "whiteness" [...] in the United States. Rottenberg shows how the main characters in the novel confront normative characteristics of white culture. Clare, who is of mixed race, choses {{to identify with the}} white culture. Irene, who identifies as an African American, choses to pass when she feels the need to blend into white culture. The essence of Rottenberg's scholarship shows how the novel's characters struggle against the desire for whiteness because of the positive stereotypes society has created around [...] "white" [...] identity. Clare's experience growing up with her white aunts, who treated her as a servant, directly impacts Clare's initial desire towards whiteness. Hence, she passes as a white woman, marries a white man, and forgets her African American culture. Even though as a society the white race is the desirable race, Rottenberg explains how there are limitations put into place so the inferior race can never fully be white. [...] For example, Clare has this desire to pass as a white woman because she believes that is the only way she will have a social power, but after reconnecting with her childhood friend Irene, she begins to struggle with her misplaced desire for whiteness and returns to her African American identification. Seeing Irene sparks a desire in Clare to get back in touch with her African American culture. Similarly, Irene identifies as black, but because she desires to feel safe and in control at all times in her life , she chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene's desire to be white comes from her wanting the middle-class lifestyle because it will give her the security she needs. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation, which in a way, <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> like her marriage and the life she knows at risk. Throughout Larsen's novel Rottenberg explains how Clare has evolved from wanting to achieve whiteness to reconnecting with the African American culture, while Irene still has a desire to achieve [...] "whiteness" [...] for the feel secure.|$|E

While he proclaimed to his kingdom that he had found the entire sword, Arthur, like Merlin, only spoke in half truths, as the King left out the part about the sword being split in half, after he shows a portion from the case. He even tells Guinevere that he has studied the translations of the Camarthen Scroll, which contain the three elements: the star, the eye, and the sun, but he can't decipher the clues.

Questioning the symbolism of the mysterious useless box Gloria finds, he felt that it [...] "felt targeted: Who would build such a useless machine? Every time you turn it on, it turns itself off. Does it represent Gloria’s feelings toward technology? That it’s more trouble than it’s worth? Is it a message left for her by someone — Ray Wise’s omnipresent frequent flier, Paul Marrane?
