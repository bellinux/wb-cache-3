40|$|Abstract. There are {{increasing}} demands for polymer based microfluidic devices as polymer devices can be mass produced using the injection molding process for disposable analytical applications. However, fabrication of precision injection molds with micro features down {{to tens of}} micro meters is a challenging task. The most efficient manufacturing method {{for this type of}} high precision micro mold is the tool-based micro machining. In this paper, studies have been conducted to develop <b>metal</b> <b>injection</b> <b>mould</b> manufacturing technologies for polymer microfluidic device fabrication. An <b>injection</b> <b>mould</b> with a micro feature of 29 µm wall thickness, 20 µm height and 9. 8 mm length has been successfully achieved on brass with very precise dimensional accuracy and surface quality for molding process of polymer microfluidic devices.

40|$|In {{the present}} research, it was {{established}} that the weight properties of an already sintered MIM part which {{are influenced by the}} <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> machine parameters, could be predicted by adapting a back propagation artificial neuronal network. With a statistical evaluation of experimental data gathered from 68 process parameters of each prepared samples and the related final weight of the parts, an artificial neuronal network can be trained to generate a mathematical model for quality prediction. The correlation analysis revealed that the proposed model almost consider strong complex interactions between the single process variables and the weight of the moulded parts. This generated model permits an online quality control of <b>metal</b> <b>injection</b> <b>moulded</b> parts and the detection of any variations in the process conditions.

50|$|Several metal {{consolidation}} {{techniques are}} used to produce the final product. <b>Metal</b> <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> (MIM) otherwise known as powder injection moulding is a well-established and cost-effective method of fabricating small-to-moderate size metal components in large quantities. It {{is derived from the}} method plastic injection moulding, whereby mixing of a metal powder with a polymer binder forms the feedstock, which is then injected into a mould, after which the binder is removed via heat treatment under vacuum before final sintering. With titanium however, the binders used in MIM results in the introduction of carbon into the matrix due to insufficient binder removal prior to sintering and/or deleterious reactions between the decomposing binder, the debinding atmosphere, and the metal phase. This results in titanium parts with mechanical properties unsuited for critical aerospace applications, but suitable for parts where tensile and impact properties are less important. Recently, work has been carried out to reduce the binder to < 8% volume fraction, resulting in the complete removal of the binder from the moulded component during heat treatment.|$|E

Metal plastic hybrid structures are an efficient solution to use the best material at every place. The current states of the art for the manufacturing of metal plastic composites are three technologies: the insert technology, the outsert technology and the metal plastic hybrid technology. In all technologies the metal parts were produced separately from the plastic parts. The <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> process is only used for forming the plastic parts and for joining.

They demonstrate outstanding specific compression strengths, very high specific compression energy absorption capability, are tight against infiltration by fluids even at higher pressures and can be coated using techniques which are more common for compact materials like anodizing, copper- and chromium-plating. Corrosion properties of aluminium and zinc syntactic foams were tested by electrochemical potential measurements, immersion tests and long-time out-door exposure and determined {{to be close to}} those of compact alloys. Several approaches have been performed by IFAM for the production of these materials, e. g. by infiltration of sintered glass bubbles preforms with aluminium and zinc alloys using squeeze casting or gas-pressure infiltration of sintered preforms with aluminium.
