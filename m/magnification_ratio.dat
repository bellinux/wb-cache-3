40|$|We {{investigate}} the weak lensing effects of line-of-sight structures on quadruple images in quasar-galaxy strong lens systems based on N-body and ray-tracing simulations that can resolve halos {{with a mass}} of 10 ^ 5 solar mass. The intervening halos and voids disturb the <b>magnification</b> <b>ratios</b> of lensed images {{as well as their}} relative positions due to lensing. The <b>magnification</b> <b>ratios</b> typically change by O(10 %) when the shifts of relative angular positions of lensed images are constrained to < 0. 004 arcsec. The constrained amplitudes of projected density perturbations due to line-of-sight structures are O(10 ^ 8) solar mass per arcsec^ 2. These results are consistent with our new analytical estimate based on the two-point correlation of density fluctuations. The observed mid-infrared (MIR) flux ratios for 6 quasar-galaxy lens systems with quadruple images agree well with the numerically estimated values without taking into account of subhalos residing in the lensing galaxies. We find that the constrained mean amplitudes of projected density perturbations in the line-of-sight are negative, which suggests that the fluxes of lensed images are perturbed mainly by minivoids and minihalos in underdense regions. We derive a new fitting formula for estimating the probability distribution function of magnification perturbation. We also find that the mean amplitude of magnification perturbation roughly equals the standard deviation regardless of the model parameters.

40|$|Observations of early-type galaxies, both in {{the local}} {{universe}} and in clusters at medium redshifts, suggest that these galaxies often contain discs or disc-like structures. Using fits to the two dimensional light profile of galaxies in the cluster CL 1358 + 62 obtained by Kelson et al. (2000) as model templates, we investigate the effect of disc structures on the lensing properties of early-type galaxies. Statistical properties, like magnification cross sections and the expected number of four-image/quad lens systems, are not affected greatly by the inclusion of discs that contain less than ∼ 10 per cent of the total stellar mass. However, the properties of individual lens systems are affected. We estimate that 10 − 30 per cent of all four-image/quad lens systems, with early-type deflector galaxies, would be affected measurably {{by the presence of}} disc components.

40|$|We {{present the}} first year of Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the unique {{supernova}} (SN) "Refsdal," a gravitationally lensed SN at z = 1. 488 ± 0. 001 with multiple images behind the galaxy cluster MACS J 1149. 6 + 2223. The first four observed images of SN Refsdal (images S 1 –S 4) exhibited a slow rise (over ~ 150 days) to reach a broad peak brightness around 2015 April 20. Using a set of light curve templates constructed from SN 1987 A-like peculiar Type II SNe, we measure time delays for the four images relative to S 1 of 4 ± 4 (for S 2), 2 ± 5 (S 3), and 24 ± 7 days (S 4). The measured <b>magnification</b> <b>ratios</b> relative to S 1 are 1. 15 ± 0. 05 (S 2), 1. 01 ± 0. 04 (S 3), and 0. 34 ± 0. 02 (S 4). None of the template light curves fully captures the photometric behavior of SN Refsdal, so we also derive complementary measurements for these parameters using polynomials to represent the intrinsic light curve shape. These more flexible fits deliver fully consistent time delays of 7 ± 2 (S 2), 0. 6 ± 3 (S 3), and 27 ± 8 days (S 4).

The standard elliptical isothermal lens mass profile is not compatible with a substructure surface density of < 280 M/pc^ 2 at the 95 % confidence level. This is 4 - 7 % of the galaxy's surface density (depending on which image position is used to evaluate this).

40|$|We {{develop a}} new {{approach}} to extracting model-independent information from observations of strong gravitational lenses. The approach is based on the generic properties of images near the fold and cusp catastrophes in caustics and critical curves. Observables used are the relative image positions, the <b>magnification</b> <b>ratios</b> and ellipticities of extended images, and time delays between images with temporally varying intensity. We show how these observables constrain derivatives and ratios of derivatives of the lensing potential near a critical curve. Based on these measured properties of the lensing potential, classes of parametric lens models can then easily be restricted to such parameter values compatible with the measurements, thus allowing fast scans of large varieties of models. Applying our approach to a representative galaxy (JVAS B 1422 + 231) and a galaxy-cluster lens (MACS J 1149. 5 + 2223), we show which model-independent information can be extracted in those cases and demonstrate that the parameters obtained by our approach for known parametric lens models agree well with those found by detailed model fitting.

We develop a method of deconvolution of contributions of two images of the source into the gamma-ray band flaring lightcurve. We use this method to study the evolution of the <b>magnification</b> factor <b>ratio</b> between the two images throughout the flaring episodes. We interpret the time variability of the ratio as a signature of the microlensing effect and derive constraints on the physical parameters of the gamma-ray source by comparing the observed variability properties of the <b>magnification</b> factor <b>ratio</b> with those derived from numerical simulations of the microlensing caustics networks. Results. We find that the <b>magnification</b> factor <b>ratio</b> has experienced a change characteristic for a microlensing caustic crossing event during a 100 d flaring period in 2012. It has further changed between 2012 and a recent flaring episode in 2014. We use the measurement of the maximal magnification and duration of the caustic crossing event to derive an estimate of the projected size of the gamma-ray emission region in B 0218 + 357, R_γ∼ 10 ^ 14 cm. This estimate is compatible with a complementary estimate found from the minimal variability time scale. The microlensing / minimal variability time scale measurements of the source size suggest that the gamma-ray emission is produced at the base of the blazar jet, in the direct vicinity of the central supermassive black hole.
