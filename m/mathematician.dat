5|$|The {{concept of}} a Taylor series was {{formulated}} by the Scottish <b>mathematician</b> James Gregory and formally introduced by the English <b>mathematician</b> Brook Taylor in 1715. If the Taylor series is centered at zero, then that series is also called a Maclaurin series, named after the Scottish <b>mathematician</b> Colin Maclaurin, who made extensive use of this special case of Taylor series in the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mathematicians</b> {{involved}} with solving problems with applications {{in real life}} are called applied <b>mathematicians.</b> Applied <b>mathematicians</b> are mathematical scientists who, with their specialized knowledge and professional methodology, approach many of the imposing problems presented in related scientific fields. With professional focus {{on a wide variety}} of problems, theoretical systems, and localized constructs, applied <b>mathematicians</b> work regularly in the study and formulation of mathematical models. <b>Mathematicians</b> and applied <b>mathematicians</b> are considered to be two of the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) careers.|$|R

5|$|Apart from {{a number}} of other books and pamphlets, Wright {{translated}} John Napier's pioneering 1614 work which introduced the idea of logarithms from Latin into English. This was published after Wright's death as A Description of the Admirable Table of Logarithmes (1616). Wright's work influenced, among other persons, Dutch astronomer and <b>mathematician</b> Willebrord Snellius; Adriaan Metius, the geometer and astronomer from Holland; and the English <b>mathematician</b> Richard Norwood, who calculated the length of a degree on a great circle of the earth using a method proposed by Wright.|$|E

German biologist and artist Ernst Haeckel painted hundreds of marine organisms to emphasise their symmetry. Scottish biologist D'Arcy Thompson pioneered the study of growth patterns in both plants and animals, showing that simple equations could explain spiral growth. In the 20th century, British <b>mathematician</b> Alan Turing predicted mechanisms of morphogenesis which give rise to patterns of spots and stripes. Hungarian biologist Aristid Lindenmayer and French American <b>mathematician</b> Benoît Mandelbrot showed how the mathematics of fractals could create plant growth patterns.|$|E

In the 9th century, the Persian <b>mathematician</b> Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī used the terms mal for a square and kahb for a cube, which later Islamic mathematicians represented in mathematical notation as m and k, respectively, by the 15th century, as seen in the work of Abū al-Hasan ibn Alī al-Qalasādī.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} two studies {{investigating}} what <b>mathematicians</b> {{value in a}} pedagogical proof. Study 1 is a qualitative study of how eight <b>mathematicians</b> revised two proofs that would be presented in a course for mathematics majors. These <b>mathematicians</b> thought that introductory and concluding sentences {{should be included in}} the proofs, main ideas should be formatted to emphasize their importance, and extraneous or redundant information should be removed to avoid distracting or confusing the reader. Study 2 is a quantitative study assessing the extent to which a larger group of <b>mathematicians</b> (N = 110) agreed or disagreed with the eight <b>mathematicians</b> interviewed in Study 1. This quantitative study confirmed the findings of Study 1 by demonstrating a high degree of agreement among <b>mathematicians</b> regarding how they would revise proofs for pedagogical purposes...|$|R

Another variation is a simple graph where two <b>mathematicians</b> are joined by an edge if and only if there is a paper with only two of them (and no others) as co-authors.|$|R
40|$|Several {{philosophers}} {{have used}} the framework of means/ends reasoning to explain the methodological choices made by scientists and <b>mathematicians</b> (see, e. g., Goldman 1999, Levi 1962, Maddy 1997). In particular, {{they have tried to}} identify the epistemic objectives of scientists and <b>mathematicians</b> that will explain these choices. In this paper, the framework of means/ends reasoning is used to study an important methodological choice made by <b>mathematicians.</b> Namely, <b>mathematicians</b> will only use deductive proofs to establish the truth of mathematical claims. In this paper, I argue that none of the epistemic objectives of <b>mathematicians</b> that are currently on the table provide a satisfactory explanation of this rejection of probabilistic proofs...|$|R
