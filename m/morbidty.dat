40|$|Drowning {{is one of}} {{the fatal}} {{accidents}} frequently encountered during the summer and is {{the most common cause of}} accidental death in the world. Anoxia, hypothermia, and metabolic acidosis are mainly responsible for <b>morbidty.</b> Cardiovascular effects may occur secondary to hypoxia and hypothermia. Atrial fibrillation, sinus dysrhythmias (rarely requiring treatment), and, in serious cases, ventricular fibrillation or asystole may develop, showing as rhythm problems on electrocardiogram and Osborn wave can be seen, especially during hypothermia. A 16 -year-old male patient who was admitted to our hospital's emergency service with drowning is presented in this article. In our case, ventricular fibrillation and giant J wave (Osborn wave) associated with hypothermia developed after drowning was seen. We present this case as a reminder of ECG changes due to hypothermia that develop after drowning. Response to cardiopulmonary resuscitation after drowning and hypothermia is not very good. Mortality is very high, so early resuscitation and aggressive treatment of cardiovascular and respiratory problems are important for life...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Penetrating chest traumas {{are one of}} {{the most}} serious {{injuries}} with clinical outcomes and patients profile. İn this study, we evaluated our clinical experience obtained from thoracotomy patients together with the related literature. Material and Methods: Records of 36 patients who were treated by thoracotomy and were admitted for penetrating thorax trauma between 2009 - 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Only the conservatively treated patients with penetrating chest trauma were excluded. Results: Thirty-two of the cases were men and 4 were women. Twenty-eight patients had sharp penetrating trauma and eight patients had gunshot wounds. Pulmonary paranchymal laceration was the most common intrathoracic pathology which was detected in 28 patients. Seven patients had extrathoracic organ injury. The most common cause of extrathoracic organ injury was liver laceration, observed in 4 patients. Cardiac injury was detected in 5 patients and mortality occurred in two patients among cardiac injury patients. <b>Morbidty</b> occurred in seven patients and the most common cause was improved atelectasis. Conclusions: Since penetrating chest trauma causes a disruption of the cardiorespiratory system in a very short time, early diagnosis and treatment is life saving. The accompanying extrathoracic injuries that cause increased mortality and morbidity rates can be minimized through a multidisciplinary approach...|$|E
40|$|Despite major {{advances}} in therapies, chronic heart failure (CHF) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are still associated with significant morbidity and mortality. These patients {{often have a}} significant limitation in their exercise capacity. We showed that there are widespread abnormalities of both systolic and diastolic function in HCM patients. These abnormalities contribute significantly to exercise limitation observed in these patients. Furthermore, we showed that HCM manifest a myocardial energy defieciency which {{was accompanied by a}} slowing of the energy-dependent early diastolic LV active relaxation during exercise. The present study supports the hypothesis that HCM is, at least in part, a disease of energy deficiency. Consistent with this hypothesis, we showed that metabolic modulation by perhexiline augmented myocardial energetics, and normalised diastolic ventricular filling which translated into significant subjective (improved symptoms) and objective (increased exercise capacity [peak VO 2]) clinical improvement in HCM patients. These findings suggest that metabolic modulators, such as perhexiline, have the potential role in the management of patients with symptomatic non obstructive HCM, a condition for which there are currently limited therapeutic options. However, large scale longterm studies are still required {{to examine the effects of}} these agents on <b>morbidty</b> and mortality in these patients.

40|$|Introduction: Today, {{breast cancer}} {{is one of the}} most common causes of {{mortality}} and <b>morbidty</b> and also the leading health concern of the world. Methods: This research was a descriptive study entitled; Knowledge, attitude and practice regarding prevention of breast cancer in working women of Chaloos city. The sample size of study included 612 women working in governmental centers. The instrument for data collection was a researcher –made questionnaire. For data analysis, central and coefficient index chi square,t-test,one way analysis of variation, Kruscal Wallis, Pearson,s correlation coefficient and Fisher test were used. Results: The findings showed that the most of samples were in the 30 - 39 years age group,(39. 7 %) with an educational job(83 / 5 %) and without history of breast cancer history in the family. (94 / 9 %) Results also revealed that there was a weak positive relationship between knowledge and attitude (r= 0. 33). The findings showed there was a significant statistical relation between knowledge and practice (p< 0. 05). Also, there was a significant statistical relation between knowledge level and breast self examination (BSE), time interval and also the time of performing BSE (p< 0. 0001) Similarly, the highest levels of knowledge were present in women with medical education and those with a bachelors or higher degree. The results showed that attitude scores were significantly different in various age, job and educational groups, (p< 0. 001, p< 0. 05,p< 0. 05) respectively Conclusion: The results showed that most of the population under study had a positive attitude but didn’t have good knowledge or practice...|$|E
40|$|The syncytiotrophoblast cell of {{the human}} {{placenta}} represents the interface between maternal and fetal blood supplies. This polarized epithelium consists of a maternal facing microvillous membrane (MVM) opposing a fetal facing basal membrane (BM). This unique syncytial cell is responsible for transfer of all nutrients to the developing fetus. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is an important cause of perinatal <b>morbidty</b> and mortality, and {{is associated with a}} tendency toward fetal acidosis and decreased fetal plasma amino acid levels. Distinct alterations of Na+ dependent amino acid transporters in the MVM have been described in IUGR. The electrochemical gradient for Na+ is maintained by the Na+/K+ ATPase and is the driving force for secondary active transporters such as Na+ coupled amino acid transport, Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) and Na+/Ca 2 + exchanger. Despite the importance of Na+/K+ ATPase for energizing placental transport, information on tissue distribution and activity is limited. The aims of this thesis were therefore to establish the localization and activity of placental Na+/K+ ATPase and to investigate whether Na+/K+ ATPase is reduced in IUGR pregnancies, possibly contributing to decreased nutrient transfer. To investigate whether the function of the major placental pH regulator, the NHE is impaired in IUGR pregnancies and to study the hormonal regulation of NHE in placental cells. Finally, we identified an additional pH regulating mechanism in the human placenta. 	Using immunohistochemistry, Western Blotting and activity measurements, the Na+/K+ ATPase was shown to be expressed in both the MVM and BM, with the majority of activity and expression localized to the MVM. NHE isoforms 1 - 3 were shown to be expressed predominantely in the MVM. The expression and activity of NHE- 1 were shown to be reduced by one third in preterm MVM isolated from IUGR pregnancies. In a simplified placental BeWo cell culture system, epidermal growth factor was shown to activate (one hour exposure) NHE, whereas insulin upregulated NHE- 1 expression following 18 hours incubation. Finally, the non-gastric H+/K+ ATPase was shown to be expressed on the RNA and protein level in the placental MVM and BM. The distribution of Na+/K+ ATPase to the MVM may represent a route of early Na+ reexport from the fetal to the maternal compartment to reduce the fetal sodium load from secondary active transport systems. The decreased activity and expression of Na+/K+ ATPase in MVM from pregnancies complicated by IUGR possibly contributes to the decreased nutrient transfer capacity associated with this condition. The decrease in NHE activity and expression may explain the acidosis tendency of IUGR fetuses, especially in conjunction with the reduced Na+/K+ ATPase activity. The connection between the reduced NHE activity in placental MVM and IUGR may be hormonal, since we provide evidence that EGF and Insulin, both of which are known to be decreased during IUGR, regulate NHE in placental BeWo cells. Finally, the demonstration of the non gastric H+/K+ ATPase in the syncytiotrophoblast indicates the presence of a new placental pH regulating mechanism in MVM and BM of human placent...|$|E
