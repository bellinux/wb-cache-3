40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a neuromorphic approach for sensor-based machine olfaction that combines a portable chemical detection {{system based on}} <b>microbead</b> array technology with a biologically inspired model of signal processing in the olfactory bulb. The sensor array contains hundreds of microbeads coated with solvatochromic dyes adsorbed in, or covalently attached on, the matrix of various microspheres. When exposed to odors, each bead sensor responds with corresponding intensity changes, spectral shifts, and time-dependent variations associated with the fluorescent sensors. The bead array responses are subsequently processed using a model of olfactory circuits that capture the following two functions: chemotopic convergence of receptor neurons and center on–off surround lateral interactions. The first circuit performs dimensionality reduction, transforming the high-dimensional <b>microbead</b> array response into an organized spatial pattern (i. e., an odor image).

Molecular studies and diagnostics also benefit from <b>microbeads</b> (e.g. immunoassay IVD and nucleic acid IVD). When <b>microbeads</b> are coupled with streptavidin, they offer a very efficient way to isolate any biotinylated molecule. This is frequently used in DNA/RNA binding protein studies, sequencing, and to prepare single stranded templates. Gene expression analysis also benefits from <b>microbeads,</b> such as isolating mRNA for transcriptional analysis.|$|R

New technology has allowed for <b>microbeads</b> to be loaded with pressure and/or temperature sensitive dyes. These <b>microbeads</b> can be seeded into flow fields {{in order to}} measure the pressure and/or temperature fields in the fluid flow. In addition, the <b>microbeads</b> act as tracer particles to the fluid velocity and therefore, standard PIV techniques can be applied to quantify the velocity of the flow simultaneously with the pressure and/or temperature measurement. Existing studies have investigated the use of polystyrene <b>microbeads</b> for simultaneous flow barometry and velocimetry yet the polystyrene <b>microbeads</b> have a slow response time to changing pressures, making them incapable of resolving accurate pressures in fast flow applications such as wind tunnels. In this contribution, silicon dioxide and oxide-based multi-dye <b>microbeads</b> were characterized and found to have much faster response times than polystyrene-based <b>microbeads.</b> The pressure response times and sensitivity of these <b>microbeads</b> were tested to determine the most viable candidate for future unsteady applications. It will also be shown that the intensity-based approach applied to these <b>microbeads</b> coated on a glass slide can be used to accurately measure pressure with a significantly high measure of precision and low pressure uncertainties down to 106 Pa. Finally, this paper will demonstrate the feasibility of using aerosolized pressure-sensitive <b>microbeads</b> for simultaneous barometry and velocimetry for fluid dynamic applications...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} project was to develop polymer microbead-based Raman/surface {{enhanced}} Raman scattering (SERS) immunoassay systems for the multiplex, specific and sensitive detection of biological molecules. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) was used as model proteins. In the system, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) serve as SERS-active substrates. Different Raman-active molecules, such as 4 -mercaptobenzoic acid (4 MBA), can be easily self-assembled on the AuNPs as SERS tags. Polymer <b>microbeads</b> offer as immune-solid supports and provide Raman signatures. This study focused on the fabrication of different SERS tags, SERS-active <b>microbeads</b> and Raman spectroscopic-encoded <b>microbeads</b> for microbead-based Raman/SERS immunoassay development. Polymer microbead-based Raman/SERS immunoassay system was first developed using 50 nm AuNPs and 130 - 600 μm carboxylated polystyrene (PS) <b>microbeads</b> synthesised by suspension polymerisation. Antibodies (FITC-labelled donkey anti-goat IgG) were conjugated to polymer <b>microbeads</b> by EDC/NHS coupling chemistry. The SERS tags were comprised of Raman-active molecules (4 MBA) and AuNPs. Antigens (DyLight™ 649 - labelled goat anti-human IgG) were successfully conjugated on SERS tags to form SERS reporters. The immunoassay was performed by mixing the protein conjugated polymer <b>microbeads</b> and SERS reporters together. Due to the specific recognition between antibody and antigen, AuNPs can be attached {{on the surface of}} polymer <b>microbeads.</b> The results were verified using fluorescence imaging and Raman/SERS analysis. Since flow cytometry can rapidly sort large number of cells and particles in a short time, our intention was to take the advantages of both flow cytometry and Raman effects to develop Raman flow cytometry for multiplex and rapid detection. Therefore, monodisperse polymer <b>microbeads</b> with unique Raman signatures need to be synthesised. The preparation of the monodisperse polymer <b>microbeads</b> with specific Raman signatures was carried out by two approaches. Firstly, the SERS-active <b>microbeads</b> were synthesised by the deposition of AuNPs on the surface of polymer <b>microbeads</b> and the addition of the Raman-active molecules prior to silica coating. The preparation of polystyrene microbead/AuNP composite microspheres was achieved through two methods (direct adsorption and in-situ growth). The mechanism for the silica coating of polystyrene/AuNP composite microspheres was discussed in details. 4 -mercaptophenol (4 MP) was self-assembled on the composite microspheres, followed by silica coating to obtain the SERS-active <b>microbeads.</b> Secondly, the Raman spectroscopic-encoded copolymer <b>microbeads</b> were fabricated using styrene (Sty), 4 -tertbutylstyrene (4 tBS), and 4 -methylstyrene (4 MS) by dispersion polymerisation. Acrylic acid (AA) was used as the co-monomer to generate carboxyl groups on the surface of polymer <b>microbeads.</b> Six kinds of copolymer <b>microbeads</b> with the average diameters between 1. 07 and 1. 69 μm, including poly(Sty-AA), poly(Sty- 4 tBS-AA), poly(4 tBS-AA), poly(Sty- 4 MS-AA), poly(4 MS-AA), and poly(4 tBS- 4 MS-AA), were synthesised with narrow size distribution and unique Raman fingerprints, which could be employed as spectroscopic-encoded <b>microbeads</b> in microbead-based Raman/SERS immunoassay system. Monodisperse polystyrene <b>microbeads</b> with 1. 6 μm diameter were also used to perform the polymer microbead-based Raman/SERS immunoassays. A similar immunoassay system as previous was applied for IgG recognition based on AuNPs and monodisperse PS <b>microbeads,</b> which were sorted and analysed using flow cytometry and Raman equipment. In summary, the thesis proposed a new strategy for multiplex detection and reported the preliminary studies on polymer microbead-based Raman/SERS immunoassay. Different SERS-active <b>microbeads</b> and Raman spectroscopic-encoded copolymer <b>microbeads</b> have been successfully synthesised. Thesis (Ph. D.)
