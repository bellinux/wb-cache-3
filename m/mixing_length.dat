This model is used to identify key design parameters involved in fuel-air mixing and to characterize how mixing performance scales with the Reynolds number. The results of this analysis show that fuel-air mixing in micro-flameholders occurs primarily at low Reynolds numbers (1 <Re< 5 x 103) traditionally associated with the laminar to transitional flow regime. <b>Mixing</b> <b>lengths</b> in micro-flameholders based solely on molecular diffusion are also predicted using a modified Burke-Schumann model. The predicted <b>mixing</b> <b>lengths</b> indicate that less distance is required for fuel-air mixing as micro-flameholders get smaller. Axisymmetric CFD simulations are performed to validate the predictions of the Burke-Schumann model, and to investigate the importance of axial diffusion and viscous effects.

Assuming uniform length interconnects, existing work has developed time slack budgeting to minimize power based on estimating the lower bound of power reduction using dual-Vdd for given time slack. In this paper, {{we show that}} such lower bound estimation cannot be extended to <b>mixed</b> <b>length</b> interconnects {{that are used in}} modern FPGAs. We develop a technique to estimate power reduction using dual-Vdd for <b>mixed</b> <b>length</b> interconnects, and apply linear programming (LP) to solve slack budgeting to minimize power for <b>mixed</b> <b>length</b> interconnects. Experiments show 53 % power reduction on average compared to single-Vdd interconnects. Furthermore, this paper presents a simultaneous retiming and slack budgeting algorithm to reduce power in dual-Vdd FPGAs considering placement and flip-flop binding constraints. The algorithm is based on mixed integer and linear programming (MILP) and achieves up to 20 % power reduction compared to retiming followed by slack budgeting. We propose a runtime efficient flow to apply simultaneous retiming and slack budgeting only when it is necessary. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first in-depth study of simultaneous retiming and slack budgeting for dual-Vdd programmable FPGA power reduction while considering layout constraints...|$|R

40|$|A multiwavenumber {{theory is}} {{formulated}} to represent eddy diffusivities. It expands on earlier single-wavenumber theories and includes {{the wide range}} of wavenumbers encompassed in eddy motions. In the limiting case in which ocean eddies are only composed of a single wavenumber, the multiwavenumber theory is equivalent to the single-wavenumber theory and both show mixing suppression by the eddy propagation relative to the mean flow. The multiwavenumber theory was tested in a region of the Southern Ocean (70 °– 45 °S, 110 °– 20 °W) that covers the Drake Passage and includes the tracer/float release locations during the Diapycnal and Isopycnal Mixing Experiment in the Southern Ocean (DIMES). Cross-stream eddy diffusivities and <b>mixing</b> <b>lengths</b> were estimated in this region from the single-wavenumber theory, from the multiwavenumber theory, and from floats deployed in a global k[subscript 0]° Parallel Ocean Program (POP) simulation. Compared to the single-wavenumber theory, the horizontal structures of cross-stream <b>mixing</b> <b>lengths</b> from the multiwavenumber theory agree better with the simulated float-based estimates at almost all depth levels. The multiwavenumber theory better represents the vertical structure of cross-stream <b>mixing</b> <b>lengths</b> {{both inside and outside the}} Antarctica Circumpolar Current (ACC).

40|$|<b>Mixing</b> {{dependency}} <b>lengths</b> from {{sequences of}} different length {{is a common}} practice in language research. However, the empirical distribution of dependency lengths of sentences of the same length {{differs from that of}} sentences of varying length and the distribution of dependency lengths depends on sentence length for real sentences and also under the null hypothesis that dependencies connect vertices located in random positions of the sequence. This suggests that certain results, such as the distribution of syntactic dependency <b>lengths</b> <b>mixing</b> dependencies from sentences of varying length, could be a mere consequence of that mixing. Furthermore, differences in the global averages of dependency <b>length</b> (<b>mixing</b> <b>lengths</b> from sentences of varying length) for two different languages do not simply imply a priori that one language optimizes dependency lengths better than the other because those differences could be due to differences in the distribution of sentence lengths and other factors.
