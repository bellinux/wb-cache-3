25|$|Baudrillard is not disputing the trivial {{issue that}} reason remains {{operative}} in some actions, that if I want {{to arrive at}} the next block, for example, I can assume a Newtonian universe (common sense), plan a course of action (to walk straight for Xmeters), carry out the action, and finally fulfill <b>my</b> <b>goal</b> by arriving at the point in question. What is in doubt is that this sort of thinking enables a historically informed grasp of the present in general. According to Baudrillard, it does not. The concurrent spread of the hyperreal through the media and the collapse of liberal and Marxist politics as the master narratives, deprives the rational subject of its privileged access to truth. In an important sense individuals are no longer citizens, eager to maximise their civil rights, nor proletarians, anticipating the onset of communism. They are rather consumers, and hence the prey of objects as defined by the code.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Little {{is known}} about use of goal setting and {{tracking}} tools within online programs to support nutrition and physical activity behaviour change. In 2011, Dietitians of Canada added “My Goals,” a nutrition and physical activity behaviour goal setting and tracking tool to their free publicly available self-monitoring website (eaTracker® ([URL])). <b>My</b> <b>Goals</b> allows users to: a) set “ready-made” SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-related) goals (choice of n[*]=[*] 87 goals from n[*]=[*] 13 categories) or “write your own” goals, and b) track progress using the “My Goals Tracker. ” The {{purpose of this study}} was to characterize: a) <b>My</b> <b>Goals</b> user demographics, b) types of goals set, and c) <b>My</b> <b>Goals</b> Tracker use. Methods Anonymous data on all goals set using the <b>My</b> <b>Goals</b> feature from December 6 / 2012 -April 28 / 2014 by users ≥ 19 y from Ontario and Alberta, Canada were obtained. This dataset contained: anonymous self-reported user demographic data, user set <b>goals,</b> and <b>My</b> <b>Goals</b> Tracker use data. Write your own goals were categorized by topic and specificity. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Multivariate binary logistic regression was used to determine associations between user demographics and a) goal topic areas and b) <b>My</b> <b>Goals</b> Tracker use. Results Overall, n[*]=[*] 16, 511 goal statements (75. 4 % ready-made; 24. 6 % write your own) set by n[*]=[*] 8, 067 adult users 19 - 85 y (83. 3 % female; mean age 41. 1 [*]±[*] 15. 0 y, mean BMI 28. 8 [*]±[*] 7. 6 kg/m 2) were included for analysis. Overall, 33. 1 % of ready-made goals were from the “Managing your Weight” category. Of write your own goal entries, 42. 3 % were solely distal goals (most related to weight management); 38. 6 % addressed nutrition behaviour change (16. 6 % had unspecific general eating goals); 18. 1 % addressed physical activity behaviour change (47. 3 % had goals without information on exercise amount and type). Many write your own goals were poor quality (e. g., non-specific (e. g., missing amounts)), and possibly unrealistic (e. g., no sugar). Few goals were tracked (< 10 %). Demographic variables had statistically significant relations with goal topic areas and <b>My</b> <b>Goals</b> Tracker use. Conclusions eaTracker® users had high interest in goal setting and the <b>My</b> <b>Goals</b> feature, however, self-written goals were often poor quality and goal tracking was rare. Further research is needed to better support users...|$|R

500|$|Naming the {{characters}} after {{members of his}} own family, Homer was named after Groening's father Homer Groening, who himself had been named after ancient Greek poet Homer. Very little else of Homer's character was based on him, and to prove that the meaning behind Homer's name was not significant, Groening later named his own son Homer. According to Groening, [...] "Homer originated with <b>my</b> <b>goal</b> to both amuse my real father, and just annoy him a little bit. My father was an athletic, creative, intelligent filmmaker and writer, and the only thing he had in common with Homer was a love of donuts."

500|$|Before the album's release, in December 2012, Cudi {{dedicated}} Indicud to {{the late}} Ben Breedlove and all his fans who died, continuing: [...] "My journey shall continue in your honor. Never forgotten." [...] The dedication was ultimately included in the album's liner notes. The album is upbeat and optimistic, very much unlike his previous studio album [...] (2010), which was considered darkly erratic. The positive vibe stems from Cudi's desire to always change and reinvent: [...] "I always try to push myself {{to the next level}} with everything I do. Since I've been in the business, critics have known that about me. When I started working on Indicud, I just wanted to bring more energy into my sound. Most of my old music was driven towards relaxed, chilled out smoke music. And that was <b>my</b> <b>goal</b> first coming in. Now it's like, 'What’s a side of me that people haven’t seen?' The only time people have seen me on up-tempos is on remixes or some shit. So I just wanted to take the energy to the next level. That ultimately inspired the subject matter. It was a chain reaction.
