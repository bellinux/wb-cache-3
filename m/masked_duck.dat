40|$|This bizarre {{group of}} diving ducks {{differs from the}} rest of the Anatidae in so many respects that by any {{standard}} it demands special attention. Of the eight species that are presently recognized, most are placed in the genus Oxyura, which name refers to the stiffened, elongated tail feathers typical of the group. In these species the tail feathers extend well beyond the rather short tail coverts and are usually narrow-vaned, so that the individual rectrices tend to separate when spread. The feet are unusually large, and the legs are placed farther to the rear of the body than in any other waterfowl tribe, increasing propulsion efficiency during diving but rendering the birds nearly helpless on land. This grebe-like adaptation is paralleled by the evolution of numerous short, glossy body feathers, presumably increasing the effectiveness of waterproofing. In the typical stiff-tails the bill is rather short, broad, and distinctly flattened toward the tip, and virtually all the foraging is done under water. At least in the North American species of stiff-tails, most of the food taken is of vegetable origin. Nests of the typical stiff-tails are built above water, of reed mats or similar vegetation, and often a ramp leads from the nest cup to the water, providing easy access. The birds are quite heavy-bodied and have relatively short wings, so that flight is attained with some difficulty in most species. The <b>masked</b> <b>duck</b> is something of an exception to this point, since its combination of small body size and fairly long wings allows it to land and take off with surprising agility from water of moderate depth. Only two species of stiff-tails have ever been reported from North America, and it is most unlikely that any others will ever occur here by natural means. The ruddy duck is much the more widespread and abundant of these, while the little-known <b>masked</b> <b>duck</b> barely reaches the Mexico-United States border as a breeding species. Indeed, the <b>masked</b> <b>duck</b> is the species most recently added to the list of known breeding North American waterfowl, since it was not until 1967 that firm evidence of its breeding in Texas was established...|$|E

40|$|Black-headed Duck <b>Masked</b> <b>Duck</b> Ruddy Duck White-headed Duck Maccoa Duck Argentine Blue-billed Duck Australian Blue-billed Duck Musk Duck The stiff-tailed ducks are {{characterized}} by several unusual features {{in addition to their}} long, stiffened tail feathers that serve as underwater rudders. Among other adaptations are their very large feet, which are placed so far back on the body that it is difficult for these birds to walk on land. The body feathers are small, numerous, and have a grebe-like sheen, and the wings are so short that takeoff and flight is attained with difficulty. All of the species have relatively short and thick necks, which in males can be enlarged by the inflation of various internal structures during sexual display. Although all of the species exhibit some dimorphism of size or coloration, the plumage patterns are mostly shades of gray, ruddy brown, and black, with contrasting white markings largely limited to the head. Only one species, the <b>masked</b> <b>duck,</b> exhibits a distinct speculum, and this species is furthermore the only one that is able to attain flight easily. The downy plumage patterns are usually very {{similar to those of the}} adult females, which tend to be inconspicuously patterned with grays and browns. Nonbreeding plumages of males also closely resemble those of the females, and during this period the ruddy coloration of the typical forms is largely lost, as is the unusual blue color of the male 2 ̆ 7 s bill. Two species that do not fit this general pattern are the Australian musk duck and the South American black-headed duck. The musk duck may readily be considered a typical stiff tail that, under evolutionary pressures associated with a highly competitive mating system favoring strength and aggressiveness, has become remarkably large and has evolved bizarre male displays. However, the black-headed duck lacks many of the traits of the stiff-tailed ducks, and in many anatomical features more closely approaches the dabbling ducks. In addition to providing an apparent evolutionary link with that group, the black-headed duck is also the only species of Anatidae that seems to have become a total social parasite, abandoning its nest-building tendencies in favor of dropping its eggs in the nests of a variety of host species. In this sense it is one of the most specialized of all waterfowl species, although its parasitic adaptations are relatively primitive by comparison with those of some of the better-known species of social parasites...|$|E
40|$|The {{species of}} {{waterfowl}} breeding in North America have distribution patterns that collectively reflect the past geologic and ecological histories of this continent. In general, our waterfowl species {{may be grouped}} into those that are limited (endemic) to North America, those that are shared between North and South America, {{and those that are}} shared with Europe and/or Asia. Of the forty-four species known to breed in continental North America, the resulting grouping of breeding distributions is as follows: Limited to North America: Snow goose (also on Greenland and Wrangel Island), Ross goose, Canada goose (also on Greenland), wood duck, American wigeon, black duck, blue-winged teal, redhead, canvasback, ringnecked duck, lesser scaup, Labrador duck (extinct), surf scoter, bufflehead, hooded merganser. Shared with Eurasia: Trumpeter swan (whooper swan), whistling swan (Bewick swan), white-fronted goose, brant goose, gadwall, green-winged teal, mallard, pintail, shoveler, greater scaup, common eider, king eider, harlequin duck, oldsquaw, black scoter, white-winged scoter, common goldeneye, red-breasted merganser, common merganser. Shared with South America: Fulvous whistling duck, black-bellied whistling duck, muscovy duck, cinnamon teal, <b>masked</b> <b>duck,</b> ruddy duck. Shared with Asia only: Emperor goose, spectacled eider, Steller eider (rarely to Norway). Shared with Europe only: Barrow goldeneye (Iceland and Greenland). Native to Eurasia, introduced into North America: Mute swan. It is thus clear that the strongest zoogeographic affinities of our waterfowl are with Europe and Asia, since twenty-three out of the forty-four native North American species have. populations shared with one or both of these areas. Only six species are shared with South America, and, of these, the fulvous whistling duck has a more general tropical distribution that includes Africa and southern Asia. Consequently, it would appear that South America has played only a minor role in providing waterfowl stock for North America, and vice versa. Certainly the great number of waterfowl species shared between the North American and Eurasian landmasses can be largely attributed to Pleistocene and post-Pleistocene history. Ploeger (1968) analyzed the distributions of eighteen species of arctic-breeding Anatidae and concluded that both their present distributions and their described geographic variations could be at· tributed to the physical-geographical situation existing in the Northern Hemisphere during Late Glacial times. Only a minority (38 percent) of these species exhibit noticeable geographic variation, and most of the eighteen have breeding ranges that include both North America and Eurasia. The exceptions are three Eurasian geese (red-breasted, bean, and lesser white-fronted geese), three North American geese (Canada, Ross, and snow geese), and the North Atlantic barnacle goose. It is of interest that these are all geese, a group noted for their strongly traditional wintering and breeding grounds, as opposed to the less tradition-bound ducks...|$|E
