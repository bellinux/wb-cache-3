5|$|The {{melting point}} of iron is {{experimentally}} well defined for pressures less than 50GPa. For greater pressures, studies put the γ-ε-liquid triple point at pressures that differ by tens of gigapascals and 1000K in the melting point. Generally speaking, molecular dynamics computer simulations of iron melting and shock wave experiments suggest higher melting points {{and a much}} steeper slope of the <b>melting</b> <b>curve</b> than static experiments carried out in diamond anvil cells. The melting and boiling points of iron, along with its enthalpy of atomization, are {{lower than those of}} the earlier 3d elements from scandium to chromium, showing the lessened contribution of the 3d electrons to metallic bonding as they are attracted more and more into the inert core by the nucleus; however, they are higher than the values for the previous element manganese because that element has a half-filled 3d subshell and consequently its d-electrons are not easily delocalized. This same trend appears for ruthenium but not osmium.|$|E

2500|$|An {{important}} {{property of}} helium-3, which distinguishes {{it from the}} more common helium-4, is that its nucleus is a fermion since it contains an odd number of spin [...] particles. Helium-4 nuclei are bosons, containing an even number of spin [...] particles. This {{is a direct result}} of the addition rules for quantized angular momentum. At low temperatures (about 2.17 K), helium-4 undergoes a phase transition: A fraction of it enters a superfluid phase that can be roughly understood as a type of Bose–Einstein condensate. Such a mechanism is not available for helium-3 atoms, which are fermions. However, it was widely speculated that helium-3 could also become a superfluid at much lower temperatures, if the atoms formed into pairs analogous to Cooper pairs in the BCS theory of superconductivity. Each Cooper pair, having integer spin, can be thought of as a boson.

40|$|Abstract. - Standard DNA <b>melting</b> <b>curves</b> {{record the}} {{separation}} of the two strands versus temperature, but they do not provide any information on the location of the opening. We introduce an experimental method which adds a new dimension to the <b>melting</b> <b>curves</b> of short DNA sequences by allowing us to record the degree of opening in several positions along the molecule all at once. This adds the spatial dimension to the <b>melting</b> <b>curves</b> and allows a precise investigation {{of the role of the}} base-pair sequence on the fluctuations and denaturation of the DNA double helix. We illustrate the power of the method by investigating the influence of an AT rich region on the fluctuations of neighboring domains. DNA melting, i. e. {{the separation of}} the two strands of the double helix, and its reverse process hybridisation are ubiquitous in biology, in vivo for instance for DNA transcription in the reading of the genetic code of a gene, as well as in vitro in biological laboratories for PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) or the use of DNA microarrays. This is why DNA melting has been extensively studied even in the early days of DNA structural studies [1].

40|$|Summary. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) viral {{load and}} its {{genotype}} play {{important roles in}} clinical outcome, management of disease and response to antiviral therapy. In {{many parts of the}} world such as Europe or the Middle East, distinguishing HBV genotype D from non-D is most relevant for treatment decisions, because genotype D-infected patients respond poorly to interferon-based therapeutic regimens. Here, we developed an in-house real-time PCR to concordantly assess HBV genotype (D vs non-D) based on <b>melt</b> <b>curve</b> analysis and quantify the viral load. Genotype distinction was established with control plasmids of all HBV genotypes and validated with 57 clinical samples from patients infected with six different HBV genotypes. Our in-house real-time PCR assay could discriminate HBV genotype D from non-D using single-step <b>melt</b> <b>curve</b> analysis with a 2 degrees C difference in the <b>melt</b> <b>curve</b> temperature in all samples tested. Viral load quantification was calibrated with the WHO HBV international standard, demonstrating an excellent correlation with a commercial kit (r = 0. 852; P < 0. 0001) in a linear range from 3. 2 x 10 (2) to 3. 2 x 10 (10) IU/mL. In conclusion, we developed a rapid, simple and cost-effective method to simultaneously quantify and distinguish HBV genotypes D from non-D with a single-step PCR run and <b>melt</b> <b>curve</b> analysis. This assay should be a useful diagnostic alternative to aid clinical decisions about initiation and choice of antiviral therapy, especially in geographical regions with a high prevalence of HBV genotype D. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Real-time or {{quantitative}} PCR (qPCR) is {{an innovative}} method {{used to determine}} the amount of amplifiable DNA in a biological sample. Typically, a fluorescent dye is introduced during thermal cycling, causing a change in fluorescent output as the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) product accumulates.
