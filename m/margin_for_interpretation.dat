6000|$|By {{this time}} I had got a certain start with [...] "Rutland Ramsay," [...] the first novel {{in the great}} {{projected}} series; that is I had produced a dozen drawings, several {{with the help of}} the Major and his wife, and I had sent them in for approval. My understanding with the publishers as I have already hinted, had been that I was to be left to do my work, in this particular case, as I liked, with the whole book committed to me; but my connexion with the rest of the series was only contingent. There were moments when, frankly, it WAS a comfort to have the real thing under one's hand for there were characters in [...] "Rutland Ramsay" [...] that were very much like it. There were people presumably as erect as the Major and women of as good a fashion as Mrs. Monarch. There was a great deal of country-house life-treated, it is true, in a fine fanciful ironical generalised way--and there was a considerable implication of knickerbockers and kilts. There were certain things I had to settle at the outset; such things for instance as the exact appearance of the hero and the particular bloom and figure of the heroine. The author of course gave me a lead, but there was a <b>margin</b> <b>for</b> <b>interpretation.</b> I took the Monarchs into my confidence, I told them frankly what I was about, I mentioned my embarrassments and alternatives. [...] "Oh take HIM!" [...] Mrs. Monarch murmured sweetly, looking at her husband; and [...] "What could you want better than my wife?" [...] the Major inquired with the comfortable candour that now prevailed between us.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSafety {{regulations}} and standards imposed by national regulators on {{nuclear power plant}} systems provide high-level requirements, recommendations and/or guidance expressed in natural language. In many cases, this leaves a large <b>margin</b> <b>for</b> <b>interpretation,</b> not {{all of which are}} acceptable to a given regulator. Currently the elements that lead to the establishment of acceptable/accepted practices are not always documented, nor are these practices formally modeled. When a new standard appears or when Electricité de France (EDF) has to discuss a standard with another regulator, there is no systematic process to build a practice. Domain-specific modeling, traceability and variability modeling are Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) techniques that could address various aspects of practice formalization. This paper precisely defines the modeling issues that are currently faced by EDF when managing regulatory safety requirements, standards and practices. Then we review existing requirements modeling techniques to understand their benefits and limits according to EDF's needs...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNuclear {{power plants}} {{are some of}} the most {{sophisticated}} and complex energy systems ever designed. These systems perform safety critical functions and must conform to national safety institutions and international regulations. In many cases, regulatory documents provide very high level and ambiguous requirements that leave a large <b>margin</b> <b>for</b> <b>interpretation.</b> As the French nuclear industry is now seeking to spread its activities outside France, it is but necessary to master the ins and the outs of the variability between countries safety culture and regulations. This sets both an industrial and a scientiﬁc challenge to introduce and propose a product line engineering approach to an unaware industry whose safety culture is made of interpretations, speciﬁcities, and exceptions. This paper presents our current work within the French R&D project CONNEXION, while introducing variability modeling to the French nuclear industry. In particular, we discuss the background, the quest for the best variability paradigm, the practical modeling of requirements variability as well as the mapping between variable requirements and variable architecture elements...|$|E
40|$|Forms are our {{gates to}} the web. They {{enable us to}} access the deep content of web sites. Automatic form {{understanding}} unlocks this content for applications ranging from crawlers to meta-search engines and is essential for improving usability and accessibility of the web. Form understanding has received surprisingly little attention other than as component in specific applications such as crawlers. No comprehensive approach to form understanding exists and previous works disagree even {{in the definition of}} the problem. In this paper, we present OPAL, the first comprehensive approach to form understanding. We identify form labeling and form interpretation as the two main tasks involved in form understanding. On both problems OPAL pushes the state of the art: For form labeling, it combines signals from the text, structure, and visual rendering of a web page, yielding robust characterisations of common design patterns. In extensive experiments on the ICQ and TEL- 8 benchmarks and a set of 200 modern web forms OPAL outperforms previous approaches by a significant <b>margin.</b> <b>For</b> form <b>interpretation,</b> we introduce a template language to describe frequent form patterns. These two parts of OPAL combined yield form understanding with near perfect accuracy (> 98 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Forms are our {{gates to}} the web. They {{enable us to}} access the deep content of web sites. Automatic form {{understanding}} provides applications, ranging from crawlers over meta-search engines to service integrators, with a key to this content. Yet, it has received little attention other than as component in specific applications such as crawlers or meta-search engines. No comprehensive approach to form understanding exists, let alone one that produces rich models for semantic services or integration with linked open data. In this paper, we present OPAL, the first comprehensive approach to form understanding and integration. We identify form labeling and form interpretation as the two main tasks involved in form understanding. On both problems OPAL pushes {{the state of the}} art: For form labeling, it combines features from the text, structure, and visual rendering of a web page. In extensive experiments on the ICQ and TEL- 8 benchmarks and a set of 200 modern web forms OPAL out-performs previous approaches for form labeling by a signif-icant <b>margin.</b> <b>For</b> form <b>interpretation,</b> OPAL uses a schema (or ontology) of forms in a given domain. Thanks to this do-main schema, it is able to produce nearly perfect (> 97 % ac-curacy in the evaluation domains) form interpretations. Yet, the effort to produce a domain schema is very low, as we pro-vide a Datalog-based template language that eases the spec-ification of such schemata and a methodology for deriving a domain schema largely automatically from an existing do-main ontology. We demonstrate the value of OPAL’s form in-terpretations through a light-weight form integration system that successfully translates and distributes master queries to hundreds of forms with no error, yet is implemented with only a handful translation rules...|$|R
40|$|The {{southern}} Tyrrhenian Sea margin {{is dominated}} by deformations whose kinematics are relatively poorly constrained, and different models have been proposed to account for its recent evolution. Analysis of new structural and space geodesy data, combined with available geophysical information, reveal a deformation field characterised by subhorizontal NW-SE directed shortening and SW-NE directed extension. The main recognised regional-scale structure comprises E-W trending fault zones, namely the Ustica-Eolie Line and the Mt. Kumeta-Alcantara Line, connected by the NW-SE trending Marettimo, Trapani, San Vito, Palermo, Gratteri-Mt. Mufara and Eolie faults. This fault network displays a remarkable dextral strike-slip character, and has the features of a strike-slip duplex, that we indicate as the Southern Tyrrhenian Strike-Slip Duplex (STSSD). Analysis of available geophysical data and regional considerations based on platetectonic reconstructions suggest that the STSSD is a primary feature of lithospheric-scale importance. Our strike-slip duplex model differs significantly from previously proposed passive <b>margin</b> <b>interpretations</b> <b>for</b> the Tyrrhenian Sea margin offshore northern Sicily. The results of this investigation show the effectiveness of an integrated, multidisciplinary approach {{in the study of}} active deformation margin...|$|R

It was observed that total marketing <b>margins</b> <b>for</b> potato was 38. 86 %, for peas 54. 89 % and for marrow 62. 89 %. The net <b>margins</b> <b>for</b> potato, peas and marrow were 19. 04, 27. 25 and 30. 50 %, respectively. The producer received 61. 136, 45. 106 and 37. 107 % of the price paid by the consumer for potato, peas and marrow, respectively. The difference in marketing <b>margins</b> <b>for</b> various vegetables is due to high marketing and picking costs. It was observed that 30 % of the potato fields were sold to pre harvest contractors. The highest marketing <b>margins</b> were observed <b>for</b> marrow followed by peas and potato, respectively. The highest net <b>margins</b> <b>for</b> producers were observed for potato followed by peas and marrow.
