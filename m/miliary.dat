25|$|WHO BCG policy: The WHO {{recommend}} BCG {{be given}} to all children born in countries highly endemic for TB because it protects against <b>miliary</b> TB and TB meningitis.|$|E
25|$|BCG {{seems to}} have its {{greatest}} effect in preventing <b>miliary</b> TB or TB meningitis, so it is still extensively used even in countries where efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis is negligible.|$|E
25|$|Steroids may be {{of benefit}} in peritonitis, <b>miliary</b> disease, {{tubercular}} osteomyelitis, TB osteomyelitis, laryngeal TB, lymphadenitis and genitourinary disease, but the evidence is scant and the routine use of steroids cannot be recommended. Steroid treatment in these patients should be considered {{on a case by}} case basis by the attending physician.|$|E
25|$|According to the Ohio Department of Health and US Department of Health, the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine {{does not}} protect against TB infection. It does, though, give 80% of {{children}} protection against tuberculous meningitis and <b>miliary</b> tuberculosis. Therefore, a positive TST/PPD {{in a person}} who has received BCG vaccine is interpreted as latent TB infection (LTBI).|$|E

The {{official}} record has it as hitziges Frieselfieber ("severe <b>miliary</b> fever", {{referring to a}} rash that looks like millet seeds), more {{a description of the}} symptoms than a diagnosis. Researchers have posited at least 118 causes of death, including acute rheumatic fever, streptococcal infection, trichinosis, influenza, mercury poisoning, and a rare kidney ailment.|$|E

500|$|If TB {{bacteria}} gain {{entry to}} the blood stream from an area of damaged tissue, they can spread throughout the body and set up many foci of infection, all appearing as tiny, white tubercles in the tissues. [...] This severe form of TB disease, most common in young children and those with HIV, is called <b>miliary</b> tuberculosis. [...] People with this disseminated TB have a high fatality rate even with treatment (about 30%).|$|E
500|$|Whitman died on March 26, 1892. An autopsy {{revealed}} his lungs had diminished to one-eighth their normal breathing capacity, {{a result of}} bronchial pneumonia, and that an egg-sized abscess on his chest had eroded one of his ribs. The {{cause of death was}} officially listed as [...] "pleurisy of the left side, consumption of the right lung, general <b>miliary</b> tuberculosis and parenchymatous nephritis." [...] A public viewing of his body was held at his Camden home; over 1,000 people visited in three hours. Whitman's oak coffin was barely visible because of all the flowers and wreaths left for him. Four days after his death, he was buried in his tomb at Harleigh Cemetery in Camden. Another public ceremony was held at the cemetery, with friends giving speeches, live music, and refreshments. Whitman's friend, the orator Robert Ingersoll, delivered the eulogy. Later, the remains of Whitman's parents and two of his brothers and their families were moved to the mausoleum.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the parish}} register, the entry {{concerning}} Mozart's death states {{he died of}} [...] "severe <b>miliary</b> fever"; – [...] "miliary" [...] referring to the appearance of millet-sized bumps on the skin. This does not name the actual disease.|$|E
2500|$|In active {{pulmonary}} TB, infiltrates or consolidations and/or cavities {{are often}} seen in the upper lungs with or without mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy or pleural effusions ( [...] tuberculous pleurisy). However, lesions may appear anywhere in the lungs. In disseminated TB a pattern of many tiny nodules throughout the lung fields is common - the so-called <b>miliary</b> TB. In HIV and other immunosuppressed persons, any abnormality may indicate TB or the chest X-ray may even appear entirely normal.|$|E
2500|$|Air {{travel and}} the other methods of travel which have made global {{interaction}} easier, have increased the spread of TB across different societies. Luckily, the BCG vaccine was developed, which prevents TB meningitis and <b>miliary</b> TB in childhood. [...] But, the vaccine does not provide substantial protection against the more virulent forms of TB found among adults. Most forms of TB can be treated with antibiotics to kill the bacteria. The two antibiotics most commonly used are rifampicin and isoniazid. [...] There are dangers, however, of a rise of antibiotic-resistant TB. [...] The TB treatment regimen is lengthy, and difficult for poor and disorganized people to complete, increasing resistance of bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant TB {{is also known as}} [...] "multidrug-resistant tuberculosis." [...] "Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis" [...] is a pandemic that is on the rise. Patients with MDR-TB are mostly young adults who are not infected with HIV or have other existing illness. Due to the lack of health care infrastructure in underdeveloped countries, there is a debate as to whether treating MDR-TB will be cost effective or not. The reason is the high cost of [...] "second-line" [...] antituberculosis medications. It has been argued that the reason the cost of treating patients with MDR-TB is high is because there has been a shift in focus in the medical field, in particular the rise of AIDS, which is now the world's leading infectious cause of death. Nonetheless, it is still important to put in the effort to help and treat patients with [...] "multidrug-resistant tuberculosis" [...] in poor countries.|$|E

"My answer, gentlemen," [...] he said, [...] "will be a {{very brief}} one as brief, indeed, as the {{prosecution}} merits--for I entertain the hope that no member of this court is satisfied that the case made out against me is by any means complete." [...] He spoke easily, fluently, and calmly: a man supremely self-controlled. [...] "It amounts, indeed, to throwing upon me the onus of proving myself innocent, {{and that is a}} burden which no British laws, civil or <b>miliary,</b> would ever commit the injustice of imposing upon an accused.|$|E

50|$|In {{veterinary}} medicine, <b>miliary</b> dermatitis is a multifocal {{distribution of}} skin lesions, with no identifiable pattern. The term <b>miliary</b> means millet-like, as the papules on the coat of an affected cat feel similar to millet seeds.|$|E
50|$|Patients with <b>miliary</b> {{tuberculosis}} often experience non-specific signs, such as {{coughing and}} enlarged lymph nodes. <b>Miliary</b> tuberculosis can also present with enlarged liver (40% of cases), enlarged spleen (15%), {{inflammation of the}} pancreas (<5%), and multiple organ dysfunction with adrenal insufficiency (adrenal glands do not produce enough steroid hormones to regulate organ function). <b>Miliary</b> tuberculosis may also present with unilateral or bilateral pneumothorax rarely. Stool may also be diarrheal in nature and appearance.|$|E
50|$|Lastly, between 10 and 30% of adults, and 20-40% of {{children}} with <b>miliary</b> tuberculosis have tuberculosis meningitis. This relationship results from myobacteria from <b>miliary</b> tuberculosis spreading to the brain and the subarachnoid space; as a result, leading to tuberculosis meningitis.|$|E
5000|$|When {{it spreads}} to the bones, {{it is known}} as [...] "osseous tuberculosis", a form of osteomyelitis.

50|$|Thirdly, chorodial tubercules, pale lesions on {{the optic}} nerve, {{typically}} indicate <b>miliary</b> tuberculosis in children. These lesions may occur {{in one eye}} or both; the number of lesions varies between patients. Chorodial tubercules may serve as important symptoms of <b>miliary</b> tuberculosis, since their presence can often confirm suspected diagnosis.|$|E
5000|$|Buhl {{is remembered}} {{for his work}} with {{infectious}} diseases, in particular, pioneer research of <b>miliary</b> tuberculosis. With Austrian pathologist Franz Dittrich (1815-1859) is obtained the [...] "Buhl-Dittrich law", a supposition that states that [...] "In every case of acute <b>miliary</b> tuberculosis, there exists at least one old focus of causation in the body".|$|E
50|$|If left untreated, <b>miliary</b> {{tuberculosis}} {{is almost}} always fatal. Although most cases of <b>miliary</b> tuberculosis are treatable, the mortality rate among children with <b>miliary</b> tuberculosis remains 15 to 20% and for adults 25 to 30%. One of the main causes for these high mortality rates includes late detection of disease caused by non-specific symptoms. Non-specific symptoms include: coughing, weight loss, or organ dysfunction. These symptoms may be implicated in numerous disorders, thus delaying diagnosis. Misdiagnosis with tuberculosis meningitis is also a common occurrence when patients are tested for tuberculosis, since the two forms of tuberculosis have high rates of co-occurrence.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Miliary</b> {{tuberculosis}} {{is a form}} {{of tuberculosis}} that is characterized by a wide dissemination into the human body and by the tiny size of the lesions (1-5 mm). Its name comes from a distinctive pattern seen on a chest radiograph of many tiny spots distributed throughout the lung fields with the appearance similar to millet seeds—thus the term [...] "miliary" [...] tuberculosis. <b>Miliary</b> TB may infect any number of organs, including the lungs, liver, and spleen. <b>Miliary</b> tuberculosis is present in about 2% of all reported cases of tuberculosis and accounts for up to 20% of all extra-pulmonary tuberculosis cases.|$|E

50|$|<b>Miliary</b> fever was {{a medical}} {{term in the}} past (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's death report showed this term), used to {{indicate}} a general cause of infectious disease that cause an acute fever and skin rashes similar to the cereal grain called proso millet.After subsequent advances in medicine, this term fell into disuse, supplanted by other more specific names of diseases, for example the modern <b>miliary</b> tuberculosis.|$|E
50|$|Testing for <b>miliary</b> {{tuberculosis}} {{is conducted}} {{in a similar manner}} as for other forms of tuberculosis, although a number of tests must be conducted on a patient to confirm diagnosis. Tests include chest x-ray, sputum culture, bronchoscopy, open lung biopsy, head CT/MRI, blood cultures, fundoscopy, and electrocardiography. The tuberculosis (TB) blood test, also called an Interferon Gamma Release Assay or IGRA, is a way to diagnose latent TB.A variety of neurological complications have been noted in <b>miliary</b> tuberculosis patients—tuberculous meningitis and cerebral tuberculomas being the most frequent. However, a majority of patients improve following antituberculous treatment. Rarely lymphangitic spread of lung cancer could mimic <b>miliary</b> pattern of tuberculosis on regular chest X-ray.|$|E
