5|$|The Uranian {{satellite}} {{system is the}} least massive among those of the giant planets. Indeed, the combined mass of the five major satellites {{is less than half}} that of Triton (the seventh-largest <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System) alone. The largest of the satellites, Titania, has a radius of 788.9km, or less than half that of the Moon, but slightly more than that of Rhea, the second-largest moon of Saturn, making Titania the eighth-largest <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System. Uranus is about 10,000times more massive than its moons.|$|E
5|$|Margaret is {{the only}} known {{irregular}} prograde moon of Uranus, and it currently has the most eccentric orbit of any <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System, though Neptune's moon Nereid has a higher mean eccentricity. As of 2008, Margaret's eccentricity is 0.7979.|$|E
5|$|Aravan {{is known}} as Kuttantavar in the {{religious}} sect which bears his name, and {{in which he is}} the chief deity. His main temple is in Koovagam, Tamil Nadu. Here, the marriage of Aravan and Mohini, Krishna's female form, and her widowhood and mourning, after Aravan's sacrifice, forms the central theme of an 18-day annual festival either side of the night of the full <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tamil month of Cittirai (April–May).

5|$|For {{scenes in}} the film that {{featured}} the <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background, a circle was drawn on a screen which was lit {{to make it look}} like the moon. Though having other lights were not possible, Bartley made sure that all the characters in such scenes had their shadows away from the moon. Despite this, many of the transformations of elements in this film were shown using dissolve techniques. No lights were hidden behind the painted moon, as a source for lighting.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede is {{the largest}} and most massive <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System. Its {{diameter}} of 5,268km is 0.41 times that of Earth, 2% larger than that of Saturn's Titan (the second-largest moon), 1.08 times Mercury's, 1.09 times Callisto's, 1.45 times Io's and 1.51 times the Moon's. Its mass is 10% greater than Titan's, 38% greater than Callisto's, 66% greater than Io's and 2.02 times that of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} prevents the solar wind, {{a stream of}} ionized particles emitted by the Sun, from interacting directly with its atmosphere, and instead diverts {{it away from the}} planet, effectively creating a cavity in the solar wind flow, called a magnetosphere, composed of a plasma {{different from that of the}} solar wind. The Jovian (i.e. pertaining to Jupiter) magnetosphere is so large that the Sun and its visible corona would fit inside it with room to spare. If one could see it from Earth, it would appear five times larger than the full <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky despite being nearly 1700 times farther away.|$|E
5|$|Other <b>moons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System {{are also}} tidally heated, and they too may {{generate}} additional heat through the friction of subsurface magma or water oceans.

5|$|Neptune has 14 known moons, {{which are}} named for minor water deities in Greek mythology. By {{far the largest}} of them is Triton, {{discovered}} by William Lassell on October 10, 1846, just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself; over a century passed before {{the discovery of the}} second natural satellite, Nereid. Neptune's Neso, which has an orbital period of about 26 Julian years, orbits further from its planet than any other <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Oberon, also {{designated}} , is {{the outermost}} major moon {{of the planet}} Uranus. It is the second-largest and second most massive of the Uranian moons, and the ninth most massive <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System. Discovered by William Herschel in 1787, Oberon is named after the mythical king of the fairies who appears as a character in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Its orbit lies partially outside Uranus's magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|Other supernatural {{abilities}} commonly {{attributed to}} the kitsune include possession, mouths or tails that generate fire or lightning (known as kitsunebi), willful manifestation in the dreams of others, flight, invisibility, {{and the creation of}} illusions so elaborate as to be almost indistinguishable from reality. Some tales speak of kitsune with even greater powers, able to bend time and space, drive people mad, or take fantastic shapes such as a tree of incredible height or a second <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky. Other kitsune have characteristics reminiscent of vampires or succubi and feed on the life or spirit of human beings, generally through sexual contact.|$|E
50|$|The Other Planets' Moons: Besides our planet's moon, {{there are}} all <b>the</b> other <b>moons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> universe. Some have been named Phobos, Deimos, Europa, Io, and Titan.

5|$|The {{intermediate}} inclinations 60° < i < 140° are {{devoid of}} known moons due to <b>the</b> Kozai instability. <b>In</b> this instability region, solar perturbations at apoapse cause the moons to acquire large eccentricities {{that lead to}} collisions with inner satellites or ejection. <b>The</b> lifetime of <b>moons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> instability region is from 10 million to a billion years.|$|R
5|$|Saturn (9.5AU), {{distinguished}} by its extensive ring system, has several similarities to Jupiter, {{such as its}} atmospheric composition and magnetosphere. Although Saturn has 60% of Jupiter's volume, it {{is less than a}} third as massive, at 95 Earth masses. Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water. The rings of Saturn are made up of small ice and rock particles. Saturn has 62 confirmed satellites composed largely of ice. Two of these, Titan and Enceladus, show signs of geological activity. Titan, the second-largest <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System, is larger than Mercury and the only satellite in the Solar System with a substantial atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{altitude}} of the <b>Moon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky {{varies with the}} lunar phase and the season of the year. The full moon is highest during winter. The 18.61-year nodes cycle also has an influence: when the ascending node of the lunar orbit is in the vernal equinox, the lunar declination can {{go as far as}} 28° each month. This means the Moon can go overhead at latitudes up to 28° from the equator, instead of only 18°. The orientation of the Moon's crescent also depends on the latitude of the observation site: close to the equator, an observer can see a smile-shaped crescent moon.|$|E
5|$|The planet's {{most famous}} feature is its {{prominent}} ring {{system that is}} composed mostly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 62 moons are known to orbit Saturn, of which 53 are officially named. This {{does not include the}} hundreds of moonlets in the rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon, and the second-largest in the Solar System, is larger than the planet Mercury, although less massive, and is the only <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{remaining}} irregular moons, Sao and Laomedeia follow prograde orbits, whereas Halimede, Psamathe and Neso follow retrograde orbits. Given {{the similarity of}} their orbits, {{it was suggested that}} Neso and Psamathe could have a common origin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> break-up of a larger moon. Psamathe and Neso have the largest orbits of any natural satellites discovered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar system to date. They take 25 years to orbit Neptune at an average of 125 times the distance between Earth and the Moon. Neptune has the largest Hill sphere <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System, owing primarily to its large distance from the Sun; this allows it to retain control of such distant moons. Nevertheless, Jupiter's S/2003 J 2 orbits at the greatest percentage of the primary's Hill radius of all <b>the</b> <b>moons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System on average, and <b>the</b> Jovian <b>moons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Carme and Pasiphae groups orbit at a greater percentage of their primary's Hill radius than Psamathe and Neso.|$|R

5|$|The tidal {{forces are}} about 1,000 times {{stronger}} than the Moon's effect on Earth. The only other <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System exhibiting water vapor plumes is Enceladus. The estimated eruption rate at Europa is about 7000kg/s compared to about 200kg/s for the plumes of Enceladus.

5|$|Titan is {{the sixth}} {{ellipsoidal}} moon from Saturn. Frequently {{described as a}} planet-like moon, Titan is 50% larger than Earth's Moon, and it is 80% more massive. It is the second-largest <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System, after Jupiter's moon Ganymede, and {{is larger than the}} smallest planet, Mercury, but only 40% as massive. Discovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, Titan was the first known moon of Saturn, and the sixth known planetary satellite (after Earth's Moon and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter). Titan orbits Saturn at 20 Saturn radii. From Titan's surface, Saturn subtends an arc of 5.09 degrees and would appear 11.4 times larger in the sky than the Moon from Earth.|$|E
5|$|Callisto (Jupiter IV) is {{the fourth}} and last Galilean moon, and is the second largest of the four, and at 4820.6 {{kilometers}} in diameter, it is the third largest <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System, and barely smaller than Mercury, though {{only a third of}} the latter's mass. It is named after the Greek mythological nymph Callisto, a lover of Zeus who was a daughter of the Arkadian King Lykaon and a hunting companion of the goddess Artemis. The moon does not form part of the orbital resonance that affects three inner Galilean satellites and thus does not experience appreciable tidal heating. Callisto is composed of approximately equal amounts of rock and ices, which makes it the least dense of the Galilean moons. It {{is one of the most}} heavily cratered satellites in the Solar System, and one major feature is a basin around 3000km wide called Valhalla.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{diversity}} {{and quantity of}} <b>moons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System suggest a manifold population of natural satellites exist around extrasolar planets. Of peculiar interest from an astrobiological perspective, the number of sizable <b>moons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stellar habitable zones may outnumber planets in these circumstellar regions. With technological and theoretical methods now allowing {{for the detection of}} sub-Earth-sized extrasolar planets, the first detection of an extrasolar <b>moon</b> appears feasible. <b>In</b> this review, we summarize formation channels of massive exomoons that are potentially detectable with current or near-future instruments. We discuss the orbital effects that govern exomoon evolution, we present a framework to characterize an exomoon's stellar plus planetary illumination as well as its tidal heating, and we address the techniques that have been proposed to search for exomoons. Most notably, we show that natural satellites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> range of 0. 1 - 0. 5 Earth mass (i) are potentially habitable, (ii) can form within the circumplanetary debris and gas disk or via capture from a binary, and (iii) are detectable with current technology...|$|R
5|$|During its {{period of}} migration, Neptune {{is thought to}} have {{captured}} a large KBO, Triton, which is the only large <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System with a retrograde orbit (it orbits opposite to Neptune's rotation). This suggests that, unlike the large moons of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, which are thought to have coalesced from rotating discs of material around their young parent planets, Triton was a fully formed body that was captured from surrounding space. Gravitational capture of an object is not easy: it requires some mechanism to slow down the object enough to be caught by the larger object's gravity. A possible explanation is that Triton was part of a binary when it encountered Neptune. (Many KBOs are members of binaries. See below.) Ejection of the other member of the binary by Neptune could then explain Triton's capture. Triton is only 14% larger than Pluto, and spectral analysis of both worlds shows that their surfaces are largely composed of similar materials, such as methane and carbon monoxide. All this points to the conclusion that Triton was once a KBO that was captured by Neptune during its outward migration.|$|E
5|$|More than 800,000 Varkaris {{travel to}} Pandharpur for the yatra on Shayani Ekadashi, the 11th {{day of the}} waxing <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lunar month of Ashadha. Both Shayani Ekadashi and Prabodhini Ekadashi (in the waxing half of Kartik), are {{associated}} with the mythology of Vishnu. Hindus believe that Vishnu falls asleep in Ksheersagar (a cosmic ocean of milk), while lying on the back of Shesha-nāga (the cosmic serpent). His sleep begins on Shayani Ekadashi (literally the 'sleeping 11th') and he finally awakens from his slumber, four months later, on Prabodhini Ekadashi. The celebrations in Ashadha and Kartik continue until the full-moon in those months, concluding with torchlight processions. Inscriptions dating to the 11thcentury mention the Ekadashi pilgrimages to Pandharpur. On Shayani Ekadashi and Prabodini Ekadashi, the chief minister or a minister of Maharashtra state performs ritual components of worship on behalf of the Government of Maharashtra. This form of worship is known as sarkari-mahapuja.|$|E
5|$|Oberon is {{the second}} largest and most massive of the Uranian moons after Titania, and the ninth most massive <b>moon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System. Oberon's density of 1.63g/cm³, which {{is higher than the}} typical density of Saturn's satellites, {{indicates}} that it consists of roughly equal proportions of water ice and a dense non-ice component. The latter could be made of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds. The presence of water ice is supported by spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of the}} moon. Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Oberon's trailing hemisphere than on the leading hemisphere. This is the opposite of what is observed on other Uranian moons, where the leading hemisphere exhibits stronger water ice signatures. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to impact gardening (the creation of soil via impacts) of the surface, which is stronger on the leading hemisphere. Meteorite impacts tend to sputter (knock out) ice from the surface, leaving dark non-ice material behind. The dark material itself may have formed as a result of radiation processing of methane clathrates or radiation darkening of other organic compounds.|$|E
