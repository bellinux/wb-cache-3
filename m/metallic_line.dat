40|$|Abstract. The multi-carrier {{modulation}} {{is used in}} many applications, primary for {{a wireless}} transmission, for example Wi-Fi and WiMAX networks or DVB-T. But the same physical principle can be used also for <b>metallic</b> <b>lines</b> in access or local networks, for example ADSL and VDSL. The multi-carrier modulation in these cases is called DMT. The dominant source of noise in multi-pair metallic cables is crosstalk when the information capacity is limited dra-matically. However, information capacity of <b>metallic</b> <b>lines</b> can be increased, if the system is using MIMO principles, concrete VDMT modulation and line bounding concept. The methods for VDMT modulation and partial crosstalk cancellation are discussed and simulation results are presented...|$|R
40|$|Low {{frequency}} oscillation, {{typical for}} Gamma Doradus g-mode type stellar core sensitive pulsation, {{as well as}} higher frequency Delta Scuti type pulsation typical for p-modes, sensitive to the envelope, make HD 8801 a remarkable hybrid pulsator {{with the potential to}} probe a stellar structure over a wide range of radius. In addition HD 8801 is a rare pulsating <b>metallic</b> <b>line</b> (Am) star. We determined the astrophysical fundamental parameters to locate HD 8801 in the HR diagram. We analyzed the element abundances, paying close attention to the errors involved, and confirm the nature of HD 8801 as a <b>metallic</b> <b>line</b> (Am) star. We also determined an upper limit on the magnetic field strength. Our abundance analysis is based on classical techniques, but uses for the final step a model atmosphere calculated with the abundances determined by us. We also discuss spectropolarimetric observations obtained for HD 8801. This object is remarkable in several respects. It is a non-magnetic <b>metallic</b> <b>line</b> (Am) star, pulsating simultaneously in p- and g-modes, but also shows oscillations with periods in between these two domains, whose excitation requires explanation. Overall, the pulsational incidence in unevolved classical Am stars is believed to be quite low; HD 8801 does not conform to this picture. Finally, about 75 % of Am stars are located in short-period binaries, but {{there is no evidence that}} HD 8801 has a companion.

Silicon (, p-type) was oxidized and the microaccelerometer structure was patterned by photolithography.

Contrary to the result of Dravins et al. (1977), the line profile corresponding to the phase just before the maximum acceleration (monitored twice here), does not show any emission feature. Thus, the Ca ii K emission may be of transient nature. Consequently, {{the intensity of the}} shock wave should be weak and strongly variable.
