In this paper, a long-term operating plan is optimized mainly for capacity utilization analysis. Firstly, a model is developed to minimize railcars’ average staying time with the constraints of minimum time intervals, <b>marshalling</b> <b>track</b> capacity, and so forth. Secondly, an algorithm is designed to solve this model based on genetic algorithm (GA) and simulation method. It divides the plan of whole planning horizon into many subplans, and optimizes them with GA one by one in order to obtain a satisfactory plan with less computing time. Finally, some numeric examples are constructed to analyze (1) the convergence of the algorithm, (2) the effect of some algorithm parameters, and (3) the influence of arrival train flow on the algorithm...|$|E

50|$|Motorsport marshals {{contribute}} to enjoyable, efficient, and safer motor racing. They {{are responsible for}} the safety of competitors and are stationed at various points of danger around race tracks to assist them in case of any collisions, accidents or <b>track</b> problems. <b>Marshals</b> are also known as course workers, corner workers, corner crews, turn <b>marshals,</b> corner <b>marshals,</b> <b>track</b> safety workers, or other equivalents around the world.|$|R
50|$|Reuth {{station has}} existed {{since the start}} of the route. Following works at the end of the 19th century, the station had three through <b>tracks,</b> various <b>marshalling</b> <b>tracks</b> and a total of 17 sets of points. Until the {{restoration}} of the second track, Reuth was used for crossing trains. Since the end of the 1990s, there has been only a crossover and a siding.|$|R
50|$|Until the {{nationalisation}} of both railways in 1882, transfers {{between the}} two lines were carried out via a bay platform south of the building. Later a connection protected by signals and four <b>marshalling</b> <b>tracks</b> between the through tracks {{to the east and}} the west was built, along with a turntable with a diameter of 13 metres and a three-road roundhouse. The tracks for handling freight were extended considerably to the south and a new hump was built in 1912.|$|R

50|$|Often a Chief <b>Track</b> <b>Marshal's</b> {{responsibilities}} {{will include}} the supervision and briefing of marshals for all daily activities, allocation of day-to-day marshaling duties; provision of marshal's vehicles, training of all marshals for incident handling, flag signalling, fire fighting, communications and basic track first aid as well as monitoring of health and safety on site {{to ensure the safety}} of all guests and personnel off-track. During the race the Chief <b>Track</b> <b>Marshal's</b> role is running the radio “network” and communication with all other <b>track</b> <b>marshals</b> as “net control”.|$|R
50|$|After fleeing to New York City and {{securing}} money, weapons and fake identification, Roberts surveilles Chinese diplomat Xiang Chen, {{the other man}} from the parking garage. In Chicago, Gerard and the Marshals pursue several leads, including Roberts' girlfriend Marie Bineaux. Roberts secretly contacts Bineaux to explain that he secretly worked {{for the government and}} was ambushed during a routine exchange, killing the men before realizing they were DSS agents. The <b>Marshals</b> <b>track</b> the airplane mechanic who was bribed to hide the zip gun and discover too late that he has been murdered by Chen.|$|R

50|$|In {{qualifying}} Christian Sarron {{went down}} hard and was heaved roughly off the tarmac by <b>track</b> <b>marshals,</b> which brought complaints from riders {{that the race}} organization was unprofessional.|$|R
5000|$|In motorsports, such as auto racing, {{motorcycle}} racing, and rallying, the <b>track</b> <b>marshals</b> wave {{the racing}} flags and assist crashed or broken-down vehicles and their drivers, while pit marshals {{watch over the}} procedures in the pits, and fire marshals assist {{in the event of}} a fire on the track or in the pit. The FIA http://www.fia.com/resources/documents/1653003624__Appendix_H_a.pdf provides general rules and recommendations on marshalling. In the 1977 South African Grand Prix, 1977 Japanese Grand Prix, 2000 Italian Grand Prix, 2001 Australian Grand Prix, and 2013 Canadian Grand Prix, <b>track</b> <b>marshals</b> were victims of fatal accidents.|$|R
50|$|The Cuckoo Cars Driving School is a ride at Alton Towers {{for young}} children. It is styled as a mock driving {{institution}} where young children {{learn how to}} drive small cars. Riders are allowed to drive around a miniature course, where they are overseen by <b>marshals.</b> The <b>track</b> is mainly built and themed around the area, Cloud Cuckoo Land. It is decorated with colourful statues and scenery.|$|R

5000|$|... 1996: Race {{ended with}} 1 1/2 laps {{remaining}} (93 of 95 laps completed) because of fatal crash on Lake Shore Boulevard. Driver Jeff Krosnoff and a <b>track</b> <b>marshal</b> {{were killed and}} the race was stopped near the impact point a lap later.|$|R
2500|$|When a rider crashes, <b>track</b> <b>marshals</b> up the <b>track</b> {{from the}} {{incident}} wave yellow flags, prohibiting passing in that area; one corner {{farther up the}} track, a stationary yellow flag is shown. If a fallen rider cannot be evacuated safely from the track, the race is red-flagged. Motorcycle crashes are usually one of two types: lowside, when the bike loses either front or rear tire grip and slides out on the [...] "low" [...] side, and the more dangerous highside, when the tires don't completely slide out, but instead grip the track surface, flipping the bike over to the [...] "high side", usually catapulting the rider over the top. Increased use of traction control has made highsides much less frequent.|$|R
50|$|Between 1860 and 1870 {{a station}} {{building}} was built. At {{the same time}} an extensive area was developed for rail freight, including a <b>marshalling</b> yard, loading <b>tracks</b> and a locomotive depot with a turntable and a roundhouse because Elberfeld station had no room for such facilities.|$|R
50|$|Races are {{carefully}} monitored by <b>track</b> <b>marshals</b> placed at intervals {{around the track}} and the individual known as the 'Starter', positioned on a rostrum at the start/finish line who issues instructions to competing drivers via a system of flags and, in some cases, traffic light signals.|$|R
5|$|At the September 2011 {{meeting of}} the FIA World Motor Sport Council, representatives of the member organisations voted to amend the rules for double-waved yellow flags in all FIA-sanctioned championships.

50|$|The station had local importance. In {{addition}} to the two rail tracks (tracks 1 and 2), each with a platform, it had a fast reversible bypass track (<b>track</b> 3), three <b>marshalling</b> and stabling <b>tracks</b> (tracks 4-6), {{as well as a}} siding for freight trains to the nearby Mannesmann lime plant.|$|R

5000|$|The Cherokee Strip land rush {{happened}} on September 16, 1893. The new town of Perry, Oklahoma, was created, and Bill Tilghman was appointed city marshal of Perry on October 21, 1893. Heck Thomas {{was hired as}} assistant marshal. Both Tilghman and Thomas retained their commissions as deputy U.S. marshals. Once law and order was established in Perry, Tilghman went back {{on the trail of}} the Doolin gang. There is a famous, and totally fictional, story told about how Tilghman entered a [...] "dugout" [...] on January 8, 1895. Tilghman supposedly detected the tips of several rifles pointed at him, from hidden positions in the dugout. According to this story, one of the hidden outlaws attempted to shoot Tilghman in the back, but was prevented from doing so by Bill Doolin himself, who stated: [...] "Bill Tilghman is too good a man to shoot in the back." [...] Slow but sure, the Doolin gang was exterminated. Chris Madsen's posse killed [...] "Tulsa Jack" [...] Blake on April 4, 1895. George [...] "Bitter Creek" [...] Newcomb and Charley Pierce were killed on May 2. Then on September 6, 1895, Tilghman and two other deputy <b>marshals</b> <b>tracked</b> down William F. [...] "Little Bill" [...] Raidler. After being ordered to surrender, Raidler opened fire and was brought down by a blast from Tilghman's shotgun. The outlaw survived his wounds and was sentenced to ten years.|$|R
5|$|Members of the Westerfield Club hire Brisco County, Jr. (Bruce Campbell), {{the son of}} {{the slain}} U.S. <b>Marshal,</b> to <b>track</b> and re-capture Bly (Billy Drago) and his gang. The Westerfield Club's timid lawyer, Socrates Poole (Christian Clemenson) relays {{instructions}} and financial support to Brisco. Another bounty hunter, Lord Bowler (Julius Carry), who is known for his expert tracking skills, also hopes to capture Bly. Bitter over the elder County's fame, Bowler treats Brisco as a rival. The two men often find themselves reluctantly joining forces to achieve a common goal. Later in the series, Brisco and Bowler work together as partners and friends.|$|R
50|$|From the mid 1950s, {{almost all}} of Betzdorf’s railway tracks and {{facilities}} were closed, including the repair shop, the locomotive depot, the Deutsche Bundesbahn operations office, the <b>marshalling</b> yard, the <b>track</b> maintenance office, the signalling maintenance office, the station administration and the freight handling facilities, so now Betzdorf is only a junction for passenger services.|$|R
50|$|They hold {{different}} duties than a <b>track</b> <b>marshal,</b> as {{they are}} isolated from other marshals with radio cars spaced out {{along the length of}} a stage. They are there {{for the safety of the}} competitors, but in spectated rallies, they also may be required to control any spectators that may be posing a safety risk.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1900s, {{motorcycle}} races were run on high, banked, wooden race tracks called board tracks. During the 1920s, many of the races on the AAA Championship circuit were run on such board tracks.Modern racetracks are designed with spectator safety being paramount, following incidents of spectator and <b>track</b> <b>marshals</b> fatalities. These often involve run off areas, barriers, and high fencing.|$|R
50|$|CCS {{brings a}} team of {{professionals}} and volunteers to help administer each event, including race officials, <b>track</b> <b>marshals,</b> corner workers, administrators, etc. They also receive support from the events' venues, including safety workers, track management, gate attendants, etc. It takes 40-50 people to properly staff a normal event {{and as many as}} 70 to work a road course like Road America.|$|R
