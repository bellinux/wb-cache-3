Materials and methods: Between October 2015 and February 2016, 234 consecutive patients (167 men and 67 women; mean age: 65. 6 years; standard deviation: 16. 3) diagnosed with OAB and receiving <b>mirabegron</b> monotherapy were enrolled retrospectively. Four weeks after <b>mirabegron</b> treatment, a global response assessment (GRA) was performed for all patients and analyses were performed to identify possible predictors of successful <b>mirabegron</b> treatment (defined as GRA ≥  1). <b>Mirabegron</b> was intended being given for at least 12 weeks. Adverse events (AEs) and reasons for discontinuing <b>mirabegron</b> were recorded between 4 and 12 weeks of following-up. Results: The rate of successful <b>mirabegron</b> treatment (GRA ≥  1) was 70. 5 %. The proportion of patients with a successful response was significantly higher in men than in women (75. 3 % vs. 60. 5 %, p =  0. 022). The success rates as well as the percentage of older patients between groups with or without diabetes, hypertension, nocturia, urge incontinence, or prior anticholinergic treatment were not significantly different. Multivariable analysis showed that male sex was a significant independent predictor (p <  0. 05) for successful treatment. The overall rate of AEs was 3. 8 %, including five cases with hypertension (2. 1 %) and three with severe voiding difficulty (1. 3 %).

40|$|We have {{reviewed}} {{the safety and}} tolerability of β 3 -adrenoceptor agonists, specifically <b>mirabegron</b> and solabegron, a newly emerging drug class {{for the treatment of}} the overactive bladder syndrome. We discuss them mechanistically in the context of expression and other preclinical data. Based on a systematic PubMed search, incidence of overall adverse events, hypertension, dry mouth, and constipation are comparable between <b>mirabegron</b> or solabegron and placebo. Hypertension is the most frequently observed adverse event, but has a similar incidence with <b>mirabegron</b> and placebo. Nevertheless, severe uncontrolled hypertension has become a contraindication for use of <b>mirabegron</b> based on observation of severe hypertension in association with <b>mirabegron</b> exposure.

40|$|Objective: <b>Mirabegron,</b> a β 3 -adrenoceptor agonist, {{has been}} shown to be {{effective}} and safe in the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of <b>mirabegron</b> (50  mg) versus placebo in Taiwanese patients with OAB. Materials and patients: This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active-controlled trial conducted at 12 sites in Taiwan. Patients were randomized in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio to receive placebo, <b>mirabegron</b> (50  mg), or tolterodine extended release (4  mg) orally once daily for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was the change in the mean number of micturitions per 24 hours from baseline to the final visit. Secondary end points were volume voided, and the number of urgency, urinary incontinence, urge incontinence, and nocturia episodes per 24 hours; in addition, the King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) was administered to assess effects on quality of life. Results: A total of 218 patients were included in the full analysis set (68 in the placebo group; 76 in the <b>mirabegron</b> group; and 74 in the tolterodine group). The adjusted mean difference between the <b>mirabegron</b> and placebo groups for the change in mean number of micturitions per 24 hours was − 1. 42 (p =  0. 004). The adjusted mean difference between the <b>mirabegron</b> and placebo groups with regard to the change in volume voided per micturition was 16. 7  mL (p =  0. 013).

40|$|AbstractPurposeThe {{objective}} {{of these studies}} was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, safety, and tolerability of <b>mirabegron,</b> a β 3 -adrenoceptor agonist {{for the treatment of}} overactive bladder, including food effects (low- or high-fat meals) and sex, in healthy East Asian subjects. MethodsIn total, 5 pharmacokinetic studies of <b>mirabegron</b> were conducted in healthy East Asian subjects. Food effects were assessed in 3 randomized, single-dose studies in young Japanese male subjects (study 1), male and female subjects (study 2), and young Taiwanese male and female subjects (study 3). In the other 2 single- and multiple-dose studies in young Chinese male and female subjects (study 4 and study 5), <b>mirabegron</b> was administered as a single dose under fasted conditions. After the washout period, <b>mirabegron</b> was administered once daily under fed conditions for 8 days. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using noncompartmental methods. Safety and tolerability assessments included physical examinations, vital signs, 12 -lead ECG, clinical laboratory tests (biochemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), and adverse event monitoring. FindingsAfter administration of single oral doses of <b>mirabegron,</b> exposure under fed conditions was lower than under fasted conditions in Japanese and Taiwanese subjects. In Japanese subjects, a greater reduction in <b>mirabegron</b> Cmax and AUC 0 –∞ was observed after a low-fat meal compared with a high-fat meal. In Chinese subjects, Cmax was reached at approximately 4. 0 hours after single oral doses. <b>Mirabegron</b> accumulated 2 - to 3 -fold on once-daily dosing of multiple-dose relative to single-dose data. Steady state was reached within 7 days. After administration of <b>mirabegron,</b> mean values for Cmax and AUC in female subjects were higher than those in male subjects. <b>Mirabegron</b> was well tolerated in Japanese, Taiwanese, and Chinese subjects. ImplicationsOur studies confirm the higher exposure levels of <b>mirabegron</b> in female compared with male East Asian subjects as found earlier in Western subjects. Furthermore, the effects of food on the pharmacokinetic profiles appeared to be similar among the 3 populations tested in our studies. The findings suggest that there are no significant pharmacokinetic differences among the Japanese, Taiwanese, and Chinese populations...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: <b>Mirabegron</b> {{has been}} {{classified}} as a β-adrenoceptor agonist approved for overactive bladder syndrome. We investigated possible cardiac effects of <b>mirabegron</b> in the absence or presence of β-adrenoceptor subtype antagonists. In view of its phenylethanolamine structure, we investigated whether <b>mirabegron</b> has indirect sympathomimetic activity by using neuronal uptake blockers. Experimental Approach: Right atrial trabeculae, from non-failing hearts, were paced and contractile force measured at 37 °C. Single concentrations of <b>mirabegron</b> were added in the absence or presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine (IBMX), β (L- 748, 337), β (CGP 20712 A), β (ICI 118, 551) -adrenoceptor antagonists, neuronal uptake inhibitors desipramine or phenoxybenzamine.

40|$|AIMS: To assess patient-reported {{outcomes}} (PROs) {{in patients with}} overactive bladder (OAB) receiving the novel β 3 -adrenoceptor agonist <b>mirabegron.</b> METHODS: Data from a randomised, double-blind, controlled phase III trial in 1, 987 patients aged ≥ 18 years with OAB symptoms for ≥ 3 months were analysed. Patients received placebo, <b>mirabegron</b> 50 or 100 [*]mg/day, or tolterodine extended release (ER) 4 [*]mg orally once daily for 12 weeks after a 2 -week placebo run-in. Prespecified analysis of PROs (changes in OAB Questionnaire [OAB-q], Patient Perception of Bladder Condition [PPBC], and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: Specific Health Problem [WPAI-SHP] instrument) in patients treated with <b>mirabegron</b> 50 [*]mg/day, tolterodine ER 4 [*]mg/day or placebo is reported. Post-hoc analyses of OAB-q, PPBC and the Treatment Satisfaction-Visual Analogue Scale (TS-VAS) in patients who were incontinent at baseline are also reported. RESULTS: Significant improvements over placebo in OAB-q coping and concern from baseline to final visit were observed with <b>mirabegron</b> 50 [*]mg/day. No significant improvements in these parameters were observed with tolterodine ER 4 [*]mg/day. <b>Mirabegron</b> 50 [*]mg/day significantly increased the proportion of patients showing a PPBC improvement over placebo. <b>Mirabegron</b> 50 [*]mg/day also produced greater improvements in WPAI-SHP presenteeism and greater reductions in absenteeism and overall work impairment than placebo or tolterodine ER 4 [*]mg/day. The impact of <b>mirabegron</b> 50 [*]mg/day treatment on PROs in the incontinent population appears to be greater than that in the overall OAB population. CONCLUSIONS: At the approved dose of 50 [*]mg/day, <b>mirabegron</b> significantly improves OAB patients' perception of disease and quality of life, independent of whether they are incontinent at baseline.

40|$|To {{critically}} analyse available phase II and III randomised control trials (RCTs) reporting clinical {{data about}} the efficacy and tolerability of <b>Mirabegron</b> (a β 3 -adrenoceptor agonist) {{in the treatment of}} overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome. A review of the literature was performed in September 2013 using the MEDLINE database. A 'free text' protocol was used for the search strategy using 'overactive bladder' and 'Mirabegron' as keywords. Subsequently, the searches were pooled and limited to phase II and III RCTs. Two phase II and five phase III RCTs were selected and analysed. The available phase II studies showed the efficacy and tolerability of different doses of <b>Mirabegron</b> compared with placebo. Moreover, a dose-ranging study showed that 50 mg once daily should be considered the most promising dose for clinical use. The 12 -week phase III studies confirmed the effectiveness of <b>Mirabegron</b> to significantly reduce the mean number of incontinence episodes/ 24 h and the mean number of micturitions/ 24 h compared with placebo. A post hoc analysis confirmed that favourable results with <b>Mirabegron</b> were reported both in patients with OAB who were antimuscarinic naïve and in those who had discontinued prior antimuscarinic therapy. Moreover, a phase III trial showed the safety and tolerability of 12 -month treatment of <b>Mirabegron.</b> Discontinuation due to adverse events was low both using the 50 and 100 mg dose of <b>Mirabegron.</b> <b>Mirabegron</b> is the first of a new class of drugs for the treatment of OAB able to influence non-voiding activity and produce an increased storage capacity and inter-void interval.

40|$|Purpose Long-term {{persistence}} with pharmacotherapy for overactive bladder (OAB) {{requires a}} drug with an early {{onset of action}} and good efficacy and tolerability profile. Although antimuscarinics improve OAB symptoms within 1 – 2 weeks of initiating treatment, adherence after 3 months is relatively poor due to bothersome side effects (e. g., dry mouth and constipation). <b>Mirabegron,</b> a b 3 -adrenoceptor agonist, has demonstrated significant improvements in key symptoms of OAB and good tolerability after 12 weeks in Phase III studies. Methods This was a prespecified pooled analysis of three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12 -week studies, and a Phase II study, to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of <b>mirabegron</b> 25 and 50 mg versus placebo. The main efficacy endpoints were change from baseline to week 1 (Phase II only), week 4, and final visit in mean number of incontinence episodes/ 24 h, micturitions/ 24 h, and mean volume voided/micturition (MVV). Results A significant benefit for <b>mirabegron</b> 25 and 50 mg versus placebo was evident at the first assessment point, 4 weeks after initiation of therapy, in Phase III studies for incontinence, micturitions, and MVV.

Methods: The effectiveness and safety of <b>mirabegron</b> were analyzed through an evaluation of 	scientific evidence. The cost of different pharmacological alternatives was calculated based on their Defined Daily Dose (DDD) and their 	manufacturer’s sale price. Results: The use of <b>mirabegron</b> in the treatment of overactive bladder {{syndrome is}} 	supported by three randomized clinical trials, controlled with placebo, at 12 weeks. All three share the same primary efficacy variables (number 	 of incontinence episodes per 24 hours and number of micturitions per 24 hours).

40|$|Background: Persistence with antimuscarinic {{therapy in}} overactive bladder (OAB) is poor, {{but may be}} {{different}} for <b>mirabegron,</b> a β 3 -adrenoceptor agonist with a different adverse event profile. Objective: To compare persistence and adherence with <b>mirabegron</b> versus tolterodine extended release (ER) and other antimuscarinics in routine clinical practice over a 12 -mo period. Design, setting, and participants: Retrospective, longitudinal, observational study of anonymised data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD database. Eligibility: age ≥ 18 yr, ≥ 1 prescription for target OAB drug (between May 1, 2013 and June 29, 2014), and 12 -mo continuous enrolment {{before and after the}} index prescription date. Interventions: <b>Mirabegron,</b> darifenacin, fesoterodine, flavoxate, oxybutynin ER or immediate-release (IR), propiverine, solifenacin, tolterodine ER or IR, and trospium chloride. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The primary endpoint was persistence (time to discontinuation). Secondary endpoints included 12 -mo persistence rates and adherence (assessed using medication possession ratio, MPR). Cox proportional-hazards regression models and logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounding factors were used to compare cohorts. Analyses were repeated after 1 : 1 matching. Results and limitations: The study population included 21. 996 eligible patients. In the unmatched analysis, the median time-to-discontinuation was significantly longer for <b>mirabegron</b> (169 d, interquartile range [IQR] 41 -not reached) compared to tolterodine ER (56 d, IQR 28 - 254; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1. 55, 95 % confidence interval 1. 41 - 1. 71; p <. 0. 0001) and other antimuscarinics (range 30 - 78 d; adjusted HR range 1. 24 - 2. 26, p <. 0. 0001 for all comparisons). The 12 -mo persistence rates and MPR were also significantly greater with <b>mirabegron</b> than with all the antimuscarinics. Limitations include the retrospective design, use of prescription records to estimate outcomes, and inability to capture reasons for discontinuation. Conclusions: Persistence and adherence were statistically significantly greater with <b>mirabegron</b> than with tolterodine ER and other antimuscarinics prescribed for OAB in the UK. Patient summary: This study assessed persistence and adherence (or compliance) with medications prescribed for OAB in a large UK population. We found that patients prescribed <b>mirabegron</b> remained on treatment for longer and showed greater adherence than those prescribed traditional antimuscarinics. For chronic conditions such as overactive bladder, long-term adherence is important to maintain treatment benefit. Persistence with antimuscarinics is a recognised challenge. This analysis of a UK primary care database demonstrates that persistence and adherence are significantly greater with <b>mirabegron</b> versus antimuscarinics...|$|E
40|$|Using a videourodynamic study, we {{examined}} the efficacy of combination therapy with <b>mirabegron</b> for anticholinergic-resistant neurogenic bladder. We retrospectively studied 7 patients with neurogenic bladder (5 males and 2 females) who had detrusor overactivity (DO) or low compliance bladder (＜ 10 ml/cmH 2 O) despite taking anticholinergic medication. Bladder deformity was categorized from G 0 to G 3 by Ogawa’s classification. Mean age of study patients was 51 years (25 - 76). Underlying diseases were spinal cord injury in 3 patients, spina bifida in 2, spinal cord infarction in 1, and post-radical hysterectomy in 1. Preceding anticholinergic medication was solifenacin 5 mg in 1 patient, solifenacin 10 mg in 5, and tolterodine 4 mg in 1. Before <b>mirabegron,</b> bladder deformity was G 1 in 4 patients, G 2 in 1 and G 3 in 2, and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was detected in 3 patients. Five and 4 patients had detrusor overactivity and low compliance bladder, respectively. Videourodynamic study was reevaluated at a mean of 7 months (2 - 12 months) after <b>mirabegron.</b> After <b>mirabegron,</b> urinary incontinence was improved in all patients. G 3 bladder deformity was improved to G 2 and G 1 in one patient each, and VUR disappeared in all 3 patients. DO disappeared in 2 of the 5 patients, and bladder compliance was improved in all 4 patients with low compliance bladder. In conclusion, combination therapy of <b>mirabegron</b> is effective and beneficial for anticholinergic-resistant neurogenic bladder...|$|E
40|$|EDITORIAL COMMENT Overactive bladder (OAB) is {{a highly}} {{prevalent}} disorder in the pediatric population. This event negatively affects and impairs children’s development. Antimuscarinics are the mainstay pharmacological management of OAB, but their side effects profile limits their use. <b>Mirabegron,</b> a new molecule with a distinct mechanism of action (b 3 -adrenoreceptor agonist), was recently approved as monotherapy for idiopathic OAB in adults but has not been studied in the pediatric population. Blais et al. have evaluated the efficacy and safety of <b>mirabegron</b> {{in the treatment of}} urinary incontinence in children with idiopathic OAB who were refractory to and/or intolerant of antimuscarinics. This prospective off-label study, using an adjusted-dose regimen of <b>mirabegron</b> (25 - 50 mg), included pediatric patients with refractory urinary incontinence due to OAB. Patients without symptom improvement or with partial response under intensive behavioral protocol and medical therapy (at least two different antimuscarinic agents) were included in the study. Their primary outcome was better reported efficacy than with the use of prior anticholinergic medication. Secondary end points were tolerability and safety. Families were questioned for continence, side effects, compliance, and Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) questionnaire. A total of 58 patients (14 girls, 44 boys) were enrolled in a <b>mirabegron</b> open-label trial. The median age at initiation of <b>mirabegron</b> was 10. 1 years [interquartile range (IQR) : 8. 8 - 13. 5]. The median duration of treatment was 11. 5 months (IQR: 6. 0 - 15. 0). The median bladder capacity improved from 150 ml to 200 ml (p< 0. 001). Continence improved in 52 of 58, with 13 being completely dry. The median PPBC score improved from 4. 0 to 2. 0 (p< 0. 001). The authors also assessed the safety of <b>mirabegron.</b> All electrocardiogram and blood tests remained normal. No significant change in blood pressure (< 5 mmHg) and heart rate (fewer than five beats per minute) was reported. Fifty patients (86...|$|E

40|$|AbstractContextMirabegron, {{the first}} β 3 -adrenoceptor agonist in {{clinical}} practice, is approved {{for treatment of}} overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome symptoms. Because β 3 -adrenoceptors are expressed in cardiovascular (CV) tissues, there are concerns that OAB treatment with β 3 -adrenoceptor agonists may affect the heart and vasculature. ObjectiveTo provide a summary of CV effects of β 3 -adrenoceptor agonists in clinical studies. Evidence acquisitionA systematic literature search from inception until November 2014 was performed on studies in PubMed and Medline. Evidence synthesisTwenty papers, published between 1994 and 2014, were identified: <b>mirabegron</b> (16), solabegron (2), AK- 677 (1), and BRL 35135 (1). More detailed CV data from <b>mirabegron</b> studies were available in online regulatory documents filed with the US Food and Drug Administration and the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. ConclusionsThe CV safety of <b>mirabegron</b> appears to be acceptable at therapeutic doses and comparable with that of antimuscarinic agents, currently first-line therapy for OAB. Patient summaryIn this review {{we looked at the}} cardiovascular (CV) effects of β 3 -adrenoceptor agonists used for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). The CV safety of <b>mirabegron</b> (the only clinically approved β 3 -adrenoceptor agonist) appears to be acceptable at therapeutic doses and comparable with that of antimuscarinic agents, the current first-line therapy for OAB...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} {{the efficacy of}} <b>mirabegron,</b> a β 3 -adrenergic agonist, in patients aged ＞ 70 years who {{did not respond to}} treatment with an anticholinergic agent. From February 2012 to May 2012, we examined 37 patients who did not respond to treatment with an anticholinergic agent. We assessed the overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS), thirst, and constipation at baseline, as well as at 3 and 6 months from thestart of drug administration. Theme an ageof thefe malepatie nts was 79. 9 ± 6. 08 years. The OABSS indicated significant improvement in nocturia and urge incontinence at 3 and 6 months. Furthermore, <b>mirabegron</b> significantly relieved thirst (in 95. 2 % of cases) and constipation (in 87. 5 % of cases).

40|$|Purpose: We {{aimed to}} assess the patient-reported outcome (PRO) and {{efficacy}} of add-on low-dose antimuscarinic therapy in overactive bladder (OAB) patients with suboptimal response to 4 -week treatment with beta 3 agonist monotherapy (<b>mirabegron,</b> 50 mg). Materials and Methods: We enrolled OAB patients with 4 -week <b>mirabegron</b> (50 mg) treatment if the patients’ symptoms improved, but not to a satisfactory extent (patient perception of bladder condition [PPBC] ≥ 4). Enrolled patients had 8 -week lowdose antimuscarinics add-on therapy (propiverine HCl, 10 mg). Patients recorded 3 -day voiding diary at screening, enrollment (after 4 weeks of <b>mirabegron</b> monotherapy) and after 8 weeks of add-on therapy. We assessed the change of PRO (PPBC) as a primary end point and the efficacy of add-on therapy (change of frequency, urgency, urinary urgency incontinence [UUI] based on voiding diary) as a secondary end point. Results: Thirty patients (mean age, 62. 3 ± 12. 8 years; mean symptom duration, 16. 0 ± 12. 3 months) were finally enrolled in the study. The mean PPBC value was 4. 3 ± 0. 4 after <b>mirabegron</b> monotherapy, and decreased to 3. 2 ± 1. 0 after 8 -week add-on therapy. The mean urinary frequency decreased from 10. 1 ± 3. 1 to 8. 8 ± 3, {{the mean number of}} urgency episodes decreased from 3. 6 ± 1. 6 to 1. 8 ± 1. 2 and the number of urgency incontinence episodes decreased from 0. 7 ± 1. 0 to 0. 2 ± 0. 5 after add-on therapy. No patients had event of acute urinary retention and three patients complained of mild dry mouth after add-on therapy. Conclusions: Add-on therapy of low-dose antimuscarinics exhibits good efficacy and safety in patients with suboptimal response after 4 -week of <b>mirabegron</b> (50 mg) monotherapy...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Background Overactive bladder (OAB) is highly pre-valent and {{is associated with}} considerable morbidity and reduced health-related quality of life. b 3 -adrenergic receptor (b 3 -AR) stimulation is a novel alternative to an-timuscarinic therapy for OAB. Objective The objective of this analysis {{was to assess the}} cost effectiveness of the b 3 -AR agonist <b>mirabegron</b> relative to tolterodine extended release (ER) in patients with OAB from a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. Methods A Markov model was developed to simulate the management, course of disease, and effect of complications in OAB patients over a period of 5 years. Transition probabilities for symptom severity levels and probabilities of adverse events were estimated from the results of the randomised, double-blind SCORPIO trial in 1, 987 patients with OAB. Other model inputs were derived from the lit-erature and on assumptions based on clinical experience. Results Total 5 -year costs per patient were £ 1, 645. 62 for <b>mirabegron</b> 50 mg/day and £ 1, 607. 75 for tolterodine ER 4 mg/day. <b>Mirabegron</b> was associated with a gain of 0. 009 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with an additional cost of £ 37. 88. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was £ 4, 386 /QALY gained. In deterministic sensitivity analyses in the general OAB population and several subgroups, ICERs remained below the generally accepted willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of £ 20, 000 / QALY gained. The probability of <b>mirabegron</b> 50 mg being cost effective relative to tolterodine ER 4 mg was 89. 4 % at the same WTP threshold. Conclusions <b>Mirabegron</b> 50 mg/day is likely to be cost effective compared with tolterodine ER 4 mg/day for adult patients with OAB from a UK NHS perspective...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundIncontinence has {{a greater}} {{detrimental}} effect on quality of life than other symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB) and {{is often difficult to}} treat with antimuscarinic monotherapy. ObjectiveTo evaluate the efficacy and the safety and tolerability of combination (solifenacin 5 mg and <b>mirabegron</b> 50 mg) versus solifenacin 5 or 10 mg in OAB patients remaining incontinent after 4 wk of solifenacin 5 mg. Design, setting, and participantsOAB patients remaining incontinent despite daily solifenacin 5 mg during 4 -wk single-blind run-in were randomised 1 : 1 : 1 to double-blind daily combination or solifenacin 5 or 10 mg for 12 wk. Patients receiving the combination were initiated on <b>mirabegron</b> 25 mg increasing to 50 mg after week 4. Outcome measurements and statistical analysisThe primary end point was a change from baseline to end of treatment (EOT) in the mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 h (stratified rank analysis of covariance [ANCOVA]). Key secondary end points were a change from baseline to EOT in the mean number of micturitions per 24 h (ANCOVA) and number of incontinence episodes noted in a 3 -d diary at EOT (mixed-effects Poisson regression). A trial (BESIDE) comparing combination treatment (solifenacin plus <b>mirabegron)</b> with one treatment alone (solifenacin) tested the superiority of combination versus solifenacin 5 mg, noninferiority (and potential superiority) of combination versus solifenacin 10 mg (key secondary end points), and the safety and tolerability of combination therapy versus solifenacin monotherapy. Results and limitationsA total of 2174 patients were randomised to combination (n= 727), solifenacin 5 mg (n= 728), or solifenacin 10 mg (n= 719). At EOT, combination was superior to solifenacin 5 mg, with significant improvements in daily incontinence (p= 0. 001), daily micturitions (p< 0. 001), and incontinence noted in a 3 -d diary (p= 0. 014). Combination was noninferior to solifenacin 10 mg for key secondary end points and superior to solifenacin 10 mg for improving daily micturitions. All treatments were well tolerated. ConclusionsAdding <b>mirabegron</b> 50 mg to solifenacin 5 mg further improved OAB symptoms versus solifenacin 5 or 10 mg, and it was well tolerated in OAB patients remaining incontinent after initial solifenacin 5 mg. Patient summaryIn this 12 -wk study, overactive bladder patients who remained incontinent despite initial solifenacin 5 mg treatment received additional treatment with <b>mirabegron</b> 50 mg. Combining <b>mirabegron</b> 50 mg with solifenacin 5 mg was superior to solifenacin 5 mg alone in improving symptoms of incontinence and frequent urination, and it was well tolerated.
