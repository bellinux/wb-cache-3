He then appeared in Edward, My Son (1949) with Deborah Kerr. Tracy disliked the role, and told director George Cukor, [...] "It's rather disconcerting to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> how easily I play a heel." [...] Upon its release, The New Yorker wrote of the [...] "hopeless miscasting of Mr. Tracy". The film became Tracy's biggest money-loser at MGM.|$|E
500|$|Elisabeth Moss {{said she}} was not told by Weiner that Peggy would be leaving SCDP [...] "until we were {{shooting}} episode 10, the one right before it. It was unusual that he didn't tell me. He usually tells me what's happening, pitches me things to ask me how they sound." [...] Moss' initial reaction [...] "was just one of feeling like {{there was really no}} other logical way to go for her. After everything that had happened for five years, she can't just keep butting her head up against that wall. [...] She's becoming her own person and she needs to have her own place not under Don." [...] Moss also said, [...] "I will thank [...] forever for not telling me. It would have made my life harder. I knew about Peggy's baby in season one. I fought against it, to play it as she was living it, feeling it, and not be in my head. Not knowing Peggy would quit allowed <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> it for myself, to really feel Peggy's growing frustration with Don all season." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{opened with}} [...] "Baba O'Riley", {{featuring}} piano and synthesizer-processed Lowrey organ by Townshend. The song's title {{pays homage to}} Townshend's guru, Meher Baba, and minimalist composer Terry Riley (and is informally known as [...] "Teenage Wasteland" [...] from {{a line in the}} lyrics). The organ track came from a longer demo by Townshend, portions of which were later included on a Baba tribute album I Am, that was edited down for the final recording. Townshend later said this part had [...] "two or three thousand edits to it". The opening lyrics to the next track, [...] "Bargain", [...] "I'd gladly lose <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> you", came from a phrase used by Baba. Entwistle wrote [...] "My Wife" [...] after having an argument with his wife and exaggerating the conflict in the lyrics. The track features several overdubbed brass instruments recorded in a single half-hour session. [...] "Pure and Easy", a key track from Lifehouse, did not make the final track selection, but the opening line was included as a coda to [...] "The Song is Over".|$|E

500|$|For {{his first}} ten years, [...] "Johnny" [...] McCain (the {{nickname}} {{he was given}} {{as part of a}} family tradition of distinguishing the generations) [...] was frequently uprooted as his family, including older sister Sandy (born 1934) and younger brother Joe (born 1942), followed his father to New London, Connecticut, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and other stations in the Pacific Ocean. Summer vacations were sometimes spent at the family's Teoc plantation, but McCain always felt his heritage was military, not Southern. [...] McCain attended whatever naval base school was available, often to the detriment of his education, as schools were sometimes substandard and their curricula often erratic. [...] After the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, his father was absent for long stretches. [...] His formal education was supplemented by the efforts of his mother, who took advantage of the family's many long-distance travels to expose him to historical and cultural sites. He later wrote, [...] "She taught <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> so much pleasure in life that misfortune could not rob me of the joy of living." [...] A Republican, she also made sure that he followed current events, although his parents avoided outward partisan affiliations due to his father's military career.|$|E
500|$|On October 25, 2005, Giants patriarch Wellington Mara {{died after}} a brief illness, {{at the age of}} 89. Mara had been {{involved}} with the Giants since he was nine years old, when he was a ball boy for the team. Mara was universally beloved by the players. Hall of Fame linebacker Harry Carson, who played during some of the team's down years in the 1970s, never became angry at Mara despite being frustrated with the team's performances. [...] "The Giants’ organization cares about its players more than most teams in the NFL. This stems from the top. The Maras are family men and Wellington, especially, has sought to cultivate a family atmosphere in the team.... If any NFL owner deserves a championship, it is Mara." [...] According to Parcells, Wellington made an effort {{to get to know each}} of his players. [...] "The Giants are Wellington Mara’s whole life, they have been his whole life. He’s at the office every day, he’s at practice very day, he loves hanging around the locker room and getting to know the players." [...] Despite his strong religious convictions, he put aside his personal beliefs, and avoided preaching to players who were having problems. [...] "Nobody did more for me than Wellington Mara." [...] Lawrence Taylor said. [...] "He didn’t have to save me, he didn’t have to keep helping <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> help.... And he never lectured me. I could tell he disapproved but he never lectured me." [...] Several players went to Mara's bedside as he was dying to say goodbye to the owner. The team dedicated their next game to Mara, and shut out the Redskins 36–0.|$|E

[...] "The series centers on the behind-the-scenes people, their heroism and their quirks," [...] McCreary explained, [...] "As such, the music I wrote is heroic and, at times, quirky and offbeat." [...] McCreary spoke at length with Whedon [...] "about the challenge of creating a score that is big enough in its orchestral presence that it feels cinematic and feels {{at home in the}} Marvel Cinematic Universe. It also must capture the intimate human characteristics that define this series. In editorial, it became clear that simply tracking in typical big 'superhero movie' music wasn’t going to work. So Joss helped guide <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a sound that lives a little in both worlds." [...] McCreary worked with several soloists throughout the series, including Oingo Boingo guitarist Steve Bartek; vocalist Raya Yarbrough; composer Jeremy Zuckerman playing the gu zheng for [...] "Girl in the Flower Dress"; and cellist Eric Buyers for when [...] "the cellist" [...] character Audrey performs in [...] "The Only Light in the Darkness".|$|E

2500|$|The philosopher John Stuart Mill liked Wordsworth's ode {{and found}} it {{influential}} {{to the formation of}} his own thoughts. In his Autobiography (1873), he credited Wordsworth's poetry as being able to relieve his mind and overcome a sense of apathy towards life. Of the poems, he particularly emphasised both Wordsworth's 1815 collection of poetry and the Ode: Intimations of Immortality as providing the most help to him, and he specifically said of the ode: [...] "I found that he too had had similar experience to mine; that he also had felt that the first freshness of youthful enjoyment of life was not lasting; but that he had sought for compensation, {{and found it}}, {{in the way in which}} he was now teaching <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> it. The result was that I gradually, but completely, emerged from my habitual depression, and was never again subject to it." [...] David Mason followed Mill in an 1875 essay on literature, including Wordsworth's poetry. After quoting from the ode, Mason claimed of the poem: [...] "These, and hundreds of other passages that might be quoted, show that Wordsworth possessed, in a very high degree indeed, the true primary quality of the poet—imagination; a surcharge of personality or vital spirit, perpetually overflowing among the objects of the otherwise conditioned universe, and refashioning them according to its pleasure." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out {{what was in the}} bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E
