25|$|<b>Mooring</b> <b>Bollard</b> (permanent) affixed canal-side on lock-approaches for the {{short-term}} mooring of advancing boats and lock-side {{to assist in}} ascent and descent.|$|E
50|$|In February 2004, a {{woman was}} killed after she was hit, while waiting for a boat, by a <b>mooring</b> <b>bollard</b> which had come loose from the Star Clipper at St. Katherine's Pier.|$|E
50|$|In a {{separate}} incident unrelated to storm activity, a departing cruise ship — while maneuvering {{to avoid a}} collision with two other departing cruise ships — passed unusually close to Stevens. The resulting wake from the passing ship tossed Stevens and caused the <b>mooring</b> <b>bollard</b> securing the bow lines {{to break away from}} its footing on the pier. The pilings and remaining lines held the ship in place without further incident.|$|E
25|$|The <b>mooring</b> <b>bollards</b> {{from the}} incline {{can be found}} {{alongside}} the locks.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Mooring</b> <b>bollards</b> {{were the}} first type of bollard: {{the use of the}} term has since expanded. Here, Hudson River in September 2005.|$|R
5000|$|In late April 2009, the {{northern}} quay was substantially complete with fenders, <b>mooring</b> <b>bollards</b> and gantry crane rails installed. The {{arrival of the}} 'Zhen Hua 6', carrying two gantry cranes manufactured by ZPMC happened on 4 May 2009.|$|R
50|$|For ease of movement, a tack {{is usually}} a single line rather than having blocks. A common arrangement, however, {{is to have a}} {{separate}} shorter tackle which can be hooked on to apply greater force over the last few feet of movement. This is shown (though not in use) in the picture. The tackle which is just visible stowed behind the <b>mooring</b> <b>bollard</b> can be hooked into the strop or loop (labelled) on the tack in order to tighten the leach further if it should be required.|$|E
50|$|The 17 ft deep hull {{accommodated}} a {{total of}} two decks, the upper deck forming a lengthy compartment divided into sections to accommodate 3000 lb of freight and mail along with a storage space and a ship's clerks office. This office contained controls such as electrical fuseboxes and circuit switches, ventilation controls, and fuelcocks. The lower deck contained a large marine compartment containing an anchor, a pair of drogues, a <b>mooring</b> <b>bollard,</b> and a boat hook, along with a step ladder to the cockpit; aft of the mooring compartment was the forward passenger saloon, followed by a central corridor flanked by the toilets and galley, a mid-ship cabin, a spacious promenade cabin, and finally an aft-cabin. The cabins could be alternatively outfitted with comfortable seating or bunks for sleeper services. Near {{the rear of the}} aircraft, a further compartment for the purpose of containing freight and mail was present which extended into the after fuselage.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{house was}} built in the 13th century, possibly earlier, by a family named Noble, believed to be Hamo's ancestors. The two story structure with a large cellar is built of local rag-stone and was, at that time, in a preeminent location on the docks in Hythe, {{on the corner of the}} 12th century road to Canterbury called Clyme Hill, via Saltwood Castle. Built of Kentish rag-stone and wide-joined rubble, the simple two story structure had an exterior staircase made of wood on the east side. The cellar, with its door facing the docks, was used for storage and trade while the ground floor and first floor were living areas. It is likely that the original cellar door and south-facing windows had rounded arches in the Norman style, that were adapted to the Gothic style at the time of the western addition. There is a large stone that goes several feet into the ground on the southeast corner of the building which is most likely a <b>mooring</b> <b>Bollard.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{remains of}} the boom and deep channel post are noted as {{potential}} hazards on shipping charts of the area. [...] A modern navigation light with accompanying <b>mooring</b> <b>bollards</b> and accessway {{is located at the}} southern end of the boom. [...] On 25 July 2015 the boom was struck by an empty and drifting fishing vessel.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mooring</b> <b>bollards</b> {{are seldom}} exactly cylindrical, but {{typically}} {{have a larger}} diameter near the top to discourage mooring warps (docklines) from coming loose. Single bollards sometimes include a cross rod to allow the mooring lines to be bent into a figure eight. Small mushroom-bollards are found on lock approaches for advancing boats waiting for lock access.|$|R
5|$|The village {{can also}} be {{accessed}} by boat. The River Great Ouse passes to the east, forming much of the village's eastern boundary, and there are <b>mooring</b> <b>bollards</b> inside the village boundary. A privately owned 1945 de Havilland Dragon Rapide, based at the Shuttleworth Trust's Old Warden airfield, passes over the village during sightseeing tours to Ely. A privately maintained light aircraft airfield is located at Bedwell Hey Farm in the village.|$|R
5000|$|Bollards and cleats {{can have}} {{multiple}} types of mooring lines tied off to them. Bow and stern lines, {{found at the}} front {{and the back of}} the vessel, are lines designed to prevent vessels from drifting perpendicular to the berth location. Breast lines come from closer to the centerline of the vessel and span along the vessel to the mooring location, to keep the vessel from drifting parallel to the berth. PIANC Report _______ can provide further details on the design of <b>mooring</b> structures. <b>Bollard</b> and cleat manufacturers can provide more details on dimensions, weights, and capacities of mooring structures ...|$|R
25|$|There are {{detailed}} traffic {{rules for}} the canal. Each vessel in passage is classified in one of six traffic groups according to its dimensions. Larger ships are obliged to accept pilots and specialised canal helmsmen, in some cases even {{the assistance of a}} tugboat. Furthermore, there are regulations regarding the passing of oncoming ships. Larger ships may also be required to <b>moor</b> at the <b>bollards</b> provided at intervals along the canal to allow the passage of oncoming vessels. Special rules apply to pleasure craft.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the closure}} of the docks in the early 1970s, the area was redeveloped by the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC). Russia Dock Woodland was made up of a number of docks, {{including}} Russia Dock, Island Dock and Surrey Basin, which were infilled (save for a thin 'stream' through the woodland) and planted as a 34.5 acre woodland in 1980. The Woodland still contains surviving dock features including the retaining wall capstones, depth gauges, <b>bollards,</b> <b>mooring</b> chains and tracks. In 1985 the LDDC added an artificial hill, Stave Hill, to the west edge of the park, using waste material and rubble. A relief map of the former docks in cast bronze by Michael Rizzello stands {{at the top of the}} hill.The woodlands were established by the LDDC and were handed over to and are now managed by Southwark Council with the assistance of the Friends of Russia Dock Woodland. The LDDC established various footbridges (including the Alfred Salter footbridge) and paths (including Waterman's path along the stream) through the woods, which are now maintained by Southwark Council. The Conservation Volunteers(formerly the Trust for Urban Ecology) maintain the neighbouring Stave Hill Ecological Park, and works closely with the Friends of Russia Dock Woodland to address issues of concern to both areas. [...] Both areas are an excellent resource for residents of and visitors to Rotherhithe.|$|R
