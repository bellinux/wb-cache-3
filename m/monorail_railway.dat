5000|$|Kearney {{patented}} {{an innovative}} underground <b>monorail</b> <b>railway</b> system, the Kearney High-Speed Tube, which used {{the effects of}} gravity to enhance acceleration and deceleration and reduce power consumption with a [...] "roller coaster" [...] type of motion; from shallow sub-surface stations, deep-level tube tunnels would fall away at a 1-in-7 gradient, enabling underground trains to reach an estimated 60 mph before slowing down as they climbed to the next station. The trains were unusual in that they would run on a single rail with four double-flanged wheels under each carriage; wheels mounted on the roof would run along an upper guide rail above the train. This upper guide rail, along with the carriages' low centre of gravity and the gyroscopic effect of motion, would stabilise the train on the lower rail and reduce the side-to-side hunting oscillation, thus preventing derailments and allowing greater speeds.|$|E
40|$|Photograph {{of track}} of <b>monorail</b> <b>railway</b> at Magnesium, ca. 1922 - 1930. At center, a single metal track {{can be seen}} {{extending}} from the extreme foreground into the extreme background. Desert and scarce vegetation {{can be seen on}} both sides of the track. In the extreme background, mountain ranges are visible. The thirty-mile long railroad, the only monorail in the United States at the time, ran from Magnesium (ten miles from Trona) to the American Magnesium Corporation property on the western edge of Death Valley...|$|E

Harney can be seen in a suit at the left of center, {{supporting}} a small railcar {{at the start}} of the 30 -mile long railroad, which was the only monorail in the United States at the time of the photograph. Wooden scaffolding covers the tracks in the background, which run off into the desert.

50|$|Most <b>monorails</b> are {{elevated}} <b>railways,</b> {{such as the}} Disneyland Monorail System (1959), the Tokyo Monorail (1964), the Sydney Monorail (1988-2013), the KL Monorail, the Las Vegas Monorail, and the São Paulo <b>Monorail.</b> Many maglev <b>railways</b> {{are also}} elevated.|$|R
50|$|There {{are various}} types of trains that are {{designed}} for particular purposes. A train can consist {{of a combination of}} one or more locomotives and attached railroad cars, or a self-propelled multiple unit (or occasionally a single or articulated powered coach, called a railcar). Trains can also be hauled by horses, pulled by a cable, or run downhill by gravity.Special kinds of trains running on corresponding special 'railways' are atmospheric <b>railways,</b> <b>monorails,</b> high-speed <b>railways,</b> maglev, rubber-tired underground, funicular and cog railways.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantages}} of the <b>monorail</b> over conventional <b>railways</b> were summarised by Shilovsky. The following have been claimed.|$|R
50|$|A <b>monorail</b> is a <b>railway</b> {{in which}} the track {{consists}} of a single rail, {{as opposed to the}} traditional track with two parallel rails.|$|R
25|$|A new {{integrated}} station named Penang Sentral {{will be built}} {{which will}} connect KTM <b>Railway,</b> <b>monorail,</b> bus and ferry service in one building at Butterworth.|$|R
25|$|Passenger rail {{transport}} is the conveyance of passengers {{by means of}} wheeled vehicles specially designed to run on railways. Trains allow high capacity on short or long distance, but require track, signalling, infrastructure and stations to be built and maintained. Urban rail transit consists of trams, light rail, rapid transit, people movers, commuter rail, <b>monorail,</b> suspension <b>railways</b> and funiculars.|$|R
50|$|In {{the field}} of rail {{transport}} equipment, Langen was co-owner and engineer of the Cologne Waggonfabrik van der Zypen & Charlier. He started the Wuppertal <b>monorail,</b> a suspension <b>railway</b> system, in 1894.|$|R
50|$|The Listowel and Ballybunion Railway was {{a highly}} unusual form of transport. It was built to the Lartigue <b>monorail</b> system. Ballybunion <b>railway</b> station opened on 6 March 1888, but finally closed on 14 October 1924.|$|R

Solved section is located between the railway station Kunčice nad Labem and the railway station Hostinné. Within the framework of this thesis recovery solutions of drainage, preparation of bills of quantities and technology design work were solved...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>monorail</b> is a <b>railway</b> {{in which}} the track {{consists}} of a single rail. The term {{is also used to}} describe the beam of the system, or the vehicles traveling on such a beam or track. The term originates from joining [...] "mono" [...] (one) and [...] "rail" [...] (rail), from 1897, possibly from German engineer Eugen Langen, who called an elevated railway system with wagons suspended the Eugen Langen One-railed Suspension Tramway (Einschieniges Hängebahnsystem Eugen Langen).|$|R
5|$|Public {{transport}} systems in Mumbai include the Mumbai Suburban <b>Railway,</b> <b>Monorail,</b> Metro, Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) buses, black-and-yellow meter taxis, auto rickshaws and ferries. Suburban railway and BEST bus services together {{accounted for about}} 88% of the passenger traffic in 2008. Auto rickshaws are allowed to operate only in the suburban areas of Mumbai, while taxis are allowed to operate throughout Mumbai, but generally operate in South Mumbai. Taxis and rickshaws in Mumbai are {{required by law to}} run on compressed natural gas (CNG), and are a convenient, economical, and easily available means of transport.|$|R
2500|$|Metros, {{short for}} {{metropolitan}} railways, {{are defined by}} the International Association of Public Transport (L'Union Internationale des Transports Publics, or UITP) as urban guided transport systems [...] "operated on their own right of way and segregated from general road and pedestrian traffic. They are consequently designed for operations in tunnel, viaducts or on surface level but with physical separation {{in such a way}} that inadvertent access is not possible. In different parts of the world Metro systems are also known as the underground, the subway or the tube. Rail systems with specific construction issues operating on a segregated guideway (e.g. <b>monorail,</b> rack <b>railways)</b> are also treated as Metros as long as they are designated as part of the urban public transport network." [...] Metropolitan railways are used for high capacity public transportation. They can operate in trains of up to 10 cars, carrying 1800 passengers or more. In Germany, the terms U-Bahn and S-Bahn are used. Some metro systems run on rubber tires but are based on the same fixed-guideway principles as steel wheel systems.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: India is {{experiencing}} exceptional growth. India's population will be enormously 1. 523 billion by 2030. Due to over population, car ownership and personal vehicles lead to traffic congestion. To {{deal with such}} problems of moving {{large numbers of people}} and vehicle and air pollution (carbon emission) monorail be a good solution. It is relatively cheap to construct, also ideal for transporting people from a city's suburbs to its commercial districts and vice a versa. A <b>monorail</b> is a <b>railway</b> in which the track consists of a single rail, typically elevated. In this paper literature review is carried out of previous monorail projects and on monorail researches on Monorail Transportation System as an alternative mode of transportation, gives information about land use and public transportation planning and can have systematic approach and techniques to improve monorail project. The system is feasible for basic criteria Technically, Economically, safety and Ecofriendly...|$|R
5000|$|The Government of Tamil Nadu under DMK {{proposed}} a metro rail system for Coimbatore. However, in 2011, under ADMK government {{the plan was}} shelved in favour of a <b>monorail</b> system. Coimbatore <b>railway</b> struggle committee has also protested to implement metro rail project in Coimbatore In 2013,Metroman E. Sreedharan made survey and announced metro rail as suitable transport for Coimbatore.. In January 2017, a Coimbatore District Administration official told The Hindu {{that there was no}} mass rapid system presently under consideration for Coimbatore. Government again announced a plan to construct metro rail in 2017. Railway minister Suresh Prabu has announced that central government is ready to implement and fund metro rail project in Coimbatore. State government has also approved for metro rail. The works will began by next financial year 2017/18. CM Edapdi K Palaniswami announced metro rail plan for Coimbatore. He also announced that the feasibility study will be conducted and DPR will be prepared by CMRL and the funds will be provided by German based KFW company.|$|R
