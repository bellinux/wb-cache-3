40|$|Purpose To compare {{determinants}} for <b>medication</b> <b>errors</b> {{leading to}} patient harm with determinants for <b>medication</b> <b>errors</b> without patient harm. Methods A two-way case-control design {{was used to}} identify determinants for <b>medication</b> <b>errors</b> without harm (substudy I) and determinants for <b>medication</b> <b>errors</b> causing harm (substudy 2). Data of patients admitted to five internal medicine wards of two Dutch hospitals during 5 months were collected prospectively by chart review. <b>Medication</b> <b>errors</b> were detected and classified by two pharmacists. Consensus between five pharmacists was reached on the causal relationship between <b>medication</b> <b>errors</b> and patient harm. Data analysis was performed by multivariate logistic regression. Results We included 7286 medication orders, of which 3315 without errors (controls), and 5622 <b>medication</b> <b>errors</b> without harm (cases substudy 1) and 102 <b>medication</b> <b>errors</b> causing harm (cases substudy 2) were identified. Hospital, ward and the therapeutic class antiinfectives were associated with both <b>medication</b> <b>errors</b> without harm (hospital odds ratio (OR) 1. 40; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 21 - 1. 63), TweeSteden hospital (TSh) geriatrics OR 2. 03; 95 % CI 1. 73 - 2. 38, TSh general internal medicine OR 1. 44; 95 % CI 1. 23 - 1. 69 and antiinfectivcs OR 1. 28; 95 % CI 1. 06 - 1. 56) and <b>medication</b> <b>errors</b> with harm (hospital OR 4. 91; 95 % CI 3. 02 - 7. 79, TSh geriatrics OR 5. 76; 95 % CI 2. 52 - 13. 15, TSh general internal medicine OR 6. 51; 95 % CI 2. 82 - 15. 02 and anti-infectives OR 4. 20; 95 % CI 2. 24 - 7. 90).

[...] Handwritten reports or notes, manual order entry, non-standard abbreviations and poor legibility lead to errors and injuries to patients, [...] A follow up IOM report in 2001 advised use of electronic medication ordering, with computer- and internet-based information systems to support clinical decisions. Prescribing errors are the largest identified source of preventable hospital medical error. A 2006 report by the Institute of Medicine estimated that a hospitalized patient is exposed to a <b>medication</b> <b>error</b> each day {{of his or her}} stay. While further studies have estimated that CPOE implementation at all nonrural hospitals in the United States could prevent over 500,000 serious medication errors each year. Studies of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) has yielded evidence that suggests the <b>medication</b> <b>error</b> rate can be reduced by 80%, and errors that have potential for serious harm or death for patients can be reduced by 55%, and other studies have also suggested benefits. Further, in 2005, CMS and CDC released a report that showed only 41 percent of prophylactic antibacterials were correctly stopped within 24 hours of completed surgery. The researchers conducted an analysis over an eight-month period, implementing a CPOE system designed to stop the administration of prophylactic antibacterials. Results showed CPOE significantly improved timely discontinuation of antibacterials from 38.8 percent of surgeries to 55.7 percent in the intervention hospital. CPOE/e-Prescribing systems can provide automatic dosing alerts (for example, letting the user know that the dose is too high and thus dangerous) and interaction checking (for example, telling the user that 2 medicines ordered taken together can cause health problems). In this way, specialists in pharmacy informatics work with the medical and nursing staffs at hospitals to improve the safety and effectiveness of medication use by utilizing CPOE systems.|$|E

Despite ample evidence of the potential to reduce medication errors, competing systems of barcoding and electronic prescribing have slowed adoption of this technology by doctors and hospitals in the United States, due to concern with interoperability and compliance with future national standards. Such concerns are not inconsequential; standards for electronic prescribing for Medicare Part D conflict with regulations in many US states.And, aside from regulatory concerns, for the small-practice physician, utilizing CPOE requires a major change in practice work flow and an additional investment of time.

The analysis showed that <b>medication</b> <b>errors</b> that happen {{in the operating room}} or recovery areas are {{three times more likely to}} harm a patient than errors occurring in other types of hospital care. , this was the largest known analysis of medical errors related to surgery.|$|R
40|$|Background and Objective: The {{incidence}} of medical errors is deemed {{one of the}} unavoidable cases of serious threats {{to the health and}} safety of patients. This study aimed to determine the factors influencing <b>medication</b> <b>errors</b> from the perspective of the nursing staff.  Materials and Methods: This descriptive -analytic study recruited 80 nurses working in various wards in Fasa Hospital. The nurses were selected via the availability sampling method, and their perspective on factors affecting <b>medication</b> <b>errors</b> was gathered using a questionnaire designed for this study. The data were analyzed with SPSS- 15 software.    Results: The most important causes of <b>medication</b> <b>errors</b> were work fatigue, low nurse-to-patient ratio, long working hours, high density of work in units, and doing other tasks. Other variables such as age and gender as well as factors effective on the {{incidence of}} <b>medication</b> <b>errors</b> are mentioned in the full text.  Conclusion: From the nurses’ standpoint, workload and the patient-to-nurse ratio were the most significant factors leading to <b>medication</b> <b>errors...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this report is to describe the methods used in and lessons learned from a research study that evaluated prescriptions for <b>medication</b> <b>errors</b> prior {{to the implementation of}} an ambulatory computerized prescriber order entry (ACPOE) system in a community-based, integrated health system. Several aspects of the study are described: practice setting, research team, project scope and study design, data elements, database creation, data sources, study methods, evaluation methods, refinements, and current project status. Lessons learned are summarized. Focused attention to these aspects, a priori, resulted in the collection of data that have been used to characterize the epidemiology of <b>medication</b> <b>errors</b> at baseline. By repeating these same methods post-ACPOE implementation, the impact of the ACPOE system on <b>medication</b> <b>errors</b> will be determined. The methods used to measure the baseline rate of <b>medication</b> <b>errors</b> provided useful results and proved practical in a practitioner-based organization. This design can be replicated in similar organizations desiring to evaluate the impact of an ACPOE system on <b>medication</b> <b>errors...</b>|$|R
