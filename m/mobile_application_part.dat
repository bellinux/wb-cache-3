In realizing the intelligent network functionalities, databases {{play a major}} role. Currently proposed network architectures envision using the SS 7 -based signaling network for linking these DB's and also for interconnecting DB's with switches. If the network has to support ubiquitous, seamless mobile services, then it has to support additionally <b>mobile</b> <b>application</b> <b>parts,</b> viz., <b>mobile</b> origination calls, mobile destination calls, mobile location updates and inter-switch handovers.

40|$|<b>Mobile</b> <b>applications</b> build <b>part</b> {{of their}} {{security}} and privacy on a declarative permission model. In this approach <b>mobile</b> <b>applications,</b> {{to get access}} to sensitive resources, have to define the corresponding permissions in a manifest. However, <b>mobile</b> <b>applications</b> may request access to permissions that they do not require for their execution (over-privileges) and offer opportunities to malicious software to gain access to otherwise inaccessible resources. In this paper, we investigate on the declarative permissions model on which security and privacy services of Android rely upon. We propose a practical and efficient permission certification technique, in the direction of risk management assessment. We combine both runtime information and static analysis to profile <b>mobile</b> <b>applications</b> and identify if they are over-privileged or follow the least privilege principle. We demonstrate a transparent solution that neither requires modification to the underlying framework, nor access to the applications' original source code. We assess the effectiveness of our approach, using a randomly selected varied set of <b>mobile</b> <b>applications.</b> Results show that our approach can accurately identify whether an application is over-privileged or not, whilst at the same time guaranteeing the need of declaring specific permissions in the manifest.

50|$|The SS7 {{protocol}} stack may be partially mapped to the OSI Model of a packetized digital {{protocol stack}}.

Currently there are no protocol components that provide OSI layers 4 through 6. The Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP) is the primary SCCP User in the Core Network, using SCCP in connectionless mode. SCCP in connection oriented mode provides transport layer for air interface protocols such as BSSAP and RANAP.

SCCP completes the functions of the OSI network layer: end-to-end addressing and routing, connectionless messages (UDTs), and management services for users of the Network Service Part (NSP). Telephone User Part (TUP) is a link-by-link signaling system used to connect calls. ISUP is the key user part, providing a circuit-based protocol to establish, maintain, and end the connections for calls.

5000|$|Transmission {{of short}} {{messages}} between the SMSC and the handset is done whenever using the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Application</b> <b>Part</b> (MAP) of the SS7 protocol. [...] Messages are sent with the MAP MO- and MT-ForwardSM operations, whose payload length {{is limited by}} the constraints of the signaling protocol to precisely 140 bytes (140 bytes * 8 bits / byte = 1120 bits). Short messages can be encoded using a variety of alphabets: the default GSM 7-bit alphabet, the 8-bit data alphabet, and the 16-bit UCS-2 alphabet. Depending on which alphabet the subscriber has configured in the handset, this leads to the maximum individual short message sizes of 160 7-bit characters, 140 8-bit characters, or 70 16-bit characters. GSM 7-bit alphabet support is mandatory for GSM handsets and network elements, but characters in languages such as Arabic, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, or Cyrillic alphabet languages (e.g., Russian, Ukrainian, Serbian, Bulgarian, etc.) must be encoded using the 16-bit UCS-2 character encoding (see Unicode). Routing data and other metadata is additional to the payload size.|$|E
