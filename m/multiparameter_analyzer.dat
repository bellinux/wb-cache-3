40|$|A {{prototype}} of a multiparameter on-line analyzer for water pollution was constructed and {{tested in a}} sewage treatment plant and in a testing office on the river Elbe. A computer within the analyzer performs the instrument control, the recalibration, the processing of measuring data, connected with the analyzer for individual programming the analyzer and for a more comfortable data processing. Several different components are analyzed sequentially in one analyzer channel. The detection is made by a photometer (for instance for PO_ 4, NO_ 2) ore by ISE (for instance for NH_ 4, NO_ 3). During the long term field trial the <b>multiparameter</b> <b>analyzer</b> works reliably and with very litte maintenance requirements. The analyzer produces only minimal waste. Parameters determined by analyzer have differences of #+-# 2 [...] . 5 % to the laboratory analyzes. The measurement of NH_ 4 by ISE was disturbed by the high concentration of potassium in the river Elbe. (orig.)

40|$|Analog dynamic {{studies of}} the {{cerebral}} circulation performed with the scintillation camera and intrave nously injected n 9 mTc-pertechnetate provide infor mation on the vascularity of cerebral lesions and on the occlusion of major blood vessels (7). However, {{a large proportion of}} patients with clinical occlusive cerebrovascular disease have normal analog dynamic studies (2 - 4) suggesting that the technique is a relatively insensitive one. Limited success has been reported (5) for digital cerebral circulation studies. Attempts in this laboratory to improve the sensi tivity of cerebral dynamic studies by digital analysis have previously proved largely unsuccessful. Factors mitigating against success include (A) electronic noise in the data, (B) detector nonuniformity amount ing to a Â± 10 % variation in sensitivity from region to region of the gamma camera detector, (c) inac curacy and nonreproducibility of regions of interest selected &quot;by eyeball &quot; from the CRT display of a data terminal or <b>multiparameter</b> <b>analyzer,</b> and (D) inequality of region-of-interest area due to observer error, asymmetry of the patient's head, or rotation of the patient's head under the detector.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: This paper {{presents}} the failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) tool {{in a clinical}} laboratory through {{the introduction of new}} technology for blood gas and serum ionized calcium in multi-parameter analyzers such as Point of Care Testing (POCT). OBJECTIVE: To present FMEA as a tool for risk managing and improvement with the introduction of new technologies in a public laboratory. METHODS: The change of <b>multiparameter</b> gas <b>analyzer</b> type POCT was defined and described as a process. Subsequently, the criteria were presented to the risk assessment and its quantification. We studied the failure modes that might occur in this process. We established three action plans involving improvements {{to be made in the}} technological change. FMEA was applied in two stages: at the beginning of the project and after the implementation of the proposed measures. RESULTS: The first plan involved administrative measures related to the bidding process; the second preventive action involved the possibility of which supplier would win the bid by studying the efficiency of the analyzer and its impact on productivity; the third set of actions was directed to improvements in the relationship with the clinical staff in order to minimize occasional complaints. The last actions referred to employing new employees to meet the growing demand. CONCLUSION: FMEA proved to be a reliable tool for performance improvement, which proactively identifies, prioritizes and mitigates patient risks...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The Sysmex&# 174; XE- 2100 D is a <b>multiparameter</b> {{hematology}} <b>analyzer</b> {{designed for}} hematology testing in samples with {{ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid}} (EDTA). Objectives: Considering {{the importance of this}} hematology analyzer for clinical and laboratory practice, the objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate its analytical performance, comparing the obtained results with quality specifications described in literature. Material and method: In the evaluation of analytical performance, according to recommendations of the document H 26 -A 2 of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), intra-run imprecision, inter-run imprecision, linearity, carryover, autosampler evaluation, clinical sensitivity of the atypical lymphocytes flag (n = 400 samples) were included, as well as the comparison between automated and manual leukocyte differential count (n = 400 samples), based on an adaptation of the document H 20 -A 2 of CLSI. Results: Repeatability, reproducibility, linearity and carryover were satisfactory according to the manufacturer's specifications. The clinical sensitivity of the atypical lymphocytes flag showed efficiency, sensitivity and specificity of 92. 5 %, 65. 2 % and 94. 1 % respectively. The correlation coefficients between the automated and manual differential counts of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils were 0. 991, 0. 99, 0. 872, 0. 974 and 0. 557, respectively. Conclusions: The results were in accordance with quality specifications described in literature, indicating reliability in Sysmex&# 174; XE- 2100 D. This fact ensures certainty to both laboratory professionals and medical staff. We conclude that the Sysmex&# 174; XE- 2100 D showed excellent analytical performance, and is useful to provide reliable hematology data...|$|R

40|$|Two single-operator <b>multiparameter</b> {{metabolic}} <b>analyzers</b> (SOMMA) -coulometry systems (I and II) {{for total}} carbon dioxide (TCO 2) {{were placed on}} board the R/V Knorr for the US component of the Indian Ocean CO 2 Survey {{in conjunction with the}} World Ocean Circulation Experiment-WOCE Hydrographic Program (WHP). The systems were used by six different measurement groups on 10 WHP Cruises beginning in December 1994 and ending in January 1996. A total of 18, 828 individual samples were analyzed for TCO 2 during the survey. This paper assesses the analytical quality of these data and the effect of several key factors on instrument performance. Data quality is assessed from the accuracy and precision of certified reference material (CRM) analyses from three different CRM batches. The precision of the method was 1. 2 μmol/kg. The mean and standard deviation {{of the differences between the}} known TCO 2 for the CRM (certified value) and the CRM TCO 2 determined by SOMMA-coulometry were − 0. 91 ± 0. 58 (n= 470) and − 1. 01 ± 0. 44 (n= 513) μmol/kg for systems I and II, respectively, representing an accuracy of 0. 05 % for both systems. Measurements of TCO 2 made on 12 crossover stations during the survey agreed to within 3 μmol/kg with an overall mean and standard deviation of the differences of − 0. 78 ± 1. 74 μmol/kg (n= 600). The crossover results are therefore consistent with the precision of the CRM analyses. After 14 months of nearly continuous use, the accurate and the virtually identical performance statistics for the two systems indicate that the cooperative survey effort was extraordinarily successful and will yield a high quality data set capable of fulfilling the objectives of the survey...|$|R
