40|$|Deregulated {{reactive}} {{oxygen species}} (ROS) production {{can lead to the}} disruption of structural and functional integrity of cells as a consequence of reactive interaction between ROS and various biological components. Catalase (CAT) is a common enzyme existing in nearly all organisms exposed to oxygen, which decomposes harmful hydrogen peroxide, into water and oxygen. In this study, the full length sequence that encodes CAT-like protein from Spodoptera litura named siltCAT (GenBank accession number: JQ_ 663444) was cloned and characterized. Amino acid sequence alignment showed siltCAT shared relatively high conservation with other insect, especially the conserved residues which defined heme and NADPH orientation. Expression pattern analysis showed that siltCAT mRNA was mainly expressed in the fat body, midgut, cuticle and <b>malpighian</b> <b>tube,</b> and as well as over last instar larvae, pupa and adult stages. RNA interference was used to silence CAT gene in SL- 1 cells and the fourth-instar stage of S. litura larvae respectively. Our results provided evidence that CAT knockdown induced ROS generation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in SL- 1 cells. It also confirmed the decrease in survival rate because of increased ROS production in experimental groups injected with double-stranded RNA of CAT (dsCAT). This study implied that ROS scavenging by CAT is important for S. litura survival...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{brown planthopper}} (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens, {{is the most}} devastating rice pest in many areas {{throughout}} Asia. The reproductive system of female N. lugens consists {{of a pair of}} ovaries with 24 - 33 ovarioles per ovary in most individuals which determine its fecundity. The fork head (Fox) is a transcriptional regulatory molecule, which regulates and controls many physiological processes in eukaryotes. The Fox family has several subclasses and members, and several Fox factors have been reported to be involved in regulating fecundity. Results We have cloned a fork head gene in N. lugens. The full-length cDNA of Nl FoxA is 1789 bp and has an open reading frame of 1143 bp, encoding a protein of 380 amino acids. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) and Reverse Transcription- PCR (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that NlFoxA mRNA was mainly expressed in the fat body, midgut, cuticle and <b>Malpighian</b> <b>tube,</b> and was expressed continuously with little change during all the developmental stages. Nl FoxA belongs to the FoxA subfamily of the Fox transcription factors. Knockdown of NlFoxA expression by RNAi using artificial diet containing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) significantly decreased the number of offspring and impacted the development of ovaries. ELISA and Western blot analyses showed that feeding-based RNAi of NlFoxA gene also resulted in decreased expression of vitellogenin (Vg) protein. Conclusion Nl FoxA {{plays an important role in}} regulation of fecundity and development of ovaries in the BPH via regulating vitellogenin expression. </p...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{were made to}} determine the susceptibility of the females of two common mosquitoes, Anopheles sinensis and Aedes vexans nipponii, to the larvae of Dirofilaria immitis in Nagasaki City. In infected Anopheles sinensis the rate of microfilariae discharged in their droppings is rather high, but the mortality of the mosquitoes due to the infection is very low and {{a great part of}} the larvae entering the <b>Malpighian</b> <b>tubes</b> complete the development, and accordingly, the experimental infection rate with the mature larvae is considerably high. On the other hand, in Aedes vexans nipponii the rate of microfilariae discharged in droppings is low, but about a half of the larvae having entered the <b>Malpighian</b> <b>tubes</b> of the mosquitoes are killed {{in the early stages of}} the development, therefore the experimental infection rate with the mature larvae is considerably low. Moreover, when Ae, vex. nipponii had been fed on high-density microfilaria carriers, there was observed, in the first few days after infective feed, a high mortality of the mosquitoes due to the destruction of the <b>malpighian</b> <b>tubes</b> by the development of a great number of microfilariae...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to determine the susceptibility of the females of two common mosquitoes to the larvae of Dirofilaria immitis. In the both species, mean number of microfilariae taken up by a female mosquito when fed on an infected dog {{is about the same}} as the expected number. In Aedes albopictus the rate of filariae discharged in droppings of mosquitoes is very low. However, a great part of the larvae having entered the <b>Malpighian</b> <b>tubes</b> of the mosquitoes are killed {{in the early stages of}} the development, therefore the experimental infection rate with the mature larvae is not so high. On the other hand, in Culex pipiens molestus the rate of filariae discharged in droppings is very high, but a great part of the larvae entering the <b>Malpighian</b> <b>tubes</b> are completed the development, and accordingly, the experimental infection rate with the mature larvae is not so low...|$|R
40|$|Dengue virus {{serotype}} 2 (DENV- 2) RNA replication profiles and tropisms {{were studied}} by using quantitative RT-PCR (q-RTPCR) in intrathoracically infected Aedes albopictus. The virus RNA replication profiles were diverse in mosquito organs. In fat body, brain, salivary gland, and <b>malpighian</b> <b>tubes,</b> it peaked at 8, 23, 23, and 27 days post-infection, respectively, and then, all declined. In midgut, it increased {{all the time}} and had no trend of decline. In ovary, it had no apparent increase. Subsequent Western blotting of DENV- 2 E protein had similar results. Using ribosomal protein 7 (rpS 7) as an internal control, we found that, in salivary gland, brain, fat body, and midgut, the average DENV- 2 RNA levels (DENV- 2 RNA/rpS 7 mRNA) were 1, 028, 464, 5. 6, and 6. 2, respectively; in <b>malpighian</b> <b>tubes,</b> it was 1, and in ovary, it was far less than 1. These results suggest that infection profiles and tropism of DENV- 2 RNA in Ae. albopictus organs are significantly different...|$|R
40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) from {{nicotinamide}} adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases and their related dual oxidases are known to have significant roles in innate immunity and cell proliferation. In this study, the 5, 545 bp cDNA of the silkworm Bombyx mori dual oxidase (BmDuox) gene containing a full-length open reading frame was cloned. It was shown to include an N-terminal signal peptide consisting of 28 amino acid residues, a 240 bp 5 '-terminal untranslated region (5 '-UTR), an 802 bp 3 '-terminal region (3 '-UTR), which contains nine ATTTA motifs, and a 4, 503 bp open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 1, 500 amino acid residues. Structural analysis indicated that BmDuox contains a typical peroxidase domain at the N-terminus followed by a calcium-binding domain, a ferric-reducing domain, six transmembrane regions and binding domains for flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide}} (NAD). Transcriptional analysis revealed that BmDuox mRNA was expressed more highly in the head, testis and trachea compared to the midgut, hemocyte, <b>Malpighian</b> <b>tube,</b> ovary, fat bodies and silk glands. BmDuox mRNA was expressed during all the developmental stages of the silkworm. Subcellular localization revealed that BmDoux was present mainly in the periphery of the cells. Some cytoplasmic staining was detected, with rare signals in the nucleus. Expression of BmDuox was induced significantly in the larval midgut upon challenge by Escherichia coli and Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV). BmDuox-deleted larvae showed a marked increase in microbial proliferation in the midgut after ingestion of fluorescence-labeled bacteria compared to the control. We conclude that reducing BmDuox expression greatly increased the bacterial load, suggesting BmDuox has an important role in inhibiting microbial proliferation and the maintenance of homeostasis in the silkworm midgut...|$|E
40|$|An allele of the {{cytochrome}} P 450 gene, CYP 6 AE 14, named CYP 6 AE 25 (GenBank accession no. EU 807990) {{was isolated}} from the Asian com borer, Ostrinia fumacalis (Guenée) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) by RT-PCR. The cDNA sequence of CYP 6 AE 25 is 2315 bp in length and contains a 1569 nucleotides open reading frame encoding a putative protein with 523 amino acid residues and a predicted molecular weight of 59. 95 kDa and a theoretical pI of 8. 31. The putative protein contains the classic heme-binding sequence motif F××G×××C×G (residues 451 – 460) conserved among all P 450 enzymes {{as well as other}} characteristic motifs of all cytochrome P 450 s. It shares 52 % identity with the previously published sequence of CYP 6 AE 14 (GenBank accession no. DQ 986461) from Helicoverpa armigera. Phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences from members of various P 450 families indicated that CYP 6 AE 25 has a closer phylogenetic relationship with CYP 6 AE 14 and CYP 6 B 1 that are related to metabolism of plant allelochemicals, CYP 6 D 1 which is related to pyrethroid resistance and has a more distant relationship to CYP 302 A 1 and CYP 307 A 1 which are related to synthesis of the insect molting hormones. The expression level of the gene in the adults and immature stages of O. furnacalis by quantitative real-time PCR revealed that CYP 6 AE 25 was expressed in all life stages investigated. The mRNA expression level in 3 rd instar larvae was 12. 8 - and 2. 97 -fold higher than those in pupae and adults, respectively. The tissue specific expression level of CYP 6 AE 25 was in the order of midgut, <b>malpighian</b> <b>tube</b> and fatty body from high to low but was absent in ovary and brain. The analysis of the CYP 6 AB 25 gene using bioinformatic software is discussed...|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} the susceptibility {{of the females}} of four common mosquito species to the larvae of Dirofilaria immitis, laboratory experiments were mede in Nagasaki City. The number of microfilariae taken at the initial infective blood meal considerably differ by individual {{in all of the}} four species examined. In Aedes togoi the rate of filariae discharged in droppings of mosquitoes is the lowest and the experimental infection rate is the highest, and accordingly, this mosquito is probably the most susceptible species to the larvae of canine filaria among the four species examined. Culex pipiens pallens discharge filariae at the highest percentage, so that the experimental infection rate is not so high. In Culex tritaeniorhynchus summorosus the percentage dischage is high and the experimental infection rate is rather low. In Armigeres subalbatus the percentage discharge of filariae is rather low. However, the larvae entering the <b>Malpighian</b> <b>tubes</b> of the mosquito were all killed soon, therefore this mosqutio must be said to have no relation to the transmission of the disease...|$|R
40|$|Three {{strains of}} a trypanosomatid {{protozoan}} were {{isolated from the}} midguts of two naturally infected species of biting midges [Culicoides (Oecacta) festivipennis and Culicoides (Oecacta) truncorum] and characterized by light and electron microscopy and by molecular techniques. Morphological characteristics and sequences of the 18 S rRNA, 5 S rRNA, spliced leader RNA and glycosomal glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase genes indicate that the studied flagellates represent a novel phylogenetic lineage within the Trypanosomatidae. Based on phylogenetic analyses, the novel endosymbiont-free, monoxenous trypanosomatid was classified asSergeia podlipaevi gen. nov., sp. nov. Interestingly, it {{is closely related to}} another trypanosomatid species that parasitizes the sand fly Lutzomyia evansi, a blood-sucking dipteran from South America. The type strain of S. podlipaevi sp. nov., ICUL/CZ/ 2000 /CER 3, was obtained from <b>Malpighian</b> <b>tubes.</b> Of 2518 females of seven species of biting midges trapped in the Czech Republic, more than 1. 5 %were infected by trypanosomatid parasites.

40|$|THIS {{investigation}} into {{the activities of the}} gut in Tyroglyphus farinae Linn. was undertaken because so little is known of the physiology of the tyro-glyphid mites. The work was started in 1940 and has been continued as opportunity arose since then. It was hoped that the region of secretion of the digestive enzymes, together with the seat of carbohydrate and protein diges-tion and absorption, might be determined. Since the <b>Malpighian</b> <b>tubes</b> in the Tyroglyphidae (Acaridiae) are reduced or absent, it was hoped to find what region of the gut is responsible for the excretion of nitrogenous waste. An attempt was also made to identify the chief nitrogenous katabolites. METHODS Mites were cultured on food material stained with various indicators; by this means the pH of the gut was determined subject to protein error, and the passage of food was followed. Pig meal and bemax were found to be good culture media for this purpose. The cultures were kept in cells formed by fixing a glass ring on to a slide with gold size; they were covered by another slide held in position by a rubber band. The cells were kept in a dessicato...|$|R

40|$|The type of {{variegation}} of eyes of white-mottled mutants of D. hydei, either small-spotted or large-spotted, {{depends on}} the specific chromosome rearrangement involved. This distinction between mutants, though handsome, is not absolute because very seldomly small-spotted types do show a larger pigment aggregate and some "large-spotted" flies have no large spots at all, but only minor spots. Because of a pleiotropic action of the white gene, we could study the variegation of Malpighian tubules. The quasi-linear array of Malpighian cells enables a thorough statistical analysis. The problem was in how far the variegation of the tubes that is correlated with the variegation of eyes (in as far as numbers of pigmented and unpigmented cells are concerned) is also connected with a cell-lineage type of determination. Statistics now show {{that in spite of}} temperature-induced great variation in the percentage of pigmented cells, all types studied show a nearly random distribution of pigmented and unpigmented cells in the Malpighian tubules. This implies that the cell-lineage type of determination is not only largely mutant-specific but also organ-specific, i. e., limited to eyes. A basic gradient, however, as characteristic for eyes, was also found in <b>Malpighian</b> <b>tubes...</b>|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the tissue distribution of overproduced esterases A (A 1 and A 2) and B (B 1 and B 2) in strains of Culex pipiens L. by immunocytochemistry. S-LAB mosquitoes, lacking overproduced esterases, were used as reference. Tissues showing a strong specific reaction (fluorescence) were observed with anti-esterase A 1 antiserum in S 54 (with Al) and BOUAKE (with A 2) strains, and with anti-esterase BI antiserum in TEM-R and EDIT (with B 1) and BOUAKE (with B 2) strains. Overproduction of esterases A and B was tissue-specific. The most constant pattern for {{the two types of}} esterases was their overproduction in the alimentary canal and <b>Malpighian</b> <b>tubes,</b> although fluorescence varied in intensity depending on strains and developmental stages. There was no difference in the tissue distribution of esterases A 1 and A 2. In contrast, esterases B pattern was highly variable among strains. Differences between TEM-R and EDIT were explained by the different overall overproduction and number of copies of the amplified gene (10 -fold higher in TEM-R). The most striking difference in esterase BI and B 2 tissue localization concerned the nervous system where neurons were intensely fluorescent in TEM-R and EDIT (B 1), but not in BOUAKE (B 2). All esterase B positive tissues in TEM-R contained large quantities of esterase BI mRNA (in situ hybridization), indicating that {{at least part of the}} protein revealed by immunochemistry was produced in the tissues where it was observed. Our results are discussed in terms of the protection that the different esterases can confer during exposition to organophosphorous insecticides...|$|R
5000|$|The {{parasitic}} mites {{are either}} just {{visible to the}} naked eye or one needs a microscope to see them clearly. The distinct body segmentation characteristic of most arthropods is greatly reduced in the Acari. At the left of the diagram is an anterior section bearing the mouthparts (gnathosoma or capitulum), and at right, a posterior section comprising the main body (idiosoma). Mouthparts are characterized by a central pair of chelicerae, a ventral hypostome, and a lateral pair of palps. Chelicerae are protrusible, cutting or piercing structures essential to feeding. Palps are of sensory function during feeding and do not penetrate the host's skin. Acarines have no antennae and, except for some genera of ticks, are without eyes. A tube for ingesting food and secreting saliva is formed by apposition of both the chelicerae and the hypostome. The main body bears three pairs of legs in the larvae and four pairs in the nymphs and adults. The legs are multiple-jointed and operate by contraction of their internal muscles. The distal segment of the legs, the tarsus, is equipped with a terminal claw or pair of claws and sometimes with an adhesive pad or sucker that enables the mite to crawl up smooth surfaces. The internal organs (or viscera) include a tubular gut with a posterior anus, paired excretory <b>tubes</b> (<b>Malpighian</b> tubules) that empty out into the anus, paired respiratory tubes (tracheae) that carry atmospheric air directly up against the viscera, paired salivary glands with ducts to the mouthparts, female or male reproductive organs (ovary or testes), and a central nervous ganglion that acts as a simple brain.|$|R
