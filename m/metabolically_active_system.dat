40|$|Streptococci of Group A form long chains under {{a variety}} of conditions, the most {{interesting}} and useful of which is during growth in the presence of free homologous type-specific antibody. This phenomenon is the basis for a test for anti-streptococcal type-specific antibody, first described in 1957 (1), evaluated in 1959 (2), and improved and simplified in 1961 (3). The requirement for a <b>metabolically</b> <b>active</b> <b>system,</b> both for chaining and for subsequent dechaining, has been shown, but the manner by which type-specific antibody prevents dechaln]ng is uncertain. One interpretation is that the antigen-antibody reacdon somehow inhibits an enzymatic system which is otherwise continuously active in dechaining (4). Some general objections to this hypothesis {{as well as to the}} alternate one of polarized agglutination, have been given (3). The present studies are restricted to long chaining and dechaining in the presence of or after removal of, respectively, type-specific antibody. The data indicate that a form of end-to-end agglutination offers the simplest and most likely explanation for formation of long chains by Group A streptococci grown in the presence of homologous type-specific antibody...|$|E

MET-PET and contrast-enhanced MRI with Gd-DTPA were performed in 12 uniformly pretreated patients with recurrent GBM. To calculate the volumes in cubic centimetres, a threshold-based volume-of-interest (VOI) analysis of the <b>metabolically</b> <b>active</b> tumour volume (MET uptake indexes of > or = 1. 3 and > or = 1. 5) and of the area of Gd-DTPA enhancement was performed after coregistration of all images. In all patients, the <b>metabolically</b> <b>active</b> tumour volume as shown using a MET uptake index of > or = 1. 3 was larger than the volume of Gd-DTPA enhancement (30. 2 + or - 22. 4 vs. 13. 7 + or - 10. 6 cm(3); p = 0. 04). <b>Metabolically</b> <b>active</b> tumour volumes as shown using MET uptake indexes of > or = 1. 3 and > or = 1. 5 and the volumes of Gd-DTPA enhancement showed a positive correlation (r = 0. 76, p = 0. 003, for an index of > or = 1. 3, and r = 0. 74, p = 0. 005, for an index of > or = 1. 5).

For SIP, hatching larvae were fed with leaves from tobacco plants grown in a 13 CO 2 -enriched atmosphere. Dominant SSCP bands were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. Only one major gut colonizer, an Enterococcus relative, was detected; it occurred in the heavy RNA fraction, demonstrating its metabolic activity, and it originated from eggs, where its metabolic activity was also indicated by rRNA-based SSCP profiles. In contrast, a Citrobacter sedlakii relative was detected on eggs by DNA-SSCP, but rRNA-SSCP and SIP-rRNA-SSCP were negative, suggesting that these bacterial cells were inactive. A Burkholderia relative was dominant and <b>metabolically</b> <b>active</b> on the tobacco leaves but inactive inside the gut, where it was also quantitatively reduced, as suggested by lower band intensities in the DNA-based SSCP profiles. SIP-RNA-SSCP detected another <b>metabolically</b> <b>active</b> gut bacterium (Enterobacter sp.) and more bacteria in the light RNA fraction, indicating low or no metabolic activity of the latter inside the gut. We conclude that the larval gut supported only a low diversity of <b>metabolically</b> <b>active</b> bacteria...|$|R

40|$|Fusion {{positron}} emission and {{computed tomography}} (PET/CT) remains the gold-standard imaging modality to non-invasively study <b>metabolically</b> <b>active</b> brown adipose tissue (BAT).
