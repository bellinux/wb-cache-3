25|$|Simpson now {{announced}} that his target {{would be a}} run a minute, an ordinary rate <b>maybe</b> <b>in</b> days gone, but a breakneck almost in the sixties, what with slow over-rates and so much accent on defence.

I never remember seeing better running between wickets than of these two – and found myself comparing them, in fact, with Hobbs and Sutcliffe. With the field constantly changing over as right- and left-hander alternated, England, in much heat, sweated and chased unavailingly.|$|E

Then again, she could just be identifying herself alongside Einstein as a fellow genius.

[...] Anderson said that the decision to include Leon and other game characters in the film was [...] "fan-driven". Urb mentioned that he learned the video game Leon's mannerisms from watching clips posted on YouTube, commenting that [...] "he doesn't have a high-pitched voice. I feel like he talks how I naturally talk, which is kind of slower." [...] Speaking about the relationship between Leon and Ada, Urb said: [...] "It's kind of like Mulder and Scully and an X-Files type of deal, where you're waiting for it to happen, but it never does. <b>Maybe</b> <b>in</b> the next one, I'm hoping." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{the show}} aired, Ricky Gervais {{acknowledged}} {{that there were}} feelings of hesitation from certain viewers.

The New York Daily News called it [...] "so diluted there's little left but muddy water," [...] and USA Today called it a [...] "passable imitation of a miles-better BBC original." [...] A Guardian Unlimited review panned its lack of originality, stating, [...] "(Steve Carell) just seems to be trying too hard ... <b>Maybe</b> <b>in</b> later episodes when it deviates from Gervais and Merchant's script, he'll come into his own. But right now he's a pale imitation." [...] Tom Shales of the Washington Post said it was [...] "not the mishmash that [...] turned out to be, but again the quality of the original show causes the remake to look dim, like when the copying machine is just about to give out." ...|$|E

Edwards, Gordon, Ragan, Biffle, and Aric Almirola rounded out the first ten positions. Johnson, who was eleventh in the second session, could only manage 22nd. Following the third practice session, Harvick stated, [...] "We didn't put up a fast lap but it never slows down. I'm really excited." [...] Afterward, Johnson commented [...] "We struggled a little bit <b>maybe</b> <b>in</b> the first practice. But I found a good direction and started making some good gains there at the end.

500|$|As teenagers, the Gallagher {{brothers}} maintained limited {{contact with}} their father {{in order to secure}} jobs in construction. However, the relationship between father and sons continued to be tempestuous; Gallagher said that [...] "because we were always arguing we'd still be working at nine o'clock every night". Having left his father's building company, he took a job at another building firm sub-contracted to British Gas. There he sustained an injury when a heavy cap from a steel gas pipe landed on his right foot. Following a period of recuperation, Gallagher was offered a less physically demanding role in the company's storehouse, freeing up time for him to practise guitar and write songs. He claimed to have written at least three of the songs on Definitely <b>Maybe</b> <b>in</b> this storehouse (including [...] "Live Forever" [...] and [...] "Columbia"). He later called the storehouse [...] "The Hit Hut" [...] and claimed the walls were painted gold. Much of the late 1980s found Gallagher unemployed and living in a bedsit, occupying his time with recreational drug use, songwriting, and guitar playing. He is left-handed, but plays right-handed.|$|E
500|$|In Only You, Dick Daring!, his humorous yet damning {{account of}} the {{five and a half}} months he spent trying to make a show with CBS for the 1963–64 season based on an idea of Aubrey's about a county agent, writer Merle Miller {{described}} how Aubrey would simply walk out of meetings without offering any substantive comments on Miller's program and the nineteen rewrites he did of the pilot episode. Miller was assured by other CBS executives that Aubrey's silence meant things were fine– Kempton quoted a CBS producer telling Miller [...] "this {{has nothing to do with}} a good script or a bad script. It has to do with pleasing one man, Jim Aubrey. Don't ever forget it"– and Miller later learned of efforts by Aubrey to force him out. (A pilot for the show, known as Calhoun and County Agent, to star Jackie Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck, was shot and put on the fall schedule, but the series was canceled before it ever aired.) Miller quoted an independent producer: [...] "Aubrey's the most important man in television, in the history of television, <b>maybe</b> <b>in</b> the history of entertainment. He out-Mayers Louis B.

500|$|Đính was {{reported}} to have celebrated his new positions by making conspicuous appearances at Saigon nightclubs and dancing, having lifted Madame Nhu's bans on such activities.

500|$|Forster's {{performance}} at Arsenal on 2 February 2016 {{in his fourth}} match was highly impressive and drew plaudits from many. The Gunners dominated the match, and had 11 shots on target as opposed to Southampton's three. Forster pulled off a string of saves in what The Daily Telegraph described as a [...] "genuinely inspired goalkeeping performance". He saved twice from Mesut Özil in the first half, saving his first effort at goal with an outstretched leg then parrying his second shot, a volley from close range, away to safety. In the second half a shot from Alexis Sánchez was saved so spectacularly that Arsenal's Olivier Giroud was seen to turn towards Forster and applaud the save. A double save {{near the end of}} the match from Theo Walcott helped Southampton secure a hard fought 0–0 draw. After the match, Koeman praised his goalkeeper, hailing his performance as [...] "magic" [...] and describing him as [...] "one of the best goalkeepers in the Premier League and <b>maybe</b> <b>in</b> Europe". Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger also acknowledged Forster's showing, saying, [...] "He had a brilliant game." [...] Former Arsenal goalkeeper, Bob Wilson, added further praise: [...] "It was an exceptional goalkeeping display," [...] adding, [...] "Where I am admiring Fraser most is he has come back so well from a real long lay-off from a career-threatening injury... As regards who won Southampton the point it was Fraser without any doubt." ...|$|E
