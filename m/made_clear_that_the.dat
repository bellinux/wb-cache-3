5|$|The primary {{point of}} the Dictum was the {{re-establishment}} of royal authority. The Provisions of Oxford, that had been forced on the king, were repudiated, and it was <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> appointment of ministers was entirely a royal prerogative. King Henry in turn reconfirmed Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest. Measures were taken to renounce the increasing veneration of the fallen Simon de Montfort, whom some were already starting to consider a martyr and a possible saint.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{failed to}} {{recognize}} Lithuania as an independent state, and the Lithuanian delegation was not invited to the Brest-Litovsk negotiations that started on December 22, 1917, between the Central Powers and Russia in order to settle territorial claims. During the first and final official joint session between the Council and the German authorities, it was <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Council would serve only as an advisory board. This situation gave additional backing to those Council members who were seeking independence without any ties to other countries. The prime concern at this point was to invite back those members who had left the Council. Negotiations were undertaken {{that led to the}} reformulation of previous versions of the Act.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Corzine, and {{managers}} including Bradley Abelow and Henri Steenkamp, appealed a court ruling relating to repayments to customers of the bankrupt brokerage. A spokesman for Mr. Corzine <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> appeal {{was not an}} attempt to delay payments to customers, but due to a disagreement regarding how those claims would be handled by the trustee after they were paid. Mr. Corzine fully supported customers receiving 100 percent of their money and had no desire {{for this to be}} delayed. There was nothing preventing the trustee from making full distributions immediately and litigating the appeal after the fact. Ultimately all customers were paid in full.|$|E

5|$|The Court <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{interests}} of {{children should be}} assumed to be covered {{as part of the}} {{interests of}} the parent, not treated as separate, but this doctrine has been less clear in practice as termination proceedings still focus on the fitness of the parent. This has resulted in further constitutional protections for parents and increasingly formal termination proceedings that limit the contribution of the child's interests in the proceedings. Santosky has also contributed to the role of parental rights of undocumented immigrants as the constitutionally protected parental rights may apply to non-citizens as well as United States citizens.|$|E
5|$|Other public bills {{could no}} longer be vetoed; instead, they could be delayed for up to two years. This two-year period meant that {{legislation}} introduced in the fourth or fifth years of a parliament could be delayed until after the next election, which could prove an effective measure to prevent it being passed. Specifically, two years had to elapse between the second reading in the House of Commons in the first session and the passing of the bill in the House of Commons in the third session. The Speaker has to also certify that the conditions of the bill had been complied with. Significant restrictions on amendments are made to ensure that it is the same bill that has been rejected twice. The 1911 Act <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> life of a parliament could not be extended without the consent of the Lords.|$|E
5|$|The Act of February 16 {{proclaimed the}} {{re-establishment}} (atstatyti) of the Lithuanian state, {{making it the}} successor to the Lithuanian historical state, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In this respect the Council deviated from the resolution adopted by the Vilnius Conference which called for establishment (sudaryti) of a Lithuanian state. However, it was <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new state would be {{quite different from the}} old Duchy: it was to be organized only in ethnic Lithuanian lands (except for the Vilnius region which was majority Polish) and was to be governed by democratic principles, as opposed to the multi-ethnic Duchy that had been ruled by aristocracy. The termination of the ties binding Lithuania to other states was addressed to Germany, Russia, and Poland, all of which had their own plans for the country. Even though not addressed directly, the Act renounced any attempt to resurrect the former Polish-Lithuanian union.|$|E

5|$|On 1 May, HV {{launched}} Operation Flash and overran the ARSK-held part of Sector West in {{the course}} of few days. Šarinić warned Crabbe of the attack hours in advance to allow UNCRO troops to seek shelter. The RSK authorities said that some ARSK units were not able to remove antitank weapons from UNCRO depots in Stara Gradiška and near Pakrac until after the offensive began. These weapons had been stored there pursuant to the March 1994 ceasefire agreement. Nonetheless, UNCRO did not stop ARSK troops from retrieving the weapons. During the fighting, ARSK troops took 15 UNCIVPOL members, two interpreters, and 89 Nepalese and Argentinean troops hostage to use as human shields against the HV. HV troops hijacked an UNCRO armoured personnel carrier and a Land Rover to precede HV tanks that were moving west along the A3 motorway. On 3 May, the Argentinean battalion of UNCRO facilitated the surrender of 600 ARSK troops near Pakrac, following an agreement reached between Croatia and the RSK which was mediated by Yasushi Akashi, the personal representative of the UN Secretary-General. During Operation Flash, three Jordanian UNCRO troops were wounded by HV fire. The offensive <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> deployment of UNCRO would not deter further Croatian offensives.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys peninsulae {{was first}} {{collected}} in 1896 and Oldfield Thomas described it in 1897 {{as a full}} species of Oryzomys. It was retained as a distinct species related to O.couesi and O.palustris until 1971, when Philip Hershkovitz swept it, and other outlying populations {{of the same species}} group, as subspecies under an expanded concept of O.palustris. Raymond Hall concurred in the second edition (1981) of Mammals of North America, arguing that O.peninsulae differed less from mainland Oryzomys populations (currently classified as O.couesi mexicanus) than some other forms he included in O.palustris differed from each other. After studies of the contact zone between North American O.palustris and Central American O.couesi in southern Texas and northeastern Tamaulipas (by Benson and Gehlbach in 1979 and Schmidt and Engstrom in 1994) <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two are distinct from each other, O.peninsulae remained as a subspecies of O.couesi. In 2009, Michael Carleton and Joaquín Arroyo-Cabrales reviewed the classification of western Mexican Oryzomys and used morphological and morphometrical data to characterize four distinct Oryzomys species in the region. O.peninsulae and another isolated population, O.nelsoni from the Islas Marías, were both retained as separate species, as was O.albiventer from montane mainland Mexico. They kept the population in the coastal lowlands as a subspecies, O.couesi mexicanus, of Oryzomys couesi.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{original}} play contained three parts, they ran simultaneously {{so that the}} audience would experience {{a day in the}} life of Little, Chiron and Black concurrently.

25|$|In the sequels it is <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{language}} of the hrossa is the primary Old Solar language, and that the languages {{of the other two}} species are late derivatives of it.

In the essay Bluspels and Flalansferes: A Semantic Nightmare he argues that, though reason is the organ of truth, imagination is the organ of meaning.|$|E
25|$|The {{victory at}} Raban <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Byzantines were gaining {{the upper hand}} over the Hamdanids. Their success also enabled them to retain control of Samosata, meaning that they had broken through the {{fortified}} frontier zone protecting northern Syria. Nevertheless, the Hamdanid ruler was still in control of a potent military and capable of launching raids into Byzantine territory, until he suffered a catastrophic defeat in November 960 {{at the hands of}} Leo Phokas. Thereafter, Hamdanid military power was broken, Cilicia was annexed by the Byzantines in 964–965, and even Aleppo itself was captured briefly by the Byzantines in 962.|$|E

He also assured religious freedom to Muslims, Christians, Buddhists and others within this area. On the same accord, the separation of religion and politics was a part of this leaving religion as a matter of individual belief.

25|$|Indeed, the Empire {{now held}} several ambitious middle powers eager to gain at Austria's expense. Elector Augustus of Saxony was also King of Poland–Lithuania and could {{call on the}} {{resources}} of that realm to advance his interests in Germany. The Electorate of Hanover had gained tremendously through its personal union with Great Britain and could now draw on British power in German conflicts. Bavaria's strength was also waxing, as it asserted military and foreign policies ever more independent {{from those of the}} Empire.
