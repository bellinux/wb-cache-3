500|$|On July 14, 2013, {{before the}} World Championships in Moscow, it was {{announced}} that Gay had tested positive for a banned substance in May 2013.

[...] Adidas responded by suspending Gay's sponsorship contract with the sportswear manufacturer.

2500|$|The couplet offers {{resistance}} to the reader. The reader wants something like [...] "I thought out love an everlasting day / And yet <b>my</b> <b>trust</b> thou didst, my love, betray." [...] These lines fit {{the spirit of the}} poem. Reading the sonnet with the couplet that Shakespeare wrote leaves the reader uncomfortable. Heather Dubrow claims the speaker is trying to fool himself; he accepts a one moral from the metaphor, that the friend's betrayal is justified by the sun, and neglects the moral the reader has been observing, the friend, like the sun, has been deceptive.|$|E
2500|$|Religious imagery {{depicting}} the Sacred Heart is frequently featured in Roman Catholic, {{and sometimes in}} Anglican and Lutheran, homes. Sometimes images display beneath them a list of family members, indicating that the entire family is entrusted {{to the protection of}} Jesus in the Sacred Heart, from whom blessings on the home and the family members are sought. The prayer [...] "O Sacred Heart of Jesus, I place all <b>my</b> <b>trust</b> in Thee" [...] is often used. One particular image has been used as part of a set, along with an image of the Virgin Mary. In that image, Mary too was shown pointing to her Immaculate Heart. The dual images reflect an eternal binding of the two hearts.|$|E
