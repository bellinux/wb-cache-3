However, the Italian research in this case has seriously delayed and must now fill a knowledge gap substantially with respect to foreign realities. Exist in Italy and in particular for the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region,</b> the subject of this research, enormous sources of germplasm, but are still unexplored. The research project entitled "Improvement of turf in a Mediterranean environment: use of endemic species of plant and optimization techniques", otherwise known by the acronym Mi. TEA. Med., Funded by the Mi. P. A. A. F, provides for the collection and use of native species to the establishment of turfgrasses, with a twofold objective: the first, to study the behavior in the appropriate environmental conditions and use, and then enjoy the adaptability degree, from other things, examine the phenotypic variability level, in order to evaluate programs aimed at enhancing the materials of greater value, particularly respecting two important limitations: water resources and biodiversity, limiting the introduction of alien species...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for mapping the spatial distribution of natural habitats in the "Foothills of Larzac" Natura 2000 listed site located in a French <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Biogeographical</b> <b>Region.</b> Sparse Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis was used to analyze two RapidEye datasets (June 2009 and July 2010) {{with the purpose of}} choosing the most informative spectral, textural and thematic variables that allow discriminating the classes of habitats. The Sparse Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis selected relevant and stable variables for the discrimination of habitat classes that could be linked to ecological or biophysical characteristics. It also gave insight into the similarities and the differences between habitats classes with comparable physiognomic characteristics. The highest user accuracy was obtained for dry improved grasslands (u= 91. 97 %) followed by riparian ash woods (u= 88. 38 %). These results are very encouraging given that these two classes were identified in Annex 1 of the EC Habitats Directive as of community interest. Due to limited data input requirements and to its computational efficiency, the approach developed in this paper is a good alternative to other types of variable selection approaches in a supervised classification framework and can be easily transferred to other Natura 2000 sites...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: In {{the early}} 20 th century, two native North American poeciliid species Gambusia holbrooki and Gambusia affinis were {{introduced}} to Europe as a mosquito control agent. The first introduction to Istria from Italy in 1924 was followed by several independent introductions and massive translocations. Presently, the distribution of these two species in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosnia and Herzegovina) is still largely unknown and they are often confused. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the taxonomic status of individual Gambusia populations and to shed more light on the distribution and phylogeographic patterns of these invasive species in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Materials and Methods: All new and literature data were plotted together to obtain the overall distribution of Gambusia sp. in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The samples collected across this range were analysed meristically and by means of mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) gene sequence analysis to ascertain the true taxonomic status of the populations. For phylogeographic analysis, the cytb sequences from this study were combined with previously published data. Results and Conclusions: The methods only confirmed the presence of G. holbrooki. G. holbrooki is continuously distributed across the entire <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region</b> in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Two different mitochondrial cytb haplotypes were found: the widely spread Hol 1 haplotype and haplotype Hol 5 that in Europe was previously found only in France and Greece. This suggests that G. holbrooki populations in the region originated from different stocks...|$|E

40|$|Tree {{species with}} wide {{distributions}} often exhibit {{different levels of}} genetic structuring correlated to their environment. However, understanding how environmental heterogeneity influences genetic variation is difficult because the effects of gene flow, drift and selection are confounded. We investigated the genetic variation and its ecological correlates in a wind-pollinated Mediterranean tree species, Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl, within a recognised glacial refugium in Croatia. We sampled 11 populations from environmentally divergent habitats within the Continental and <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions.</b> We combined genetic data analyses based on nuclear microsatellite loci, multivariate statistics on environmental data and ecological niche modelling (ENM). We identified a geographic structure with a high genetic diversity and low differentiation in the Continental region, which contrasted with the significantly lower genetic diversity and higher population divergence in the Mediterranean region. The positive and significant correlation between environmental and genetic distances after controlling for geographic distance suggests an important influence of ecological divergence of the sites in shaping genetic variation. The ENM provided support for niche differentiation between the populations from the Continental and Mediterranean regions, suggesting that contemporary populations may represent two divergent ecotypes. Ecotype differentiation was also supported by multivariate environmental and genetic distance analyses. Our results suggest that despite extensive gene flow in continental areas, long-term stability of heterogeneous environments have likely promoted genetic divergence of ashes in this region and can explain the present-day genetic variation patterns of these ancient populations...|$|R
40|$|The Mediterranean basin, and the Iberian Peninsula in particular, {{represent}} an outstanding "hotspot" {{of biological diversity}} {{with a long history}} of integration between natural ecosystems and human activities. Using deductive distribution models, and considering both Spain and Portugal, we downscaled traditional range maps for terrestrial vertebrates (amphibians, breeding birds, mammals and reptiles) to the finest possible resolution with the data at hand, and we identified hotspots based on three criteria: i) species richness; ii) vulnerability, and iii) endemism. We also provided a first evaluation of the conservation status of biodiversity hotspots based on these three criteria considering both existing and proposed protected areas (i. e., Natura 2000). For the identification of hotspots, we used a method based on the cumulative distribution functions of species richness values. We found no clear surrogacy among the different types of hotspots in the Iberian Peninsula. The most important hotspots (considering all criteria) are located in the western and southwestern portions of the study area, in the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region.</b> Existing protected areas are not specifically concentrated in areas of high species richness, with only 5. 2 % of the hotspots of total richness being currently protected. The Natura 2000 network can potentially constitute an important baseline for protecting vertebrate diversity in the Iberian Peninsula although further improvements are needed. We suggest taking a step forward in conservation planning in the Mediterranean basin, explicitly considering the history of the region as well as its present environmental context. This would allow moving from traditional reserve networks (conservation focused on "patterns") to considerations about the "processes" that generated present biodiversity.

40|$|The ample {{distribution}} of common beech (Fagus sylvatica) across Europe implies that this key tree species occurs under a broad variety of climatic conditions despite its sensitivity to drought stress. Iberian beech rear-edge (southernmost) forests are located along {{the boundary between}} the Eurosiberian and Mediterranean biogeographical regions. Therefore, those forests are considered to be sensitive monitors of the effects of warming-induced drought stress on marginal tree populations. We evaluate if the radial growth of Iberian beech populations is mainly constrained by drought. Since previous findings indicated that El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) teleconnections may influence the rainfall regime in northern Spain, we also assessed if beech response to drought and water availability is modulated by this large-scale climatic pattern. We compared the recent growth patterns and responses to climate across a network of 30 tree-ring site chronologies established throughout northern Spain where beech forests are subjected to contrasting climatic conditions. Iberian beech populations located near or within the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region</b> were the most sensitive to June water deficit. However, the dependency of beech growth on drought stress near the rear-edge of the species was mitigated where cloudy conditions prevail in summer, namely in mesic stands located in the Eurosiberian region. Drought stress in the latter populations was alleviated by cloudiness, which in turn depended on ENSO, and this effect on growth has been intensifying for the last decades. We prove that the sensitivity of rear-edge populations to drought, in terms of growth reduction, is greatly modulated by local or regional environmental gradients, but also by the influence of large-scale climatic variation.

40|$|A Catalunya, en els últims 50 anys, s’ha produït una {{important}} transformació del paisatge agroforestal. Un cas molt interessant és el de la comarca de l’Alt Empordà, en què la superfície forestal ha augmentat un 12 %, en el període de 1957 a 2009. Això és producte de l’abandonament rural i la reducció de l’activitat forestal durant la segona meitat del segle XX, on el bosc i els matollars van anar envaint els conreus. Com a conseqüència d’aquest procés, el paisatge de la comarca s’ha homogeneïtzat, i s’ha incrementat el risc de grans incendis forestals. A més, el paisatge forestal de l’Alt Empordà continua transformant-se, ja que amb els escenaris de canvi climàtic es preveuen canvis en la distribució d’espècies forestals i l’augment d’incendis. Cal tenir presents aquests canvis per tal de millorar la gestió forestal, adaptar-nos al canvi climàtic i fer front als incendis, aconseguint mantenir la diversificació dels boscos naturals i l’estructura en mosaic en els terrenys agrícoles, pastures, herbassars i forestals que caracteritzen aquest entorn biogeogràfic mediterrani. The {{evolution of}} the forest landscape (1950 - 2013) in the Alt Empordà. In Catalonia in the last 50 {{years there has been}} a significant transformation of the landscape agroforestry. The region of Alt Empordà is a very interesting case, where the forest area has increased by 12 %in the period from 1957 to 2009. This is a product of rural abandonment occurred {{during the second half of}} the twentieth century. During this period the forest and the scrublands invaded the agricultural areas, as a product of the lack of forest exploitation and abandonment of crops. As a result of this process the landscape have been homogenized, and has increased the risk of fires. Looking to the future, the landscape of Alt Empordà are going to change more, because the climate change scenarios predict changes in the distribution of forest species and the increase of fires. It’s important to learn and understand these changes in order to improve forest management adapt to climate change and cope with fires, at the same time that we conserve a diverse natural forests, and themosaic patchwork landscape with pastures, farmlands, grassland, and forests, like the characteristic landscape of the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region...</b>|$|E
40|$|Summer {{water stress}} {{is the main}} {{limiting}} factor for Pinus pinaster growth under Mediterranean climate, but no information on limiting physiographic and climatic factors under Atlantic conditions is available for this species. We hypothesize that water availability during the active period limits P. pinaster growth, with stands nearby the Atlantic-Mediterranean boundary being more sensitive to summer drought stress. We analyzed the inter- and intra-annual climatic response of this species at ten monospecific stands in a transitional area between the Atlantic and <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> in Galicia, NW Spain. Mean sensitivity of radial growth consistently decreased with increasing elevation, and growth variation was quite similar for the earlywood, latewood or total ring widths, suggesting a strong intra-annual coherency of radial growth. Growth patterns were site dependent and geographically structured, with three groups of stands showing different climatic responses. As expected for sites suffering from summer drought stress, water availability enhances growth in western and southern Galicia, showing negative responses to maximum temperatures and positive to water availability. In northern Galicia, away from the Atlantic-Mediterranean boundary, water surplus in the rainy seasons negatively influenced growth. This was {{probably due to the}} combined effects of seasonal water-logging stress and the reduction of solar radiation associated with cloudiness, which would limit photosynthetic rates in winter and spring. Local variations of water availability strongly controlled the physiological processes that determine growth dynamics of P. pinaster in NW Spain, contributing to its geographical structure and contrasting sensitivity.

40|$|The {{ecological}} status of 203 amphibian aquatic breeding sites, {{selected from the}} national database of the Societas Herpetologica Italica (SHI), was surveyed in the period 2008 - 2009 to assess their {{ecological status}}.

The field surveys, conducted by professionals, amateurs and volunteers, showed that since 1979 about 11 % of the sites were destroyed or no more suitable for the reproduction of amphibians that bred in the same site in the past. The percentage of destroyed or altered sites was 8 %, both in the <b>Mediterranean</b> and Alpine <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions,</b> and 15 % in the Continental one.

40|$|Ecological {{features}} and conservation requirements of populations at the latitudinal limits of a species' geographical range frequently {{differ from those}} {{in other parts of}} the range. Identifying such differences is key to implementing effective conservation strategies for threatened range-edge populations especially, in the context of rapid global warming, at the lower-latitude range edge. We studied habitat selection and diet of the endangered Cantabrian Capercaillie Tetrao urogallus cantabricus in a recently discovered population at the southernmost edge of the sub-species' range. This is the only Western Capercaillie population in the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region.</b> We combined non-systematic surveys based on questionnaires, reports and field sampling with data from radiotracking to assess habitat selection. Diet was surveyed by micro-histological methods from droppings collected in the new population, which inhabits Pyrenean Oak Quercus pyrenaica forests and Scots Pine Pinus sylvestris plantations, and in two Cantabrian populations inhabiting Eurosiberian forests. Capercaillie preferred large (> 500 ha) and medium-sized (100 - 500 ha) Pyrenean Oak forest fragments and large Scots Pine plantations. Forest fragments smaller than 100 ha and non-forested habitats were always avoided. Diet differed markedly between Mediterranean and Eurosiberian populations. Bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus is common in the diet of most Capercaillie populations but was scarce in the study area and so was rare in the diet of the new population. Instead, Rockrose Halimium lasianthum was described for the first time as a major food resource for the Capercaillie and was consumed in autumn and winter. Pine needles were also heavily consumed in winter. We document for the first time the strong preference of Capercaillie for Pyrenean Oak forests and a moderately high consumption of the leaves, buds and acorns of this tree species throughout the year. Habitat selection and diet of this Mediterranean population differ from those of the core Cantabrian and other populations. Our results suggest a wider environmental tolerance (phenotypic plasticity) in the species than previously recognized. We advocate specific protection for this unique range-edge Capercaillie population and its Pyrenean Oak forest habitat.

40|$|From {{the point}} of view of plant life, the {{communities}} of recent coastal beaches and sand dunes (with ages inferior to 4000 years B. P.) are submitted to a stressful and harsh environment, generally characterized by incipient or inexistent pedogenetic evolution of the oligotrophic sands, weak water retention capacity and total absence of podzolization. In the <b>biogeographical</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Region</b> of the Portuguese coast, the climatic conditions are also severe. Major features are hot and long summers, short winters, low and concentrate precipitation patterns, weak incidence of aestival fogs, and increasing temperatures in the South. The unique spatial position of interface between the sea and land, and consequent environmental extreme conditions, result in original, sensitive, and valuable habitats, distributed along a well marked littoral-inland psammophilic gradient. This vegetation shows a notorious succession of segregated communities, (geopermasig-metum), that follows a clear geomorphological zonation (embryonic, primary and semi-stabilized dunes). The thermophilic conditions, the sea salt influence, the wind, the mobility of the sand, the waves action and the oligotrophic conditions, determine the occurrence of specific and highly adapted plant associations, confinedto that specific type of habitat, having few species in common with other terrestrial ecosystems.

40|$|Background: Italian forests {{contains}} a high total diversity of plants species {{and this is}} likely due to the huge biogeographical gradients covered by the country (from the Alps to the Mediterranean) {{as well as to}} the long lasting human exploitation and management practices. This study aims to investigate the interactive effects of ecology and biogeography in determining the total plant diversity of Italian forests using a spatially representative sample of forests made of 201 plots sampled all over the country (CONECOFOR LI network). The general hypothesis to be tested is that the effects of present day ecological factors are less important than biogeographical factors in determining the total diversity of forested areas. The plant diversity of the sampled forest plan communities was divided into different spatial components, in particular: plot, site, forest type (used as a proxy for present day ecological conditions) and <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region.</b> Species presence absence was only used.
