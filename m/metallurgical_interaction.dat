40|$|AbstractThe high {{temperature}} phase stability and metallurgical compatibility of Ferro boron alloy which contain about 15 wt. % boron and some impurity elements like C(0. 3),Si (0. 29), P(0. 006) etc, with 304 L SS {{have been evaluated}} using calorimetry and metallography. The X-ray diffraction of ferroboron revealed the presence of major FeB and minor Fe 2 B constituents, besides {{a small amount of}} Fe 3 (B, C). The thermal stability of this ferroboron alloy has been characterised up to melting by high resolution thermal analysis. In addition, the enthalpy increment measurements and hence specific heat estimates have been also made in the temperature range 400 - 1200 oC, using drop calorimetry. The {{high temperature}} <b>metallurgical</b> <b>interaction</b> between ferroboron and 304 L SS clad has been simulated at temperatures 823 – 1073 K (550 - 800 oC) for reaction times up to 5000 h, using diffusion couples...|$|E
40|$|A joining {{process was}} {{developed}} for fabricating lightweight, high temperature sandwich panels for aerospace applications using Ti- 14 Al- 21 Nb face sheets and Ti- 3 Al- 2. 5 V honeycomb core. The process, termed Enhanced Diffusion Bonding (EDB), relies on {{the formation of a}} eutectic liquid through solid-state diffusion at elevated temperatures and isothermal solidification to produce joints in thin-gage titanium and titanium aluminide structural components. A technique employing a maskant on the honeycomb core was developed which permitted electroplating a controlled amount of EDB material only on the edges of the honeycomb core in order to minimize the structural weight and <b>metallurgical</b> <b>interaction</b> effects. Metallurgical analyses were conducted to determine the interaction effects between the EDB materials and the constituents of the sandwich structure following EDB processing. The initial mechanical evaluation was conducted with butt joint specimens tested at temperatures from 1400 - 1700 F. Further mechanical evaluation was conducted with EDB sandwich specimens using flatwise tension tests at temperatures from 70 - 1100 F and edgewise compression tests at ambient temperature...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of a very small amount of Ga into Au contact metallization on InP is shown {{to have a significant}} effect on both the metallurgical and electrical behavior of that contact system. Ga atoms in the interstices of the Au lattice are shown to be effective in preventing the solid state reactions that normally take place between Au and InP during contact sintering. In addition to suppressing the <b>metallurgical</b> <b>interaction,</b> the presence of small amounts of Ga is shown to cause an order of magnitude reduction in the specific contact resistivity. Evidence is presented that the reactions of GaP and GaAs with Au contacts are also drastically affected by the presence of Ga. The sintering behavior of the Au-GaP and the Au-GaAs systems (as contrasted with that of the Au-InP system) is explained as due to the presence of interstitial Ga in the contact metallization. Finally the large, two-to-three order of magnitude drop in the contact resistance that occurs in the Au-InP system upon sintering at 400 degrees Centigrade is shown to be a result of the formation of an Au (sub 2) P (sub 3) layer at the metal-semiconductor interface. Contact resistivities in the 10 (sup - 6) ohm square centimeter range are obtained for as-deposited Au on InP when a thin (20 Angstrom) layer of Au (sub 2) P (sub 3) is introduced between the InP and the Au contacts...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrical}} and metallurgical {{behavior of the}} Ag-InP contact system has been investigated. Specific contact resistivity (Rc) values in the low 10 exp - 6 Ohm sq cm range are readily achieved on n-InP (Si: 1. 7 x 10 exp 18 /cu cm) after sintering at 400 C for several minutes. The low Rc values, however, are shown {{to be accompanied by}} dissolution of InP into the metallization, resulting in device degradation. An analysis of the sinter-induced <b>metallurgical</b> <b>interactions</b> shows this system to be similar to the well-characterized Au-InP system, albeit with fundamental differences. The similarities include the dissociative diffusion of In, the reaction-suppressing effect of SiO 2 capping, and especially, the formation of a phosphide layer at the metal-InP interface. The low post-sinter Rc values in the Ag-InP system {{may be due to the}} presence of a AgP 2 layer at the metal-InP interface; low values of Rc can be achieved without incurring device degrading <b>metallurgical</b> <b>interactions</b> by introducing a thin AgP 2 layer between the InP and the current carrying metallization...|$|R

40|$|Failure {{mechanisms}} due to <b>metallurgical</b> <b>interactions</b> {{have been}} investigated in commercially available AlGaAs/GaAs HEMTs and AlGaAs/InGaAs pseudomorphic HEMTs (PM-HEMTs) by means of accelerated tests at high temperature, with and without applied bias. In-depth Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) on device cross-sections and back-etching have been adopted as failure analysis techniques. Main reliability problems have been detected in Schottky gate and ohmic contacts due to thermally activated metal–metal and metal–semiconductor interdiffusion. After thermal storage, Al/Ti gate contacts show a decrease of barrier height with an activation energy Ea= 1. 3 eV, while the Al/Ni Schottky contacts shows an increase of barrier height with Ea= 1. 8 eV. An increase of source and drain parasitic resistance has been detected in devices of two suppliers with Ea= 1. 5 – 1. 6 eV. For both Schottky and ohmic degradation phenomena, the observed failure modes and mechanisms are not affected by {{the properties of the}} substrate structure, i. e. we did not observe, as far as <b>metallurgical</b> <b>interactions</b> were concerned, any difference between AlGaAs/GaAs and AlGaAs/InGaAs HEMTs. As a general result, our data show that recently manufactured HEMTs and PM-HEMTs can attain excellent levels of metallurgical stability even during very high temperature accelerated stress.

40|$|Bimetallic rolls {{used in the}} {{roughing}} {{stands of}} the Hot Strip Mill require mixed properties as a high wear resistance for the shell material and an enhanced toughness for the core material. The bimetallic roll studied in this paper is obtained from a vertical spin casting process followed by cooling and subsequent heat treatments. Failure of the compound roll sometimes occurs during the cooling stage of the casting route or later during the thermal treatments. It requires to deeply investigate the thermo mechanical <b>metallurgical</b> <b>interactions</b> generated during cooling and heat treatment {{in order to find}} the origin of cracks.

A blanket chemically vapor de-posited tungsten-plug technique involving an adhesion promoting layer of WSi., {{in combination with}} an aluminum track scheme is a very promising choice. Stability and <b>metallurgical</b> <b>interactions</b> of such a metallization system are of major concern. Many investigations {{have focused on the}} interface W/AI(Si, Ti), elucidating the barrier function of W against in-diffusion of A 1. Equivalent investigations regarding possible interfacial reactions of the triple-layer system W/WSiJAI(Si, Ti) are rare.

40|$|The recent {{development}} of 3 D-integrated electronic packages {{is characterized by}} the need to increase the diversity of functions and to miniaturize. Currently many 3 D-integration concepts are being developed and all of them demand new materials, new designs and new processing technologies. The combination of simulation and experimental investigation becomes increasingly accepted since simulations help to shorten the R&# 38;D cycle time and reduce costs. Numerical calculations like the Finite-Element-Method are strong tools to calculate stress conditions in electronic packages resulting from thermal strains due to the manufacturing process and environmental loads. It is essential for the application of numerical calculations that the material data is accurate and describes sufficiently the physical behaviour. The developed machine allows the measurement of time and temperature dependent micromechanical properties of solder joints. Solder joints, which are used to mechanica lly and electrically connect different packages, are physically measured as they leave the process. This allows accounting for process influences, which may change material properties. Additionally, joint sizes and <b>metallurgical</b> <b>interactions</b> between solder and under bump metallization can be respected by this particular measurement. The measurement allows the determination of material properties within a temperature range of 20 °C- 200 °C.

40|$|An {{extremely}} facile and novel method called spontaneous deposition, {{to deposit}} noble metal nanoparticles on a most stable form of carbon (C) i. e. diamond is presented. Nanometer sized particles of such metals as platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), gold (Au), copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) could be deposited on boron-doped (B-doped) polycrystalline diamond films grown on silicon (Si) substrates, by simply immersing the diamond/Si sample in hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution containing ions of the corresponding metal. The electrons for {{the reduction of}} metal ions came from the Si back substrate. The diamond/Si interfacial ohmic contact was of paramount importance to the observation of the spontaneous deposition process. The metal/diamond (M/C) surfaces were investigated using Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and x-ray diffractometry (XRD). The morphology (i. e. size and distribution) of metal nanoparticles deposits could be controlled by adjusting the metal ion concentration, HF concentration and deposition time. XRD data indicate the presence of textured and strained crystal lattices of Pd for different Pd/C morphologies, which seem to influence the electrocatalytic oxidation of formaldehyde (HCHO). The sensitivity of electrocatalytic reactions to surface crystal structure implies that M/C could be fabricated for specific electrocatalytic applications. The research also presents electroplating of Cu on ruthenium (Ru), which a priori is a promising barrier material for Cu interconnects in the sub 0. 13 μm generation integrated circuits (ICs). Cu plates on Ru with over 90 % efficiency. The electrochemical nucleation and growth studies using the potentiostatic current transient method showed a predominantly progressive nucleation of Cu on Ru. This was also supported by SEM imaging, which showed that continuous thin films of Cu (ca. 400 Å) with excellent conformity could be plated over Ru without dendrite formation. Scotch tape peel tests and SEM on Cu/Ru samples both at room temperature (RT) and after annealing at 800 oC, {{showed no sign of}} delamination of the Cu film from Ru indicating strong adhesion. XRD patterns from Cu/Ru samples at RT through 800 oC indicated Cu in its characteristic face centered cubic (fcc) form with (111) phase dominating. Most importantly no new XRD peak emerged, even after annealing to 800 oC showing Cu and Ru did not interact much. The excellent adhesion and lack of <b>metallurgical</b> <b>interactions</b> between Cu and Ru underscored the potential application of Ru as a new Cu diffusion barrier in the next generation ICs...|$|R
