25|$|The Western Railway {{between the}} capital Vienna and Salzburg is being upgraded. Most new {{sections}} have a continuous <b>maximum</b> <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> of 250km/h. German and Austrian ICE trains operate at a maximum speed of 230km/h, as do Austrian locomotive-hauled trains (called railjet) which were launched in 2008.|$|E
25|$|CRH1A, B,E, CRH2A, B,E, and CRH5A are {{designed}} for a maximum operating speed (MOR) of 200km/h and can reach up to 250km/h. CRH3C and CRH2C designs have an MOR of 300km/h, and can reach up to 350km/h, with a top testing speed more than 380km/h. However, issues such as cost of maintenance, comfort, and safety make the <b>maximum</b> <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> of more than 380km/h impractical and remain limiting factors.|$|E
25|$|Six fifth-batch 817-2000 series 2-car sets (V2001 to V2006) were {{delivered}} to Nōgata Depot from January 2012 for introduction on the Fukuhoku Yutaka Line {{from the start}} of the revised timetable on 17 March 2012. These sets have white-painted bodysides, and feature longitudinal seating to provide increased overall capacity and relieve overcrowding on the line. These sets feature interior LED lighting. They operate at a maximum speed of 100km/h, although they have a <b>maximum</b> <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> of 120km/h. A seventh set, V2007, was delivered in February 2013.|$|E
5000|$|She was {{propelled}} by three Yarrow-type water tube boilers powering Parsons geared steam turbines developing [...] and driving two screws for a <b>maximum</b> <b>designed</b> <b>speed</b> of 34 knots. She was oil-fired {{and had a}} bunkerage of 320 to 370 tons. This gave a range of 3,500 nautical miles at 15 knots.|$|R
50|$|She was {{propelled}} by three Yarrow water tube boilers powering Brown-Curtis geared steam turbines developing 27,000 SHP driving two screws for a <b>maximum</b> <b>designed</b> <b>speed</b> of 34 knots.

In the 1970s Amtrak operated both old-style steam-heated cars and new Amfleet cars with head-end power (HEP). GE designed two variants to handle these use cases: the E60CP had steam generators, while the E60CH had HEP generators. Both models had a cab and pantograph at each end. Reflecting the varied electrification schemes on the Northeast Corridor the Amtrak units could operate at three different voltages: 11 kV 25 Hz AC, 12.5 kV 60 Hz AC, and 25 kV 60 Hz. The wheels had a more standard diameter of [...]|$|E

2500|$|The [...] Brenner Base Tunnel under {{construction}} will allow speeds {{of up to}} 250km/h. The {{first part of the}} New Lower Inn Valley railway was opened in December 2012 as part of an upgrade of the line connecting the future Brenner Base Tunnel and southern Germany, which is being upgraded from two tracks to four and to a <b>maximum</b> <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> of 250km/h. The section is also part of the Berlin–Palermo railway axis.|$|E
50|$|A launch track {{serves the}} same basic purpose as a lift hill - {{providing}} power to the train - but accomplishes it {{in an entirely different}} manner. A lift hill gives the train potential energy by raising it to the highest point in the track (and not significantly accelerating it). A launch track gives the train kinetic energy by accelerating it to the <b>maximum</b> <b>designed</b> <b>speed</b> (while not significantly raising it).|$|R

2500|$|Five A380s {{were built}} for testing and {{demonstration}} purposes. The first A380 was unveiled {{at a ceremony}} in Toulouse on 18 January 2005, and its maiden flight took place on 27 April 2005. After successfully landing three hours and 54 minutes later, chief test pilot Jacques Rosay said flying the A380 had been [...] "like handling a bicycle". On 1 December 2005, the A380 achieved its <b>maximum</b> <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> of Mach 0.96. On 10 January 2006, the A380 made its first transatlantic flight to Medellín in Colombia.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is worth}} noting that [...] "saturation" [...] can only apply to a cluster of two or more CMGs, since it means that their rotor spins have become parallel. It is {{meaningless}} to say that a single constant-speed CMG can become saturated; in a sense it is [...] "permanently saturated" [...] in whatever direction the rotor happens to be pointing. This contrasts with a single reaction wheel, which can absorb more and more angular momentum along its fixed axis by spinning faster, until it reaches saturation at its <b>maximum</b> <b>design</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Vehicles with a {{top speed}} less than [...] (such as quads, low-end microcars, and agricultural/construction equipment) {{are not allowed to}} use the autobahn, nor are {{motorcycles}} and scooters with low engine capacity regardless of top speed (mainly applicable to mopeds which are typically limited to 25 or 45km/h anyway). To comply with this limit, heavy-duty trucks in Germany (e.g. mobile cranes, tank transporters etc.) often have a <b>maximum</b> <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> of [...] (usually denoted by a round black-on-white sign with [...] "62" [...] on it), along with flashing orange beacons to warn approaching cars that they are travelling slowly. There is no general minimum speed but drivers are not allowed to drive at an unnecessarily low speed as this would lead to significant traffic disturbance and an increased collision risk.|$|E

2500|$|The Atlantic Axis {{high-speed}} railway line is {{connecting the}} two main cities of Vigo and A Coruña (Corunna) via Santiago de Compostela in the northwestern Spanish region of Galicia. The railway, 155.6km in length, is an upgrade of the former non electrified single railway line between the town of Ferrol and the Portuguese border for the part between A Coruña and Vigo, into a double electrified high-speed line. The new rebuilt railway permits mixed use traffic with a <b>maximum</b> <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> of 250km/h for passenger trains. The new railway was inaugurated in April 2015 and shortened {{the distance between the}} two cities by 22km, from 178km to 156km, and cut the travel time from around 3 hours on the old railway down to 1 hour and 20 minutes on the new one. 37 tunnels totalling 59km and 34 bridges totalling 15km form part of the rebuilt railway. The line is served by Avant S-121 (max speed [...] ) train-sets for the routes between A Coruña and Vigo and between A Coruña and Ourense and by S-730 (Patito, max speed [...] ) train-sets for the Alvia services connecting Galicia with other Spanish regions. The line will be connected at Santiago de Compostela with the Madrid–Galicia high-speed rail line, which as of 2015 is under construction.|$|E
