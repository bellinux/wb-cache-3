40|$|AbstractAgricultural waste {{obtained}} from Elaeis guineensis <b>mid</b> <b>ribs</b> {{can provide a}} veritable source of materials {{which can be used}} as precursor materials for the production of pharmaceutical grade activated charcoal. The pore size and surface morphology of activated charcoal defines the types of molecules that could be adsorbed unto it, as surface morphology plays a significant role in determining the surface availability and areas of adsorption. The activated charcoal samples prepared from Elaeis guineensis via either physical or chemical activation was characterized via surface area using the BET method and subsequently pore structure and size analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Physically activated Elaeis guineensis fronds activated with nitrogen gas had wide spread microporosity with micropore volume of 0. 232 cc/g compared to the chemically activated with 1 M and 3 M phosphoric acid respectively. The commercial activated charcoal/metronidazole combination in the in vitro- pharmacodynamic model reflected no re-growth after 4 hours, however for charcoal formulated from Elaeis guineensis via chemical activation with 3 M phosphoric acid and metronidazole no regrowth was seen at the second hour and this was maintained throughout the duration of the experiment. Increased macroporosity enhanced bacterial adsorption and this was further facilitated by the presence of antibacterial metronidazole in the in vitro pharmacodynamic model. Activated charcoal produced from agricultural waste {{obtained from}} Elaeis guineensis dried <b>mid</b> <b>ribs</b> consisting of increased macroporosity with mixed meso/micro porosity and antibacterial metronidazole form the best model for bacterial adsorption and will be useful in the treatment of diarrhea caused by E. coli O 157 :H 7...|$|R

40|$|While 25 - 50 % {{of current}} {{pharmaceuticals}} {{are derived from}} plants, none are used as antimicrobials. Plants are rich {{in a wide variety}} of secondary metabolites such as tannins, terpenoids, alkaloids and flavonoids which have been found in-vitro to have antimicrobial properties. The objective of this project work was to evaluate the antibacterial effects of plants extract on human microbial pathogens. Antibacterial effects of plants extract are to determine the ability of plant part extract to kill or inhibit the growth of living bacterial cells. For this, the method generally used is Cylinder Plate Method or Cup Plate Method. The cylinder plate method is based upon diffusion of the plant extract from a vertical cylinder through a Solidify Agar layer in a petridish to an extent such that growth of the added microorganism is prevented entirely in a zone around the cylinder containing a extract of the plant.

5000|$|Irish stepdance is a {{style of}} {{performance}} dance with its roots in traditional Irish dance. It is generally characterized by a stiff upper body and quick and precise movements of the feet. It can be performed solo or in groups. Aside from public dance performances, there are also stepdance competitions all over the world. These competitions are often called [...] "Feis'" [...] which is short for Feiseanna. In Irish dance culture, Feisenna is a traditional Gaelic arts and culture festival. Costumes are considered important for stage presence in competition and performance Irish stepdance. In many cases, costumes are sold at high prices and can even be custom made. Males and females can both perform Irish stepdance {{but for the most}} part in today's society, the dance remains predominantly female. This means that the costumes are mainly dresses. Each dress is different, with varying colors and patterns, designed to attract the judge's eye in competitions and the audience's eye in performance. General appearance besides the costume is also equally important. Many dancers invest in curled wigs that match their hair color but add to the effect of a traditional Irish dancer. Poodle Socks are worn with the dresses and shoes. These are white socks that stretch to <b>mid</b> calf with <b>ribs</b> in them to keep the strings of the shoes tied up on the leg.|$|R

5000|$|Ascarina lucida, {{commonly}} known as hutu is a species of small tree in the family Chloranthaceae. It is endemic to New Zealand, being common on the West Coast and Nelson regions of the South Island and more rarely found in the North Island. [...] A typical plant association is within the Westland podocarp/broadleaf forests with common understory associates of Blechnum discolor, Pseudowintera colorata, Pseudopanax colensoi and Coprosma lucida. Most genus members are dioecious, producing unisexual male or female flowers on separate plants. Ascarina lucida, {{the only member of}} its genus to occur in New Zealand, is monoecious. It will grow to a height of 6m and can have a 30cm trunk. The leaves which are in opposite pairs are simple, yellowish green in color, have a raised <b>mid</b> <b>rib</b> and are very similar to Laurelia novae-zelandiae. Their margins have prominent teeth which are dark colored at the tips. Ascarina lucida is now nearly extinct in the Taranaki region but was last reported in Oct 1969 at Mt Taranaki, near Pukeiti by Colin Ogle.|$|E
50|$|The overall form of Veronica salicifolia can be {{described}} as “Willow like” due to its drooping appearance, hence the name New Zealand Willow. Unlike most Hebes that contain erect seeding structures, V. salicifolia have downward hanging capsules that disperse via gravity..Veronica salicifolia is a one of the larger Hebe species, its woody structure allows it to grow to around one to five meters tall and it can have quite a wide spread foliage. The narrow, oblong shaped leaves of V. salicifolia are oppositely arranged and are a dark to yellowish green colour, they also have hairs situated on the <b>mid</b> <b>rib</b> of the leaf. Multiple white and/or violet flowers can be found clustered together on stems that grow up to 24cm long. Veronica salicifolia {{is one of the few}} Hebes that have a pleasantly strong scent. They also produce a generous amount of nectar in comparison to other Hebes. Some of the less obvious structures that help distinguish V. salicifolia from other Hebes are its distinctive leaf buds, large nodules and shape and colour of its reproductive structures.For example the stamens are considered to be short and the anthers are violet in colour.|$|E
