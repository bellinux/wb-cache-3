5|$|Another {{issue that}} {{strained}} the UN logistics system {{was the lack}} of a previously drafted resupply plan. Consumption rates differed among the various units {{and as a result of}} a lack of coordination, some UN units faced supply shortages when other units would request <b>more</b> <b>material</b> than they actually needed. In order to rectify this situation UN logisticians were forced to hastily create a plan as the need arose.|$|E

5|$|Infrared {{emission}} {{also reveals}} {{the presence of}} un-ionised material such as molecular hydrogen (H2) and argon. In many planetary nebulae, molecular emission is greatest at larger distances from the star, where <b>more</b> <b>material</b> is un-ionised, but molecular hydrogen emission in NGC 6543 seems to be bright at the inner edge of its outer halo. This {{may be due to}} shock waves exciting the H2 as ejecta moving at different speeds collide. The overall appearance of the Cat's Eye Nebula in infrared (wavelengths 2–8μm) is similar in visible light.|$|E
5|$|James Neild {{visited the}} Marshalsea {{again during the}} first year of the new building's existence, {{publishing}} a description of it in 1812. This was supplemented by reports from the Committees and Commissioners on the State and Management of Prisons in London and Elsewhere, published between 1815 and 1818. <b>More</b> <b>material</b> is available in a pamphlet, An Expose of the Practice of the Palace, or Marshalsea Court, written in 1833 by an anonymous eyewitness.|$|E
5|$|Later, in 2001, the Campagne-sur-Aude {{site was}} {{explored}} again, {{this time by}} Gerard Chauvet, Jean-Luc Le Douarec, Colette Rives and Yvonne Vidoux.

The material all went to the Musee des Dinosaures, and together took about 10 years to assemble.|$|E

5|$|The TDRS-1 {{program was}} overall less successful, with the {{satellite}} suffering several computer failures and an overall loss of telemetry for several hours. In all, the orbiter {{was able to}} use the satellite for 65 of the planned 89 orbits, and could make successful use of the connection on about forty. The Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System equipment functioned as planned, processing several hundred times <b>more</b> <b>material</b> than would have been possible on Earth, and the Asahi Shimbun crystal experiment, flown for the second time, was able to produce snow crystals after the canister was redesigned.|$|E
5|$|The first {{remains were}} found in a bonebed {{discovered}} in 1989, which produced numerous ribs and vertebrae from the back and tail, {{as well as many}} limb bones, but no skull material aside from one tooth.

5|$|David and her editor Jill Norman had {{discussed}} such a book {{as early as}} the 1970s, but work on other projects precluded it. After David's death, Norman found when sorting out her papers that David had written and compiled far <b>more</b> <b>material</b> on a Christmas theme than anyone else had realised. Among the papers was an introduction that David had written for the projected volume, in which she said that one of her motives for writing a book about Christmas cooking was to head off the annual last-minute requests for recipes from her friends and relations. Those she had found most frequently asked for formed the core of the book. Together with some Christmas recipes from Mediterranean Food, French Provincial Cooking, and Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen, and revised articles published in previous years in magazines, they were turned into a 214-page book. The chapters dealt with the social and historical side of Christmas, first courses and cold meats, soups, poultry and game, meat, vegetables and salads, sauces, pickles and chutneys, and desserts, cakes and drinks.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Nolan {{designed}} the film's official website. As with the marketing strategy of The Blair Witch Project, the website {{was intended to}} provide further clues and hints to the story, while not providing any concrete information. After a short intro on the website, the viewer is shown a newspaper clipping detailing Leonard's murder of Teddy. Clicking on highlighted words in the article leads to <b>more</b> <b>material</b> describing the film, including Leonard's notes and photographs as well as police reports. The filmmakers employed another tactic by sending out Polaroid pictures to random people, depicting a bloody and shirtless Leonard pointing at an unmarked spot on his chest. Since Newmarket distributed the film themselves, Christopher Nolan edited the film's trailers himself. Sold to inexpensive cable-TV channels like Bravo and A, and websites such as Yahoo and MSN, the trailers were key to the film gaining widespread public notice.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-11 is a sunlike {{star in the}} {{constellation}} Cygnus that has a mass of 0.95 (± 0.1) Msun and a radius of 1.1 (± 0.1) Rsun. In other words, Kepler-11 is approximately 5% less massive and 10% wider than the Sun. The star's metallicity is 0 (± 0.1), meaning {{that the level of}} iron (and, presumably, other elements) in the star is almost {{the same as that of}} the Sun. Metallicity plays an important role in planetary systems, and stars with higher metallicity are more likely to have planets detected around them. This may be because the higher metallicity provides <b>more</b> <b>material</b> with which to quickly build planets into gas giants or because the higher metallicity increases planet migration towards the host star, making the planet easier to detect. The star has five other known planets in orbit: Kepler-11c, Kepler-11d, Kepler-11e, Kepler-11f, and Kepler-11g. The first five planets in the system are all able to fit within the orbit of planet Mercury, while Kepler-11g orbits further out.|$|E

5|$|Remains {{thought to}} belong to Nigersaurus were first {{discovered}} during a 1965–72 expedition to the Republic of Niger led by French paleontologist Philippe Taquet, and first mentioned in a paper published in 1976. Although a common genus, the dinosaur had been poorly known until <b>more</b> <b>material</b> of other individuals was discovered during expeditions led by American palaeontologist Paul Sereno in 1997 and 2000. The limited understanding of the genus {{was the result of}} poor preservation of its remains, which arises from the delicate and highly pneumatic construction of the skull and skeleton, in turn causing disarticulation of the fossils. Some of the skull fossils were so thin that a strong light beam was visible through them. Therefore, no intact skulls or articulated skeletons have been found, and these specimens represent the most complete known rebbachisaurid remains.|$|E
5|$|Rundgren {{had become}} {{confident}} enough at other instruments beyond his standard guitar and keyboards {{that he had}} tackled in earlier releases, and this, coupled with a general dissatisfaction with other studio musicians, led him to temporarily relocate to Los Angeles {{in an attempt to}} record an entire album single-handedly. After he had created significantly <b>more</b> <b>material</b> than would fit on a standard LP, an earthquake struck LA. He decided to head back to New York for some live sessions, with the help of Moogy Klingman, to lighten the mood. The final sessions were in Bearsville, where the remainder of the recording and mixing took place, and this created enough material for a double album.|$|E
5|$|The {{case is a}} tubular {{structure}} made of silk, secreted from salivary glands {{near the mouth of}} the larva, and is started soon after the egg hatches. Various reinforcements may be incorporated into its structure, the nature of the materials and design depending on the larva's genetic makeup; this means that caddifly larvae can be recognised by their cases down to family, and even genus level. The materials used include grains of sand, larger fragments of rock, bark, sticks, leaves, seeds and mollusc shells. These are neatly arranged and stuck onto the outer surface of the silken tube. As the larva grows, <b>more</b> <b>material</b> is added at the front, and the larva can turn round in the tube and trim the rear end so that it does not drag along the substrate.|$|E

5|$|Well {{before the}} design was finalised, four ships were ordered in July 1943. Africa was {{originally}} ordered as an unnamed Audacious-class carrier, but {{the order was}} modified to a Malta-class ship on 12 July 1943. Malta, New Zealand and Gibraltar were all ordered three days later. New Zealand was originally ordered from Cammell Laird, but the contract was transferred to Harland and Wolff on 22 July 1944. The Admiralty ordered Vickers not to order any <b>more</b> <b>material</b> on 27 April 1944 and given that final drawings were never issued to the builders, {{it is unlikely that}} any of them actually did more than preliminary work. None of the ships were ever laid down and all of them were cancelled before the end of 1945.|$|E
5|$|In 1876 the {{zoologist}} Joel Asaph Allen {{discovered the}} remains of Canis mississippiensis (Allen 1876) and associated these with C.dirus (Leidy 1858) and Canis indianensis (Leidy 1869). As so little was found of these three specimens, Allen thought it best to leave each specimen listed under its provisional name until <b>more</b> <b>material</b> could be found to reveal their relationship. In 1908 the paleontologist John Campbell Merriam began retrieving numerous fossilized bone fragments of a large wolf from the Rancho LaBrea tar pits. By 1912 {{he had found a}} skeleton sufficiently complete to be able to formally recognize these and the previously found specimens under the name C.dirus (Leidy 1858). Because the rules of nomenclature stipulated that the name of a species should be the oldest name ever applied to it, Merriam therefore selected the name of Leidy's 1858 specimen, C.dirus. In 1915 the paleontologist Edward Troxell indicated his agreement with Merriam when he declared C.indianensis a synonym of C.dirus. In 1918, after studying these fossils, Merriam proposed consolidating their names under the separate genus Aenocyon (from Aenos, terrible and cyon, wolf) to become Aenocyon dirus, but not everyone agreed with this extinct wolf being placed in a new genus separate from the genus Canis. Canis ayersi (Sellards 1916) and Aenocyon dirus (Merriam 1918) were recognized as synonyms of C.dirus by the paleontologist Ernest Lundelius in 1972. All of the above taxa were declared synonyms of C.dirus in 1979, according to the paleontologist Ronald M. Nowak.|$|E
5|$|Reviewing Patterson's and Thewissen's {{contributions}} in 1994, Ross MacPhee found little {{support for the}} classification of Plesiorycteropus as a tubulidentate in their data. MacPhee used a cladistic analysis of eutherians to ascertain the relationships of the genus, but found that while different analytic variants supported different affinities—with aardvarks, hyraxes, ungulates (hooved mammals), and even lipotyphlans (shrews, moles, hedgehogs, and allies)—there was no compelling evidence linking it to any other eutherian group. Therefore, he erected a separate order for Plesiorycteropus, named Bibymalagasia, arguing {{that it would be}} unacceptable to leave a Recent eutherian unassigned to any order and that discovery of <b>more</b> <b>material,</b> or further analysis, was unlikely to demonstrate close affinities of Plesiorycteropus with any other order. He considered it possible but unlikely that a few fossil taxa, such as Palaeorycteropus and Leptomanis from the Paleogene of France, would eventually be found to be bibymalagasians. Various analyses published by Robert Asher and colleagues in 2003, 2005, and 2007, based on morphology combined with DNA sequence data in some analyses, produced different estimates of the relationships of Plesiorycteropus, some placing it within Afrotheria close to aardvarks or Afrosoricida, but others supporting a relationship with the hedgehog Erinaceus. A 2004 morphological study by Inés Horovitz, focusing on extinct South American ungulates (such as Notoungulata and Litopterna), placed Plesiorycteropus among tubulidentates and closer to the extinct aardvark relative Myorycteropus than to Orycteropus. A 2013 study by Michael Buckley examined preserved collagen sequences in Plesiorycteropus bones. Buckley found that the animal was closely related to the tenrecs, a group of insectivorous mammals native to Madagascar, and suggested that it should be placed in the order Tenrecoidea with the tenrecs and golden moles.|$|E
