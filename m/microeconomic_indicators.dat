We use the seminal framework of Beck and Levine (2004) – {{both in terms of}} variables and econometric method – to estimate this causal relationship, independently from but controlling for the level of financial depth. Using a panel GMM with instrumental variables, our contribution involves testing how different measures of financial instability (an institutional index, <b>microeconomic</b> <b>indicators,</b> and our own statistical index derived from a principal component analysis) affect economic performance (or components of aggregate dynamics like consumption, investment and disposable income).

40|$|This paper aims at {{establishing}} {{the link between}} economic performance, financial depth and financial stability in the European Union from 1998 to 2011. We use the standard framework - {{both in terms of}} variables and econometric method - of Beck and Levine (2004) to estimate these relationships. Our results suggest that the traditional result that financial depth positively influences economic performance (or components of aggregate dynamics like consumption, investment or disposable income) is not confirmed for European countries. Furthermore, we use different measures of financial instability (institutional index, <b>microeconomic</b> <b>indicators,</b> and our own statistical index derived from a Principal Component Analysis) and find that financial instability has a negative effect on economic growth...|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} work {{deals with}} the issue of the effective taxation in the Czech Republic. The effective tax rate is an indicator measuring the tax burden. It takes into account not only the statutory tax rate but also different elements, which influence the tax base contained in legislation. The aim of this thesis is to compare effective tax rates in various industries in the Czech Republic for several consecutive years and define reasons and assumptions of their existence. The first two chapters are dedicated to the theoretical side of the issue by defining terms related to the effective tax and description of the methods. The third chapter explains the main differences between the statutory and effective tax rate. The fourth chapter, which is based on the calculated values of effective rates, is devoted to comparative analysis and explains the reasons of deviations. For the calculation of the tax rate was applied the <b>microeconomic</b> <b>indicator</b> real effective tax rate...|$|R
40|$|All tax {{indicator}} estimates, whether based on aggregate- or micro data, {{need to be}} corroborated by other information and preferably also other {{tax indicator}}s before policy conclusions can reasonably be drawn. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe the way the (macroeconomic implicit tax rate on labour income is calculated in the European Commission Structures of the Taxation Systems in the EU? publication, to show its relationship to the widely recognised (<b>microeconomic)</b> tax wedge <b>indicator</b> for an average production worker from the "Taxing Wages" approach of the OECD, and to illustrate its use. It appears from the European Commission report that evidence from the implicit tax ratio at the macro level in a single year cannot simply be projected to observations for an average worker at the micro level, and conversely. With a few exemptions, however, both the macroeconomic and the <b>microeconomic</b> <b>indicator</b> appear to have comparable informative content as regards to general increasing or decreasing trends over time. It should be noted that the changes in the macroeconomic implicit tax rate may reflect structural changes in the entire economy, such as changes in the distribution of wage income. The implicit tax rate relates to actual tax revenue data and it could be, for example, that the revenue effect of targeted reductions in personal income tax, at say, the lower end of the income scale, has been offset by increases in wage income at the top of the wage scale. The two indicators could then be considered complementary instruments for evaluating tax policy. European Union, Tax indicators, Effective tax rates, Taxes on labour, Non-wage labour costs...|$|R

The study employed both quantitative and qualitative research techniques. A semi-structured questionnaire was designed and distributed to firms in the phar-maceutical sector notably, manufacturers, wholesalers, prescription-only-medicine firms (POM) and over-the-counter shops (OTC). It was established that whereas an earlier study in 2001, found market orientation in the pharmaceutical industry in Ghana to be low (35 %), the current study found that due to improved <b>microeconomic</b> <b>indicators,</b> market orientation in the industry has grown significantly to over 50 %. The findings of the study also indicate a significant rela-tionship between market orientation and performance of firms in the pharmaceutical industry, and further indicate that, the practice of market orientation in the various categories of the sec-tor differs with an increase in size and organizational commitments of the firms involved.

40|$|AbstractThe {{opportunities}} for the enterprise financing depend on macroeconomic and <b>microeconomic</b> <b>indicators.</b> The enterprise life cycle has significant influence on financing of chosen development activities. Financing is one of key tasks in many enterprises. It is a process allowing the enterprise to survive or to progress. The aim of operative financing is to finane the enterprise current assets {{in order to maintain}} its constant run. It is realised in a form of short-term financing in most of cases but sometimes it has a form of middle-term financing. Operative cycles are important for enterprise because it influences the need of internal and external financial sources. Investment financing is related to long-term assets’ acquisition. Its aim is to fulfil the investment needs of enterprise in a form of spreading investments. State budget withdraws part of financial means of enterprises in a form of taxes and fees. The cash-flow category is used more frequently especially in financial analyses in evaluating the financial stability of enterprise and causes of changes of money sources in short-term planning of financial incomes and expenditures, in middle-term and long-term constitution of enterprise financial prognoses, in evaluating the investment variants effectiveness and as one of methods of defining the enterprise market value...|$|E

40|$|The {{difficulties}} {{experienced by}} firms and institutions during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) have considerably {{increased the number}} of corporate collapses and the analysis of the determinants of financial distress has attracted growing attention by researchers and practitioners. Prior to a corporate failure, the firm’s financial status is frequently in distress. Consequently, finding a method to predict corporate financial distress few step early is clearly a matter of considerable interest to investors, creditors, auditors and other stakeholders. The aim of the work is to propose a competing risk approach to analyse the determinants of the probability of different exit forms and investigate the differences in the factors driving firms to exit the market. The theoretical intuition has been supported by some empirical finding. In particular referring to a sample of Italian building firms, we consider different mutually exclusive business exit status i. e liquidation, bankruptcy and a third residual category that include firms that exit the market for any other reasons. The effect of <b>microeconomic</b> <b>indicators</b> and company-specific variables on these three states are examined. To this end, we develop a competing risk hazard model in order to identify the factors leading firms to exit the market and compare the predictive performance over single risk approach by means of same accuracy measure...|$|E

The <b>microeconomic</b> <b>indicators</b> of the Republic of Kazakhstan for the period from 2005 till 2012 are being analyzed; some conclusions and key takeaways on the reasons of changes in gross domestic product (GDP), the volume of production and investments are made. In connection with this the conditions for foundation and conduction of business on the territory of Kazakhstan as the basis of integration process are characterized. The integration of companies on the basis of merger and acquisition transactions (M and A) was examined as a special financial-economic tool. For deeper research we have made the review of professional literature which outlines the approaches to effective corporate governing {{in the sphere of}} business combination. The integration processes in the Republic of Kazakhstan are analyzed and the statistics on the state of economic concentration in the country for the period from 2007 till 2012 is given. The directions of liberalization of requirements for business integration at the legislative level which is caused by the openness of the borders of Kazakhstan economy for creation of alliances and joint companies on the basis of innovations are examined.

40|$|We review savings {{trends in}} Italy, {{summarizing}} available empirical evidence on Italians' motives to save, relying on macroeconomic indicators {{as well as}} on data drawn from the Bank of Italy's Survey of Household Income and Wealth from 1984 to 2004. The macroeconomic data indicate that households' saving has dropped significantly, although Italy continues to rank above most other countries in terms of saving. We then examine with <b>microeconomic</b> data four <b>indicators</b> of household financial conditions: the propensity to save, the proportion of households with negative savings, the proportion of households with debt, and the proportion of households that lack access to formal credit markets. By international comparison, the level of debt of Italian households and default risk are relatively low.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of bank interest spreads in Brazil reveal two stylized facts. First, a remarkable {{fall in the}} average rates since early 1999 and continuing up to the present. Second, a strong and persistent dispersion of rates across banks. Such stylized facts suggest that both the time series and the cross section dimensions are important elements to understand the trend of the bank interest spread in the country. This paper makes use of panel data techniques to uncover the main determinants of the bank interest spreads in Brazil. A question that the paper aims to address is whether macro or microeconomic factors are the most relevant ones affecting the {{behavior of}} such rates. A twostep approach due to Ho and Saunders (1981) is employed to measure the relative relevance of the micro and the macro elements. The roles played by the inflation rate, interest rate volatility, economic activity (all macroeconomic factors) and CAMEL-type <b>indicators</b> (<b>microeconomic</b> factors) are highlighted. The results suggest that macroeconomic variables are the most relevant factors to explain the behavior of bank interest spread in Brazil. JEL classification: G 21; E 43; E 44.

This analysis of the tax gap creates spaces for every interested party and to judge what brings consequences tax gap and what changes need to be made in the tax system a little bit to narrow this gap. One should note that any tax system throughout the world constantly facing the challenges of the tax gap as this is a negative phenomenon inherent in tax administration. A collaboration between policymakers and citizens would be the best solution and the most effective for reducing the tax gap. Creating a special mission in tax administration will serve as a model of good governance. Anyone who wants to contribute to maintaining the same level of tax gap or even worse attempt to increase his will help increase the tax burden on the taxpayers expenses honest. In this paper will be analyzed countries of the Balkan region. Discussion on the tax gap helps to focus attention on the events and lives of fiscal management that is a match with the culture face to face fiscal evasion and tax avoidance. This discussion should provide a light on the dilemma of tax administration, where efforts to promote voluntary compliance in the calculation and payment of taxes need to oppose strong measures to disarm those that do not apply the same principles of voluntary compliance. Tax gap can be assessed through two main models. The first model deals with <b>microeconomic</b> <b>indicators</b> approach or different model down – up. The second model which will apply and in this study has to do with the alignment of various macroeconomic indicators from top – down. Adapting the second model we can measure and evaluate the VAT gap and excise tax gap. But this approach has it...|$|E

Methodology includes publication research, interviews and practical comparison of the published statistic data and real production volume, returns and other indicators to be able to estimate actual potential of the target enterprises. The paper comes through the classical analytical methods showing their application pros and contras in highly corruptive environment with the strong trend of data falsification. Results of the survey show the basic economic methods applicable for the research activity of processing and manufacturing enterprises operating in the field of agriculture. The authors’ experience picks up the problem of the urgent need of new methodology among vast abstractive researching executed by the majority of the scientists as they have some contradictions when we apply them for the real industry segment or even an enterprise. Corruption affecting the general statistic data misrepresents the facts therefore current (classic methods) are not able to show real economic trends in the industrial segment. So the authors persist on the significance of the corruption distortion considering e. g. to identify the actual macro- and <b>microeconomic</b> <b>indicators,</b> indexes and ratios we involve the stage researching system of multidimensional comparative analysis to rank received rating and find appropriate position for enterprise and as we cannot ignore a constantly growing shadow sector of Ukrainian economy we perform economic potential assessment of the target enterprise with the identification of the shadow sector {{with the help of the}} offered in the paper formula. This set of the mentioned above tools allows us to estimate the influence of the inner and outer environment influence into the researchable object and show the actual phenomena trends. Another benefits of the offered ranking system is involving of several scientific approaches (every approach obtains its own pros and contras) so if they deal together we increase our accuracy. Practical implications. Ukraine has been being independent over a quarter of a century and unfortunately corruption has penetrated into each and every sphere of social and economic life including agriculture and due to the a great deal of fabricated data leading domestic scientist to study the macro- microeconomic state and processes mostly from the abstractive point of view. Therefore the methodology clarification and algorithm of the analytical method application estimate the target enterprises’ economic potential more accurate. Value/originality.

On the basis of research conducted abroad on bank and macroeconomic profitability indicators, in order to obtain research results the authors evaluated return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) indicators of the Latvian commercial banks. The authors conducted the survey of scientific literature and analyzed profitability indicators of commercial banks using descriptive methods, as well as SPSS data analysis methods, data correlation and regression analysis. On the basis of the obtained results, the authors have concluded that profitability has had a positive effect on operational efficiency, portfolio composition and management, while it has had a negative effect on the capital and credit risks, as measured according to ROA, while according to ROE, positive influence is exerted on composition of the capital portfolio and negative – on operational efficiency and credit risk. With regard to macroeconomic indicators, the authors have revealed that GDP has a positive impact on profitability as measured by ROA and ROE. The methodology used in the present research can be applied to determine not only profitability indicators of some commercial bank in particular, but also to compare performance indicators of several banks.
