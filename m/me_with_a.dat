5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge hit, that if someone came to <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> script, I would approach the result of the film before approaching the character. I only wanted to act in movies that were like Pokiri, I think that was a mistake. It all got to me and I felt that I needed a break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. I signed Khaleja after nine months, but it just kept getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't freak out... I relaxed {{for the first time in}} life.|$|E

25|$|In 1966, Kane {{retired from}} DC Comics, {{choosing}} {{to focus on}} fine art. As Kane's comic-book work tapered off in the 1960s, he parlayed his Batman status into minor celebrity. He enjoyed a post-comics career in TV animation, creating the characters Courageous Cat and Cool McCool, and as a painter showed his work in art galleries, although some of these paintings were produced by ghost artists. DC Comics named Kane in 1985 {{as one of the}} honorees in the company's 50th anniversary publication Fifty Who Made DC Great. In 1989, Kane published the autobiography Batman and <b>Me,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> second volume Batman and Me, The Saga Continues, in 1996.|$|E
25|$|Heirens's lawyers {{pressured}} {{him to take}} Tuohy's plea bargain. That deal, {{which was}} the topic of that closed-door meeting with Tuohy, stated that Heirens would serve one life sentence if he confessed to the murders of Josephine Ross, Frances Brown, and Suzanne Degnan. With {{the help of his}} lawyers, he began drafting a confession using the Chicago Tribune article as a guide:As it turned out, the Tribune article was very helpful, as it provided <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lot of details I didn't know. My attorneys rarely changed anything outright, but I could tell by their faces if I had made a mistake. Or they would say, 'Now, Bill, is that really the way it happened?' Then I would change my story because, obviously, it went against what was known (in the Tribune).|$|E

500|$|I was {{itching to}} move into drama and knew I had exactly the source {{material}} I wanted. I'd discovered M.R. James at boarding school and loved him.

The fact that period drama always has been very popular at the BBC probably helped.|$|E
500|$|In May 1982, Zappa {{released}} Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch, {{which featured}} his biggest selling single ever, the Grammy Award-nominated song [...] "Valley Girl" [...] (topping out at No.32 on the Billboard charts). In her improvised lyrics to the song, Zappa's daughter Moon Unit satirized the patois of teenage {{girls from the}} San Fernando Valley, which popularized many [...] "Valspeak" [...] expressions such as [...] "gag <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> spoon", [...] "fer sure, fer sure", [...] "grody to the max", and [...] "barf out".|$|E

500|$|In September that year, Dmowski's National Committee was {{recognized}} by the French as the legitimate government of Poland. The British and the Americans were less enthusiastic about Dmowski's National Committee, but likewise recognized it as Poland's government a year later. However, the Americans refused to provide backing for what they regarded as Dmowski's excessive territorial claims (Dmowski's Line). The American President Woodrow Wilson reported, [...] "I saw Mr. Dmowski and Mr. Paderewski in Washington, and I asked them to define Poland for me, as they understood it, and they presented <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> map in which they claimed {{a large part of}} the earth." ...|$|E
500|$|Ahimsa as {{an ethical}} concept evolved in Vedic texts. The oldest scripts, along with {{discussing}} ritual animal sacrifices, indirectly mention Ahimsa, {{but do not}} emphasise it. Over time, the Hindu scripts revise ritual practices {{and the concept of}} Ahimsa is increasingly refined and emphasised, ultimately Ahimsa becomes the concept that describes the highest virtue by the late Vedic era (about 500 BC). For example, hymn 10.22.25 in the Rig Veda uses the words Satya (truthfulness) and Ahimsa in a prayer to deity Indra; later, the Yajur Veda dated to be between 1000 BC and 600 BC, states, [...] "may all beings look at <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> friendly eye, may I do likewise, and may we look at each other with the eyes of a friend".|$|E

500|$|These skills, {{as well as}} his {{tastes and}} talents as a causeur, {{consolidated}} his reputation as an erudite in spite of his lack of formal studies. The cultivation of aesthetic goals had seemingly guided the writer throughout his life—the poet and mathematician Ion Barbu, who was one of Caragiale's greatest admirers, recounted with amazement that the writer would periodically visit the Romanian Academy's just to look over a certain page in a manual of arithmetics outlining the rule of three (he reportedly said to Barbu: [...] "Remembering its splendor provides <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> ceaseless drive to reread it"). At the same time, he was attracted by esotericism, alchemy and mystical subjects such as numerology, all of which form background elements in his prose.|$|E

[...] "Love Without Tragedy", blends 80s pop music and guitar with a [...] "modern and fresh" [...] reggae {{inspired}} melody. Rihanna is channeling the emotions caused by her assault from Chris Brown in which can be seen through the lines [...] "Felt love struck <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> knife/ I pray that love don't strike twice", and [...] "Who knew the course of this one drive injured us fatally?" ...|$|E
500|$|Mosley has {{described}} it as [...] "a lively type, underappreciated I think." [...] LTC's digitisation deliberately maintained its eccentricity and irregularity true to period printing, avoiding perfect verticals. In 1923, Morison at the British branch of Monotype thought it somewhat florid {{in comparison to the}} version of his branch which he considered a personal project, noting in a 1923 letter to American printer Daniel Berkeley Updike that [...] "I entertain very decided opinions about this latest of Mr. Goudy's achievements... a comparison leaves <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> preference for our version." [...] He added that he [...] "could not bring myself to believe" [...] that Garamond himself had cut the swash capitals that [...] "Mr. Goudy has done his best to reproduce".|$|E

500|$|South Indian {{actress and}} {{director}} Suhasini Maniratnam made her debut in Hindi cinema with Waiting; she {{was cast in}} the role of Pankaja, Shah's character's wife. Menon talked about her experience working with Suhasini saying, [...] "With her experience, she also helped <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> few difficult scenes behind the camera." [...] Arjun Mathur played the role of Rajat Deshpande, Tara's husband, who is involved in a car accident; Rajat Kapoor played Nirupam Malhotra, a doctor at the Kochi Hospital. Ratnabali Bhatachajee, Rajeev Ravindranathan and Marin Babu played supporting roles in the film. The rest of the film's supporting cast consisted mainly of Malayali actors, including Dinesh Nair and Krishna Sankar, who were signed up with assistance from Gautam Pisharody, a local casting agent.|$|E
500|$|... "The general discontent I {{felt with}} woman's portion as wife, housekeeper, physician, and spiritual guide, the chaotic {{conditions}} into which everything fell without her constant supervision, and the wearied, anxious {{look of the}} majority of women, impressed <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> strong feeling that some active measures should be taken to remedy the wrongs of society in general, and of women in particular. My experience at the World Anti-slavery Convention, all I had read of the legal status of women, and the oppression I saw everywhere, together swept across my soul, intensified now by many personal experiences. It seemed as if all the elements had conspired to impel me to some onward step. I could not see what to do or where to begin—my only thought was a public meeting for protest and discussion." ...|$|E
500|$|After the campaign, {{it emerged}} that Agnew {{had failed to}} report three alleged {{attempts}} to bribe him, made {{on behalf of the}} slot-machine industry, involving sums of $20,000, $75,000 and $200,000, if he would promise not to veto legislation keeping the machines legal in Southern Maryland. He justified his silence on the grounds that no actual offer had been made: [...] "Nobody sat down in front of <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> suitcase of money." [...] Agnew was also criticized over his part-ownership of land close to the site of a planned, but never-built second bridge over Chesapeake Bay. Opponents claimed a conflict of interest, since some of Agnew's partners in the venture were simultaneously involved in business deals with the county. Agnew denied any conflict or impropriety, saying that the property involved was outside Baltimore County and his jurisdiction. Nevertheless, he sold his interest.|$|E
