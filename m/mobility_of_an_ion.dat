40|$|High-field {{asymmetric}} waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) separates ions at {{atmospheric pressure}} {{based on the}} difference in the <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>ion</b> in a strong electric field and in a weak electric field. This field-dependent <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>ion</b> is reflected in the compensation voltage (CV) at which the ion is transmitted through FAIMS at an applied asymmetric waveform dispersion voltage (DV). In this report, we show that experimental CV peak shapes using dome tipped inner electrode FAIMS prototypes with inner/outer electrode radii of: (1) 0. 2 / 0. 4 cm and (2) 0. 4 / 0. 6 cm are a function of the longitudinal position of the inner electrode. Varying the longitudinal position of the inner electrode modifies the electric fields between the surfaces of the hemispherical shaped inner electrode and the outer electrode {{in the vicinity of the}} ion outlet. In this region the position-dependent electric field strength (E/N) effectively forms a second tandem FAIMS analyzer region having differing ion separation properties. The final tandem FAIMS separation is the intersection of the CV windows of these two differing FAIMS separations and, therefore, the peak width in the CV scan is dependent on the longitudinal tip displacement (LTD) of the inner electrode. CV scans are shown for a LTD range of 0. 14 to 0. 4 cm. These scans illustrate that it is possible to control the FAIMS resolution (CV/peak width) from about 1 for the 0. 2 / 0. 4 cm electrode set at intermediate longitudinal position to over 10 at the narrowest distance between the inner electrode and the ion outlet...|$|E
40|$|What {{determines the}} ionic {{conductivity}} of an electrolyte solution {{has remained a}} problem {{of great interest to}} chemists for more than a century. 1 - 3 Such long-standing interest stems not only from its relevance in many chemical and biological applications, but also from the many fascinating, often anomalous, behaviors that ionic conductivity exhibits in a large number of solvents. Most often discussed of these properties are the concentration and the nonmonotonic ion size dependencies. However, even after century-old debates and discussions, neither of the above two problems has been satisfactorily resolved. The <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>ion</b> in a polar solvent is determined by its complex interactions with the surrounding polar molecules; these interactions are long-ranged and anisotropic. In addition, the dynamics of polar liquids were very poorly understood until recently. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{determining}} separate ion concentrations using a conductivity sensor {{was developed and}} tested. While a single electrical conductivity measurement in a solution does not give information on the present ion types, a range of measurements at various electrolyte temperatures does. Since the temperature dependency of the <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>ion</b> is unique for that ion, {{it appeared to be}} possible to fit ion concentrations from a set of conductivity measurements while heating the electrolyte. For the calculation of the ion concentrations from conductivity vs. temperature sweep, an estimation algorithm is introduced based on the linear minimum mean square of the error. Errors in the measured conductivity will propagate through the algorithm into errors in the fitted ion concentrations. For the validation of the estimation method, this propagation of errors is also evaluated. The example given merely shows the feasibility of obtaining specific concentration information from an intrinsically non-specific type of measurement, electrolyte conductivity, by using the unique temperature dependence of ionic mobility...|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model {{to explain the}} observed <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> inorganic anions in capillary electrochromatography (CEC) using ion-exchange (IE) stationary phases has been derived. The model divides contributions to the observed <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> analyte <b>ion</b> into capillary electrophoretic (CE) and IE components. The CE component includes the influence of varying the ionic strength of the background electrolyte on the electrophoretic <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> the analyte, while the IE component accounts for the variation in retention of the analyte ion caused by changing {{the composition of the}} background electrolyte. The model was verified using <b>a</b> mixture <b>of</b> UV-absorbing inorganic ions in electrolytes of differing eluotropic strength in both packed and open-tubular CEC systems, with excellent agreement (r 2 > 0. 98) for both systems. Values of constants in the model equation determined by nonlinear regression were used to estimate the relative strengths of the interactions of different analytes with the stationary phase and these were found to agree well with elution orders observed in conventional IE chromatography...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we present a new, general but simple, {{microscopic}} expression for time-dependent solvation energy <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>ion.</b> This expression is surprisingly similar to the expression for the time-dependent dielectric friction on <b>a</b> moving <b>ion.</b> We show that both the Chandra-Bagchi and the Fried-Mukamel formulations of solvation dynamics can be easily derived from this expression. This expression leads to an almost perfect agreement of the theory with all the available computer simulation results. Second, we show {{here for the first}} time that the <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> light solute <b>ion</b> can significantly accelerate its own solvation, specially in the underdamped limit.

This field-dependent <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>ion</b> {{is reflected in the}} compensation voltage (CV) at which the ion is transmitted through FAIMS, at a given asymmetric waveform dispersion voltage (DV). Experimental CV, relative peak ion intensity, and peak width data were compared for three FAIMS prototypes with concentric cylindrical electrodes having inner/outer electrode radii of: (1) 0. 4 / 0. 6 cm, (2) 0. 8 / 1. 0 cm, and (3) 1. 2 / 1. 4 cm. The annular analyzer space was 0. 2 cm wide in each case. A finite-difference numerical computation method is described for evaluation of peak shapes and widths in a CV spectrum collected using cylindrical geometry FAIMS devices. Simulation of the radial distribution of the ion density in the FAIMS analyzer is based upon calculation of diffusion, electric fields, and the electric fields introduced by coulombic ion-ion repulsion. Excellent agreement between experimental and calculated peak shapes were obtained for electrodes of wide diameter and for ions transmitted at low CV...|$|E
40|$|Ion {{channels}} play pivotal {{roles in}} a wide variety of cellular functions; therefore, their physiological characteristics, pharmacological responses, and molecular structures have been extensively investigated. However, the <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>ion</b> channel itself in the cell membrane has not been examined in as much detail. A total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope allows fluorophores to be imaged in a restricted region within an evanescent field of less than 200  nm from the interface of the coverslip and plasma membrane in living cells. Thus the TIRF microscope is useful for selectively visualizing the plasmalemmal surface and subplasmalemmal zone. In this review, we focused on a single-molecule analysis of the dynamic movement of ion channels in the plasma membrane using TIRF microscopy. We also described two single-molecule imaging techniques under TIRF microscopy: fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) for the identification of molecules that interact with ion channels, and subunit counting for the determination of subunit stoichiometry in a functional channel. TIRF imaging can also be used to analyze spatiotemporal Ca 2 + events in the subplasmalemma. Single-molecule analyses of ion channels and localized Ca 2 + signals based on TIRF imaging provide beneficial pharmacological and physiological information concerning the functions of ion channels...|$|E
40|$|With {{the well}} {{established}} {{importance of the}} coupling of water and protons through electroosmotic drag in operating PEFCs the authors present here <b>a</b> derivation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mathematical model {{that focuses on the}} computation <b>of</b> the <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> hydronium <b>ion</b> through <b>an</b> arbitrary cylindrical pore <b>of</b> <b>a</b> PEM with a non-uniform charge distribution {{on the walls of the}} pore. The total Hamiltonian is derived for the hydronium ion as it moves through the hydrated pore and is effected by the net potential due to interaction with the solvent molecules and the pendant side chains. The corresponding probability density is derived through solution of the Liouville equation. This probability density is then used to compute the friction tensor for the hydronium ion. The authors find two types <b>of</b> contributions: (<b>a)</b> due to the solvent-ion interactions for which they adopt the conventional continuum model; (b) due to the interaction between the pendant charges and the hydronium ion.

40|$|The mixed ionic and {{electronic}} conducting fluorite and perovskite materials {{examined in this}} thesis are all oxide ion conducting materials. The defect chemistry and transport properties <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> these materials are measured using: 1) a measurement technique using an oxygen pump and an electrolyte probe; 2) coulometric titration; 3) standard techniques such as thermogravimetry, conductivity relaxation and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES). Models of the defect chemistry and oxygen permeation phenomena are used to interpret the measurements. The models are further used to predict the performance of oxygen separation membranes and fuel cells with mixed conducting materials. Electrolyte probe measurements revealed that the surface reaction rate constants <b>of</b> oxygen leaving <b>a</b> membrane (reduction) and oxygen entering the membrane (oxidation) of the investigated MIECs are the same. Both the oxide site reduced diffusion coefficient, analogous to the <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single <b>ion</b> vacancy, and the oxide site vacancy concentration were dependent on the chemical potential of oxygen and the temperature. Consequently, the dependencies of both parameters must be measured to predict the bulk transport. Slow transients in the MIEC samples altered the transport parameters of the mixed conductors {{over the course of}} days or weeks, especially when the membranes were partially reduced. According to model studies gadolinia doped ceria membranes are candidates for syngas production membranes. In many conditions gadolinia doped ceria furthermore performs better than conventional electrolyte membranes based on zirconia, especially when high power densities are required. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} has been {{developed}} to allow {{the determination of the}} halide anions chloride, bromide and iodide using isotachophoresis. This method employs a new electrolyte system which incorporates the novel application <b>of</b> indium(III) as <b>a</b> complexing agent.

The new procedure allows such separations to be made without interference from common inorganic anions such as sulfate and nitrate. Separations were performed using a miniaturised planar poly(methyl methacrylate) chip with integrated platinum wire conductivity detection electrodes. Using this instrumentation the limits of detection were calculated to be 0. 7 mg dm− 3, 1. 7 mg dm− 3 and 2. 2 mg dm− 3 for chloride, bromide and iodide respectively...|$|R

U posljednjih nekoliko desetljeća spektrometrija masa se sve češće rabi za dobivanje informacija o strukturi promatrane molekule. U ovom radu opisane su: ionska kromatografija, izmjena vodik/deuterij te kinetička metoda, tri najčešće primjenjivane tehnike za dobivanje informacija o sekundarnoj strukturi aminokiselina u plinskoj fazi. In {{the past}} two decades mass {{spectrometry}} became an important tool in the structural investigations of biomolecules (amino acids). Although, the primary focus of mass spectrometry is on compound identification and sequence information (primary structure), some mass spectrometry based methods as ion chromatography, hydrogen/deuterium exchange, and kinetic method are able to determine secondary gas phase structure of the amino acids. For example, it is possible to distinguish the zwitterionic and charge solvated structures of the sodiated amino acid, figure 1. Ion chromatography The ion chromatography (also <b>ion</b> <b>mobility)</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gas-phase <b>ion</b> is the quantity that describes how quickly the <b>ion</b> moves through <b>a</b> drift cell filled with a buffer gas under the influence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> weak electric field, figure 2. Basic setup for the ion mobility experiments is shown in figure 4. Measuring the mobility (collision cross section) <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>ion</b> yields information about its structure i. e. whether it is compact or extended. Based on this, some conclusions about gas phase structure of alkali cationized amino acids, are obtained. On the other hand some collision cross section data for ionic systems, obtained from the ion mobility experiments are often not conclusive when the shape of charge solvation is very similar to zwitterionic structures. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange In the typical hydrogen/deuterium experiment a cationized amino acid is exposed to gas phase of the deuterating reagent and the rate of the exchange is monitored by the mass spectrometer. The generally accepted mechanism for the hydrogen/deuterium exchange consists of three steps, scheme 1. The information obtained from site specific reaction rate coefficients can give information about the number of exchangeable hydrogens, location of the ionization site, location of the reactive groups, structure hydrogen bonding and shape of the cationized amino acid (zwitterionic versus charge solvated). On the basis of such information, results for protonated and sodiated proline are given in figures 5 and 6. Kinetic method The kinetic method is a procedure for the determination of thermochemical properties based on the rates of competitive dissociations of mass selected cluster ions. It is widely used for thermochemical and ion structural determinations. For example the kinetic method is used for determination of the most stable conformation of sodiated amino acids. Relative alkali metal ion affinities of amino acid and the corresponding methyl ester are determined. Based on the difference of sodium affinity between zwitterionic and charge solvated structures of the gas phase sodiated amino acids, some structural conclusions can be obtained...|$|R
