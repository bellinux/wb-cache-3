40|$|On {{the basis}} of the theoretic {{deduction}} and corresponding reasonable assumption, a mathematic model was built according to the flight model of exterior trajectory to improve the angular tracing precision of rotating <b>mirror</b> <b>house</b> in a streak camera. A test device was designed and developed for the angular tracing precision of rotating <b>mirror</b> <b>house</b> in the streak camera. The measuring principle of the test device was introduced, the angular tracing precision was measured by the developed device and the uncertainty factors of the tested device were analyzed. The tested results show that the angular tracing precision of the high speed rotating mirror in the streak camera is (0. 34 ± 0. 06) °, the relative uncertainty of the tested device is 3. 0 ″ and the main error sources come from interpretation and servo control. It concludes that the tested device designed has higher precision and reliability. © 2015, Science Press. All right reserved...|$|R

50|$|In 1976, {{to control}} the induced camera {{vibrations}} caused by the upward movement of the large mirror to a sudden stop, a mirror release mechanism was introduced. By sliding upwards the mirror-up switch on the right hand side of the <b>mirror</b> <b>housing,</b> it allowed a bypass of the mirror release from the shutter trip cycle. This allowed the mirror to fully raise and then hold, allowing then the shutter release cycle still be at the ready. Unfortunately, this also activated the main power switch that was mechanically tied to the mirrors' main gear action and until the depressing of the shutter release to completes the exposure, the power to the circuits remain on and would drain the battery over time. Even with this one negative aspect to the Mirror-Lock-Up modification, it would still become a standard feature in later productions.|$|E

50|$|The Pentax 6×7, {{designated}} product model number of 23400 by Asahi Pentax, {{is similar to}} any traditional 35mm SLR camera except in size. The hefty camera with a general dimension body of 7.25 inches × 4.5 inches × 3.75 inches / 18 cm × 11 cm × 9.5 cm and with the standard prism and 105 mm lens would bring it to 7.5 inches × 5.75 inches × 6.5inches / 18 cm × 14.5 cm × 17 cm. Users familiar with the diminutive cousins would find the Pentax 6×7 an easy transition due to {{the layout of the}} camera. Differing only in the location of the shutter speed knob as it is located on the left hand top. Location of the lens release is {{on the left side of}} the <b>mirror</b> <b>housing,</b> the shutter release and film advance lever are located on the right-hand side of the top. As naming conventions implies, the 6×7 indicates that this is a medium format camera and the negative produced is 6 cm by 7 cm (actual format 56mm X 70mm) and additionally the successors 67 and 67II remain the same format. The Pentax 6×7 has the ability to use either the 120 or 220 roll film, which produces ten or twenty respectively (twenty-one for the 1969 version). A small slotted selector on the right-hand side next under the film advance lever of the camera selects the film type (properly operated when film door is opened prior to selecting), and also the film pressure plate inside has positions for either type, the thickness of the films being different as it passes the 'main roller' towards the 'take-up' spool. The pressure plate also maintains film flatness in this horizontal design during exposure, aiding the extreme sharpness across the entire image for which the camera is renowned. Other systems use film tension alone, or against rails at the film's edge, in more compact vertical-feed magazines found in 6×6 or 6×4.5 formats. The synonymous or standard equipment includes the Super Takumar and later the Super-Multi-Coated TAKUMAR/6×7 1:2.4 f=105 lens and the pentaprism finder that allows for the 'through-the-lens actual image (90% of actual area) of what is being composed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the wake structure and the vortex body frame interaction near the real scale rear view mirror of a passenger car, the velocity vector fields in wake and pressure distribution over the mirror skin have been measured by use of the hot-wire anem-ometry and the pressure scanning system, respectively in the blow down wind tunnel at the Reynolds number of 5105. 2 ×. The boundary layer flow over the <b>mirror</b> <b>housing</b> and the mir-ror surface was visualized by the oil film technology as well. The vertical velocity vector fields to the main stream in the mirror wake showed that within the half distance of the mirror span the recirculation zone appeared and the intrinsic vortex was shed with the frequency of 19. 6 Hz, and also showed that a conical envelop of the vortex sheet was developed with its center trailing towards the body frame. The minimum pressure zone on the mirror surface appeared near the upper tip corner, {{which seemed to be}} the origin of the vortex envelop. The separation focus was found on the upper tip face of the <b>mirror</b> <b>housing</b> and a surface separa-tion line was also distributed over the edge line of the <b>mirror</b> <b>housing</b> in the visualization re-sults. Such flow characteristics of the single mirror were compared to those of the mounted mirror to the real scale car as well...|$|E
