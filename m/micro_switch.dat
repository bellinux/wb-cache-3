2500|$|A {{miniature}} snap-action switch, also trademarked {{and frequently}} {{known as a}} <b>micro</b> <b>switch,</b> is an electric switch that is actuated by very little physical force, {{through the use of}} a tipping-point mechanism, sometimes called an [...] "over-center" [...] mechanism. Common applications of micro switches include the door interlock on a microwave oven, levelling and safety switches in elevators, vending machines, and to detect paper jams or other faults in photocopiers. The miniature snap-action switch was invented in 1932 by Peter McGall, who was an employee of the Burgess Battery Company in Freeport, Illinois.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>micro</b> <b>switch</b> {{was invented}} by Phillip Kenneth McGall in 1932 in Freeport, Illinois, patent 1,960,020. McGall was an {{employee}} of the Burgess Battery Company at the time. In 1937 W.B. Schulte, McGall's employer, started the company <b>MICRO</b> <b>SWITCH.</b> The company and the <b>Micro</b> <b>Switch</b> trademark has been owned by Honeywell Sensing and Control since 1950. The trademark has become genericized for any snap-action switch. Companies other than Honeywell now manufacture miniature snap-action switches.|$|E

50|$|The {{joystick}} on {{both the}} Sega Master System and Nintendo Entertainment System versions uses <b>micro</b> <b>switches</b> in order to operate. <b>Micro</b> <b>switches</b> are no longer commonly used {{in the making of}} joysticks.

Modern devices of this kind more commonly use rubber, or occasionally foam feet.|$|R
50|$|<b>Micro</b> <b>switches</b> {{are very}} widely used; among their {{applications}} are appliances, machinery, industrial controls, vehicles, convertible tops {{and many other}} places for control of electrical circuits. They are usually rated to carry current in control circuits only, although some switches can be directly used to control small motors, solenoids, lamps, or other devices. Special low-force versions can sense coins in vending machines, or with a vane attached, air flow. <b>Micro</b> <b>switches</b> may be directly operated by a mechanism, or may be packaged {{as part of a}} pressure, flow, or temperature switch, operated by a sensing mechanism such as a Bourdon tube. In these latter applications, the repeatability of the actuator position when switching happens is essential for long-term accuracy. A motor driven cam (usually relatively slow-speed) and one or more <b>micro</b> <b>switches</b> form a timer mechanism. The snap-switch mechanism can be enclosed in a metal housing including actuating levers, plungers or rollers, forming a limit switch useful for control of machine tools or electrically-driven machinery.|$|R

5000|$|From {{a sample}} of the IED in question, Styles knew that the box {{containing}} the explosive would be booby-trapped, with <b>micro</b> <b>switches</b> at the top or bottom which would set off the bomb if the container was tilted or the lid removed, aiming to kill the bomb disposal experts. He built a mock-up of the bomb to work out his method. X-rays showed that the bomb contained approximately 15 lb of explosives. He and two colleagues took seven hours to disable its electrical circuits, after which the explosive was hauled onto the pavement outside the hotel and destroyed in a controlled explosion. Two days later, he was recalled to the same hotel to deal with a second bomb, this time containing 40 lb of explosives. Extra wiring, <b>micro</b> <b>switches,</b> and many redundant circuits had been added to confuse the bomb disposal experts. The second bomb took nine hours to disarm.

50|$|The {{defining}} {{feature of}} <b>micro</b> <b>switches</b> {{is that a}} relatively small movement at the actuator button produces a relatively large movement at the electrical contacts, which occurs at high speed (regardless {{of the speed of}} actuation). Most successful designs also exhibit hysteresis, meaning that a small reversal of the actuator is insufficient to reverse the contacts; there must be a significant movement in the opposite direction. Both of these characteristics help to achieve a clean and reliable interruption to the switched circuit.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{methods to}} exploit static and dynamic instabilities in electrostatic MEMS {{to develop new}} MEMS devices, namely dynamically actuated <b>micro</b> <b>switches</b> and binary <b>micro</b> gas sensors. Models are developed for the devices under consideration where the structures are treated as elastic continua. The electrostatic force is treated as a nonlinear function of displacement derived under the assumption of parallel-plate theorem. The Galerkin method is used to discretize the distributed-parameter models, thus reducing the governing partial differential equations into sets of nonlinear ordinary-differential equations. The shooting method is used to numerically solve those equations to obtain the frequency-response curves of those devices and the Floquet theory is used to investigate their stability. To develop the dynamically actuated <b>micro</b> <b>switches,</b> we investigate the response of microswitches {{to a combination of}} DC and AC excitations. We find that dynamically actuated <b>micro</b> <b>switches</b> can realize significant energy savings, up to 60 %, over comparable switches traditionally actuated by pure DC voltage. We devise two dynamic actuation methods: a fixed-frequency method and a shifted-frequency method. While the fixed-frequency method is simpler to implement, the shifted-frequency method can minimize the switching time to the same order as that realized using traditional DC actuation. We also introduce a parameter identification technique to estimate the switch geometrical and material properties, namely thickness, modulus of elasticity, and residual stress. We also develop a new detection technique for micro mass sensors that does not require any readout electronics. We use this method to develop static and dynamic binary mass sensors. The sensors are composed of a cantilever beam connected to a rigid plate at its free end and electrostatically coupled to an electrode underneath it. Two versions of micro mass sensors are presented: static binary mass sensor and dynamic binary mass sensor. Sensitivity analysis shows that the sensitivity of our static mass sensor represents an upper bound for the sensitivity of comparable statically detected inertial mass sensors. It also shows that the dynamic binary mass sensors is three orders of magnitude more sensitive than the static binary mass sensor. We equip our mass sensor with a polymer detector, doped Polyaniline, to realize a formaldehyde vapor sensor and demonstrate its functionality experimentally. We find that while the static binary gas sensor is simpler to realize than the dynamic binary gas sensor, it is more susceptible to external disturbances...|$|R
40|$|Electrodeposition {{processes}} were {{proposed for}} the fabrication of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) long time ago. Patterned layers of nickel, nickel alloys, gold alloys, silver and copper are used to realize <b>micro</b> <b>switches,</b> relays, valves, pumps, coils and gyroscopes. The metal layers have to meet the highest requirements on homogeneity, {{as well as on}} mechanical, electric or magnetic characteristics. The application of microelectroplating has to cope with specific effects influencing the electroplating conditions in the micrometer range. So, many efforts concentrate on the control and standardisation of microelectroplating processes. The suitability and application of electroplating methods will be exemplified by two concepts of a microrelay assigned for current loads of up to several amperes.

Based on Galerkin approximation, a single degree of freedom dynamic model is developed and limit-cycle solutions are calculated using the Finite Difference Method (FDM). In addition to the harmonic waveform signal, we apply novel actuation waveform signals to simulate the frequency-response. We show that, biased signals, using a square wave signal reduces significantly the pull-in voltage compared to the triangular and harmonic signal. Finally, these results are validated experimentally...|$|R

25|$|The six spoiler {{actuators}} {{were sent}} to the Royal Norwegian Air Force's facility at Kjeller for examination. Radiographic examinations confirmed that they were all in a closed and locked position. A simulation was carried out in a flight simulator to see if, given the conditions, a 146 could land at Sørstokken without operative spoilers. It concluded that this would be possible with a dry runway, but not if it is wet. An extensive investigation of the spoiler system was carried out by Aviation Engineering, who published their findings on 10 May 2011. AIBN quickly started working out from a hypothesis that the spoilers did not deploy and investigated three possible causes: a mechanical failure in the lever, a failure in two thrust lever <b>micro</b> <b>switches,</b> and an open circuit breaker in the lift spoiler system. In the latter it would have been necessary for two of four to fail, although one could have failed without being detected.|$|R
