The impact of these new procedures cannot be evaluated, however, until DOD has had a chance to apply its revised guidance to systems as they go through each acquisition decision milestone. DOD would then be able to demonstrate that the new procedures have (1) resulted in the review of relevant documents at each decision milestone to identify potential frequency problems, (2) prevented interference problems, and (3) improved the acquisition process. No DOD system had undergone the new procedures for all decision milestones at the time of GAO's review.

40|$|Distributed {{power has}} been a viable design {{approach}} for decades, albeit almost exclusively in the telecommunications domain. Board-mounted DC-DC converters, for example, were constructed with discrete components and used to convert power from a centralized supply to more usable power, typically at a backplane. Subsequently, the advent of high-density DC-DC converter modules paved the way to more widespread use of the idea in EDP, industrial, military and medical applications. Since that time, the chorus of articles in the trade press extolling the virtues of Distributed Power Architecture has been increasingly loud and clear: centralized architecture is going or gone and DPA is king. Wait a minute. A recent article 1 underscored the idea that power architectures don't exactly take the industry by storm.

40|$|The use of {{conventional}} tin-lead (SnPb) in circuit board manufacturing is under ever-increasing political scrutiny due to increasing regulations concerning lead. The "Restriction of Hazardous Substances" (RoHS) directive {{enacted by the}} European Union (EU) and a pact between the United States National Electronics Manufacturing Initiative (NEMI), Europe's Soldertec at Tin Technology Ltd. and the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA) are just two examples where worldwide legislative actions and partnerships/agreements are affecting the electronics industry. As a result, many global commercial-grade electronic component suppliers are initiating efforts to transition to lead-free (Pb-free) in order to retain their worldwide market. Pb-free components {{are likely to find}} their way into the inventory of aerospace or military assembly processes under current government acquisition reform initiatives. Inventories "contaminated" by Pb-free will result in increased risks associated with the manufacturing, product reliability, and subsequent repair of aerospace and <b>military</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>systems.</b> Although electronics for military and aerospace applications are not included in the RoHS legislation, engineers are beginning to find that the commercial industry's move towards RoHS compliance has affected their supply chain and changed their parts. Most parts suppliers plan to phase out their non-compliant, leaded production and many have already done so. As a result, the ability to find leaded components is getting harder and harder. Some buyers are now attempting to acquire the remaining SnPb inventory, if it's not already obsolete. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), depots, and support contractors {{have to be prepared to}} deal with an electronics supply chain that increasingly provides more and more parts with Pb-free finishes-some labeled no differently than their Pb counterparts-while at the same time providing the traditional Pb parts. The longer the transition period, the greater the likelihood of Pb-free parts inadvertently being mixed with Pb parts and ending up on what are supposed to be Pb systems. As a result, OEMs, depots, and support contractors need to take action now to either abate the influx of Pb-free parts, or accept it and deal with the likely interim consequences of reduced reliability due to a wide variety of matters, such as Pb contamination, high temperature incompatibility, and tin whiskering. Allowance of Pb-free components produces one of the greatest risks to the reliability of a weapon system. This is due to new and poorly understood failure mechanisms, as well as unknown long-term reliability. If the decision is made to consciously allow Pb-free solder and component finishes into SnPb electronics, additional effort (and cost) will be required to make the significant number of changes to drawings and task order procedures.

Although R&M {{technology has been}} developed primarily for <b>military</b> and <b>electronic</b> <b>systems,</b> the philosophies and methodolo-gies are applicable {{to the field of}} Fire Protection. To illustrate this, the reliability of a representative system for a high rise building is analyzed.

The results raise concern over the appreciable chance of failure of such systems. The case where only one back-up DG is used (typically) repre-sents a condition which is worse.

These include specification design requirements, fault detection, isolation, built-in test, automatic test equipment, and schemes utilizing Com-puter Management Systems for periodic exercise and monitoring of FP equipment.
