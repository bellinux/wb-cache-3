" STATE TRAFFIC DEATHS 1956 to date, 360; July, 60 1955 to date, 311; July, 48 "An Oklahoma City, insurance man met a fiery death Friday morning when his auto crashed into the engine of the Santa Fe's Texas Chief stream liner at the Memorial road crossing and burst into flames. The victim was identified as A. Poyntz Haskins, 58, of 1232 NE 16. His age was not determined immediately because his driver's license and clothing was charred by the burning wreckage like a giant blow torch. The fatal accident occurred at 9 : 48 a. m. at the Memorial road crossing west of U. S. 77 [...] once a "bloody" crossing until the automatic signal system was installed there five years ago. F. L. Tanner, signal maintainer for the Santa Fe at Edmond said it was the first fatality at the crossing since the signal system was installed. Trooper Bob Blackburn said Haskins was traveling west on Memorial road. He had just passed a cemetery and an outdoor sign advertising Baggerley funeral home when his auto skidded 75 feet and smashed into the fourth unit of a 4 -unit diesel engine pulling the Dallas section of the Texas Chief. Haskins' charred body was taken to Baggerley funeral home in Edmond. The impact hurled the auto into a <b>metal</b> <b>switch</b> box beside the track.

A series of PCMO films were prepared by pulsed laser deposition method on MgO and STO substrates. Characterizations of the structural, magnetic and magneto-transport properties show that the films prepared on MgO substrate contain higher amount of structural defects and with decreasing deposition temperature an increasing amount of difierent crystal orientations {{as the level of}} texturing decreases. According to the low field magnetoresistance (MR) measurements, the poorly textured samples display an increased low field MR due to a grain boundary tunneling effect at low temperatures compared to the fully textured PCMO film on STO substrate. However, in spite of the level of texturing, all the samples showed a colossal magnetoresistive insulator to <b>metal</b> <b>switching</b> of almost eight orders of magnitude at low temperatures. The magnetic field required for insulator to metal transition (IMT) is much higher in PCMO samples with more structural defects.

Microscale liquid <b>metal</b> <b>switches</b> are proposed to overcome the series loss, mechanical fatigue, and limited power handling reliability of common methods of antenna reconfiguration such as semiconductor diodes and microelectromechanical switches. The proposed microswitches consist of mercury droplets that selectively connect solid metal traces. Both fluidic and electrostatic switch actuation mechanisms are investigated, and an electrostatic switch is demonstrated. Electrostatically actuated switches are designed into a compact single-feed patch antenna configurable between two communication frequency bands and a GPS band with different circular polarizations. The antenna topology {{is based on a}} corner truncated square patch with switched sets of extensions to achieve resonant frequency and axial ratio control. Measurements of reconfigurable prototypes demonstrate frequency and polarization configurability in good agreement with full-wave simulations. The proposed reconfiguration mechanism is compared to other methods, and future directions for the integration of microfluidics in reconfigurable radio frequency systems are proposed. by Steven Christopher Yee.
