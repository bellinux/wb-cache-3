5|$|The two <b>main</b> <b>constituent</b> {{groups were}} the Allgemeine SS (General SS) and Waffen-SS (Armed SS). The Allgemeine SS was {{responsible}} for enforcing the racial policy of Nazi Germany and general policing, whereas the Waffen-SS consisted of combat units of troops within Nazi Germany's military. A third component of the SS, the SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS-TV), ran the concentration camps and extermination camps. Additional subdivisions of the SS included the Gestapo and the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) organizations. They were tasked with the detection of actual or potential enemies of the Nazi state, the neutralization of any opposition, policing the German people for their commitment to Nazi ideology, and providing domestic and foreign intelligence.|$|E
5|$|A {{snowflake}} is {{a single}} ice crystal that has achieved a sufficient size, and may have amalgamated with others, then falls through the Earth's atmosphere as snow. Each flake nucleates around a dust particle in supersaturated air masses by attracting supercooled cloud water droplets, which freeze and accrete in crystal form. Complex shapes emerge as the flake moves through differing temperature and humidity zones in the atmosphere, such that individual snowflakes differ in detail from one another, but may be categorized in eight broad classifications and at least 80 individual variants. The <b>main</b> <b>constituent</b> shapes for ice crystals, from which combinations may occur, are needle, column, plate and rime. Snowflakes appear white in color despite being made of clear ice. This is due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small crystal facets.|$|E
5|$|The {{amorphous}} form is {{an assortment}} of carbon atoms in a non-crystalline, irregular, glassy state, not held in a crystalline macrostructure. It is present as a powder, and is the <b>main</b> <b>constituent</b> of substances such as charcoal, lampblack (soot) and activated carbon. At normal pressures, carbon {{takes the form of}} graphite, in which each atom is bonded trigonally to three others in a plane composed of fused hexagonal rings, just like those in aromatic hydrocarbons. The resulting network is 2-dimensional, and the resulting flat sheets are stacked and loosely bonded through weak van der Waals forces. This gives graphite its softness and its cleaving properties (the sheets slip easily past one another). Because of the delocalization of one of the outer electrons of each atom to form a π-cloud, graphite conducts electricity, but only in the plane of each covalently bonded sheet. This results in a lower bulk electrical conductivity for carbon than for most metals. The delocalization also accounts for the energetic stability of graphite over diamond at room temperature.|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} of plant essential oils (EOs) in anticancer treatment has recently received many research efforts {{to overcome the}} development of multidrug resistance and their negative side effects. The aims of the current research are to study (i) the cytotoxic effect of the crude EO extracted from Origanum vulgare subsp hirtum and its <b>main</b> <b>constituents</b> (carvacrol, thymol, citral and limonene) on hepatocarcinoma HepG 2 and healthy human renal cells HEK 293; (ii) the antibacterial and phytotoxic activities of the above EO and its <b>main</b> <b>constituents.</b> Results showed that cell viability percentage of treated HepG 2 by EO and its <b>main</b> <b>constituents</b> was significantly decreased when compared to untreated cells. The calculated inhibition concentration (IC 50) values for HepG 2 were lower than healthy renal cells, indicating the sort of selectivity of the studied substances. Citral is not potentially recommended as an anticancer therapeutic agent, {{since there are no}} significant differences between IC 50 values against both tested cell lines. Results showed also that oregano EO and its <b>main</b> <b>constituents</b> have a significant antibacterial activity and a moderate phytotoxic effect. The current research verified that oregano EO and its <b>main</b> <b>constituents</b> could be potentially utilized as anticancer therapeutic agents...|$|R

5|$|Mimas, the {{innermost}} {{of the round}} moons of Saturn and directly interior to Enceladus, is a geologically dead body, even though it should experience stronger tidal forces than Enceladus. This apparent paradox can be explained in part by temperature-dependent properties of water ice (the <b>main</b> <b>constituent</b> of the interiors of Mimas and Enceladus). The tidal heating per unit mass is given by the formula , where ρ is the (mass) density of the satellite, n is its mean orbital motion, r is the satellite's radius, e is the orbital eccentricity of the satellite, μ is the shear modulus and Q is the dimensionless dissipation factor. For a same-temperature approximation, the expected value of qtid for Mimas is about 40 times that of Enceladus. However, the material parameters μ and Q are temperature dependent. At high temperatures (close to the melting point), μ and Q are low, so tidal heating is high. Modeling suggests that for Enceladus, both a 'basic' low-energy thermal state with little internal temperature gradient, and an 'excited' high-energy thermal state with a significant temperature gradient, and consequent convection (endogenic geologic activity), once established, would be stable. For Mimas, only a low-energy state {{is expected to be}} stable, despite its being closer to Saturn. So the model predicts a low-internal-temperature state for Mimas (values of μ and Q are high) but a possible higher-temperature state for Enceladus (values of μ and Q are low). Additional historical information is needed to explain how Enceladus first entered the high-energy state (e.g. more radiogenic heating or a more eccentric orbit in the past).|$|E

25|$|Fermentation {{of sugar}} into alcohol during {{winemaking}} always means that {{carbon dioxide is}} released. Carbon dioxide has the property of being very soluble in water (the <b>main</b> <b>constituent</b> of wine), a property that is utilized in sparkling wines. Production always starts from a base wine (where the carbon dioxide from the first fermentation has been gasified). In i.a. Champagne production the base wine is usually a blend of wines from different grape varieties and different wineries, where the distribution gives the final wine its special character, called cuvée. In some commonly used methods the base wine undergoes a secondary fermentation, which encloses the resulting carbon dioxide under excess pressure and binds it to the liquid in the sparkling wine. In this way the carbon dioxide content is created which, after opening the bottle, produces the bubbles. The dead yeast cells form a precipitate called lees, that often helps with appealing aromas to the sparkling wine but looks unappetizing. The lees is therefore normally removed before the wine is distributed.|$|E

Mutual reinforcement is one of the basic theories of traditional Chinese medicine. Here this article reviewed and analyzed the recent research on (1) How the <b>main</b> <b>constituents</b> of SHXXT impact on inflammation associated signaling pathway molecules. (2) The interaction between the <b>main</b> <b>constituents</b> and efflux pumps or intestinal transporters. The goal of this work was to, (1) Provide evidence to support the theory of mutual reinforcement. (2) Clarify the key targets of SHXXT and suggest which targets need further investigation. (3) Give advice for the clinical use of SHXXT to elevated the absorption of <b>main</b> <b>constituents</b> and eventually promote oral bioavailability. We search literatures in scientific databases with key words of "each main SHXXT constituent," in combination with "each main inflammatory pathway target molecule" or each main intestinal transporter, respectively. We report the effect of five <b>main</b> <b>constituents</b> on target molecules which lies in three main inflammatory signaling pathways, we as well investigate the interaction between constituents and intestinal transporter. We conclude, (1) The synergistic effect of constituents at both levels confirm the mutual reinforcement theory of TCM as it is proven in this work.
