5000|$|In {{dealing with}} {{humanitarian}} crises, emergency preparedness plays {{a critical role}} by building national capacity {{to reduce the cost}} of long-term response. For example, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) employs a <b>multisectoral</b> <b>approach</b> to help countries [...] "develop risk information to guide national and local policy; training and developing capacity for institutions, communities and first responders; reducing the risk of disasters in climatesensitive sectors; and helping planners integrate disaster riskreduction strategies into national development plans." [...] However, humanitarian finance is released after a crisis and instead of providing support through a continued preparedness system, isolated ‘preparedness activities’ take priority. Emergency preparedness is largely underfunded and existing financing is complicated, fragmented and disorganised. To better respond to humanitarian crises, a report by the Overseas Development Institute suggests that although there are advantages to improving existing financing mechanisms, incremental changes will still leave gaps and a new system must be considered to save lives and aid disaster risk reduction.|$|E

40|$|A recent Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) {{report states}} {{that climate change}} is unequivocal and its {{immediate}} impact is the modification of the worlds’ biophysical and natural systems resulting to changes in interspecies dynamics, movement of range, altered abundance, and shift in seasonal activities in various ecosystems. Agriculture will be the hardest hit sector globally as its productivity is primarily based on the integrity of agro-ecosystems. Adverse impacts to agriculture will have direct impacts on livelihoods, food security, and nutrition in rural areas. Climate resilient or smart agriculture (CRA/CSA), as a climate change response, provides an option for resource poor farmers in rural areas through its three- tiered objectives, which are: (a) increasing agriculture productivity and income in a sustainable, environmentally sound manner; (b) building capacity of households and food systems to adapt to climate change; and (c) reducing emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHG’s) while increasing carbon sequestration of agro-ecosystems. Healthy landscapes support food security, livelihoods, and ecosystem functions (helping build resilience). Global knowledge and experience on CRA/CSA is already vast. IIRR believes that its greater adoption by small-holder farmers, especially in the Philippine context, could be facilitated and accelerated, if and when, interventions are coordinated and done through community-based approaches.

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of non-communicable {{diseases such as}} hypertension and diabetes including obesity has increased {{over the past few}} years in Iran. The increase in these diseases has been associated with increased urbanization and lifestyle changes. The burden of non-communicable diseases (NCD) is increasing in low and middle-income countries. The aim of this report is to address the threat of NCDs in the capital city of 6 big provinces of Iran. Methods: A community based cross sectional study was carried out between March 2010 to January 2011 in 6 provinces' capital cities (Isfahan, Karaj, Mashad, Shiraz, Tabriz, and Tehran). Participants were men and women of 30 years and older who had been screened through the National Diabetes Prevention and Control Program. BMI, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose and lipids were measured. Results: 439406 cases (60 % female & 40 % male) were studied. The {{prevalence of}} pre-diabetes (13 %), diabetes (13 %), hypercholesterolemia (14 %), hypertension (11 %), overweight (27 %) and obesity (20 %) was higher than expected. Only 35 % of participants were healthy. Conclusion: This study reveals a high prevalence of NCDs in urban living population in those capital cities. It also shows that increasing urbanization may be an important threat to public health regarding NCDs especially in developing countries.

40|$|Worldwide, {{patterns}} {{of violence against}} women differ markedly from violence against men. For example, {{women are more likely}} than men to be sexually assaulted or killed by someone they know. The United Nations has defined violence against women as"gender-based"violence, to acknowledge that such violence is rooted in gender inequality and is often tolerated and condoned by laws, institutions, and community norms. Violence against women is not only a profound violation of human rights, but also a costly impediment to a country's national development. While gender-based violence occurs in many forms throughout the life cycle, this review focuses on two of the most common types-physical intimate partner violence and sexual violence by any perpetrator. Unfortunately, the knowledge base about effective initiatives to prevent and respond to gender-based violence is relatively limited. Few approaches have been rigorously evaluated, even in high-income countries. And such evaluations involve numerous methodological challenges. Nonetheless, the authors review what is known about more and less effective-or at least promising-approaches to prevent and respond to gender-based violence. They present definitions, recent statistics, health consequences, costs, and risk factors of gender-based violence. The authors analyze good practice initiatives in the justice, health, and education sectors, as well as <b>multisectoral</b> <b>approaches.</b> For each of these sectors, they examine initiatives that have addressed laws and policies, institutional reforms, community mobilization, and individual behavior change strategies. Finally, the authors identify priorities for future research and action, including funding research on the health and socioeconomic costs of violence against women, encouraging science-based program evaluations, disseminating evaluation results across countries, promoting investment in effective prevention and treatment initiatives, and encouraging public-private partnerships. ...|$|R

40|$|Sport {{is widely}} {{recognised}} for the contribution {{it can make}} to international development goals. More specifically, the value of sport {{as a tool for}} development gained its impetus through the HIV/AIDS pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa. The institutionalized relationship between sport and development has mainly focussed on sport-for-development (SfD) non-governmental organisations (NGOs). This study proposed to examine the response of National Sports Associations (NSAs) towards the <b>multisectoral</b> <b>approach</b> for HIV/AIDS prevention in Zambia. The study draws on lessons learnt from how NSAs within a resource-scarce or low-income country responded to a health pandemic. While public health was previously a state and health sector preserve, the impact of HIV/AIDS pandemic influenced not only the way that a pandemic is managed but also other public health issues. A case study approach was adopted comprising of three National Sports Associations (NSAs) as units of analysis. The study utilised semi-structured interviews, documentary analysis and field observations to gain perspectives on how each NSA mainstreamed and implemented work-based health programmes. Using governance and policy network theories, the paper discusses each NSAs’ role in the governance and implementation of a <b>multisectoral</b> <b>approach</b> to a health pandemic. The findings identified lack of engagement of sports agencies at strategic decision-making level, marginalisation of sport by other sectors, and variations in implementation patterns among sports agencies. Further findings indicate that lack of resources among government sport agencies or departments limited their involvement with other state or non-state actors in strategic level meetings or health policy networks. Resource-scarce conditions placed limitations on the political steer of state actors while non-state actors with foreign resources attracted collaboration from other public health policy networks...|$|E

40|$|The {{inclusion}} of gender mainstreaming and multisectoral frameworks in agricultural planning {{can be extremely}} helpful in understanding and measuring how development interventions impact women and men, girls and boys differently. The case study of gender mainstreaming in the health sector i. e. gender and HIV/AIDS, provides a useful example of how a gender analysis {{can serve as a}} critical tool for social change. Not only does a gender mainstreaming approach help to measure empowerment differentials between the sexes, it is also useful for assessing stakeholder assets and needs. This, in itself, provides a practical starting point in the program planning process. Gender assessment tools and indicators measure the impact of gender on performance and productivity and are transferable from one sector to another e. g. from health to agriculture. This paper addresses the lessons learned from the impact of HIV/AIDS on sustainable livelihoods in agriculture, with particular focus on the factors which place women and girls at greater risk of HIV infection. The paper also identifies gender and human rights indicators from the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) which are relevant to agricultural research. National system wide gender “mainstreaming” strategies provide practical approaches for integrating gender objectives into planning areas and expected outcomes. Additionally, monitoring and evaluation processes which integrate gender indicators into multisectoral policy and program reviews provide clear measures of citizen engagement and participation. These measures help planners to target resources and program interventions to specific audiences. They also reflect the extent to which women are empowered {{and the degree to which}} women’s and men’s contributions are recognized and valued in their respective societies.

40|$|There {{has emerged}} a {{consensus}} {{around the world}} that HIV/AIDS should be highlighted as a serious global problem. It is seen as a humanitarian, development and global security issue. Regardless of perceiving HIV/AIDS as a humanitarian, development or global security issue, our common consciousness of HIV/AIDS is related to two different aspects: to its occurrence in multiple countries and to the international policy context. Thus what is global about HIV/AIDS is not only the magnitude of the problem but also the approved response to the problem. The approved global response to HIV/AIDS is organized through a global governance regime. This regime consists of many multilateral and bilateral organizations, programs and funds which constitute a complex system. As a result of setting the HIV/AIDS on the global policy agenda, especially African states have had to adopt a <b>multisectoral</b> <b>approach</b> to their epidemics. Within the <b>multisectoral</b> <b>approach</b> there are different actors working against HIV/AIDS in cooperation. Consequence of the <b>multisectoral</b> <b>approach</b> is that the national level is bypassed and the global level is in direct contact with the local level. Despite the direct contact of global and local levels, Africans can very seldom get their voices heard within the global level. Due to this the practices of global governance and the experiences of Africans do not always correspond. This has made many projects that address HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa ineffective in tackling HIV/AIDS, but not ineffective in establishing authority. The research will address this disjunction and shed light on the effects of the global governance of sub-Saharan HIV/AIDS. Theoretically and methodologically the research is based on the analytics of government approach, which emanates from the work of Michel Foucault, although the research also contains methodological decisions that are based on the criticism of this approach. More specifically, the research addresses the global governance of sub-Saharan HIV/AIDS through the case of gender. This is because, even though homogenous and universal gender inequality is frequently rendered at the heart of Sub-Saharan HIV/AIDS, there has been vast work done by a bunch of researchers who emphasize the heterogeneity and dynamism of sexual and gender relations in Africa. Hence, it is only by through simplification that sub-Saharan HIV/AIDS can be made governable through gender. Furthermore, this governance is only practiced within specific limits. If these limits are violated promotion of gender equality is forgotten and authoritarian practices are put into action. This is especially salient when the global governance of sub-Saharan HIV/AIDS is examined through its collision with the management of migration. From these perspectives it is possible to view the gender-based governance of HIV/AIDS as a political struggle. According to the research, the contemporary global governance of sub-Saharan HIV/AIDS is unlikely to solve the health crisis, but it helps to keep sub-Saharan Africa governable. In addition, the governance can be harmful to traditional ways, customs and habits. Thus the governance is suitable for managing risks of contemporary world order, but at the cost of discrimination. However, this scenario is not inevitable as there are some possibilities for resistance...|$|E
40|$|Background: The MANIFEST {{study in}} eastern Uganda {{employed}} a participatory <b>multisectoral</b> <b>approach</b> to reduce barriers to access to maternal and newborn care services. Objectives: This study analyses {{the effect of}} the intervention on the utilization of maternal and newborn services and care practices. Methods: The quasi-experimental pre- and post-comparison design had two main components: community mobilization and empowerment, and health provider capacity building. The primary outcomes were utilization of antenatal care (ANC), delivery and postnatal care, and newborn care practices. Baseline (n = 2237) and endline (n = 1946) data were collected from women of reproductive age. The data was analysed using difference in differences (DiD) analysis and logistic regression. Results: The DiD results revealed an 8 % difference in early ANC attendance (p < 0. 01) and facility delivery (p < 0. 01). Facility delivery increased from 66 % to 73 % in the intervention area, but remained unchanged in the comparison area (64 % vs 63 %, p < 0. 01). The DiD results also demonstrated a 20 % difference in clean cord care (p < 0. 001) and an 8 % difference in delayed bathing (p < 0. 001). The intervention elements that predicted facility delivery were attending ANC four times [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1. 42, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 17 – 1. 74] and saving for maternal health (aOR 2. 11, 95 % CI 1. 39 – 3. 21). Facility delivery and village health team (VHT) home visits were key predictors for clean cord care and skin-to-skin care. Conclusions: The <b>multisectoral</b> <b>approach</b> had positive effects on early ANC attendance, facility deliveries and newborn care practices. Community resources such as VHTs and savings are crucial to maternal and newborn outcomes and should be supported.

40|$|Acute {{malnutrition}} puts over 50 {{million children}} {{at high risk}} of morbidity and mortality each year. Although treatment programs are efficacious, they neglect to address the condition's nondietary causes and program coverage rates are estimated to be below 15 %. Interest in <b>multisectoral</b> <b>approaches</b> for the prevention and treatment of acute malnutrition has grown rapidly over the last decade; rigorous evidence regarding the impact of such approaches is lacking. The objectives of this dissertation were to (1) examine the role of emergency cash transfer programs (CTPs) in the prevention of acute malnutrition, and (2) to determine whether stigma associated with acute malnutrition limits access to treatment programs. We used a longitudinal dataset from a cohort of 453 children and households targeted by an unconditional emergency CTP in Maradi, Niger, to identify factors associated with the risk of developing acute malnutrition during a food crisis in 2012. We then used data from a quasiexperimental study of a conditional emergency CTP in Tahoua, Niger, to evaluate its impact on child diet and weight gain during the same period, comparing 212 beneficiary children to 212 concurrent controls. Finally, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 711 caregivers attending health facilities in Marsabit County, Kenya, to assess barriers to accessing treatment for children with acute malnutrition. In Niger, our longitudinal study indicated that health and wealth-related factors were significant determinants of acute malnutrition risk. Diet-related factors and food expenditures were not associated with risk. Our quasi-experimental study revealed remarkable improvements in the diet and weight gain of beneficiary CTP children relative to controls. In Kenya, caregivers of acutely malnourished children were significantly more likely than others to report shame as a barrier to accessing treatment. We conclude that emergency CTPs have great potential to prevent acute malnutrition in contexts similar to the 2012 food crisis in Niger, although their ability to influence the health environment or to compensate for chronic poverty appears limited. Access to treatment for acute malnutrition is likely constrained by stigma in addition to a number of other well-established access barriers. There is a need for further critical evaluation of emergency CTPs as well as mechanisms to identify and reduce the sources of acute malnutrition-related stigma. 	   	   iv 2019 - 08 - 1...|$|R
