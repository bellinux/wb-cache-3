500|$|The word steak {{originates}} {{from the}} mid-15th century Scandinavian word , or stickna in the Middle English dialect, {{along with the}} Old Norse word steikja. The Oxford English Dictionary's first reference is to [...] "a thick slice of <b>meat</b> <b>cut</b> for roasting or grilling or frying, sometimes used in a pie or pudding; especially a piece cut from the hind-quarters of the animal." [...] Subsequent parts of the entry, however, refer to [...] "steak fish", which referred to [...] "cod of a size suitable for cutting into steaks", and also [...] "steak-raid", which was a custom among Scottish Highlanders of giving some cattle being driven through a gentleman's land to the owner. An early written usage of the word [...] "stekys" [...] comes from a 15th-century cookbook, and makes reference to both beef or venison steaks.|$|E

He carved the <b>meat,</b> <b>cut</b> the bread, and devoured his supper standing by the table, and now and then casting a glance towards his wife. Her prolonged immobility disturbed the comfort of his refection. He walked again into the shop, and came up very close to her. This sorrow with a veiled face made Mr Verloc uneasy. He expected, of course, his wife to be very much upset, but he wanted her to pull herself together. He needed all her assistance and all her loyalty in these new conjunctures his fatalism had already accepted.|$|E

6000|$|Substitutes for Pots and Kettles.--It is {{possible}} to boil water over a slow fire in many kinds of vessels that would be destroyed by {{a greater degree of}} heat. In bark, wooden, skin, and even paper vessels, it is quite possible to boil water. The ruder tribes of the Indian Archipelago use a bamboo to boil their rice: [...] "The green cane resisting the fire sufficiently long for the cooking of one mass of rice." [...] (Crawfurd.) If, however, you have no vessel that you choose to expose to the risk of burning, you must heat stones and drop them into the water it contains; but sandstones, especially are apt to shiver and make grit. The Dacota Indians, and very probably other tribes also, used to boil animals in their own hide. The description runs thus: [...] "They stuck four stakes in the ground, and tied the four corners of the hide up to them, leaving a hollow in the middle; three or four gallons of water, and the <b>meat</b> <b>cut</b> up very fine, were then put in; three or four hot stones, each the size of a 6-lb. cannon-shot, cooked the whole into a good soup." [...] To a fastidious palate, the soot, dirt, and ashes that are usually mixed up with the soup, are objectionable; but these may be avoided by a careful cook, who dusts and wipes the stones before dropping them in. The specific heat of stone is much less than that of water, so that the heating power of a measure of stone is only about one-half of that of an equal measure of equally hot water.|$|E

6000|$|A great loud bell: midday and {{the crew}} going to eat, rushing to eat. After some time we are summoned. [...] "The Signora isn't eating?" [...] asks the waiter eagerly: hoping she is not. [...] "Yes, she is eating," [...] say I. I fetch the q-b from her berth. Rather wanly she comes and gets into her spin chair. Bash comes a huge plate of thick, oily cabbage soup, very full, swilkering over the sides. We {{do what we can}} with it. So does the third passenger: a young woman who never wears a hat, thereby admitting herself simply as one of [...] "the people," [...] but who has an {{expensive}} complicated dress, nigger-coloured thin silk stockings, and suede high-heeled shoes. She is handsome, sturdy, with large dark eyes and a robust, frank manner: far too robustly downright for Italy. She is from Cagliari--and can't do much with the cabbage soup: and tells the waiter so, in her deep, hail-fellow-well-met voice. In the doorway hovers a little cloud of alpaca jackets grinning faintly with malignant anticipation of food, hoping, like blow-flies, we shall be too ill to eat. Away goes the soup and appears a massive yellow omelette, like some log of bilious wood. It is hard, and heavy, and cooked in the usual rank-tasting olive oil. The young woman doesn't have much truck with it: neither do we. To the triumph of the blow-flies, who see the yellow monster borne to their altar. After which a long long slab of the inevitable <b>meat</b> <b>cut</b> into innumerable slices, tasting of dead nothingness and having a thick sauce of brown neutrality: sufficient for twelve people at least. This, with masses of strong-tasting greenish cauliflower liberally weighted with oil, on a ship that was already heaving its heart out, made up the dinner.

The Simmentals had the highest birth weight with 40. 5 kg and the heaviest slaughter weight with 578 kg. Although having the longest fattening time, Limousins had the lowest slaughter weight, but were able to compensate this disadvantage through the highest slaughter yield of 60 % and with the biggest share of the pistol cut of 45 %. The German Angus compared with the other breeds appeared to have the most unfavourable results of performance, but the crossbreed (DA x FV) had the shortest fattening period, in which similar slaughter weights and weights of the two carcass halves were obtained. Both genotypes had a higher grade of adiposity and a visually lower muscularity, resulting in significantly lower shares of pistol <b>cut</b> and valuable <b>meat</b> <b>cuts.</b> Heifers absolutely and relatively differ in terms of <b>meat</b> <b>cuts</b> compared with bulls. Only the share of valuable <b>meat</b> <b>cuts</b> was similar. Certainly bulls had a stronger accentuation of the forequarter. Shares of shoulder and neck were higher.
