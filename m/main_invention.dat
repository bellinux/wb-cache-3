30|$|Research on {{innovation}} in firms is important as {{there may be}} a unique set of processes and resources involved that may help explain innovation as a critical factor in predicting SME performance (Anderson and Eshima 2011; Achtenhagen et al. 2010). Innovation has been discussed as {{the development of a new}} product, the process of developing a new product, or the adoption of a new product, which also can be investigated at various levels, such as the project level, industry sector, or region (Christenson 1997). It has been described as ‘the successful implementation of creative ideas’ (Amabile 1996, p. 1), which can lead to solutions to problems that can have a potential impact on revenues of a firm, industry sector effectiveness, and the prosperity of nations (Porter 1996; Harrison and Huntington 2000). The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) defines innovation as ‘a process that begins with an invention, proceeds with the development of the invention, and results in the introduction of a new product, process or service to the marketplace.’ Even more simply, Glynn (1996) described the process as two <b>main</b> phases: <b>invention</b> (initiation of the idea) and implementation.|$|R
5000|$|As James Jasinski explains, [...] "the {{range of}} rhetoric {{began to be}} narrowed during the 16th century, {{thanks in part to}} the works of Peter Ramus." [...] In using the word [...] "narrowed," [...] Jasinski is {{referring}} to Ramus argument for divorcing rhetoric from dialectic (logic), a move that had far reaching implications for rhetorical studies and for popular conceptions of public persuasion. Contemporary rhetoricians have tended to reject Ramus's view in favor of a more wide ranging (and in many respects, Aristotelian) understanding of the rhetorical arts as encompassing [...] "a broad range of ordinary language practices." [...] Rhetoric, traditionally, had had five parts, of which inventio (invention) was the first. Ramus insisted on rhetoric to be studied alongside dialectic through two <b>main</b> manuals: <b>invention</b> and judgement under the dialectic manual, and style and delivery in the rhetoric manual. Memory, one of the five skills of traditional rhetoric, was regarded by Ramus as being part of psychology, as opposed to being part of rhetoric, and thus dispensed form his idea of rhetoric and dialectic. Brian Vickers said that the Ramist influence here did add to rhetoric: it concentrated more on the remaining aspect of elocutio or effective use of language, and emphasised the role of vernacular European languages (rather than Latin). Ramist reforms strengthened the rhetoricians' tendency to focus on style. The effect was that rhetoric was applied in literature.|$|R

6000|$|There are one or {{two other}} points which {{indicate}} Hawthorne's method of basing his compositions, the result in the <b>main</b> of pure <b>invention,</b> on the solid ground of particular facts. Allusion is made, in {{the first chapter of}} the [...] "Seven Gables," [...] to a grant of lands in Waldo County, Maine, owned by the Pyncheon family. In the [...] "American Note-Books" [...] there is an entry, dated August 12, 1837, which speaks of the Revolutionary general, Knox, and his land-grant in Waldo County, by virtue of which the owner had hoped to establish an estate on the English plan, with a tenantry to make it profitable for him. An incident of much greater importance in the story is the supposed murder of one of the Pyncheons by his nephew, to whom we are introduced as Clifford Pyncheon. In all probability Hawthorne connected with this, in his mind, the murder of Mr. White, a wealthy gentleman of Salem, killed by a man whom his nephew had hired. This took place a few years after Hawthorne's graduation from college, {{and was one of the}} celebrated cases of the day, Daniel Webster taking part prominently in the trial. But it should be observed here that such resemblances as these between sundry elements in the work of Hawthorne's fancy and details of reality are only fragmentary, and are rearranged to suit the author's purposes.|$|R
40|$|Characterization {{of energy}} {{conversion}} of multiferroic materials {{is concerned with}} multifunctional properties of materials, a topic that is fascinating from the scientific {{point of view and}} important for the modern technology. The complex characterization of multiferroic structures suffers at present from lack of a systematic experimental approach and deficiency of multifunctional magnetoelectric properties testing capabilities. Compactness and high frequency energy conversion capacity are the <b>main</b> reasons of <b>invention</b> and improvement of sophisticated materials which are prepared for high-speed computer memories and broadband transducer devices. As a consequence, one can easily notice an intense search for new materials for generation, transformation and amplification of magnetic and electric energies. In this scenario, the combination of excellent piezoelectric and magnetic properties makes lead iron niobate Pb(Fe 1 / 2 Nb 1 / 2) O 3 (PFN) an attractive host material for application in integrated magnetoelectric energy conversion applications. PFN multiferroic materials are attractive for commercial electroceramics due to high value of dielectric permittivity and magnetoelectric coefficients as well as relatively easy synthesis process. However, synthesis of PFN ceramics is mostly connected with formation of the secondary unwanted pyrochlore phase associated with dramatic decrease of ferroelectric properties. The authors have successfully reduced this negative phenomenon by Mn doping and finally present high piezoelectric and magnetoelectric energy conversion efficiency in fabricated PMFN ceramics...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Online communities, in {{combination}} with innovation contests and social media, can create a context for ground-breaking innovation. Coalesced communications, accompanied by the long-standing "Hacker Ethic", and bolstered by the increasing prevalence of inexpensive tools such as	the 3 D	 printer and Raspberry Pi, have re-invigorated an older	model	of innovation whereby the tinkerer and hobbyist were positioned as a <b>main</b> source of <b>invention.</b> This paper states that this innovation model, following the	ideas of Nassim Nicholas Taleb, can be accurately described as “Antifragile”: i. e., it is not solely dependent {{on the success of}} one inventor, and can be geared to become stronger through the “failure” of individual projects and the sharing of data. Evidence is also presented which shows that this paradigm can also lead to "happy accidents", following Morton Meyers' assertion that "Three things	are certain about discovery: Discovery is unpredictable. Discovery requires serendipity. Discovery is a creative act" (Meyers, 2011, p. 24). For example, an	innovation contest in 2014 hosted by the online electronics engineering community element 14 whose original intent was to create a new "networked	pollution sensor" instead enabled the development of a Carbon Monoxide detector for Latvian classrooms,	a dust sensor for Singaporean streets, and an algal bloom detector for water supplies in the Philippines. As this example suggests, this paper also argues that setting ambiguous goals can inspire the aforementioned “happy accidents” that could potentially “grow mangoes	in Iceland”; too tightly defined aims can diminish the potential for this form of innovation...|$|R
40|$|Histories {{of major}} {{industrial}} research laboratories are an essential {{contribution to the}} history of technology. This book offers a description of the way one of such laboratories has changed its ambitions and activities in the course of time. In the 80 -year period that is described here, the Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium has played different roles for the Philips company - today one of the world's largest electronics company - which was founded in 1891 in the Netherlands. The history of this laboratory is described in three main periods, each characterized by its goals, available means, organizational structures, research culture, and external relations. For each period the general story line is alternated by case study descriptions. The Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium was founded in 1914. The term 'Natuurkundig' (in English: of physics) indicated that the task of the new laboratory was to conduct research of physics. Initially this research was related to light bulbs. At that time the Philips company, led by the two Philips brothers Anton and Gerard, was primarily a light bulb producing company. Soon the Nat. Lab. (this is the commonly used abbreviation of the full name) became the <b>main</b> source of <b>inventions</b> that would support the company in extending its product portfolio. In the course of time the goal of the lab's activities shifted in response to changes in its context, both within the Philips company and in a broader national and international context. Today the Philips Natuurkundig laboratorium is part of a worldwide research organization, Philips Research that generates options for new and improved products and processes and produces important patents in those electronics markets in which the company is active. It {{is still one of the}} world's major private research organizations. A key characteristic is the wide range of disciplines that are represented: from electrical engineering and physics to chemistry, mathematics, mechanics, information technology and software...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{traces the}} {{development}} of a new semiotic mode, kinetic typography. Kinetic typography began with the experiments of filmmakers like Len Lye and Norman McLaren. Later, film title designers like Saul Bass and Pablo Ferro drew on the shapes of letters with inventive metaphors – serifs, for instance could make letters walk, because they can stand for shoes as they are elongated horizontals on which something stands. In Saul Bass’ titles for Hitchcock's Psycho, the splitting of letters became a metaphor for the split mind of the film's <b>main</b> character. Such <b>inventions</b> eventually became part of a lexicon of clichés drawn on by designers across the world. Eventually, researchers and software designers began to formalize and systematize the language of kinetic typography, and the fruit of their work is now widely available, not only to specialists, but also to anyone who uses PowerPoint or Adobe AfterEffects, even though users may not always be aware of the lexico-grammatical rules which underlie the menus they choose from. And computers, being agnostic as to the kind of “objects” their operations operate on, apply these grammars to letters as well as other graphic forms, thus consolidating the multimodality of the language of movement. The second part of the paper discusses these formalizations, drawing on the kinetic design literature. Based on M. A. K. Halliday's transitivity theory, it sketches the outlines of a systemic grammar of movement that can make the meaning potential of kinetic typography explicit. The paper concludes with an analysis of art works created by David Byrne which use PowerPoint as a medium. Using PowerPoint's relatively simple movement grammar, Byrne has nevertheless succeeded in using movement creatively, giving us a glimpse of a future of creative writing which has kinetic typography at its very centre. 10 page(s...|$|R

It was simultaneously incorporated into the push to modernization and promoted as a part of an unbroken cultural legacy that defined the uniqueness of Chineseness in various forms during Republican China, Mao’s era and Post‐Mao era. The thesis also looks at the key figures and the process of institutionalization and indigenisation as the practice generated its own national professional associations and competitions in England since 1940 s.
