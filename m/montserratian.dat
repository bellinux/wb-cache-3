25|$|The {{steel band}} {{tradition}} {{is common to}} many Caribbean, and especially Lesser Antillean, islands. The <b>Montserratian</b> tradition began in 1949 in Ryner's Village and Kinsale, and was prominent enough by the following year to be played at the Empire Day celebrations. Despite some criticism that the music was degrading for children, steel bands have become {{a major part of}} the island's musical heritage.|$|E
25|$|The jumbie {{dance was}} {{probably}} last performed in 1980. Jumbies are traditionally {{said to be}} spirits, one of several kinds that also include the African sukra and jabless, and the Irish mermaid, animal spirit (similar to the Púca) and the Jack Lantern. Jumbies hold a similar place in <b>Montserratian</b> society as fairies does in Irish culture; they are the recipients of many small offerings, such as bits of food or drink, {{and the subject of}} numerous daily superstitions and rituals.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Montserratian</b> {{tradition}} of masquerading {{is both a}} ritual and celebratory element of folk music. Groups of dancers (masqueraders) with bright costumes and voluminous adornments, including whips (hunters) that are used for the Masqueraders to move crowds away as they parade the streets, scare away evil spirits and send signals to other dancers. Masqueraders travel door to door and receive small gifts, while dancing a standard set of dances consisting of a heel-and-toe polka and five quadrilles. This celebration begins in mid-December and ends January 1.|$|E

25|$|Allen {{became the}} first {{professional}} <b>Montserratian</b> sportsperson when he began playing in England during the northern summer, turning out for teams in the Lancashire and Cheshire Leagues. Allen's best season was 1976/77, where he scored 559 first-class runs at 50.81, with a highest score of 150. This form led to a lucrative offer to join the World Series Cricket competition when it commenced in Australia in late 1977. The {{only member of the}} West Indian squad not to play Test cricket, Allen appeared in three SuperTests against the Australians but struggled, scoring a total of 44 runs with a high score of 20.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a long}} {{gap between}} that match and Montserrat's next {{recorded}} appearance, which came in the 1969 Hesketh Bell Shield against Nevis. The following year, Jim Allen, considered Monterrat's greatest sportsman, debuted for the island. However, he would not become the islands first first-class cricketer, as William Duberry had played for the Leeward Islands in February 1967. Montserrat {{took part in the}} Hesketh Bell Shield and its replacement tournament, the Heineken Challenge Trophy, throughout most of the 1970s and the 1980s. Their participation in the tournament continued into the 1990s, with matches home throughout this period being held at Sturge Park, which has also held first-class cricket on six occasions up to 1994. From 1995, Montserrat was devastated by eruptions from Soufrière Hills. An eruption in 1997 destroyed Plymouth, with the resulting pyroclastic flows and ash fall from the eruption also destroying the main ground at Sturge Park, leaving the <b>Montserratian</b> team without first-class facilities.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the team}} {{continued}} to play on in regional tournaments in the late 1990s. By 2000, the team had a new home ground, the Salem Oval at Salem, where first-class cricket has since returned to on three occasions. Having played in regional tournaments throughout the early to mid 2000s, Montserrat were invited {{to take part in}} the 2006 Stanford 20/20, whose matches held official Twenty20 status. Allan Stanford gave US$100,000 for their participation. They played one match in the tournament against Guyana, which they lost to their first-class opponents by 8 wickets, resulting in their elimination from the tournament. Two years later, they were invited {{to take part in the}} 2008 Stanford 20/20, playing and defeating the Turks and Caicos Islands in a preliminary match, before losing to Nevis in the following round. In that same year, Lionel Baker became the first <b>Montserratian</b> to play One Day International and Test cricket for the West Indies.|$|E
50|$|Residents of Montserrat {{are known}} as <b>Montserratians.</b> The {{population}} consists {{of a number of}} ethnic groups, including Black (88.4%), White, Dual Heritage and Creole. The island's population is mainly a mix of Irish and Africans with other minorities.|$|R

50|$|Jumbies receive {{numerous}} small offerings from <b>Montserratians,</b> {{such as a}} {{few drops}} of rum or food. They are also the subject of numerous superstitions. It is believed that the spirit separates from the body three days after death, at which point the havoc begins. Jumbies are believed {{to have the ability to}} shape-shift, usually taking the form of a dog, pig, or more likely, a cat.|$|R
2500|$|Montserrat's folk musical {{heritage}} {{includes a}} wide array of religious and ritual folk music. There are also folk songs used in spiritual musical traditions, in addition to secular use; indeed, there is little distinction between secular and spiritual aspects of traditional <b>Montserratian</b> culture. Folk songs are generally in the Montserrat Creole language and concern topics ranging from obeah (magic) to agriculture, infidelity and historic occurrences. Many songs are widespread and well-known, and occur in numerous variations, including [...] "Nincom Riley" [...] and [...] "All de Relief", two of the most famous <b>Montserratian</b> folk songs. The folk repertoire also include calypsos and Irish melodies. The Irish <b>Montserratian</b> tradition has largely died out, with the last performer, George Allen, a fiddler, dying in 1966.|$|E
2500|$|Charles Henry [...] "Jim" [...] Allen (born 15 August 1951) is {{a former}} <b>Montserratian</b> {{first-class}} cricketer who {{was a part of}} the World Series Cricket West Indies XI and is considered the greatest ever Montserrat sportsperson.|$|E
2500|$|Some <b>Montserratian</b> Irish {{trace the}} origins of the jumbie dance to the pre-emancipation period, when slaves {{attempted}} to perform the dances performed by white overseers and landowners. Jumbie dances are traditionally performed after a celebration, in the home of a sponsor, and to mark times of individual crisis or major life changes, such as a wedding or christening.|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{a selection}} of the literary output provoked and inspired by the eruption of Soufrière Hills Volcano on Montserrat — notably poetry and prose written by <b>Montserratians</b> affected by the disaster. It argues that literature can {{be a source of}} local knowledge, and a window into a culture that is seeking to deal with a tragedy. It {{can also be used to}} assess outreach efforts and to investigate the impact of volcanic events – and of volcanological information – on local populations. The texts describe the process by which <b>Montserratians</b> moved from bewilderment and denial to renewal and re-identification, and even pride in the volcanic activity and their own ability to live with it — and to help prepare other Caribbean islands for future volcanic events. Literature looks both backwards and forwards, communicating the acts of experiencing and changing. On Montserrat, that applies both to colonialism and the role of the UK in Montserrat's political, economic and social life, and also to the importance of learning volcanology, and welcoming volcanologists, as a means of survival...|$|R
40|$|In {{the late}} 1990 s, massive {{volcanic}} eruptions destroyed Montserrat’s infrastructure and leveled the island’s capital, Plymouth. Today, Montserrat’s 4, 000 citizens are still {{coming to terms}} with this traumatic event. "Montserrat: Emerald of the Caribbean" explores how shared values—community, hope, faith—and traditions serve as sources of strength and identity for <b>Montserratians</b> as they rebuild their lives together. The film culminates in a portrayal of {{the sights and sounds of}} Montserrat’s annual St. Patrick’s Day Festival, a commemoration of African slaves who rebelled against their Irish slave masters on Saint Patrick’s Day, 1768. A unique blend of African, Caribbean, and Irish traditions, the Saint Patrick’s Day Festival represents the past, present, and future of a resilient people. In recording the events of Montserrat’s Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations and offering a space for <b>Montserratians</b> to speak to outsiders about its meaning, the film functions, in a way, as an intervention into the communication subfields of rhetoric, media studies, and culture. In terms of rhetoric, the film explores various local forums and styles of public address—poem recitations, calypso performance contests and radio public service announcements—to elucidate how <b>Montserratians</b> construct arguments, maintain collective memories, and motivate each other to ways of thinking and action as they struggle to rebuild a nation severely uprooted by volcanic eruptions. As a “media study,” the film offers an intimate portrayal of ZJB Radio, the island’s only local media outlet. Following prominent radio personalities Rose Willock and Basil Chambers, the film shows how ZJB Radio fulfills many roles on the island (much like early radio in the US) : town crier, public forum for debate, repository for local news and concerns. Furthermore, the film examines what one might consider to be non-traditional forms of media—intricately designed kites, cross-cultural “masquerade” dress—and shows how such non-traditional media convey specific messages to community members...|$|R

2500|$|Calypso is an {{originally}} Trinidadian {{style of}} music that has since spread across the world.

2500|$|<b>Montserratian</b> {{culture is}} {{generally}} {{a hybrid of}} African and European, specifically British and Irish, elements. [...] The African influence is the most pronounced, and manifests itself in the local Creole language, {{as well as the}} island's folktales, stories, songs, dances and religion. Montserrat remained largely isolated from international popular culture until the 1960s, and the island's folk traditions remained vibrant until the eruption of the Soufrière Hills volcano in 1995, after which most of the population left the island. The popularity of Arrow also contributed to the demise of traditional music, replaced largely by imported popular styles.|$|E

[...] A few months later, the island of Montserrat (one of the United Kingdom's few remaining overseas territories) was devastated by a volcanic eruption which rendered half the island uninhabitable; when the 4,500 islanders asked for more help from the DfID, Short was reported to have remarked [...] "they will be asking for golden elephants next" [...] and refused to visit the island. This remark caused great offence to the <b>Montserratians</b> and others; Labour MP Bernie Grant said that [...] "She sounds like a mouthpiece for an old nineteenth century colonial and Conservative government." ...|$|R

By 2001 he had switched parties, joining the New People's Liberation Movement.

A major issue for his government has been the continuing recovery of the island of Montserrat after a volcanic eruption which devastated the southern part of the island, burying the capital city of Plymouth in ash and forcing its population to flee, in many cases off the island due to lack of housing. The eruption, which began in July 1995, continues today on a vastly reduced scale, the damage being confined to Plymouth and the surrounding areas. , a new airport and docking facilities have opened and <b>Montserratians</b> and tourists alike are beginning to return.|$|R
