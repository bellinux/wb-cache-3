50|$|Also, a Microsoft-compatible mouse is recommended.

MCGA 320×200 (256 color) and 640×480 (2 color) drivers {{did not contain}} these instructions. This could be worked around by installing the Windows 2.x EGA/VGA drivers (which support <b>color</b> <b>menus</b> and frames, but not in-program graphics), replacing the CPU with an NEC V20/V30 (8086/88 pin-compatible chips with an 80186 instruction set), or by using a modified VGA driver that supports the 8086/88 (originally written in 2013). Microsoft had dropped support for the Tandy 1000 line by 1990, so a Tandy graphics driver was not provided for Windows 3.0, but the Windows 2.x Tandy driver could be copied into the target system and used.|$|R

40|$|Objective: Despite the {{importance}} of clinician-patient communication for safe medication management, {{little is known about}} rates and predictors of medication miscommunication. Measuring rates of miscommunication, as well as differences between verbal and visual modes of assessment, can inform efforts to more effectively communicate about medications. Methods: The researchers performed a study among long-term warfarin users in an anticoagulation clinic to assess concordance between patient and clinician reports of patient warfarin regimens. Bilingual research assistants asked patients to (1) verbalize their prescribed weekly warfarin regimen, and (2) identify this regimen from a digitized <b>color</b> <b>menu</b> of warfarin pills. The researchers obtained clinician reports of patient regimens from chart review. Patients were categorized as having regimen concordance if there were no patient-clinician discrepancies in total weekly dosage. Quantitative differences in concordance to the regimen were assessed verbally or visually. The researchers then examined whether verbal and visual concordance rates varied with the patient’s language and level of health literacy. Results: Fifty percent of patients achieved verbal concordance and 66 percent achieved visual concordance with clinicians regarding the weekly warfarin regimen (P < 0. 001). In adjusted models, being a Cantonese speaker and having inadequate health literacy were associated with a lower odds ratio for verbal concordance compared to being an English speaker and having adequate health literacy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0. 44, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 21 – 0. 93, P = 0. 03 and AOR = 0. 50, 95 % CI = 0. 26 – 0. 99, P = 0. 04, respectively). Neither language nor health literacy was associated with visual discordance. Conclusion: Clinician-patient discordance regarding patients’ warfarin regimen was common, but occurred less frequently when patients identified their regimen with a visual aid. Visual aids may improve the accuracy of medication assessment and may be especially beneficial for patients with communication barriers...|$|R
