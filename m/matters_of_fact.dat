It was acknowledged in Singapore Airlines {{that there may be}} <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> not in the public domain which may be known only to the executive. Where sensitive facts are concerned, Singapore's adversarial system is undesirable as parties must adduce evidence at a trial. Furthermore, not all pertinent facts might be presented before the court.|$|E

25|$|David Hume {{acknowledged}} {{that there are}} events constantly unfolding, humanity cannot guarantee that these events are caused by events prior or if they are independent instances. Hume opposed the widely accepted theory of Causation that ‘all events have a specific course or reason.’ Therefore Hume crafted his own theory of causation, which he formed through his empiricist and skeptic beliefs. He split Causation, into two realms “All the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally {{be divided into two}} kinds, to wit, Relations of Ideas, and Matters of Fact”. Relations of Ideas are a priori, and represent universal bonds between ideas that mark the cornerstones of human thought. <b>Matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fact</b> are dependent on the observer and experience. They are often not universally held to be true among multiple persons. Hume was an Empiricist, meaning he believed “causes and effects are discoverable not by reason, but by experience”. Hume later goes onto say that even with the perspective of the past, humanity cannot dictate future events because thoughts of the past are limited, compared to the possibilities for the future. Hume’s separation between <b>Matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fact</b> and Relations of Ideas {{is often referred to as}} “Hume’s Fork”.|$|E
25|$|Singer {{argues that}} {{equality}} of consideration is a prescription, not an assertion of fact: if {{the equality of}} the sexes were based only {{on the idea that}} men and women were equally intelligent, we would have to abandon the practice of equal consideration if this were later found to be false. But the moral idea of equality does not depend on <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> such as intelligence, physical strength, or moral capacity. Equality therefore cannot be grounded on the outcome of scientific investigations into the intelligence of nonhumans. All that matters is whether they can suffer.|$|E
25|$|While Russell wrote a {{great deal}} on ethical subject matters, he did not believe that the subject belonged to {{philosophy}} or that when he wrote on ethics that he did so in his capacity as a philosopher. In his earlier years, Russell was greatly influenced by G.E. Moore's Principia Ethica. Along with Moore, he then believed that moral facts were objective, but known only through intuition; that they were simple properties of objects, not equivalent (e.g., pleasure is good) to the natural objects to which they are often ascribed (see Naturalistic fallacy); and that these simple, undefinable moral properties cannot be analysed using the non-moral properties with which they are associated. In time, however, he came to agree with his philosophical hero, David Hume, who believed that ethical terms dealt with subjective values that cannot be verified {{in the same way as}} <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b>|$|E

500|$|The law {{dealing with}} seditious libel was {{particularly}} strict. Acting as [...] "the government's chief weapon against criticism", it followed principles {{laid down in}} De Libellis Famosis and R v Carr: that seditious libel was a criminal offence, that {{the intention of the}} publisher or the truth of the allegations was irrelevant, that mere publication was sufficient for a conviction, and that juries were only allowed to deliver a verdict on whether the material had been published by the defendant, not whether it was libellous. Traditionally, <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> were left to the jury and matters of law to the judge, but with seditious libel [...] "matters of law" [...] was construed very widely; it was the judge's job to decide if the material was libellous, what constituted [...] "seditious libel", and the nature of [...] "publication", which was understood to include almost anything. Even a private letter, if intercepted, could lead to a prosecution.|$|E
500|$|First, {{there are}} provinces of {{executive}} decision-making that are {{and should be}} immune from judicial review. This is reflected the doctrine of separation of powers embedded in Singapore's Westminster constitutional framework. Secondly, the span of executive decisions immune from judicial review include those involving matters of [...] "high policy", such as the dissolution of Parliament, the conduct of foreign affairs, the making of treaties, matters pertaining to war and the deployment of armed forces, and national defence. Deference should be accorded to the executive branch in respect of decisions concerning these matters. The High Court examined three cases which fall comfortably within this class. In The Fagernes (1927) the Court of Appeal of England and Wales considered the question of determining territorial boundaries, and held that [...] "any definitive statement from the proper representative of the Crown as to {{the territory of the}} Crown must be treated as conclusive". Aksionairnoye Obschestvo A. M. Luther v. James Sagor & Co. (1921) and Civil Aeronautics Administration v. Singapore Airlines Ltd. (2004) involved the recognition of sovereign status. It was held in Singapore Airlines that [...] "a question such as that which arises in the present case, whether an entity is a State so as to enjoy sovereign immunity in Singapore, is eminently a matter within the exclusive province of the Executive to determine, as what are involved in the question are not only <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> but also matters of policy".|$|E

2500|$|A {{more recent}} {{empiricism}} {{returns to the}} principle of the English empiricists of the 18th and 19thcenturies, in particular John Stuart Mill, who asserted that all knowledge comes to us from observation through the senses. This applies not only to <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> but also to [...] "relations of ideas", as Hume called them: the structures of logic which interpret, organize and abstract observations.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} part, Hume {{discusses}} how {{the objects of}} inquiry are either [...] "relations of ideas" [...] or [...] "matters of fact", which is roughly the distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions. The former, he tells the reader, are proved by demonstration, while the latter are given through experience. (Hume 1974:322) In explaining how <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> are entirely a product of experience, he dismisses {{the notion that they}} may be arrived at through a priori reasoning. For Hume, every effect only follows its cause arbitrarily—they are entirely distinct from one another. (Hume 1974:324) ...|$|E

2500|$|One of Kierkegaard's {{recurrent}} themes is {{the importance}} of subjectivity, which {{has to do with the}} way people relate themselves to (objective) truths. In Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, he argues that [...] "subjectivity is truth" [...] and [...] "truth is subjectivity." [...] What he means by this is that most essentially, truth is not just a matter of discovering objective facts. While objective facts are important, there is a second and more crucial element of truth, which involves how one relates oneself to those <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b> Since how one acts is, from the ethical perspective, more important than any matter of fact, truth is to be found in subjectivity rather than objectivity.|$|E
2500|$|Hume divided all {{of human}} {{knowledge}} into two categories: relations {{of ideas and}} <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> (see also Kant's analytic-synthetic distinction). Mathematical and logical propositions (e.g. [...] "that {{the square of the}} hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the two sides") are examples of the first, while propositions involving [...] some contingent observation of the world (e.g. [...] "the sun rises in the East") are examples of the second. All of people's [...] "ideas", in turn, are derived from their [...] "impressions". For Hume, an [...] "impression" [...] corresponds roughly with what we call a sensation. To remember or to imagine such impressions is to have an [...] "idea". Ideas are therefore the faint copies of sensations.|$|E

2500|$|In England the Royal Society was {{paving the}} way for new {{scientific}} thought which in turn reached its American colonies. The Royal Society fashioned its reputation by vigilantly developing and maintaining its membership as an assembly of gentlemen. [...] “The reliable witnessing of experiments by gentlemen was the only sure way to establish <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> about the physical realm.” With a list of members in the Society that included eighteen Americans, {{it is obvious that the}} Royal Society had a major influence in scientific development in the colonies in a variety of fields. The Royal Society encouraged their Fellows to participate in the scientific process by asking them to record the weather and share astronomical observations as well as any other events of scientific interest. John Winthrop the Younger, son of the first Massachusetts governor, John Winthrop, was among the original members.|$|E
2500|$|Any {{inquiry is}} open to the public, so members of the public or the press are able to observe the proceedings. [...] The {{tribunal}} may conduct the inquiry in private if necessary. [...] The tribunal has a range of powers to suppress the publication of information given at the inquiry. [...] For example, the tribunal may prohibit the publication of the names of the witnesses, the complainant or the nurse or midwife concerned. Where a person or organisation breaches this requirement, the person or organisation may be prosecuted for a criminal offence. The chairperson or deputy chairman decides all questions of law or matters of legal principle. Their decision is final on the point. [...] In <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> or evidence, three of the four members must agree. If the decision is split two-two, then the chairperson or deputy chairperson has the casting vote.|$|E
2500|$|Next, Hume ponders the {{justification}} of induction. If all <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> {{are based on}} causal relations, and all causal relations are found by induction, then induction must {{be shown to be}} valid somehow. He uses the fact that induction assumes a valid connection between the proposition [...] "I have found that such an object has always been attended with such an effect" [...] and the proposition [...] "I foresee that other objects which are in appearance similar will be attended with similar effects". One connects these two propositions not by reason, but by induction. This claim is supported by the same reasoning as that for causal relations above, and by the observation that even rationally inexperienced people can infer, for example, that touching fire causes pain. Hume challenges other philosophers {{to come up with a}} (deductive) reason for the connection. If a deductive justification for induction cannot be provided, then it appears that induction is based on an inductive assumption about the connection, which would be begging the question. Induction, itself, cannot validly explain the connection.|$|E
