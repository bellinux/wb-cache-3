500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Boston Herald, Sargent called Revenge [...] "a ticking bomb waiting to go off. ... Sid Sheinberg (president of MCA Inc., parent company of Universal Pictures) expects a miracle – and we're going to make it happen." [...] Sargent got a call from Sheinberg in late September 1986, asking him to direct the fourth Jaws movie with no script yet written. Said Sargent, [...] "I didn't have time to laugh because Sid explained he wanted to do a quality picture about human beings. When he told me, 'It's your baby, you produce and direct,' I accepted." [...] According to Sargent, Sheinberg [...] "cut through all the slow lanes and got Jaws: The Revenge off and running." [...] In a 2006 interview, Sargent stated that the premise was born [...] "out of a little bit of desperation to find something fresh to do with the shark. We thought that <b>maybe</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> take a mystical point of view, and go for a little bit of...magic, {{we might be able to}} find something interesting enough to sit through." ...|$|E
500|$|Inclement weather {{continued}} {{to disrupt the}} Saturday's proceedings as qualifying was delayed multiple times before being ultimately rescheduled for Sunday morning. Many drivers backed the decision, with Jenson Button saying: [...] "It {{was the right thing}} to do [...] In one respect, <b>maybe</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> decided three hours earlier it would have been better for the fans. But we wanted to get out there and drive and put on a show. Delaying it every half an hour was the way it had to be." [...] During the waiting period on Saturday, many teams had engaged in tomfoolery in the paddock to entertain the crowds, such as bowling or ballroom dancing between Red Bull teammates Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat. Ferrari later condemned the behaviour of their fellow teams, with team principal Maurizio Arrivabene saying: [...] "We are a Formula One team, not the Cirque du Soleil." [...] Kimi Räikkönen backed him, stating: [...] "I think this is F1 and not the circus. The people are obviously not happy when we're not running but we cannot make them happy with whatever we do apart from running." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} several appearances {{by several}} frequent guest stars, including Todd Buonopane as NBC Human resource mediator Jeffrey Weinerslav, Cheyenne Jackson as TGS cast member Danny Baker, Chris Parnell as Dr. Leo Spaceman, and Sherri Shepherd as Angie Jordan {{the wife of}} Tracy Jordan. Buonopane, Jackson, Parnell, and Shepherd made their fifth, eighth, sixteenth, and sixth appearances on the show, respectively. In an interview with TV Guide in November 2010, co-showrunner and executive producer Robert Carlock revealed that Shepherd's character [...] "will be getting her own Real Housewives-type reality show. Having the cameras around forces Tracy to act on better behavior." [...] This {{is evident in the}} following episode [...] "Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning". Tina Fey, the series creator, executive producer and lead actress on 30 Rock, told Entertainment Weekly, in regards to Angie's reality show, [...] "We're hoping to, <b>maybe,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can get away with it, do an entire episode that's just an episode of Queen of Jordan. Now I'm just superimposing my own TV viewing habits onto 30 Rock." [...] In the episode, Dr. Spaceman informs Tracy Jordan—played by Tracy Morgan—that he is dying, television columnist Meredith Blake from the Los Angeles Times wondered if this subplot was written as {{a way to deal with}} Tracy Morgan's recent kidney transplant as he is expected to miss several episodes to recover from the procedure.|$|E
40|$|So, should Delhi {{bid for the}} Olympics? Certainly not, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> are to have {{a repeat}} of how the Commonwealth Games (CWG) were organised; and of course not, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> {{are going to try}} and compete with Beijing 2008, which spent $ 40 billion (Rs 180, 000 crore!). But <b>maybe</b> yes, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can learn to do it differently, at modest budgets, and within cost â€” because some cities have done just that. But since the {{likelihood}} is that we will repeat the CWG experience, it is probably better to keep away from bidding for the 2020 Olympics.

5000|$|In {{a review}} for Barnes & Noble, George Scialabba writes that [...] "Some {{of the most}} {{affecting}} pages in The Life You Can Save describe the low-tech, low-cost programs that have restored sight to a million people blinded by cataracts and have rescued many thousands {{of women and children}} from lives blighted by cleft palates or obstetric fistulas". Scialabba concludes [...] "For those willing to do more than the bare minimum, Singer has worked out a detailed chart specifying how much everyone at every income level should give... Is this unrealistic? <b>Maybe.</b> But <b>if</b> <b>we</b> don't do it, our 26th-century descendants will be heartily ashamed of us." ...|$|R
5000|$|On April 8, 2013, Wolf Hoffmann told Chile's Radio Futuro that Accept {{had begun}} writing new {{material}} for their fourteenth studio album and would [...] "definitely {{go back to}} the studio as soon as they can." [...] Four months later, on August 9 at the Bloodstock Open Air festival 2013, Wolf told Metal Shock Finland: Our upcoming album is hopefully going to be out next year. We've started working on writing some songs; we haven't recorded anything yet. But over the winter — maybe early next year — we'll start recording it and try to make it every bit as good as the last one, <b>maybe</b> even better, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> succeed, we'll see... It's going to be as heavy as the rest.|$|R
2500|$|In Karrewiet, a Flemish {{news program}} for children, Leterme was interviewed. He said [...] "We could {{make sure that}} they [...] could build schools more cheaply.

They know the fate that awaits them, after provoking the anger of Rome. They know they are fighting for faith, for country, and their families, and will fight desperately. They greatly outnumber the Romans--at least, the army by which we shall first be attacked--and <b>maybe,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can resist that, we may make terms with Rome for, assuredly, {{in the long run}} she must overpower us." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, {{that is the}} {{one thing}} bad, we shall have to go out to fetch water, but <b>maybe</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> dig {{in the center of the}} channel we shall find it. The best place to try will be at the end, right under where the {{waterfall}} comes down in winter. There is most always a deep hole in the rock there, where the water and stones and so on have come down and pounded away the bed rock. We found where the gold comes from too. There is a big quartz vein running right up the face of the cliff there; it is just full of gold. You can see it sparkle everywhere. Some day, when the Indians is all wiped out, fellows will bring machinery and powder, and will have one of the richest mines in the world. However, that don't concern us. I reckon there is enough in this gravel under our feet to make a hundred men rich. Now, Boston, what do you think is the best thing to do first?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{tell you}} we were glad to hear the thud of their hoofs, for we knew that that must stop the cannon {{for a minute and}} give us a chance of hitting back. And we hit back pretty hard too that time, for we were cold and vicious and savage, and I for one felt that I cared no more for the {{horsemen}} than if they had been so many sheep on Corriemuir. One gets past being afraid or thinking of one's own skin after a while, and you just feel that you want to make some one pay for all you have gone through. We took our change out of the lancers that time; for they had no breastplates to shield them, and we cleared seventy of them out of their saddles at a volley. <b>Maybe,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> could have seen seventy mothers weeping for their lads, we should not have felt so pleased over it; but then, men are just brutes when they are fighting, and have as much thought as two bull pups when they've got one another by the throttle.|$|E

5000|$|In a December 2011 interview, Canada's {{new foreign}} affairs {{minister}} John Baird attributed {{the failure to}} win a seat to principled positions taken by Canada on certain international issues: “Maybe if we had shut up, and not talked about gay rights in Africa; <b>maybe</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> had shut up and been more quiet about our concerns about Sri Lanka; <b>maybe</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> hadn't been so vocally against the deplorable human rights record in Iran, maybe Iran might have voted for us....

5000|$|Twenty-seven Olympic gold medals, two silver {{medals and}} one bronze medal ~ {{that is what}} Bengal's hockey can boast of. However, all that is history and Kolkata no longer has a hockey Olympian. Despite its {{pioneering}} role {{in the history of}} Indian hockey, Kolkata is the only major metropolis in India without an artificial turf. “How can you hope to produce international class players if you cannot give the players astroturf to play on?” asks Gurbux Singh, secretary of the Bengal Hockey Association. Leslie Claudius agreed that the absence of astroturf is responsible for this decline, but added: “Ours was a different era. We were successful, so the enthusiasm for the game was naturally high. How can you have that today? Even the educational institutions are not interested in hockey nowadays. But you can’t blame them. Young people don't find hockey exciting enough. <b>Maybe</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can give them astroturf, the fast surface can lure them back into the game.” ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Information Systems (IS) have {{influenced}} and changed {{our lives in}} the past 50 years {{more than anything else}} – be it in the professional, be it in the private sector. Three main qualities have leveraged IS to this extraordinary position: persistence (supporting and extending human memories), individual availability and distribution – now world-wide through the internet and innumerable web-based applications and services. At the beginning 21 st century, new technical prospects are opening new dimensions for IS: Due to the progressive miniaturisation of hardware components, next IS generations are mobile and pervasive, do no longer reside in computer mainframes and workstations but are clusters of “intelligence ” which can be implanted almost everywhere and have thus been termed ambient or ubiquitous. In this article, we will briefly review the concept and history of IS and try to define what Ambient Information Systems (AIS) might be and which role they might play in a future Information Society. In particular, we shall deal with the phenomena of information and ambience, investigate their semiotic dimensions – and raise the question whether and how far human qualities like intelligence, intention, etc. can be attributed to impersonal, highly heterogeneous and <b>maybe</b> abstract systems. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> are going to embed ourselves in ambient systems, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> grant these to deal with information (instead of data) and to act intelligently, this might profoundly influence our image of man – in particular as qualities like autonomy, privacy or self-esteem are concerned. ...|$|R

5000|$|The race {{restarted}} with 28 laps to go, Newman {{lost the}} lead to Joey Logano and he held off a hard-charging Kyle Larson to score his fifth win of the season. “It was a crazy race, and I had such a fast Pennzoil Ford," [...] said Logano. It is awesome {{to be back in}} victory lane. When the top opened up, the car just took off. Me and the No. 42 (Kyle Larson) were the only ones that seemed to be able to run up there.
