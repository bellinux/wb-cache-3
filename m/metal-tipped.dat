5|$|The use of {{elephants}} in circuses {{has also been}} controversial; the Humane Society of the United States has accused circuses of mistreating and distressing their animals. In testimony to a US federal court in 2009, Barnum & Bailey Circus CEO Kenneth Feld acknowledged that circus elephants are struck behind their ears, under their chins and on their legs with <b>metal-tipped</b> prods, called bull hooks or ankus. Feld stated that these practices are necessary to protect circus workers and acknowledged that an elephant trainer was reprimanded for using an electric shock device, known as a hot shot or electric prod, on an elephant. Despite this, he denied {{that any of these}} practices harm elephants. Some trainers have tried to train elephants without the use of physical punishment. Ralph Helfer is known to have relied on gentleness and reward when training his animals, including elephants and lions. Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey circus retired its touring elephants in May 2016.|$|E
5|$|The arid {{conditions}} of the spiny forest, which receives less than 600 millimeters of rainfall each year, largely shape Mikea economic activities. Nearly everything they consume is scavenged from the forest, and the average Mikea needs two hours or less to collect adequate food for the day. Their main source of food is tubers, particularly {{during the dry season}} when few other foods may be reliably available. Adults and children of both genders work to dig up using a <b>metal-tipped</b> digging stick (antsoro) and a digging bowl (kipao). The starchy ovy tuber is roasted or boiled before eating, while the Mikea eat the watery babo (or baboho) raw for hydration or use its water for boiling other foods; the tavolo tuber is dried and ground to make a flour that is sold at village markets. They also gather forest fruits, melons and honey, with the latter a particularly important source of income for the Mikea during the rainy season. To obtain water during the rainy season the Mikea capture rain run-off from the rooftops of their houses using hollowed-out logs or transport water on foot or zebu-drawn wagon from the villages, while during the cool dry season the Mikea consume their store of water-engorged babo tubers and drink water from natural or man-made wells when possible.|$|E
25|$|In {{conjunction}} with {{various forms of}} artillery, the Macedonians possessed the ability to build an effective array of siege engines. Prominent {{in a number of}} sieges, including the epic Siege of Tyre (332 BC), were siege towers; these allowed men to approach and assault the enemy walls without being exposed to potentially withering missile fire. Equally, they meant that more men could be put on the walls in a shorter period of time, as simple ladders constrained the men attacking to moving up in single file, thus making the task of defending the walls far easier. These structures, which were wheeled and several stories high, were covered with wet hide or metal sheathing to protect from missile fire, especially incendiaries, and the largest might be equipped with artillery. The Macedonian army could also deploy various forms of suspended, <b>metal-tipped,</b> rams. Such rams were usually provided with a wheeled, roofed covering to protect their users from missile fire; they were employed to batter down gates or to dislodge masonry from walls and so cause a breach (this latter form was sometimes called a 'drill' rather than a ram).|$|E

50|$|From {{around a}} {{thousand}} years ago, the Ancient Tea Route was a trade link from Yunnan, {{one of the first}} tea-producing regions: to Bengal via Burma; to Tibet; and to Central China via Sichuan Province. In addition to tea, the mule caravans carried salt. Both people and horses carried heavy loads, the tea porters sometimes carrying over 60-90 kg (132-198 lb.), which was often more than their own body weight in tea.

Their transports were approximately 30 m long, 9 m wide and 12 m high, with a crew of 100. Each one could carry up to 600 infantry. The horse carriers featured specially designed slings to carry their cargo of horses, and featured a fold-out ramp below the waterline that could be opened to allow mounted knights to charge directly onto shore. The Venetian warships were powered by 100 oarsmen each and featured a <b>metal-tipped</b> ram just above the waterline as their primary weapon. They also carried more than 300 siege weapons.|$|E

5000|$|After {{recording}} multiple {{songs for}} the album, Grande stated {{that she had}} chosen the first single from her album. On April 15, 2014, it was officially announced that [...] "Problem" [...] would be {{the title of the}} lead single from the album. Grande later hinted that Australian rapper Iggy Azalea would accompany her on the track. She created online buzz in {{the weeks leading up to}} her single's release through social media, first released promotional images from the single's photo shoot all throughout March 2014. On April 10, 2014, Grande asked her fans to choose between two new possible images to be used for the single's artwork release. After the votes were tallied, she revealed the winning cover artwork through her Instagram account the next day with the hashtag #10daystilproblem, and revealed that Iggy Azalea would be assisting her on the track. The winning image, was the more seductive image of the pair, which shows Grande leaning back in a foldout chair, dressed in a black camisole, white thigh-highs and <b>metal-tipped</b> stilettos. Grande is also shown flipping through her hair while looking directly into the camera. The song was released at midnight to iTunes on April 28, 2014. The single was made available for pre-order on April 21, 2014. The single made its world radio premiere on On Air with Ryan Seacrest on April 28, 2014. A remix of the song was released on May 16, 2014 entitled the [...] "Young California Remix" [...] and features an additional rap verse from American rapper Problem. A Spanglish version of the song was also released featuring Colombian rapper J Balvin for the Hispanophone market, making it the second collaboration between the two artists.

5000|$|Born in Antonossa, in the Province of Álava (Basque County), Spain, Andrés Quintana {{joined the}} Franciscan Order in 1794 {{when he was}} 17 years of age. Nine years later he had {{completed}} his formation and achieved the priesthood {{in the province of}} Cantabria (in northern Spain), as did a great many of the Spanish missionaries. In 1804 he sailed to the New World to join the missionary College of San Fernando de Mexico, a springboard for all missionaries doing work in New Spain. There he received further instruction and preparation for his assignment to Mission Santa Cruz. Sailing from San Blas in 1805, he arrived at Monterey, capital of Spanish Alta California, and became one of two missionary fathers stationed at Mission Santa Cruz. He was killed at the mission on the evening of October 12, 1812, by Indians under his care. The following notation appears on his burial record:"Andrés was from the province of Cantabria Spain. OFM Bro. José Casa Viader, minister of Mission Santa Clara, sang the mass over his body, accompanied by OFM Bro. Narciso Durán, minister of Mission San José, who learned of his passing and came to this mission. The deceased was found early in the morning dead in his bed of natural causes. notation: A more thorough investigation was ordered by the military governor. During this investigation it was learned that he had been suffocated by Christian Indians of this mission and Mission Santa Clara. Andrés was summoned to the orchard of this mission where a patient feigned illness, and there he was suffocated his dead body returned to his quarters." [...] According to another source, Brother Andrés was murdered because of his plans to use a <b>metal-tipped</b> whip to punish Indian converts. He is considered one of two martyr priests who served in the coastal missions of California.The publication of this oral history given by Lorenzo Asisara in 1878 by scholar and native American Edward Castillo in 1989 was counted as proof that Spaniards treated Indians with brutality at missions. Later, the story was immortalized in at least one novel.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to establish a recommended procedure for performing multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) on pavements as well as evaluating the ability of MASW to detect a change in shear wave velocity as damage in concrete increases. The tests for establishing a recommended procedure for performing MASW on pavements was conducted at five sites at the University of Arkansas Engineering Research Center in Fayetteville, Arkansas. The five sites consisted of three materials: asphalt, concrete, and soil (two sites were on asphalt, two were on concrete, and one was on soil). The methods evaluated at these sites include the source type, distance from the source to the first receiver in the array (i. e., source offset), the spacing between receivers in the array, and the minimum number of receivers in the array. It was determined that for the data collected on asphalt, the optimum procedure included a 230 g <b>metal-tipped</b> hammer, 2. 5 cm receiver spacing, a minimum of 24 receivers, and source offsets of 12. 5 cm, 25 cm, and 50 cm. For concrete, the optimum procedure included a 230 g <b>metal-tipped</b> hammer, 5 cm receiver spacing, a minimum of 18 receivers, and source offsets of 12. 5 cm, 25 cm, 50 cm, and 75 cm. For soil, the optimum procedure included a 230 g <b>metal-tipped</b> hammer, 5 cm receiver spacing, a minimum of 12 receivers, and source offsets of 12. 5 cm, 25 cm, and 50 cm. Additionally, it was determined from a limited data set of six tests, that MASW has the ability to detect a decrease in shear wave velocity as damage increases up to a strain level of at least 0. 09 %. However, MASW testing done on concrete with expansions of 0. 09 % and 0. 29 % showed only a 2 % difference in shear wave velocity between the two large strain sections. Given the data collected it cannot be determined if MASW can be used to differentiate between concrete sections with strains larger than 0. 09 % (i. e., sections with heavy damage) ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of <b>metal-tipped,</b> plastic-tipped, and electronic ear tags on the likelihood of infection using infrared thermography and to evaluate the effect on welfare by examining the behavioral responses of the lambs. Ninety lambs with an average age of 6  months were used in this study. Before the application of the ear tags, infrared images of the right and left ears of the lambs were taken with the thermal camera and the infrared temperatures were recorded. Measurements were repeated on days 1, 4, 10, and 30 after the ear tag application. The mean of infrared ear temperatures on days 0, 1, 4, 10, and 30 were found to be 14. 60, 23. 20, 23. 77, 20. 36, and 17. 61  °C for the <b>metal-tipped</b> ear tag group; 15. 69, 21. 50, 20. 42, 18. 00, and 16. 39  °C for the plastic-tipped ear tag group; and 15. 17, 29. 47, 27. 49, 25. 93, and 20. 61  °C for the electronic ear tag group. The infrared temperatures on days 1, 4, and 10 in the control and experimental groups were significantly different from each other (P  <  0. 001). The plastic-tipped ear tags caused fewer problems and are preferred to the traditional ear tags with metal tips. The electronic ear tags caused more inflammatory reactions compared to metal- or plastic-tipped ear tags. The infrared thermography method may be used as a useful tool in the early detection of the inflammatory reactions and infections caused by the application of ear tags...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of passage {{time of the}} transfer gun through the uterine cervix and body to the embryo insertion site on pregnancy rate was analysed in 248 recipient heifers (mean age: 15 – 17 months). Embryos (90 fresh and/or 88 and 70 frozen in glycerol and ethylene glycol, respectively, grades 4 and 5, stage 1 or 2) were transferred to the ipsilateral uterine horn on day 7. Two different transfer guns were used in this experiment: a sterilisable steel transfer instrument to be used without sheaths with a removable tip made of gold-plated stainless steel (Wörrlein Minitüb) or a transfer stylet with sheaths with a metal tip and a side opening (Cassou gun, IMV Technologies). The time of passage of the instruments through the uterine cervix and body {{to the site of}} embryo deposition in the uterine horn was measured in the study. In order to randomise the risk of errors, all manipulations were carried out by the same experienced operator. The average time needed for the insertion of embryos into the uterus was 50. 6 seconds (s) and it was longer for the transfer gun with sheaths than for the <b>metal-tipped</b> transfer gun (60. 1 and 40. 8 s, respectively) (P 120 s − 28. 0, 6. 0 and 24. 9 %, respectively).

40|$|Weaving {{together}} language evidence, oral narratives, and European travelers 2 ̆ 7 accounts, this dissertation reconstructs {{the earliest}} social and agricultural {{history of the}} Rio Nunez region. With original language data for Nalu, MbuluNuc, Mboteni, and Sitem, under-studied and little-documented languages, it establishes a language classification and settlement chronology for the Coastal and Mel subgroups. An analysis of reconstructed cultural vocabulary words related to agriculture reveals that coastal dwellers developed irrigated rice-farming systems as {{a small part of}} much larger processes of adaptation to coastal micro-niches. Between c. 3000 to 2000 BCE, proto-Coastal-speakers developed planting techniques and adapted to the coastal mangrove region. From c. 2000 BCE to 1 CE, pre-Nalu-, pre-MbuluNuc-, and pre-Mboteni-speakers cut down trees, cleared land, and drained swampy soils. With the subsequent migration of pre-Sitem-speakers into the Rio Nunez c. 1 to 1000 CE, coastal inhabitants innovated and adapted irrigated rice-farming techniques and material culture to microenvironments along the coast and borrowed rice-farming techniques from their Susu-speaking neighbors. ^ The study uses oral narratives and European sources to trace the role of rice in the formation of coastal identities and domestic economies. An analysis of oral narratives shows that coastal elders 2 ̆ 7 memories of their ancestors growing rice in the interior and while migrating to the coast reflect their adaptation to unpredictable coastal environments. And, their association of the wooden <b>metal-tipped</b> shovel with the coast reflects their construction of a coastal identity that unifies these disparate speech communities. An analysis of travelers 2 ̆ 7 accounts reveals from descriptions of coastal inhabitants hunting, fishing, and farming for subsistence and for trade in the 15 th and 16 th centuries to descriptions of them producing surplus rice for sale between the 17 th and 19 th centuries. The study concludes that rice took center stage in coastal economies and in coastal identities as a result of coastal commercial and colonial expansion. ...|$|E
