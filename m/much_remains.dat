5|$|Downtown Amman, {{the city}} centre area (known in Arabic as Al-Balad), has been {{dwarfed by the}} {{sprawling}} urban area that surrounds it. Despite the changes, <b>much</b> <b>remains</b> of its old character. Jabal Amman is a well-known touristic attraction in old Amman, where the city's greatest souks, fine museums, ancient constructions, monuments, and cultural sites are found. Jabal Amman also contains the famous Rainbow Street and the cultural Souk Jara market.|$|E
5|$|A {{lingering}} controversy {{exists in}} ichthyology over {{the validity of}} the four species Beebe described on the basis of visual descriptions only, which he had observed during his Bathysphere dives. The naming of a new species ordinarily requires obtaining and analyzing a type specimen, something which was obviously impossible from inside the Bathysphere. Some of Beebe's critics claimed that these fish were illusions resulting from condensation on the Bathysphere's window, or even that Beebe willfully made them up, although the latter would have been strongly at odds with Beebe's reputation as an honest and rigorous scientist. While many of Beebe's observations from the Bathysphere have since been confirmed by advances in undersea photography, it is unclear whether others fit the description of any known sea animal. One possibility is that although these animals indeed exist, so <b>much</b> <b>remains</b> to be discovered about life in the deep ocean that these animals have yet to be seen by anyone other than him.|$|E

25|$|The {{two cities}} of Troy and Thebes were the {{major focus of}} Greek epic poetry. The events {{surrounding}} the Trojan War were chronicled in the Epic Cycle, of which <b>much</b> <b>remains,</b> and those about Thebes in the Theban Cycle, which have been lost. The Theban Cycle recounted the sequence of tragedies that befell the house of Laius, of which the story of Oedipus is a part.|$|E
25|$|The Calliphoridae (commonly {{known as}} blow flies, blow-flies, carrion flies, bluebottles, greenbottles, or cluster flies) are {{a family of}} insects in the order Diptera, with 1,100 known species. The maggot larvae, often used as fishing bait, are known as gentles. The family {{is known to be}} polyphyletic, but <b>much</b> <b>remains</b> disputed {{regarding}} proper treatment of the constituent taxa, some of which are occasionally accorded family status (e.g., Bengaliidae, Helicoboscidae, Polleniidae, and Rhiniidae).|$|E

25|$|Unlike the few {{remaining}} remnants of King's Hall north of King Edward's Tower, following the building of Great Court {{at the end of}} the 16th century, nothing <b>much</b> <b>remains</b> of the original Michaelhouse buildings, though its stones probably served as ready building materials. While the Hall was adapted for use by the new college in 1547, its walls are now hidden behind the 18th-century ashlaring of the kitchens and combination rooms south of the present Dining Hall.|$|E
25|$|Apophysomyces variabilis {{is one of}} four {{species in}} the genus Apophysomyces, which also {{includes}} A. elegans, A. ossiformis, and A. trapeziformis. In the past, Apophysomyces elegans was believed to be the species responsible for most cases of cutaneous mucormycosis attributed to Apophysomyces, but recently, some of the other species {{have been shown to be}} important in human infection. Since the new species have only recently been recognized, <b>much</b> <b>remains</b> to be learned about their relative clinical importance, comparative virulence, epidemiology, and anti-fungal drug susceptibilities.|$|E
25|$|The Ozarks contain ore {{deposits}} of lead, zinc, iron and barite. Many of these deposits have been depleted by historic mining activities, but <b>much</b> <b>remains</b> {{and is currently}} being mined in the Lead Belt of southeast Missouri. Historically the lead belt around the Saint Francois Mountains and the Tri-state district lead-zinc mining area around Joplin, Missouri, have been very important sources of metals. Mining practices common in the early 20th century left significant abandoned underground mine problems and heavy metal contamination in topsoil and groundwater in the Tri-state district.|$|E

25|$|Ireland was {{inhabited}} sometime {{shortly after}} {{the ending of the}} last Ice Age, approximately 10,000 – 8000 BC Conservative estimates place the arrival of the first humans in County Wexford as occurring between 5000 BC – 3000 BC, referred to as the Mesolithic period in Ireland, though they may have arrived slightly earlier. Its proximity to Britain and Europe means that County Wexford {{was probably one of the}} earliest areas of Ireland to be inhabited by humans. Evidence of this period is scarce and <b>much</b> <b>remains</b> to be discovered through Archaeology and Research.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{of genetically}} {{engineered}} crops have raised various concerns. An early issue was that golden rice originally did not have sufficient vitamin A. This problem was solved {{by the development of}} new strains of rice. The speed at which vitamin A degrades once the rice is harvested, and how <b>much</b> <b>remains</b> after cooking are contested. However, a 2009 study concluded that golden rice is effectively converted into vitamin A in humans and a 2012 study that fed 68 children ages 6 to 8 concluded that golden rice was as good as vitamin A supplements and better than the natural beta-carotene in spinach.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, <b>much</b> <b>remains</b> to be achieved. According {{to survey}} data {{analyzed}} by the Joint Monitoring Program for Water and Sanitation of WHO and UNICEF, about 100 million Chinese {{still did not}} have access to an improved water source in 2008, and about 460 million did {{not have access to}} improved sanitation. Progress in rural areas appears to lag behind what has been achieved in urban areas. According to data presented by the Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation of WHO and UNICEF in 2015, about 36% of the rural population in China still did not have access to improved sanitation.|$|E

25|$|Town Wall. Established by charter in 1326 by Edward II to the Bailiffs of Carlingford {{it allowed}} them to levy murage for its building. Not <b>much</b> <b>remains</b> however but the little that does has some {{externally}} splayed musket loops that would indicate the arrival of firearms to Ireland in the late 15th century. It {{is likely that the}} wall had an external ditch to strengthen its defences. Its purpose was to serve as a barrier to ensure that goods entering the town had to pass through a town gate (and hence could be taxed) but it also had the purpose of creating a boundary between Gael and Norman.|$|E
25|$|Long-term {{benefits}} {{have also been}} associated with those patients who receive surgery, radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy. However, <b>much</b> <b>remains</b> unknown about why some patients survive longer with glioblastoma. Age of under 50 is linked to longer survival in glioblastoma multiforme, as is 98%+ resection and use of temozolomide chemotherapy and better Karnofsky performance scores. A recent study confirms that younger age {{is associated with a}} much better prognosis, with a small fraction of patients under 40 years of age achieving a population-based cure. The population-based cure is thought to occur when a population's risk of death returns to that of the normal population, and in GBM, this is thought to occur after 10 years.|$|E
25|$|The Church {{was one of}} {{the first}} tall brick-and-sandstone {{buildings}} in the city. The original 13th-century Gothic structure was consecrated before 1269, and expanded in 1260–70. Not <b>much</b> <b>remains</b> from that particular period other than the ribbed 13th-century vault. Presbytery was elongated beginning in 1401 with the three-sided apsis (pictured). The cross-shaped central part with nave arcades was added around 1420–36 (the original chancel was straight). The annexes gave the temple a shape of a Greek cross for the first time. The expansion was re-consecrated by Cardinal Zbigniew Oleśnicki in 1436. In spite of various calamities (1462, 1476, 1655), the Church of St. Francis of Assisi and the adjacent Monastery experienced the most destructive fire only in 1850. The written records of its consecration along with priceless artifacts were lost.|$|E
