5|$|Like regular {{characters}} in Fortress mode, characters have thirst, hunger and exhaustion levels. To survive, they <b>must</b> <b>eat,</b> drink and sleep. They {{need to take}} shelter at night when evil creatures like bogeymen come out. In addition to the regular combat mechanism, in this mode, the player can also choose which body parts to strike. A player can visit their retired or ruined fortresses made in Fortress mode. Instead of quitting, the character can be retired, and depending on the player's achievements, their life events will be documented in the Legends mode among the historical figures.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} has a {{metabolic}} rate {{two or three}} times that of comparatively sized terrestrial mammals. It <b>must</b> <b>eat</b> an estimated 25 to 38% of its own body weight in food each day to burn the calories necessary to counteract the loss of heat due to the cold water environment. Its digestive efficiency is estimated at 80 to 85%, and food is digested and passed in as little as three hours. Most of its need for water is met through food, although, in contrast to most other marine mammals, it also drinks seawater. Its relatively large kidneys enable it to derive fresh water from sea water and excrete concentrated urine.|$|E

5|$|A {{computer}} program such as KetoCalculator {{may be used}} to help generate recipes. The meals often have four components: heavy whipping cream, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale accurate to 1g. The child <b>must</b> <b>eat</b> the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil {{may be used to}} help with constipation or to increase ketosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{other boys}} find Pi Pi, who informs them the park can be drained of the {{inundation}} if someone can swim through the pee {{to reach an}} emergency release valve. Kyle reluctantly agrees {{to do the job}} as he said {{at the start of the}} episode that he could hold his breath for the longest, but is horrified to learn he must drink some of the pee in order to offset the fluid pressure he will encounter at the depths. Outside, an antidote that keeps the monkeys calm during yet another urination test is discovered: bananas. Back inside the park, Kyle reluctantly drinks a jarful of pee in preparation for his plunge into the flood. Just after he finishes the jar, helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission, which made Kyle extremely furious for drinking pee for nothing. After escaping the pee-filled water park, Cartman reunites with his friends, and is glad that he isn't the last of the species and he declares that he will live up to the fullest. Kyle angrily says that he has to get his stomach pumped at the hospital. Stan reassures that it's only a little pee. Kyle angrily complains that bananas are more disgusting than pee. The water tester doles out bananas to the kids. The fire marshal tells them that they <b>must</b> <b>eat</b> their bananas immediately, but a police officer aims his gun at Kyle, saying that he must do it, or he'll be put down and Kyle yells in frustration.|$|E

25|$|Breastfeeding {{is cheaper}} than alternatives, {{but is not}} free of cost. The mother {{generally}} <b>must</b> <b>eat</b> more food than otherwise. In the US, the extra money spent on food (about US$ each week) is usually about half {{as much money as}} the cost of infant formula.|$|E
25|$|Carnivore and {{herbivore}} diets are contrasting, {{with basic}} nitrogen and carbon proportions vary for their particular foods. Many herbivores rely on bacterial fermentation to create digestible nutrients from indigestible plant cellulose, while obligate carnivores <b>must</b> <b>eat</b> animal meats to obtain certain vitamins or nutrients their bodies cannot otherwise synthesize.|$|E

25|$|To {{meet all}} of their {{nutritional}} requirements cows <b>must</b> <b>eat</b> their entire ration. Unfortunately, much like humans, cattle have their favorite foods. To keep cattle from selectively eating the most desirable parts of the diet, most produces feed a total mixed ration (TMR). In this system all {{the components of the}} feed are well mixed in a mixing truck before being delivered to the cattle. Different TMRs are often prepared for groups of cows with different nutritional requirements.|$|E
25|$|M-1 {{joined the}} International People's Democratic Uhuru Movement in Chicago for three years, stic.man {{remained}} in Florida. Burned {{out by the}} arduous labor of Uhuru, M-1 and stic.man chose to focus on music. Brand Nubian's Lord Jamar discovered them in New York City and signed them a deal with Loud Records. Although dead prez was not always Loud's top priority, they built a fan base due to their over-the-top performances (they've been known to ignite dollar bills and toss apples into the audiences, declaring that they <b>must</b> <b>eat</b> healthily).|$|E
25|$|Once bonded, a {{male and}} female kiwi tend to live their entire lives as a monogamous couple. During the mating season, June to March, the pair call to each other at night, and meet in the nesting burrow every three days. These {{relationships}} may last for up to 20years. They are unusual among other birds in that, along with some raptors, they have a functioning pair of ovaries. (In most birds and in platypuses, the right ovary never matures, so that only the left is functional.) Kiwi eggs can weigh up to one-quarter {{the weight of the}} female. Usually, only one egg is laid per season. The kiwi lays the biggest egg in proportion to its size of any bird in the world, so even though the kiwi {{is about the size of}} a domestic chicken, it is able to lay eggs that are about six times the size of a chicken's egg. The eggs are smooth in texture, and are ivory or greenish white. The male incubates the egg, except for the great spotted kiwi, A. haastii, in which both parents are involved. The incubation period is 63–92days. Producing the huge egg places significant physiological stress on the female; for the thirty days it takes to grow the fully developed egg, the female <b>must</b> <b>eat</b> three times her normal amount of food. Two to three days before the egg is laid there is little space left inside the female for her stomach and she is forced to fast.|$|E

25|$|After being released, Danielson {{received}} several offers {{to sign with}} other wrestling companies, being contacted by TNA, albeit indirectly, and some Japanese promotions. Two weeks after his departure from WWE, Danielson made {{his return to the}} independent circuit on June 26, defeating Eddie Kingston at the CHIKARA event We <b>Must</b> <b>Eat</b> Michigan's Brain in Taylor, Michigan. Rather than receiving streamers, the fans instead threw neck ties in light of the Justin Roberts incident in WWE. The following day at CHIKARA's Faded Scars and Lines Danielson defeated Young Lions Cup holder Tim Donst in a non–title match. On July 3, Danielson returned to wXw, defeating Wade Fitzgerald and TJP in the round robin stage of the Ambition 1 tournament. The following day, he defeated Tommy End, TJP in a rematch, and finally Johnny Moss in the finals of the tournament to win Ambition 1. On July 17, Danielson debuted in the International Wrestling Association (IWA), being booked to defeat Q.T. Marshall for the IWA Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship. On July 23, Danielson debuted in the fledgling EVOLVE promotion, which was originally conceived to be built around Danielson as their top star before he signed to WWE. In the main event, he defeated Bobby Fish, while Danielson continued on undefeated the following day by returning to Dragon Gate USA, and submitted Shingo in the dark match main event Return of the Dragon. After the match, Danielson joined BxB Hulk, Masato Yoshino, Naruki Doi, and PAC as the fifth member of the stable World-1. On July 30, Danielson returned to Pro Wrestling Guerrilla, competing in a match where he defeated Roderick Strong. On August 7, Danielson unsuccessfully challenged Adam Pearce for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at the NWA Legends Fanfest.|$|E

Other Arab authors wrote that cubeb rendered the breath fragrant, cured affections of the bladder, and that eating it [...] "enhances the delight of coitus".|$|E

500|$|As {{with its}} predecessor, Ultima Underworld II was {{designed}} to generate emergent gameplay through the interplay of simulated systems. The developers attempted to combine role-playing elements with [...] "a sophisticated three-dimensional simulation of a sensible and believable world". For example, torches burn out, items wear over time and the player character <b>must</b> <b>eat.</b> Many items in the game are useless but were included {{for the sake of}} realism. The game is nonlinear, in that players must [...] "visit and revisit" [...] areas as the character gains abilities and becomes stronger, instead of [...] "clearing each square foot as they go". Many situations and puzzles in the game have multiple solutions.|$|E
500|$|The brief {{attempt to}} resettle Bikini from 1974 until 1978 was aborted when health {{problems}} from radioactivity {{in the food}} supply caused the atoll to be evacuated again. Sport divers who visit Bikini to dive on the shipwrecks <b>must</b> <b>eat</b> imported food. The local government elected to close the fly-in fly-out sports diving operation in Bikini lagoon in 2008, and the 2009 diving season was canceled due to fuel costs, unreliable airline service to the island, {{and a decline in}} the Bikini Islanders' trust fund which subsidized the operation. After a successful trial in October 2010, the local government licensed a sole provider of dive expeditions on the nuclear ghost fleet at Bikini Atoll starting in 2011. The aircraft carrier [...] is the primary attraction of a struggling, high-end sport diving industry.|$|E
500|$|The {{developers}} intended Ultima Underworld to be {{a realistic}} and interactive [...] "dungeon simulation", {{rather than a}} straightforward role-playing game. For example, many objects in the game have no actual use, while a lit torch may be used on corn to create popcorn. Weapons deteriorate with use, and the player character <b>must</b> <b>eat</b> and rest; light sources burn out unless extinguished before sleeping. A physics system allows, among other things, for items to bounce when thrown against surfaces. The game contains non-player characters (NPCs) with whom the player may interact by selecting dialogue choices from a menu. Most NPCs have possessions, {{and are willing to}} trade them. The game was designed to give players [...] "a palette of strategies" [...] with which to approach situations, and its simulation systems allow for emergent gameplay.|$|E
