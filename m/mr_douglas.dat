60|$|As {{they reached}} {{the bottom of the}} stairs he had seen <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Douglas</b> coming down it. No, she was not hurrying; it did not seem to him that she was {{particularly}} agitated.

6000|$|... "Your coming {{must have}} been rather a shock," [...] she {{reminded}} Beatrice. [...] "You came with the idea, did you not, that--you would find <b>Mr.</b> <b>Douglas</b> Romilly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we'll pass that, then," [...] he conceded. [...] "I haven't quite {{finished}} with you yet, though. There {{are just one}} or two more points I am going to put before you--and this gentleman who is not <b>Mr.</b> <b>Douglas</b> Romilly," [...] he added, with a little bow to Philip. [...] "The first is this. There is one fact which we can all three take for granted, because I know it--I can prove it a hundred times over--and you both know it; {{and that is that the}} Mr. Merton Ware of to-day travelled from Liverpool on the Elletania as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Douglas</b> Romilly, occupied a room at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Douglas</b> Romilly, and absconded from there, leaving his luggage and his identity behind him, to blossom out in an attic of the Monmouth tenement house as Mr. Merton Ware, a young writer of plays. Now I don't think," [...] Mr. Dane went on, leaning a little further over the table, [...] "that the <b>Mr.</b> <b>Douglas</b> Romilly who has disappeared was ever capable of writing a play. I don't think he was a man of talent at all. I don't think he could have written, for instance, 'The House of Shams.' Let us, however, leave the subject of Douglas Romilly for a moment. Let us go a little further back--to Detton Magna, let us say. Curiously enough, there was another young man who disappeared from that little Derbyshire village about the same time, who has never been heard of since. His name, too, was Romilly. I gathered, during the course of my recent enquiries, that he was a poor relation, a cousin of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Douglas</b> Romilly." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Douglas</b> gave {{a cry of}} astonishment at Holmes's words.

6000|$|... "Well, {{there seems}} to have been plenty of reason for <b>Mr.</b> <b>Douglas</b> Guest to have {{committed}} suicide, as I daresay you know, if ever you read the papers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{precisely}} that," [...] {{the detective}} replied. [...] "All that I discovered {{was that you}} were the man who registered at the Waldorf Hotel as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Douglas</b> Romilly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Out of the question, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Douglas.</b> Absolutely {{out of the}} question. You must go {{away for}} {{a year at the}} very least. You must yield {{something}} to propriety." ...|$|E

He is what is called here a [...] "laird," [...] a man of good family, a large landed proprietor, a zealous reformer, and a very devout man.|$|E

Well, he isn't <b>Mr.</b> <b>Douglas</b> Romilly, and that's all there is about it. As to my going out with him last evening, I can't see that that's any concern of any one. He was kind to me, cheered me up {{when he saw that}} I was disappointed; I told him my whole story and that I didn't know a soul in New York, and we became friends. That's all there is about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you. But what is {{the cause}} of all this gloomy cynicism, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Douglas?</b> Why should you, who are young, distinguished, gifted, and already famous, envy me for having no leisure to think?" ...|$|E
