40|$|This paper {{emphasizes}} {{concurrent consideration}} of the partitioning of a microelectronic circuit design into multiple dies and {{the selection of the}} appropriate packaging technology for implementation of the entire system. Partitioning a large design into a <b>multichip</b> <b>package</b> is a non-trivial task. Similarly, selection of the MCM packaging technology to accommodate a multichip solution can also be puzzling. The interdependencies of these two problems a ord the opportunity to achieve a global optimum when considered concurrently. In this paper we address the partitioning/MCM technology tradeo, their interdependency, and previous work in this area. The SUN MicroSparc CPU is used as a demonstration vehicle and is partitioned for di erent MCM technologies. The preliminary results show that the optimum number of partitions and contents of each partition depend heavily on the choice of MCM technologies for a given application. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} adjusting speeds of multiple computer processors, sharing the same thermal environment, such as a chip or <b>multichip</b> <b>package.</b> We assume that the speed of each processor (and associated variables such as power supply voltage) can be controlled, and we model the dissipated power of a processor as a positive and strictly increasing convex function of the speed. We show {{that the problem of}} processor speed control subject to thermal constraints for the environment is a convex optimization problem. We present an efficient infeasible-start primal-dual interior-point method for solving the problem. We also present a distributed method, using dual decomposition. Both of these approaches can be interpreted as nonlinear static control laws, which adjust the processor speeds based on the measured temperatures in the system. We give numerical examples to illustrate performance of the algorithms. Index Terms—Convex optimization, distributed control, primal-dual interior-point methods, temperature-aware processor control.

40|$|One of {{the main}} driving forces for the {{electronic}} market place has been the rapidly increasing power of central processing unit (CPU) and related component for personal computer (PC). The power being consumed by PC microprocessors have been steadily increasing from a few watts for X 386 to more than 35 watts for "Pentium". They are scheduled to reach over 100 watts {{within the next few}} years. These powerful chips are typically packaged in Pin or Ball-Grid-Array packages either in flip-chip or traditional die-attach modes. The thermal management is extremely challenging for both inside and outside of the package. This paper will compare some of todays solutions and interface materials in terms of performance, manufacturability and long-term reliability. 1. OVERVIEW While most of the microprocessors made by Intel today are still in the traditional wire-bond, pin-grid-array <b>multichip</b> <b>packages,</b> AMD, Cyrix-National and LSI Logic have already used flip-chip packages. The thermal management of these single chip and <b>multichip</b> <b>packages</b> involves several levels of thermal interfacing. Figure 1 is a schematic representation of typical requirements...|$|R

Recent industry trends {{have moved to}} an ever increasing adoption of polymer materials as the packaging material of choice for a varietyof applications ranging from interlayer dielectrics, to passivation layers, to die attach adhesives, to chip encapsulants (both molding and adhesive) and underfill materials to name a few. Most chips are packaged as single chips today. However {{to the extent that}} applications requiring advanced high-density chips are more in demand, <b>multichip</b> <b>packages</b> (or modules, MCMs) are becoming preferred since they decrease the wiring distance between chips by packaging the chips as close together as possible to reduce the propagation delay and increase the packaging interconnect wiring.

40|$|Abstract. The first {{prototype}} of the free-space accelerator for switching terabit networks (FAST-Net) program is described. The optical interconnection module consists of an array of matched high-resolution, wide-angle (f / 1. 1) imaging lenses that effect a global point-to-point shuffle link pattern across a multichip smart pixel array. A mirror is used to fold the shuffled links back onto the array to facilitate single-plane <b>multichip</b> <b>packaging</b> and simplified opto-mechanical alignment. The test system incorporates several monolithically integrated two-dimensional arrays of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) and photodetectors (PDs) in the multichip plane. In initial experiments the prototype showed good overall optical efficiency and sufficient channel separation for VCSEL/PD arrays with pitches as small as 100 µm. These results suggest that high bisection bandwidth optical free-space interconnection fabrics are feasible for high-throughput switching and multiprocessor applications...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{there is}} a growing demand to have smaller and lighter {{electronic}} circuits which have greater complexity, multifunctionality, and reliability. High-density <b>multichip</b> <b>packaging</b> technology has been used in order to meet these requirements. The higher the density scale is, the larger the power dissipation per unit area becomes. Therefore, in the designing process, it has become very important to carry out the thermal analysis. However, the heat transport model in multichip modules is very complex, and its treatment is tedious and time consuming. This paper describes an application of the thermal network method to the transient thermal analysis of multichip modules and proposes a simple model for the thermal analysis of multichip modules as a preliminary thermal design tool. On the basis of the result of transient thermal analysis, the validity of the thermal network method and the simple thermal analysis model is confirmed...|$|R
40|$|The work {{described}} in this paper was carried out as an ESTEC Development Contract to study die attachment, wire bonding and packaging of gallium arsenide devices. A low mass and volume hermetic package suitable for single or <b>multichip</b> <b>packaging</b> was identified, and the mounting and wire bonding carried out within this package. The obiective of this work was to evaluate conductive epoxy resin die mounting and lid sealing, compare it with eutectic methods and to find if reliable thermosonic bonds {{could be made to}} devices without damaging the underlying material. All test pieces were subjected to long term high temperature storage, environmental or mechanical stress. Bond strengths and visual appearance were examined before and after stress testing together with particular requirements such as hermeticity of sealed packages.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel silicon micromachining method, which combines tetra methyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) etching and deep-reactive ion etching (DRIE) along with bottom-up copper electroplating, to fabricate high-density and high-aspect ratio through-wafer electrical interconnects (TWEIs) for three-dimensional <b>multichip</b> <b>packaging.</b> The silicon wafer was locally etched with TMAH from the backside until the desired membrane thickness was reached, and then DRIE {{was performed on}} the membrane until the holes were etched through. TMAH etching preserved large areas of the wafers at the original thick-ness, thus, ensuring relatively strong mechanical strength and manipulability. DRIE made it possible to realize high-aspect ratio holes with minimized wafer area consumption. A new bottom-up copper electroplating technique was developed to fill the high-as-pect ratio through-wafer holes. This method can avoid seams and voids while achieving attractive electrical features. Through-wafer holes, as small as 5 m in diameter, have been realized by using the combination of TMAH and DRIE, and have been completely and uniformly filled by using bottom-up copper electroplating.

40|$|Welcome {{to the new}} {{electronic}} {{plastic packaging}} paradigm! Several circumstances could help drive the component packaging industry to modern materials and processes. Most do not realize that our “modern ” plastic packages use very old materials and processes that have been pushed to their limits by increasing performance demands. After more than 50 years of epoxy resins and transfer molding, events are unfolding that open up opportunities for high-performance thermoplastics and automatic injection molding. Thermoplastics not only have superior properties, they’re halogen-free and can be completely recycled. But more motivating is the versatility of thermoplastic molding that can readily produce low cost cavity packages suitable for MEMS and MOEMS. Complex designs can also be manufactured without added cost and this includes <b>multichip</b> <b>packages.</b> Even 3 D stacked and “stackable” packages can be injection molded using high volume processes; tooling determines the part complexity. Plastics, such as LCP, withstand soldering temperatures of lead-free alloys, but lids can be heat-sealed using an IR laser in an efficient process requiring no adhesives. This paper will describe the driving forces for change. The old and new package technologies will be compared {{and the status of}} thermoplastic packaging discussed. Package concepts and processes will be presented with test results and data. Key words: packaging, thermoplastic, MEMS, BG...|$|R

40|$|Increased {{demands for}} small circuit feature sizes have {{provided}} incentives {{to the development}} of new photoformable thick film compositions. Previously the limited applicability of such materials meant that only gold (Au) and in some cases silver (Ag) based compositions were developed. Now, with strong interest being shown by automotive and wireless markets coupled with those who want to replace thin film with a lower cost process, activity in photoformable materials development has become very significant and the definition of what is needed and its priorities are becoming clearer. This paper describes the characteristics of some newly developed photoformable materials, including Au, Ag, and Ag-Pt (platinum) conductors, capable of 30 mm lines on a 60 mm pitch, a robust Ag compatible dielectric material, based on QM 44 technology, capable of forming vias as small as 50 mm on a 100 mm pitch, and blendable low ohm resistors also capable of very small sizes (50 mm* 50 mm). These materials have application {{in a wide variety of}} high density interconnect circuits, including automotive ECU’s, bump-on-via <b>multichip</b> <b>packages</b> and 50 W transmission lines in wireless applications. Details of the properties, capabilities and processing of the materials are discussed. Future planned developments for photoformable compositions over the next few years are also outlined and presented in the form of a roadmap.

40|$|A highly {{integrated}} millimeter wave {{active antenna}} array is implemented using a novel <b>multichip</b> <b>packaging</b> technique. The {{goal of the}} new packaging scheme is to allow the implementation of very compact hybrid multi-chip modules using a low cost micro-machined silicon motherboard and benzocyclobutene (BCB) films. The excellent planarity of BCB allows interlayer connections to be formed using bumps fabricated prior to BCB application. This approach {{eliminates the need for}} laser drilling, plasma etching, and plated holes. ^ The effects of the packaging on the electrical performance of active devices and passive structures are studied. Several representative GaAs pHEMTs are packaged using this technique. Measurements show minimal performance degradation from 1 GHz to 48 GHz. Passive MMIC structures are also studied and small but significant degradation is reported. The interconnection discontinuities formed by the package are studied in detail and lumped circuit models are generated. The performance of these discontinuities as a function of variations in the fabrication process is analyzed. Relatively small changes are noted. This is a major advantage when compared to other interconnection techniques such as bond wires. ^ The design and measurements of an LNA and mixer MMIC for LMDS applications are presented. The LNA consists of four cascaded stages and the mixer designed is a second harmonic anti-parallel diode configuration. The MMIC is packaged and its performance is characterized. ^ An antenna architecture compatible with the developed package is proposed. The implementation of active antenna arrays with the presented package scheme is difficult due {{to the size of the}} active circuitry. This creates array radiation patterns with large side lobes. Several configurations that reduce this problem are investigated. One array has been fabricated and its measured performance analyzed. ^ Finally, a highly integrated active antenna array module is presented. The module consists of a 1 x 4 antenna sub-array and a MMIC with an integrated LNA and mixer. This module is extremely compact with a size of only 1. 4 x 1. 1 cm. Its performance is characterized and a loss budget presented. ...|$|R

The present ground system of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is costly to operate, maintain, deploy, reproduce, and document. In the present climate of shrinking NASA budgets, this proposed architecture takes on added importance as it will dramatically reduce {{all of the above}} costs. Currently, the ground support functions (i. e., receiver, tracking, ranging, telemetry, command, monitor and control) are distributed among several subsystems that are housed in individual rack-mounted chassis. These subsystems can be integrated into one portable laptop system using established <b>MultiChip</b> Module (MCM) <b>packaging</b> technology. The large scale integration of subsystems into a small portable system will greatly reduce operations, maintenance and reproduction costs. Several of the subsystems can be implemented using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products further decreasing non-recurring engineering costs. The inherent portability of the system will open up new ways for using the ground system at the “point-of-use” site as opposed to maintaining several large centralized stations. This eliminates the propagation delay of the data to the Principal Investigator (PI), enabling the capture of data in real-time and performing multiple tasks concurrently from any location in the world. Sample applications are to use the portable ground system in remote areas or mobile vessels for real-time correlation of satellite data with earth-bound instruments; thus, allowing near real-time feedback and control of scientific instruments.
