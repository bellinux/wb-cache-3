40|$|There {{is little}} {{information}} on nickel adsorption by Brazilian soils.

Soil samples were collected from the 0 - 0. 2 m layer and treated to eliminate organic <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> iron oxides. The nickel adsorption was evaluated in the original samples and in those treated to remove organic <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> to remove both, organic <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> iron oxides, using 2 g soil + 20 mL of 0. 01 mol L- 1 CaCl 2 solution containing 5 mg L- 1 Ni, pH varying from 3. 5 to 7. 5. The nickel adsorption decreased with the elimination of organic matter. For the samples without organic <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> iron oxides, adsorption decreased only in the Anionic "Rhodic" Acrudox. The pH was the main factor involved in nickel adsorption variation, and for soil samples without organic <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> iron oxides, the maximum adsorption occurred at higher pH values...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{evolution}} of galaxies is by the incompatibility between dark <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> baryonic <b>matter.</b> Due to the structural difference, baryonic <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> dark <b>matter</b> are incompatible {{to each other as}} oil droplet and water in emulsion. In the interfacial zone between dark <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> baryonic <b>matter,</b> this incompatibility generates the modification of Newtonian dynamics to keep dark <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> baryonic <b>matter</b> apart. The five periods of baryonic structure development in the order of increasing incompatibility are the free baryonic matter, the baryonic droplet, the galaxy, the cluster, and the supercluster periods. The transition to the baryonic droplet generates density perturbation in the CMB. In the galaxy period, the first-generation galaxies include elliptical, normal spiral, barred spiral, irregular, and dwarf spheroidal galaxies. In the cluster period, the second-generation galaxies include modified giant ellipticals, cD, evolved S 0, dwarf elliptical, BCD, and tidal dwarf galaxies. The whole observable expanding universe behaves as one unit of emulsion with increasing incompatibility between dark <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> baryonic <b>matter.</b> The properties of dark <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> baryonic <b>matter</b> are based on cosmology derived from the two physical structures: the space structure and the object structure. Baryonic matter can be described by the periodic table of elementary particles. Comment: 43 pages, 13 figures, 2 table...|$|R
