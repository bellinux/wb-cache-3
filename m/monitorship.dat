40|$|When {{a sexual}} abuse scandal rocked Penn State, when Apple engaged in anticompetitive behavior, and when servicers like Bank of America {{improperly}} foreclosed upon {{hundreds of thousands}} of homeowners, each organization entered into a Modern-Day <b>Monitorship.</b> Modern-Day Monitorships are utilized in an array of contexts to assist in widely varying remediation efforts. They provide outsiders a unique source of information about the efficacy of the tarnished organization’s efforts to remediate misconduct. Yet despite their use in high-profile and serious matters of organizational wrongdoing, they are not an outgrowth of careful study and deliberate planning. Instead, Modern-Day Monitorships have been employed in an ad-hoc and reactionary manner, which has resulted in repeated instances of controversy and calls for reform by scholars and legislators. Accompanying these calls for reform has been an implicit assumption that all monitorships are made equal; that broad-based rules could effectively regulate all monitorships. Yet, when tested, this assumption is found lacking. This Article traces the rise of the Modern-Day <b>Monitorship</b> and, for the first time, analyzes the use of monitorships in five different contexts. The analysis demonstrates that Modern-Day Monitorships have experienced a rapid evolution with important consequences. First, as demonstrated by the Apple <b>monitorship,</b> the evolution has changed the manner in which courts and lawyers conceive of the appropriate boundaries and norms for court-ordered monitorships. Second, as demonstrated by the Penn State scandal, private organizations are coopting the use of monitorships, which may be transforming the nature of monitorships from one of a quasi-government enforcement mechanism to what looks like a privatized tool of reputation remediation. Third, monitorships fall into different categories based on the type of remediation effort the <b>monitorship</b> is meant to achieve. Because these different categories necessitate different <b>monitorship</b> structures, attempts to adopt universal rules governing monitorships may be misguided. In short, differences matter when evaluating monitorships. This Article’s analysis will assist policymakers and scholars engaged in efforts targeted at analyzing, reforming, or regulating monitorships...|$|E

Based on our interviews with corporate monitors, regulators, {{and others in the}} United States and Canada, we identify the ways in which these monitorships in practice fall substantially short of the ideal new governance model we describe. These failings are not necessarily due to the adversarial nature of the enforcement context, which some argue makes this context inhospitable to new governance reform efforts. Instead, we identify a set of micro-sociological characteristics inherent in the prosecutorial and <b>monitorship</b> environment that can push many monitorships to favor the status quo and to be under-ambitious.

40|$|Monitors oversee {{remediation}} {{efforts at}} dozens, if not hundreds, of {{institutions that are}} guilty of misconduct. The remediation efforts that the monitors of today engage in are, in many instances, quite similar to activities that were once subject to formal court oversight. But as the importance and power of monitors has increased, the court’s oversight of monitors and the agreements that most often result in monitorships has, at best, been severely diminished and, at worst, vanished altogether. Additionally, statutory efforts to provide formal guidance and restrictions on monitorships have stalled and published bar guidance has taken a nonbinding advisory form. Finally, the evolution of monitorships has resulted in monitors appointed in untraditional circumstances, without the typical involvement of regulatory actors who can serve as an additional check to ensure appropriate monitor behavior. As a result, a monitor is often charged with overseeing an institution’s effort to address misconduct within its walls, while the monitor herself acts without formal oversight or technical restraint. The lack of regulation governing monitors is well documented; yet, the academic literature on monitorships to date has largely taken the state of <b>monitorship</b> regulation as a given and failed to explain adequately why monitors, who often are technical members of regulated professions, {{are not subject to}} professional regulation. This Article argues that one reason for the lack of regulation governing monitorships is the resistance of the bar to regulate quasi-legal positions undertaken by lawyers. Instead, the primary restraint on a monitor’s behavior is the monitor’s own interest in her reputation. This has resulted in monitoring roles undertaken by lawyers who are acting {{in a manner that is}} not subject to formal professional standards and by non-lawyers who have no mechanisms of constraint on their behavior. Consequently, several areas of concern for monitorships need careful study and attention in an attempt to achieve some semblance of legitimacy and standards for monitors and monitorships. Specifically, more research is needed to determine appropriate norms regarding (i) a monitor’s disclosure of information, (ii) how to facilitate monitor independence, and (iii) potential methods for utilizing personal responsibility as a mechanism of sanctioning a monitor for inappropriate conduct...|$|E

MÉTODOS: estudo quase-experimental, aninhado a uma coorte. A pesquisa contou com dois componentes: triagem hospitalar e acompanhamento domiciliar de um mês (30 %); foram acompanhados 973 pares mãe-bebê de uma amostra inicial de 2741 mães. RESULTADOS nascer em hospitais que não adotam a IHAC aumentou o risco das mães não terem sido incentivadas para o aleitamento, dos bebês não mamarem na primeira hora e receberem chupeta e chá no hospital. A prevalência de aleitamento exclusivo com um mês foi de 60 %. As crianças nascidas no hospital IHAC tiveram maior índice de aleitamento exclusivo com um mês e o uso de chupeta mostrou uma associação negativa com o desfecho. CONCLUSÕES: a intervenção foi positiva e o impacto seria maior se a implantação dos "dez passos" fosse total, na coleta de dados.

Para fundamentar teórico-filosófica e metodologicamente este estudo, usei a Teoria da Atividade Sócio-Histórico-Cultural (LEONTIEV, 1978; ENGESTRÖM, 1999; VYGOTSKY, 1930 / 1998 e 1934 / 1999), na perspectiva dialógica da linguagem (BAKHTIN, 1929 / 1999), para entender como os sujeitos constroem conhecimentos por meio de suas ações, nos sistemas de atividades. A teoria da atividade possibilitou entender, a partir da mediação pela linguagem, a relação entre o sujeito da atividade e seu objeto / objetivo. A análise do desenvolvimento e engajamento interacional da professora-pesquisadora e do aluno-monitor foi realizada com base na concepção de ciclo expansivo de aprendizagem (ENGESTRÖM, 1999), segundo o qual desenvolver significa resolver ou transformar as contradições / problemas existentes, para obter como resultado uma mudança no sistema de atividade com foco na construção de novo objeto e de novo(s) motivo(s) e, por conseguinte, a ressignificação dos sujeitos da atividade. Esta pesquisa foi realizada em uma Instituição de Ensino Superior, na região da Grande São Paulo (Taboão da Serra), envolvendo professora-pesquisadora e aluno-monitor. Os dados foram coletados durante o segundo semestre de 2007, de agosto a dezembro. A metodologia adotada é a pesquisa crítica de colaboração (MAGALHÃES, 2006), que tem como propósito a análise das práticas realizadas para transformar as ações de maneira crítica e colaborativa. As contribuições desta pesquisa podem ser diversas, especialmente no contexto de formação de professores de língua estrangeira pré-serviço. Tais contribuições incluem repensar quem é o professor que queremos / precisamos formar, tomando como base o fato de que a formação envolve competências linguísticas, didáticas e o desenvolvimento de uma consciência crítica e reflexiva, na conjunção entre teoria e práticaThe research aims at investigating how senses-and-meanings {{are built}} in the interactions between teacher-researcher and student-monitor {{about what it is}} to be a teacher and also about teaching-learning a foreign language, during the planning and development of a <b>monitorship</b> project. The theoretical, philosophical and methodological background that supports this research is the Activity Theory (LEONTIEV, 1978; ENGESTRÖM, 1999; VYGOTSKY, 1930 / 1998 e 1934 / 1999) and also the dialogical perspective of language (BAKHTIN, 1929 / 1999) in order to understand how subjects build and produce knowledge through their actions, in activity systems. Activity theory made it to possible to understand the subject-object relation, mediated mainly through language. The analysis on developmental and interactional engagement between teacher-researcher and student-monitor was based on the expansive learning cycle conception (ENGESTRÖM, 1999) that states that developing means solving or transforming the existing contradictions/problems, and consequently it results in changes in the activity system: the building of a new object and new motive(s), therefore creating new senses-and-meaning to the subject of the activity. This research was carried out in a private teaching institution, situated in the outskirts of Sao Paulo, in a city called Taboão da Serra, the main subjects are the teacher-researcher and the student-monitor. Data were collected during the second semester of 2007, from August to December. The methodological frame is Critical Research of Collaboration (MAGALHÃES, 2006) whose purpose is to analyze the accomplished practices in order to transform actions with a critical and collaborative dimension.
