40|$|For {{predicting}} the environmental {{fate of a}} chemical a knowledge of its biodegradability is essential. Several kinds of tests, standardized by the OECD and EEC for the determination of ultimate biodegradability (mineralization), are available. The degradation is determined by nonspecific analyses such as the measurement of DOC (e. g. modified OECD screening test), microbial oxygen uptake (modified MITI test; <b>manometric</b> <b>respirometry</b> <b>test)</b> or the microbial release of COsub 2 (modified Sturm test). For testing the biodegradability of two stroke engine oils a special test {{was developed by the}} CEC (Co-Ordination European Council) : the CEC L- 33 -T- 82. In this test the criterion for biodegradability is the elimination of the characteristic CHsub 3 CHsub 2 - groups as determined by IR-spectroscopy. Comparative studies with three synthetic lubricant base stocks revealed that significant differences may occur for this substance class. The degradation of the three substances was 100 percent in the CEC-te st, whereas in the <b>manometric</b> <b>respirometry</b> <b>test</b> degradation levels below 40 percent were obtained; in the modified Sturm test the degradation was between 44 and 85 percent. In the <b>manometric</b> <b>respirometry</b> <b>test</b> no substance fulfilled the criterion of ready biodegradability, whereas all three substances reached the pass level in the CEC- test. Results obtained in the CEC-test and in mineralization tests should be in good agreement when no significant formation of microbial biomass and no formation of hydrophilic metabolites takes place. Both parameter contribute to a high percentage of biodegradation in the CEC-test, but low apparent biodegradability in tests for ultimate biodegradability...|$|E
40|$|Biodegradation tests {{according}} to Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development standard 301 F (<b>manometric</b> <b>respirometry</b> <b>test)</b> with technical iminodisuccinate (IDS) revealed ready biodegradability for all stereoisomers of IDS. The IDS-degrading strain Agrobacterium tumefaciens BY 6 was isolated from activated sludge. The strain {{was able to}} grow on each IDS isomer {{as well as on}} Fe 2 +-, Mg 2 +-, and Ca 2 +-IDS complexes as the sole carbon, nitrogen, and energy source. In contrast, biodegradation of and growth on Mn 2 +-IDS were rather scant and very slow on Cu 2 +-IDS. Growth and turnover experiments with A. tumefaciens BY 6 indicated that the isomer R,S-IDS is the preferred substrate. The IDS-degrading enzyme system isolated from this organism consists of an IDS-epimerase and a C-N lyase. The C-N lyase is stereospecific for the cleavage of R,S-IDS, generating d-aspartic acid and fumaric acid. The decisive enzyme for S,S-IDS and R,R-IDS degradation is the epimerase. It transforms S,S-IDS and R,R-IDS into R,S-IDS. Both enzymes do not require any cofactors. The two enzymes were purified and characterized, and the N-termini were sequenced. The purified lyase and also the epimerase catalyzed the transformation of alkaline earth metal-IDS complexes, while heavy metal-IDS complexes were transformed rather slowly or not at all. The observed mechanism for the complete mineralization of all IDS isomers involving an epimerase offers an interesting possibility of funneling all stereoisomers into a catabolic pathway initiated by a stereoselective lyase...|$|E
40|$|The {{biodegradability}} {{of several}} potential endocrine disrupting compounds, namely 4 -n-nonylphenol (4 -n-NP), nonylphenol monoethoxylate (NP 1 EO), nonylphenol diethoxylate (NP 2 EO), bisphenol A (BPA), triclosan (TCS), di-(2 -ethylhexyl) -phthalate (DEHP), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorononanoate (PFNA) was evaluated in this study, using OECD method 301 F (<b>manometric</b> <b>respirometry</b> <b>test)</b> and activated sludge as inoculum. According to the results, 4 -n-NP and BPA meet the strict definition of ready biodegradability {{and they are}} not expected to be persistent during the activated sludge process. Partial biodegradation was observed for DEHP (58. 7 +/- 5. 7 %, n = 3). TCS (52. 1 +/- 8. 5 %, n = 3) and NP 1 EO (25. 9 +/- 8. 1 %, n = 3), indicating their possible biodegradation in wastewater treatment systems, while no biodegradation was observed for NP 2 EO, PFOA and PFNA. Experiments in the co-presence of a readily biodegradable compound showed the absence of co-metabolic phenomena during 4 -n-NP, BPA and TCS biodegradation. Using first order kinetics to describe biodegradation of the target compounds, half-lives of 4. 3 +/- 0. 6, 1. 3 +/- 0. 2, 1. 8 +/- 0. 5, 6. 9 +/- 2. 6 days were calculated for 4 -n-NP, BPA, TCS and DEHP, respectively. Toxicity tests using marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri showed that biodegradation of 4 -n-NP, NP 1 EO, BPA and TCS is a simultaneous detoxification process, while possible abiotic or biotic transformations of NP 2 EO, DEHP, PFOA and PFNA during respirometric test resulted to significant increase of their toxicities.

"May 2011 "[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Algae have received increasing attention as a potential renewable source due to ease of biomass culture, fast growth rate, high biomass productivity, CO 2 fixation and O 2 production. For massive algal production algal kinetic parameters should be carefully determined and monitored. This study was aimed to explore the potential of using respirometry to rapidly measure algal growth kinetics. Compared to the standard batch growth study that lasts for more than 10 days, algal growth kinetics could be determined within a few hours. For the mixed algal the specific growth rates were 0. 35 ± 0. 02 d- 1 and 0. 62 ± 0. 02 d- 1 from the standard batch and <b>respirometry</b> <b>tests,</b> respectively. For Chlorella vulgaris, these values were 0. 45 ± 0. 02 and 0. 65 ± 0. 02 from the standard batch and <b>respirometry</b> <b>tests,</b> respectively. In addition to the specific growth rate calculation, the effects of different factors such as pH, bicarbonate, organic carbon sources (e. g. glucose) and toxicants (e. g. Cu 2 +) on algal growth were investigated by respirometry. pH range from 7 to 9 appeared to have no impact on algal growth. The half saturation constant (Ks) values for Chlorella vulgaris and mixed algal species were 0. 3 and 0. 7 mg/L with μmax of 0. 9 and 0. 68 d- 1, respectively. Both algal cultures maintained their maximum growth rate at the NaHCO 3 concentration of 1500 mg/L, indicating that algae can effectively grow under a broad range of CO 2 concentrations. The presence of glucose resulted in a decrease of the specific oxygen production rate for both Chlorella vulgaris and mixed algal species but each culture behaved differently in response to increasing glucose concentrations from 0. 1 to 1. 6 g/L. The decrease was not due to the presence of low concentrations of bacteria in the algal cultures. Bacterial cell numbers in the Chlorella vulgaris and mixed algal culture were 3. 6 × 104 and 1. 3 × 103 CFU/mL, respectively. Cupric ions have been used as a common algaecide. Short-term algal toxicity tests indicate that the growth of Chlorella vulgaris and the mixed algal species was not affected at 0. 4 mg/L Cu 2 +. However, as the Cu 2 + concentration increased, significant algal growth inhibition was observed...|$|R

In this study, four enzymes (β-glucanase, α-amylase, lipase and protease) were tested separately and {{in combination with the}} quaternary ammonium compound cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) to control flow-generated biofilms of Pseudomonas fluorescens. The four enzymes caused modest reduction of biofilm colony forming units (CFU). Protease, β-glucanase and α-amylase also caused modest biofilm removal. CTAB combined with either β-glucanase or α-amylase increased biofilm removal. Its combination with either β-glucanase or protease increased CFU reduction. However, CTAB−protease combination was antagonist in biofilm removal. Long-term effects in biofilm mass reduction were observed after protease exposure. In contrast, biofilms treated with β-glucanase were able to regrowth significantly after exposure. Moreover, short-term <b>respirometry</b> <b>tests</b> with planktonic cells were performed to understand the effects of enzymes and their combination with CTAB on P. fluorescens viability. Protease and lipase demonstrated antimicrobial action, while α-amylase increased bacterial metabolic activity. The combination of CTAB with either protease or α-amylase was antagonistic, decreasing the antimicrobial action of CTAB. The overall results demonstrate a modest effect of the selected enzymes in biofilm control, either when applied alone or each one in combination with CTAB. Total biofilm removal or CFU reduction was not achieved and, in some cases, the use of enzymes antagonized the effects of CTAB.

The overall objectives of this research were {{to contribute to a}} regenerable closed-loop system for food production and water, air and waste treatment, while also minimizing the mass, volume, power, cooling and labor needs of the overall system. Biological treatment becomes more feasible due to resupply constraints with longer utilization scenarios. Though designed for long-term space mission application, this research has application for waste treatment in any closed-loop ecosystem, (e. g. arctic regions, deep-sea exploration, etc.), and valuable insight was gained that will enhance knowledge on aerobic thermophilic digestion for municipal waste and wastewater treatment. Goals included volume reduction of the wastes, enhancing potential for resource recovery including carbon, water and nutrients, and pathogen inactivation. Advantages of the system include reduced retention time, increased rapid pathogen inactivation, lower reactor volume requirements, and ease of automation as compared to other biological waste treatment systems. ^ The primary research objectives of this research included the evaluation of the system, including effects of influent solids loadings, hydraulic retention time, oxygen transfer, and operational parameters such as pH, ORP, and temperature. Solids degradation levels of 74 - 78 % and lignin degradation rates of 81 % were consistently achieved. Nitrogen dynamics during treatment were discussed, and evaluation of start-up of the system was completed including utilization of pH adjustment during the first day to shorten the time required for attaining stable cycling. Start-up parameters were evaluated in transition to stable cycling, including volatile fatty acids, alkalinity, pH, and total ammonia nitrogen. Stable cycling conditions were forced using pH adjustments, shortening the time requirement to approximately 3 - 4 days compared to 1 month required for typical field start-ups. Enzyme activity evolution during start-up of the reactor was also evaluated. A component matrix analysis (influent feedstock, effluent, effluent filtrate, solids from filtrate, water) was completed including <b>respirometry</b> <b>testing,</b> relative enzyme activity response, lignin degradation, and total solids degradation.

40|$|Industrial plants pay {{disposal}} costs for discharging their wastewater that can contain pollutants, toxic organics and inorganics, to the sewer {{based on the}} Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) or Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of the streams. It has become increasingly expensive for industry to meet stringent regulatory standards. One solution to reduce this cost is to anaerobically degrade the COD content, which in turn generates useful methane gas {{that can be used}} to generate useful energy or heat. Anaerobic Digestion (AD) is one of the most suitable renewable resources of conversion of industrial wastewaters to bioenergy, but it is not widely utilized in the US. As a result, this research focused on understanding and improving fundamental technical and economic obstacles such as long residence times, large reactor sizes/footprints and product quality that hamper its industrial applications in the US. Kinetic modeling of these anaerobic digestion processes is important for evaluating experimental results, predicting performance, and optimizing reactor designs, but the modeling can be especially difficult for complex wastewater compositions. <b>Respirometry</b> <b>tests</b> were first conducted to assess the impact of substrate loading on kinetic parameters during AD of three industrial/agricultural wastewaters: soybean processing WW, brewery WW, and recycled beverage WW. Results showed that the rate order statistically increased with increasing initial COD content, demonstrating that conventional kinetic modeling is inadequate for these WW of complex composition. COD degradation models revealed the Monod model gave the best overall fit to experimental data throughout the duration of the AD process, but the reactions were best fit to first-order kinetics during the first 7 - 9 hours and then best fit to higher order kinetics after about 8 - 13 hours depending on initial COD load. Expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactors are two-stage continuous systems developed to reduce the residence time and footprint by expanding the sludge bed and escalating hydraulic mixing. However, higher molecular weight and slowly degrading organics, such as crude proteins and fats, cannot efficiently diffuse into the granular biomass to be digested before exiting the reactor, which limits AD efficiency. COD removal efficiency increased by up to 42 % and biogas production rate by up to 32 % for equivalent organic loading rates by properly manipulating COD load and feed rate. Hydrogen gas, an intermediate product generated during stage-one pre-acidification (PA), escapes the PA tank but theoretically can be captured and sent to the second stage EGSB reactor to enhance the biogas quality by biologically converting the carbon dioxide to methane. Introducing supplemental hydrogen gas in amounts less than theoretically generated in the PA tank increased energy yield by up to 42 % and enhanced biogas quality by up to 20 %. In addition, COD removal efficiency remained constant at ~ 98 %, indicating that hydrogen injection did not negatively affect overall substrate removal...|$|R

O conhecimento de seus distintos componentes, explicando a influência que as práticas de manejo exercem sobre a MO e a agregação dos solos, é de grande importância para a sustentabilidade dos sistemas agrícolas. Neste trabalho, avaliaram-se as substâncias húmicas, a atividade microbiana e o C orgânico lábil em agregados de um Latossolo Vermelho distrófico de Minas Gerais sob vegetação natural de Cerradão e sob cultivo convencional com milho durante 30 anos. Para isso, foram retiradas amostras de solo nas profundidades de 5 - 10 e 15 - 20 cm em quatro pontos diferentes. Após coletado, o {{material}} foi seco ao ar e fracionado, por via seca, nas classes de agregados de: 4, 75 - 2, 0; 2, 0 - 1, 0; 1, 0 - 0, 5; 0, 5 - 0, 25; 0, 25 - 0, 105; e Organic {{matter is}} {{an indicator of}} the soil quality. Knowledge about its different components, explaining the influence of management practices on organic matter and soil aggregation, is essential for the sustainability of agricultural systems. In the present work, we evaluated humic substances, microbial activity and labile organic carbon in a Dystrophic Red Latosol from Minas Gerais state, Brazil, under natural vegetation (Cerradão) or under 30 -years of conventional corn cultivation. Soil samples were collected from depths of 5 - 10 and 15 - 20 cm at four different sites. Then the samples were dried and fractioned in aggregate classes (diameter 4. 75 - 2. 0; 2. 0 - 1. 0; 1. 0 - 0. 5; 0. 5 - 0. 25; 0. 25 - 0. 105; and less than 0. 105 mm). Furthermore, organic carbon of fulvic acid (AF), humic acids (AH) and humins (HUM) fractions, and labile organic carbon (COL) using KMnO 4 15. 6 and 33. 0 mmol L- 1 of the samples were determined. The material was further subjected to a <b>respirometry</b> <b>test,</b> in which CO 2 production values were adjusted to logistic equations [Y = a/ 1 + e-(b + cx) ] to estimate the time needed to achieve half of the maximum CO 2 (t 1 / 2), production. Results showed higher mean organic carbon contents in the AH fraction and COL with KMnO 4 33. 0 mmol L- 1 of soil aggregates under conventional tillage. For AF and HUM fractions and COL with KMnO 4 15. 6 mmol L- 1 this behavior was only observed in the 15 - 20 cm layer. The highest CO 2 production was observed in the aggregates of the soil under Cerradão. The smaller aggregates tended to present higher organic carbon contents in the AF and AH fractions and COL. These were responsible for the highest CO 2 production and constituted favorable sites of organic matter storage, due to the physical and chemical protection, as well as for mineralization, since microorganisms prefer these sites. The coefficients of the logistic equation (a, b, c) and the t 1 / 2 can be considered important indicators of organic matter quality and lability under different managements...|$|R
40|$|The average global {{temperature}} {{is predicted to}} increase by 3 °C {{by the end of}} this century due to human-induced climate change. The overall metabolism of the aquatic biota will be directly affected by rising temperatures and associated changes. Since thermal stability is a characteristic of groundwater ecosystems, global warming is expected to have a profound effect on the groundwater fauna. The prediction that stygobitic (obligate groundwater dweller) species are vulnerable to climate change includes assumptions about metabolic effects that can only be tested by comparisons across a thermal gradient. To this end, we investigated the effects of two different thermal regimes on the metabolism of the stygobitic copepod species Diacyclops belgicus (Kiefer, 1936). We measured the individual-based oxygen consumption of this species as a proxy of possible metabolic reactions to temperature rising from 14 to 17 °C. We used a sealed glass microplate equipped with planar oxygen sensor spots with optical isolation glued onto the bottom of 80 -μL wells integrated with a 24 -channel fluorescence-based <b>respirometry</b> system. The <b>tests</b> have provided controversial results according to which the D. belgicus populations should be prudently considered at risk under a global warming scenario...|$|R
40|$|The {{biodegradability}} of leachate {{from the}} land treatment of hydrocarbon-contaminated soil was investigated in the laboratory using <b>respirometry</b> and toxicity <b>testing</b> in combination with total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) measurements. Soil in land treatment units (LTU) had been contaminated with a diesel-like hydrocarbon mixture formerly used as a diluent for crude oil at an oil field in California. Leachate was collected from two different LTUs for treatability testing in a respirometer under aerobic conditions. Only about 12 % reduction in TPH concentration was observed after aeration for 161 days, indicating limited biodegradability of the hydrocarbon constituents in the leachate. Similarly, Microtox® toxicity did not change after 130 days. Leachate biodegradability was further tested by comparison to diluent-contaminated groundwater from the same site. Leachate diluted to the same TPH concentration as the contaminated groundwater was three times less toxic, but was much less biodegradable. The recalcitrance of the leachate hydrocarbons may be attributable to their high molecular weight, since {{the majority of the}} TPH was long-chained hydrocarbons of C 20 or greater for leachate. In contrast, the diluent contaminated groundwater has a majority of its TPH concentration in short-chained hydrocarbons of C 20 or less, which were more easily biodegraded. These short chain hydrocarbons are typically more toxic than the longer chain hydrocarbons, which would explain the observed decrease in toxicity of the diluent-contaminated groundwater during biodegradation...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies of}} marine {{invertebrates}} and fish {{have suggested that}} lower and upper critical temperatures (CTmin and CTmax) are coupled by a common mechanism: oxygen and capacity limitation of thermal tolerance (OCLT). Using thermolimit <b>respirometry,</b> we <b>tested</b> the predictions of this theory for terrestrial arthropods by measuring maxima and minima for both critical temperatures and metabolic rate in two arthropods, the isopod Porcellio scaber and the beetle Tenebrio molitor, at 40 %, 21 %, 10 % and 2. 5 % ambient O 2. Critical temperatures were identified as particular points on both activity and V̇co 2 traces in four ways. In the first two instances, we identified the inflection points in regressions of absolute difference sum (ADS) residuals calculated for activity (aADS) and V̇co 2 (VI), respectively. In the third, we visually identified the lowest point before the post-mortal peak in CO 2 release (PMV). Finally, we pinpointed the sudden drop in V̇co 2 at death, where V̇co 2 fell outside the 95 % confidence intervals of the 5 min period immediately preceding the drop-off (CI). Minimum and maximum metabolic rates were determined using CO 2 traces, and the temperatures corresponding to these identified as TMetmin and TMetMax. For both species, ambient oxygen concentration did not influence CT min, minimum metabolic rate, or TMetMin. By contrast, severe hypoxia (2. 5 % O 2) caused a 6. 9 °C decline in activity-based CTmax for T. molltor and a 10. 6 °C decline for P. scaber, relative to normoxia (21 % O 2). The magnitude of this decrease differed between methods used to estimated critical thermal limits, highlighting {{the need for a}} standard method to determine these endpoints during thermolimit respirometry. Maximum metabolic rate also declined with decreasing ambient oxygen in both species. The combination of increasing metabolic rate and oxygen limitation affected upper thermal limits in these arthropods only in severe hypoxia (2. 5 % O 2). In both species, CTmin and CT max responded differently to oxygen limitation, suggesting {{that this is not a}} common mechanism coupling upper and lower limits in terrestrial arthropods. © 2010.

40|$|Transforming river {{systems and}} their {{surrounding}} habitats {{is the most}} widespread threat to the function of lotic ecosystems. To meet increasing demands for the limited supply of fresh water, humans have extensively altered river systems through diversions and impoundments, use for irrigation, drinking water, food fishing, generating hydro-electricity, and transporting goods and services. These modifications have resulted in an oversimplification of riverine habitats and global declines of many fluvial dependent species. Sturgeons are a group of fluvial dependent species affected by river modifications and {{may be the most}} imperiled group of species on Earth. Most sturgeons are threatened across the globe due to a combination of unregulated harvest and habitat loss. The federally endangered pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) and a congener, the threatened shovelnose sturgeon (S. platorynchus) are two species that depend solely on the large rivers of North America. Both species have experienced declines from habitat loss within the Mississippi River basin and overharvest due to the demand for black egg caviar, and are now protected from harvest where they overlap in range. However, pallid sturgeon populations continue to decline while shovelnose sturgeon have remained stable. Efforts to conserve pallid sturgeon have been ongoing for decades, but most studies describing pallid sturgeon life history have been conducted in altered habitats, making it difficult to determine unknown aspects of pallid sturgeon ecology and conservation needs. As a result, knowledge gaps still remain in our understanding of habitat needs during early life and adulthood for both species. Further, little information exists on how these similar sturgeons coexisted historically and why they are now on such different population trajectories. To address these issues, I investigated Scaphirhynchus sturgeon ecology and coexistence at multiple scales. I first examined the environmental life history of pallid and shovelnose sturgeon within the Mississippi River basin (Chapter 2). Using microchemistry techniques, my goal was to assess how to improve species conservation by identifying ecologically relevant management boundaries for pallid and shovelnose sturgeon. My results highlighted a mismatch between conservation boundaries and Scaphirhynchus sturgeon river use and I suggested that managers should consider expanding current protections for pallid sturgeon to include the unprotected sections of the Mississippi River. Chapters 3 and 4 of my dissertation centered on habitat use at smaller spatial scales (3 ̆c 1 m 2) and the individual differences between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon that may occur within different microhabitats (e. g., substrate and velocity). For example, alluvial sand dunes are thought to provide energetic relief for benthic fishes in energetically costly riverine landscapes. However, use of alluvial dune habitat is not well understood, and it is unclear whether dunes provide refuge that effectively reduces energetic costs. I designed a scale-relevant experiment to examine the energetic responses (measured as oxygen consumption; MO 2) associated with sand dune habitat in rivers (Chapter 3). Using <b>respirometry,</b> I <b>tested</b> whether pallid sturgeon experienced reduced energetic costs with different configurations of simulated sand dune habitat. Sturgeon displayed distinct station holding behaviors when behind a dune, in front of a dune, and with no dune present. Dune location did not affect energy expenditure, but sturgeon MO 2 was on average 16 − 20...|$|R
