5|$|Since September 2014, several journalists, {{commentators}} {{and financial}} sector insiders have again raised {{the prospect of}} further currency war. This time, rather than being intended as a <b>means</b> <b>to</b> boost competitiveness, some states, especially Japan and the Eurozone, may be motivated to devalue their currencies as a <b>means</b> <b>to</b> counter the threat of deflation. ECB President Mario Draghi has however denied any intent to engage in competitive devaluation.|$|E
5|$|Acquacotta {{was invented}} in part as a <b>means</b> <b>to</b> make stale, {{hardened}} bread edible. People that worked {{away from home for}} significant periods of time, such as woodcutters and shepherds, would bring bread and other foods with them (such as pancetta and salt cod) to hold them over. Acquacotta was prepared and used to marinate the stale bread, thus softening it.|$|E

5|$|At {{the height}} of the Great Depression, in 1933, Keynes {{published}} The <b>Means</b> <b>to</b> Prosperity, which contained specific policy recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter-cyclical public spending. The <b>Means</b> <b>to</b> Prosperity contains one of the first mentions of the multiplier effect. While it was addressed chiefly to the British Government, it also contained advice for other nations affected by the global recession. A copy was sent to the newly elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt and other world leaders. The work was taken seriously by both the American and British governments, and according to Robert Skidelsky, helped pave the way for the later acceptance of Keynesian ideas, though it had little immediate practical influence. In the 1933 London Economic Conference opinions remained too diverse for a unified course of action to be agreed upon.|$|E

5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated merely as <b>means</b> <b>to</b> ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely as a <b>means</b> <b>to</b> an end, so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. This {{does not mean that}} we can never treat a human as a <b>means</b> <b>to</b> an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E
