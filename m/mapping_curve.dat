40|$|The {{accurate}} {{display of}} {{high dynamic range}} images requires the application of complex tone mapping operators. These operators are computationally costly, which prevents their usage in interactive applications. We propose a general framework that delivers interactive performance to an important subclass of tone mapping operators, namely global tone mapping operators. The proposed framework consists of four steps: sampling the input image, applying the tone mapping operator, fitting the point-sampled tone <b>mapping</b> <b>curve,</b> and reconstructing the tone <b>mapping</b> <b>curve</b> for all pixels of the input image. We show how {{to make use of}} recent graphics hardware while keeping the advantage of generality by performing tone mapping in software.

40|$|A 3 -level DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform) based {{objective}} video quality {{measurement method}} is proposed based on semi-fragile digital watermarking. The watermark is embedded into the luminance {{components of the}} Intra frames of an MPEG- 2 video stream, {{which can be treated}} as images. The degradation of the watermark is used to estimate the degradation of the cover work. A quantization method is used to embed the watermark. In the watermark embedding process, 10 quantization parameters are assigned to the 10 DWT decomposed blocks which are obtained by applying 3 -level DWT to the target image. And the watermark is embedded with its vulnerability adjusted according to the different frequency distribution of the content of the cover work. Automatic control is used to adjust the watermark vulnerability which is controlled by the watermark bit portions and the quantization parameters. By referring to the ideal <b>mapping</b> <b>curve</b> which is the pre-calculated relationship between the quality in terms of the classical metrics and the True Detection Rates (TDR), the TDR and quality measurement (PSNR/wPSNR/Watson JND) relationship curve of any test image can be converged to the ideal <b>mapping</b> <b>curve</b> so that the quality of the degraded image can easily measured by checking the ideal <b>mapping</b> <b>curve</b> with the TDR computed during the watermark extraction. The TDR is calculated between the original watermark and the degraded watermark. After the watermark extraction, the degradation of the extracted watermark is used to estimate video/image quality in terms of the classical metrics.

For this reason, when deploying pico sites, their location is based on a function that combines traffic density and areas suffering low user satisfaction rate. When considering a hybrid evolution path with new pico sites and macro upgrades, a fixed number of pico sites are first deployed, followed by any additional macro upgrades necessary to meet the KPI are carried out. With regard to the energy consumption of pico sites, energy models give an approximate ratio of 5 : 1 for the number of pico sites required to consume the same energy as a regular 3 sector single carrier macro site.|$|E

30|$|This article {{proposed}} a novel image enhancement algorithm which simultaneously accomplishes dynamic range compression and local contrast enhancement. One merit {{of the proposed}} method is that the proposed SDRCLCE algorithm can combine with any monotonically increasing and continuously differentiable intensity transfer function, such as the typical gamma curve, to achieve dynamic range compression with local contrast preservation/enhancement for LDR images. Moreover, a novel intensity transfer function is proposed to adaptively control the curvature of the processed intensity <b>mapping</b> <b>curve</b> for each pixel depending on the local mean value. By combining the proposed intensity transfer function with SDRCLCE algorithm, the proposed method possesses the adjustability to separately control the level of enhancement on the overall lightness and contrast achieved at the output. The proposed method is also extended to combine with a linear RGB/YCbCr color remapping algorithm that preserves color information of the original image during image/video enhancement process. Therefore, the proposed method provides a useful lightness-contrast enhancement solution for the applications of image/video processing because of the flexible adjustability with image color preserving. The performance of the proposed SDRCLCE method has been compared with three state-of-the-art methods, both quantitatively and visually. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed SDRCLCE method not only outperforms all of them in terms of dynamic range compression and local contrast enhancement, but also provides good visual representation in visual comparison. Moreover, the proposed method is amenable to parallel processing, which improves the processing speed of SDRCLCE method to satisfy the requirement of real-time applications. The combination with a color restoration algorithm is left to our future study.|$|E
