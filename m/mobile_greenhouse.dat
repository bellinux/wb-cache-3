40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the relative efficiency of mobile emission reduction countermeasures through a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach and determined {{the priority of}} countermeasures based on the efficiency. Ten countermeasures currently applied for reducing greenhouse gases and air pollution materials were selected to make a scenario for evaluation. The reduction volumes of four air pollution materials(CO, HC, NOX, PM) and three greenhouse gases(CO 2, CH 4, N 2 O) for the year 2027, which is the last target year, were calculated by utilizing both a travel demand forecasting model and variable composite emission factors with respect to future travel patterns. To estimate the relative effectiveness of reduction countermeasures, this study performed a super-efficiency analysis among the Data Envelopment Analysis models. It was found that expanding the participation in self car-free day program was the most superior reduction measurement with 1. 879 efficiency points, followed by expansion of exclusive bus lanes and promotion of CNG hybrid bus diffusion. The {{results of this study}} do not represent the absolute data for prioritizing reduction countermeasures for <b>mobile</b> <b>greenhouse</b> gases and air pollution materials. However, in terms of presenting the direction for establishing reduction countermeasures, this study may contribute to policy selection for mobile emission reduction measures and the establishment of systematic mid- and long-ter...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} using navigation methods for agricultural <b>mobile</b> robots in <b>greenhouses.</b> Nowadays, many agricultural tasks are dangerous and repetitive for human beings and could be improved employing robots. The autonomous navigation in greenhouses has been solved using both deliberative and pseudo-reactive techniques. The first one utilizes a based-on map algorithm to create a safe and obstacle-free path to travel. The second technique applies a sensor feedback algorithm to cross the greenhouse corridors. Both strategies have been implemented and tested in real environment, obtaining quite appropriate results. Copyright @ 2007 IFAC...|$|R

It re{{presents a}} comprehensive attempt to use the successful principles of AGVs (auto-guided vehicles) inside greenhouses, but avoiding the necessity of modifying the crop layout, and avoiding having to bury metallic pipes in the greenhouse floor. The designed vehicle can operate different tools, e. g., a spray system for applying plant-protection product, a lifting platform {{to reach the top}} part of the plants to perform pruning and harvesting tasks, and a trailer to transport fruits, plants, and crop waste. Regarding autonomous navigation, it follows the idea of AGVs, but now laser emitters are used to mark the desired route.

40|$|With the {{increased}} interest in the interactions of land use and transportation and their related impacts on global warming, {{there is now a}} warranted need for improved and quicker techniques for simulating mobile source based, regional and sub-regional greenhouse gas emissions. The Bay Area Simplified Simulation of Travel, Energy and Greenhouse Gases (BASTEGG) is a GIS-based tool for calculating automobile availability, vehicle usage, fuel consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions, by each household within the San Francisco Bay Area at the neighborhood level. There are three component models in the BASSTEGG, simulating auto ownership levels, vehicle usage levels, and carbon dioxide emissions. Socio-economic and relative transit-to-highway accessibility data at the travel analysis zone level is used to predict the distribution of households by vehicle availability level. Cross-classification models of vehicle miles of travel per household (VMT/HH) are applied based on urban density levels, workers in household levels, income levels, and vehicle availability levels. Lastly, emissions per mile models, based on California Air Resources Board’s EMFAC models for various forecast years, are used to convert VMT per household into on-road, <b>mobile</b> source <b>greenhouse</b> gas emissions per household. The BASSTEGG model is intended to be used in land use alternatives scenario testing at the regional level, and by city planners interested in the VMT and greenhouse gases produced by residents of their communities...|$|R
40|$|The road of a {{greenhouse}} is both damp and narrow, {{and there are}} both ground obstacles and space obstacles in {{a greenhouse}}, which easily cause the instability problem for a four-wheel independent driving <b>greenhouse</b> spraying <b>mobile</b> robot turning in the greenhouse. In order to improve the steering performance of the <b>greenhouse</b> spraying <b>mobile</b> robot, based on the characteristics that each wheel torque of the robot can be separately controlled, the dynamic model of the four-wheel independent steering system is firstly established by using the D'alembert’s Principle and choosing the sideslip angle and the yaw velocity as the state variables. Then, based on the theory of sliding mode control, a dynamic sliding mode control strategy with exponential approaching rate is proposed by adopting the sideslip angle and the yaw velocity as the joint control variables {{in order to make}} the sideslip angle be in the stable range and make the oyaw velocity track the desired value well. Finally, the simulation of the steering performance is performed using Matlab/Simulink. The control response curves of the yaw velocity and the sideslip angle of the robot’s mass-center in a step input and in a sinusoidal input are obtained respectively. It is shown from the simulation results that compared with the feedforward-feedback control method, the proposed dynamic sliding mode control strategy based on the established dynamic model is effective to improve the turning control stability of the <b>mobile</b> robot for <b>greenhouse</b> spraying. The experiment results further verify the feasibility of the proposed turning control strategy...|$|R
40|$|Alstroemeria is a {{relatively}} new crop in floriculture and is rapidly increasing in popularity. The plant is a herbaceous perennial and produces flowers that are attractive and long lasting. Some authors refer this genus to the family Amaryllidaceae, other to the Liliaceae, and same prefer a separate family Alstroemeriaceae. The erect, unbranched shoots originate from a subterranean sympodial rhizome. Alstroemeria and some closely related genera are characterized by leaves which are twisted 180 °, so that the morphological upper side is turned downwards. Under favourable conditions the shoots form terminal umbelliform clusters of flowers. During the growth period the roots thicken into tubers. The research described in this paper has been performed with the hybrid 'Walter Fleming', a cultivar of English origin, general grown in Holland under the name 'Orchid'. The aim of this research was to investigate the structure of the plant and its ecological reactions in order to realize optima production conditions and a better timing of the crop. SHOOT FORMATIONShoots are initiated on a subterranean rhizome and its branches. Under greenhouse conditions, the number of shoots increases rapidly after the winter period. At that tine many rhizomes are active and the shoots grow fast. During flowering and shortly after, however, there is a rest period following which shoot formation is resumed. Until the beginning of the flowering period there is no significant influence of temperature (minimum 9 °C) on shoot formation. Comparing growth at 17, 21 and 25 °C shoot formation was found to increase with. increasing temperature. At 13 and 9 °C shoot formation stops in long photoperiod and the plants enter a rest stage, firstly at 13 °C and afterwards at 9 °C. In the early stage of plant development shoot formation in plants grown at high temperature was stimulated by lowering the temperature and vice versa. Lowering the temperature caused the rhizomes to branch more, while raising the temperature caused more lateral shoots to develop. Rest started in the lateral rhizomes. Dormancy is prevented or broken by high temperature. High temperature stimulated shoot formation; {{there was no evidence of}} a specific diurnal effect however. High soil temperature also promoted shoot formation. At a temperature of 25 °C both flowering and growth were completely inhibited. Low light intensity decreased the number of shoots produced. It was difficult however to determine the precise effect of light intensity because of the interaction with temperature. Shoot formation was inversely proportional to daylength. LDs inhibited growth of young shoots as well as the branching of rhizomes and SDs reversed the effect. FLOWER INITIATIONLow temperature promoted flowering of Alstroemeria; it decreased the number of nodes below the inflorescence and shoots of more proximal origin flowered earlier. At 25 °C and above no flowers were initiated. The number and percentage of generative shoots were not a useful-measure of induction as the number of shoots was also affected by temperature and daylength. The length of the temperature treatment during the 24 hour period had-more influence m flower initiation than either the day or night temperature. High soil temperature had a negative influence, this was more pronounced when the air temperature was high. The number and percentage of generative shoots was reduced by very low light intensity. Increasing daylength decreased the number of nodes under the inflorescence and the number of vegetative shoots per rhizome. The highest number of flowering shoots were produced at a daylength of 12 hours, which permitted both shoot formation and flower initiation to proceed. At a given daylength or temperature the further the shoots were from the proximal end of the rhizome, the earlier they flowered. FLOWERINGIn spring when daylength and temperature are favourable for flower initiation Alstroemeria flowers abundantly. The reduction in the number of nodes below the inflorescence is accompanied by a decrease in the number of days to flowering. The flowering period is markedly compressed by the fact that the youngest shoots i. e. those arising at the distal end of the rhizome, form less nodes below the inflorescence than proximal shoots. In addition, the increasing daylength induces earlier flowering. The influence of a given temperature on the flowering time is the result of its effect on flower initiation and rate of development. High temperature inhibits initiation but promotes development. The number of branches per umbel showed an unequal frequency distribution with a clear preference for 3, 5 and 8. This agrees with the phyllotaxis 3 / 8, which indicates that flower bud differentiation stops more frequently after initiation of a whole spiral than after a partial one. Numbers of branches per umbel are correlated with thickness of the main stem. The number of branches is influenced by daylength but not by temperature. Numbers of flowers per stalk increased with temperature to 21 °C, but the differences were not statistically significant. In the greenhouse during winter most flower buds abort as a result of the poor light conditions. TUBER FORMATIONLow temperature and LDs promote both flowering and thickening of the roots. During and just after flowering there was a strong increase in tuber growth. This increase of tuber weight can be attributed to resorption of substrates from the old shoots and their storage in the tubers. The nearly simultaneous swelling of the young, short roots just behind the growing points of the rhizome and the retardation of the growth of the young shoots indicate a common factor controlling both effects. FLOWERING TIMEThe main flowering of 'Walter Fleming' grown in greenhouses in the Netherlands occurs in the months of April, May and June, independent of the planting date. Flowering can be advanced by means of artificial lighting, but this should not be continued longer than necessary as shoot formation is retarded. A 4 hour nightbreak of cyclic lighting at an intensity of 100 - 150 mW over two weeks is suitable. Another method is to extend the daylength to 12 hours, this has only a small adverse effect m shoot formation. The high greenhouse temperatures in summer are unfavourable for flowering. A good second crop in late summer may be realized using <b>mobile</b> <b>greenhouses,</b> leaving the plants temporarily outdoors where the temperature is lower. In the greenhouses flower initiation occurs by the natural lowering of temperature during late summer and autumn. The success of this late flush however depends on the time of initiation as decreasing light intensity results in flower bud blasting. For this reason it is not desirable to induce flowering in autumn by extending the daylength. RESTIn their native habitat many Alstroemeria species enter a stage of rest during summer, this also occurs in the Netherlands. In 'Walter Fleming' the symptom are highly dependent on temperature and daylength. Low temperature and LD not only promote flowering and tuber growth, but also rest. At high temperature LDs cause only a reduction of shoot growth which disappears in SDs. When plants grow at low temperatures (9 or 13 °C) and LDs they enter a state of complete rest, with shoots dying off after flowering. This Test can be broken by a long period of high temperature. Removing flower buds or shoots and harvesting flowers diminishes the rest period. When old shoots are left on the plants they promote rest. In the discussion this pattern of reactions of 'Walter Fleming' is compared with that of other crops. The reactions are discussed in relation to the climate in the native habitat of the supposed parent species of this hybrid. Since Alstroemeria presents a wide variation of species growing under extremely different climatic conditions, it is to be expected that hybrids my be bred in which flower production and the flowering period can be controlled more easily...|$|R
