Sometime in 1849, however, {{it appears that the}} two had a falling out, and they parted ways pursuing separate means of performing this experiment. In 1848−49, Fizeau used, not a rotating mirror, but a toothed wheel apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the speed of light in air. In 1850, Fizeau and Foucault both used rotating mirror devices to perform relative measures of the speed of light in air versus water. Foucault used a scaled-up version of the rotating <b>mirror</b> <b>apparatus</b> to perform an absolute measurement of the speed of light in 1862. Subsequent experiments performed by Marie Alfred Cornu in 1872–76 and by Albert A. Michelson in 1877–1931 used improved versions of the toothed wheel and rotating mirror experiments to make steadily more accurate estimates of the speed of light.|$|E

2500|$|Fourier {{transform}} infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is {{a measurement}} technique that {{allows one to}} record infrared spectra. [...] Infrared light is guided through an interferometer and then through the sample (or vice versa). [...] A moving <b>mirror</b> inside the <b>apparatus</b> alters the distribution of infrared light that passes through the interferometer. The signal directly recorded, called an [...] "interferogram", represents light output {{as a function of}} mirror position. A data-processing technique called Fourier transform turns this raw data into the desired result (the sample's spectrum): Light output as a function of infrared wavelength (or equivalently, wavenumber). As described above, the sample's spectrum is always compared to a reference.|$|R

The system allows for the measurement of geometries in rocket exhaust plumes while recording pressure and temperature. The complete system consists of a flow visualization sub-system and the data acquisition and control (DACS) sub-system. For the flow visualization system we evaluated several options with the final choice being a double-pass single <b>mirror</b> schlieren <b>apparatus.</b> For the DACS we developed hardware and software that is capable of controlling the test while logging the desired data. The group constructed and tested a full scale prototype in order to validate the design choices. To assess the performance of the systems, tests were conducted to evaluate the viewing area, resolution of the images, ease of alignment, and external interferences. The DACS team developed software to control the mechanical and electrical components of the system while logging pressure and temperature data. The exhaust plumes and corresponding effects of multiple nozzle types can be evaluated using our schlerien double-pass system.

50|$|The Michelson-Morley experiment(Ref. 7) and {{variations}} of that experiment, fail to detect any {{motion of the}} Earth through a preferred frame. The theory of Einstein accounts for these results by stipulating that light travels at speed c independent of {{the motion of the}} apparatus, and when viewed from the frame of the apparatus, this very simply explains the null result. The theory of Lorentz accounts for the null result by postulating that the apparatus dimensions are shrunk in the direction of motion by just the amount needed to comply with the null result (Postulate HAL-II). The theory proposed herein accounts for the null result by postulating that the <b>apparatus</b> <b>mirrors</b> enforce nodes in the electric field that move along with the apparatus (Postulate DJL-II). The node-enforcement hypothesis has been discussed in great detail and will be summarized below.|$|R

Presented in this project report are the description of the design synthesis that led to the final design, optical and mechanical characteristics of the design, design analysis, hardware and construction considerations, and test results of this three-degree-of-freedom <b>mirror</b> positioner. The <b>apparatus,</b> the only active electro-mechanical device within the optical system, provided real time beam pointing and phasing corrections by simultaneous steering (tip/tilt about two orthogonal axes in plan with the mirror surface) and optical path adjustment (translational motion normal to the mirror surface) of the incident laser beam. Its design is characterized by the requirement for steering and translational adjustment accuracy of 0. 6 microradians and 5 nanometers respectively, at an open-loop operating frequency of 2, 000 Hertz (cps). The complete mirror positioner consists of a high quality laser mirror contained in a strain-free mirror mount. This assembly in turn is supported by a frictionless suspension system. The steering and piston motions of the mirror are provided by a two-stage (coarse and fine) frictionless and backlash-free compound actuation system that is computer controlled for high frequency response. A novel concept using a single actuator for translation motion resulted in a dynamically stable and compact package. The completed positioner was run under open loop control and successfully met all performance specifications and design criteria...|$|R
50|$|Therefore, {{while the}} mirrors may enforce nodes on the allowed {{electric}} fields {{to force a}} null result of the MM test, it remains possible that the velocity of propagation of the amplitude function (which is the velocity of energy propagation) within the apparatus travels at a speed of C {{with respect to a}} preferred frame only. A non-null result of a group velocity equivalent of the MM test is thus possible, and such a test is therefore a critical new test for space-time theory. A group velocity equivalent of the MM test is possible with the recently developed technology of ultrashort laser pulses One hundred and fifty femtosecond laser pulses of fundamental angular frequency &omega; can be split in two by a beam splitter, sent through two mutually perpendicular paths and recombined. The recombined pulse can be sent through a non-linear doubling crystal to produce second harmonic (2&omega;) photons, and then through a filter to eliminate the fundamental. (Here, the entire fringe pattern passes through the doubling crystal.) The 2&omega; photon intensity can be monitored over time. Since the number of 2&omega; photons produced in the doubling crystal is nonlinear, many more photons will be produced if the two pulses arrive at the crystal simultaneously than will be produced if the two pulses arrive separately. Thus by measuring the number of 2&omega; photons produced, it is possible to measure the relative arrival time of the two pulses. If the velocity of energy propagation is C with respect to the ether, as proposed here, rotation of the device will cause a shift in the relative arrival time (following the traditional MM arguments), and this will cause a change in the number of 2&omega; photons produced by the crystal. If the Einstein or Lorentz theory is more representative of nature, the relative arrival time of the pulses will not change during rotation, {{and there will be no}} change in the number of 2&omega; photons produced by the crystal. Since it is known that if the path lengths of the two apparatus arms are held fixed, no fringe shift is observed, this information can be used to lock the path lengths to a constant relative value by sending a continuous wave HeNe laser beam into the apparatus through a dichroic beam splitter, detecting the interference pattern of the HeNe beam, and using a piezoelectric spacer to lock the interference pattern onto a single fringe. Thus with such a locked apparatus, the Earth’s rotation can rotate the device. The phase of reflected light is dependent upon frequency, both in metallic and dielectric mirrors, but this effect can be overcome for the proposed test. Efforts in the last ten years on ultrafast laser pulse generation have relied on the development of mirrors that reflect ultrafast pulses without broadening them to any significant extent. The relevant point is that the mirrors have flat amplitude and phase response over the bandwidth of the pulses. Such mirrors have already been developed for the pulse lengths required for a group velocity equivalent of the MM test. Note that while the axioms presented herein do allow for a non-null result of a group velocity equivalent of the MM test, the axioms proposed herein do not require a non-null result. It is, of course, possible that the MM <b>apparatus</b> <b>mirrors</b> affect the group velocity of light as well. While it is best for theories to make firm predictions upon which they can be judged, in this case the theory proposed herein merely allows a non-null result of a group velocity equivalent of the MM test; no firm prediction can be made; the test is equivocal. But the Einstein and Lorentz theories do not allow a non-null result, so should a non-null result be experimentally obtained, it would be strong evidence that the best theory of space and time is that proposed herein.|$|R
