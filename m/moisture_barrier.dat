25|$|The {{deterioration}} of wood occurred at typically vulnerable areas, {{such as the}} exposed end grain of arches and muntins and where wood members intersect. The humidity in the building was a contributing factor to wood deterioration. The level of moisture in the building was exacerbated by two conditions. First, the building’s natural ventilation system had been removed in a past repair. The ventilators, which were originally located in the low wall area, had been filled in, and some ridge ventilators were inoperable. The air flow through the ventilators, which would have assisted in the evaporation of water, was not occurring. Second, the penetration of rain water from {{the exterior of the}} building, because of inadequate or deteriorated waterproofing, had increased the level of moisture in the wood. The copper sheathing that had originally capped the arch exteriors, in addition to acting as a <b>moisture</b> <b>barrier,</b> may have been acting as a biocide through copper oxides inhibiting wood rot.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the roof}} was completed, the {{reflecting}} pool was constructed on top of it. The landscape architects Clarke and Rapuano designed the [...] deep, [...] pool. The pool walls were [...] thick at the base, and tapered as they rose. A sheet of monel (a rustproof nickel alloy metal) was embedded in the wall, rising to within [...] {{of the top of}} the wall. The entire wall was coated in epoxy as a waterproofer. Nine [...] steel girders acted both to support the pool above and the ceiling of the main exhibition hall below.

Five layers of roofing felt were laid atop the concrete floor, followed by a [...] layer of perlite. A grid of concrete beams, each [...] and over [...] long, was laid in the perlite to support the layers above. Inverted U-shaped drainage tiles were inserted between the beams to help remove any water which leaked from above. A [...] thick sheet of polyethylene formed a <b>moisture</b> <b>barrier</b> above the perlite, and [...] thick layer of concrete laid atop the <b>moisture</b> <b>barrier.</b> The bottom of the pool consisted of another five layers of roofing felt, on top of which were laid a [...] thick layer of gravel. [...] The gravel-impregnated grout was laid down in alternating grey and white sections (each section separated by a brass rail), to add visual distinctiveness {{to the bottom of the}} pool. The granite for the lip of the pool was imported from West Germany. The granite, which was shaped to wrap around the exterior, top, and interior of the lip, was about [...] thick. [...] The lip of the pool was made of concrete. It was [...] wide, and dropped in a pitch of [...] was it extended toward the water. Overflow drains were placed at intervals on the inside of the lip, just below the granite cladding. A gutter just outside the pool provided extra diversion in case water spilled over the lip. Grey granite slabs, also imported from West Germany, formed a sidewalk around the pool.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{grasses and}} straw {{have been in}} use {{in a range of}} ways in {{building}} since pre-history around the world, their incorporation in machine-manufactured modular bales seems to date back to the early 20th century in the midwestern United States, particularly the sand-hills of Nebraska, where grass was plentiful and other building materials (even quality sods) were not. Straw bale building typically consists of stacking a series of rows of bales (often in running-bond) on a raised footing or foundation, with a <b>moisture</b> <b>barrier</b> between. Bale walls are often tied together with pins of bamboo or wood (internal to the bales or on their faces), or with surface wire meshes, and then stuccoed or plastered either lime-based formulations or earth/clay renders. [...] Bale buildings can either have a structural frame of other materials, with bales between (simply serving as insulation and stucco substrate), referred to as [...] "infill",or the bales may actually provide the support for openings and roof, referred to as [...] "load-bearing" [...] or [...] "Nebraska-style", or a combination of framing and load-bearing may be employed, referred to a [...] "hybrid" [...] straw bale.|$|E

40|$|Insulation is an {{important}} component of building energy efficiency (Table 2). If not selected or installed properly, it may not be effective at retarding heat flow. Insulation is a material that slows the transfer of heat. Heat always travels from hot to cold. So, in the summertime, insulation serves as a barrier to retard the hot, outside conditions from entering the cooler, inside conditions of a home or building. In the wintertime, it retards the flow of warmth inside a building from transferring to the colder outside conditions. As most readers will recall, heat is transferred by three methods: conduction, radiation and convection. Radiant barriers such as aluminum foil retard radiant heat flow, while infiltration and <b>moisture</b> <b>barriers</b> retard convective heat transfer. A combination of these may b...|$|R

50|$|The usual {{clothing}} for Arctic or mountain regions is a parka and heavy insulated mittens with long gauntlets {{to protect the}} wrist, gaiters to keep snow and moisture {{out of the top}} of the boots, and wool-felt or down-insulated booties. In high wind-chills, these garments may be supplemented by a mask, usually of oiled wool. In Arctic areas, the typical modern insulation is very fine hydrophobic polyester fiber batting sewn in laps between a nylon shell. The sewing must not compress or quilt the insulation, because the heat leaks out through the thin spots. Most designers now include a <b>moisture</b> <b>barrier</b> on the inner side to prevent condensation from a body's moisture from condensing and freezing in the insulation.

Types of food benefits included protection against oxidation; controlled release of encapsulated ingredients (moisture or pH); test disguising; delivery of nanoencapsulated nutrient substances, vitamins, and flavors; pathogen detection in food systems; food safety; and quality analysis. Some food packaging applications included improved packaging (gas and <b>moisture</b> <b>barriers,</b> tensile strength); shelf-life extension via active packaging, nanoadditives, intelligent packaging, nutraceutical delivery, and controlled release; antibacterial effects of self-cleaning packaging; and product condition monitoring during transportation.

To increase the shelf-lifetime of these devices, transparent <b>moisture</b> <b>barriers</b> of silicon nitride (SiNx) films are deposited at low temperature by hot wire CVD (HW-CVD) process. Instead of the conventional route based on organic/inorganic hybrid structures, this work defines a new route consisting in depositing multilayer stacks of SiNx thin films, each single layer being treated by argon plasma. The plasma treatment allows creating smoother surface and surface atom rearrangement.
