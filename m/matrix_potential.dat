50|$|In many cases, {{absolute}} value of <b>matrix</b> <b>potential</b> can be relatively large {{in comparison to}} the other components of water potential discussed above. <b>Matrix</b> <b>potential</b> markedly reduces the energy state of water near particle surfaces. Although water movement due to <b>matrix</b> <b>potential</b> may be slow, it is still extremely important in supplying water to plant roots and in engineering applications. The <b>matrix</b> <b>potential</b> is always negative because the water attracted by the soil matrix has an energy state lower than that of pure water. <b>Matrix</b> <b>potential</b> only occurs in unsaturated soil above the water table. If the <b>matrix</b> <b>potential</b> approaches a value of zero, nearly all soil pores are completely filled with water, i.e. fully saturated and at maximum retentive capacity. The <b>matrix</b> <b>potential</b> can vary considerably among soils. In the case that water drains into less-moist soil zones of similar porosity, the <b>matrix</b> <b>potential</b> is generally in the range of −10 to −30 kPa.|$|E

50|$|When {{water is}} {{in contact with}} solid {{particles}} (e.g., clay or sand particles within soil), adhesive intermolecular forces between {{the water and the}} solid can be large and important. The forces between the water molecules and the solid particles in combination with attraction among water molecules promote surface tension and the formation of menisci within the solid matrix. Force is then required to break these menisci. The magnitude of <b>matrix</b> <b>potential</b> depends on the distances between solid particles—the width of the menisci (also capillary action and differing Pa at ends of capillary)—and the chemical composition of the solid matrix (meniscus, macroscopic motion due to ionic attraction).|$|E

The relationships between plant-based indicators and soil <b>matrix</b> <b>potential</b> as well as meteorological factors of jujube under deficit irrigation compared with well irrigation were determined. The results showed that maximum daily trunk shrinkage increased and maximum daily trunk diameter, gas conductance and midday leaf water potential decreased in response to higher and lower soil <b>matrix</b> <b>potential,</b> respectively.
