5|$|Summerteeth (stylized as summerteeth) is {{the third}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Wilco, released on March 9, 1999 by Reprise Records. The album was heavily influenced lyrically by 20th century literature, as well as singer Jeff Tweedy's <b>marital</b> <b>problems.</b> Unlike previous albums, Summerteeth was heavily overdubbed {{in the studio with}} Pro Tools. Tweedy and Jay Bennett wrote most of the album in the studio, a contrast to the band's previous albums, which were often recorded live by the entire band with minimal overdubs.|$|E

40|$|M. A. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2015. Includes bibliographical references. Parents of {{children}} with disabilities tend to experience greater marital distress than parents of typically developing children. However this result is small overall and couples vary greatly. The present study sought to determine whether certain resiliency factors might moderate the impact of parenting stress on marital adjustment in parents {{of children}} with intellectual disability. Two factors that were investigated were the parenting alliance and <b>marital</b> <b>problem</b> solving. It was hypothesized that one or both of these factors might interact with parenting stress to predict marital satisfaction, such that parents who score high on these factors might be less negatively impacted by parenting stress. Results indicated that the parenting alliance {{was a significant predictor of}} marital satisfaction, but did not interact with parenting stress. <b>Marital</b> <b>problem</b> solving interacted with parenting stress, but rather than buffering high stress, was an asset at low stress, and its benefits were nullified at high stress...|$|R

5|$|By {{the start}} of 1973, John Lennon began {{distancing}} himself from {{the political and social}} issues he had embraced in the previous 18 months. It was also around this time that he and his wife, Yoko Ono, were going through <b>marital</b> <b>problems.</b> As Ono was completing her fourth album, Feeling the Space, Lennon decided he also wanted to record a new album, and liked the studio musicians that their assistant and production coordinator May Pang had assembled for Ono's album. Shortly thereafter, he asked Pang to book them for his sessions. Wanting to produce an album that would be more accepted than his previous politically charged commercial flop Some Time in New York City, Lennon began writing and demoing a few songs for Mind Games in his Greenwich Village apartment. He began composing after a period of almost a year of not writing any material.|$|E
5|$|One of the character's {{earliest}} storylines saw him becoming {{caught up}} in Karl and Susan Kennedy's <b>marital</b> <b>problems,</b> while treating their friend, Jim Dolan (Scott Parmeter). Rhys was with Jim when he died and he remained affected by his death for a long time. Rhys had a one-night stand with Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer), which left Kate feeling awkward around him. Rhys became determined to join the hospital's surgical training programme and was devastated when he missed out on a place. Rhys then romantically pursued Erin Salisbury (Elise Jansen) and through his manipulative behaviour he forced her to quit the programme. Exploration of the character's backstory began after his mother was introduced and Barber believed this would allow the audience to see why Rhys has become who he is.|$|E

40|$|In {{exploring}} the emotional climate of long-term marriages, {{this study used}} an observational coding system to identify specific emotional behaviors expressed by middle-aged and older spouses during discussions of a <b>marital</b> <b>problem.</b> One hundred and fifty-six couples differing in age and marital satisfaction were studied. Emotional behaviors expressed by couples differed {{as a function of}} age, gender, and marital satisfaction. In older couples, the resolution of conflict was less emotionally negative and more affectionate than in middle-aged marriages. Differences between husbands and wives and between happy and unhappy marriages were also found. Wives were more affectively negative than husbands, whereas husbands were more defensive than wives, and unhappy marriages involved greater exchange of negative affect than happy marriages...|$|R
5|$|Tucker and Devon {{continue}} to bond over their shared interest in music while Tucker manages {{to put aside}} his differences with Katherine. He and Harmony later find a specialist to operate on Devon to fully repair his hearing. Afterward, Ashley and Tucker begin having <b>marital</b> <b>problems</b> when it is revealed that Tucker {{had a relationship with}} Genevieve Atkinson, Jack's ex-fiancée, when they were teens. Ashley decides they need a break and before leaving town, she catches Tucker and Harmony in bed and files for divorce. Tucker's actions destroy all the progress he's made with Devon, but the two manage to rebuild their relationship. Tucker supports Ashley when Abby is supposedly kidnapped and they even share a kiss but Ashley still serves him with divorce papers. Tucker then began to advise Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) to take more power at Newman Enterprises, as Victor had disappeared after their wedding. She takes over as CEO while beginning an affair with Tucker; in reality, Tucker had hired Genevieve to find Victor and keep him away from Genoa City so Tucker can buy up all of the Newman Enterprises stock. Once Victor was presumed dead in Los Angeles, Sharon decided to marry Tucker, but Genevieve turned her back on Tucker and brought Victor back alive, who stopped the wedding. With Victor alive, Jack was forced to sell all of his Newman stock as well as Beauty of Nature to Tucker in order to make his margin call. Yet, Jack, with Genevieve's help, tried to blackmail Tucker to win back Beauty of Nature or else the SEC would investigate his recent actions. Tucker decided to face the SEC and sell Beauty of Nature back to Victor in order to stop Victor from pursuing continuing a criminal investigation into Sharon's actions. Victor agreed to Tucker's deal but an unaware Sharon went to the SEC and told them of the shell corporations Tucker set up to secretly buy up Newman stock. Victor informed Sharon of his deal with Tucker and she rushed to his office only to find Tucker being arrested by the SEC and FBI as she apologized to Tucker as he was led away asking if Sharon was responsible for his arrest. He was eventually released after Sharon recanted her story to the SEC. Jill later tried to convince Katherine to forgive Tucker, which she eventually did. After they became on better terms, Tucker announced he was moving to Hong Kong, leaving Katherine devastated. Tucker and Katherine are reunited just before she passes away. According to Devon, Katherine's death hits Tucker a lot harder than he would like to admit. Tucker is so devastated that he cannot attend Katherine's funeral. Katherine leaves Tucker her record collection saying music was his first and true passion.|$|E

5000|$|Controversy {{surrounds}} Cleopatra's exact date of death. A discovered hoard of Cleopatra's coins was dated at 17 AD. It {{has traditionally}} been believed that Cleopatra was alive to mint them; however, this would mean that Juba married the Cappadocian Princess, Glaphyra during Cleopatra's lifetime. To explain this strange <b>marital</b> <b>problem,</b> historians have supposed some sort of rift between Cleopatra and Juba that was eventually mended after Juba's divorce from Glaphyra. Modern historians dispute the idea that Juba, a thoroughly Romanized king, {{would have taken a}} second wife. The argument goes that if Juba married Glaphyra before 4 AD then his first wife, Cleopatra, must have already been dead. (The counterargument can be made that even contemporary client kings with Roman citizenship, such as Herod the Great, took multiple wives, and that Juba's father had more than one.) ...|$|R
40|$|This article reviews current {{findings}} on psychological predictors for a negative marital development and divorce. Theories on divorce are not resumed, as {{this article focuses}} exclusively on research data. Results on the significance of personality factors, cognitive variables, communication, attachment, stress, coping etc, are reviewed. The results show that currently important factors predicting the decline of marriages and their dissolution are known, which not only allow a rather reliable prediction, but also offer new possibilities in marital prevention. Whereas a number of assumed variables (such as physical attraction, status) do not reliably predict divorce, two main predictors have been found: neuroticism {{and a lack of}} competencies in the domains of <b>marital</b> communication, <b>marital</b> <b>problem</b> solving and individual as well as dyadic coping. These findings are discussed in regard to marital interventions, where three empirically based approaches for the prevention of marital distress are presented...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{inception}} of the economic reform, marital relationship in urban China has undergone dramatic transformations. Though the burgeoning body of scholarly research has demonstrated that marital quality has increasingly become an important aspect of family life among married persons in urban China, both the conceptualization and measurement of marital quality remain underdeveloped. The purpose of this pilot study is to develop and validate a comprehensive and culturally appropriate marital quality scale, namely the Chinese Marital Quality Scale (CMQS). Results from the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) conducted on a sample of 387 married persons from Beijing indicate that the CMQS can be conceptualized as a two-factorial and multidimensional construct, encompassing marital happiness, marital interaction, <b>marital</b> disagreement, <b>marital</b> <b>problem,</b> and <b>marital</b> instability. Additional statistical analyses also indicate that the CMQS has exhibited satisfactory reliability and concurrent validity. It is thus concluded that the CMQS is a reliable and valid instrument to measure marital quality in contemporary Beijing and possibly in other Chinese cities. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|During the {{welcoming}} {{session at the}} start of every academic year, teachers in Vanier College’s Psychology Department put on a skit to introduce incoming “psychology major” students, in a concise and entertaining manner, to the three different theoretical approaches currently prevailing in the discipline. In the skit, a teacher plays the role of a client who consults a psychotherapist (played by another teacher) for help with a <b>marital</b> <b>problem.</b> Seeking a solution to his problem, the “client” appears on stage three different times and receives treatment from three psychotherapists (played by another teacher) of different theoretical orientations: B. F. Skinner, Sigmund Freud, and “Dr. Phil”, the famous American talk-show host (who respectively represent behaviorism, psychoanalysis, and cognitive psychology). Generally speaking, this skit is the first real exposure to psychological theories for the new cohort of students. Based on the feedback received afterwards, it seems to have made a powerful impression on them. Which explains why we keep putting on the same skit year after year! One reason for the impressive success of this simple skit is quite clear: complex ideas can be effectively conveyed to even the most uninitiated in a concise and easily understood manner through dramatic techniques, because drama is engaging, entertaining, and thought-provoking. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
