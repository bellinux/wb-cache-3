500|$|On May 10, Giuliani held what The New York Times {{described}} as an [...] "extraordinary, emotional news conference" [...] in Bryant Park to announce that he was seeking a separation from Hanover, saying, [...] "This is very, very painful. For quite some time it's probably been apparent that Donna and I lead in many ways independent and separate lives." [...] Regarding Nathan, Giuliani said [...] "I'm going to need her now more than <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> before", making reference to his battle with cancer and her background in nursing. Regarding the senate race, he again did not commit to a decision, saying, [...] "I don't really care about politics right now. [...] I'm thinking about my family, the people that I love {{and what can be}} done that's honest and truthful and that protects them the best. [...] I'm not thinking about politics. Politics comes at least second, maybe third, maybe fourth, somewhere else. It'll all work itself out some way politically." [...] Giuliani had, however, neglected to inform Hanover in advance of his announcement; her reaction was {{described as}} distraught. [...] Three hours later, she held her own news conference at Gracie Mansion, where she said, [...] "Today's turn of events brings me great sadness. I had hoped to keep this marriage together. For several years, it was difficult to participate in Rudy's public life because of his relationship with one staff member." [...] In this, she was making reference to Cristyne Lategano, the former communications director for Giuliani; Vanity Fair had reported in 1997 that Lategano and Giuliani were having an affair, which both of them had denied. [...] Hanover continued, [...] "Beginning last May, I made a major effort to bring us back together. Rudy and I re-established some of our personal intimacy through the fall. At that point, he chose another path." ...|$|E

6000|$|Nor in jokes at {{the expense}} of policemen is the fun entirely on your side. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not proceed with judgment. It occurs to me now, looking back, that the neighbourhoods of Covent Garden and Great Marlborough Street were ill-chosen for sport of this nature. To bonnet a fat {{policeman}} is excellent fooling. While he is struggling with his helmet you can ask him comic questions, {{and by the time he}} has got his head free you are out of sight. But the game should be played in a district where there is not an average of three constables to every dozen square yards. When two other policemen, who have had their eye on you for the past ten minutes, are watching the proceedings from just round the next corner, you have little or no leisure for due enjoyment of the situation. By the time you have run the whole length of Great Titchfield Street and twice round Oxford Market, you are of opinion that a joke should never be prolonged beyond the point at which there is danger of its becoming wearisome; and that the time has now arrived for home and friends. The [...] "Law," [...] on the other hand, now raised by reinforcements to a strength of six or seven men, is just beginning to enjoy the chase. You picture to yourself, while doing Hanover Square, the scene in Court the next morning. You will be accused of being drunk and disorderly. It will be idle for you to explain to the magistrate (or to your relations afterwards) that you were only trying to live up to a man who did this sort of thing in a book and was admired for it. You will be fined the usual forty shillings; and on the next occasion of your calling at the Mayfields' the girls will be out, and Mrs. Mayfield, an excellent lady, who has always taken a motherly interest in you, will talk seriously to you and urge you to sign the pledge.|$|E

[Goes over to the table.] So this is poison. Is it not strange that in this liquor here There lies the key to all philosophies? [Takes the cup up.] It smells of poppies. I {{remember}} well That, when I was a child in Sicily, I took the scarlet poppies from the corn, And made a little wreath, and my grave uncle, Don John of Naples, laughed: I did not know That they had power to stay the springs of life, To make the pulse cease beating, and to chill The blood in its own vessels, till men come And with a hook hale the poor body out, And throw it in a ditch: the body, ay, - What of the soul? that goes to heaven or hell.

Still that white neck Will 'scape the headsman: I have seen to that: He will get hence from Padua to-night, And that is well. You are very wise, Lord Justices, And yet you are not half so wise as I am, And that is well. O God! how I have loved you, And what a bloody flower did Love bear! [Comes back to the table.] What if I drank these juices, and so ceased? Were it not better than to wait till Death Come to my bed with all his serving men, Remorse, disease, old age, and misery? I wonder does one suffer much: I think That I am very young to die like this, But so it must be. Why, why should I die? He will escape to-night, and so his blood Will not be on my head. No, I must die; I have been guilty, therefore I must die; He loves me not, and therefore I must die: I would die happier if he would kiss me, But he will not do that. I did not know him. I thought he meant to sell me to the Judge; That is not strange; we women never know Our lovers till they leave us.

They are ten, Ten against one, and they possess your life. They call me Duchess here in Padua.

5000|$|Dr. George Hill Hodel, Jr. {{came under}} police {{scrutiny}} in October 1949, when his 14-year-old daughter, Tamar, {{accused him of}} molesting her. Despite three witnesses testifying that they had seen Hodel having sex with Tamar, he was acquitted in December 1949. The trial led the LAPD to include Hodel, a physician specializing in sexually transmitted diseases, among its many suspects in the Dahlia case. Police put Hodel under surveillance from February 18 to March 27, 1950, to ascertain whether he could be implicated in the murder. In the surviving transcripts of microphone recordings, Hodel was heard making highly incriminating statements.Supposin' I did kill the Black Dahlia. They couldn't prove it now.

5000|$|Let's Build a World Together {{contains}} more songs celebrating {{the fairy tale}} romance of country music's royal couple featuring producer Billy Sherrill's Phil Spector-influenced production. Regardless of what the reality may have been, country fans couldn't {{get enough of the}} pair who appeared to be living every word they sang. As Eugene Chadbourne of AllMusic astutely observes, [...] "The chemistry that develops between partners in a male and female country music duo can sometimes be based on fantasy, as was obviously the case with Loretta Lynn and Ernest Tubb, who no country listener even imagined for a moment were romantically involved. Tammy Wynette and George Jones, on the other hand, did have a relationship." [...] The truth was not as idyllic as their fans preferred to imagine it. Years later, in the documentary Stand By Your Dream, Wynette recalled, [...] "It was very difficult on us, both of us being in the business and both of us being together twenty-four hours a day. We were constantly together. We never had any breathing room, no space...And Jones had a very bad drinking problem, and I knew that when we married but, you know, you always think, 'Oh shoot, he'll be so happy when he marries me and that'll all stop.' You think you can change somebody but you never can. And it wasn't all his fault...I nagged him about his drinkin' an awful lot because he has cirrhosis of the liver and the doctors told him that it was gonna kill him if he did not quit drinkin'. Well, you can't sit by and watch someone you love totally destroy themselves and not try and do something. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it in the wrong way but {{it was the only way}} I knew to do it at the time." ...|$|E

5000|$|Regarding {{the writing}} process for her lyrics, Holter noted, [...] "I {{basically}} just write stream of consciousness to a certain extent, I let the song kind of go where it wants to go.

[...] Both [...] "Sea Calls Me Home" [...] and [...] "Betsy on the Roof" [...] were written years prior to recording and often performed during Holter's live performances. [...] "Lucette Stranded on the Island" [...] was influenced by Colette's novella, Chance Acquaintances, while novelist Christopher Isherwood's recurring fictional character, Sally Bowles, was an influence in writing [...] "How Long?".|$|R
