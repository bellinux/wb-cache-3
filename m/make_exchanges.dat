50|$|Used as {{the basis}} for {{attracting}} mass appeal to purchasing a timeshare, is the idea of owners exchanging their week, either independently or through exchange agencies. There are several exchange agencies, but only two are frequently mentioned in the industry. They are the two largest: RCI and Interval International (II), which combined, have over 7,000 resorts. They have resort affiliate programs, and members can only exchange with affiliated resorts. It is most common for a resort to be affiliated with only one of the larger exchange agencies, although resorts with dual affiliations are not uncommon. The timeshare resort one purchases determines which of the exchange companies can be used to <b>make</b> <b>exchanges.</b> RCI and II charge a yearly membership fee, and additional fees for when they find an exchange for a requesting member, and bar members from renting weeks for which they already have exchanged.|$|E
5000|$|The {{museum was}} {{initially}} {{established as a}} purely scientific institution under the Department of Sciences and Letters, and in addition was required not to compete with anthropology museums. To secure its foundation, it had been essential to guarantee {{that it would not}} compete with pre-existing institutions. Thus, the ministerial document dated November 1877 that related to the initial form of the museum, the temporary Museum of Scientific Exhibitions, specified that items of historical or artistic interest whose provenance was either Italy, Greece, Egypt or the East would revert to the Louvre, prehistoric or Gallo-Roman items of French provenance would go to the Museum of Antiquities in Saint-Germain, and medallions, books, and manuscripts must be deposited in the Bibliothèque Nationale. The new museum was not permitted to accept objects of an anthropological or natural historical nature, nor to offer instruction; a proposal by Landrin for an [...] "expedition school" [...] was thus denied. However, the museum was able to <b>make</b> <b>exchanges</b> with other museums, both in France and in other countries.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the empirical relationship between corporate governance and information asymmetry across {{a range of}} French firms. Based on a cross-sectional analysis, our study of the empirical relationship between corporate governance and information asymmetry involved 160 companies over the years 2008 - 2010. Mechanisms of corporate governance include the characteristics of the board of directors. Our results seem to indicate a significant relationship between certain mechanisms of corporate governance and the information asymmetry of the French market. These mechanisms can reduce adverse selection costs, and <b>make</b> <b>exchanges</b> more transparent. These results suggest that firms with efficient corporate governance mechanisms may reduce informative asymmetry and improve transparency between investors. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This book {{provides}} {{a broad description}} of the development and (computational) application of many-electron approaches from a multidisciplinary perspective. In the context of studying many-electron systems Computer Science, Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics are all intimately interconnected. However, beyond a handful of communities working at the interface between these disciplines, {{there is still a}} marked separation of subjects. This book seeks to offer a common platform for possible exchanges between the various fields and to introduce the reader to perspectives for potential further developments across the disciplines. The rapid advances of modern technology will inevitably require substantial improvements in the approaches currently used, which will in turn <b>make</b> <b>exchanges</b> between disciplines indispensable. In essence this book is one of the very first attempts at an interdisciplinary approach to the many-electron problem...|$|E

40|$|This is an evaluative {{case study}} of a timebank, which is a {{localized}} system in which members <b>make</b> <b>exchanges</b> using hours of time as currency. In it, I ask two interconnected questions: First, is the timebank achieving its primary goals of revaluing people and skills, meeting material needs, and building community across and within different identities? Second, what can the attainment or failure of these goals elucidate about the viability and risks of taking an interstitial approach to the emancipatory social transformation of capitalism, particularly {{in the context of}} timebanking? Using in-depth interviews, surveys, and participant observation to conduct a qualitative program evaluation, I find that the timebank fails to meet what I identify to be the leadership's self-set goals. Employing the frameworks of emancipatory social transformation, social reproduction, and interstitial strategy, and the supporting theories of subjectivity and hegemony, I argue that because the timebank leadership depoliticizes the project and enables a volunteerist approach, the timebank not only fails to be interstitially transformative but also passively reproduces the very hegemonic social order that its goals, if enacted, hold the potential to interrupt...|$|E
3000|$|Due to the armistice, South Korea’s anti-communist Protestant leaders lost an {{opportunity}} for achieving reunification by force. When the war ended, they began attacking and disrupting various attempts for a peaceful reunification, inter-Korean exchanges, and reconciliation by stressing {{that they could not}} coexist with communism. As far as anti-communism was concerned, the National Council of Churches in Korea (NCCK) was no exception, even though the umbrella organ of relatively liberal denominations led the democratization movement during the period of military dictatorship. For instance, based on anti-communist spirit, the NCCK strongly supported the Korean government’s decision to dispatch military forces to fight against the Vietnamese communist-nationalists in the Vietnam War. 21 Afterward, the NCCK interrupted North Korean Christians’ efforts to <b>make</b> <b>exchanges</b> with the World Council of Churches and Korean Christians overseas. 22 These cases indicate that anti-communism took deep root among South Korean Protestants regardless of their theological differences. Leading Protestant activists against Park Jung-Hee’s dictatorship, including Kim Jae-Jun, Mun Ik-Hwan, and Jang Jun-Ha, were basically anti-communists, as well. Minjung Theology, the Korean version of the progressive praxis theology that strongly encouraged Christian social engagement, distanced itself from Marxism. 23 [...]...|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{activity of}} a society is learning. The informational model organized around the cognitive paradigm of processing information places the student in the situation of acquiring his own knowledge, which becomes therefore a permeable, open reality. The virtual character of education leads to a decentralization of the multiple bases of informing and knowing. Beside the internal sources, of the school, the trainee can connect to some alternative sources, from his cultural area, which he will reassemble according to the logic of his own interest. The new communication formulae modify the traditional scheme of the didactic communication, turning the individual or the learning group into a knowledge generator. They <b>make</b> <b>exchanges</b> and validate their own products of knowledge, amplifying the wish to learn and the motivation for a well-done thing.
