5|$|The first {{legislative}} session of Breathitt's administration {{was a disappointment}} to his faction. His youth and narrow margin of victory in the election undermined his authority. Further, the unexpected death of Richard P. Moloney, a key legislative leader, was a blow to Breathitt's ability to push his agenda through the General Assembly. The major accomplishment of the 1964 session was the approval of a $176million bond issue to increased funding for roads, public education, the state park system, and social services. Other minor accomplishments included passing a purchasing law, strengthening strip <b>mining</b> <b>regulations,</b> and improving benefits for teachers.|$|E
5|$|The {{inquiry report}} failed to {{identify}} a definite cause, although it was considered that the most likely cause was a spark from the signalling gear. It would have ignited the firedamp, exacerbated and fuelled by coal dust in the air. The report was critical of {{many aspects of the}} management's practices, and considered it had breached the <b>mining</b> <b>regulations</b> in respect of measuring and maintaining the air quality in the workings, and in the removal of coal dust from the tracks and walkways. The report pointed out that because the management had not implemented the changes needed to the ventilation fans as demanded by the Coal Mines Act 1911, the fans were unable to reverse the direction of the airflow, which would have blown the smoke out through the Lancaster shaft, although Redmayne and his colleagues held differing opinions on the advisability of reversing or stopping the airflow. The historian John H Brown, in his examination of the disaster, states that had the airflow been reversed, firedamp or afterdamp could have been extracted from some sectors into the blaze, causing another explosion.|$|E

These and other issues demand scrutiny, and the miners’ families deserve the answers.|$|E

40|$|There {{were serious}} changes in <b>mine</b> <b>regulations</b> in the Ottoman Empire {{along with the}} political, social and {{economic}} reforms of the 19 th century. The Land Code of 1858 effected <b>mine</b> <b>regulations</b> and new procedures in searching, digging and management processes were applied. These new arrangements were decided according to the European codes and regulations as in the other spheres of the Ottoman government in the 19 th century. However, this situation created new problems. In order to fix those newly created problems few more regulations were issued. For the nineteenth century, one can say that Ottoman mining was in a rapid change in terms of <b>mining</b> <b>regulation...</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{influx of}} {{people into the}} new colony {{required}} Douglas to act quickly in drawing up regulations and creating infrastructure. [...] Magistrates and constables were hired, <b>mining</b> <b>regulations</b> drawn up, and townsites surveyed at Yale, Hope and Fort Langley to discourage squatting on crown land. [...] In addition, roads were constructed into the areas of greatest mining exploration around Lillooet and Lytton. [...] The colony, however, was not immediately granted a representative colonial assembly, because of uncertainty {{as to whether the}} gold rush would yield a stable, settled population.

60|$|That {{was why he}} {{had bought}} the Canopus under {{somewhat}} peculiar circumstances, and extended the workings without concerning himself greatly as to whether every stipulation of the Crown <b>mining</b> <b>regulations</b> had been complied with, until the mine proved profitable, when it had appeared advisable not to court inquiry, which might result in the claim being jumped by applying for corrected records. It also explained the fact that although he had no safe at the ranch, he had brought up all the plans and papers relating to it from his Vancouver office, and kept them merely covered by certain dusty books. Nobody who might feel an illegitimate interest in them would, he argued, expect to find them there.|$|E
60|$|Most of {{the others}} laughed, but while there was no {{expression}} of sympathy it was significant that there was as little astonishment.

40|$|The {{case study}} of Debswana Diamond Company, {{a joint venture between}} the Botswana {{government}} and the De Beers Group of Companies, illustrates Botswana’s semi-directed model of <b>mining</b> <b>regulation.</b> Under this model, the Botswana government collects substantial mining revenues, which it invests in social spending because of a transparent and accountable governance structure. The government also uses its regulatory role to integrate the mining sector into national development plans. Through document analysis and interviews with government, mining and labour officials, this thesis concludes that to an extent the semi-directed model of <b>mining</b> <b>regulation</b> has mitigated the resource curse and contributed to development in Botswana. The country, however, continues to face significant challenges regarding economic diversification and employment.

It seemed {{advisable}} to let you know. The men seem inclined to find fault with everything just now, and if it came out that Ingleby's claim had not been sequestrated when it should have been they might get it into their heads that you had winked at the irregularity because you were on good terms with him.

They are really not unreasonable. In the first place we want Tomlinson tried here by his peers, which, {{although}} a little unusual, could, I think, be done. If Captain Esmond can prove him guilty, we will give him up, and he can get a regular court to confirm the verdict. Then we ask immunity for the men who held up the outpost, and one or two trifling modifications of the <b>mining</b> <b>regulations</b> which are probably within the discretion afforded you by your commission." ...|$|E
60|$|The Canadian is, as a rule, {{a sturdy}} imperialist with {{democratic}} tendencies, {{a type of}} citizen which would elsewhere probably be thought an anachronism. There were, however, as Sewell had pointed out, a good many men in the North just then who had no country, and a vague unrest and discontent, that once or twice came near producing unpleasant results, spread sporadically across the wilderness that season. Nobody {{was pleased with the}} <b>mining</b> <b>regulations,</b> and there were quiet Canadian bushmen who thought the drafting of detachments of the Northwest Police into that country not only unnecessary, but a reflection upon them. There were also other men, who had carried the memory of their wrongs with them from lands ruled by the mailed fist, to whom this symbol of imperial authority was as a red rag to a bull, and here and there a heavy responsibility was laid on the agents of the Crown.|$|E

50|$|In {{medieval and}} early modern times, the state <b>mining</b> <b>regulations</b> obliged mining {{companies}} to employ pit officials for {{the supervision of}} their mines.

With the reform of mining law in the years from 1851 to 1865, there was a change in the official status of the Steiger. The Steiger was no longer a state official, but a private officer. Despite this change, Steigers continued to be employed by the mining authority.|$|E
