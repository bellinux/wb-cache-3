2500|$|In the {{original}} 1969 edition of A Gamut of Games, simultaneous connection {{was described as}} a draw. In the second edition, the rules were changed to declare this a win for the player <b>moving.</b> <b>Here</b> is Sid Sackson's note in the preface to the second edition: [...] "Claude Soucie and I are all that remains of N.Y.G.A. At his request, I have corrected an error in the rules for LINES OF ACTION, eliminating possible draws." [...] However, despite the intention of the inventor of LOA, most present day tournaments including the World Championships at the Mind Sports Olympiad score simultaneous connection as a draw.|$|E

I’ll hand another fifty to Mr. Archer, {{and ask him to}} send you twenty pounds at a time.

60|$|In {{half an hour}} afterwards, {{the immense}} {{concourse}} had dispersed; the moon was looking calmly down upon her wrinkled image in the river; and half-a-dozen men and boys, with bits of lighted candle in their hands: <b>moving</b> <b>here</b> and there, in search of anything worth having, {{that might have been}} dropped in the press: had the whole scene to themselves.|$|E

"Your {{definition}} {{would certainly}} be right, if only I knew that the light by means of which the observer at M perceives the lightning flashes travels along the length A arrow M with the same velocity as along the length B arrow M.

60|$|Even I, thick-headed {{and dull}} of vision as I am, {{understood}} {{on this morning}} that some change was near at hand. The red-coats were <b>moving</b> <b>here</b> and there hurriedly, like bees whose hive has been disturbed. There was a great gathering of horses nearby the river bank, and among them, to my grief and anxiety, was my own colt Silver Heels; baggage wagons were being drawn down to the shore, and officers rode to and fro in hot haste, seemingly giving little heed as to what might be {{going on in the}} fortifications.|$|E
60|$|Seagraves, an impressionable {{young man}} (junior {{editor of the}} Boomtown Spike), threw himself down on the sod, pulled his hat rim down over his eyes, and looked away over the plain. It was {{the second year of}} Boom-town's existence, and Seagraves had not yet grown restless under its monotony. Around him the gophers played saucily. Teams were <b>moving</b> <b>here</b> and there across the sod, with a {{peculiar}} noiseless, effortless motion that made them seem as calm, lazy, and unsubstantial as the mist through which they made their way; even the sound of passing wagons was a sort of low, well-fed, self-satisfied chuckle.|$|E
40|$|Electromagnetic {{cloaking}} {{represents one}} of the most fascinating possibilities enabled by metamaterials and metasurfaces.

60|$|We {{proceeded}} cautiously, {{and soon}} saw other forms fleeing before us and disappearing, as we supposed, around corners and into houses. And now suddenly finding ourselves upon {{the edge of}} a wide, open public square, we saw in the dim light--for a tall steeple obscured the moon--the forms of vehicles, horses, and men <b>moving</b> <b>here</b> and there. But before, in our astonishment, we could say a word one to the other, the moon moved past the steeple, and in its bright light we could see none of the signs of life and traffic which had just astonished us.|$|E

To hear his quick step <b>moving</b> <b>here</b> and moving there from early morning to late at night, and yet never to catch {{so much as a}} glimpse of him--it's more than I can stand. My husband is as nervous over it as I am, but he is out at his work all day, while I get no rest from it. What is he hiding for? What has he done? Except for the girl, I am all alone in the house with him, and it's more than my nerves can stand." ...|$|E
60|$|The retreat was superbly conducted. It was {{necessary}} to move by several roads, but {{the whole of the}} baggage, artillery, and troops arrived punctually the next morning at Rothenburg, just at the hour when Daun's army moved down to the attack of the camp where he had been the evening before. Austrian scouting parties were sent out in all directions, but no certain news could be obtained as to the direction of the Prussian march. The baggage waggons had been seen, <b>moving</b> <b>here</b> and there, but it was four days before Daun was able to learn for certain what had become of him, having until then believed that he must have made for Glogau, to join Frederick.|$|E

6000|$|While <b>moving</b> <b>here</b> {{and there}} she fancied that she heard a slight noise out-of-doors, and stood still. Surely it was a tapping at the window. A thought entered her mind, and burned her cheek. He had come to that window before; yet was it {{possible}} that he should dare to do so now! All the servants were in bed, and in the ordinary course of affairs she would have retired also. Then she remembered that on stepping in by the casement and closing it, she had not fastened the window-shutter, so that a streak of light from the interior of the room might have revealed her vigil to an observer on the lawn. How all things conspired against her keeping faith with Grace! ...|$|E
60|$|While Chebron {{went toward}} the temple, which {{was but a}} short {{distance}} from the house, Jethro and Amuba sat down by the wall close to the gate so that none could leave it without their knowledge. But beyond servants and visitors no one came out. At ten o'clock they heard the bolts of the gates fastened, but remained where they were until near midnight, when Chebron joined them. He had spent the time wandering from court to court of the temple, but beyond a solitary priest <b>moving</b> <b>here</b> and there replenishing the lamps of the altars he had seen no one, and had been himself entirely unnoticed. Amuba and Chebron were both inclined to be dispirited at the want of success of their watching, but Jethro chid them for their impatience.|$|E
60|$|Baron Conrad and Baroness Matilda sat {{together}} at their morning meal below their raised seats stretched the long, heavy wooden table, loaded with coarse food--black bread, boiled cabbage, bacon, eggs, a great chine from a wild boar, sausages, {{such as we}} eat nowadays, and flagons and jars of beer and wine, Along the board sat ranged {{in the order of}} the household the followers and retainers. Four or five slatternly women and girls served the others as they fed noisily at the table, <b>moving</b> <b>here</b> and there behind the men with wooden or pewter dishes of food, now and then laughing at the jests that passed or joining in the talk. A huge fire blazed and crackled and roared in the great open fireplace, before which were stretched two fierce, shaggy, wolfish-looking hounds. Outside, the rain beat upon the roof or ran trickling from the eaves, {{and every now and then}} a chill draught of wind would breathe through the open windows of the great black dining-hall and set the fire roaring.|$|E
