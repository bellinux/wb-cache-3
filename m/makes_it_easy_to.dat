5|$|Copper is used {{to create}} stills for distilling spirits, for example to make whisky. It's {{malleability}} <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> bend into the various shapes required and allows considerable flexibility in the shaping of the still and associated pipework; the metal also reacts with undesirable sulfur-containing components in the vapor and distillate making for a cleaner product.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} saprobic, and is found growing in {{groups on the}} ground or on moss-covered {{decaying}} wood, especially amongst fallen pine needles. In North America, fruit bodies appear in the spring and summer, and are fairly common; in Britain, the fungus fruits from winter to spring, and is rare. Its small size and dark color <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> overlook.|$|E
5|$|All {{species of}} cone snails are venomous and can sting painfully when handled, {{although}} many species {{are too small}} to pose much of a risk to humans, and only a few fatalities have been reliably reported. Their venom is a complex mixture of toxins, some fast-acting and others slower but deadlier. The effects of individual cone-shell toxins on victims' nervous systems are so precise as to be useful tools for research in neurology, and the small size of their molecules <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> synthesize them.|$|E
50|$|Proponents claim a {{particular}} language <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> express and understand concepts in one area, {{and more difficult}} in others. An example can be taken from the way various programming languages <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> write certain kinds of programs and harder to write others.|$|R
5000|$|Compared to environments {{where the}} {{programmer}} needs to avoid or work around hazards, {{use of a}} non-pipelined processor may <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> program and to train programmers. The non-pipelined processor also <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> predict the exact timing of a given sequence of instructions.|$|R

5|$|Navigator {{training}} was historically interwoven with culture and ritual. Great discretion {{had to be}} shown in candidate selection so that the knowledge preserved through oral tradition would have the greatest chance of survival. A master navigator's rank was equal or superior to a village chief's rank. Prudent navigation relies on no single technique but instead synthesizes position from multiple inputs. Underway, this constant synthesis <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> spot the navigator by being the one with red eyes from sleep deprivation.|$|E
5|$|The {{skin of a}} {{tiger shark}} can {{typically}} range from blue to light green with a white or light-yellow underbelly. The advantage {{of this is that}} when it is hunting for its prey, when prey looks at the shark from above, the shark will be camouflaged since the water below is darker. And when prey is below the shark and looks up, of course because of the sun, it is lighter so that the light underbelly will also camouflage the shark. This is known as countershading. Dark spots and stripes are most visible in young sharks and fade as the shark matures. Its head is somewhat wedge-shaped, which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> turn quickly to one side. They have small pits on the snout which hold electroreceptors called the ampullae of Lorenzini, which enable them to detect electric fields, including the weak electrical impulses generated by prey, which helps them to hunt. Tiger sharks also have a sensory organ called a lateral line which extends on their flanks down most of the length of their sides. The primary role of this structure is to detect minute vibrations in the water. These adaptations allow the tiger shark to hunt in darkness and detect hidden prey.|$|E

50|$|Temporal Raster Plots <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> show {{time-based}} relations {{within a}} large sets of time-interval data and often <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> recognize local maxima and minima. Assuming the chosen time division {{is related to}} the events, <b>it</b> is also <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> recognize global and local patterns, such as recurrent events.|$|R

25|$|The {{peculiar}} morphology of stalk-eyed flies <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> {{identify their}} fossils (e.g. in amber); one prehistoric genus {{that has been}} discovered in that form is Prosphyracephala.|$|E

25|$|The {{bright star}} Spica <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> locate Virgo, {{as it can}} be found by {{following}} the curve of the Big Dipper/Plough to Arcturus in Boötes and continuing from there in the same curve ("follow the arc to Arcturus and speed on to Spica").|$|E
25|$|The {{road network}} in Sha Tin is well {{developed}} to provide efficient cross-town and local access traffic. Connection between Sha Tin and Kowloon mainly {{relies on the}} Lion Rock Tunnel, Tate's Cairn Tunnel, Shing Mun Tunnel and Tai Po Road which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> reach from many areas of Kowloon {{as well as from}} Tsuen Wan.|$|E
25|$|There are 535 {{access points}} where the Pennine Way intersects with other public rights of way. The route is also crossed by many roads and passes through many villages and towns with good public transport. This <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> sample a short {{section of the}} trail, or to split the Pennine Way across several {{holidays}} or long weekends.|$|E

25|$|Another issue {{arises when}} the sample for {{detection}} {{is a relatively}} large molecule, such as DNA or protein. In the application for large molecule, clogging is a concern because {{the small size of}} the nanochannel <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> happen. A low friction coating at inner surface of the channel is desired to avoid blocking of fluid channels in this application.|$|E
25|$|Most modern domes {{are built}} from thin {{aluminium}} sections with ribs providing a supporting structure behind. The use of aluminium <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> perforate the dome {{with thousands of}} tiny holes. This reduces the reflectivity of sound back to the audience (providing better acoustic characteristics), lets a sound system project through the dome from behind (offering sound that seems to come from appropriate directions related to a show), and allows air circulation through the projection surface for climate control.|$|E
25|$|Owners of the Yugo {{and related}} {{models in the}} former Yugoslavia benefit from a ready supply of {{inexpensive}} spare parts due to general continuity in the car's design; local mechanics' ready familiarity with the Yugo also lowers the cost of ownership, since Yugos are so common and are even used as practice cars for apprentice mechanics. Also, {{the simplicity of the}} car's engine <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> fix, and many Yugoslavian owners tended to fix the car themselves. All parts for the Yugo are readily available in the United States.|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{provides a}} cross-refrerence between absolute section {{numbers and the}} corresponding symbolic names used for cross-references within the Working Paper. Its purpose is <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> replace absolute section numbers by their corresponding names, which in turn will <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> renumber sections in future versions of the Working Paper...|$|R
5000|$|Allowing {{bend in the}} knees: this {{lowers the}} center of gravity and the pelvis is brought closer to the ground. It can {{decrease}} stretch in the hamstrings, and <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> pick a weight off the ground. <b>It</b> also <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> set the weight down as dropping it would be riskier.|$|R
5000|$|In 2016, {{the law was}} {{reformed}} again, with a {{new focus}} on lack of consent rather than {{the resistance of the}} victim. [...] The new law also classifies groping as a sex crime, <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> deport migrants who commit sex offences, and <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> prosecute assaults committed by a large group.|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} method applied in pseudoscientific {{language}} comparisons is to search {{two or more}} languages for words that seem similar in their sound and meaning. While similarities of this kind often seem convincing to laypersons, linguistic scientists consider this kind of comparison to be unreliable for two primary reasons. First, the method applied is not well-defined: the criterion of similarity is subjective and thus not subject to verification or falsification, which {{is contrary to the}} principles of the scientific method. Second, the large size of all languages' vocabulary and a relatively limited inventory of articulated sounds used by most languages <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> find coincidentally similar words between languages.|$|E
25|$|This is the {{standard}} process used by National Mapping Agencies. It uses a plastic film, which is coated on one side with a photo-opaque film. The layer is removed with a scribing tool or scalpel to produce a negative image. One sheet of film is needed for each solid colour, and one for each screen, usually requiring about ten sheets of film altogether. The map is drawn at final map scale, and the negatives are printed with high quality dot screens to produce the five film positives for printing. The process <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> produce high quality maps, but it does require a number of specialist tools.|$|E
25|$|Beyond the {{distributions}} and tools, the openSUSE Project {{provides a}} web portal for community involvement. The community develops openSUSE collaboratively with its corporate sponsors through the Open Build Service, openQA, writing documentation, designing artwork, fostering discussions on open mailing lists and in Internet Relay Chat channels, {{and improving the}} openSUSE site through its wiki interface. openSUSE offers a stable base with its openSUSE Leap version. Users that prefer more up-to-date free software can use its rolling release distribution Tumbleweed. Users can also use the Open Build Service. Moreover, the flexibility of openSUSE <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> re-purpose for specific goals like running a web- or mail server.|$|E
