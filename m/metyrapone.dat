Therefore, if 11-deoxycortisol levels do not rise and remain less than 7 µg/dl (202 nmol/l) and ACTH rises, then it is highly suggestive of adrenal insufficiency.

He also described Liddle's syndrome, a genetic syndrome causing high blood pressure. Liddle developed the dexamethasone suppression test for assessing adrenal function and the <b>metyrapone</b> test for pituitary reserve. He discovered a method for measuring aldosterone levels in urine and pioneered the use of spironolactone in the treatment of high blood pressure. He also discovered that certain cancers, especially of the lungs, can secrete ACTH, producing a paraneoplastic Cushing's syndrome. Based on his research into paraneoplastic syndromes, he coined the term [...] "ectopic hormone secretion".|$|E

Aminoglutethimide (3-(4-aminophenyl)-3-ethylpiperidine-2,6-dione), which was originally introduced as an anticonvulsant in 1960, is closely related structurally to amphenone B, and following its introduction, was found to cause adrenal insufficiency in patients due to inhibition of cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme and suppression of corticosteroid production.

40|$|International audienceMetyrapone, a {{cytochrome}} P(450) inhibitor used {{to inhibit}} corticosterone synthesis, triggers biological markers {{of stress and}} also reduces stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors. To address these controversial effects, 6 separate investigations were carried out. In a first set of investigations, abdominal temperature (T(abd)), spontaneous locomotor activity (A(S)) and electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded in freely moving rats treated with either saline or 150 mg kg(- 1) <b>metyrapone.</b> An increase in T(abd) and A(S) occurred in saline rats, while, <b>metyrapone</b> rats exhibited an immediate decrease, both variables returning to basal values 5 h later. Concomitantly, the EEG spectral power increased in the gamma and beta 2 bands and decreased in the alpha frequency band, and the EMG spectral power increased. This finding suggests that <b>metyrapone</b> depressed stress-induced physiological response while arousing the animal. In a second step, restraint stress was applied 5 h after injection. <b>Metyrapone</b> significantly blunted the stress-induced T(abd) and A(S) rise, without affecting the brain c-fos mRNA increase.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The annual {{death rate}} of {{patients}} with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is high (3 %). Many deaths of children are sudden and unexplained. Sleep apneas have been suggested {{to play a role}} in sudden deaths. Recently, we discovered that 60 % {{of patients with}} PWS suffer from central adrenal insufficiency (CAI) during stress. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to study the relationship between CAI and sleep-related breathing disorders. DESIGN: In 20 children with PWS who underwent a <b>metyrapone</b> test (30 mg/kg at 2330 h), sleep-related breathing was evaluated by polysomnography before the <b>metyrapone</b> test. In addition, we recorded sleep-related breathing in 10 children with PWS during their <b>metyrapone</b> test. CAI was diagnosed when ACTH levels during the <b>metyrapone</b> test were below 33 pmol/liter at 0730 h. All tests were performed during healthy condition. Setting: The study was conducted in a pediatric intensive care unit and specialized sleep center. RESULTS: Median (interquartile range) age was 8. 4 yr (6. 5 - 10. 2). After <b>metyrapone</b> administration, median (interquartile range) central apnea index (number/hour) increased significantly from 2. 2 (0. 4 - 4. 7) to 5. 2 (1. 5 - 7. 9) (P = 0. 007). The increase tended to be higher in children with CAI [2. 8 (2. 0 - 3. 9) vs. 1. 0 (- 0. 2 to 2. 6); P = 0. 09]. During polysomnography before the <b>metyrapone</b> test, sleep-related breathing was worse in children with CAI, who had a significantly higher central apnea index and tended to have a lower minimum oxygen saturation compared to those without CAI (P = 0. 03 and P = 0. 07).

The P 450 IA and IIB subfamilies were not detectable (less than 5 pmol/mg of microsomal protein) in the livers of control rats, but administration of BNF resulted in the P 450 IA subfamily comprising more than 80 % of the total hepatic cytochrome P- 450. Administration of PB and <b>metyrapone</b> to rats did not elevate the level of this subfamily but elevated the levels of the P 450 IIB subfamily to 60 % and 30 % respectively of the total. Thus <b>metyrapone</b> is a 'PB-like' inducer. However, in contrast with their effects in vivo, treatment with PB and <b>metyrapone</b> of rat hepatocytes did not elevate the proportion of the P 450 IIB subfamily relative to that in untreated cells but rather, like BNF, increased the P 450 IA subfamily.
