5|$|After his {{retirement}} as a player, Harvey took up umpiring. His initial first-class match was in 197475, when he officiated in Queensland’s home match against Victoria {{late in the}} season; {{at the time the}} host team provided both umpires. The following year, he was selected for four first-class <b>matches,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> which was against the touring West Indies. He also officiated in his first List A match, presiding over the final of Australia's domestic limited-overs tournament, which Queensland hosted against Western Australia. The following two seasons were similar; Harvey stood in four first-class matches including one against a touring international team, and one List A match, both of which were quarter-finals.|$|E
5|$|Ibrox Park, as it {{was known}} between 1899 and 1997, is almost {{completely}} different from the Ibrox Stadium of today. It followed the model of most Scottish stadiums of the time, comprising an oval track around the pitch, with a pavilion and one stand along one side. The ground had a capacity of 40,000. Celtic Park, Ibrox and Hampden Park all competed {{with each other to}} host Scottish Cup Finals and Scotland <b>matches,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> which could generate up to £1,000 in revenue for the host club. To aid their chances of gaining that revenue, Rangers constructed a large terracing, holding 36,000 people, behind the western goalmouth. The terracing, designed by Archibald Leitch, was formed by wooden planks bolted onto a framework made of iron. A similar wooden terracing was constructed at the eastern end, giving a total capacity of 75,000.|$|E
5|$|On September 29, Well Dunn began another {{series of}} matches against The Bushwhackers. The feud lasted the {{remainder}} of the year, although Barry Horowitz substituted for Steven Dunn in several matches when Dunn was unable to appear. The Bushwhackers were victorious in the majority of matches, but Well Dunn won occasional <b>matches.</b> <b>One</b> <b>of</b> these matches was featured on the Coliseum Video release Wham Bam Bodyslam, and another two were televised on Monday Night Raw. During one of the Monday Night Raw matches, The Bushwhackers were accompanied by ring announcer Howard Finkel, who had a long-standing rivalry with Wippleman. Finkel and Wippleman had an argument during the match that led to a tuxedo match, in which Finkel was declared the winner after stripping Wippleman to his underwear.|$|E

Samantha realizes that Joe found {{the crime scene}} of Lizzy's murder; the tennis courts at her school. Kate and Megan study her body and find a hand impression on her back, which <b>matches</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> her friends Heather Clayton (Meg Chambers Steedle). Heather killed Lizzy after she broke her finger during a lacrosse game. Lizzy's body was found elsewhere, meaning Heather had help moving the body, so Megan finds out that Lou helped Heather. Lou also admits killing Joe, as he was getting {{too close to the}} truth. After they arrest them, Megan revisits her mother Joan, asking to exhume her father’s body. Joan declines the request, telling Megan to leave him be. Megan and Samantha revisit Helen and Becky, revealing that Joe had an undiagnosed brain disorder, causing the emotional distance from the two, telling them that Joe helped solve the Lizzy Adler case.|$|E

25|$|For the 2011–12 season, Paris {{received}} a rookie {{contract with the}} Western Australian Cricket Association (WACA), which was maintained for the following season. Having missed portions of the previous season due to a stress fracture in his foot, he debuted at state level {{towards the end of}} the 2012–13 edition of the Ryobi One-Day Cup, taking 1/35 against New South Wales. Signed to the Perth Scorchers for the 2013–14 season, he debuted for the team at the 2013 edition of the Champions League Twenty20, taking two wickets from four <b>matches</b> (<b>one</b> <b>of</b> which was abandoned due to rain). These wickets each came in the match against the Otago Volts, which was his Twenty20 debut. He took wickets with his first two balls, with his first over a double-wicket maiden, but conceded 50 runs from his final three overs to finish with 2/50 for the match. At grade cricket level, Paris plays for Claremont–Nedlands.|$|E
25|$|The Redskins' {{fortunes}} {{continued to}} slide in 2009, as they lost {{two of the}} first four <b>matches,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> which was a 19-14 defeat {{at the hands of}} the Lions, a team that had not won a game since December 2007. After that, they lost to Carolina on the road and Kansas City at home, the latter match handing another victory to a winless team. On Monday Night Football, the Redskins lost to Philadelphia in a game where Jim Zorn was temporarily relieved of his duties by offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis. In Week 10, they inflicted a surprise defeat on the Denver Broncos before losing two divisional matches to Dallas and Philadelphia. The Week 13 game against an undefeated Saints team proved another surprise. The Redskins managed to tie at the end of regulation, and in overtime had a chance to break New Orleans' winning streak. However, kicker Shaun Suisham missed a field goal that would have given them the victory. On their next possession, the Saints scored a FG and won the game 33-30. Suisham was cut after the game and signed with Dallas (his original team). The Redskins then routed Oakland in Week 14 before losing their last three games to finish 4-12. The second match with the Cowboys ended in a 16-0 shutout, making for only the second season since 1970 where Washington lost all of its divisional matches. Jim Zorn was fired and replaced by Mike Shanahan afterwards.|$|E

Ben Kaplan (Alex Lanipekun) follows Firefly to a payphone, and Malcolm traces where he is calling. Adam and Lucas arrive at the house Sullivan is being held and successfully rescues him.|$|E
