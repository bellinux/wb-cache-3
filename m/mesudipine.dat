40|$|The {{effects of}} several calcium {{antagonistic}} drugs (slow channel blockers), <b>mesudipine,</b> FR- 34235 (nilvadipine), nifedipine, and verapamil, were compared on the naturally-occurring slow action potentials (APs) of the isolated spontaneously-contracting sinoatrial (SA) -node of the rabbit. <b>Mesudipine,</b> at 1 X 10 (- 8) M, {{had little or}} no effect on the AP parameters and beating frequency. At 1 X 10 (- 7) M, <b>mesudipine</b> depressed the amplitude, + Vmax and frequency of the APs. A higher concentration of <b>mesudipine</b> (3 X 10 (- 7) M) completely blocked the slow APs. The concentration of FR- 34235 required for 50 % depression of Vmax was 3 X 10 (- 8) M, and complete block required 1 X 10 (- 7) M. The verapamil and nifedipine concentrations required for complete block were 1 X 10 (- 6) M and 1 X 10 (- 7) M, respectively. The cells blocked by these drugs were depolarized to about - 40 mV. Cells blocked and depolarized by the drugs responded to intensive field stimulation with a transient after-hyperpolarization, followed by damped oscillations. When [Ca]o was elevated from 1. 8 mM to 5. 4 mM, full block required a higher concentration of <b>mesudipine</b> (1 X 10 (- 6) M) and FR- 34235 (1 X 10 (- 6) M). The order of potency of the drugs tested was: nifedipine = FR- 34235 greater than <b>mesudipine</b> greater than verapamil. The effects of <b>mesudipine,</b> FR- 34235, and nifedipine were easily reversible upon washout for 10 min, whereas those of verapamil required longer periods. The results indicate that the slow channel blockers, <b>mesudipine,</b> FR- 34235, nifedipine, and verapamil depress the APs and automaticity of the SA-node...|$|E
