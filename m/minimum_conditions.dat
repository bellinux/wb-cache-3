5|$|The draft-Constitution {{was to be}} {{subjected}} to a referendum on 8 August 1797, after a very lively campaign in which the French ambassador Noël weighed in with a supportive appeal. This probably contributed to the resounding defeat of the proposal (108,761 votes to 27,995). The Assembly was back at square one. At this moment in time foreign events {{in the form of the}} 18 Fructidor coup of general Pierre Augereau intervened. This brought the more radical faction to power in France, which proved to be ultimately less patient with the vagaries of the Dutch political process, and more prone to intervene. Elections for a second National Assembly returned one in which the balance of power had shifted to the unitarists in the Fall of 1797. Nevertheless, the federalists managed to retain control of the new constitutional commission by a bare majority. This led to more dawdling and the unitarists in the Assembly now came with their own proposal in the form of the Declaration of 43 on 12 December 1797, containing a nine-point manifesto concerning the <b>minimum</b> <b>conditions</b> to which the new constitution should conform.|$|E

50|$|If further {{refinement}} is necessary, the <b>minimum</b> <b>condition</b> grade {{should also}} {{take into account}} the likely failure mechanism - if failure of an asset is likely to occur very slowly and can be monitored, then a <b>minimum</b> <b>condition</b> of 2 or 3 is unlikely to be required - a minimum of CG4 can probably be justified. Conversely an asset that is liable to a fast failure mode with little warning will likely require a higher <b>minimum</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|R

2500|$|In 1868, the Victorian {{registered}} schooner Daphne chartered by Ross Lewin and skippered by John Daggett recruited islanders {{from the}} islands of Tanna, Erromango, Efate, Loyalty and Banks as indentured labour for employment on Queensland sugarcane fields. [...] This was under Queensland’s Polynesian Labourers Act. [...] That Act required a ship to have a license to undertake that work. [...] The license required the vessel to uphold certain <b>minimum</b> <b>conditions</b> as {{to the state and}} fitness of the vessel to carry labourers. [...] The license for the Daphne was for a maximum of 58 labourers that could be conveyed to Queensland on each voyage.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{increasing}} awareness that {{a greater understanding}} and emphasis of ecosystem resilience is required to reach the goal of sustainable development. A similar conclusion is drawn by Perman et al. who use resilience to describe one of 6 concepts of sustainability; [...] "A sustainable state is one which satisfies <b>minimum</b> <b>conditions</b> for ecosystem resilience through time". Resilience science has been evolving over the past decade, expanding beyond ecology to reflect systems of thinking in fields such as economics and political science. And, {{as more and more}} people move into densely populated cities, using massive amounts of water, energy, and other resources, the need to combine these disciplines to consider the resilience of urban ecosystems and cities is of paramount importance.|$|E
2500|$|Lord Brabazon {{reported}} first, in February 1951, {{making a}} number of recommendations regarding the lighting of airfields in poor weather conditions, the measurement of visibility and the setting of minimum weather conditions for landing. While the accident report could not establish for certain the precise cause of the accident, it concluded that the pilot had probably intentionally descended below the decision height, only aborting the landing when the aircraft entered the fog bank {{at an altitude of}} less than [...] Alice Steen, the hostess who had survived, had reported to the accident inquiry that the pilot Captain Clayton came back into the cabin and told her {{that they would not be}} landing at Northolt but at London Airport instead where the visibility was it was noted by the inquiry that Clayton had been told [...] on the radio. It was also noted that BEA's operating manual was confusing as to whether the decision heights stated were compulsory or advisory only, and Monckton recommended that aircraft be prohibited from landing where the visibility was significantly below the <b>minimum</b> <b>conditions</b> set by the operator. The recommendations of both Brazabon and Monckton were all implemented.|$|E

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{took off}} from Heathrow at 09:48 GMT. At 12:09, the aircraft was 4th in line to land at Bordeaux. At 12:28, a weather report for Bordeaux was transmitted to the aircraft. This stated [...] "Visibility 1500 metres, 10/10 60–100 metres, WSW 20km, Q.F.E. 1007.6". The direction of landing was given as 235°. By 12:30, the aircraft was next in line to land. At 1240, priority was given to a Royal Air Force Avro York, which was flying on only three engines. The aircraft was ordered to fly a circuit of the airfield whilst the York landed. At 1254, the York landed, but had to backtrack along the runway because the perimeter track was unserviceable. [...] At 12:58, the captain asked for the weather at Toulouse. At 12:59, the weather at Toulouse {{was sent to the}} aircraft. This stated [...] "Ceiling 300 metres, visibility 2km, wind E 10km". With this report, the captain was informed that he was next in line to land at Bordeaux. The captain then told air traffic control that he was diverting because the weather was below the <b>minimum</b> <b>conditions</b> permissible and asked for the weather at Toulouse. In evidence given to the enquiry, this was corroborated by the crew of British European Airways Dakota G-AGZX, which confirmed that the Toulouse weather was asked for. However, the radio operator recorded in his logbook [...] "1300 hrs, set course for London". The aircraft turned on a heading back to England but then changed course for Paris. At 13:08, the weather at Bordeaux had deteriorated and the Q.G.O. message was sent to the aircraft, indicating that it was now prohibited from landing at Bordeaux.|$|E

For G = Q∞ i= 1 H Ai, where H and each Ai is infinite cyclic, we identify exactly when each of these two cases (λ(G) = and λ(G) = H) occurs.
