50|$|The 8"/55 <b>Mark</b> 71 <b>gun</b> was {{a single}} gun {{adaptation}} of the 8"/55 <b>Mark</b> 16 <b>gun</b> found in triple turrets on Des Moines class cruisers. The prototype gun mount weighed 86 tons and was approximately 20 percent heavier than the 5"/54 caliber <b>Mark</b> 42 <b>gun</b> it replaced. The prototype could fire ten to twelve rounds per minute from a 75-round automatic ready service magazine for semi-fixed ammunition when operated by one man. A specially modified Mark 155 ballistic computer provided 8"/55 ballistics for Hulls <b>Mark</b> 68 <b>gun</b> fire control system.|$|R

50|$|The AN/SPG-53 was a United States Navy gun fire-control radar used in {{conjunction}} with the <b>Mark</b> 68 <b>gun</b> fire-control system. It was used with the 5"/54 caliber <b>Mark</b> 42 <b>gun</b> system aboard s, s, s, Farragut-class destroyers, s, s as well as others.|$|R
500|$|These {{ships were}} the first to carry the new breech-loading (BL) 13.5-inch <b>Mark</b> V <b>gun.</b> This gun was {{developed}} as the RN believed that the preceding 12-inch <b>Mark</b> XI <b>gun</b> could not be further developed and that a new gun of an increased bore was needed to deal with the longer ranges at which combat was expect to occur and the need for greater penetration and destructive effect. The <b>Mark</b> V <b>gun</b> had a muzzle velocity about [...] lower than the <b>Mark</b> XI <b>gun,</b> which greatly reduced the wear in the barrel. Despite the reduction in velocity, the gun's range was about [...] greater because the much heavier 13.5-inch shell retained its velocity longer than the lighter and smaller 12-inch shell.|$|R
5000|$|The 16"/45 caliber <b>Mark</b> 6 <b>gun</b> is a naval gun {{designed}} in 1936 by the United States Navy for their Treaty battleships. It {{was first introduced}} in 1941 aboard their s, replacing the originally intended 14"/50 caliber <b>Mark</b> B <b>guns</b> and was also used for the follow-up South Dakota class. These battleships carried nine guns in three three-gun turrets.

5000|$|These {{ships were}} {{originally}} armed with four 8 in/40 caliber <b>Mark</b> 5 <b>guns</b> in two twin turrets fore and aft. However, these were replaced with 8-inch/45 caliber <b>Mark</b> 6 <b>guns</b> by 1911 {{as a result}} of a gun bursting on Colorado in 1907. Fourteen 6 in/50 caliber <b>Mark</b> 6 <b>guns</b> were mounted in casemates on the sides. The large secondary armament, intended to combat torpedo boats, included eighteen 3 in/50 caliber rapid fire (RF) guns and twelve 3-pounder (...) RF guns. Two 1-pounder (...) saluting guns and two 18 in torpedo tubes were also carried.|$|R

500|$|These {{ships were}} the first to carry the new 50-calibre breech-loading (BL) [...] <b>Mark</b> XI <b>gun,</b> which was 5 calibres longer and had a muzzle {{velocity}} about [...] higher than the 45-calibre <b>Mark</b> X <b>gun</b> used in the earlier dreadnoughts. They had a reputation for drooping at the muzzle, which was believed to have an adverse effect at long range, but testing at sea showed the muzzle droop to be within normal tolerances and the accuracy at long range to be satisfactory. The increased muzzle velocity of the <b>Mark</b> XI <b>gun</b> gave it a longer range over the <b>Mark</b> X <b>gun</b> as well as increasing the distance at which it could penetrate 12 inches of armour from [...] using the same shell. The higher velocity reduced its service life by increasing the wear in the barrel.|$|R
