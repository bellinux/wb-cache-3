5|$|By {{reading the}} book, Gray learns that Léone {{is a victim}} of a Vampyr. Vampyrs can force humans into submission. The village doctor visits Léone at the manor, and Gray recognizes him as the old man he saw in the castle. The doctor tells Gray that a blood {{transfusion}} is needed and Gray offers his blood to save Léone. Exhausted from blood loss, Gray sleeps. He wakes sensing danger and rushes to Léone, where he surprises the doctor as he is attempting to poison the girl. The doctor flees the manor, and Gray finds that Gisèle is gone. Gray follows the doctor back to the castle, where Gray has a vision of himself being buried alive. After the vision subsides, he rescues Gisèle but the doctor escapes. The old servant of the manor finds Gray's Vampyr book and discovers that a Vampyr can be defeated by driving an iron bar through its heart. The servant meets Gray at Marguerite Chopin's grave behind the village Chapel. They open the grave and find the old woman perfectly preserved. They hammer a large <b>metal</b> <b>bar</b> through her heart, killing her. The village doctor is hiding in an old mill, but finds himself locked in a chamber where flour sacks are filled. The old servant arrives and activates the mill's machinery, filling the chamber with flour and suffocating the doctor. The curse of the Vampyr is lifted and Léone suddenly recovers. Gisèle and Gray cross a foggy river by boat and find themselves in a bright clearing.|$|E

25|$|The {{leader of}} the killers, Manghestu, took the {{genitals}} and told El Uisci {{that he intended to}} flay Minniti's body to make cigarette paper from the skin. El Uisci, again in Dagabur, said he had also witnessed the torture of another Italian soldier, who was mutilated, impaled and then transported on a stake, which pierced a <b>metal</b> <b>bar</b> that was lying on the back of two camels.|$|E

25|$|In addition, some {{units were}} {{constructed}} with eight sandboxes whilst normally each had four. X16 would also lack roof handrails over the cab area until fairly late, and XA class member had a <b>metal</b> <b>bar</b> welded underneath the cab windows across the full {{width of the}} cab. The reasons for these modification remain unclear, but {{are most likely to}} have been specially built for testing or experimental purposes.|$|E
25|$|Barbell {{earrings}} {{get their}} name from their resemblance to a barbell, generally {{coming in the}} form of a <b>metal</b> <b>bar</b> with an orb on either end. One of these orbs is affixed in place, while the other can be detached to allow the barbell to be inserted into a piercing. Several variations on this basic design exist, including barbells with curves or angles in the bar of the earring.|$|E
25|$|Security was {{frequently}} a problem, {{particularly in the}} club's latter years. There were several shootings {{inside and outside the}} club, and relations with the police and licensing authorities became troubled. When local magistrates and police visited the club in 1997, they witnessed a near-fatal assault on a man in the streets outside when 18-year-old Andrew Delahunty was hit over the head from behind with what looked like a <b>metal</b> <b>bar</b> before being pushed into the path of an on-coming car.|$|E

50|$|The {{conical refiner}} is a chamber with <b>metal</b> <b>bars</b> mounted around {{the inside of}} the container. The {{material}} to be refined is pumped into the chamber at high-pressure rate in order to create an abrasive effect as the material is forced through the machine, abraided by the <b>metal</b> <b>bars.</b> At {{the opposite end of the}} chamber the resulting pulp is pumped out.|$|R

25|$|Ireland, angered {{that he had}} {{received}} no publicity even after three murders, killed again within three days. He met and courted 33-year-old Andrew Collier, a housing warden, and the pair went to Collier's home in Dalston. After entering the flat there was a disturbance outside and both men {{went to the window}} to investigate. Ireland gripped a horizontal <b>metal</b> <b>bar</b> that ran across the window. He later forgot to wipe the bar for fingerprints during his usual cleanup phase. The police found these prints.|$|E
25|$|On May 23 at the Cleveland Indians, Demeter {{went back}} to catch a long fly ball from Leon Wagner, but {{as he tried to}} catch the ball, he hit his head on a padded <b>metal</b> <b>bar</b> on top of the outfield fence. The ball bounced off his glove and over the fence, {{resulting}} in a three-run home run for the Indians. Dressen remarked that he had seen the same incident occur with Billy Bruton on a three-run home run by Tommie Reynolds at Kansas City on April 30.|$|E
25|$|When the typist {{presses a}} key, a pawl {{on the key}} lever {{depresses}} a matching <b>metal</b> <b>bar</b> (interposer) for that key. The interposer, which is oriented front to back in the machine, has one or more short projections (lugs) protruding from its bottom edge. Each interposer has a unique combination of lugs, corresponding to the binary code for the desired character. Each interposer also has a tab that slots in between loose steel balls in a race, the size of balls and race selected precisely to leave a total gap barely larger than {{the width of the}} interposer tab, such that only one interposer tab can fit in the free space and thus only one letter can be selected at a time.|$|E

25|$|Finally, a {{few other}} toys and gimmicks are added, such as toy villains and other small themed characters. Once {{everything}} is tested {{and seems to be}} running alright, the playfield is set on top of the lower box. The lower box on computerized games is essentially empty. On older electromechanical games, the entire floor of the lower box was used to mount custom relays and special scoring switches, making older games much heavier. To protect the top of the playfield, a tempered glass window is installed, secured by a <b>metal</b> <b>bar</b> that is locked into place. The expensive, unique, painted vertical backglass is fragile. The backglass covers the custom microprocessor boards on newer games, or electromechanical scoring wheels on older games. On older games, a broken backglass might be impossible to replace, ruining the game's appeal.|$|E
500|$|Following the accident, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) {{issued an}} Airworthiness Directive {{ordering}} all DC-6 and DC-6B aircraft to be {{fitted with a}} sequence gate latch, known as a Martin bar. The device is a <b>metal</b> <b>bar</b> which a crew would manually swing {{in front of the}} thrust levers over the idle line, physically preventing the thrust levers from being retarded into the reverse position. According to the CAB report, a United Airlines engineer told investigators the Martin bar should make propeller reversal [...] "a more reliable and safer device ... with its numerous switches, relays, and automatic operation." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1960, the International Conference on Weights and Measures {{defined the}} meter as 1,650,763.73 {{wavelengths}} of light emitted by the krypton-86 isotope. This agreement replaced the 1889 international prototype meter located in Paris, {{which was a}} <b>metal</b> <b>bar</b> made of a platinum-iridium alloy (one {{of a series of}} standard meter bars, originally constructed to be one ten-millionth of a quadrant of the Earth's polar circumference). This also obsoleted the 1927 definition of the ångström based on the red cadmium spectral line, replacing it with 1Å = 1010m. [...] The krypton-86 definition lasted until the October 1983 conference, which redefined the meter as the distance that light travels in a vacuum during 1/299,792,458s.|$|E

500|$|Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey uses KUKA robocoaster technology, {{which allows}} the seats to pivot while being held above the track by a robotic arm. However, the ride is not a roller coaster but a scenic dark ride. The {{experience}} includes a flight around Hogwarts castle, an encounter with the Whomping Willow and a horde of Dementors, and a Quidditch match. The ride drops, spins around, twists and turns, but does not turn upside down, though passengers sometimes lie flat on their backs. Over-the-shoulder bars are used to secure guests in their seats, and a single parabolic <b>metal</b> <b>bar</b> [...] {{is used as a}} hand grip. At the conclusion of the ride, guests exit into Filch's Emporium of Confiscated Goods gift shop.|$|E
500|$|When a {{removable}} denture is worn, retainers {{to hold the}} denture in place can be either custom made or [...] "off-the-shelf" [...] (stock) abutments. When custom retainers are used, four or more implant fixtures are placed and an impression of the implants is taken and a dental lab creates a custom <b>metal</b> <b>bar</b> with attachments to hold the denture in place. Significant retention can be created with multiple attachments {{and the use of}} semi-precision attachments (such as a small diameter pin that pushes through the denture and into the bar) which allows for little or no movement in the denture, but it remains removable. [...] However, the same four implants angled in such a way to distribute occlusal forces may be able to safely hold a fixed denture in place with comparable costs and number of procedures giving the denture wearer a fixed solution.|$|E
500|$|Historical and anecdotal {{evidence}} {{strongly suggest that}} the once-abundant estuary stingray has declined substantially across its range. Although it is not commercially utilized, it faces {{a number of other}} threats. This species is captured incidentally by commercial bottom trawl and gillnet fisheries; bycatch mortality is exacerbated by the practice of [...] "spiking", in which the ray's cranium is pierced with a <b>metal</b> <b>bar</b> or sharpened stick so as to move it. It is also readily caught, and often killed, by recreational anglers. Surveys in Moreton Bay have found fishing-related effects, such as embedded hooks and mutilated tails, in over 10% of the population. Habitat degradation is another major threat to the estuary stingray, especially given its habitat specificity. Its range encompasses some of the most urbanized areas in Australia, where there is extensive land reclamation, water pollution, and construction of flood mitigation barriers on rivers. Finally, this ray's reputation for damaging shellfish has led to persecution by commercial shellfish farmers.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{model of}} the transmission line was probably described by Georg Ohm (1827) who established that resistance in a wire is proportional to its length.*John C. Shedd, Mayo D. Hershey, [...] "The history of Ohm's law", The Popular Science Monthly, pp.599-614, December 1913 ISSN 0161-7370. The Ohm model thus included only resistance. Latimer Clark noted that signals were delayed and elongated along a cable, an undesirable form of distortion now called dispersion but then called retardation, and Michael Faraday (1853) established that {{this was due to}} the capacitance present in the transmission line. Lord Kelvin (1854) found the correct mathematical description needed in his work on early transatlantic cables; he arrived at an equation identical to the conduction of a heat pulse along a <b>metal</b> <b>bar.</b> This model incorporates only resistance and capacitance, but that is all that was needed in undersea cables dominated by capacitance effects. Kelvin's model predicts a limit on the telegraph signalling speed of a cable but Kelvin still did not use the concept of bandwidth, the limit was entirely explained in terms of the dispersion of the telegraph symbols. The mathematical {{model of the}} transmission line reached its fullest development with Oliver Heaviside. Heaviside (1881) introduced series inductance and shunt conductance into the model making four distributed elements in all. This model is now known as the telegrapher's equation and the distributed elements are called the primary line constants.Heaviside, O, Electrical Papers, vol 1, pp.139-140, Boston, 1925 ...|$|E
