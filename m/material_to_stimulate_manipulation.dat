25|$|While most antivirals treat viral infection, {{vaccines}} are {{a preemptive}} {{first line of}} defense against pathogens. Vaccination involves the introduction (i.e. via injection) of a small amount of typically inactivated or attenuated antigenic <b>material</b> <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> an individual’s immune system. The immune system responds by developing white blood cells to specifically combat the introduced pathogen, resulting in adaptive immunity. Vaccination in a population results in herd immunity and greatly improved population health, with significant reductions in viral infection and disease.|$|R

50|$|PCBs are {{toxic to}} {{bacterial}} communities above 1000 mg/kg. However, if the concentration {{is too low}} (lower than 50 mg/kg), the degradation slows down significantly, for {{there is not enough}} <b>material</b> <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> the expression of required genes and support the growth of competent microorganisms. PCBs includes various different compounds with slightly different structures. Those slight differences make big differences in metabolic rate. Generally speaking, the more chlorines in a PCB molecule, the harder for it to be degraded. In particular,  microorganisms cannot degrade di- and tetra-ortho substituted well. It is possible that those structures prevent enzymes from accessing reaction sites.|$|R
