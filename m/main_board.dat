5|$|The {{process of}} {{appointing}} a new Scotland manager is {{undertaken by the}} main SFA board. After a review was conducted by former First Minister of Scotland Henry McLeish, the SFA board structure was streamlined considerably in 2011. Professional game and non-professional game boards govern their respective areas of football, while the <b>main</b> <b>board</b> has a strategic focus. There are seven members on the <b>main</b> <b>board,</b> consisting of four SFA office bearers, one representative each from the professional game and non-professional game boards and one independent member. As of September 2013, these positions are occupied by Stewart Regan (chief executive), Campbell Ogilvie (president), Alan MacRae (first vice-president), Rod Petrie (second vice-president), Peter Lawwell (professional game) and Barrie Jackson (independent). The non-professional game position is presently vacant.|$|E
5|$|Smallpeice {{served as}} a {{director}} of Martins Bank from 1965 to 1969 alongside Sir John Brocklebank, his predecessor as Cunard chairman, remaining with Martins until 1969 when the bank was incorporated into Barclays Bank. He served on the London local board of Martins Bank prior to his appointment on the <b>main</b> <b>board,</b> serving from to 1964 to 1965. Smallpeice would join the London local board of Barclays Bank after their takeover of Martins Bank, a position he held until 1973.|$|E
5|$|As {{both the}} other {{alternatives}} were discarded, consensus gradually grew for the Flåm alternative, and the Railway Committee for Nordre Bergenhus County recommended this proposal. New plans from NSB criticized {{the mix of}} rack and adhesion railway, and instead proposed a conventional adhesion line all the way. Engineer Ferdinand Bjerke traveled to Continental Europe to study several combined railways. He published a preliminary report in 1911, which recommended an adhesion railway, although he also felt {{the need for a}} detailed study of a rack railway. His final report was finished in 1913, and although it recommended adhesion, it pointed out that the line's capacity would be smaller than predicted and that costs would be three times as high—NOK5.5 million. The plans were approved by the Ministry of Labour and NSB's <b>main</b> <b>board</b> in 1915.|$|E

5|$|Banks used {{a number}} of {{keyboards}} during Genesis' career, continually trying out new models, though he used the piano regularly throughout the group's lifetime. In the 1970s, he frequently used the Hammond organ, Hohner Pianet, Mellotron, RMI Electronic Piano and ARP Pro Soloist. In the 1980s, he used the Sequential Circuits Prophet 5 and Prophet 10, the ARP Quadra and various Korg synthesizers. For the Turn It On Again tour in 2007, his <b>main</b> <b>board</b> was a Korg Oasys. As both a guitarist and bassist, Rutherford regularly swapped between the two roles, and his trademark instrument with Genesis, particularly through the 1970s, was a double neck guitar. In the 1980s and beyond, he favoured the Eric Clapton Stratocaster.|$|E
25|$|Apple {{announced}} a battery replacement program on November 14, 2003, {{a week before}} a high publicity stunt and website by the Neistat Brothers. The initial cost was US$99, and it was lowered to US$59 in 2005. One week later, Apple offered an extended iPod warranty for US$59. For the iPod Nano, soldering tools are needed because the battery is soldered onto the <b>main</b> <b>board.</b> Fifth generation iPods have their battery attached to the backplate with adhesive.|$|E

The {{remaining}} 28% {{was shared}} among the Clan Line (8%), Loel Guinness (10%) and Whitehall Securities (10%). This ownership structure made the Cayzer family the dominant shareholders.

25|$|Developing BUA {{primarily}} as a scheduled airline {{was one of the}} first major policy decisions the BUA group's <b>main</b> <b>board</b> took in the early 1960s. The Civil Aviation (Licensing) Act of 1960, which abolished the statutory monopoly British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and British European Airways (BEA) had enjoyed on principal domestic and international scheduled routes since the beginning of the post-war era and — theoretically — gave independent airlines equal opportunities to develop scheduled routes in their own right, formed the basis of this decision.|$|E

The Ballroom can be subdivided into four equal sections for smaller groups. There are also several breakout rooms with various layouts. There are five boardrooms {{located on the}} fifth floor of the Palm Wing. The <b>main</b> <b>board</b> room is 940 square feet (87 m2), the second board room is 425 square feet (39.5 m2), and the other three board rooms are 364 square feet (33.8 m2).|$|E
25|$|The {{union has}} 97 congregations. Membership {{is tied to}} the {{individual}} congregations rather than to the union. Based on a form of weak congregationalism, these are autonomous organizations which elect their own leadership. The union therefore acts as a coordinating organization. The congregations are organized into five regional districts, each with their own board. The union has an annual meeting every year with delegates from each congregation. This body holds the supreme authorities within the union. It appoints the <b>main</b> <b>board,</b> other committees and various issues regarding economy, institutions and plans.|$|E

500|$|A printed inverted-F antenna can be {{implemented}} in the classic inverted-F shape, usually {{to one side of}} the circuit board where the ground plane has been removed from underneath the antenna. [...] However, another approach is a modified patch antenna, the shorted patch antenna. [...] In this approach, one edge of the patch, or some intermediate point, is grounded with grounding pins or vias through to the ground plane. [...] This works on the same principle as an inverted-F; viewed sideways, the F shape can be seen, it is just that the antenna element is very wide in the horizontal plane. [...] The shorted patch antenna has a wider bandwidth than the thin line type due to the greater radiation area. [...] Like the thin line type, the shorted patch antenna can be printed on the same printed circuit board as the rest of the circuitry. [...] However, they are commonly printed on to their own board, or on to a dielectric fixed to the <b>main</b> <b>board.</b> [...] This is done so that the antenna, can be suspended and effectively be in air dielectric, is a greater distance from the ground plane than it would otherwise be, or the dielectric used is a more suitable material for RF performance.|$|E
