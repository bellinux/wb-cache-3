Huntsman said the critics were overreacting to Trump's decision to accept the phone call, and that Trump's nontraditional style <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> opportunity for a shift in Asia relations in future talks with China.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Hooper {{directed}} two {{episodes of}} Granada Television's comedy-drama television series Cold Feet, which marked his move to bigger-budget productions. There was initially concern at Granada that Hooper <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> unsuitable {{director for the}} series given his background in drama.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavators}} {{found an}} iron object under the skeleton's vertebrae and speculated it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> arrowhead {{that had been}} embedded in its back. An X-ray analysis showed it was a nail, probably of Romano-British date, that by chance had been in the ground immediately under the grave or was in soil disturbed when it was dug and {{had nothing to do with}} the body.|$|E

5|$|The non-canonical Gospel of Thomas <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> {{independent}} {{witness to}} many of Jesus' parables and aphorisms. For example, Thomas confirms that Jesus blessed the poor and that this saying circulated independently before being combined with similar sayings in the Q source. Other select non-canonical Christian texts may also have value for historical Jesus research.|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids exhibit strong {{positive}} phototactic behaviour (attraction to light) {{and will}} move readily {{within a certain}} distance of a light source. Studies have proposed that this <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> involuntary stimulus behaviour, as the squids immediately stop all other movements once a light source is switched on. The colour of the light does not matter, {{but it has been}} shown that they react more strongly to underwater lights between the intensities of 1.5 to 2.5lx, with peak ranges of 2.5 to 10.0lx.|$|E
5|$|Discovered in 1995, the Pyxis {{globular}} cluster is a 13.3 ± 1.3 billion year-old {{globular cluster}} situated around 130,000 light-years distant from Earth and around 133,000 light-years {{distant from the}} centre of the Milky Way—a region not previously thought to contain globular clusters. Located in the galactic halo, it was noted to lie on the same plane as the Large Magellanic Cloud and the possibility has been raised that it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> escaped object from that galaxy.|$|E

5|$|Like the board, which <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> ad hoc affair, {{the actual}} exam {{questions}} were not standardized and their content depended mostly on individual captains. In seamanship, the candidate {{was expected to}} be able to splice ropes, reef a sail, work a ship in sailing and shift his tides. In navigation, he {{was expected to be}} able to keep a reckoning of the ship's way by plane sailing, to use Mercator projection maps and observation of the sun and stars to determine the course and position of the ship, and to understand the variation of the compass. He was also expected to be qualified to do the duty of an able seaman and midshipman.|$|E
5|$|The {{kings of}} the first kingdom were buried outside the city; the last ten kings (ending with Irkab-Damu) were buried in Darib, while older kings were buried in a royal {{mausoleum}} located in Binas and only one royal tomb dating to the first kingdom was discovered in Ebla (Hypogeum G4). This first kingdom tomb was probably built {{during the reign of}} the last king and <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> indication of Eblaite adoption of Mesopotamian traditions to bury the kings beneath their royal palaces.|$|E
5|$|The problem {{posed by}} the ratio is that the {{multiple}} specimens studied, died in the same place, but probably not in a sudden mass-death and so do not represent a single herd or contemporary population. The results may have been distorted by a greater chance for robust animals of getting fossilised or discovered. In an earlier study by Galton in 1982, {{it was suggested that}} individual difference in the sacral rib count of both Kentrosaurus and Dacentrurus <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> indication of dimorphism: females would have had an extra pair of sacral ribs, having also the first sacral vertebra connected to the ilium, in addition to the subsequent four sacrals.|$|E

5|$|Ultra-stripped supernovae {{occur when}} the {{exploding}} star has been stripped (almost) {{all the way to}} the metal core, via mass transfer in a close binary. As a result, very little material is ejected from the exploding star (~0.1 MSun). In the most extreme cases, ultra-stripped supernovae can occur in naked metal cores, barely above the Chandrasekhar mass limit. SN 2005ek <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> observational example of an ultra-stripped supernova, giving rise to a relatively dim and fast decaying light curve. The nature of ultra-stripped supernovae can be both iron core-collapse and electron capture supernovae, depending on the mass of the collapsing core.|$|E
5|$|NASA astronauts train {{underwater}} {{to simulate}} the weightlessness and occasionally need to fly afterwards at cabin altitudes not exceeding 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). Training dives use 46% Nitrox and can exceed six hours at a maximum depth of 40ffw (12mfw) for a maximum equivalent air depth (EAD) of 24fsw (7 msw). NASA guidelines for EADs of 20–50fsw (6–15msw) with maximum dive durations of 100–400 minutes allow either air or oxygen to be breathed in the preflight surface intervals. Oxygen breathing during surface intervals reduces the time to fly {{by a factor of}} seven to nine times compared with air. A study by another military organization, the Special Operations Command also indicated that preflight oxygen <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> effective means for reducing DCS risk.|$|E
5|$|On the Union side, Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, Grant's {{superior}} {{as commander}} of the Department of the Missouri, was also apprehensive. Halleck had authorized Grant to capture Fort Henry, but now he felt that continuing to Fort Donelson was risky. Despite Grant's success to date, Halleck had little confidence in him, considering Grant to be reckless. Halleck attempted to convince his own rival, Don Carlos Buell, to take command of the campaign to get his additional forces engaged. Despite Johnston's high regard for Buell, the Union general was as passive as Grant was aggressive. Grant never suspected his superiors were considering relieving him, but he was well aware that any delay or reversal <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> opportunity for Halleck to lose his nerve and cancel the operation.|$|E

In 1999, Rod East of the IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group estimated the springbok population in South Africa at more than 670,000, noting that it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> underestimate. However, estimates for Namibia, Angola, Botswana, Transvaal, Karoo, and the Free State (which gave a total population estimate of nearly 2,000,000 – 2,500,000 animals in southern Africa), were in complete disagreement with East's estimate. Springbok are under active management in several private lands. Small populations have been introduced into private lands and provincial areas of KwaZulu-Natal.|$|E
