40|$|The cases studied show {{a lively}} bamboo sector that is expanding, {{contributing}} to employment {{and economic development}} in rural areas of China. County variations seem to indicate alternative land use options and different degrees of industrial development among them. New demands, notably for bamboo shoots are widening the range of species being planted, signaling a trend towards greater diversification, although most bamboo remains the dominant species. A new emerging issue is how to improve bamboo management while trying to satisfy development and environmental objectives. While bamboo intensification is showing signs of environmental impact, many naturally occurring species of bamboo remain still under-utilized if not blatantly ignored, being sometimes considered as a weed. The first phase of land reform seems to have reached a ceiling. There is a wide consensus that the reforms undertaken have triggered a major expansion of the bamboo sector. However, a new momentum in the reform process is needed. Extending the length of contracts, improving the conditions and guarantees for inheritability of rights, allowing for some flexibility in the allocation of land and {{a new approach to}} subleasing, as well as incentives to improve management of state and collective farms are currently being discussed and applied in an experimental way.

40|$|Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is {{the second}} most {{important}} food crop after rice, the staple in Sierra Leone; it is also the most important root and tuber crop. It is followed by sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.), yam (Dioscorea spp.), which forms part of the traditional farming system and has only recently been included in the research agenda of NARC/SLARI and potato (Solanum tuberosum L) aka “Irish” potato in Sierra Leone, an introduced crop from neighbouring Republic of Guinea. Genetic improvement of the above crops is mainly through introduction of exotic germplasm from the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) at Ibadan, Nigeria; and screening, selection and advancement of promising lines in a participatory manner with farmers and other stakeholders in the crop development process. Breeding objectives of the above crops are aimed at addressing the devastating problem of pests and diseases prevalent in Sierra Leone, cassava mosaic disease (CMD), cassava bacterial blight (CBB), green mite, mealy bug and grasshoppers; sweet potato virus x and scab, and late blight of potato), yield and quality for the various desirable traits of eating, processing and potential industrial uses. Several genotypes of cassava have been released in the recent past (SLICASS 1 - 6) with yield range of 25 - 35 mt/ha whilst new and more nutrient-rich genotypes including yellow rooted ones with yield range of 40 - 50 mt/ha are in the pipeline for release. The yield ranges of sweet potato, yam and potato are 6 - 10 mt/ha, 10 - 27 mt/ha and 2 - 4 mt/ha, respectively. Four potato varieties (SLIPOT 1 - 4) were recently released to the farming population of Sierra Leone. The current status of cassava, sweet potato (including recent and more nutritious, âcarotene genotypes), yam and potato breeding activities at NARC/SLARI, Sierra Leone is summarized and presented. Yam and potato improvement is new but significant strides have already been made in identifying promising lines of the former with the desirable traits or qualities that are acceptable to both farmers and consumers alike in the country. Production of cassava has increased more than three folds {{since the end of the}} civil war in 2002, during which period it served as the most easily cultivated, accessible and affordable food crop, along with sweet potato to the majority of the then internally displaced population (IDP). Recent trends in production of these two crops are also given. Cassava transformation into many useful food products, especially gari, fufu and high quality cassava flour (HQCF) is receiving tremendous boost in many parts of the country by both regional and national projects (CFC/IITA/SLARI) Cassava Value Addition, USAID/IITA-Sierra Leone Unleashing the Power of Cassava in Africa (UpoCA), AfDB/FARA/CORAF/WECARD/ SLARI Promotion of Science and Technology for Agricultural Development (PSTAD) in Africa Project (Dissemination of New Agricultural Technologies in Africa (DONATA) and Regional Agricultural Information Learning Systems (RAILS), Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and the private sector. Strides made in that direction are also summarized and presented. On a lesser scale, processing of sweet potato into more durable and useful by-products such as flour is beginning to receive the necessary attention by scientists at NARC/SLARI, and Njala University (NU), Sierra Leone and the Federal University of Agriculture at Abeokuta (UNAAB) and Association of African Universities (AAU) Regional Food Developers Initiative (FDI) Project, Nigeria.

40|$|Most Rwandan {{coffee is}} {{currently}} grown and processed {{the same way}} it was a decade ago. Consequently, Rwanda’s coffee production and marketing system {{has not been able to}} keep up with changes in the global market for high quality coffee. Given world <b>market</b> <b>gluts</b> of relatively poor quality coffee, Rwanda is now exporting a product that fetches low prices. Despite the challenges in coffee marketing and production, coffee remains one of Rwanda’s most important official sources of foreign exchange and the drop in production is of major concern to both the public and private sectors. In an effort to assist decision makers in the coffee sector better understand factors affecting farmers’ production decisions and their attitudes about coffee, the FSRP fielded a nationally representative survey in 2002. The survey results show that the sector appears to be at a turning point—significant numbers of farmers have moved away from coffee with more seemingly on the cusp of removing more trees, or “decaffeinating” their fields. While the overall picture presented in this report is one of decline, there are also some encouraging changes. Liberalization of coffee policies in the mid- 1990 s seems to have increased yields by taking the poorest fields out of production. Growing farmer interest in intercropping coffee with food crops suggests that there may be a means of stretching Rwanda’s most limiting resource—land area— thereby enabling farmers to achieve a better combination of food and cash crops. Also, the fact that the coffee sector survives at all in the face of numerous adversities is a weighty testament to its potential. food security, food policy, Rwanda, coffee, Crop Production/Industries, Q 18,...|$|R

5000|$|The {{first version}} of market-clearing theory assumes that the price {{adjustment}} process occurs instantaneously. If, for example, a community is subject to an earthquake which destroys all of the houses and apartments, its members will have a sudden increased demand for new housing. Immediately after the disaster, the market for housing in the community will be temporarily out of equilibrium, suffering from an excess demand for houses and apartments (shortage). But if markets are free to operate (i.e., if prices are free to change), and given enough time, prices will increase causing (1) construction companies to build new houses {{in the short run}} and (2) new companies to enter the house and apartment-construction market in the longer run. This increase in production brings supply into balance with the new demand. The adjustment mechanism has cleared the shortage from the market and established a new equilibrium. A similar mechanism is believed to operate when there is a <b>market</b> surplus (<b>glut),</b> where prices fall until all the excess supply is sold off. An example of excess supply is Christmas decorations that are still in stores several days after Christmas; the stores that still have boxes of decorations view these products as [...] "excess supply", so the prices are discounted until shoppers buy all the decorations (to keep them until next Christmas).|$|R

50|$|In most interpretations, {{classical}} economists such as Adam Smith {{maintained that}} the free market would tend towards economic equilibrium through the price mechanism. That is, any excess supply (<b>market</b> surplus or <b>glut)</b> would lead to price cuts, which decrease the quantity supplied (by reducing the incentive to produce and sell the product) and increase the quantity demanded (by offering consumers bargains), automatically abolishing the glut. Similarly, in an unfettered market, any excess demand (or shortage) would lead to price increases, reducing the quantity demanded (as customers are priced out of the market) and increasing in the quantity supplied (as the incentive to produce and sell a product rises). As before, the disequilibrium (here, the shortage) disappears.

50|$|This {{provides}} {{an explanation for}} recessionary spirals and economic depressions. Without sufficient demand for the products of labor, the availability of jobs will be low; without enough jobs, working people will receive inadequate income, implying insufficient demand for products.

(Of course, most employees get paid after working, after some of the product is sold.) Further, unlike the Say's law story above, there are interactions between different <b>markets</b> (and their <b>gluts</b> and shortages) that go beyond the simple price mechanism, to limit the quantity of jobs supplied and the quantity of products demanded.|$|R

The paper deals with each theme and analyses its contents and place in Sismondi's work. The study of the relation between time and economie evolution allows the introduction of uncertainty in the perfect foresight classical scheme. As far as the notion of economic agent is concerned, Sismondi specified the classical conception of social classes in capitalism.
