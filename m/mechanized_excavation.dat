40|$|<b>Mechanized</b> <b>excavation</b> in {{soft rock}} has been {{extensively}} studied {{in the field of}} mining when machines such as roadheaders are used. During this time, Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs) have been the ideal machines for working in hard rock and their application has a good empirical / theoretical basis, especially regarding the excavation efficiency. Both techniques enjoy having such broad empirical support that it lets us establish a good number of benchmarks both to guide the design of the cutting heads and to assess the efficiency of equipment in a given project.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} predictions in a <b>mechanized</b> <b>excavation</b> project is the performance of the excavation Rostami et al., (1994), Bilgin & Balci, (2005). To obtain an efficient ground excavation in <b>mechanized</b> <b>excavation</b> it is important to achieve an efficient interact between cutting tools and ground. This is clearly fundamental to be able to gauge and evaluate this efficiency and the best paramenter to do it with is specific energy Gertsch et al., (2007), Frenzel et al., (2008). But during the excavation process the cutting tools are themselves worn Beste & Jacobson, (2008), Thuro et al., (2006) and the larger the tool wear, the lower the cutting efficiency. It is this wearing effect of the excavation process that abrasivity measures aim to quantify, Johnson & Fowel, (1986), Nilsen et al., (2006). A good parameter to measure the efficient interaction between soil/rock and tool should be one that would let us know from an integral point of view how appropriate the machine design and its tools are for the project geology. Specific Energy (SE) is proposed as this parameter. Postprint (published version...|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} {{methods have}} been widely applied to model the <b>mechanized</b> tunnel <b>excavation</b> {{for the purpose of}} prediction of the system behavior. This research mainly focuses on the influencing factors which may affect the simulation results of tunneling in-duced ground movements. Plaxis 3 D (FEM) and FLAC 3 D (FDM) are utilized to model the mechanized tunneling process by taking into account the most significant components, namely sequential excavation, face support, grouting pressure and lining installation. The differences in simulation approach between these two programs are demonstrated and the corresponding influences on the model responses are investigated as well. The soil behavior is described by using elasto-plastic Hardening Soil (HS) model which is available in both programs. It is firstly applied to small scale oedometer and triaxial element tests to validate the constitutive model in both programs. This research discusses the discrepancies in the model output due to complex soil structure interactions and intricate mechanized tunneling components subjected to these different simulation techniques. The results show that there is a good agreement between the ground movements predicted by these two programs in case of stiff soil scenario...|$|R

40|$|When {{a project}} {{includes}} two parallel tunnels, cross passages linking both tunnels are normally constructed for safety reasons during tunnel exercise. Design {{and construction of}} the cross passages is a challenging issue in tunnelling design.

40|$|During the {{construction}} of twin tunnels excavated {{in close proximity to}} each other, the prediction of the influence of a new tunnel construction on an already existing one {{plays an important role in}} the design and construction of the tunnels.

40|$|For {{long and}} deep tunnels as {{currently}} under construction through the Alps, mechanised excavation by using Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs) may contribute significantly to savings in construction times and costs. Questions are however posed due to the severe ground conditions which in cases are anticipated or encountered along the main tunnel alignment. One of these geological hazards is the stress-induced brittle failure of hard rocks, leading to spalling (formation of rock slabs) and/or rockbursting (violent ejection of rock fragments). This thesis initially deals with brittle failure, both in laboratory tests (uniaxial and/or triaxial) and in tunnelling, with {{a special interest in}} TBM excavation experience. In fact, this failure mode can create a significant hazard for workers immediately behind the shield, as well as gripper problems and machine operation delays. Rock bursting can even lead to TBM jamming. The description of the many models proposed in the current literature for predicting brittle failure around underground openings is given. The rock mass can be considered a continuum, a discontinuum or a hybrid continuum/discontinuum. The most practical and widely used approach is the so-called phenomenological/empirical approach (continuum assumption). Then, the interest is moved to the current state-of-the-art in numerical modelling of the TBM excavation process. It is noted that only axisymmetric or fully threedimensional (3 D) models are capable to study in detail the complex interaction between the rock mass, the tunnel machine and its system components, and the tunnel support. The most advanced and accurate models are the 3 D models. It is seen however that very few fully 3 D models for mechanised deep tunnel excavation have been developed so far and no one refers to spalling conditions. The main scope of this thesis is therefore to present a novel and completely 3 D FEM simulator for <b>mechanized</b> tunnel <b>excavation</b> of deep tunnels in brittle conditions. The main machine and support components are taken into account. The TBM of reference is the technologically advanced Double Shield TBM. The model is conceived in particular for modelling the spalling behaviour of hard rock masses. An elasto-brittle-plastic constitutive law based on the criterion developed by Diederichs has been proposed and successfully validated through the comparison with field data and the results of other codes and criteria. The considered case study is related to the Brenner Base Tunnel excavation on the Italian side, in hard brittle granitic rocks. Two simulations have been carried out. The first one is a design analysis with reference to the spalling hazard along the main tunnel. The second one reproduces an instability problem which occurred during the excavation of the Aicha exploratory tunnel at chainage 6 + 151, due to the presence of a thin granite diaphragm between a subvertical fault and the tunnel wall. The results obtained show that the 3 D model is highly effective in reproducing both the rock mass response (in terms of extent, shape and depth of the failure zones) and its interaction with the TBM system components (confinement effects producing a reduction of the failure zones...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in transportation {{in large cities}} makes it necessary to construct of twin tunnels at shallow depths. Thus, the prediction {{of the influence of}} a new tunnel construction on an already existing one {{plays a key role in}} the optimal design and construction of close parallel shield tunnels in order to avoid any damage to the existing tunnel during and after excavation of the new tunnel. Most of the reported cases in the literature on parallel <b>mechanized</b> <b>excavation</b> of twin tunnels have focused on the effects of the ground condition, tunnel size, tunnel depth, surface loads, and relative position between the two tunnels on tunnel behaviour. The numerical investigation performed in this study, using the FLAC 3 D finite difference element programme, has made it possible to include the influence of the construction process between the two tunnels. The structural forces induced in both tunnels and the development of the displacement field in the surrounding ground have been highlighted. The results of the numerical analysis have indicated a great impact of a new tunnel construction on an existing tunnel. The influence of the lagged distance between the two tunnels faces has also been highlighted. Generally, the simultaneous excavation of twin tunnels causes smaller structural forces and lining displacements than those induced in the case of twin tunnels excavated at a large lagged distance. However, the simultaneous excavation of twin tunnels could result in a higher settlement above the two tunnel...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of underground infrastructures for both transport purposes (roads, railways, and metro) to face and solve {{the need of}} urban mobility but also for mountain, sea straits or rivers crossing and for water transportation (clean or sewage water) has today a relevant role in modern society. In this context, it assumes a particular importance the {{construction of}} tunnel linings in a shorter time and in safe conditions to remain within the project budget; full face mechanized tunnels are consequently under considerably improving {{all over the world}} with the adoption of bigger and more powerful machines; in this case, the linings are usually made of precast segments. Parallel to the improvement of <b>mechanized</b> methods of <b>excavation,</b> it is evident the need to also develop the behavior of these tunnel elements in terms of bearing capacity, crack control and water-tightness. To this aim, in the last two decades, Fiber Reinforced Concrete (FRC) was progressively adopted in several tunnel projects. The benefits related to the inclusion of fiber reinforcement in the cementitious composites are several but, the most important, is the noticeable increase of the post-cracking tensile residual properties. Moreover, the fiber reinforcement enables a considerable boost of the tunnel elements production process. The enhancement of the general structural behavior together with the improvement of the industrialization process of tunnel segments are probably the two main key-factors of the continuously growing use of FRC in precast tunnel linings. Within this framework, the aim of this report is to provide advances in the design of FRC tunnel lining in accordance with the objectives of the International Tunnelling Association (ITA) prescribed in Section II of the Statutes of the ITA (ITA, 1976). In fact, even if general standards or recommendations concerning the design of FRC elements are already available, the needed to shed some new light on the specific requirements and loading conditions of tunnel elements is considerable.

After several discussions and meetings the current version was completed and presented herein...|$|R
