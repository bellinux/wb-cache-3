40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{different}} types of trade liberalization { multilateral versus regional { may lead to different R&D and productivity levels of firms. Trade agreements between countries are modelled with a network: nodes represent countries and {{a link between the}} nodes indicates the existence of a trade agreement. In this framework, the <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreement</b> is represented by the complete network while the overlap of regional trade agreements is represented by the hub-and-spoke trade system. Trade liberalization, which increases the network of trade agreements, reinforces the incentives for firms to invest in R&D through the creation of new markets (scale effect) but it may also dampen these incentives through the emergence of new competitors (competition effect). The joint action of these two effects within the multilateral and the regional trade systems gives rise to the result that, for the same number of direct trade partners, the R&D effort of a country in the multilateral agreement is lower than the R&D effort of a hub but higher than the R&D effort of a spoke. This suggests that a "core" country within the regional trade system has higher R&D and productivity level than a country with the same number of trade agreements within the multilateral system whereas the opposite is true for a "periphery" country. Additionally, the paper finds that while multilateral trade liberalization boosts productivity of all countries, regional trade liberalization increases productivity of core economies but may decrease productivity of periphery economies if the level of competition in the new trade partner countries of the periphery economy is "too high". Furthermore, the aggregate level of R&D activities within the <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreement</b> exceeds that in the star { the simplest representative of the hub-and-spoke trade system...|$|E

When a PTA that includes the developing country is feasible, but a <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreement</b> is infeasible due to prior to technology adoption in the developing country, a free trade area (FTA) accelerates technology adoption and the realization of multilateral free trade; however a customs union (CU) delays these processes.

Even if increased realization of free trade via an FTA improves world welfare, a developed country may prefer liberalization via a CU...|$|E

40|$|This {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the effects of {{exchange}} rate risk in the value of bilateral and multilateral trade agreements. In order to value a bilateral trade agreement we initially consider a firm that must sell al its output in the local market. Then, we assume that the country in which the firm is located joins a bilateral trade agreement allowing the firm to redirect its output to another market whenever the level of exchange rates makes this optimal. The value of the bilateral trade agreement for the firm is then computed as the difference in firm value under both scenarios. Similarly, we value a <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreement</b> by computing the value of a firm that has the option to redirect its output to any among N countries. Our results indicate that volatility of exchange rates may be valuable and thus their stabilization may harm some firms. In particular it provides support to those who oppose eliminating all volatility by means of defining a single currency within these trade aFree trade agreements. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{high hopes}} that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) would open up trade across the Pacific were dashed by the {{decision}} of the new US Government under President Trump to withdraw from the agreement in January 2017. Despite being controversial, the TPP had been recognized as an agreement that substantially updated and extended international trade rules responding to new technological developments and economic realities. It was thus lauded by some as the first true 21 st century trade agreement. The United States' withdrawal from TPP gives the agreement an uncertain future. Yet, we argue in this paper that some achievements of the TPP might not be lost. The TPP offers important lessons for other ambitious regional trade deals both in terms of process and content. Furthermore, several chapters of the TPP can become blueprints for ongoing and upcoming negotiations at the multilateral level. A one-to-one transposition of TPP provisions into the <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreement</b> is unlikely, yet certain provisions could serve as valuable aspiration for future multilateral trade talks...|$|E

40|$|Several {{empirical}} studies have documented that exporters have positive performance characteristics relative to firms only servicing the domestic market. Whether {{these findings imply}} that policies that expand export opportunities {{have a positive impact}} on firm performance depends on whether exporting causes better performance or better firms self select into the export market. In this paper I investigate the impact of a <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreement</b> (MERCOSUR) on entry in the export market and investment in technology within the framework of a simple model that introduces technology choice in Melitz (2003) model. In the model, a reduction in variable export costs increases exporting revenues, inducing more firms to enter the export market, and to adopt new technologies. The empirical identification of the effect of falling Brazilian tariffs on entry in the export market and technology upgrading by Argentinean firms is based in the change in Brazilian tariffs across 4 -digit-SIC industries. I find that the average reduction in export tariffs (0. 24) increases the probability of entry in the export market by 0. 10 and increases spending in technology by 0. 20 log points...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} for understanding and interpreting reciprocity and nondiscrimination, the two principles that are the pillars of the multilateral trading system as embodied in GATT and its successor, the WTO. We show that GATT’s principle of reciprocity serves to neutralize the world-price effects of a country’s trade policy decisions, and hence can deliver efficient trade-policy outcomes for its member governments provided that the externalities associated with trade intervention travel through world prices. We then establish that externalities indeed travel in this way {{if and only if}} tariffs also conform to the principle of non-discrimination (MFN). In this way, the principles of reciprocity and non-discrimination can work in concert to deliver efficient outcomes for the multilateral trading system. We also consider within our framework the implications of preferential agreements for the multilateral trading system. The introduction of free trade agreements complicates the way in which externalities are transmitted across countries, and in this environment the principle of reciprocity and deliver an efficient <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreement</b> in the presence of preferential agreements.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} mediators in WTO trade negotiations {{and the impact of}} individual mediation strategies on the outcome of these negotiations. It seeks to answer the question how mediators can help negotiators to overcome the bargaining problem and reach an agreement. The thesis first presumes that mediators who frequently apply more interventionist and inclusive tactics can increase the likelihood of a successful outcome of negotiations. Secondly, it presupposes that particular mediation tactics enable negotiators to save their face not only in front of their opponents, but more importantly also in front of domestic constituencies. Using the case of Geneva-based negotiations and the Bali Ministerial Conference, the thesis tracks individual mediation strategies which were employed by WTO chairs or the Director-General to determine their impact on the final adoption of the Bali package, representing the first <b>multilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreement</b> concluded {{under the auspices of the}} WTO. The analysis indicates that mediators who actively intervene in the bargaining process and assist negotiators in decreasing their audience costs may positively influence the chances of reaching an agreement.
