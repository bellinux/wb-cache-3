The objectives were to evaluate the potential use of the mixograph and farinograph to study DMF mixing and hydration properties and also to evaluate the use of the Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA), consistometer and penetrometer to study DMF properties. The effect of sample size, moisture level, mixing speed, temperature, particle size distribution and CMC level on the mixing characteristics of DMF were evaluated. Reformulated and commercial flours with and without CMC were also evaluated using a consistometer, penetrometer, RVA and also were subjectively evaluated for their machinability properties. Reduced moisture levels produced firmer masas which produced higher and wider curves. At increased moisture levels masa develops maximum consistency and stickiness faster. Excess water produced soft masas that exhibited decreased maximum consistency. Three stages were observed during mixing. The first stage involves hydration of the DMF causing the curve to go up. During the second stage, masa develops cohesiveness; the curve becomes wider and reaches maximum consistency. During the third stage, masa becomes sticky due to overmixing and the curve becomes narrower and lower. Mixing stages were developed at different times reflecting differences among DMF. Finer DMF required less mixing time to reach maximum consistency and to develop stickiness, whereas coarser flours produced firmer masas with increased maximum consistency. Masas from DMF containing 0. 5 % CMC exhibited the highest maximum consistency, while time to reach maximum consistency increased along with CMC level. Reduced penetrometer readings and shorter distances traveled in the consistometer, as well as increased viscosities in the RVA were significantly correlated to increased maximum consistency in the mixograph and farinograph. Subjective machinability determinations were also significantly correlated to mixograph and farinograph parameters. The mixograph and farinograph are simple techniques with acceptable repeatability to detect differences in mixing characteristics of DMF. Mixograph and farinograph as well as consistometer, penetrometer and RVA have potential for rapid evaluation of DMF properties and mixing performance in a quality control program...|$|R

Less than 3 % of US adults currently exceed the UL. Objective: The {{objective of this}} study was to determine if folic acid fortification of corn <b>masa</b> <b>flour</b> would increase the percentage of the US population who exceed the UL. Design: We used dietary intake data from NHANES 2001 &#x 2013; 2008 to estimate the percentage of adults and children who would exceed the UL if corn <b>masa</b> <b>flour</b> were fortified at 140 &#x 00 B 5;g of folic acid/ 100 g. Results: In 2001 &#x 2013; 2008, 2. 5 % of the US adult population (aged&#x 2265; 19 years) exceeded the UL, which could increase to 2. 6 % if fortification of corn <b>masa</b> <b>flour</b> occurred. With corn <b>masa</b> <b>flour</b> fortification, percentage point increases were small and not statistically significant for US adults exceeding the UL regardless of supplement use, sex, race/ethnicity, or age.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{fortification}} of tortilla chips with mechanically expelled soy flour as well as baking and frying processes on the properties of tortilla chips were evaluated. Sensory characteristics, texture, thickness, color, protein and oil content were evaluated. Texture was measured by objective and subjective tests. Sensory properties were evaluated using a nine point hedonic scale. Soybeans (food grade Hartz) were mechanically expelled to obtain partially defatted soy flour of 6. 7 % final oil content. Dry <b>masa</b> <b>flour</b> (DMF) was replaced with 0, 10, 20 and 30 % mechanically-expelled soy flour (MESF). The equilibrated tortilla was either fried in oil or baked in an air-impingement oven followed by convection oven drying. Overall, fried tortilla chips were harder and thicker than baked tortilla chips. Fried tortilla chips with 20 and 30 % soy flour substitution required less force to break. In fried tortilla chips, as MESF increased, force and work levels decreased, where 20 % MESF had the lowest force values. Thickness measurements of tortilla chips showed that as the thickness increased, the force and work also increased. Protein increased linearly in baked and fried tortilla chips where 30 % resulted in the highest protein level. In fried tortilla chips, MESF fortification increased oil levels linearly as well. Baked tortilla chips were lighter than fried tortilla chips. In a consumer sensory evaluation, fried tortilla chips were preferred more than the baked ones. In fried tortilla chips, 20 % had the highest sensory scores overall. Ten and 20 % MESF fortification in fried tortilla chips were the most acceptable of all. In all treatments, regardless of type of processing, panelists could not detect any ?beany? flavors {{in any of the}} samples.

An air impingement oven was used to evaluate the structures developed by different ingredients in baked corn chips and baked tortilla chips. Dry <b>masa</b> <b>flour</b> (DMF) was hydrated into masa, sheeted and cut. Masa triangles were baked in an air impingement oven to produce baked corn chips. Masa pieces were baked in a three-tier oven and then in an air impingement oven to produce baked tortilla chips. All chips were additionally dried in a forced air oven to reach the desired moisture content. Normal and waxy rice flours, sorghum flour, waxy sorghum flour, and waxy corn starch were evaluated. The starch and flours were gelatinized and tested. Chip texture was measured with a texture analyzer rupture test and a breakage susceptibility test. Selected baked corn chips were viewed through an environmental scanning electron microscope. A sensory panel for baked corn chips was conducted. Chips prepared with different ingredients through the two baking processes developed substantially different textures and structures. Gelatinization promoted puffing during baking through the development of a tight gel matrix that hindered the escape of steam by covering surface pores. Waxy ingredients helped develop a porous structure with numerous small air cells, probably due to their higher swelling capacity and to the slow reassociation of amylopectin chains. The extent of gelatinization prior to baking and the amylose/amylopectin ratio in each formulation significantly contributed to the structure and texture developed during and after baking. The air impingement baking procedure proved to be useful to evaluate the functionality of various additives that produced baked chips with significantly different structures and textures. This process is probably not directly scaleable for large production but it is a promising technique that points out what changes might be expected when different ingredients are added to masa in an effort to improve baked chip texture...|$|E

A commercial batch fryer was used. Heat and mass transfer during deep fat fryer of tortilla chips were analyzed in this study. The effects of oil degradation and frying oil temperature on the rate of moisture loss and oil absorption, and on the physical and thermal properties of tortilla chips during frying were investigated. Viscosity, effective thermal conductivity, and specific heat of the frying oil were also measured. Density, effective thermal conductivity, and specific heat of tortilla chips decreased during frying. After 60 seconds of frying the oil tended to concentrate around the puffed areas of the tortilla chips. The formation of the sponge-like network and the crust of the tortilla chip started around the first IO seconds of frying. Thermal and physical properties of the tortilla chips such as density, effective thermal conductivity, and texture should be analyzed before and after 10 seconds of flying. At this time most of the tortilla chip is fully gelatinized and the crust starts to develop at the surface. Results after IO seconds were in better agreement with the models investigated. An increase in oil deterioration and in the flying temperature seem to cause an increase in the water evaporation rate from the tortilla chip and an increase in the total amount of oil absorbed by the tortilla chip during frying. The convective heat transfer coefficient decreased with oil degradation and increased with temperature. Viscosity of the frying oil increased with oil degradation and decreased with temperature. Effects of oil degradation and oil temperature on tortilla chips' properties such as density, effective thermal conductivity, and specific heat were not clearly established, and need further investigation...|$|E

The effect of varying pH (4, 9 and 11) on fresh and dry mesa flour (pH 5, 7 and 10) tortillas was also evaluated. Nixtamal was washed at three different levels to obtain tortillas containing about 0, 50 and 100 % pericarp. Fumaric acid and lime solutions were used to produce acidic and alkaline tortillas respectively. Tortilla texture was evaluated at 0, 1 and 7 days of storage objectively using a texture analyzer and subjectively using a solvability test. As pericarp content and pH increased tortillas were softer, more flexible and extensible with a darker yellow color. Acidic tortillas were harder with a white color. Pericarp improved texture of tortillas during storage. Commercial corn bran was alkaline treated to obtain NCB with functionality similar to nixtamalized corn pericarp. Dry <b>masa</b> <b>flour</b> (DMF) (1 kg) was mixed with 0, 50 and 100 g dry basis of NCB and processed into tortillas. Tortillas containing NCB had a pH of 9, were more flexible and rollable than control tortillas. Alkaline pH tortillas puffed during baking; these tortillas were yellow with a soft, moist texture. Tortillas containing nixtamalized rice and wheat brans were soft and flexible. A sensory panel found that tortillas containing nixtamalized cereal brans had a strong alkaline flavor and aroma and a blistered surface, with a soft, moist texture. NCB tortillas had the highest overall acceptability scores. Pericarp from nixtamal and alkaline pH slowed the staling mechanisms of tortillas. Nixtamalized commercial brans significantly improved the texture of corn tortillas during storage and enhanced the color, flavor and aroma of DMF tortillas. Nixtamalized cereal brans can be used as an effective additive to extend shelf stability of tortillas and enhance the flavor of DMF products.

Combined effects of barley flour (0 - 2. 5 %), maltogenic amylase (0 - 1650 MAU) and carboxymethylcellulose (0 - 0. 5 %) were evaluated using surface response methodology. Barley flour increased rollability, pliability, energy dissipated and reduced rupture force and final stiffness. Overall, maltogenic amylase decreased rupture force and Young's modulus but decreased rupture distance, rollability and pliability at levels above 825 MAU. CMC improved rollability, pliability, and rupture distance. The best response was found using barley flour and CMC with 825 MAU, where rollability, pliability, rupture distance and energy dissipated increased while rupture force, Young's modulus and final stiffness decreased. A 70 % barley b-glucan concentrate combined with amylase (550 MAU) or CMC (0 - 0. 5 %) was evaluated in corn tortillas. Amylase combined with b-glucan did not improve texture. Tortillas with b-glucan and CMC had significantly improved pliability, rollability, final stiffness and energy dissipated. Texture measurements analysis showed that depending {{on the stage of}} storage, objective and subjective methods correlate differently. Subjective and objective measurements of texture were not correlated at 4 hr storage. At the end of storage, pliability had significant correlations with stress relaxation measurements, but rollability had higher correlation coefficients with extensibility measurements. Pliability had higher R 2 and lower coefficients of variation compared to rollability. Sensory evaluation was conducted using reheated 14 -day-old tortillas of control, 825 MAU with 0. 25 % CMC, 0. 12 % b-glucans, 0. 18 % b-glucan with 0. 375 % CMC, and 0. 24 % b-glucan with 0. 25 % CMC. All tortillas had similar appearance, flexibility, gumminess, flavor and overall quality. Softness and chewiness of treatments with 0. 12 % b-glucan or 0. 24 % b-glucan with 0. 25 % CMC were similar to control.

Masa was sheeted, baked, cut, equilibrated and fried to produce tortillas and chips using pilot plant equipment. The color (L, a, b), pH, and moisture content of tortillas and chips were determined. Fat content of chips was determined with NIR. Tortillas and chips became darker above pH 7. 5 and 6. 4, respectively. A decrease in lightness was accompanied by an increase in a dull, yellow color. No darkening was observed in tortillas and chips at pH < 6. 4. The minimum level of glucose, lysine and ferulic acid required to participate in the Maillard reaction was much higher in tortillas than chips with significant darkening occurring during frying. The combination of 50 ppm each of glucose, lysine and ferulic acid (GLF) caused darker chips. The combination of glucose and lysine produced darker chips at lower concentrations compared to all paired combinations of glucose, lysine and ferulic acid. Tortillas and chips prepared with hydrogen peroxide were lighter than untreated tortillas and chips. No lightening was observed by the addition of < 2500 ppm of calcium or benzoyl peroxide. Tortillas and chips prepared with GLF, citric acid and hydrogen peroxide had increased lightness when compared to tortillas and chips prepared with GLF alone. Tortillas fried immediately after baking produced oily chips which had excessive pillowing and poor texture. Chips appeared slightly darker when fried immediately compared to chips equilibrated for longer periods. Thus, equilibration time affects the oil absorption, texture and color of the finished chip. Variations in minor components of corn significantly affect color of white tortillas and tortilla chips...|$|E
