6000|$|... "Pardon! I {{simply said}} {{my name was}} Hoffman. You did not ask <b>me</b> <b>point</b> blank if I was the baron; had you done so, I think I should have confessed all, for {{it was very hard}} to {{restrain}} myself this morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Everybody {{is quite}} welcome {{to know my}} age," [...] said Miss Fosbrook, the colour rising in her cheek. [...] "I was {{nineteen}} on the last of April; but I had rather you had asked <b>me</b> <b>point</b> blank, Henry, than {{tried to find out}} in a sidelong way." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{produced}} {{one from}} his pocket, and, placing it before <b>me,</b> <b>pointed</b> to a paragraph.|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{will be your}} luggage, I suppose?" [...] {{said the}} man rather {{abruptly}} when he saw <b>me,</b> <b>pointing</b> to my trunk in the passage.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look," [...] said Orme to <b>me,</b> <b>pointing</b> to the mountains, [...] "they {{are still}} miles away. It was madness {{to think that}} we could reach them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{this man}} were really fond of Laura {{he would show}} proper {{consideration}} for Laura's father. It was only yesterday that I asked him for a loan-condescended actually to ask for it--I, who have been within an ace of being Mayor of Birmingham! And he refused <b>me</b> <b>point</b> blank." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And what {{a wedding}} we will have!" [...] exclaimed Johanna; [...] "it shall be truly baronial. I will take my hood and go {{at once to}} {{neighbour}} Sophie Lemsberg, who was wife to the Markgraf's Under Keller-Meister. She will tell <b>me</b> <b>point</b> device the ceremonies befitting the espousals of a baron's widow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But, {{if it ever}} should be, tell me so, my dear child. Entrust {{the truth}} to <b>me,</b> <b>point</b> out the object of such an {{interest}} to me, and I will try with all the zeal, and honour, and friendship and respect that I feel for you, good Little Dorrit of my heart, to do you a lasting service.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{be able to}} {{recognize}} him anywhere, no matter how he was dressed, an' so would Dan, for Sam an' <b>me</b> <b>pointed</b> him out two or three times." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was past}} one {{o'clock in the}} morning when I {{returned}} to the hotel, yet the porter who admitted <b>me</b> <b>pointed</b> toward the figure of a man who stood waiting in the dimly lit hall.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here is {{a gentleman}} coming," [...] {{she said to}} <b>me,</b> <b>pointing</b> in the {{direction}} of Ramsgate. [...] "You can never walk back. Shall we ask him to send a chaise from Broadstairs to the gap in the cliff?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As I said in {{our meeting}} in your park, Mr. Eldredge," [...] replied Middleton, [...] "such a {{suggestion}} may very possibly be true; yet let <b>me</b> <b>point</b> {{out that the}} long lapse of years, and the continual melting and dissolving of family institutions--the consequent scattering of family documents, and the annihilation of traditions from memory, all conspire against its probability." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear young man," [...] the {{professor}} said earnestly, [...] "let <b>me</b> <b>point</b> {{out to you}} that this is a wonderful position in which you have been placed. You ought to be most proud and grateful. Any trifling inconveniences which may result should be, I venture to say, utterly ignored by you. Now come, {{let me ask you a}} question. Are you feeling absolutely your--how shall I call it--revised self to-day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Refused <b>me</b> <b>point</b> blank!" [...] {{cried the}} old man excitedly. [...] "It was against his principles, if you please. But I'll be even with him--you see if I am not. I know one or two things about him. What is it they call him at the Three Pigeons? A 'smasher'--that's the word-a coiner of false money. Why else should he have this metal sent him, and that great smoky chimney of his going all day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|O Agnes, O my soul, so may thy face be by me when I {{close my}} life indeed; so may I, when realities are melting from me, like the shadows which I now dismiss, still find thee near <b>me,</b> <b>pointing</b> upward! ...|$|R
50|$|In {{its first}} year, Grampian {{produced}} nine regular regional programmes - namely News and Views (a thrice-weekly magazine programme), Country Focus, Women's World, Serenade, Scotland for <b>Me,</b> <b>Points</b> North (a long-running current affairs programme), Grampian Golf, local news bulletins and monthly church services.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. David Dickson kindly furnishes {{us with an}} {{explanation}} of the letter dated 10th May. [...] "It was," [...] he says, [...] "in answer to a letter from <b>me,</b> <b>pointing</b> out that the 'Shepherd' in 'Pickwick' was apparently reflecting on the scriptural doctrine of the new birth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Leonard, Leonard," [...] cried Juanna in English, {{addressing}} him for {{the first}} time by his Christian name, as even then he noticed, but looking straight before her that none might guess to whom she spoke. [...] "These priests are going to kill you and all of us, except Otter and myself. If you can, when you see <b>me</b> <b>point</b> with my hand, shoot that man who is about to sacrifice the king. Make no answer." ...|$|E
60|$|In conclusion, let <b>me</b> <b>point</b> {{out that}} even those, who are obliged to study Formal Logic, {{with a view to}} being able to answer Examination-Papers in that subject, will find the study of Symbolic Logic most helpful for this purpose, in {{throwing}} light upon many of the obscurities with which Formal Logic abounds, and in furnishing a delightfully easy method of testing the results arrived at by the cumbrous processes which Formal Logic enforces upon its votaries.|$|E
60|$|But I {{cease to}} dwell on the stores of {{excellent}} examples to be drawn from the ancient chronicles of the Manhattoes. He who reads attentively will discover the threads of gold which run throughout the web of history, and are invisible to the dull eye of ignorance. But before I conclude let <b>me</b> <b>point</b> out a solemn warning furnished in the subtle chain of events by which the capture of Fort Casimir has produced the present convulsions of our globe.|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly, for Amy keeps <b>me</b> <b>pointing</b> due west {{most of the}} time, {{with only}} an {{occasional}} whiffle round to the south, and I haven't had an easterly spell since I was married. Don't {{know anything about the}} north, but am altogether salubrious and balmy, hey, my lady?" ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{suddenly}} they sprang up and rushed towards me, Nobela, the aged Isanusi, at their head. They leaped at <b>me,</b> <b>pointing</b> to <b>me</b> with the tails of the vilderbeestes in their hands. Then Nobela switched {{me in the}} face with the tail of the beast, and cried aloud:-- ...|$|R
5000|$|Doubts emerged {{over whether}} Duggan had {{committed}} suicide given {{the distance of the}} shotgun from the corpse. [...] "You don't shoot yourself with a shotgun with your shoes on," [...] one investigator told <b>me,</b> <b>pointing</b> out that the barrel was so long only a bare toe could have fired the trigger.|$|R
60|$|Poor little boys! My kind true wife! I will Protect {{them from}} thee, Landvogt! When I drew That bowstring, and {{my hand was}} quiv'ring, And with devilish joy thou mad'st <b>me</b> <b>point</b> it At the child, and I in fainting anguish Entreated thee in vain; then with a grim Irrevocable oath, deep in my soul, I vow'd to God in Heav'n, that the next aim I took should be thy heart. The vow I made In that despairing moment's agony Became a holy debt; and I will pay it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let <b>me</b> <b>point</b> out {{the power}} of but one of them, the {{railroad}} group. It employs forty thousand lawyers to defeat {{the people in the}} courts. It issues countless thousands of free passes to judges, bankers, editors, ministers, university men, members of state legislatures, and of Congress. It maintains luxurious lobbies* at every state capital, and at the national capital; and in all the cities and towns of the land it employs an immense army of pettifoggers and small politicians whose business is to attend primaries, pack conventions, get on juries, bribe judges, and in every way to work for its interests.** ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] he continued, whilst {{suddenly}} {{the young girl}} seemed {{to see the whole}} thing as in a vision, [...] "they did not forget a single detail--follow them with <b>me,</b> <b>point</b> by point. Two cunning scoundrels--geniuses they should be called--well provided with some ill-gotten funds--but determined on a grand coup. They play at respectability, for six months, say. One is the master, the other the servant; they take a house in the same street as their intended victim, make friends with him, accomplish one or two creditable but very small business transactions, always drawing on the reserve funds, which might even have amounted to a few hundreds--and a bit of credit.|$|E

40|$|Speaking {{about the}} title of this presentation, I {{remember}} the comment that Simha Arom made me last year taking an interest in the aspects I was going to base my exposition on today.

60|$|Before passing {{to other}} {{developments}} of this general view, let <b>me</b> <b>point</b> out how not simply animal-worship is thus accounted for, {{but also the}} conception, so variously illustrated in ancient legends, that animals are capable of displaying human powers of speech and thought and action. Mythologies are full of stories of beasts and birds and fishes that have played intelligent parts in human affairs--creatures that have befriended particular persons by giving them information, by guiding them, by yielding them help; or else that have deceived them, verbally or otherwise. Evidently all these traditions, {{as well as those}} about abductions of women by animals and fostering of children by them, fall naturally into their places as results of the habitual misinterpretation I have described.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} speak {{very much at}} your ease," [...] cried I. [...] "What else was I to do? It is a fact I might have hired some decent, poor woman to be a third to us, and I declare I {{never thought of it}} until this moment! But where was I to find her, that am a {{foreigner}} myself? And let <b>me</b> <b>point</b> out to your observation, Mr. Drummond, that it would have cost me money out of my pocket. For here is just what it comes to, that I had to pay through the nose for your neglect; and there is only the one story to it, just that you were so unloving and so careless as to have lost your daughter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you. That'll do, Charlie, come along," [...] said Oliver, {{turning into}} one of the narrow {{passages}} that diverged from the main street of Newlyn, and ascending the hill with giant strides; [...] "one should never be particular in their inquiries after a place. When I'm told to turn to the right after the second turning to the left, and that if I go right on till I come to some other turning, that will conduct <b>me</b> <b>point</b> blank to the street that enters the square near to which lies the spot I wish to reach, I'm apt to get confused. Get a general direction if possible, the position indicated by compass is almost enough, and ask again. That's my plan, and I never found it fail." ...|$|E
25|$|Well, no, no, I mean he's {{making an}} appeal using his family to gain support. I think it's pretty obvious to anyone {{watching}} what he's been doing. I do not think he himself is racist.

60|$|A polite clerk {{waited on}} <b>me</b> and <b>pointed</b> out the {{directory}} {{lying on a}} stand.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll tell you. I {{was walking}} down the great street there, going to the harbour; and I saw a crowd of boys--men they call them here--going into a large doorway. So I asked one of them what was doing, and the fellow, instead of {{answering}} <b>me,</b> <b>pointed</b> at my legs, and set all the other monkeys laughing. So I boxed his ears, and he tumbled down.' ...|$|R
