40|$|AbstractFinite element {{models of}} wood {{baseball}} bats are {{a valuable tool}} to explore the relationship between bat profile and bat durability. However, for such finite element models to be credible, the material models must capture the mechanical response of the wood under consideration. In the current research, a comprehensive experimental program was conducted to characterize the mechanical behavior of maple and ash woods for the range of densities used to make <b>major-league</b> quality <b>baseball</b> bats. The test program included (1) four-point bend testing to determine elastic moduli and strength and (2) Charpy testing to determine strain to failure {{as a function of}} strain rate and wood density. The material parameters were subsequently calibrated by completing finite element simulations of the Charpy tests in LS-DYNA using the MAT_WOOD material model. This paper describes the experimental characterization program used to determine material parameters of maple and ash wood species for use in finite element simulations of wood baseball bats...|$|R
2500|$|The Arizona Fall League is an {{off-season}} league run by Major League Baseball, and {{consists of}} six teams made up {{of some of the}} most talented minor league players in baseball. [...] Unlike baseball's minor leagues, like AAA teams, the teams are not affiliated with a single major-league team. [...] Each of the six teams is affiliated with five major league teams, all of which send seven players to the fall league. Most of the players come from AAA and AA teams. Many famous major-leaguers have played in the league throughout the years; perhaps the most notable was Michael Jordan in 1994, during his attempt to play <b>major-league</b> <b>baseball.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Regardless {{of their}} {{disagreements}} over television rights, when the Blue Jays reached the 1992 World Series, the team honoured Bronfman's contributions in bringing Major League Baseball {{to the country}} by having him throw the ceremonial first pitch for the first World Series game played in Canada. However, and while Blue Jays president Paul Godfrey again acknowledged the Expos' role in his own team's existence, Godfrey nonetheless voted with the other teams to support contracting the Expos in 2001 and relocating them in 2004: [...] "I know if it wasn't {{for the success of}} the Expos in those early years there would not be <b>major-league</b> <b>baseball</b> in Toronto. That wasn't an emotional or a baseball vote. It was a business decision." [...] The Blue Jays' failure to stand with their fellow Canadian team offended many Expos fans.|$|E
2500|$|The {{last major}} issue of Chavous' third term {{on the council}} was funding for Nationals Park. Major League Baseball was willing to move the Montreal Expos to Washington, D.C., which had long sought a <b>major-league</b> <b>baseball</b> franchise, {{but only if the}} city built a modern, baseball-only stadium for the team. By early June 2003, most of the District Council opposed the initial {{financing}} plan submitted by Williams. [...] Chavous was the lone undecided councilmember. (Harold Brazil was the only supporter.) Chavous supported the stadium plan only after he had lost the September 14 Democratic primary. But he remained largely quiet during council debates, and was still considered a swing vote by November. On November 3, he provided the critical third vote on the council's Economic Development Committee, which approved the stadium deal. Twenty-seven days later, he joined with a narrow majority on the council to win final approval for the project. Chavous twice more voted to approve the stadium financing arrangement in December, when the financing mechanism was amended.|$|E
