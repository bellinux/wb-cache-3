25|$|Tax {{avoidance}} {{strategies and}} loopholes tend to emerge within income tax codes. They get created when taxpayers find legal methods {{to avoid paying}} taxes.

25|$|In the 1970s, the {{population}} increased by 15% and national income increased {{at an annual}} rate of about 4%.

30|$|The size of {{this effect}} depends on the {{magnitude}} of the changes in social insurance program rules, which I have quantified elsewhere in terms of implicit <b>marginal</b> labor <b>income</b> tax rate changes (Mulligan 2012). Statutory <b>marginal</b> labor <b>income</b> tax rates facing the typical household head or spouse at the middle of the skill distribution increased about eight percentage points, and thereby reduced the after-tax return to working by almost fifteen percent, in less than two years.

40|$|Fixed effects {{models are}} the gold {{standard}} in empirical well-being research, however, their applicability is limited to controlling for intercept heterogeneity and identifying effects of timevarying variables. This paper investigates the usefulness of random coecient models in con- trolling for heterogeneity in well-being and the <b>marginal</b> utility of <b>income,</b> and explores whether these forms of heterogeneity depend on the Big-Five personality traits. Using unique Australian longitudinal data that have personality measures available in two time periods we show that a Mundlak-adjusted random coeffcient model yields almost identical results as the mixed effects model, making it a powerful modelling alternative when interest lies in multiple forms of heterogeneity. Big-Five personality explains 10 percent {{of the variation in}} intercept heterogeneity and 6 - 7 percent of the variation in the <b>marginal</b> utility of <b>income.</b> For women, we suggest that the <b>marginal</b> utility of <b>income</b> is significantly linked to personality, implying important gender-differences in the expected effectiveness of financial incentives to influence behaviour.

2500|$|Economist Alan B. Krueger {{wrote in}} 2012: [...] "The rise in {{inequality}} in the United States {{over the last}} three decades has reached the point that inequality in incomes is causing an unhealthy division in opportunities, and is a threat to our economic growth. Restoring a greater degree of fairness to the U.S. job market would be good for businesses, good for the economy, and good for the country." [...] Krueger wrote that the significant shift in the share of income accruing to the top 1% over the 1979 to 2007 period represented nearly $1.1 trillion in annual income. Since the wealthy tend to save nearly 50% of their <b>marginal</b> <b>income</b> while the remainder of the population saves roughly 10%, other things equal this would reduce annual consumption (the largest component of GDP) by as much as 5%. Krueger wrote that borrowing likely helped many households make up for this shift, which became more difficult {{in the wake of the}} 2007–2009 recession.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a two-type, self-selection, overlapping generations model with nonlinear labor income and capital income taxation and public good provision, when {{people care about}} their relative consumption compared to others. In each case, the standard optimality expressions are modified by terms that reflect {{the extent to which}} people care about relative consumption. The modified tax formulas imply substantially higher <b>marginal</b> labor <b>income</b> tax rates than in the conventional case, under plausible assumptions and available empirical estimates regarding comparison consumption concerns. The extent to which the public good provision rule should be modified is shown to depend critically on the preference elicitation format. The effects of positionality on the <b>marginal</b> capital <b>income</b> tax rates are ambiguous.

[...] The bill would delay the budget sequestration by two months, and bill includes $600 billion over ten years in new tax revenue relative to extending 2012 levels, which is about one-fifth of the revenue that would have been raised had no legislation been passed. [...] The revenue would come from increased <b>marginal</b> <b>income</b> and capital gains tax rates relative to their 2012 levels for annual income over $400,000 for individuals and $450,000 for couples; a phase-out of certain tax deductions and credits for those with incomes over $250,000 for individuals and $300,000 for couples, an increase in estate taxes relative to 2012 levels on estates over $5 million, and expiration of the two-year-old cut to payroll taxes, which is applied to income under the Social Security Wage Base, which was $110,100 in 2012. [...] All these changes would all be made permanent. [...] House Speaker John Boehner promised a prompt vote on the Senate bill, but the prospect of the House passing an amended bill raised the prospect that legislation might not be enacted {{by the end of the}} 112th Congress at noon on January 3.
