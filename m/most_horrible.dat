She considered {{the day of her}} liberation as the <b>most</b> <b>horrible</b> day of her life, as she realized that she was alone, her parents and siblings gone. Norman's father, Zacharias Finkelstein, active in Hashomer Hatzair, was a survivor of both the Warsaw Ghetto and the Auschwitz concentration camp.|$|E

In succeeding years he {{is known to have}} had eleven other apprentices. He entered his first copy in the Stationers' Register on 21 July 1577, The true history and faithful relation of a <b>most</b> <b>horrible</b> murder committed by Alphonse Diazius. On 7 April 1579 he entered Thomas Salter's The mirror of modesty, and dedicated it to his wife's step-mother, Lady Anne Lodge.

500|$|Although {{the film}} {{develops}} on these themes of oppression, both {{the narrator and}} Pintilie {{look back on the}} age of Greater Romania with a dose of nostalgia.

[...] Variety argues: [...] "The frantic crescendo of the final sequence has an eerie resonance, as the narrator's final remarks reframe all that has gone before in a different, deeply ironic light." [...] Discussing this aspect, Pintilie stated: [...] "Maybe I'm even a bit perverse to begin the film in a light and playful way: people fall into the trap of thinking it's not a serious film." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{persecution}} of the Jews in Hungary soon became well known abroad, unlike {{the full extent}} of the Holocaust. At the end of May 1944, George Mantello publicized two important reports. One of the reports was probably Rabbi Chaim Michael Dov Weissmandl's five-page abridged version of the 33-page Auschwitz Protocols: both the Vrba–Wetzler report and Rosin-Mordowicz report. The reports described in detail the operations of the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp. The second was a 6-page Hungarian report, that detailed the Ghettoization and deportation of 435,000 already deported Hungarian Jews, updated to 19 June 1944, town by town, to Auschwitz. The report's publication resulted in Winston Churchill's letter: [...] "There is no doubt that this {{persecution of}} Jews in Hungary and their expulsion from enemy territory is probably the greatest and <b>most</b> <b>horrible</b> crime ever committed in the whole history of the world...." ...|$|E

They {{make you feel like}} the <b>most</b> <b>horrible</b> person in the world and that your house is the temple of doom." [...] "Bye Bye Nerdie" [...] features a scene based specifically on this instance in which a saleswoman (voiced by cast member Tress MacNeille) selling childproofing items visits Homer and Marge and exaggerates the dangers in their home. NRBQ's song [...] "Always Safety First" [...] is played during a montage in the episode in which Homer is seen improving the safety of the infants of Springfield.|$|E
500|$|Even in prison, Lim was hated; {{his fellow}} prisoners abused and treated {{him as an}} outcast. In the years that {{followed}} the crime, memories remained fresh among those who followed the case. [...] Journalists deemed it the most sensational trial of the 80s, being [...] "the talk of a horrified city as gruesome accounts of sexual perversion, the drinking of human blood, spirit possession, exorcism and indiscriminate cruelty unfolded during the 41-day hearing". [...] Fifteen years from the trial's conclusion, a poll conducted by The New Paper reported that 30 per cent of its respondents had picked the Toa Payoh ritual murders as the <b>most</b> <b>horrible</b> crime, despite the paper's request to vote only for crimes committed in 1998. [...] Lim had become a benchmark for local criminals; in 2002 Subhas Anandan described his client, wife-killer Anthony Ler, as a [...] "cooler, more handsome version of [...] notorious Toa Payoh medium-murderer".|$|E

His earnest words on his return to take the rule of this unhappy realm were these: 'Let God but grant me life, and there shall not be a spot in my realm where the key shall not keep the castle, and the bracken bush the cow, though I should lead the life of a dog to accomplish it.' ...|$|R

After {{half an hour of}} coaxing, Frusciante agreed to play the show, though he asserted it would be his last. Kiedis recalled of the situation: [...] "It was the <b>most</b> <b>horrible</b> show ever. Every single note, every single word, hurt, knowing that we were no longer a band. I kept looking over at John and seeing this dead statue of disdain... And that night, John disappeared from the topsy-turvy world of the Red Hot Chili Peppers."

I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. [...] I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes.

500|$|Voltaire {{actively}} rejected Leibnizian optimism {{after the}} natural disaster, {{convinced that if}} this were the best possible world, it should surely be better than it is. In both Candide and Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne ("Poem on the Lisbon Disaster"), Voltaire attacks this optimist belief. He makes use of the Lisbon earthquake in both Candide and his Poème to argue this point, sarcastically describing the catastrophe as one of the <b>most</b> <b>horrible</b> disasters [...] "in {{the best of all possible}} worlds". Immediately after the earthquake, unreliable rumours circulated around Europe, sometimes overestimating the severity of the event. Ira Wade, a noted expert on Voltaire and Candide, has analysed which sources Voltaire might have referenced in learning of the event. Wade speculates that Voltaire's primary source for information on the Lisbon earthquake was the 1755 work Relation historique du Tremblement de Terre survenu à Lisbonne by Ange Goudar.|$|E
