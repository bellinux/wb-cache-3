40|$|Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) {{technology}} {{is going to}} be a viable alternative for future generation wireless broadband services in order to meet the striving requirements for throughput and system robustness. In Long Term Evolution (LTE), MIMO technologies have been broadly used to get better downlink peak rate, cell coverage, as well as average cell throughput. In the present paper a 2 x 2 MIMO is taken as baseline configuration for a LTE downlink under a Microcellular propagation scenario considering a non physical correlation based channel with Poor and rich scattering environment. The throughput capacity of the downlink is obtained for poor and rich scattering environments. Besides, two vital aspects of MIMO technique viz Spatial Multiplexing (SM) and Transmit Diversity (TD) are investigated in order to see their effect on throughput of the system. The effect of parameters like Speed of <b>mobile</b> <b>station,</b> <b>number</b> of Multipath, Rician factor (K) on throughput of such systems is reported and discussed. The investigations reported in this paper helps in estimating the throughput capacity of LTE downlink under SM and TD mode. Comment: 1...|$|E

40|$|A {{statistical}} multiplexing scheme in orthogonal downlinks is proposed to accommodate more downlink orthogonal channels than orthogonal codewords for <b>mobile</b> <b>stations.</b> The <b>number</b> of allocable downlink orthogonal channels {{depends on the}} average burstiness of the channels. The {{statistical multiplexing}} scheme is called here as the orthogonal code hopping multiplexing (OCHM). Since the OCHM uses a pre-allocated independent hopping pattern for each <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> (MS), the <b>number</b> of transactions for channel allocation and de-allocation can be smaller than the conventional downlink orthogonal multiplexing scheme. Since the number of available codewords in orthogonal code for OCHM is limited (for cdmaOne, it is 64) and the hopping patterns are mutually independent, the hopping patterns for two or more synchronous downlink channels may collide. In this case all the encoded symbols colliding in the downlink channels are not transmitted (punctured) except when all the encoded symbols are the same. The punctured (not transmitted) encoded symbols are recovered at the receiver by channel decoding. ...|$|R

A MSRN is assigned for every mobile terminated call, not only the calls where the terminating MS lives on a different MSC than the originating MS. Although this seems unnecessary since many vendors' VLR's are integrated with the MSC, the GSM specification indicates that the MSC and VLR (Visitor Location Register) do not need to reside on the same switch. They are considered two different nodes as they have their own routing addresses. The MSRN is one of the returned parameters into SRI_Response message.

The system state is estimated based on a number of counters that are collected by the MAC layer of the <b>mobile</b> <b>station,</b> regarding the <b>number</b> of successful and unsuccessful transmission/reception events, channel busy periods and idle slots. These statistics are processed to estimate the collision probability and the signal to noise ratio at the receiver side. Hence, a mathematical model is used to get the expected end-to-end network performance in terms of throughput, delay and packet error rate, for different settings of some PHY and MAC parameters, such as the modulation/coding scheme and the retransmission limit. The setting that is estimated to maximize the quality of service for the end user is then selected. Unlike other optimization mechanisms proposed in literature, APOS is totally stand-alone and standard compliant. In fact, APOS makes use of local information that can be collected from the Network Interface Card, and no explicit interactions with the other devices in the network is required...|$|R
40|$|The project {{explains}} Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems {{when used}} with Multiple-Input, MultipleOutput (MIMO) fulfill the growing demands in throughput and system robustness for the user. This is investigated by understanding the throughput capacity of LTE down-links in both spatial multiplexing and transmission diversity mode. The performance downgrades in LTE frame is analyzed. All the simulations {{are done in}} MATLAB. The simulations include Bit Error Rate (BER) being verified for values of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). MIMO systems use more than one antenna configuration for sending and receiving radio signals of the same frequency. The concept of beam forming may be utilized by MIMO systems. This is done by employing more than one antenna at both the ends namely transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx). The use of multiple antennas will achieve higher capacity and better cell coverage. MIMO technologies, when used in LTE, provide better down-link peak rates, cell coverage, and enhanced average cell throughput. LTE offers increased capacity while using standard antenna technique. This technique provides two vital aspects namely, spatial multiplexing (SM) and transmits diversity (TD).
