5000|$|Wood pulp {{produced}} {{primarily by}} grinding wood {{is known as}} [...] "mechanical pulp" [...] and is used mainly for newsprint. These mechanical processes use fewer chemicals than either kraft or sulfite mills. The primary source of pollution from these mills is organic material such as resin acids released from the wood when it is processed. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>wood</b> <b>pulp</b> is [...] "brightened," [...] as opposed to bleached, using less toxic chemicals than are needed for chemical pulps.|$|E

Bangladesh is the second largest importer of Canadian food grains and other agricultural products in South Asia. Moreover, potential areas of trade from Bangladesh to Canada are shipbuilding, pharmaceuticals, leather and leather goods and IT.|$|R
40|$|In {{the process}} of {{recycling}} paper, printing inks are removed but even after the most efficient de-inking, some particles remain. These particles strongly affect the brightness and shade of printing papers made from the recycled pulp. The reason for measuring the brightness without being disturbed by dirt specks is to more efficiently control {{the process of}} bleaching in a recycled fibre process. There is no use of trying to bleach the dirt specks, only the fibres can be bleached and therefore this is the material which is interesting to measure. It {{is not possible to}} measure the fibre brightness (reflectance factor) in a conventional instrument such as the Elrepho or other corresponding instrument without including any dirt specks in the sample. This work aimed at implementing a method in which the brightness of paper is evaluated from an image, where dirt specks can be identified and removed by image processing, thus giving a measurement of the fibres only. An existing instrument, Colour Dirt Speck Counter, was investigated with this purpose. A calibration routine was implemented. Several different light sources were tested, with the purpose of getting reliable measurements of the reflectance factor of paper at short wavelengths. Samples made of pure <b>mechanical</b> <b>wood</b> <b>pulps</b> were evaluated; the result from the Elrepho was regarded as a reference since it is the standard instrument. The Colour Dirt Speck Counter ranked the samples in the same order as the Elrepho if data were evaluated at the intensity peak of a white LED illumination, 470 nm. No other light source gave this result. A considerable variation between the darkest and brightest pixel was found in the images. It is suggested that {{this is due to the}} structure of the paper where fibres appear brighter than the spaces between them...|$|R
40|$|FT Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{is being}} increasingly applied {{in studies of}} wood and other lignocellulosic materials. TO develop FT Raman as an analytical tool, spectra of such materials need to be interpreted and understood. TO accomplish this objective, the contribution {{of each of the}} material-components to the Raman spectrum needs to be identified and, for a given component, spectral features need to be interpreted in terms of its various chemical groups and/or structural units. In the case of black spruce, the contribution of lignin was identified by using the spectra of milled wood, enzyme, and native lignins (the latter was obtained by subtracting the spectrum of acid chlorite delignified wood from the spectrum of extractives free wood). Moreover, information gleaned from the spectra of lignin model compounds and chemically modified <b>wood,</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps,</b> and milled <b>wood</b> lignin was used in the band assignment work...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} craftsmen's and merchants' settlement {{left of the}} Elbe with surviving timber-framed {{houses that}} were mentioned as early as 1379 has been a summer resort {{since the end of}} the 19th century, when development of tourism began. The village was the sphere of action of the Krippen villager and inventor of <b>mechanical</b> <b>wood</b> <b>pulp</b> for the manufacture of paper, Friedrich Gottlob Keller (1816-95), from 1853 to his death. A memorial tablet on the Keller Museum, house number 76 in the main road named after him and in which the inventor once lived, celebrates him and his work. In 2009, Krippen had a population of 568 (1999: 720).|$|E
50|$|Hällefors {{used to be}} {{the seat}} of Hellefors Bruks AB, which in the early 20th century was one of the largest {{manufacturing}} companies in central Sweden. It produced iron and steel, <b>mechanical</b> <b>wood</b> <b>pulp,</b> sulfite and sulfate pulp, sawn timber, joinery and box boards. It mined, for its own requirements and for sale, ore from its own iron ore fields. At a large number of its own power stations, situated on Svartälven and its tributaries, the company produced electrical energy which was widely distributed to its own works and outside customers. The company also grew timber on a large scale, and an extensive private railway system runs right through the company's forests which cover several hundred thousand acres in Hällefors and surrounding municipalities. The general management of the company was at Hällefors, where the company operated ironworks, a wood-grinding mill, a sawmill, a box factory and joinery works.|$|E
40|$|Two of the {{drawbacks}} of using natural-based composites in industrial applications are thermal instability and water uptake capacity. In this work, <b>mechanical</b> <b>wood</b> <b>pulp</b> {{was used to}} reinforce polypropylene {{at a level of}} 20 to 50 wt. %. Composites were mixed by means of a Brabender internal mixer for both non-coupled and coupled formulations. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to determine the thermal properties of the composites. The water uptake behavior was evaluated by immersion of the composites in water until an equilibrium state was reached. Results of water absorption tests revealed that the amount of water absorption was clearly dependent upon the fiber content. The coupled composites showed lower water absorption compared to the uncoupled composites. The incorporation of <b>mechanical</b> <b>wood</b> <b>pulp</b> into the polypropylene matrix produced a clear nucleating effect by increasing the crystallinity degree of the polymer and also increasing the temperature of polymer degradation. The maximum degradation temperature for stone ground wood pulp–reinforced composites was in the range of 330 to 345 º...|$|E

40|$|According to Food and Agriculture Organization {{newsprint}} {{is defined}} as: Uncoated paper, unsized (or only slightly sized), containing at least 60 percent of <b>mechanical</b> <b>wood</b> <b>pulp.</b> The consumption of newsprint in Sweden {{was just over}} 798 000 tonnes in 2009, which represents approximately 90 kg per person. Although there are studies that predict a drastic reduction in newsprint consumption in the Western world, {{there seems to be}} a clear difference between forecasts for the future given by statistical analysis of newsprint consumption and forecasts given by experts in the industry. The former predict a continuing increase while the experts see a coming decrease in consumption. In this report, both demand and business strategies of newsprint in Sweden are studied. The study also presents a forecast of the future which is based on historical data and qualitative interviews. According to the regression analysis done in this research the consumption will increase with an increase in GDP. However, the qualitative interviews are pointing to another direction. Experts in the newsprint industry believe the increase in consumption of newsprint in Sweden will slow down over time and it might even decrease in total. This will probably largely depend on the development of information and communications technology such as Internet, e-readers and mobile phones. Business strategies for meeting the structural difference, that may appear in the future, varies from different parts of the industry. Newspapers are trying to create as attractive a product as possible regardless of whether it is in printed or digital form. Printing firms are trying to find additional customers for continued profitability. Paper mills strive to do as good a product as possible to compete and they try to sell more in the more profitable segments. The one similarity between the various parts in the industry is that everyone is trying to streamline their production...|$|E
30|$|DR {{has been}} {{traditionally}} {{defined as a}} set of time dependent activities that reduce, shed or shift electricity use to improve electric grid reliability and manage costs, which mainly relies on customers’ motivation for reducing electricity tariff [14]. For AS, technical requirements are more challenging in terms of speed and accuracy when compared with traditional DR. Specifically, DR for AS is needed year-round and not just for peak hours [15]. Different works have been presented in the past in order to evaluate DR for AS in different sectors. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has carried out a lot of research about DR for AS under the framework of smart grid and verified a series of power loads which have the ability to provide AS by experiment and demonstration project, such as lighting, air conditioning, refrigeration, data center and water pumping, etc [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Reference [22] examined the characteristics of cement plants and their ability to shed or shift load to participate in DR. Reference [23] identified that six hours of load shifting could be achieved without adversely affecting production at a South African cement plant. Reference [24, 25] investigated the available opportunities of one aluminum smelter factory in AS market and discussed the regulation service that electrolytic aluminum enterprises could provide. Reference [26] analyzed the flexibility potential of customers in one meat industry based on the management of the most energy consuming process in this type of segment: cooling production and distribution, {{which is one of the}} most representative sectors in Spain. Reference [27] briefly estimated the technical and economic potential of energy-intensive industries to provide demand side management in electricity and balance markets through 2030, including chloralkali process, <b>mechanical</b> <b>wood</b> <b>pulp</b> production, aluminum electrolysis, electric arc furnace, cement mills. However, all the aforementioned analyses are limited in that they are case studies for a single industrial plant or sector, and they have not investigated the economic influence and low-carbon benefit of IDRR for AS through day-ahead optimizing dispatching.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the history of traditional Korean papermaking within its historical context: {{the relationship with the}} development of papermaking techniques in neighbouring countries were examined though primary focus was given to the development of materials and tools used. In order to understand the characteristics of historical Korean paper and the development of tools and materials used over time, surveys on Korean and Japanese collections at the British Library and a private Korean collection were carried out. Korean objects dated between the 12 th and the 18 th century were examined. The data collected from the surveys was compiled in a database and analysed. The data analysis revealed that the thickness of paper was closely related to the thickness of bamboo splints used in manufacture of papermaking screens. Research also included a summary of morphological characteristics and photomicrographs of fibres from nine indigenous plants which were used for traditional Korean papermaking. These standard fibre samples were used as reference to identify the fibres of unknown paper objects surveyed. This fibre identification confirmed the main material to be paper mulberry and, additionally, provided information on supplementary materials including rice straw, reed, hemp, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>wood</b> <b>pulp</b> of coniferous origin — a material that has not been recognised as one of the common supplementary materials in previous studies. In order to provide {{a better understanding of the}} materials and tools used in traditional papermaking in Korea, three papermaking experiments were carried out. Firstly, a papermaking experiment was conducted using a mucilaginous substance derived from the roots of Hibiscus Manihot, which has been employed as a formation aid for considerable time in Korea and Japan. Paper samples were then analysed to investigate the physical influence of the substance on the sample sheets. Secondly, a fixed laid screen was designed and sheets were produced using it. The intention here was to support a hypothesis which was proposed by the author in order to explain a possible chronological development of papermaking mould structure in China and its potential spread to neighbouring countries. The last experiment was conducted to simulate a technique of papermaking with reclaimed paper. Although the use of reclaimed paper was recorded in early literature, details of the process were unknown...|$|E

Da mesma forma, busca-se aumentar a sustentabilidade dos processos fabris com maior utilizaÃÂÃÂo de insumos energÃÂticos renovÃÂveis, tais como biomassa celulÃÂsica. Este trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar o potencial de aproveitamento energÃÂtico de resÃÂduos celulÃÂsicos de fÃÂbrica de papel-cartÃÂo (fibras residuais da estaÃÂÃÂo de tratamento de efluentes Ãââ lodo da ETE, fibras e fiapos de fabricaÃÂÃÂo de pasta mecÃÂnica de madeira) na combustÃÂo em mistura com cavacos e cascas de madeira, convencionalmente utilizados na geraÃÂÃÂo de vapor. O poder calorÃÂfico dos combustÃÂveis; cavacos e cascas de madeira e dos resÃÂduos; fibras e fiapos de madeira, lodo da ETE e cinzas de caldeira foi estimado por correlaÃÂÃÂo com base nas anÃÂlises imediata e elementar desses materiais para elaborar o balanÃÂo energÃÂtico da caldeira. O balanÃÂo indicou que a quantidade de energia liberada nos gases de exaustÃÂo da chaminÃÂ da caldeira ÃÂ suficiente para secar o lodo da ETE, reduzindo sua umidade inicial de 55 % para 20 % e para secar fibras e fiapos de madeira, reduzindo sua umidade de 80 % para 20 %. A secagem desses resÃÂduos, em secador de biomassa, permite aumentar o poder calorÃÂfico do lodo da ETE em 55 % e das fibras e fiapos em 88 %, possibilitando a queima em mistura com a biomassa (cavacos e cascas de madeira) atualmente utilizada na caldeira da fÃÂbrica. O balanÃÂo com a introduÃÂÃÂo dos resÃÂduos secos; 1, 5 % de fibras e fiapos, 6, 5 % de lodo da ETE, para combustÃÂo em mistura com 89, 8 % de cavacos e 2, 4 % de cascas de madeira, indicou que ÃÂ possÃÂvel a reduÃÂÃÂo de 411 toneladas por mÃÂs no consumo de cavacos e cascas.

O estudo indicou, portanto, que hÃÂ alternativas de melhor aproveitamento energÃÂtico dos resÃÂduos celulÃÂsicos da fÃÂbrica de papel-cartÃÂo. One of {{the biggest}} problems of the pulp and paper industry is the disposal of solid waste in landfills, since available areas are increasingly scarce, besides the environmental impact with the disposal. On the other hand, the aim is to increase the sustainability of manufacturing processes with increased use of renewable energy inputs, like cellulosic biomass. The goal {{of this study is to}} evaluate the energy production potential of cellulosic residues from paperboard mill (fiber sludge from wastewater treatment plant - WWTP, fibers and lint from the production of <b>mechanical</b> <b>wood</b> <b>pulp),</b> in the combustion mixture with wood chips and barks, conventionally used in steam generation. The calorific value of the conventional fuel; wood chips and barks and the cellulosic residues; fibers and wood lint, WWTP sludge and boiler ash were estimated by correlation based on immediate and elemental analyzes of these materials, in order to perform the mass and heat balance of the boiler. The assessment indicated that the amount of energy released in the boiler chimney exhaust gases is sufficient to dry the WWTP sludge, reducing its initial moisture content of 55 % to 20 % and to dry wood fibers and lint, reducing its moisture 80 % to 20 %. The drying of the residues in the biomass dryer, can increase the calorific value of WWTP sludge by 55 % and increase fiber and lint net heat value by 88 %, making possible to burn the dried residues mixed with biomass (wood chips and bark) currently used in the mill boiler. The balance with the introduction of dried residues; 1. 5 % of fibers and lint and 6. 5 % of WWTP sludge, in combustion mixed with 89. 8 % of wood chips and 2. 4 % of wood bark, indicated that it is possible to reduce 411 tons of wood chips and bark per month. A cost-benefit assessment of available technical alternatives was done, in order to compare the economic feasibility of each possibility.
