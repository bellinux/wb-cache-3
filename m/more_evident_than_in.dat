5|$|Domitian's {{tendency}} towards micromanagement {{was nowhere}} <b>more</b> <b>evident</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> his financial policy. The {{question of whether}} Domitian left the Roman Empire in debt or with a surplus {{at the time of}} his death has been fiercely debated. The evidence points to a balanced economy for the greater part of Domitian's reign. Upon his accession he revalued the Roman currency dramatically. He increased the silver purity of the denarius from 90% to 98% — the actual silver weight increasing from 2.87grams to 3.26grams. A financial crisis in 85 forced a devaluation of the silver purity and weight to 93.5% and 3.04grams respectively.|$|E

Even then {{most of the players}} inherited were good for little more than trade bait as the NPSL required that teams could field no more than four imports.

500|$|Façades {{of churches}} often came to {{resemble}} wedding cakes rather than {{places of worship}} as the architects grew in confidence, competence, and stature. Church interiors, which until this date had been slightly pedestrian, came especially in Palermo to be decorated in a riot of inlaid marbles {{of a wide variety}} of colours. Anthony Blunt has described this decoration as [...] "either fascinating or repulsive, but however the individual spectator may react to it, this style is a characteristic manifestation of Sicilian exuberance, and must be classed amongst the most important and original creations of Baroque art on the island". This is the key to Sicilian Baroque; it was ideally matched to the Sicilian personality, and this was the reason it evolved so dramatically on the island. Nowhere in Sicily is the development of the new Baroque style <b>more</b> <b>evident</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> Ragusa and Catania.|$|E

Hemingway has said he believes this avoidance made the heart and thrust of the story all the more acute, writing [...] "'Big Two-Hearted River' is about a boy beat to the wide coming home from the war.... beat to the wide was an earlier and possibly more severe form of beat, since those who had been were unable to comment on this condition and could not suffer that it be mentioned in their presence. So the war, all mention of the war, anything about the war is omitted."

2500|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cultural Revolution (1966–76), the {{education}} system in China has been geared toward economic modernization. In 1985, the national government ceded responsibility for basic education to local governments through the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's [...] "Decision on the Reform of the Educational Structure." [...] In unveiling {{the education}} reform plan in May 1985, the authorities called for nine years of compulsory education and the establishment of the State Education Commission (created the following month). Official commitment to improved education was nowhere <b>more</b> <b>evident</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the substantial increase in funds for education in the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986–90), which amounted to 72 percent more than funds allotted to education in the previous plan period (1981–85). In 1986 some 16.8 percent of the state budget was earmarked for education, compared with 10.4 percent in 1984. Since 1949, education has been a focus of controversy in China. As a result of continual intraparty realignments, official policy alternated between ideological imperatives and practical efforts to further national development. But ideology and pragmatism often have been incompatible. The Great Leap Forward (1958–60) and the Socialist Education Movement (1962–65) sought to end deeply rooted academic elitism, to narrow social and cultural gaps between workers and peasants and between urban and rural populations, and to eliminate the tendency of scholars and intellectuals to disdain manual labor. During the Cultural Revolution, universal fostering of social equality was an overriding priority.|$|E
60|$|This was {{the bold}} and prudent policy of a {{minister}} who {{felt he had}} {{the confidence of the}} country and was sustained by great parliamentary majorities; and when the summoner of monster meetings was convicted, and the efficient though impartial manner in which the labours of the land commission were simultaneously conducted came to be bruited about, there seemed at last some prospect of the system of political quackery of which Ireland had been so long the victim being at last subverted.

6000|$|THE INNER LIFE. A man's life is {{more than}} his work; his dream is ever greater than his achievement; and {{literature}} reflects not so much man's deed as the spirit which animates him; not the poor thing that he does, but rather the splendid thing that he ever hopes to do. In no place is this <b>more</b> <b>evident</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the age we are now studying. Those early sea kings were a marvelous mixture of savagery and sentiment, of rough living and of deep feeling, of splendid courage and the deep melancholy of men who know their limitations and have faced the unanswered problem of death. They were not simply fearless freebooters who harried every coast in their war galleys. If that were all, they would have no more history or literature than the Barbary pirates, of whom the same thing could be said. These strong fathers of ours were men of profound emotions. In all their fighting the love of an untarnished glory was uppermost; and under the warrior's savage exterior was hidden a great love of home and homely virtues, and a reverence for the one woman to whom he would presently return in triumph. So when the wolf hunt was over, or the desperate fight was won, these mighty men would gather in the banquet hall, and lay their weapons aside where the open fire would flash upon them, and there listen to the songs of Scop and Gleeman,--men who could put into adequate words the emotions and aspirations that all men feel but {{that only a few}} can ever express: ...|$|E
40|$|The {{collective}} entrepreneurship {{has proven}} to be fundamental in the context of sustainable rural tourism, a fact that motivated the development of this study in Paraná State, south region of Brazil, where there is a collective experience around tourism. Specifically, this study aims to: a) understand the process of collective entrepreneurship developed between tourism enterprises and b) analyze the possible contributions of collective entrepreneurship to strengthen the tourism entrepreneurs involved. Therefore, it was developed a qualitative and descriptive study. The data were obtained through interviews with the managers of collective initiative, and also from secondary data. The main results show that the collective experience in Paraná State around sustainable rural tourism reveals a pioneering initiative in the region, and the collective entrepreneurship is proved fundamental for triggering this process.

5000|$|The next {{election}} {{was held in}} 1936. It was hotly contested, with all parties converging into three coalitions: the leftist Popular Front, the right-winged [...] and a Centre coalition. In the end, the Popular Front won with a small edge in votes over the runner-up National Front, but achieved a solid majority due to the new electoral system introduced by the CEDA government hoping that they would get the edge in votes. The new Parliament then dismissed Alcalá-Zamora and installed Manuel Azaña in his place. During the third term, the extreme polarisation of the Spanish society was <b>more</b> <b>evident</b> <b>than</b> ever <b>in</b> Parliament, with confrontation reaching the level of death threats.

60|$|This {{combination}} of the widest kindness and consideration with a consistent ungraciousness of tone runs through all Shaw's ethical utterance, and is nowhere <b>more</b> <b>evident</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> his attitude towards animals. He would waste himself to a white-haired shadow to save a shark in an aquarium from inconvenience or to add any little comforts {{to the life of}} a carrion-crow. He would defy any laws or lose any friends to show mercy to the humblest beast or the most hidden bird. Yet I cannot recall in the whole of his works or in the whole of his conversation a single word of any tenderness or intimacy with any bird or beast. It was under the influence of this high and almost superhuman sense of duty that he became a vegetarian; and I seem to remember that when he was lying sick and near to death {{at the end of his}} Saturday Review career he wrote a fine fantastic article, declaring that his hearse ought to be drawn by all the animals that he had not eaten. Whenever that evil day comes there will be no need to fall back on the ranks of the brute creation; there will be no lack of men and women who owe him so much as to be glad to take the place of the animals; and the present writer for one will be glad to express his gratitude as an elephant. There is no doubt about the essential manhood and decency of Bernard Shaw's instincts in such matters. And quite apart from the vegetarian controversy, I do not doubt that the beasts also owe him much. But when we come to positive things (and passions are the only truly positive things) that obstinate doubt remains which remains after all eulogies of Shaw. That fixed fancy sticks to the mind; that Bernard Shaw is a vegetarian more because he dislikes dead beasts than because he likes live ones.|$|E

40|$|Psychiatric {{categories}} in general, and the personality disorders in particular, remain problematic and contested. This is no where <b>more</b> clearly <b>evident</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> {{the case of}} the 'antisocial' and 'histrionic' personality disorders. In part, the problem is related to the observation of differences in gender distribution. Men {{are more likely to be}} diagnosed 'antisocial' than women, and women are more likely to be diagnosed 'histrionic' than men. Confusion results partly from the suspicion that these categories may be culturally conditioned and therefore spurious as medical labels true in some 'absolute' sense. This paper argues that the antisocial and histrionic disorders have cultural histories, representing (in extreme form) values strongly congruent with familiar cultural stereotypes: the 'independent' male and the 'dependent' female. The process by which these values were delegated to men and women is examined, and then shown to be at least partly determinative of later developments in the formation of psychiatric categories. psychiatric classification antisocial and histrionic personality disorders cultural history...|$|R

For this reason, many Web search engines employ information retrieval (IR) techniques other than boolean search.
