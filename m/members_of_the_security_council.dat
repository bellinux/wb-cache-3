5|$|Amending the UN Charter, {{possibly}} {{through a}} Charter Review Conference under Article 109 of the UN Charter, is a commonly cited possibility. This {{is difficult because}} it requires ratification by two-thirds of UN members, including all five permanent <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council.</b> There have been only five amendments to the UN Charter since 1945, {{and none of them}} were done through the Article 109 process. Louis Sohn and Grenville Clark, in their 1958 book World Peace Through World Law, proposed establishing a UN Parliamentary Assembly through this method.|$|E

25|$|Opposition {{groups in}} Syria took a new turn in late 2011, during the Syrian Civil War, as they united {{to form the}} Syrian National Council (SNC), which has {{received}} significant international support and recognition as a partner for dialogue.
