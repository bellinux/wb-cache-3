Particles were examined at three locations in the exhaust system: 1) directly at the hexavalent chromium plating bath surface, 2) at the exit of a cyclone separator located in the exhaust system approximately three to four meters downstream of the bath, and, 3) in the exhaust stack, downstream of the induced draft fan and all abatement devices. Particle diameters at the bath surface ranged from 0. 3 to 25 micrometers. Downstream of the cyclone exit and <b>mesh</b> <b>pad</b> filters, particle top sizes were approximately 5 and 0. 7 micrometers, respectively. On a mass basis, the collection efficiency of all abatement devices was 99. 997 %. Assuming droplets in the flow consist primarily of water and chromium, correcting the total particle mass flow against water content gives a chromium emission rate of 64, 000 µg/hr which compares favorably with a value of 77, 000 µg/hr measured with EPA methods.

40|$|Scrubber design {{practice}} {{today is}} {{largely based on}} experimental data generated at ambient conditions with model fluid system such as air-water. Though good efficiency is often measured in the lab, real natural gas scrubbers often fail to meet the requirements. Mal-functioning scrubbers {{can lead to a}} series of operational and mechanical problems further downstream such as compressor breakdown, fouling, breakdown of gas cleaning processes and off-spec gas quality. Therefore {{one of the most common}} scrubber configurations has been put to the test in three different test rigs –a low-pressure rig, a high-pressure rig and a large scale high-pressure rig at an onshore gas plant. The scrubber configuration consisting of a vane-type inlet, a <b>mesh</b> <b>pad</b> and a bank of axial flow cyclones, has been tested at wide range of operating conditions and fluid properties. For the first time scientific laboratory scrubber measurements have been reported for live hydrocarbon fluids at pressures up to 113 barg. The separation efficiencies and pressure drops have been measured and reported for all tests. In addition some few unique measurements of the droplet size distribution in a high pressure scrubber have been carried out. The results show that the commonly used K-value (Souders-Brown equation) is a good design criterion for conditions where the <b>mesh</b> <b>pad</b> is below flooded condition, while it fails at more compact conditions i. e. K > 0. 15 m/s. In most cases the largest droplets were larger than 400 microns and efficient droplet separation could therefore be expected. Though, droplets formed from condensation at highpressure natural gas where found to be in the size range 1 - 10 microns which is hard to separate under these conditions. The performance degradation of the axial flow cyclone used in this study was totally governed by a general re-entrainment process rather than insufficient separation of small droplets. A new approach to predict cyclone efficiency was therefore needed. By mathematically modelling cyclone geometry, flow and fluid properties a brand new relationship was derived that correlates extraordinary well with separation efficiency –the dimensionless reentrainment number. In general the results showed that the efficiency decreased with increasing pressure. Also, it was seen that the efficiency dropped considerably when a live hydrocarbon fluid system was used instead of a model fluid system where only minor amounts of the gas is dissolved in the liquid phase and vice versa. Also, differences where found between the large scale and the small scale scrubber due to the uneven distribution of the fluids in the scrubber cross section. This work has therefore revealed the importance of carrying out tests with “real fluids”, at relevant pressure and at large scale in order to predict the performance of real natural gas scrubbers...|$|E

The inlet vane was studied at high pressure. The measurements performed at elevated pressures were performed at 20, 50 and 85 bars for a N 2 /Exxsol system {{as well as a}} synthetic natural gas mix. The mesh pads studied varied in height, specific surface area, wire packing density, wire diameter as well as porosity. Liquid holdup measurements were made at five vertical positions and in addition pressure drop and separation efficiency were measured. The results show variations in holdup profile depending on liquid load, pad geometry, running time, measuring position and interfacial properties. Droplet size measurements were also made for all wire mesh pads below and at flooding of the wire mesh pads. A new equation was developed that qualitatively describes aspects of wire <b>mesh</b> <b>pad</b> design and was used for developing correlations. A novel method for measuring flooding point was developed and flooding points for several inlet pipe liquid volume fractions were made. A correlation predicting flooding points in wire mesh pads at both low and high pressure was developed. Dry pressure drop for all wire mesh pads was also determined. A correlation predicting dry pressure drop for spiral wound pads was developed. A novel method for measuring scrubber efficiency above a inlet vane at varying vertical positions was developed. The separation efficiency was measured at five different vertical positions in a scrubber column with an inner diameter of 252 mm. In addition a column of 150 mm was investigated at one position. Liquid fraction measurements were made at two vertical positions to asses flow distribution. Droplet size measurements were also performed 127. 5 mm above the inlet vane.

40|$|Natural gas {{is a vital}} {{component}} of the worlds supply of energy. In Norway all the gas can be found offshore where it needs to processed before transport. A {{vital part of the}} processing is gas and liquid separation. Current gas-liquid separators are big and expensive, and the offshore industry is looking for more compact separators. One of the more prominent technologies is the NNNGLseparator developed at NTNU. To further identify its possibilities, a thorough research program has been startedIn this thesis one-dimensional models describing pressure drop and separation performance of the NTNU Natural Gas Liquid Separator (NNGLseparator) for dispersed gas-liquid flows has been studied. Here modeling of separation performance was divided into cyclonic separation and droplet capture by the meshpad, and then combined in sequence. The droplet capture is assumed to occur before cyclonic separation. To analyze the impact of centrifugal force on droplet capture, the force was included in a previous proposed model describing droplet capture by a single fiber in the meshpad. With this as basis, modeling of total droplet capture for the meshpad was analyzed. Through this analysis we proposed an extension on the existing model for the case of the flow not following the rotation of the meshpad. The droplets that are not captured are then separated through cyclonic separation. To model this separation mechanism, a modified time of flight model was developed. The modification includes the mesh porosity, and a - factor describing the droplet s reduced radial velocity due to the obstructing meshpad. Existing models for pressure drop across fixed porous media were compared to experimental data to identify which model best applies to the meshpad used in the NNGLseparator. How this model performs in describing a rotating porous media was then analyzed for the two scenarios; fully developed flow before mesh entry and developing flow inside a rotating meshpad. Through this analysis an extension to the pressure drop model was proposed, which includes the tangential velocity difference between rotating mesh and gas flow. A previous proposed model for pressure drop across wet <b>mesh</b> <b>pad</b> was reviewed. This led to a discussion on how liquid hold up differs in the NNGLseparator from conventional fixed meshpads. The proposed one-dimensional models were then analyzed through a parametric study of the separator performance in terms of pressure drop and efficiency of droplet separation for different flow conditions and geometries...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Although, the knitted {{wire-mesh}} demisters {{have been}} commonly {{used as a}} low cost device {{for the removal of}} droplets from the gas or vapour streams in the industrial processes such as distillation, absorption and evaporation, the information on their general performance characteristics is rather lacking. The Souders-Brown expression, [formula could not be replicated] developed to estimate the superficial vapour velocity in a fractionating plate column which causes the entrainment of liquid droplets in the vapour stream has been generally accepted to predict the maximum allowable gas rate through the demister for a given duty. The value of K is usually taken to be from 0. 06 to 0. 13 ms - 1. Though the value of K has been suggested to be a function of the geometry of the demister pad, droplet entrainment loads and the physical properties of the gas-liquid system, so far no formal attempt has been made to develop this functional relationship on any theoretical grounds. The primary aim of this study was therefore to investigate the general performance characteristics of the wire-mesh demisters and develop the functional relationship of K to the different variables. This investigation reports the performance characteristics of a demister when operating in air at atmospheric pressure and temperature. The variables considered in this programme of work are: (1) The geometry of the demister.; (2) The velocity of gas at approach to the demister.; (3) The drop size range of the entrained mist.; (4) The liquid entrainment loading in the gas stream.; (5) The wettability of wire surface material and the liquid properties of surface tension and viscosity. The performance characteristics are the resistance to the gas glow, the maximum allowable gas rate and the droplet capture efficiency of a demister. The collection efficiency was measured using a standard stack sampling method. The droplet size distribution at both the upstream and the downstream faces of the demister was measured in-situ using a Malvern Laser droplet sizer. The liquid retained in the <b>mesh</b> <b>pad</b> during the operation has considerable influence on both its flow resistance and efficiency of collection. The load cell method was employed to dynamically measure this liquid holdup. The interactions between the liquid holdup, the pressure gradient, liquid entrainment loading and the gas velocity are of extremely complex nature and hence macroscopic approach has been adopted to explain the maximum allowable gas velocity and flow resistance results. Based on the experimental results and semi-empirical modelling in terms of "flow through tubes" for wet filters, a simple design procedure for wire-mesh demisters has been developed...|$|E

40|$|Gas {{bearings}} in oil-free micro-turbomachinery for {{process gas}} applications and for power generation (< 400 kW) must offer adequate load capacity and thermal stability, reliable rotordynamic performance {{at high speeds}} and temperatures, low power losses and minimal maintenance costs. The metal mesh foil bearing (MMFB) is a promising foil bearing technology offering inexpensive manufacturing cost, large inherent material energy dissipation mechanism, and custom-tailored stiffness and damping properties. This dissertation presents predictions and measurements of the dynamic forced performance of various high speed and high temperature MMFBs. MMFB forced performance depends mainly on its elastic support structure, consisting of arcuate metal <b>mesh</b> <b>pads</b> and a smooth top foil. The analysis models the top foil as a 2 D finite element (FE) shell supported uniformly by a metal mesh under-layer. The solution of the structural FE model coupled with a gas film model, governed by the Reynolds equation, delivers the pressure distribution over the top foil and thus the load reaction. A perturbation analysis further renders the dynamic stiffness and damping coefficients for the bearing. The static and dynamic performance predictions are validated against limited published experimental data. A one-to-one comparison of the static and dynamic forced performance characteristics of a MMFB against a Generation I bump foil bearing (BFB) of similar size, with a slenderness ratio L/D= 1. 04, showcases the comparative performance of MMFB against a commercially available gas foil bearing design. The measurements of rotor lift-off speed and drag friction at start-up and airborne conditions are conducted for rotor speeds up to 70 krpm and under identical specific loads (W/LD = 0. 06 to 0. 26 bar). The dynamic force coefficients of the bearings are estimated, in a ?floating bearing? type test rig, while floating atop a journal spinning to speeds as high as 50 krpm and with controlled static loads (22 N) applied in the vertical direction. The parameter identification is conducted in the frequency range of 200 - 400 Hz first, and then up to 600 Hz using higher load capacity shakers. A finite element rotordynamic program (XLTRC 2) models a hollow rotor and two MMFBs supporting it and predict the synchronous rotor response for known imbalances. The predictions agree well with the ambient temperature rotor response measurements. Extensive rotor response measurements and rotor and bearing temperature measurements, with a coil heater warming up to 200 ?C and placed inside the hollow rotor, reveal the importance of adequate thermal management. The database of high speed high temperature performance measurements {{and the development of}} a predictive tool will aid in the design and deployment of MMFBs in commercial high-speed turbomachinery.
