50|$|The {{organisation}} uses {{many different}} types of vehicles. Some are purpose-built and some have been adapted into new roles such as <b>mobile</b> <b>incident</b> command <b>units.</b> Many of the vehicles have all-terrain capabilities such as Land Rover Defender field ambulances, Bedford and Iveco four-wheel drive lorries and Bandvagn 206 personnel carriers. Standard vehicles such as emergency ambulances and class B fire appliances are also available for use by their respective services. Vehicle livery is generally non-standardised orange and blue on a white background with the exception of Dublin Civil Defence who use fleet-standard orange/blue Battenburg markings over white paintwork on all new vehicles. The Water Rescue Unit have a fleet of inshore patrol vessels and rigid-hulled inflatable boats.|$|R

Self-service systems offers the users {{the benefit of}} 24 / 7 access to an ever-growing range of services and perhaps also {{a strong sense of}} autonomy and fulfillment. Three papers in this section approach the design of the user experience of self-service systems in an integrated way and show the readership of this journal what methods and techniques can be used in this type of design process. These are, 'Identifying User Experience Factors for <b>Mobile</b> <b>Incident</b> Reporting in Urban Contexts,' by Bach, Bernhaupt, and Winckler, 'Improving User Experience for Passenger Information Systems.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the time domain version of the Uniform Asymptotic Physical Optics {{solution}} for the field diffracted by {{the edge of a}} nonpenetrable half-plane characterized by an anisotropic impedance boundary condition. A transient plane wave is assumed obliquely incident on the scatterer in the more general case of principal axes of anisotropy not coincident with the edge. The time domain solution is obtained from the knowledge of the corresponding frequency domain expression in the hypothesis that the impedance tensor components along the principal axes of anisotropy do not depend on the frequency. An inverse Laplace’s transform is used to this end. The response to an <b>incident</b> <b>unit</b> step function plane wave is explicitly considered...|$|R
50|$|PAR as {{described}} with PPF does {{not distinguish between}} different wavelengths between 400 and 700 nm, and assumes that wavelengths outside this range have zero photosynthetic action. If the exact spectrum of the light is known, the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) values in &mu;mol/s can be modified by applying different weighting factor to different wavelengths. This results in a quantity called the yield photon flux (YPF). The red curve in the graph shows that photons around 610 nm (orange-red) have the highest amount of photosynthesis per photon. However, because short-wavelength photons carry more energy per photon, {{the maximum amount of}} photosynthesis per <b>incident</b> <b>unit</b> of energy is at a longer wavelength, around 650 nm (deep red).|$|R
50|$|The Irish {{national}} police force, the Garda Síochána, {{has a number}} of nationwide CBRN response teams. The teams are based regionally (in six regions; Dublin, Eastern, Northern, Southern, South-Eastern & Western) and began operating from 2004 with 100 trained officers (170 responders trained throughout the country as of 2009). There is a requirement for members to be re-certified within 18 months of training. CBRN response teams are trained by the Garda Tactical Training Unit, and supported nationally by the Emergency Response Unit (ERU). Other emergency services also have limited CBRN expertise, such as the Health Service Executive (HSE) and Dublin Fire Brigade (DFB), who have a Hazardous Materials (Haz-Mat) and Chemical <b>Incident</b> <b>Unit.</b>|$|R

40|$|Since the mid 1990 s, fire {{services}} {{across the}} UK {{have begun to}} introduce <b>mobile</b> <b>incident</b> management information systems (known as Vehicle Mounted Data Systems or VMDS) {{with the intention of}} enhancing information to front-line firefighters and modernising the provision of fire services. Drawing on actor-network theory, this paper examines how fire service work is made increasingly mobile and how fire crews respond ambivalently to the implementation of a mobile information system. The paper argues that fire crews’ ambivalence can be connected to a range of organisational uncertainties and practical ambiguities associated with the current and future deployment of the VMDS. This suggests that implementation of mobile devices is not a one-off initiative, but is characterised by ongoing iterations and an uncertain trajectory. From its deployment as a device to provide information ‘anytime and anywhere’ it is concluded that the VMDS has now become {{an important part of the}} future context for UK fire service provision...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose the time domain version of the Uniform Asymptotic Physical Optics {{solution}} for the field diffracted by a junction formed by two thin layers consisting of highly conducting nonmagnetic dielectrics. The incidence direction is assumed to be orthogonal to the junction. The time domain diffracted field is obtained from the knowledge of the corresponding frequency domain expression, which contains the transition function of the Uniform Geometrical Theory of Diffraction, in the hypothesis of resistive sheet having resistivity not depending on the frequency. The Veruttipong's approach is applied by taking advantage from the fact that the corresponding high-frequency solution is given as superposition of the contributions due to each half-plane.
