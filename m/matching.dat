5|$|If a bound {{electron}} {{is in an}} excited state, an interacting photon with the proper energy can cause stimulated emission of a photon with a <b>matching</b> energy level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an energy difference <b>matching</b> {{the energy of the}} interacting photon. The emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with <b>matching</b> phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized. This physical property is used to make lasers, which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency band.|$|E

5|$|The <b>matching</b> rules can be {{described}} in several ways. One approach is to color the vertices (with two colors, e.g., black and white) and require that adjacent tiles have <b>matching</b> vertices. Another is to use a pattern of circular arcs (as shown above left in green and red) to constrain the placement of tiles: when two tiles share an edge in a tiling, the patterns must match at these edges.|$|E
5|$|The <b>matching</b> rules {{distinguish}} {{sides of}} the tiles, and entail that tiles may be juxtaposed in certain particular ways but not in others. Two ways to describe these <b>matching</b> rules are shown in {{the image on the}} right. In one form, tiles must be assembled such that the curves on the faces match in color and position across an edge. In the other, tiles must be assembled such that the bumps on their edges fit together.|$|E

25|$|A perfect <b>matching</b> (a.k.a. 1-factor) is a <b>matching</b> which matches all {{vertices}} of {{the graph}}. That is, every vertex of the graph is incident to exactly one {{edge of the}} <b>matching.</b> Figure (b) above {{is an example of}} a perfect <b>matching.</b> Every perfect <b>matching</b> is maximum and hence maximal. In some literature, the term complete <b>matching</b> is used. In the above figure, only part (b) shows a perfect <b>matching.</b> A perfect <b>matching</b> is also a minimum-size edge cover.

25|$|A <b>matching</b> in a graph is {{a subset}} of its edges, no two of which share an endpoint. Polynomial time {{algorithms}} are known for many algorithmic problems on matchings, including maximum <b>matching</b> (finding a <b>matching</b> that uses as many edges as possible), maximum weight <b>matching,</b> and stable marriage. In many cases, <b>matching</b> problems are simpler to solve on bipartite graphs than on non-bipartite graphs, and many <b>matching</b> algorithms such as the Hopcroft–Karp algorithm for maximum cardinality <b>matching</b> algorithm for maximum matchings in bipartite graphs|journal=SIAM Journal on Computing|volume=2|issue=4|pages=225–231|year=1973|doi=10.1137/0202019}}. work correctly only on bipartite inputs.|$|E
25|$|In {{constructing}} matchings in undirected graphs, it {{is important}} to find alternating paths, paths of vertices that start and end at unmatched vertices, in which the edges at odd positions in the path are not part of a given partial <b>matching</b> and in which the edges at even positions in the path are part of the <b>matching.</b> By removing the matched edges of such a path from a <b>matching,</b> and adding the unmatched edges, one can increase the size of the <b>matching.</b> Similarly, cycles that alternate between matched and unmatched edges are of importance in weighted <b>matching</b> problems.|$|E
