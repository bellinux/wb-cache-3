2500|$|The church {{holds that}} faith and {{salvation}} {{may only be}} obtained by hearing the preaching of its ministers (typically called workers), and by observing their sacrificial lives. During the early years, this requirement {{was referred to as}} the [...] "Living Witness Doctrine," [...] though that term is no longer used. The minister must be heard and observed in person, rather than by broadcasts, recordings, books or tracts, or other indirect communication. The church's ministerial structure is based on Jesus' instructions to his apostles found in Matthew [...] (with similar passages in [...] and in [...] ). The church's view is that, following these Biblical examples, its ministers have no permanent dwelling places, minister in pairs, sell all and go out with only minimal worldly possessions, and rely only upon hospitality and generosity. Most ministers receive their support and income directly from lay members, and have no fixed address except for <b>mail</b> <b>collection.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Unlike Canadian mailboxes, {{which were}} painted red, U.S. <b>mail</b> <b>collection</b> boxes were {{originally}} painted in red or green. Beginning in 1909, all <b>mail</b> <b>collection</b> boxes were painted {{a dark green}} to avoid confusion with emergency and fire equipment. [...] Dark green gave way to olive drab green after World War I, when the U.S. Army donated a large supply of olive drab green paint to the Post Office. Olive drab green subsequently became the standard color for all U.S. <b>mail</b> <b>collection</b> boxes until 1955. On 4 July 1955, Postmaster General Arthur Summerfield announced that the Post Office would begin painting all <b>mail</b> <b>collection</b> boxes in red, white, and blue to make them easily identifiable. Subsequently, the Post Office began painting <b>mail</b> <b>collection</b> boxes in red and blue, with white lettering. In 1971 the Post Office (now USPS) changed <b>mail</b> <b>collection</b> boxes to the current USPS Dark Blue with contrasting lettering. The coming of the automobile also influenced U.S. mailbox design, and in the late 1930s, an extension chute or [...] "snorkel" [...] to drive-up curbside collection boxes was adopted.|$|E
