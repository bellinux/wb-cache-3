There is now growing evidence that the converse is also true, that the immune system shapes the composition of the intestinal microbiome. During conditions of health, this bidirectional interaction achieves a homeostasis in which inappropriate immune responses to non-pathogenic microbes are averted and immune activity suppresses blooms of potentially pathogenic microbes (pathobionts). Genetic alteration in immune/epithelial function can affect host gardening of the intestinal microbiome, contributing to the diversity of intestinal microbiota within a population and in some cases allowing for unfavorable <b>microbial</b> <b>ecologies</b> (dysbiosis) that confer disease susceptibility...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to determine the influence closed <b>microbial</b> <b>ecologies</b> have on modification or simplification of natural intestinal flora of ferrets in a closed environmental system. On the basis of previous tests in which certain species (Salmonella and Bacteroides) were decreased at 90 days of enclosure, a second trial was constructed for 180 -day tests. In this trial there was little difference in the 8 major classes of intestinal flora between animals in the Open and Closed environmental groups except for the level of Lactobacillus. It is of extreme importance to note that when both Open and Closed groups contracted hemorrhagic gastritis, the interrelationship of this agent with other intestinal flora produced a more profound effect on animals from the Closed Group, particularly with reference to Lactobacillus levels...|$|R

25|$|As {{its name}} suggests, geobiology {{is closely related}} to many other fields of study, and does not have clearly defined {{boundaries}} or perfect agreement on what exactly they comprise. Some practitioners take a very broad view of its boundaries, encompassing many older, more established fields such as biogeochemistry, paleontology, and <b>microbial</b> <b>ecology.</b> Others take a more narrow view, assigning it to emerging research that falls between these existing fields, such as with geomicrobiology. The following list includes both those that are clearly a part of geobiology, e.g. geomicrobiology, as well as those that share scientific interests but have not historically been considered a sub-discipline of geobiology, e.g. paleontology.|$|E

It encompasses several fields that are of direct relevance to geobiology, and the tools of microbiology all pertain to geobiology. Environmental microbiology is especially entangled in geobiology since it seeks an understanding of the actual organisms and processes that are relevant in nature, as opposed to the traditional lab-based approach to microbiology. <b>Microbial</b> <b>ecology</b> is similar, but tend to focus more on lab studies and the relationships between organisms within a community, as well as within the ecosystem of their chemical and geological physical environment.

30|$|The {{bacteria}} in the oral environment are well studied, accessible, and similar to many other naturally occurring <b>microbial</b> <b>ecologies</b> in that they typically incorporate many different strains and phenotypes in dynamic competition for limited nutrients (Biswas and Biswas 2011; Marsh 2004, 2005; Gibbons and Houte 1975; Kuramitsu et al. 2007; Cvitkovitch et al. 2003; Kolenbrander 2000; Scannapieco 1994; Liljemark and Bloomquist 1996; Loesche 1986; Salli and Ouwehand 2015). Streptococcus mutans has been widely studied as a model organism that produces cultures representative of dental plaque and illustrative of processes contributing to dental decay (Hamada and Slade 1980; Pallanza et al. 1984; Loesche 1986; Scannapieco 1994; Liljemark and Bloomquist 1996; Wilson 1996; Kolenbrander 2000; Bhattacharya et al. 2003; Cvitkovitch et al. 2003; Xiao et al. 2008; Biswas and Biswas 2011; Cornejo et al. 2013; Kitagawa et al. 2014; Salli and Ouwehand 2015).|$|R
30|$|Bacteria in {{the mouth}} thrive in a very dynamic environment, and {{attempts}} to manage dental health must consider the planktonic bacteria present in saliva, mature biofilms already adherent to tooth and epithelial surfaces, {{as well as the}} transitional processes of biofilm formation (e.g., following dental cleaning) and dispersal. Further, these various stages of bacterial growth may exhibit different susceptibilities to treatment with antimicrobial compounds. This is a common characteristic of <b>microbial</b> <b>ecologies,</b> complicating determination and reporting of antimicrobial activity (Marsh 2004; Harrison et al. 2004; Sabater et al. 2007; Salli and Ouwehand 2015). The use of automation in the current investigation facilitated side-by-side comparison of three distinct phenotypes (i.e., planktonic, biofilm forming, and 24  h biofilm cultures) by significantly improving experimental throughput as compared to manual operation (Fig.  4). Directly compared side-by-side, the sensitivity of biofilm forming cultures to CPC antimicrobial activity was much greater than 24  h biofilm cultures and even slightly greater than planktonic cultures.|$|R

500|$|Metagenomics is {{the study}} of genetic {{material}} recovered directly from environmental samples. The broad field may also be referred to as environmental genomics, ecogenomics or community genomics. While traditional microbiology and microbial genome sequencing and genomics rely upon cultivated clonal cultures, early environmental gene sequencing cloned specific genes (often the 16S rRNA gene) to produce a profile of diversity in a natural sample. Such work revealed {{that the vast majority of}} microbial biodiversity had been missed by cultivation-based methods. Recent studies use either [...] "shotgun" [...] or PCR directed sequencing to get largely unbiased samples of all genes from all the members of the sampled communities. Because of its ability to reveal the previously hidden diversity of microscopic life, metagenomics offers a powerful lens for viewing the microbial world that has the potential to revolutionize understanding of the entire living world.

40|$|Putative microbialites are {{commonly}} regarded to have formed {{in association with}} photosynthetic microorganisms, such as cyanobacteria. However, many modern microbial mat ecosystems are dominated by chemotrophic bacteria and archaea. Like phototrophs, filamentous sulfur-oxidizing bacteria form large mats at the sediment/water interface that can act to stabilize sediments, and their metabolic activities may mediate the formation of marine phosphorites. Similarly, bacteria and archaea associated with the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) catalyze the precipitation of seafloor authigenic carbonates. When preserved, lipid biomarkers, isotopic signatures, body fossils, and lithological indicators of the local depositional environment {{may be used to}} identify chemotrophic mats in the rock record. The recognition of chemotrophic communities in the rock record has the potential to transform our understanding of ancient <b>microbial</b> <b>ecologies,</b> evolution, and geochemical conditions.

40|$|Statistical {{fluctuations}} in population sizes of microbes {{may be quite}} large depending {{on the nature of}} their underlying stochastic dynamics. For example, the variance of the population size of a microbe undergoing a pure birth process with unlimited resources is proportional to the square of its mean. We refer to such large fluctuations, with the variance growing as square of the mean, as Giant Number Fluctuations (GNF). Luria and Delbruck showed that spontaneous mutation processes in microbial populations exhibit GNF. We explore whether GNF can arise in other <b>microbial</b> <b>ecologies.</b> We study certain simple ecological models evolving via stochastic processes: (i) bi-directional mutation, (ii) lysis-lysogeny of bacteria by bacteriophage, and (iii) horizontal gene transfer (HGT). For the case of bi-directional mutation process, we show analytically exactly that the GNF relationship holds at large times. For the ecological model of bacteria undergoing lysis or lysogeny under viral infection, we show that if the viral population can be experimentally manipulated to stay quasi-stationary, the process of lysogeny maps essentially to one-way mutation process and hence the GNF property of the lysogens follows. Finally, we show that even the process of HGT may map to the mutation process at large times, and thereby exhibits GNF. Comment: 18 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
