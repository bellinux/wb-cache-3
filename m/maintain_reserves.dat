In addition, the per-ship costs for the reactivation and updates (that were determined feasible) would be close to the costs for an Iowa, for a much less capable ship.

40|$|Reserve {{requirements}} {{has been}} part of the monetary policy instruments of banking in many countries including member countries of European Monetary Union and Czech Republic, too. But <b>maintaining</b> <b>reserve</b> requiremnts needs a contemporary rationale, no matter what their original purposes may have been. The obvious reasons to <b>maintain</b> <b>reserve</b> requiremets are to regulate bank liquidity, to conduct monetary policy (regulation of the money multiplier or short-term interest rates) and to pay the special "tax" to the state budget. This article deals especially with the third reason but the liquidity and monetary policy are also discussed. All three rationales seems not to be equivalent to the burden of the reserve requirements on the banking system and to the distorting effects on financial markets. Only in the countries with very limited possibilities to conduct monetary policy by means of other instruments, especially of daily open market operations, there may be <b>maintaining</b> of <b>reserve</b> requirements reasonable. There are two main approaches to removing the burden of reserve requirements and making the banks more competitive to other financial institutions - to eliminate reserve requirements altogether or to pay interest rate on them.

40|$|Due to an {{increasing}} amount of wind turbines {{in the power}} system, which have a volatile power output, the need for flexibility increases. This flexibility {{can be obtained by}} ancillary services. Therefore, the provision of ancillary services with wind turbines is gaining interest. As they currently do not participate in the frequency control, this might compromise the proper functioning of the power system. The modern turbines are equipped with a power-electronic converter, so they can be used to provide a variety of ancillary services when the appropriate control strategies are used. In this paper, the provision of active power reserves for frequency control is considered. Three state-of-the-art power control strategies, i. e., constant power control, linear slope control and percentage control are compared to determine their ability to <b>maintain</b> <b>reserves.</b> It is concluded that all the strategies are able to provide reserves, but linear slope control and percentage control perform the best, especially when the wind turbines are aggregated in wind farms...|$|E

40|$|The {{market for}} the most liquid of money market instruments-Federal funds-evolved as borrowers and lenders sought to exploit {{opportunities}} through trading in reserve deposit funds. Trading in Federal funds began in the 1920 s and involved only a few Federal Reserve member banks located in New York City. Today, the market includes over 14, 000 com-mercial banks and {{a wide range of}} nonbank financial institutions. 1 The characteristics of Federal funds as well as the mechanics of their purchase and sale reflect the needs of today’s market participants. What Are Federal Funds? ” Federal funds are short-term loans of immediately available funds, i. e., funds that can be transferred or withdrawn during one business day. Such immediately available funds include deposits at Federal Reserve Banks and col-lected liabilities of commercial banks and other de-pository institutions. Federal funds are exempt from reserve requirements and the vast majority are un-secured. Most Federal funds are “overnight money”-funds lent out on one day and repaid the following morning. Loans of longer maturity, known as term Federal funds are not uncommon, however. The law requires, for purposes of monetary con-trol, that all depository institutions <b>maintain</b> <b>reserves</b> as prescribed by the Federal Reserve System. Fed-eral Reserve Regulation D delineates specific classes of liabilities which are subject to Federal Reserve requirements. Commercial banks, thrift institutions; U. S. branches and agencies of foreign banks, and Edge Act corporations must hold set percentages of these liabilities in a combination of vault cash and noninterest-earning reserve balances at a Federal Reserve Bank.

40|$|This study {{contributes}} {{to the understanding of}} the contribution of financial reserves to sustaining nonprofit organisations. Recognising the limited recent Australian research in the area of nonprofit financial vulnerability, it specifically examines financial reserves held by signatories to the Code of Conduct of the Australian Council for International Development (ACFID) for the years 2006 to 2010. As this period includes the Global Financial Crisis, it presents a unique opportunity to observe the role of savings in a period of heightened financial threats to sustainability. The need for nonprofit entities to <b>maintain</b> <b>reserves,</b> while appearing intuitively evident, is neither unanimously accepted nor supported by established theoretic constructs. Some early frameworks attempt to explain the savings behaviour of nonprofit organisations and its role in organisational sustainability. Where researchers have considered the issue, its treatment has usually been either purely descriptive or alternatively, peripheral to a broader attempt to predict financial vulnerability. Given the importance of nonprofit entities to civil society, the sustainability of these organisations during times of economic contraction, such as the recent Global Financial Crisis, is a significant issue. Widespread failure of nonprofits, or even the perception of failure, will directly affect, not only those individuals who access their public goods and services, but would also have impacts on public confidence in both government and the sectors’ ability to manage and achieve their purpose. This study attempts to ‘shine a light’ on the paradox inherent in considering nonprofit savings. On the one hand, a public prevailing view is that nonprofit organisations should not hoard and indeed, should spend all of their funds on the direct achievement of their purposes. Against this, is the commonsense need for a financial buffer if only to allow for the day to day contingencies of pay rises and cost increases. At the entity level, the extent of reserves accumulated (or not) is an important consideration for Management Boards. The general public are also interested in knowing the level of funds held by nonprofits as a measure of both their commitment to purpose and as an indicator of their effectiveness. There is a need to communicate the level and prevalence of reserve holdings, balancing the prudent hedging of uncertainty against a sense of resource hoarding in the mind of donors. Finally, funders (especially governments) are interested in knowing the appropriate level of reserves to facilitate the ongoing sustainability of the sector. This is particularly so where organisations are involved in the provision of essential public goods and services. At a scholarly level, the study seeks to provide a rationale for this behaviour within the context of appropriate theory. At a practical level, the study seeks to give an indication of the drivers for savings, the actual levels of reserves held within the sector studied, as well as an indication as to whether the presence of reserves did mitigate the effects of financial turmoil during the Global Financial Crisis. The argument is not whether there is a need to ensure sustainability of nonprofits, but rather how it is to be done and whether the holding of reserves (net assets) is an essential element is achieving this. While the study offers no simple answers, it does appear that the organisations studied present as two groups, the ‘savers’ who build reserves and keep ‘money in the bank’ and ‘spender-delivers’ who put their resources ‘on the ground’. To progress an understanding of this dichotomy, the study suggests a need to move from its current approach to one which needs to more closely explore accounts based empirical donor attitude and nonprofit Management Board strategy...|$|E
