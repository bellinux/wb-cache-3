40|$|The lesser <b>mulberry</b> <b>pyralid,</b> Glyphodes pyloalis Walker (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is a {{monophagous}} {{and dangerous}} pest of mulberry {{that has been}} recently observed in Guilan province, northern Iran. In this study, the crude methanol extract of sweet wormwood Artemisia annua L. (Asterales: Asteracaea) was investigated on toxicity, biological and physiological characteristics of this pest under controlled conditions (24 ± 1 °C, 75 ± 5 % RH, and 16 : 8 L:D photoperiod). The effect of acute toxicity and sublethal doses on physiological characteristics was performed by topical application. The LC 50 and LC 20 values on fourth instar larvae were calculated as 0. 33 and 0. 22 gram leaf equivalent/ mL, respectively. The larval duration of fifth instar larvae in LC 50 treatment was prolonged (5. 8 ± 0. 52 days) compared with the control group (4. 26 ± 0. 29 days). However larval duration was reduced in the LC 20 treatment. The female adult longevity in the LC 50 dose was the least (4. 53 ± 0. 3 days), while longevity among controls was the highest (9. 2 ± 0. 29 days). The mean fecundity of adults after larval treatment with LC 50 was recorded as 105. 6 ± 16. 84 eggs/female, while the control was 392. 74 ± 22. 52 eggs/female. The percent hatchability was reduced in all treatments compared with the control. The effect of extract in 0. 107, 0. 053, 0. 026 and 0. 013 gle/mL on biochemical characteristics of this pest was also studied. The activity of α-amylase and protease 48 hours post—treatment was significantly reduced compared with the control. Similarly lipase, esterase, and glutathione S-transferase activity were significantly affected by A. annua extract...|$|E
