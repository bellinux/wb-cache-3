5000|$|Although the <b>marsh</b> <b>woundwort</b> {{has little}} fragrance, {{it is very}} {{attractive}} to bumblebees. Nectar indicators guide the insect to probe into {{the centre of the}} flower and the anthers of the stamens and the pistils are correctly located for the insect to transfer pollen between flowers. The seeds of this plant disperse well, the dry fruit capsules float away and this probably why the plant is frequently found on the banks of lakes and other bodies of water. It also spreads vegetatively by means of hollow tuberous root which can throw up shoots far from the original plant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Marsh</b> <b>woundwort</b> is a {{perennial}} plant growing from a horizontal tuberous runner. It has square stems with opposite pairs of leaves {{that are almost}} stalkless, linearly lanceolate, slightly cordate at the base and toothed. The calyx has five sharply-pointed lobes. The purplish-red flowers are in terminal spikes, with gaps in {{the lower part of}} the spike. They are arranged in whorls, each flower consisting of five fused petals, the corolla being two-lipped, the upper lip being gently hooded and the lower lip flat and three-lobed. The flowers are mostly visited by bumblebees. There are four stamens, two long and two short and the fruit is a dry four-chambered schizocarp.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to study the {{geographical}} distribution and historical patterns of use of a little known root crop native to Europe-marsh woundwort Stachys palustris L. The species grows in wet grasslands and arable fields. It produces edible tubers. Both ethnographic literature and archival sources were searched. Seventeen reliable references concerning the consumption of S. palustris in southern and south-eastern Poland were found. The tubers were usually dried and powdered, and then added to soups or to bread dough. They were also eaten as raw snacks. The plant was used mainly during food shortages in spring, until the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth century, and later only as an occasional raw snack until the 1970 s. <b>Marsh</b> <b>woundwort</b> was also eaten in western Ukraine (one reference). There are many references to the edibility of <b>marsh</b> <b>woundwort</b> in the eighteenth and nineteenth century European economic botany literature, particularly in Sweden and Great Britain. These publications tried to popularize the use of S. palustris as food. However, there is no firm evidence from these countries that <b>marsh</b> <b>woundwort</b> was used as food there. <b>Marsh</b> <b>woundwort</b> was also used, throughout northern and central Europe, as pig fodder and as a medicinal plant, particularly for healing wounds. Further studies on the nutritive value of this forgotten crop should be undertaken, particularly that there is little knowledge of the chemical composition of both <b>marsh</b> <b>woundwort</b> and its Asian relative Stachys affinis widely cultivated in China as a vegetable...|$|E
40|$|Stachys palustris, {{well-known}} as <b>marsh</b> <b>woundwort,</b> is {{a perennial}} herb growing in wet environments of Europe. Its tubers, leaves and seeds are eaten raw or cooked. Alike other Stachys species, {{the plant is}} also used as a traditional remedy. Despite S. palustris has been consumed for centuries, {{little is known about}} its chemical constituents. In this work the main secondary metabolites of S. palustris from Hungary and France have been analysed. From the plant ethanolic extracts, ethanoid glucosides, isoscutellarein derivatives, caffeoyl-quinic acids and iridoids have been isolated and structurally characterized by NMR. The essential oils were analysed by GC/MS and showed (E) -phytol, fatty acids and carbonylic compounds as the most abundant compounds. The radical scavenging capacity of plant ethanolic extracts, as evaluated by the DPPH assay, was noteworthy, with IC 50 values of 92. 08 – 105. 42 lg/ml...|$|E
40|$|The {{changes of}} {{phytosanitary}} situation recently {{taking place in}} sugar beet crops in the Republic of Belarus are shown. It is noticed that in the crop agrocoenosises {{there is a high}} infestation level caused by Japanese barnyard millet (Echinochloa crus-galli (L) Pal. Beauv), field sowthistle (Sonchus arvensis L), chickweed (Stellaria media (L) Vill), quick grass (Agropyron repens (L) Pal Beauv), matricary (Matricaria perforate Merat), creeping thistle (Circium arvense (L) scop), <b>marsh</b> <b>woundwort</b> (Stachus palustris L) wild buckwheat (Polygonum convolvulus L), bristle stem hemp nettle (Galeopsis tetrahit L), common horsetail (Equisetum arvense L), field forget-me-not (Myosotis arvensis (L) Hill), shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris (L) Med) etc. Due to non-observance of preventive and separate agrotechnical techniques especially in spring-summer period, such weeds as bedstraw (Galium aparine L), white campion (Melandrium album (Mill) Garcke), green amaranthus (Amaranthus retroflexus L) started to appear in the crops. To protect sugar beet effectively, two variants of herbicides application are proposed. The first one - a combined, one stipulating soil action herbicides application before planting or before sugar beet seedlings emergence and on seedlings - to carry out two treatment by post-emergence preparations. The second variant, a split post- -emergence herbicide application (two-three times spraying) on growing weeds at small application rates. In the next 5 - 6 years, a combined method will be of a primary importance in the conditions of the Republic...|$|E
40|$|Summary 	Organic farming means {{a chance}} for plants to reveal their abilities. We offer better {{conditions}} to the associated plants for their growth and reproduction by no use of chemical herbicides and by using alternative growing methods. 	Organic agrophytocoenoses are significant by higher species richness and cover. There can be found some of endangered species among the weeds, which may be more successful in organic system, therfore the organic type of farming may serve for their protection. The most successful weed species endanger cultural crops on both organic and conventional fields. They become more dangerous {{without the possibility of}} herbicide application. Thanks to this, the strategy of each plant species is more important. That is why the question of weed suppression in organic farming is highly important and frequently asked. 	The aim of this thesis is to analyse weed flora on organic cereals fields and to point out possible factors influencing them. Braun-Blanquet scale of dominance and abundance has been used for the assessment of weed communities. Several different localities were investigated in Benešov district. Influence of winter cereals, spring cereals, previous crop and the tillage system have been assessed. 	Some of the most important weed species were: annual winter weed species in winter cereals, perennials and few annual spring species in spring cereals. Annual weeds were typical for spring cereals sown two years on a one plot, perennials were associated with spring cereals sown after fodder crops. -There were not found any evident differences in weed spectrum in winter cereals based on previous crop. Agrophytocoenosis on fields with conventional and reduced tillage differed. Wider spectrum of perennial species was typical for fields where reduced tillage was applied, differences in annual weed spectrum were also found. Typical species for conventional tillage were for example: <b>marsh</b> <b>woundwort,</b> common couch-grass and common poppy, while, creeping thistle, creeping buttercup, perennial sow-thistle, mugwort, corn chamomile, loose silky-bent and some others were often found on fields where reduced tillage were used. 	The results of the analysis in this thesis mostly lead to the same description of weeds as in literature, but few of the results are different. Thanks to statistically decisive results, it is apparent, how a farmer can affect the plant associations over a long period. Key words: organic farming, weeds, agrophytocoenosis, cereals, weed control, features(characteristic) of weeds...|$|E
