5|$|During the Roman {{occupation}} of the British Isles, a large wool processing factory was established in Winchester, England in about 50 AD. By 1000 AD, England and Spain were recognized as the twin centers of sheep production in the Western world. As the original breeders of the fine-wooled <b>merino</b> <b>sheep</b> that have historically dominated the wool trade, the Spanish gained great wealth. Wool money largely financed Spanish rulers and thus the voyages to the New World by conquistadors. The powerful Mesta (its full title was Honrado Concejo de la Mesta, the Honorable Council of the Mesta) was a corporation of sheep owners mostly drawn from Spain's wealthy merchants, Catholic clergy and nobility that controlled the merino flocks. By the 17th century, the Mesta held upwards of two million head of <b>merino</b> <b>sheep.</b>|$|E
5|$|Much of the dryland {{areas of}} the Riverina contain large sheep stations, {{producing}} medium class wool. The Peppin <b>Merino</b> <b>sheep</b> was first bred {{in the area around}} Wanganella. As many as 70 percent of today’s Australian Merinos are said to be directly descended from the Peppin-developed sheep. The Riverina is home to many Merino studs and the saltbush plains are regarded as one of Australia's best wool growing regions.|$|E
5|$|Breeds {{are often}} {{categorized}} by {{the type of}} their wool. Fine wool breeds are those that have wool of great crimp and density, which are preferred for textiles. Most of these were derived from <b>Merino</b> <b>sheep,</b> and the breed continues to dominate the world sheep industry. Downs breeds have wool between the extremes, and are typically fast-growing meat and ram breeds with dark faces. Some major medium wool breeds, such as the Corriedale, are dual-purpose crosses of long and fine-wooled breeds and were created for high-production commercial flocks. Long wool breeds are the largest of sheep, with long wool and a slow rate of growth. Long wool sheep are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types. For example: the American Columbia breed was developed by crossing Lincoln rams (a long wool breed) with fine-wooled Rambouillet ewes.|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} carried on 1425 ewes Transilvanian <b>Merinos</b> <b>sheep</b> {{in the farm}} {{belonging}} to SC Sinnagro SA, Timis country, regarding the reproduction during breeding season and in extra- season. The investigation revealed that these sheep held in good condition do express estrus (88 %) during spring-summer (May-June) and are lambing during autumn (82 %) with a lower prolificacy (109 %). During fall, almost all sheep (98 %) displayed estrus, lambing in a proportion of 94, 8 %, with a prolificacy of 127, 1 %. The statistical analysis emphasized that all reproductive indexes are higher (p< 0. 01) subsequent to breeding during normal season, compared to the extra-season, excepting fertility.

25|$|In Chiapas, {{personnel}} from the Universidad Autónoma de Chiapas have been investigating a Spanish cheese called La Serena, {{which is made}} in the region of Extremadura with the aim of creating a certified version of it in Mexico. This includes the importation and raising of <b>Merino</b> <b>sheep,</b> as well as learning the methods behind this cheese. The reason behind the effort is that large parts of the state have a similar climate to Extremadura, making the raising of this sheep possible. Researchers have found they can not only reproduce La Serena cheese, but produce a number of other varieties, as well. Despite their ability to produce milk for cheese, most sheep in Mexico are raised for wool and meat. This strain of <b>Merino</b> <b>sheep</b> has been bred for milk production.|$|E
25|$|The {{resistance}} of plain-bodied <b>Merino</b> <b>sheep</b> to flystrike arose from field investigations by Australian scientists, Drs H.R. Seddon and H.B. Belschner, {{in the early}} 1930s. Non-mulesed Merino ewe bodies were graded as plain (A class), wrinkly (B class) and very wrinkly (C class). The plain-bodied (A class) Merino ewes were much less susceptible to flystrike than wrinkly-bodied Merinos (B and C class).|$|E
25|$|In 1796 {{two ships}} were {{dispatched}} to the Dutch Cape Colony by Governor Hunter from Sydney to obtain supplies for the colony. The two commanders, being friends of Macarthur, were requested by him to procure any good sheep which they could buy. By a happy coincidence the two captains were able to execute Macarthur's commission far better than he had hoped. The King of Spain had presented to the Dutch Government {{some of the finest}} pure <b>merino</b> <b>sheep</b> from the jealously guarded Escurial flocks, once owned by King Philip II. These sheep were sent to the Dutch Cape Colony under the care of a Scottish gentleman, who died shortly afterwards. His widow had endless disputes with the Dutch Government, and, to end dissension, the sheep were ordered to be sold. A number of them were purchased by the captains and were duly delivered to Macarthur, The <b>merino</b> <b>sheep,</b> including three rams, were bought by several landowners, including Samuel Marsden.|$|E
5|$|Exportation of merinos without royal {{permission}} {{was also}} a punishable offense, thus ensuring a near-absolute monopoly on the breed until the mid-18th century. After {{the breaking of the}} export ban, fine wool sheep began to be distributed worldwide. The export to Rambouillet by Louis XVI in 1786 formed the basis for the modern Rambouillet (or French Merino) breed. After the Napoleonic Wars and the global distribution of the once-exclusive Spanish stocks of <b>Merinos,</b> <b>sheep</b> raising in Spain reverted to hardy coarse-wooled breeds such as the Churra, and was no longer of international economic significance.|$|R

25|$|There {{were nearly}} 2 million sheep in Australia by 1830, and by 1836, Australia {{had won the}} wool trade war with Germany, mainly because of Germany's preoccupation with fineness. German {{manufacturers}} commenced importing Australian wool in 1845. In 1841, at Mount Crawford in South Australia, Murray established a flock of Camden-blood ewes mated to Tasmanian rams. To broaden the wool and give the animals some size, it is thought some English Leicester blood was introduced. The resultant sheep were the foundation of many South Australian strong wool studs. His brother Alexander Borthwick Murray was also a highly successful breeder of <b>Merino</b> <b>sheep.</b>|$|E
25|$|From 1765, the Germans in Saxony {{crossed the}} Spanish Merino with the Saxon sheep {{to develop a}} dense, fine type of Merino (spinning count between 70s and 80s) adapted to its new environment.

25|$|Sheep farming {{introduced}} in the late 19th century has been a principal economic activity. After reaching its heights during the First World War, the decline in world wool prices affected sheep farming in Argentina. Nowadays about half of Argentina's 15 million sheep are in Patagonia, a percentage that is growing as sheep farming disappears in the Pampa (to the North). Chubut (mainly Merino) is the top wool producer with Santa Cruz (Corriedale and some <b>Merino)</b> second. <b>Sheep</b> farming revived in 2002 with the devaluation of the peso and firmer global demand for wool (led by China and the EU). Still there is little investment in new abbatoirs (mainly in Comodoro Rivadavia, Trelew and Rio Gallegos), and often there are phytosanitary restrictions to the export of sheep meat. Extensive valleys in the Cordilleran range have provided sufficient grazing lands, and the low humidity and weather of the southern region make raising <b>Merino</b> and Corriedale <b>sheep</b> common.|$|R
50|$|In 1811, highly {{decorated}} Nake, {{one of the}} key {{persons of}} Saxony's world famous sheep breeding at that time, established a private farm in the Vorwerk in Kleindrebnitz.

25|$|Black-backed jackals are {{the most}} {{significant}} sheep predators of southern and eastern Africa. Jackal predation typically peaks during droughts when wild food is scarce and the sheep are weakened. <b>Merino</b> <b>sheep</b> {{tend to be the}} most vulnerable, due to their habit of scattering upon attack, unlike fat-tailed sheep which bunch together for defence. In Transvaal between 1965 and 1971, a study on the stomach contents of over 400 jackals showed that sheep constituted 6% of the diet of jackals living in game reserves, and 27% for those living near farming districts. A similar study in Natal revealed that sheep constituted 35% of the resident jackal's diet.|$|E
