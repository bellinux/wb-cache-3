25|$|<b>Mudflaps</b> are now rarely {{specified}} {{as standard}} on production cars as they {{interfere with the}} clean airflow around the vehicle. For larger vehicles such as trucks, mud flaps are still important for their control of spray, and in 2010 {{a new version of}} the mud flap was introduced that has been shown to create significantly less aerodynamic drag than standard mud flaps.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time as Toyota's Camry upgrade in April 1994, Apollo {{specifications}} were also uprated slightly. SLXs now had a four- and GSs a six-speaker stereo system, up from two and four, respectively. The SLX also received a tachometer and rear <b>mudflaps,</b> while the GS variant gained standard fitment cruise control and power windows. A second update in June 1994 fitted a driver's airbag as standard on all models bar the four-cylinder SLX.|$|E
2500|$|The mid 1979 {{changes for}} the 1980 model year US version were mostly cosmetic. The {{interior}} received a redesigned center console and a digital quartz clock. On the exterior were redesigned side view mirrors and 14x5" [...] aluminum wheels were standard (the previous year had steel wheels with plastic wheel covers standard and the aluminum wheels were optional). In addition, body molded <b>mudflaps</b> became available. On the copper metallic and white cars, the <b>mudflaps</b> were painted the body color while the <b>mudflaps</b> were left black on all other colors. On {{the rear of the}} <b>mudflaps,</b> the word [...] "Celica" [...] was painted in white lettering.|$|E

50|$|Skids, who {{originally}} transforms into half of {{an ice cream}} truck, fails to capture Sideways in Shanghai, China. When he and <b>Mudflap</b> return to the NEST base on Diego Garcia, they scan two Chevrolet concept cars for their new modes. Skids takes the green one after knocking <b>Mudflap</b> off it; <b>Mudflap</b> ends up taking {{the form of the}} red-orange one. They then approach and accompany Bumblebee who rescues Sam Witwicky from Megatron and Starscream. <b>Mudflap</b> and Skids then accompany Wheelie, Sam Witwicky and friends and in their search for the ancient Seeker Jetfire and is teleported with them to Egypt. Finding themselves at a dead end, Skids's brawl with <b>Mudflap</b> unintentionally causes them to find the Tomb of the Primes before Bumblebee tosses them out. The twins then accompany Simmons and Leo into devising a plan to destroy the Sun Harvester. They encounter Devastator, in which <b>Mudflap</b> is sucked in by Devastator's vortex grinder with Skids devastated. When <b>Mudflap</b> breaks out of Devastator, he and <b>Mudflap</b> wail on the giant, before getting knocked off. The two are briefly seen taking cover under Devastator and are not seen afterwards.|$|R
50|$|In the cartoon, <b>Mudflap</b> was {{originally}} {{one of the}} Autobot civilian refugees hiding on Earth. Disgruntled with having to exist in secret amongst the lowly human race and stopping at traffic lights, <b>Mudflap</b> was sought out and recruited to join the Decepticons by Starscream, but then he left and wandered Earth. Eventually <b>Mudflap</b> rejoins the Autobots.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the inside}} of the car there were {{virtually}} no changes, but changes to the exterior included a switch to a power mast antenna, <b>mudflaps</b> on all models, and the addition of headlight washers on P-types. All B-pillar and nose badges for cars sold in North America read [...] "Celica Supra" [...] and only P-types were available in two-tone color schemes.|$|E
2500|$|The AM/FM antenna was {{integrated}} into the front windshield rather than a typical external mast antenna. There was a key lock on the gas tank door (in lieu of a remote release) and the hatch and rear bumper were black regardless of paint color {{on the rest of}} the car. The P-types were available with an optional rear sunshade above the hatch glass. The lights in the rear featured a reverse light in the center and the door handles opened the doors by pulling sideways. The front nose badge and B-pillar only read [...] "Supra" [...] for the first several months of production, but were changed to read [...] "Celica Supra" [...] midway through the model year. L-types had front and rear <b>mudflaps</b> but P-types of this year did not.|$|E
50|$|Supercomputing {{technology}} {{applied to}} the problem of semi-trailer truck drag has helped to validate such aerodynamic improvements. Traditional solid truck <b>mudflaps</b> can increase drag, but a study by the UT-Chattanooga SimCenter indicated slatted <b>mudflaps</b> can reduce drag more than 8 percent, making the truck's drag coefficient comparable to one without any <b>mudflaps</b> fitted.|$|E
5000|$|In episode 20, [...] "Ice", Starscream and <b>Mudflap</b> {{confront the}} Autobot's human allies as the North Pole, but are opposed by Scattorshot. Although Scattorshot gets {{the better of}} <b>Mudflap</b> initially, Starscream uses water to freeze up Scattorshot's systems. The humans and Mini-Con Recon Team use <b>Mudflap's</b> dropped gun to signal the other Autobots, who come to their rescue.|$|R

5000|$|Landmine {{discovered}} that <b>Mudflap</b> {{had joined the}} Decepticons in episode 27 [...] "Revelations". They fought in episode 28 [...] "Critical." [...] <b>Mudflap</b> followed Megatron to Starscream's island headquarters in episode 29 [...] "Assault," [...] but Landmine followed him there.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Mudflaps</b> can {{be large}} {{rectangular}} sheets suspended behind the tires, {{or may be}} small molded lips below {{the rear of the}} vehicle's wheel wells. <b>Mudflaps</b> can be aerodynamically engineered, utilizing shaping, louvers or vents to improve airflow and lower drag.|$|E
5000|$|The {{state of}} Illinois enacted a statute {{requiring}} curved mud guards, instead of straight <b>mudflaps</b> on trucks driven in Illinois. Although {{there was no}} federal regulation requiring <b>mudflaps</b> or mudguards, Arkansas required straight <b>mudflaps,</b> which were legal in at least 45 states. [...] The Illinois legislature asserted that the unique curved mudguards would be more useful in preventing stones and other debris to be kicked up {{from the back of}} trucks, thus preventing more accidents than other types of <b>mudflaps.</b> The plaintiffs were trucking companies who drove through Illinois and would have to use one form of mudflap equipment while in Illinois, but other mudflap equipment while in other states. The named plaintiff was Navajo Freight Lines, Inc., of New Mexico.|$|E
50|$|This package {{comes with}} Skids and <b>Mudflap</b> {{in the ice}} cream van {{combined}} mode as Skids becomes the front and <b>Mudflap</b> the back. The first release was packaged in van mode, while later releases had both figures packaged in robot modes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mudflap</b> {{appears in}} the second Transformers {{installment}} as an Autobot. This character {{is not related to}} <b>Mudflap</b> who appeared in the toy line for the first film. He, like his twin brother Skids, typically speaks hip-hop. Originally forming an old ice cream truck with Skids, <b>Mudflap</b> gains his own vehicle mode following the Shanghai operation. Their robot modes were revealed for a short time on the web, but were taken off due to the request by Activision.|$|R

40|$|From Brecht to Butler: An Analysis of Dirty Grrrls‚Äù is a {{production}} centered thesis {{focusing on the}} image of the <b>mudflap</b> girl. The study examines the graduate production Dirty Grrrls as a form of praxis intersecting the <b>mudflap</b> girl, the theory of gender performativity, and Brechtian methodology. As a common yet unexplored symbol of hypersexual visual culture in U. S. American society, the <b>mudflap</b> girl acts as a relevant subject matter for both the performance and written portion of the study. Through the production, <b>mudflap</b> girl materializes at the meeting point of the terms performance and performativity. The written portion of this project examines this intersection and discusses the productive cultural work accomplished on the page and on the stage via live embodiment of performativity...|$|R

50|$|A further {{advantage}} of the design is the heat-venting capacity of aerodynamically optimized <b>mudflaps.</b> The improved airflow, commonly engineered into high-performance automobiles, promotes the quick release of otherwise re-circulated water and air from the fenderwell while improving performance by cooling the tires and brakes.|$|E
