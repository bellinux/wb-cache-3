5|$|Abercrombie held a war {{council that}} evening. The options he {{presented}} {{to his staff}} were limited to asking if the next day's attack should be in three ranks or four; the council opted for three. Abercrombie's plan of attack omitted Clerk's recommendation to fortify the summit of Rattlesnake Hill; {{in addition to the}} frontal assault, 4 six-pound guns and a howitzer were to be floated down the La Chute River and <b>mounted</b> <b>at</b> the base of Rattlesnake Hill, with 20 bateaux of troops to support the effort.|$|E

5|$|The {{upper body}} had a baggage {{compartment}} separating the driver's compartment from the crew compartment. Bench {{seats on the}} sides of the vehicle, with under-seat storage, could accommodate six men. The windshield could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible canvas top was <b>mounted</b> <b>at</b> the upper part of the rear body. It fastened to the windshield when erected. Four side pieces could be mounted to protect the crew from the weather.|$|E
5|$|To {{visually}} {{enhance the}} size of this set, the camera was equipped with a 40mm Panavision wide-angle lens and <b>mounted</b> <b>at</b> {{the opposite end of the}} stage, giving Crosby the ability to frame the scenes in his camera with extra space at the bottom and at either side. These areas were filled in later by printing-in process extensions of the set, doubling its size onscreen.|$|E
5|$|Weapon turrets were <b>mounted</b> <b>at</b> {{the nose}} and the middle of {{aircraft}} underbelly. The nose turret could rotate +/- 100° from the aircraft's centerline and could mount either a 40mm (1.57in) grenade launcher, or a 7.62mm (0.308in) minigun. The belly turret included a 30mm (1.18in) automatic cannon with 360° of rotation. Mechanical stops prevented the belly turret from aiming at {{any part of the}} helicopter.|$|E

5|$|When Phillpotts's next comedy, Yellow Sands, {{was to be}} <b>mounted</b> <b>at</b> the Haymarket Theatre in the West End, Richardson and {{his wife}} were both cast in good roles. The play opened in November 1926 and ran until September 1928; with 610 {{performances}} it was the longest London run of Richardson's entire career. During the run Muriel Hewitt began to show early symptoms of encephalitis lethargica, a progressive and ultimately fatal illness.|$|E
5|$|A 1905 {{review of}} the Falmouth defences {{concluded}} that the naval artillery at St Mawes had become superfluous, as the necessary guns could be <b>mounted</b> <b>at</b> combination of Pendennis and the recently re-established battery at St Anthony's instead. Disarmed, St Mawes was then used as a barracks in the First World War. In 1920 the castle {{was transferred to the}} control of the government's Office of Works, and was opened to visitors, being promoted as a tourist destination by the Great Western Railway company who hoped to profit by increased numbers of visitors to Falmouth.|$|E
5|$|Above the {{mounting}} platform was the stabilization gyro. This {{was connected to}} a wedge-shaped metal plate, causing the plate to rotate around a mounting point {{at the tip of}} the wedge. The rear part of the reflector sight was <b>mounted</b> <b>at</b> this point and the opposite end was supported by a rotating pintle inserted into a gudgeon mounted to the frame. Rolling the aircraft caused the gyro to rotate in the same direction, which was geared to cause the opposite motion in the reflector. As the sights worked by reflecting light off the reflector in the center, motion of the mirror would result in twice the motion of the aim point. To address this, the gyro was attached through levers with a 2-to-1 reduction.|$|E

5|$|Boeing {{initially}} {{proposed a}} purpose-built aircraft, but tests indicated {{it would not}} outperform the already-operational 707, so the latter was chosen instead. To increase endurance, this design was to be powered by eight General Electric TF34s. It would carry its radar in a rotating dome <b>mounted</b> <b>at</b> {{the top of a}} forward-swept tail, above the fuselage. Boeing was selected ahead of McDonnell Douglas's DC-8-based proposal in July 1970. Initial orders were placed for two aircraft, designated EC-137D as test beds to evaluate the two competing radars. As the test-beds did not need the same 14-hour endurance demanded of the production aircraft, the EC-137s retained the Pratt & Whitney JT3D commercial engines, and a later reduction in endurance requirement led to retaining the normal engines in production.|$|E
5|$|Both {{tracks and}} wheels {{were used for}} {{steering}}. The steering system was set up so that gentle turns used just the steerable front wheels, but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther the steering wheel was turned. The drive sprocket had the track-saving but more complicated rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of five double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the Schachtellaufwerk layout, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, <b>mounted</b> <b>at</b> the rear of the vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front axle had transversely mounted leaf springs and shock absorbers - the only ones on the vehicle.|$|E
