500|$|Critics {{praised the}} cast for their hamming and {{effective}} delivery of what Bennion called the [...] "stilted, stagy dialogue"; Toby Dantzic, writing for The Telegraph Saturday Review, called the acting [...] "stellar". The {{attention to detail}} by {{the cast and crew}} was widely praised; the [...] "dated styling" [...] was, for Jackson, [...] "spot on". Louisa Mellor, of the entertainment website Den of Geek, explained that [...] "from the aspect ratio to the <b>music,</b> <b>title</b> font, sets, lighting, camera moves, hair, make-up and costume... everything was recognisable from the sort of 1970s television plays that, when you think about it, may have provided inspiration for Inside No. 9 as a whole". For her, [...] "the retro send-up provided enough entertainment on its own—these days {{you have to be very}} good to make TV that bad". White, similarly, argued that [...] "it's a gargantuan, incredibly precise task to make such gloriously terrible TV, a skill reserved for only the greatest of comics". Even despite the flaws of the film within the episode, Rebecca Nicholson, of theguardian.com, found it [...] "relatively gripping". Sarah Hughes, writing in i, compared [...] "The Devil of Christmas" [...] to an episode of Tales of the Unexpected; it was she, argued, [...] "both an immaculately conceived homage to Roald Dahl's original anthology series and a worthy contender for its crown".|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Harmonix and MTV Games {{released}} a new <b>music</b> <b>title</b> through rival publisher Electronic Arts, called Rock Band. It expanded upon the gameplay popularized by the Guitar Hero series by adding drum and microphone instruments, allowing players to simulate playing songs as bands. Activision followed suit {{with the release}} of Guitar Hero World Tour in 2008, which supported multiple instruments. In 2009, Activision tripled its Guitar Hero offerings, and in addition to further continuation of the existing main series with Guitar Hero 5 and expansions, they introduced the titles Band Hero, geared towards more family-friendly pop music, and DJ Hero, a game based on turntablism and featuring a number of mixes. With the release of Guitar Hero 5, Activision considered the series to have moved away from its heavy metal basis into a broader selection of music. Guitar Hero 5 is the first game in the series to use {{a new version of the}} series' logo; previous games used a logo in a font with sharper [...] "points" [...] on the letters, which was considered [...] "idiosyncratic with a vengeance" [...] to match the games' emphasis on heavy metal music. Activision used the services of the Pentagram design studio to refashion the game's logo. Pentagram developed a new font, removing some of the [...] "aggressive odd" [...] features to make the typeface more suitable and amendable to design feature incorporation to other games such as Band Hero and DJ Hero.|$|E
2500|$|Almost a year later, U-God {{released}} his third solo album entitled Dopium, which features guest appearances from several Wu-Tang members, and affiliates, among others, and {{was met with}} mostly lukewarm reviews.

The album features appearances from five Wu-Tang members, along with New York City mainstays AZ, Kool G Rap, Cormega, Havoc, Sean Price, and M.O.P. The first single from Chamber Music was a track titled [...] "Harbor Masters" [...] featuring Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, and AZ. To clear up confusion, RZA spoke about the album to Billboard.com: [...] "I think the Chamber <b>Music</b> <b>title</b> is very fitting. This music is totally in the chamber, or in the mind-frame of Wu-Tang like in the [...] days. But it's not a Wu-Tang album. The whole Clan's not on this album. But it couldn't be in any other category but Wu-Tang.|$|E

It was Toiviainen and Eerola´s idea to combine specific information with a geographical coordinate database. Now geographical comparisons can be made it is possible to follow the geographical variation of musical features. For instance, schools can now identify and trace folk tune originating from their own regions. Musical Data Mining is used for discovering any kind of relevant similarity between <b>music</b> <b>titles.</b> Several algorithms like Apriori, PHP, partition, sampling and some other parallel algorithm have been developed. In this thesis, Apriori and DHP are implemented.
