40|$|To {{evaluate}} the {{positive predictive value}} of the <b>midsagittal</b> <b>view</b> of the fetal brain in recognizing the cause of ventriculomegaly diagnosed with traditional axial scan. METHODS: Fifty-eight pregnant women, referred to our Center following a generic diagnosis of ventriculomegaly have been evaluated: 38 had marked and 20 had borderline ventriculomegaly. The fetal brain was scanned by the <b>midsagittal</b> <b>view</b> using a transabdominal probe in fetuses in breech presentation or transverse lie and a transvaginal probe in fetuses in cephalic presentation. The possible cause of ventriculomegaly was postulated by combining {{the findings of the}} corpus callosum/cavum septi pellucidi complex with those of the posterior fossa. The prenatal diagnoses were compared with the anatomical specimens of aborted fetuses or with postnatal neuroimaging. RESULTS: The prenatal diagnoses were confirmed in 54 / 58 cases (PPV 93. 1...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Transperineal {{ultrasound}} imaging enables the minimally invasive assessment of pelvic floor muscle function. Although {{commonly used in}} women, the approach has rarely been reported in men. This approach has advantages because the <b>midsagittal</b> <b>view</b> visualizes a bony landmark and the entire urethral length. This allows investigation of the displacement of multiple points along the urethra and the unique mechanical actions of multiple muscles that could influence continence. We used a new transperineal ultrasound technique to compare {{the relative displacement of}} urethrovesical junction, anorectal junction and distal urethra during voluntary pelvic floor muscle contractions in continent men...|$|E

The proposed method estimates the parameters of Maeda’s articulatory model on the basis of electromagnetic articulograph data, thus producing full <b>midsagittal</b> <b>views</b> of the vocal tract from the positions of a limited number of sensors attached on articulators. ...|$|R
40|$|Real-Time Magnetic Resonance Imaging affords speech {{articulation}} {{data with}} good {{spatial and temporal}} resolution and complete <b>midsagittal</b> <b>views</b> of the moving vocal tract, but also brings many challenges {{in the domain of}} image processing and analysis. Region-of-interest analysis has previously been proposed for simple, efficient and robust extraction of linguistically-meaningful constriction degree information. However, the accuracy of such methods has not been rigorously evaluated, and no method has been proposed to calibrate the pixel intensity values or convert them into absolute measurements of length. This work provides such an evaluation, as well as insights into the placement of regions in the image plane and calibration of the resultant pixel intensity measurements. Measurement errors are shown to be generally at or below the spatial resolution of the imaging protocol {{with a high degree of}} consistency across time and overall vocal tract configuration, validating the utility of this method of image analysis. 4 page(s...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis study {{presents}} a simulation framework to synthesize running speech from information obtained from simultaneous vocat tract imaging and audio recording. The {{aim is to}} numerically simulate the acoustic and mechanical phenomena that occur during speech production given the actual articulatory gestures of the speaker, so that the simulated speech reproduces the original acoustic features (formant trajectories, prosody, segmentic phonation, etc). The result {{is intended to be}} a copy of the original speech signal, hence the name copy synthesis. The shape of the vocal tract is extracted from 2 D <b>midsagittal</b> <b>views</b> of the vocal tract acquired at a sufficient framerate to get a few images per produced phone. The area functions of the vocal tract are then anatomically realistic, and also account for side cavities. The acoustic simulation framework uses an extended version of the single-matrix formulation that enables a self-oscillating model of the vocal folds with a glottal chink to be connected to the time-varying waveguide network that models the vocal tract. Copy synthesis of a few French sentences shows the accuracy of the simulation framework to reproduce acoustic cues of natural phrase-level utterances containing most of French natural classes while considering the real geometric shape of the speaker. This is intended {{to be used as a}} tool to relate the acoustic features of speech to their articulatory or phonatory origins...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the frontomaxillary facial (FMF) angle in fetuses with trisomy 13 at 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks of gestation. Methods A three-dimensional (3 D) {{volume of the}} fetal head was obtained before karyotyping at 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks of gestation in 23 fetuses with trisomy 13. The FMF angle, defined as the angle between the upper surface of the maxilla and the frontal bone in a <b>midsagittal</b> <b>view</b> of the fetal face, was measured and compared to the angle in 500 chromosomally normal fetuses. Results In 10 of 12 (83. 3 %) fetuses with trisomy 13 and holoprosencephaly, the FMF angle was above the 95 th centile of the normal range. In the 11 fetuses with no holoprosencephaly, the FMF angle was {{not significantly different from}} normal. There {{was no significant difference in}} the FMF angle between the trisomy 13 fetuses with and without facial cleft. Conclusions In fetuses with trisomy 13, the FMF angle at 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks of gestation is increased only in cases with associated holoprosencephaly. Copyright 2007 ISUOG.

40|$|A {{computer-based}} {{tool for}} visualisation of the vocal-tract, during speech articulation, {{by means of}} a <b>midsagittal</b> <b>view</b> of the human head has been designed and developed. The vocal tract graphics are generated using a new approach that is based on estimating both the area functions and the formant frequencies from the acoustic speech signal. First, it is assumed that the speech production process is an autoregressive model. Using a linear prediction analysis, the vocal tract area functions and the first three formants are estimated. The estimated area functions are then mapped to corresponding mid-sagittal distances and displayed as 2 D vocal tract lateral graphics. The mapping process is based on a simple numerical algorithm and an accurate reference grid derived from x-rays for the pronunciation of a number English vowels uttered by different speakers. To compensate for possible errors in the estimated area functions due to variation in vocal tract length between speakers, the first two sectional distances are determined by the three formants. Experimental results show high correlation with x-ray data and the PARAFAC analysis. The tool also displays other speech parameters that are closely related to the production of intelligible speech and hence would be useful as a visual feedback aid for speech training of hearing–impaired individuals and children with speech impediment.

40|$|Background The septal {{cartilage}} is {{the most}} useful donor site for autologous cartilage graft material in rhinoplasty. For successful nasal surgery, {{it is necessary to}} understand the developmental process of the nasal septum and to predict the amount of harvestable septal cartilage before surgery. Methods One hundred twenty-three Korean patients who underwent three-dimensional (3 D) facial bone computed tomography (CT) were selected for evaluation of the <b>midsagittal</b> <b>view</b> of the nasal septum. Multiple parameters such as the area of each component of the nasal septum and the amount of harvestable septal cartilage were measured using Digimizer software. Results The area of the total nasal septum showed rapid growth until the teenage years, but thereafter no significant change throughout the lifetime. However, the development of the septal cartilage showed a gradual decline due to ossification changes with aging after puberty in spite of a lack of change in the total septal area. The area of harvestable septal cartilage in young adults was 549. 84 ± 151. 26 mm 2 and decreased thereafter with age. Conclusions A 3 D facial bone CT scan can provide valuable information on the septal cartilage graft before rhinoplasty. Considering the developmental process of the septal cartilage identified in this study, septal surgery should not be performed until puberty due to the risk of nasal growth impairment. Furthermore, in elderly patients who show a decreased cartilage area due to ossification changes, septal cartilage harvesting should be performed carefully due to the risk of saddle nose deformity...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Bladder wall {{thickness}} (BWT) {{is reported to}} be related to detrusor overactivity and bladder outlet obstruction. We investigated the relationship between BWT and the responsiveness of storage symptoms to alpha-blockers in men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Materials and Methods: A total of 74 patients with LUTS were enrolled. International Prostate Symptom Score, uroflowmetry with post-void residual urine volume, and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) were investigated. BWT was measured by per-forming TRUS at the <b>midsagittal</b> plane <b>view,</b> and the average value of BWT at the ante-rior, dome, and trigone areas was used. After 4 weeks of alpha-blocker medication, pa-tients were reevaluated and divided into two groups. The responder group consisted of patients who reported improvement in the storage symptom subscore of 2 points or more; the non-responder group consisted of patients who reported improvement of less than 2 points. Clinical parameters including BWT were compared between the two groups. Results: A total of 52 patients were followed. BWT was positively correlated with intra...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a visual speech synthesizer providing <b>midsagittal</b> and front <b>views</b> of the vocal tract to help language learners to correct their mispronunciations. We adopt {{a set of}} allophonic rules to determine the visualization of allophonic variations. We also implement coarticulation by decomposing a viseme (visualization of all articulators) into viseme components (visualization of tongue, lips, jaw, and velum separately). Viseme components are morphed independently while the temporally adjacent articulations are considered. Subjective evaluation involving 6 subjects with linguistic background shows that 54 % of their responses prefer having allophonic variations incorporated.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the additional value of three-dimensional (3 D) multiplanar ultrasound in {{the examination of}} the fetal profile. Two 3 D volumes of the fetal head were obtained from 84 fetuses at 22 to 29 weeks' gestation. The volumes were taken starting at the midsagittal plane with the fetus facing the transducer. The success rate and acquisition time to obtain each volume and display the exact midsagittal plane by 3 D multiplanar ultrasound were analyzed. The correction angles from the original two-dimensional (2 D) profile view to the exact midsagittal plane were noted. Of six measurements, related to the fetal nose and jaws, the success rate and the intraobserver reproducibility between the 2 D and the 3 D multiplanar ultrasound were compared. In 81 (96. 4 %) cases we succeeded in obtaining a profile volume, 70 % of the volumes being obtained within 10 min. It was possible to define by multiplanar mode the exact midsagittal plane in less than 1 min. The mean rotation necessary to obtain the exact midsagittal plane with 3 D multiplanar mode was significantly larger around the y-axis (11. 9 degrees) than around the z-axis (4. 3 degrees) of the fetus. For between 5 and 12 % of the six measurements under investigation {{it was not possible to}} obtain values with 2 D ultrasound. However, 3 D ultrasound made these measurements possible in at least one volume. The intraobserver reproducibility was higher with 3 D multiplanar ultrasound than with 2 D ultrasound, this difference being statistically significant for five of the six measurements. 3 D multiplanar ultrasound improves the topographic depiction of the <b>midsagittal</b> profile <b>view,</b> enables correct measurement of anatomical details and improves intraobserver reproducibility. 3 D multiplanar ultrasound is a powerful instrument for investigating the fetal profil...|$|R
40|$|Background Fine {{motor control}} is {{frequently}} impaired {{in children with}} autism, however, speech motor control {{has been found to}} be unimpaired in some studies using perceptual methods. This is despite the need for intricate movement of the tongue required for accurate speech. However, a small number of studies found residual and non-developmental speech errors are significantly higher in a sample of children with autism (33 - 40 %) than the normal adult population (1 - 2 %; Shriberg et al., 2001; Cleland et al., 2010). Conflicting evidence may be due to unreliable perceptual analysis that relies on auditory skills of the assessor. The cause of these speech errors is still in debate. Aim of the study Our research will investigate speech errors in autism using Ultrasound Tongue Imaging (UTI). It will be used to identify any inaccurate or uncoordinated movements of the tongue which could indicate a motor impairment. We aim to determine whether errors in fine motor control are echoed in errors of speech. Using UTI eliminates the higher likelihood of variation and inaccuracy of perceptual assessments. Additionally, we will compare UTI and perceptual assessments to determine whether there are speech errors missed in the clinic through the use of perceptual assessments only. Methods We will compare UTI data with standardized speech assessments. UTI is used in the imaging of speech as it allows investigation of tongue movement. By placing a standard medical ultrasound probe under the chin, most of the surface of the tongue in a <b>midsagittal</b> <b>view</b> is imaged. UTI has been used in the field for decades however until recently it was hard to gain useful data from. Now ultrasound is portable, provides fast frame rates and can synchronize ultrasound images with audio. This allows analysis of tongue movement that can be compared across participants. Fine motor control will be assessed using standardized assessment and specific fine motor measurements. All assessments will analyse the coordination and accuracy of movements of fingers and speech muscles. Conclusions/importance of work It is important to investigate the relationship between speech motor control and fine motor control as it can ultimately change the treatment provided by speech and language therapists (SLTs). If speech errors in autism are a result of a motor control difficulty then traditional speech therapy is less likely to be successful. Therapy needs to specifically target speech motor planning. If perceptual assessments are not sensitive enough to identify speech errors in autism, UTI may be an effective instrument to improve diagnostic accuracy to inform practice...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION In daily {{practice}} {{it is difficult}} to visualize all the normal fetal cerebral midline structures using the axial planes. These planes do not allow direct evaluation of the corpus callosum (CC) and other midline brain structures, thus limiting detection of these midline anomalies on screening scans. The present paper aims to evaluate the role of 3 D techniques in the identification of Central Nervous System (CNS) structures. METHODS Fetal cerebral midline structures from 300 low-risk pregnant women were studied prospectively by 2 D and 3 D ultrasound between 19 - 23 weeks of gestation during last 5 years. Fetal brain was evaluated by various 3 D mode functions such as Oblique technique (OT), OVIX (Oblique View eXtended Imaging), VOCAL and Multi-Slice view. The 3 D Multiplanar Imaging allows a simultaneous analysis of the acquired volume in three planes and is used as {{the first step in the}} process of volume acquisition, as it is the pre-requisite for later analysis. This allows the section plans to be oriented. If this alignment is properly obtained on C plan, the sagittal and the midsagittal plane containing the CC can be easily visualized. Each volume was processed using the OT and OVIX in order to improve the image resolution in the reconstructed planes. More specifically, a <b>midsagittal</b> <b>view</b> of the midline was obtained, and the OVIX box was adjusted on its central core using a slice thickness of 3 mm in order to achieve a coronal view of the CC. Multi-Slice View transforms 3 D volume data obtained from a regular ultrasound scan into a series of sequential images captured at intervals of 0. 5 mm to 5 mm segments. Users can instantly view, analyze and understand the more in-depth data, and thereby gain greater diagnostic confidence and accuracy. VOCAL displays sequential parallel slices of 3 D anatomy to facilitate more precise volume analysis of the structures. 48 out of 300 patients were also evaluated by 5 D CNS plus technique. This technique allows to obtain all the recommended views of the fetal brain for neurosonography, starting from a single axial scan of the fetal head. RESULTS The CC anatomy was accurately reconstructed from axial to sagittal plane in all 48 cases. The CC was visualized as a hypoechoic structure and was divided in four parts: rostrum, genu, body and splenium. This approach allows easily the visualization of the CC, to evaluate its shape, to distinguish normal from abnormal CNS volumes and provide possible diagnoses for abnormal volumes. A complete reconstruction of fetal cerebral views was obtained in 45 of 48 patients, submitted to 5 D CNS plus technique. CONCLUSIONS 3 D ultrasound enables a precise visualization of the normal and abnormal CC in the median plane. 5 D CNS plus was shown to be a reliable technique to obtain in a very short time all the required fetal brain views. No difference was found in terms of time elapsing between the various 3 D technique. The OVIX technique may be the most appropriate for the study of CC...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedUnderstanding human speech {{production}} is of fundamental importance for basic and applied research in human communication: from speech science and linguistics to clinical and engineering development. While the vocal tract posture and movement can be investigated using {{a host of}} techniques, the newly developed real-time (RT) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology has a particular advantage - it produces complete views of the entire moving vocal tract including the pharyngeal structures in a non-invasive manner. RT-MRI promises a new means for visualizing and quantifying the spatio-temporal articulatory details of speech production and it also allows for exploring novel data-intensive, machine learning based computational approaches to speech production modeling.; The central goal of this thesis is to develop new technological capabilities and to use these novel tools for studying human vocal tract shaping during speech production. The research, which is inherently interdisciplinary, combines technological elements (to design engineering methods and systems to acquire and process novel speech production data), experimental elements (to design linguistically meaningful studies to gather useful insights) and computational elements (to explain the observed data and design predictive capabilities).; In the first chapter the use of RT-MRI as an emerging technique for speech production research studies is motivated. An outline is provided of the biomedical image acquisition and image processing challenges, potentials, and opportunities arising {{with the use of}} RT-MRI.; The second part describes novel hardware technology and signal processing algorithms which were developed to facilitate synchronous speech audio recordings during RT-MRI scans. Here, the main problem lies in the loud noise produced by the MRI acquisition process. The proposed solution incorporates digital synchronization hardware and an adaptive signal processing algorithm which allows the acquisition of speech audio with satisfactory quality for further analysis. This enables joint speech-image data acquisition that in turn allows for joint modeling of articulatory-acoustic phenomena.; The third chapter addresses the extraction of relevant geometrical features from the vast stream of MR images. In the case of the commonly used <b>midsagittal</b> <b>view</b> of the human vocal tract the geometrical features of interest are the locations of the articulators, and hence the underlying image processing problem to be solved is that of edge detection. Further complications arise from the poor MR image quality, which is compromised by the inherent trade-off between spatial, temporal resolution, and signal to noise ratio. A solution to the edge detection problem will be devised using a deformable geometrical model of the human vocal tract. Mathematically the proposed procedure relies on designing alternate gradient vector flows for the solution of a non-linear least squares optimization problem. With the new method the human vocal tract outline can be traced automatically.; Chapters 4 and 5 describe two vocal production studies using articulatory vocal tract data. The first study investigates 5 soprano singers' static vocal tract shaping during the singing production of vowel sounds, and it considers the much-researched theory of resonance tuning. The study successfully validates the usefulness of RT-MRI data and the data processing methods of Chapters 2 and 3. The second study focuses on the tongue shaping of English sibilant fricative sounds, and reproduces previously known findings with the new RT-MRI modality.; The last part of this thesis proposes a statistical framework for the modeling of articulatory speech data. Here, the main focus lies on the Coupled Hidden Markov Model as a candidate system to capture the dynamics of the multi-dimensional vocal tract shaping process. It is demonstrated that using this methodology it is possible to capture in a data driven way the well-known timing signatures of the velum-oral coordination of English nasal sounds in word onset and coda positions.; This thesis is concluded with a brief summary of the contributions and a discussion of possible future research directions...|$|E
40|$|SummaryTool use, though rare, is taxonomically widespread, but {{morphological}} adaptations for tool use {{are virtually}} unknown [1]. We {{focus on the}} New Caledonian crow (NCC, Corvus moneduloides), which displays {{some of the most}} innovative tool-related behavior among nonhumans [2 – 6]. One of their major food sources is larvae extracted from burrows with sticks held diagonally [7] in the bill, oriented with individual, but not species-wide, laterality [8, 9]. Among possible behavioral [10] and anatomical adaptations for tool use [5, 11 – 15], NCCs possess unusually wide binocular visual fields (up to 60 °), suggesting that extreme binocular vision may facilitate tool use [5]. Here, we establish that during natural extractions, tool tips can only be viewed by the contralateral eye. Thus, maintaining binocular view of tool tips is unlikely to have selected for wide binocular fields; the selective factor is {{more likely to have been}} to allow each eye to see far enough across the <b>midsagittal</b> line to <b>view</b> the tool’s tip monocularly [5, 16]. Consequently, we tested the hypothesis that tool side preference follows eye preference and found that eye dominance does predict tool laterality across individuals. This contrasts with humans’ species-wide motor laterality and uncorrelated motor-visual laterality [17], possibly because bill-held tools are viewed monocularly and move in concert with eyes, whereas hand-held tools are visible to both eyes and allow independent combinations of eye preference and handedness. This difference may affect other models of coordination between vision and mechanical control, not necessarily involving tools...|$|R
40|$|Background: Paravaginal defects {{are often}} {{assumed to be}} the {{underlying}} anatomical abnormality in anterior compart-ment descent. Neither clinical examination nor ultrasound assessment are generally accepted diagnostic modalities. Aims: To compare clinical examination and translabial 3 D ultrasound in the detection of such defects. Methods: Fifty-nine women without previous prolapse or incontinence surgery were seen prospectively. Clinical and ultrasound assessments were carried out in blinded fashion. 3 D translabial ultrasound was undertaken after voiding and supine. Volumes were acquired at rest, on Valsalva and on levator contraction. Loss of paravaginal support (‘tenting’) in the axial plane was taken to signify paravaginal defects. Results: Paravaginal defects were reported clinically in 14 cases on the left (24 %), 19 times on the right (32 %). Two 3 D ultrasound examinations did not yield satisfactory volumes, leaving 57 for analysis. Neither <b>midsagittal</b> nor coronal <b>views</b> yielded data that correlated with clinical assessments. In the axial plane there was absence of tenting at rest in 32 / 57 (57 %) patients, but this did not correlate with clinical findings. Loss of tenting on Valsalva was observed less often (21 / 57, 37 %) and was weakly associated with clinically observed lateral defects (P = 0. 036). Conclusions: Pelvic floor ultrasound in midsagittal, axial or coronal planes does not correlate well with clinical assess-ment for paravaginal defects. This {{could be due to}} poor clinical assessment technique or limitations of the ultrasound method. On the other hand, paravaginal defects may be uncommon or clinically irrelevant. On present knowledge, the paravaginal defect has to be regarded as an unproven concept. Key words: 3 D ultrasound, incontinence, paravaginal defects, prolapse, translabial ultrasound...|$|R
