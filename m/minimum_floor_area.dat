40|$|Green roofs, also {{referred}} to as vegetated roofs, have increased in popularity in recent years in North America. Traditionally their use had been more prominent in European countries, such as Germany, however the North American design community have recently adopted them, thanks in part to programs such as LEED and the City of Toronto’s Green Roof Bylaw. Toronto’s Green Roof Bylaw mandates “green roofs on new commercial, institutional and residential development with a <b>minimum</b> Gross <b>Floor</b> <b>Area</b> of 2, 000 m 2 as of January 31, 2010 ”. Also contained within the aforementioned Green Roof Bylaw is a requirement that the submitted green roof design explicitly state the uplift wind pressures that it has been designed for, and how the design addresses the stated pressures. This report needs to be stamped by a Professional Engineer. This requirement has led to many questions regarding the wind resistance of a green roof, which is a unique building material in many ways - it is organic, living, porous, and has a variable weight (based on the amount of water it is retaining). Conventional building materials have strict tolerances and highly standardized, whereas the properties of green roofs change on a daily basis. The intent {{of this paper is to}} discuss the design of a green roof in order to prevent lift off/fly away of a green roof assembly. The methods presented are based on applicable standards and building codes, as well as specific testing that has been undertaken on a green roof system to demonstrate its porosity and pressure equalization properties...|$|R

40|$|Background: In many {{countries}} public and political interest {{exists on the}} communicable disease effects of prison crowding, prompting standards on <b>minimum</b> <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> of sleeping accommodation per person. Yet the extent and reliability of the worldwide evidence on the association between prison cell spatial density and communicable diseases is uncertain. Method: We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature for articles that reported on the association between prison cell spatial density and communicable disease effects in prisoners. Included studies were assessed for quality. A draft report was peer-reviewed by an independent researcher. Some revisions were made in light of reviewer comments. Findings: 3, 532 articles were identified and 6 were included. Studies were conducted in the US (1980 s), Pakistan (2003) and Nigeria (2012, 2013). Communicable disease effects/outcomes included pneumococcal disease/acute pneumonia, mycobacterium tuberculosis, infectious skin conditions, and communicable disease reporting to the prison clinic. There was mostly consistent evidence that cell spatial density is associated with communicable diseases. The associations and statistical precision observed suggest a ‘slight’ communicable disease impact of cell spatial density on prisoners. However, {{it is possible that}} these associations are due to confounding, bias and/or chance. Conclusion: The evidence provides some support that communicable disease effects are associated with cell spatial density but care should be taken in the interpretation of the findings. Socio-cultural demographic and historical differences between study populations examined also restrict the generalisability of findings. Key words: Communicable diseases; Population health planning, demography, needs assessment; Justice and ethics Key messages: 1. 	There is paucity of research examining the association between prison cell crowding (‘spatial density’) and communicable disease effects 2. 	The small amount of evidence that exists provides some support that communicable disease effects in prisoners are associated with prison cell spatial density 3. 	Care should be taken in the interpretation of these findings, as associations may be due to confounding, bias and/or chance...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT (for the AIARG Conference, January 2016) Dublin City Council (DCC) {{is proposing}} {{a range of}} {{substantive}} measures, which it is claimed will affect {{a reduction in the}} cost of constructing housing schemes in order to improve supply. The salient points of the proposals are {{the creation of a new}} “studio apartment” category with <b>minimum</b> <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> of 45 sq. m., a reduction in the number of dual aspect apartments (from 85 % of units in any scheme to 50 %), the ratio of circulation cores to apartments, removal of the ban on north facing units (as long as the unit overlooks an amenity) and an increase in the height of residential schemes from 7 to 8 storeys. Certain housing policy experts and commentators argue that the council’s current housing standards are pricing out the poorer or even average buyer by creating an “enclave for the wealthy within the city” (e. g. Ronan Lyons (TCD), Village Magazine, 6 Nov. 2014, Eoin Burke-Kennedy, Irish Times, 17 April 2015, et al) - hence the measures are necessary. Other housing experts disagree or at least remain unconvinced (Herne (NUIM), Sirr (DIT) et al). Irish housing space standards usually followed those of Britain and generally resulted from crises of overcrowding, urban dilapidation or panic by the establishment fearing onerous social demands after wars. The Parker Morris “Homes for Today and Tomorrow” (1961) standards were the required national code until DCC began to improve on these. A brief comparative review of standards abroad and in Ireland based on previous research (Brady / Roche, 2014) will contextualise the development of space standards in Irish housing while arguing that they are not overly generous and are contingent on many other factors. Quality depends on more than size as an exploration of single and dual aspect apartments from built schemes will highlight. In addition the issues of building density, population footfall, cultural attitudes to private/public space and varied fire safety regulations all impact on the quality of housing schemes across Europe but particularly between Ireland / Britain and the rest of Europe. This research paper will then seek to answer the following questions that are posited by the proposed DCC changes to housing standards: Does the changing demographic in Ireland and particularly in Dublin justify a 45 sq m. unit and could a smaller ‘starter’ dwelling be integral to a new way of living including a sharing of communal facilities (e. g. kitchens, until hitherto the preserve of domestic space) as was envisaged by Karel Teige in his seminal work The Minimum Dwelling. Could more flexible and adaptable dwellings offer solutions to changing demographics, new ways of living and cost of production? Can new technologies and prefabrication building systems assist? What is really behind the changes and what is really impeding supply of new dwellings? A critical review of exemplars in new housing internationally and examples of students’ housing projects from DSA in recent years will posit the notion that innovative architectural design solutions can contribute positively to solving the apparent dilemma of cost versus adequate space standards...|$|E
