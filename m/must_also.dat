5|$|Many feminist economists argue {{economics}} {{should be}} focused less on mechanisms (like income) or theories (such as utilitarianism) {{and more on}} well-being, a multidimensional concept including income, health, education, empowerment and social status. They argue that economic success {{can not be measured}} only by goods or gross domestic product, but <b>must</b> <b>also</b> be measured by human well-being. Aggregate income is not sufficient to evaluate general well-being, because individual entitlements and needs <b>must</b> <b>also</b> be considered, leading feminist economists to study health, longevity, access to property, education, and related factors.|$|E
