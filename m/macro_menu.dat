Q&A Write featured a 100,000 word spell check, a 660,000 word thesaurus, a dictionary, formatting options such as page layout, columnar formatting, automatic page numbering and headers, as well as support for the addition of graphics. Additionally, it offered multifont printing support {{and the ability to}} hot-link elements of a Lotus 1-2-3 document, Symphony spreadsheet or Lotus PIC graphs, to Q&A Write documents. Macros could be stored in an ASCII text file created with a text editor, Q&A Write or by recording keys; the <b>Macro</b> <b>Menu</b> could be accessed from many locations by pressing Shift-F2.|$|E

Spreadsheet software {{has proven to be}} an important pedagogical tool for a variety of problems in electrical engineering education. Using the power of the 123 <b>macros,</b> a <b>menu</b> driven spreadsheet program is used to compute the solution of some electrostatic boundary value problems for an introductory-level electromag-netics course. With the on-screen numerical and visual feedback and the ease of entering data, students {{will be able to take}} a close look at the effects of varying the input data of the model problems.

40|$|Skewness {{indicates}} {{a lack of}} symmetry in a distribution. The coefficient of skewness is the commonly used measure to identify a lack of symmetry in the underlying data, although graphical procedures can also be effective. We have developed two comprehensive and efficient SAS ® macros for computing the various skewness measures and the appropriate power transformation, if one exists, to make an asymmetric distribution symmetric. We present two SAS ® macros, %Symm and %Symmchk, which primarily utilize the UNIVARIATE procedure in SAS ® {{and a few other}} built-in macro calls. Our SAS ® <b>macros</b> provide a <b>menu</b> of options to perform all computations efficiently and suggest an appropriate power transformation, if one exists, to make the data symmetric. This latter part is noteworthy in that we not only address the problem i. e., identify whether a given data set has an underlying symmetric distribution, but also provide a solution. Real data from clinical studies will be used to demonstrate the methods and its application using the SAS ® macros...|$|R
