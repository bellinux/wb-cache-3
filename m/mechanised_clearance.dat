40|$|Spainâ€™s {{membership}} of the European Union (EU) has brought obligations and opportunities under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The CAP provides subsidies for the planting of tree crops, such as olives and almonds, and {{has resulted in the}} development of extensive plantations on previously abandoned and unproductive land. In semi arid Almeria, such development typically begins with <b>mechanised</b> <b>clearance</b> of the native, semi-natural vegetation, which is dumped or burned. This study uses airborne imagery from 1982, 1996 and 2001 to examine the changing status of vegetation in undeveloped areas near to the town of Sorbas in Almeria province, a region where extensive clearance for tree crops has been occurring for at least a decade. Initial estimates made from the imagery were surprising, with the density of semi natural vegetation in certain areas seeming to have increased during the five-year interval. Shrub counts made from aerial photography indicated a significantly increased shrub density in parts of the study area. Further analysis of NDVI images from the two later dates, in conjunction with detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) revealed an apparently significant increase in vegetation, mainly on north, east and west facing slopes. Virtually no change was detected on south facing slopes. A series of hypotheses was assessed to account for this change. Recent climate records for the area show no significant change in rainfall patterns, although there is substantial inter-annual variation. Fire recovery was also considered, but municipality records indicate that the area has not been burnt since at least 1977, when municipal logging of detailed fire records began. Recovery of maquis/matorral vegetation is expected to be significantly quicker than this. Anecdotal evidence suggested the potential importance of changes in grazing patterns and, upon further investigation, the number of goats recorded as being grazed in the Sorbas area was found to have fallen significantly since the 1960 s, despite the total for Almeria province remaining effectively the same. In an attempt to validate results from the airborne data, a set of large (15 m x 15 m) quadrats, initially surveyed in 1997 / 98 for a different project, was resurveyed in April 2003. No statistically significant change in vegetation density was detected, though {{this may be due to}} the small sample size (many quadrats could not be precisely re-located), a change in survey personnel, and the inherent subjectivity in assessing ground cover. If the apparent vegetation succession is validated and if, as suspected, the semi-natural vegetation sequesters more carbon than the agricultural crops, then the EU would appear to be subsidising the destruction of what might be a substantial European carbon sink...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{mechanical}} {{stress in the}} Venus clam Chamelea gallina during hydraulic dredging were assessed in both laboratory and field studies {{in order to measure}} physiological biomarkers at organism level (clearance rate, respiration rate, scope for growth, and survival in air test). In the laboratory, mechanical stress was simulated by shaking clams in a vortex mixer. In the field, clams were collected seasonally at two sites along the northern Adriatic coast (Lido and Jesolo) and four levels of stress were applied: the highest was that used in commercial fishing (i. e. high water pressure and mechanised sorting) and the lowest manual sampling by SCUBA divers. Survival in air was the most sensitive biomarker in evaluating mechanical stress in the laboratory. Clearance rate also decreased significantly when shaking was applied. Field results indicated that high water pressure and <b>mechanised</b> sorting affected <b>clearance,</b> scope for growth and survival in air, all showing decreasing trends as mechanical stress increased at both sampling sites. The detrimental effects of mechanical disturbance may be emphasised depending on season, when exogenous and endogenous stress increases. A potential risk is highlighted mostly for undersized clams that are fished and then discarded...|$|R
