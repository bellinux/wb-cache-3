5|$|My Lords, I apologise to noble Lords {{for this}} {{dramatic}} last-minute but not opportunistic maiden speech. Although I inherited my title 30 {{years ago and}} have attended spasmodically, particularly during the early 1970s when we rigorously debated the Industrial Relations Bill and the European Community Bill of Accession, both in Committee and on Report until extremely late at night, my heart has not entirely been in the thrust and cut of politics, unlike <b>my</b> <b>more</b> distinguished ancestors.|$|E
25|$|In Kōchi, {{which was}} not the home {{prefecture}} {{of any of the}} candidates, the turnout was 45.52%, a 4.37% fall from the previous election. Turnout in Kōchi city and three other cities within the prefecture fell <b>my</b> <b>more</b> than 5%, and the village of Umaji saw a fall of almost 10%. Attendance at pre-polling booths saw an increase from 20.3% of participating voters in 2013 to 25.9% in 2016. On top of the poor turnout, 6.15% of those who turned out cast an invalid vote, compared to 3.55% in 2013, and nine voters left the polling booth without submitting their ballot.|$|E
25|$|By the way, {{would you}} convey my {{compliments}} to the purist who reads your proofs {{and tell him}} or her that I write {{in a sort of}} broken-down patois which is something like the way a Swiss-waiter talks, and that when I split an infinitive, God damn it, I split it so it will remain split, and when I interrupt the velvety smoothness of <b>my</b> <b>more</b> or less literate syntax with a few sudden words of barroom vernacular, this is done with the eyes wide open and the mind relaxed and attentive. The method may not be perfect, but it is all I have.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the next}} few months, the tempo of {{operations}} increased, forcing the Sixth Army to plan and execute multiple operations simultaneously. Operations Reckless and Persecution in April 1944 together comprised the largest operation yet in SWPA, with the 24th and 41st Infantry Divisions of Lieutenant General Robert L. Eichelberger's I Corps landing at Tanahmerah and Humboldt bays near Hollandia, while the 163rd Regimental Combat Team landed at Aitape. Eichelberger was Krueger's most senior subordinate, but {{when he did not}} meet Krueger's expectation, Krueger let him know in no uncertain terms. [...] "In <b>my</b> <b>more</b> than 40 years as an officer", Krueger told one of his staff, [...] "I have never raised my voice to an enlisted man, but a corps commander should know better." ...|$|E
500|$|Overall, One Hot Minute lyrically {{confronted the}} dark, melancholy and remorseful {{feelings}} Kiedis kept to himself. Many {{of the songs}} were written {{at a time when}} he was hiding his resumed addiction. [...] "Warped" [...] directly faced Kiedis's distraught moods as a hysterical cry for help: [...] "My tendency for dependency is offending me/It's upending me/I'm pretending to be strong and free from my dependency/It's warping me." [...] He also felt disappointed that [...] "no one had suspected that I'd slipped from <b>my</b> <b>more</b> than five years of sobriety." [...] The track itself was composed of heavy guitar riffs and echoing vocals which attempted to convey a distressed state. [...] "Aeroplane", the album's third single, was more upbeat than many of the album's songs; but it still contained various references to Kiedis's personal issues: [...] "Looking into my own eyes/I can't find the love I want/Someone better slap me before I start to rust/before I start to decompose." [...] The song also featured Flea's daughter Clara and her kindergarten class singing backing vocals on the last verse.|$|E
500|$|The {{style of}} Uematsu's {{compositions}} is diverse, ranging from stately classical symphonic pieces and heavy metal to new-age and hyper-percussive techno-electronica. For example, in Lost Odyssey, the score ranges from classical orchestral arrangements to contemporary jazz and techno tracks. Uematsu {{has stated that}} he is a big fan of Celtic and Irish music, and some of his work contains elements from these musical styles. Uematsu's Final Fantasy scores vary from upbeat, to dark and angry, to melancholic in nature. For instance, the music of Final Fantasy VIII is dark and gloomy, while the soundtrack to Final Fantasy IX is more carefree and upbeat. His Final Fantasy music has been described as being able to convey the true emotion of a scene; an example is [...] "Aerith's Theme" [...] from Final Fantasy VII. In an interview with the Nichi Bei Times, Uematsu said [...] "I don't really self-consciously compose music for Japan or for the world, but I do think there is something in <b>my</b> <b>more</b> melancholy pieces that has a distinctly Japanese quality." [...] He has been named one of the [...] "Innovators" [...] in Time Magazines [...] "Time 100: The Next Wave — Music" [...] feature. He has also been called the [...] "John Williams of the video game world" [...] and been credited for [...] "increasing the appreciation and awareness" [...] of video game music.|$|E

500|$|In {{the year}} before Duncan's arrival at Wake Forest University, the Demon Deacons reached the Sweet 16, but then lost main scorer Rodney Rogers, who entered the 1993 NBA draft. In the 1993–94 NCAA season, Coach Dave Odom was {{considering}} redshirting Duncan, but was forced to play him after fellow freshman big man Makhtar N'Diaye was ruled out due to NCAA rules violations and eventually transferred to Michigan. Duncan struggled with early transition problems and was even held scoreless in his first college game, but as the year progressed, he and teammate Randolph Childress led the Deacons to a 20–11 win-loss record. Duncan's style of play was simple but effective, combining an array of low-post moves, mid-range bank shots and tough defense. He was chosen to represent the U.S. in the 1994 Goodwill Games. Meanwhile, Duncan worked towards a degree in psychology and also took classes in anthropology and Chinese literature. Despite focusing heavily on basketball, Wake Forest psychology department chairperson Deborah Best was quoted: [...] "Tim [...] was one of <b>my</b> <b>more</b> intellectual students. [...] Other than his height, I couldn't tell him from any other student at Wake Forest." [...] Duncan also established {{his reputation as a}} stoic player, to the extent that opposing fans taunted him as [...] "Mr. Spock", the prototypical logical, detached character from Star Trek.|$|E
500|$|In 1945, O'Hara starred {{opposite}} Paul Henreid in The Spanish Main as feisty noblewoman Contessa Francesca, {{the daughter}} of a Mexican viceroy. O'Hara described it as [...] "one of <b>my</b> <b>more</b> decorative roles", as her character is a particularly aggressive one among the men on a ship, and {{during the course of the}} film her face is smothered in chimney soot. O'Hara almost did not win the role when another actress falsely told RKO executive Joe Nolan that she was [...] "as big as a horse" [...] after giving birth to a daughter in 1944. Around this time [...] "an actress named Kathryn" [...] also falsely accused O'Hara of making sexual advances towards her in an elevator, which she believed was a way for the actress to gain attention at the start of her career. During the production of The Spanish Main, O'Hara was visited by John Ford, who was initially turned away for being shabbily dressed, but was later admitted to informing her about the project that would become The Quiet Man (1952). Malone notes that in the film O'Hara [...] "shows her determination not to leave her sexuality at the birthing stool", commenting that she looks [...] "deliciously fragrant in the splashy histrionics on view here, in RKO's first film in the three-color Technicolor process" [...] O'Hara became a naturalized citizen of the United States on 24 January 1946, and held dual citizenship with the US and her native Ireland.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} for Billboard magazine, Beyoncé described I Am... Sasha Fierce as a double album. She said, [...] "One side has songs that are more mainstream and another has <b>my</b> <b>more</b> traditional R songs for my fans who've been there the whole time. Some of it sounds like Barbra Streisand, Karen Carpenter and The Beatles around the 1970s." [...] Music writer Andy Kellman of AllMusic viewed its first disc as, [...] "essentially a small set of adult contemporary ballads. Acoustic guitars, pianos, strings, contemplative soul searching, and grand sweeping gestures fill it out, with more roots in '70s soft rock than soul." [...] The second disc, Sasha Fierce, contains consistent electro influences, which are displayed in songs like [...] "Radio" [...] and [...] "Sweet Dreams". Kellman said in his review that [...] "Diva" [...] resembles B'Days [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] or [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] in terms of audacity. Despite being on the Sasha Fierce disc, [...] "Ego", [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] and [...] "Scared of Lonely" [...] were noted to be a meeting ground between the album's halves. According to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News, they resemble Sasha Fierce musically, but thematically and lyrically, they are vulnerable like Beyoncé on the I Am... disc. The album formally introduces Beyoncé's alter ego Sasha Fierce. She revealed that Sasha was born during the making of her hit single [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] (2003). In {{an interview}} with Emmet Sullivan of People magazine, Beyoncé affirmed that her alter ego is strictly for the stage, with the editor describing Sasha Fierce as the singer's sensual, aggressive alter ego.|$|E

2500|$|Connery was a keen {{football}}er, having {{played for}} Bonnyrigg Rose in his younger days. He {{was offered a}} trial with East Fife. While on tour with South Pacific, Connery played in a football match against a local team that Matt Busby, manager of Manchester United, happened to be scouting. According to reports, Busby was impressed with his physical prowess and offered Connery a contract worth £25 a week immediately after the game. Connery admits that he was tempted to accept, but he recalls, [...] "I realised that a top-class footballer could be over the hill {{by the age of}} 30, and I was already 23. I decided to become an actor {{and it turned out to}} be one of <b>my</b> <b>more</b> intelligent moves." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brown {{traveled}} to Japan to study Buddhism, studying with Christian/Zen practitioner Hugo Enomiya-Lassalle under Yamada Koun-roshi. In an interview, he explained, [...] "Since politics {{is based on}} illusions, zazen definitely provides new insights for a politician. I then {{come back into the}} world of California and politics, with critical distance from some of <b>my</b> <b>more</b> comfortable assumptions." [...] He also visited Mother Teresa in Calcutta, India, where he ministered to the sick in one of her hospices. He explained, [...] "Politics is a power struggle {{to get to the top}} of the heap. Calcutta and Mother Teresa are about working with those who are at the bottom of the heap. And to see them as no different than yourself, and their needs as important as your needs. And you're there to serve them, and doing that you are attaining as great a state of being as you can." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of the band's most {{striking}} aspects is B-Real's exaggeratedly high-pitched nasal vocals. In the book Check the Technique, B-Real describes his nasal style, saying his rapping voice is [...] "high and annoying... the nasal style I have {{was just something}} that I developed... <b>my</b> <b>more</b> natural style wasn't so pleasing to DJ Muggs and Sen Dog's ears" [...] {{and talking about the}} nasal style in the book How to Rap, B-Real says, [...] "you want to stand out from the others and just be distinct... when you got something that can separate you from everybody else, you gotta use it to your advantage." [...] In the film Art of Rap, B-Real credits the Beastie Boys as an influence when developing his rapping style. Sen Dog's voice is deeper, more violent and often shouted alongside the rapping; his vocals are often emphasized by adding another background/choir voice to say them. Sen Dog's style is in contrast to B-Real's, who says, [...] "Sen's voice is so strong," [...] and [...] "it all blends together" [...] when they are both on the same track.|$|E

5000|$|With {{its message}} of world peace, {{simplicity}} and the brotherhood of man, Télémaque {{was a favorite}} of Montesquieu and of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and through him of the French revolutionaries and of German Romantics such as Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803), who approvingly quotes Fénelon's remark [...] "I love <b>my</b> family <b>more</b> than myself; <b>more</b> than <b>my</b> family <b>my</b> fatherland; <b>more</b> than <b>my</b> fatherland humankind".
