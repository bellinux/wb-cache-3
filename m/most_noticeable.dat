5|$|On May 24, 2011, The Criterion Collection {{released}} Solaris on Blu-ray Disc. The <b>most</b> <b>noticeable</b> {{difference from}} the previous 2002 Criterion DVD release was that the blue and white tinted monochrome scenes from the film were restored.|$|E
50|$|One of the <b>most</b> {{immediately}} <b>noticeable</b> {{features of}} the first V form engine to be designed by Rover for decades is its distinctive, quietly growling engine note.|$|R
50|$|Structures {{involved}} in reproduction often appear as discs, bumps, or squiggly {{lines on the}} surface of the thallus. The thallus is not always the part of the lichen that is <b>most</b> visually <b>noticeable.</b> Some lichens can grow inside solid rock between the grains (endolithic lichens), with only the sexual fruiting part visible growing outside the rock. These may be dramatic in color or appearance. Forms of these sexual parts are not in the above growth form categories. The <b>most</b> visually <b>noticeable</b> reproductive parts are often circular, raised, plate-like or disc-like outgrowths, with crinkly edges, and are described in sections below.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>most</b> {{immediately}} <b>noticeable</b> {{difference between}} Ant and Make is that Ant uses XML {{to describe the}} build process and its dependencies, whereas Make uses Makefile format. By default the XML file is named [...]|$|R
5|$|Since its {{dismissal}} several Ministers of {{the second}} Tymoshenko Government {{have been involved in}} criminal proceedings against them; the <b>most</b> <b>noticeable</b> outcomes of this were the imprisonments of former Prime Minister Tymoshenko and Interior Minister Yuriy Lutsenko.|$|E
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>noticeable</b> {{difference}} in behaviour between a distributed element filter and its lumped-element approximation {{is that the}} former will have multiple passband replicas of the lumped-element prototype passband, because transmission line transfer characteristics repeat at harmonic intervals. These spurious passbands are undesirable in most cases.|$|E
5|$|Wallace gives {{a lively}} {{description}} {{of the people of}} the town, and of the wildlife of the island. He finds the Chinese the <b>most</b> <b>noticeable</b> of the people, while in one square mile of forest he found 700 species of beetles including 130 longhorns.|$|E
50|$|Ronga is grammatically {{so close}} to Tsonga in many ways that census {{officials}} often consider it a dialect; its noun class system is very similar and its verbal forms are almost identical. Its <b>most</b> immediately <b>noticeable</b> difference is a much greater influence from Portuguese, due to being centred near the capital Maputo (formerly Lourenço Marques).|$|R
25|$|Female-female {{examples}} are <b>most</b> historically <b>noticeable</b> {{in the narrative}} arts: the archaic lyrics of Sappho; The Songs of Bilitis; novels {{such as those of}} Christa Winsloe, Colette, Radclyffe Hall, and Jane Rule, and films such as Mädchen in Uniform. More recently, lesbian homoeroticism has flowered in photography and the writing of authors such as Patrick Califia and Jeanette Winterson.|$|R

5|$|For Visitation of 1733, Bach revised his Magnificat, {{creating}} the version better known today. In that version, transposed to D major, the laudes interpolations were abandoned. Limited differences in instrumentation include replacing the recorders by flutes and including {{these in the}} tutti movements. Changes in musical texture were even smaller, mellowing the harmony {{near the end of}} the Omnes generationes movement being the <b>most</b> <b>noticeable.</b>|$|E
5|$|More taxonomic {{changes have}} {{occurred}} at the genus level, although these revisions have proven more conclusive, often supported by genetic and molecular analysis. The <b>most</b> <b>noticeable</b> revisions included the gradual split of a broadly defined genus Lemur into separate genera for the ring-tailed lemur, ruffed lemurs, and brown lemurs due {{to a host of}} morphological differences.|$|E
5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>noticeable</b> of the N3 {{design was}} the {{concentration}} of the main battery forward of the bridge and machinery spaces. A related feature of the design was the tower bridge structure behind the first two gun turrets. This provided a better and more stable foundation for fire-control equipment, greatly improved accommodation and protection from the weather.|$|E
25|$|The {{duration}} of apparent action is usually {{considerably less than}} the half-life. With <b>most</b> benzodiazepines, <b>noticeable</b> effects usually wear off within a few hours. Nevertheless, {{as long as the}} drug is present it will exert subtle effects within the body. These effects may become apparent during continued use or may appear as withdrawal symptoms when dosage is reduced or the drug is stopped.|$|R
25|$|Betalains are a {{class of}} red and yellow indole-derived {{pigments}} found in plants of the Caryophyllales, where they replace anthocyanin pigments. Betalains also occur in some higher order fungi. They are <b>most</b> often <b>noticeable</b> in the petals of flowers, but may color the fruits, leaves, stems, and roots of plants that contain them. They include pigments such as those found in beets.|$|R
50|$|Features on {{the outer}} shell of the mussel, whether {{juvenile}} or adult, are often fine or hard to distinguish. In some cases streaks or waves are apparent, which are <b>most</b> easily <b>noticeable</b> on the dorsal region of the outer shell. Most individuals however have green waves, which are a similar hue {{as the rest of}} the shell and are often minute.|$|R
5|$|Scientist Bill Austin of Khoyatan Marine Lab in the Northeast Pacific {{examined}} a video {{made during the}} National Geographic dives to identify the benthic flora and fauna of Bowie Seamount. From the video, Austin recognized some of the <b>most</b> <b>noticeable</b> invertebrates and noted that a few species generally occurring in the intertidal zone and in shallow subtidal environments were found deeper than might normally be expected, and were bigger than normal.|$|E
5|$|The first {{symptoms}} are often mistakenly attributed to ageing or stress. Detailed neuropsychological testing can reveal mild cognitive difficulties {{up to eight}} years before a person fulfils the clinical criteria for diagnosis of AD. These early symptoms can affect the most complex activities of daily living. The <b>most</b> <b>noticeable</b> deficit is short term memory loss, which shows up as difficulty in remembering recently learned facts and inability to acquire new information.|$|E
5|$|There are {{symmetrical}} {{differences between}} the left- and right-hand sides of the painting. This is <b>most</b> <b>noticeable</b> with the buttress, where the receding edges are over half again the size {{of those on the}} front sides. In addition, the breadth of the buttress contradicts the spatial depth of the much tighter space inhabited by the Virgin and Child. This is a technical issue with foreshortening Campin also struggled with, but which van der Weyden resolves in his mature work.|$|E
50|$|The {{duration}} of apparent action is usually {{considerably less than}} the half-life. With <b>most</b> benzodiazepines, <b>noticeable</b> effects usually wear off within a few hours.

These effects may become apparent during continued use or may appear as withdrawal symptoms when dosage is reduced or the drug is stopped.|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} {{rectangular}} in plan, with a hipped slate roof. The <b>most</b> immediately <b>noticeable</b> feature {{is a large}} Venetian window {{on the first floor}} which is set in a semi-circular arch of stone panels. Below is an ironwork balcony with stands above the entry porch. The interior serves partly as a display space for paintings by the Staithes group of artists.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>most</b> {{immediately}} <b>noticeable</b> {{aspect of}} the story is that many characters are —cat-like features (in this case, ears and tails) are universal from birth, so there are as many catboys, including the protagonist, as there are catgirls. People in the Loveless universe lose their animal features when they lose their virginity. Those who no longer have animal features are differentiated by society as [...] "adults".|$|R
5|$|At 5ft 4in (1.62m), Burnham was slight, but he {{was also}} muscular and bronzed, with a finely formed square jaw. He had a boyish {{appearance}} which he used to his advantage on numerous occasions. His <b>most</b> <b>noticeable</b> feature was his steady, grey-blue eyes. Contemporary reports had it that Burnham's gaze appeared to never leave those of the person he was looking at, and yet somehow could simultaneously monitor all the details of the physical surroundings. It was also said that Burnham's eyes possessed a far-away look such as those acquired by people whose occupation has caused them to watch continually at sea or on great plains.|$|E
5|$|Its <b>most</b> <b>noticeable</b> {{effect is}} due to its first unique feature: flavour {{changing}}. A neutron, for example, is heavier than a proton (its sister nucleon), but it cannot decay into a proton without changing the flavour (type) {{of one of its}} two down quarks to an up quark. Neither the strong interaction nor electromagnetism permit flavour changing, so this proceeds by weak decay; without weak decay, quark properties such as strangeness and charm (associated with the quarks of the same name) would also be conserved across all interactions.|$|E
5|$|The AH-64D Apache Longbow is {{equipped}} with a glass cockpit and advanced sensors, the <b>most</b> <b>noticeable</b> of which being the AN/APG-78 Longbow millimeter-wave fire-control radar (FCR) target acquisition system and the Radar Frequency Interferometer (RFI), housed in a dome located above the main rotor. The radome's raised position enables target detection while the helicopter is behind obstacles (e.g. terrain, trees or buildings). The AN/APG-78 is capable of simultaneously tracking up to 128 targets and engaging up to 16 at once, an attack can be initiated within 30 seconds. A radio modem integrated with the sensor suite allows data to be shared with ground units and other Apaches; allowing them to fire on targets detected by a single helicopter.|$|E
5000|$|Lamborghini {{launched}} a facelifted Diablo in 1999, simplifying the model range {{by eliminating the}} [...] "base" [...] Diablo (since the SV model had become the new entry-level trim anyway) and applying universal revisions across the lineup. The <b>most</b> immediately <b>noticeable</b> exterior change was {{the replacement of the}} previous Diablo's pop-up headlamp units with fixed composite lenses, borrowed under license from their original application in the Nissan 300ZX Z32. All Diablos were also fitted with new 18 inch wheels.|$|R
50|$|Once a {{conductive}} channel bridges the air {{gap between the}} negative charge excess in the cloud and the positive surface charge excess below, a massive electrical discharge follows. This is the 'return stroke' {{and it is the}} <b>most</b> luminous and <b>noticeable</b> part of the lightning discharge.|$|R
50|$|The <b>most</b> {{well-known}} and <b>noticeable</b> {{feature of the}} area is the Monmouthshire & Brecon Canal. It splits the district roughly in half: it enters the district at the Five Locks Estate, divides the Lowlands and South Pontnewydd areas into two and continues down through Forge Hammer, towards Old Cwmbran.|$|R
5|$|The PlayStation 2 {{version of}} Guilty Gear X2 has sold well in Japan; over 140,000 copies were sold between 2002 and 2004. In {{addition}} to the public reception, the game has been praised by video game critics. Several aspects were commended, the <b>most</b> <b>noticeable</b> being its gameplay, visuals, music, and new additions from Guilty Gear X, the second game in the series. It {{was found to be}} the best title of the series, as well {{as one of the best}} titles of the year, on the console, and on the genre by some reviewers. Since its release, it has received five updated versions, each offering additional features over previous versions.|$|E
5|$|The Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech is the 1930 Ford Model A Sport coupe {{that serves}} as the {{official}} mascot of the student body at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The Wreck is present at all major sporting events and student body functions. Its <b>most</b> <b>noticeable</b> role is leading the football team into Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field, a duty which the Wreck has performed since 1961. The Ramblin' Wreck is mechanically and financially maintained on campus by students in Ramblin' Reck Club.|$|E
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>noticeable</b> {{feature of}} the fort is the {{circular}} keep. This was modeled on the reduit de surete of the Lunette d'Arçon, and it also bears similarities to the tour-reduits built in Malta in the early 18th century (the only surviving example is Vendôme Tower). It had two rows of musketry loopholes, and its roof contained a parapet with four embrasures. The latter was replaced with a sloping parapet to mount a single gun in the 1860s. The keep also contains the main gate, above which is a commemorative plaque.|$|E
500|$|Citizen Kane {{has been}} called the most {{influential}} film of all time. Richard Corliss has asserted that Jules Dassin's 1941 film The Tell-Tale Heart was the first example of its influence and the first pop culture reference to the film occurred later in 1941 when the spoof comedy Hellzapoppin' featured a [...] "Rosebud" [...] sled. The film's cinematography was almost immediately influential and in 1942 American Cinematographer wrote [...] "without a doubt the <b>most</b> immediately <b>noticeable</b> trend in cinematography methods during the year was the trend toward crisper definition and increased depth of field." ...|$|R
50|$|Astronauts are not {{the only}} ones who benefit from space {{medicine}} research. Several medical products have been developed that are space spinoffs, that is practical applications for the field of medicine arising out of the space program. Because of joint research efforts between NASA, the National Institutes on Aging (a part of the National Institutes of Health), and other aging-related organizations, space exploration has benefited a particular segment of society, seniors. Evidence of aging related medical research conducted in space was <b>most</b> publicly <b>noticeable</b> during STS-95 (See below).|$|R
