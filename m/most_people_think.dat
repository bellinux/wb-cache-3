[...] The old definition of what a family is... the nuclear family- no longer seems adequate to cover the wide diversity of household arrangements we see today, according to many social scientists (Edwards 1991; Stacey 1996). Thus has arisen the term postmodern family, which is meant to describe the great variability in family forms, including single-parent families and child-free couples."- Brian K. Williams, Stacey C.

500|$|According to U.S. News & World Report, Romm {{believes}} {{that global warming}} [...] "is advancing more swiftly than <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> and than the mainstream media usually report. [...] He has called for significantly ramping up government spending on clean energy technology, halting {{the construction of new}} coal plants, rapidly increasing the use of energy-efficient technologies, and imposing a cap-and-trade system to sharply limit carbon dioxide emissions". [...] In 2006, in a radio interview, Romm stated, [...] "Global warming is going to transform this country and our transportation and the way we live our lives. [...] If we don't act pretty soon, in an intelligent fashion, then change will be forced upon us by the radically changed climate... global warming is the issue of the century". [...] In March 2009, Romm summarized and updated his views in an [...] "introduction" [...] to his blog, and in another post, setting forth a summary of [...] "global warming impacts".|$|E
500|$|Jeff {{appeared}} at Kick Butts Day, a protest {{organized by the}} Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and youth advocates, which was held outside Philip Morris' annual shareholders' meeting in New York City on May 6, 2015. The protests featured a flash mob with fifty dancers performing a choreographed dance to a song with the lyrics, [...] "We don't want your cigarettes. Jeff we can!" [...] The performance ended with the mascot: [...] "rolling {{around on the floor}} in a coughing fit and loss of breath". Shana Narula, the campaign's coordinator, said: The whole concept is to use Jeff and the hashtag #JeffWeCan and #StopMarlboro to show that these marketing tactics are not allowed and tobacco is still the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the world. And the fact is it's the only consumer product that when used as intended, it kills its user. This is very, very unique — no other consumer product does this. <b>Most</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> that tobacco is not really an issue in this country anymore and that's completely not true. That's what we want to shed light on today, in a fashion where people will take notice.|$|E

Ebony Michael A.

[...] It can actually be subdivided into multiple parts. [...] Most significantly, Minneapolis and neighboring Saint Paul (actually, the suburb of Falcon Heights) each have distinct campuses. [...] The Minneapolis and St. Paul campuses are connected via a dedicated bus transitway.

2500|$|While {{millions}} {{of tons of}} elemental hydrogen are distributed around the world each year in various ways, bringing hydrogen to individual consumers would require an evolution of the fuel infrastructure. [...] For example, according to GM, 70% of the U.S. population lives near a hydrogen-generating facility but has little public access to that hydrogen. [...] The same study however, shows that building the infrastructure in a systematic way is much more doable and affordable than <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>think.</b> For example, one article has noted that hydrogen stations could be put within every 10 miles in metro Los Angeles, and on the highways between LA and neighboring cities like Palm Springs, Las Vegas, San Diego and Santa Barbara, for the cost of a Starbuck's latte for every one of the 15 million residents living in these areas.|$|E

2500|$|Canzone Napoletana is what <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> of {{when they}} think of Neapolitan music. It {{consists}} of {{a large body of}} composed popular music—such songs as [...] 'O sole mio, Torna a Surriento, Funiculì funiculà, etc. The Neapolitan song became a formal institution in the 1830s through the vehicle of an annual song writing competition for the yearly Festival of Piedigrotta, dedicated to the Madonna of Piedigrotta, a well-known church in the Mergellina area of Naples. The winner of the first festival was a song entitled Te voglio bene assaie; it was composed by the prominent opera composer, Gaetano Donizetti. The festival ran regularly until 1950 when it was abandoned. A subsequent Festival of Neapolitan Song on Italian state radio enjoyed some success in the 1950s but was eventually abandoned as well. The period since 1950 has produced such songs as Malafemmena by Totò, Indifferentemente by Mario Trevi and Carmela by Sergio Bruni. [...] Although separated by some decades from the earlier classics of this genre, they have now become [...] "classics" [...] in their own right. (See main article for more information.) ...|$|E

2500|$|On 24 July, the Serbian government, expecting an Austrian {{declaration}} of war the next day, mobilized while Austria broke off diplomatic relations. The British Ambassador to Austria-Hungary reported to London: [...] "War is thought imminent. Wildest enthusiasm prevails in Vienna." [...] Asquith {{wrote in a letter}} to Venetia Stanley that he was worried that:"Russia is trying to drag us in. The news this morning is that Serbia had capitulated on the main points, but it is very doubtful if any reservations will be accepted by Austria, who is resolved upon a complete and final humiliation. The curious thing is that on many, if not most of the points, Austria has a good and Serbia a very bad case. But the Austrians are quite the stupidest people in Europe (as the Italians are the most perfidious), and there is a brutality about their mode of procedure, which will make <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> that is a case of a big Power wantonly bullying a little one. Anyhow, it is the most dangerous situation of the last 40 years." [...] In order to stop a war, the Permanent Secretary of the British Foreign Office, Sir Arthur Nicolson, suggested again that a conference be held in London chaired by Britain, Germany, Italy and France to resolve the dispute between Austria and Serbia.|$|E
