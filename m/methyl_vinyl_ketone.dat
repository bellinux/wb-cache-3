40|$|Modest basis set level MP 2 / 6 - 31 G(d,p) {{calculations}} on the Diels-Alder {{addition of}} S- 1 -alkyl- 1 -hydroxy-but- 3 -en- 2 -ones (1 -hydroxy- 1 -alkyl <b>methyl</b> <b>vinyl</b> <b>ketones)</b> to cyclopentadiene correctly reproduce the trends in known experimental endo/exo and diastereoface selectivity. B 3 LYP theoretical results {{at the same}} or significantly higher basis set level, on the other hand, do not satisfactorily model observed endo/exo selectivities and are thus unsuitable for quantitative studies. The same is valid also with regard to subtle effects originating from, for example, conformational distributions of reactants. The latter shortcomings are not alleviated {{by the fact that}} observed diastereoface selectivities are well-reproduced by DFT calculations. Quantitative computational studies of large cycloaddition systems would require higher basis sets and better account for electron correlation than MP 2, such as, for example, CCSD. Presently, however, with 30 or more non-hydrogen atoms, these computations are hardly feasible. We present quantitatively correct stereochemical predictions using a hybrid layered ONIOM computational approach, including the chiral carbon atom and the intramolecular hydrogen bond into a higher level, MP 2 / 6 - 311 G(d,p) or CCSD/ 6 - 311 G(d,p), layer. Significant computational economy is achieved by taking account of surrounding bulky (alkyl) residues at 6 - 31 G(d) in a low HF theoretical level layer. We conclude that theoretical calculations based on explicit correlated MO treatment of the reaction site are sufficiently reliable for the prediction of both endo/exo and diastereoface selectivity of Diels-Alder addition reactions. This is in line with the understanding of endo/exo selectivity originating from dynamic electron correlation effects of interacting π fragments and diastereofacial selectivity originating from steric interactions of fragments outside of the Diels-Alder reaction site...|$|R

40|$|Proline in the {{presence}} of sodium hydrogen carbonate {{has been found to be}} an effective catalyst for the Baylis–Hillman reaction between <b>methyl</b> or ethyl <b>vinyl</b> <b>ketone</b> and aryl aldehydes. Screening of several amine catalysts showed that an ionizable carboxylic function directly linked to the secondary amine catalyst plays an important role in the synthesis of the desired product in good yield. The data obtained has allowed us to suggest, for the first time, that proline, sarcosine, pipecolinic acid and homoproline may act as bifunctional catalysts via a bicyclic enaminolactone species as intermediate. Quantum-mechanical calculations (PM 3 /COSMO and ab initio 3 - 21 G/COSMO) support this mechanism and give more insight into the role of hydrogen carbonate...|$|R
40|$|The {{miscibility}} and phase {{behavior of}} poly(4 -vinylphenol) (PVPh) with poly(vinyl methyl ketone) (PVMK) was investigated by {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was shown that all blends of PVPh/PVMK are totally miscible. A DSC study showed the apparition of a single glass transition (Tg) over their entire composition range. When the amount of PVPh exceeds 50 % in blends, the obtained Tgs {{are found to be}} significantly higher than those observed for each individual component of the mixture, indicating that these blends are capable of forming interpolymer complexes. FTIR analysis revealed the existence of preferential specific interactions via hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups, which intensified when the amount of PVPh was increased in blends. Furthermore, the quantitative FTIR study carried out for PVPh/PVMK blends was also performed for the vinylphenol (VPh) and <b>vinyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> (VMK) functional groups.

40|$|Rat ovarian 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid {{dehydrogenase}} plays {{a pivotal}} role in leuteolysis and parturition by catalysing the reduction of progesterone to give the progestationally inactive steroid 20 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone. Putative mechanism based inhibitors of this enzyme were synthesized as potential progestational maintaining agents, including the epimeric allylic alcohol pair 3 beta-hydroxy-alpha-vinyl- 5 alpha-androstane- 17 beta-methanol and the related <b>vinyl</b> <b>ketone</b> 1 -(3 beta-hydroxy- 5 alpha-androstan- 17 beta-yl) - 2 -propen- 1 -one. The <b>vinyl</b> <b>ketone</b> inactivates rat ovarian 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, semi-purified by poly(L-lysine) -agarose column chromatography, in a rapid time-dependent manner. Analysis of the pseudo-first-order inactivation plots gave a Ki of 2. 0 microM for the inhibitor and a t 1 / 2 for the enzyme of 20 s at saturation. These data indicate that the <b>vinyl</b> <b>ketone</b> is a potent and efficient inactivator of the ovarian dehydrogenase. Neither dialysis in {{the presence or absence of}} a competing nucleophile nor gel filtration reserves the inactivation, suggesting that a stable covalent bond is formed between the enzyme and steroid ligand. Both substrates (20 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone and NADP+) protect the enzyme from inactivation; moreover, initial velocity measurements in the presence of saturating concentrations of both substrates indicate that the <b>vinyl</b> <b>ketone</b> can behave as a competitive inhibitor, yielding a Ki value identical with that obtained in the inactivation experiments. Our results imply that the <b>vinyl</b> <b>ketone</b> is an active-site directed alkylating agent. By contrast the allylic alcohol pair 3 beta-hydroxy-alpha-vinyl- 5 alpha-androstane- 17 beta-methanol are neither substrates nor inhibitors of the ovarian enzyme and appear to be excluded from the catalytic site. The rapid inactivation observed with the <b>vinyl</b> <b>ketone</b> suggests that this compound may be useful as a progestational maintaining agent...|$|R

40|$|A major {{component}} of the sex pheromone from the tobacco budworm moth Heliothis virescens is a C 16 straight-chain aldehyde with a single unsaturation at the eleventh position. The sex pheromones are inactivated when metabolized to their corresponding acids by insect aldehyde dehydrogenase. During this investigation it was demonstrated that the C 16 aldehyde is a good substrate for human aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1. 2. 1. 3) isoenzymes E 1 and E 2 with Km and Kcat. values at pH 7. 0 of 2 microM and 0. 4 mumol of NADH/min per mg and of 0. 6 microM and 0. 24 mumol of NADH/min per mg respectively. A <b>vinyl</b> <b>ketone</b> analogue of the pheromone inhibited insect pheromone metabolism; it also inactivated human aldehyde dehydrogenase. Total inactivation of both isoenzymes was achieved at stoichiometric (equal or less than the subunit number) concentrations of <b>vinyl</b> <b>ketone,</b> incorporating 2. 1 - 2. 6 molecules/molecule of enzyme. Substrate protection was observed {{in the presence of}} the parent aldehyde and 5 '-AMP. Peptide maps of tryptic digests of the E 2 isoenzyme modified with 3 H-labelled <b>vinyl</b> <b>ketone</b> showed that incorporation occurred into a single peptide peak. The labelled peptide of E 2 isoenzyme was further purified on h. p. l. c. and sequenced. The label was incorporated into cysteine- 302 in the primary structure of E 2 isoenzyme, thus indicating that cysteine- 302 is located in the aldehyde substrate area of the active site of aldehyde dehydrogenase.

50|$|Other {{mechanisms}} by which torquoselectivity can operate include chiral Lewis acid catalysts, induction via neighboring stereocenters (in which case the torquoselectivity {{is a case of}} diastereoselectivity), and axial-to-tetrahedral chirality transfer.
