40|$|Background & Objectives: Fair {{distribution}} of healthcare personnel improves the society healthcare indicators. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the geographical {{distribution of}} <b>medical</b> <b>specialists,</b> based on their field of specialty, in Iran. Methods: The present research was a descriptive and cross- sectional study. Data related to the country population and the number of <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> working in hospitals affiliated to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education in each province were gathered from the reports of 2011 national census population and housing performed by Iran national statistics center. Data was analyzed through Excel software. Lorenz curve was drawn and Gini index was calculated. Results: There were 21. 45 <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> per 100, 000 population in Iran in 2011. Semnan had the highest (40. 23) and North Khorasan had the lowest (11. 7) <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> in the country. Gini index for <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> was calculated as 0. 043. The greatest Gini index was observed for Neuropsychologists (0. 080) and the smallest was seen for dermatologists (0. 001). Conclusion: Although the ratio of <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> to the population differed in provinces of Iran, <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> were distributed fairly among provinces. It is recommended that in addition to distribution equity, policy makers pay more attention to the population medical needs in each region.

40|$|Abstract Background An {{increasing}} number of <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> prefer to work part-time. This development can be found worldwide. Problems to be faced in the realization of part-time work in medicine include the division of night and weekend shifts, as well as communication between physicians and continuity of care. People {{tend to think that}} physicians working part-time are less devoted to their work, implying that full-time physicians complete a greater number of tasks. The central question in this article is whether part-time <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> allocate their time differently to their tasks than full-time <b>medical</b> <b>specialists.</b> Methods A questionnaire was sent by mail to all internists (N = 817), surgeons (N = 693) and radiologists (N = 621) working in general hospitals in the Netherlands. Questions were asked about the actual situation, such as hours worked and night and weekend shifts. The response was 53 % (n = 411) for internists, 52 % (n = 359) for surgeons, and 36 % (n = 213) for radiologists. Due to non-response on specific questions there were 367 internists, 316 surgeons, and 71 radiologists included in the analyses. Multilevel analyses were used to analyze the data. Results Part-time <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> do not spend proportionally more time on direct patient care. With respect to night and weekend shifts, part-time <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> account for proportionally more or an equal share of these shifts. The number of hours worked per FTE is higher for part-time than for full-time <b>medical</b> <b>specialists,</b> although this difference is only significant for surgeons. Conclusion In general, part-time <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> do their share of the job. However, we focussed on input only. Besides input, output like the numbers of services provided deserves attention as well. The trend in medicine towards more part-time work has an important consequence: more <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> are needed to get the work done. Therefore, a greater number of <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> have to be trained. Part-time work is not only a female concern; there are also (international) trends for male <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> that show a {{decline in the number of}} hours worked. This indicates an overall change in attitudes towards the number of hours <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> should work. </p...|$|R
25|$|The mean {{annual salary}} of a <b>medical</b> <b>specialist</b> is $175,011 in the US, and $272,000 for surgeons. However, because of {{commodity}} inflation, increasing negligent costs, steep price rise of rental, the annual salary {{range of a}} <b>medical</b> <b>specialist</b> varies and is not rising as fast as other professional pay. Often, especially in the United States, physicians practice in groups of specialists within a particular medical specialty. These practice groups are often formed to help reach economies of scales in rental, insurance and staff costs {{as well as other}} benefits of practicing with other professionals and are typically governed by various legal documents.|$|E

The questions addressed in this study are whether part-time <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> allocate theirtime differently to their tasks than full-time <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> and whether there are differences in production between partnerships with and without part-time specialists. Methods: A first questionnaire was sent by mail to all internists (N = 817), surgeons (N = 693) and radiologists (N = 621) working in general hospitals in The Netherlands. Questions were asked about the actual situation, such as hours worked and night and weekend shifts. The response was 53 % (n = 411) for internists, 52 % (n = 359) for surgeons, and 36 % (n = 213) for radiologists. A second questionnaire was sent by mail to partnerships of internists (N = 118), partnerships of surgeons, (N= 109) and partnerships of radiologists (N= 120). Questions were asked about production. The response was 36 % (n = 42) for partnerships of internists, 41 % (n = 45) for partnerships of surgeons, and 28 % (n = 33) for partnerships of radiologists. Multilevel analyses were used to analyse most of the data. Results: For none of the medical specialties in this study did we find that part-time <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> spend more time on direct patient care. With respect to night and weekend shifts we found that part-time <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> account for proportionally more or an equal share of these shifts. The number of hours worked per FTE is higher for part-time than for full-time <b>medical</b> <b>specialists,</b> although this difference is only significant for surgeons. Only for part-time working radiologists the number of hours worked per FTE is higher when the percentage of full-time <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> in the partnership is higher. Preliminary results with respect to production show no difference between partnerships withand without part-time working specialists. Conclusions: In general, part-time <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> do their share of the job.

40|$|Objective: Stepwise {{description}} {{of the development of}} a post-graduate communication skills training programme for <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> focused on patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS) to improve specialist interaction with MUPS patients. Methods: Using the ‘intervention mapping approach’ we accomplished a needs assessment (literature study and pilot) to formulate intervention objectives and identify methods and techniques for a MUPS-focused communication skills training programme for <b>medical</b> <b>specialists.</b> Results: A 14 -h training programme which consists of experiential learning, role-play and feedback. Using skills from Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> are stimulated to explore interrelating factors that reinforce symptoms, to reassure patients effectively and to provide plausible and understandable explanations for MUPS. Dealing with complex referrals and informing GPs properly are also practiced. Conclusion: By applying the ‘intervention mapping approach’ we were able to create a feasible and promising intervention to improve specialist interaction with MUPS patients. Intervention effects are currently being assessed in a randomized controlled trial. Practice implications: If the RCT demonstrates sufficient effectiveness and efficiency of the MUPS focused communication skills training programme for <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> the intervention could be embedded in post-graduate education of <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> and residents.

Design Consultations of <b>medical</b> <b>specialists</b> with cancer outpatients were videotaped at 4 specific stages, 2 before and 2 after Interact-Cancer, with intervals of 4 weeks. Patients/participants Participants were 21 <b>medical</b> <b>specialists,</b> mainly internists, working in 7 hospitals, and 385 cancer outpatients.
