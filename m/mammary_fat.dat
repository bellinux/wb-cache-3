Studies conducted using breast cancer cell lines have demonstrated that AhR agonists suppress proliferation, invasiveness, and colony forma-tion in vitro; however, further exploration using in vivo models of metastasis is warranted. To test the effect of AhR activation on metastasis, 4 T 1. 2 mammary tumor cells were injected into the <b>mammary</b> gland <b>fat</b> pad of syngeneic Balb/c mice treated with 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD).

40|$|Canonical Wnt {{signals are}} transduced through a Frizzled {{receptor}} and either the LRP 5 or LRP 6 co-receptor; such signals play central roles during development and in disease. We have previously shown that Lrp 5 {{is required for}} ductal stem cell activity and that loss of Lrp 5 delays normal mammary development and Wnt 1 -induced tumorigenesis. Here we show that canonical Wnt signals through the Lrp 6 co-receptor are also required for normal mouse mammary gland development. Loss of Lrp 6 compromises Wnt/b-catenin signaling and interferes with <b>mammary</b> placode, <b>fat</b> pad, and branching development during embryogenesis. Heterozygosity for an inactivating mutation in Lrp 6 {{is associated with a}} reduced number of terminal end buds and branches during postnatal development. While Lrp 6 is expressed in both the basal and luminal mammary epithelium during embryogenesis, Lrp 6 expression later becomes restricted to cells residing in the basal epithelial layer. Interestingly, these cells also express mammary stem cell markers. In humans, increased Lrp 6 expression is associated with basal-like breast cancer. Taken together, our results suggest both overlapping and specific functions for Lrp 5 and Lrp 6 in the mammary gland...|$|R

50|$|Mutations in the ferroportin gene {{are known}} to cause an {{autosomal}} dominant form of iron overload known as type IV haemochromatosis or Ferroportin Disease. The effects of the mutations are generally not severe but a spectrum of clinical outcomes are seen with different mutations. Ferroportin is also associated with African iron overload. Ferroportin and hepcidin are critical proteins for the regulation of systemic iron homeostasis. Both ferroportin and hepcidin are expressed in cultured human breast epithelial cells, and hepcidin regulates ferroportin in these cells. Transfection of breast cancer cells with ferroportin significantly reduces their growth after orthotopic implantation in the mouse <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad. Therefore, ferroportin is a pivotal protein in breast biology and a strong and independent predictor of prognosis in breast cancer.|$|E
50|$|The {{quantitative}} lineage-tracing {{strategies have}} proven to be successful in resolving cell fates in normal epithelial tissues either using tissue -specific or stem-cell-specific transgenes. To conduct an inducible lineage-tracing experiment two components must be engineered into the mouse genome: a switch and a reporter. The switch is commonly a drug-regulated form of the bacterial enzyme Cre-recombinase. This enzyme recognizes specific sequences, called LoxP sites. Proteins that are capable of enhancing the identification of labeled cells or a specific population in unlabelled cells are encoded by the reporter transgenes. After harvesting all the ten mouse mammary glands from the transgenic mice, single cell suspension is usually made and transplanted either in tail vein of non transgenic recipient mice or in cleared fat pad of non-transgenic mice repopulating the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad. These cells are then followed in the blood stream, lungs, bone marrow and liver to look for the favorable site of metastasis.these transgenic cells can be traced according to their special features of either fluorescence or induced by placing the recipients on doxycycline food.|$|E
40|$|Our {{meta-analysis}} {{was aimed}} at providing a systematic {{review of the literature}} regarding the effect of energy restriction on spontaneous mammary tumors in mice and at providing a more precise pooled (summary) estimate of the risk of mammary tumors. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to obtain insight in potential heterogeneity between the animal studies. A literature search was conducted with the following terms to identify relevant articles: animal studies, <b>mammary</b> tumors, <b>fat</b> restricted, dietary carbohydrates, energy restriction and calorie restriction. A criteria list for the assessment of quality items (i. e., study characteristics) in animal experiments was developed that was intended to quantitatively assess potential factors that underlie heterogeneous results of different animal experiments. Incidence figures were used to calculate the risk difference. The pooled risk difference was calculated by random effects meta regression analysis. Fourteen animal experiments were included in this meta-analysis. Publication bias could not be identified. The pooled risk difference for the 14 studies was - 0. 55 with a narrow 95 % confidence interval (- 0. 69; - 0. 41), implying that the energy-restricted animal groups developed 55 % less mammary tumors than the control groups. No heterogeneity could be detected between the studies based on study characteristics that included the age of mice at the start of intervention, duration of intervention, allocation of the mice, use of ad libitum control group, fertility of the mice and the type of energy-providing nutrient (fat, carbohydrate or protein). This meta-analysis confirms that energy restriction in itself consistently protects against the development of mammary tumor in mice, irrespective of the type of restricted nutrient or other study characteristics. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{describe}} the radiological appearance of normal and pathological findings resulting from <b>mammary</b> autologous <b>fat</b> injections (lipofilling). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Informed consent and {{institutional review board}} approval were obtained. From January 2008 to December 2010, all patients that had undergone breast lipofilling at our institution (Catholic University) were consecutively enrolled. The site and amount of autologous fat injections were known. Mammography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were prospectively obtained preoperatively, and 6 and 12 months after the procedure. Normal and pathological findings were described. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (mean age 50. 8  ±  10. 5 years; range 26 - 70 years) were included. Fourteen patients underwent lipofilling after mastectomy, eight after wide local excision, one {{as a treatment for}} a congenital asymmetry, and one as a treatment for Poland syndrome. No severe complications were observed after treatment. Normal findings due to lipofilling ("oil cysts") were identified in 23 cases using ultrasound and in 16 using MRI. Liponecrosis, the most frequently observed complication, was detected in four cases using ultrasound and in eight by MRI. In one case mammography showed calcific fat necrosis. Mean amount of fat injected was 114. 8  ±  55  ml. The average amount of fat grafted in patients who developed liponecrosis was 158. 4  ±  42. 7 versus 104. 6  ±  52. 3  ml (p =  0. 0043, t-test). In one case breast cancer recurrence was diagnosed. CONCLUSION: Normal findings due to lipofilling are better identified by ultrasound, and pathological findings are best identified using MRI. Liponecrosis most frequently occurs when large amounts of fat are injected. In the authors' experience lipofilling does not interfere with breast cancer early diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{transcription}} factor CCAAT enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα) is expressed {{at high levels}} in liver and adipose tissue. Cell culture studies show that C/EBPα is sufficient to trigger differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, suggesting a central role for C/EBPα {{in the development of}} adipose tissue. C/EBPα knockout mice die within 7 – 12 h after birth. Defective gluconeogenesis of the liver and subsequent hypoglycemia contribute to the early death of these animals. This short life span impairs investigation of the development of adipose tissue in these mice. To improve the survival of C/EBPα−/− animals, we generated a transgenic line that expresses C/EBPα {{under the control of the}} albumin enhancer/promoter. This line was bred into the knockout strain to generate animals that express C/EBPα in the liver but in no other tissue. The presence of the transgene improved survival of C/EBPα−/− animals almost 3 -fold. Transgenic C/EBPα−/− animals at 7 days of age show an absence of s. c., perirenal, and epididymal white fat despite excess lipid substrate in the serum, whereas brown adipose tissue is somewhat hypertrophied and shows minimal biochemical alterations. Interestingly, <b>mammary</b> gland <b>fat</b> tissue is present and exhibits normal morphology. The absence of white adipose tissue in many depots in the presence of high serum lipid levels shows that C/EBPα is required for the in vivo development of this tissue. In contrast, brown adipose tissue differentiation is independent of C/EBPα expression. The presence of lipid in brown adipose tissue serves as an internal nutritional control, indicating that neither nutritional intake nor lipoprotein composition is likely responsible for the absence of white fat...|$|R
50|$|Estrogen {{and growth}} hormone (GH) are {{essential}} for the ductal component of mammary gland development, and act synergistically to mediate it. Neither estrogen nor GH are capable of inducing ductal development without the other. The role of GH in ductal development {{has been found to}} be mostly mediated by its induction of the secretion of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which occurs both systemically (mainly originating from the liver) and locally in the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad through activation of the growth hormone receptor (GHR). However, GH itself also acts independently of IGF-1 to stimulate ductal development by upregulating estrogen receptor (ER) expression in mammary gland tissue, which is a downstream effect of mammary gland GHR activation. In any case, unlike IGF-1, GH itself is not essential for mammary gland development, and IGF-1 in conjunction with estrogen can induce normal mammary gland development without the presence of GH. In addition to IGF-1, other paracrine growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), amphiregulin, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) are involved in breast development as mediators downstream to sex hormones and GH/IGF-1.|$|E
50|$|In {{women with}} Laron syndrome, where the growth hormone {{receptor}} (GHR) is defective and insensitive to GH and serum IGF-1 levels are very low, puberty, including breast development, is delayed, although full sexual maturity is always eventually reached. Moreover, breast development and size are normal (albeit delayed) {{in spite of}} GH/IGF-1 axis insufficiency, and in some the breasts may actually be large in relation to body size (which has been hypothesized {{to be due to}} increased secretion of prolactin caused by a drift phenomenon from somatomammotrophic cells in the pituitary gland with a high GH secretion). An animal model of Laron syndrome, the GHR knockout mouse, shows severely impaired ductal outgrowth at 11 weeks of age. However, by 15 weeks, ductal development has caught up with that of normal mice and the ducts have fully distributed throughout the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad, although the ducts remain narrower than those of wild-type mice. In any case, female GHR knockout mice can lactate normally. As such, taken together, it is said that the phenotypes of women with Laron syndrome and GHR knockout mice are identical, with diminished body size and delayed sexual maturation accompanied by normal lactation.|$|E

Cell surface progenitor-associated markers are rapidly induced in normal mouse ME-CRCs relative to ME cells. However, {{the expression of}} certain mammary progenitor subpopulations, such as CD49f+ ESA+ CD44+, drops significantly in later passages. Nevertheless, mouse ME-CRCs grown in a three-dimensional extracellular matrix gave rise to mammary acinar structures. ME-CRCs isolated from MMTV-Neu transgenic mouse mammary tumors express high levels of HER2/neu, as well as tumor-initiating cell markers, such as CD44+, CD49f+ and ESA+ (EpCam). These patterns of expression are sustained in later CRC passages. Early and late passage ME-CRCs from MMTV-Neu tumors that were implanted in the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pads of syngeneic or nude mice developed vascular tumors that metastasized within 6 weeks of transplantation. Importantly, the histopathology of these tumors was indistinguishable {{from that of the}} parental tumors that develop in the MMTV-Neu mice. Application of the CRC system to mouse mammary epithelial cells provides an attractive model system to study the genetics and phenotype of normal and transformed mouse epithelium in a defined culture environment and in vivo transplant studies.|$|E

Our {{objective was to}} determine the effects of lipid-encapsulated CLA (LE-CLA) supplementation on milk production, reproductive performance and metabolic responses in lactating dairy cows fed a grass silage-based diet. Seventy-two Holstein-Friesian cows (32 primiparous and 40 multiparous) were used in a completely randomized block design. Cows received either 80 g of LE-CLA daily or 60 g of calcium salts of palm fatty acids daily (control) from parturition until 60 days in milk. LE-CLA contained a 50 : 50 mix of cis- 9,trans- 11 CLA and trans- 10,cis- 12 CLA, resulting in a daily intake of 6 g of each isomer. Milk production and dry matter intake were recorded daily, and blood samples were collected 3 -times a week. Blood samples were analysed for circulating concentrations of glucose, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Progesterone was measured in blood samples collected after the first post-partum insemination. Ovarian ultrasound examinations commenced at 8 – 10 d post partum and were carried out 3 -times a week until first ovulation. LE-CLA treatment resulted in decreased milk fat concentration, with consequent improvements in energy balance and body condition score (BCS). The peak concentration of NEFA in blood was reduced by LE-CLA, but circulating concentrations of insulin, glucose, IGF-I, BHBA and progesterone were not affected. There was no effect of LE-CLA supplementation on the post-partum interval to first ovulation. Services per conception tended to be reduced. The reduction in milk energy output and improvement in energy status and BCS in LE-CLA-supplemented cows provides a strong rationale for further studies with greater cow numbers to test effects on reproductive performance.

40|$|Eph {{receptor}} tyrosine kinases, including EphA 2, {{are expressed}} in the mammary gland. However, their role in mammary gland development remains poorly understood. Using EphA 2 -deficient animals, we demonstrate {{for the first time}} that EphA 2 receptor function is required for mammary epithelial growth and branching morphogenesis. Loss of EphA 2 decreased penetration of <b>mammary</b> epithelium into <b>fat</b> pad, reduced epithelial proliferation, and inhibited epithelial branching. These defects appear to be intrinsic to loss of EphA 2 in epithelium, as transplantation of EphA 2 -deficient mammary tissue into wild-type recipient stroma recapitulated these defects. In addition, HGF-induced mammary epithelial branching morphogenesis was significantly reduced in EphA 2 -deficient cells relative to wild-type cells, which correlated with elevated basal RhoA activity. Moreover, inhibition of ROCK kinase activity in EphA 2 -deficient mammary epithelium rescued branching defects in primary three-dimensional cultures. These results suggest that EphA 2 receptor acts as a positive regulator in mammary gland development, functioning downstream of HGF to regulate branching through inhibition of RhoA. Together, these data demonstrate a positive role for EphA 2 during normal mammary epithelial proliferation and branching morphogenesis...|$|R

Methylarsonate (MA) and dimethylarsinate (DMA) is not a favoured mechanism. The presence of high total As and high As(III) species content in the auricle and saphene of more contaminated people, the damage found in the saphene tissue and the global characteristics of the people under study in which the As stigmas are present in all of them, suggests that As could be involved in the cardiovascular diseases...|$|R
50|$|Now {{with one}} single local {{application}} using hydrogel scaffolds embedded with a 2-pair FRET/NSET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer/NanoSurface Energy Transfer) gold nanobeacons (also known as dark-gold nanobeacons) {{we are able}} to overcome drug resistance by detecting and silencing a multidrug resistance protein (MRP1), before chemotherapeutic drug delivery in vivo. Our platform contains hydrogel embedded with dark-gold nanoparticles modified with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-intercalated nanobeacons that serve as an ON/OFF molecular nanoswitch triggered by the increased MRP1 expression within the tumour tissue microenvironment. This nanoswitch can sense and overcome multidrug resistance (MDR) prior to local drug release. These nanoprobes comprise a thiol-DNA-hairpin labelled with a NIR dye and a thiol-DNA oligo labelled with a dark quencher (BHQ2), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and intercalated drug- all of which are conjugated to a gold nanoparticle core. These dark-gold nanobeacons are then loaded with 5-FU that intercalates in the beacon stem (dsDNA part) of the DNA-hairpin oligo. Under hairpin configuration, the proximity of the NIR dye to the dark quencher leads to fluorescence quenching. Hybridization of the DNA hairpin to a complementary mRNA target restores fluorescence emission due to the gold nanobeacons' conformational reorganization that causes the fluorophore and the quencher to part from each other, yielding a quantitative response. On the other hand, the release of the 5-FU drug can only occur when DNA hairpin hybridizes with the complementary target and can be measured once the distance from the 5-FU and the gold core increases, escalating the drug emission.To evaluate the efficiency of the dark-gold nanobeacon probes in sensing and in overcoming MDR in vivo, an orthotopic breast cancer mouse model was developed by injecting 5-FU resistant MDAMB-231 cells to the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad of female SCID hairless congenic mice. Efficacious and local delivery of the dark-gold nanobeacon probes is achieved by the implantation of a hydrogel disk on top of the triple-negative breast tumours using a polyamidoamine (PAMAM G5) dendrimer cross-linked with dextran aldehyde, which provides enhanced stability of the embedded nanoparticles. Despite the cross-resistance to 5-FU, more than 90% tumour reduction is achieved in vivo, following 80% MRP1 silencing compared with the continuous tumour growth following only drug or nonsense nanobeacon administration.|$|E

40|$|Development of {{the female}} mammary gland {{involves}} the proliferation and morphogenesis of epithelial cells within a matrix of adipose and connective tissue which constitutes the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad. The objective {{of this research was}} to investigate the mechanisms by which this stromal environment locally regulates postnatal mammogenesis. Initial experiments showed that the mouse <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad liberates a diffusible activity in vitro which stimulates the growth of mouse mammary epithelial cells and enhances their proliferative response to insulin-like growth factor-I, epidermal growth factor and insulin. This effect was specific to these mitogens, and of a variety of cell lines tested was most pronounced for mouse mammary epithelial cells. Subsequent investigations indicated that these responses were likely induced by unsaturated fatty acids, particularly linoleic acid, from mammary adipocytes. Such responses may be effected by increased intracellular signalling via the actions of protein kinase C. The mitogenic capacity of the mouse <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad was also evaluated across several physiological states. <b>Mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad-stimulated proliferation during the estrus cycle was increased at estrus concomitant with a phase of ductal elongation in vivo. In certain medium treatments there was evidence for epithelial upregulation of the mitogenic effect of the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad, where intact mammary tissue was more stimulatory than <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad cleared of endogenous epithelium. Further experiments demonstrated that while the mitogenic effect of the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad was unaltered by ovariectomy, ovarian function was required for this effect to be increased by exogenous progesterone. The effect of estrogen was independent of ovarian function but was altered by the local epithelial-stromal interaction, where it increased the mitogenic effect of epithelium-free <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad and decreased that of intact mammary tissue. Mitogenic stimulation by mammary tissues also declined during virginal development to be least in mature virgin and mid-pregnant states. Stimulation by intact mammary tissue increased during lactation, while that from epithelium-free <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad remained constant in the presence of steroid hormones and increased in the presence of growth factors. Further experiments investigated the stromal regulation of epithelial growth within the ruminant mammary gland. Differences between the ruminant and rodent <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad were emphasised in vitro where ovine <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad stimulated the growth of mouse mammary epithelial cells but did not markedly potentiate their growth factor-responsiveness. A subsequent study examined the expression of stroma-derived growth factors within the ruminant mammary gland during postnatal development, and their regulation by several physiological influences. The level of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) -I mRNA in the ovine <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad was elevated prior to puberty and during late gestation, while IGF-II mRNA was upregulated in mammary parenchyma of virgin ewes in a transcript-specific manner. Abundance of IGF-I mRNA in mammary tissues of prepubertal ewe lambs tended to be increased by exogenous estrogen whereas IGF-II mRNA levels were reduced. Messenger RNA for keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) was detected within the ovine <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad throughout development as 2. 4 and 1. 5 kb mRNA transcripts which were expressed by stromal adipocytes and fibroblasts, respectively. The level of KGF mRNA in mammary tissues of prepubertal lambs was increased by ovariectomy and decreased by estrogen, while KGF mRNA expression in cultures of mammary fibroblasts was suppressed by dexamethasone. Messenger RNA for hepatocyte growth factor, a paracrine mitogen and morphogen for mammary epithelial cells, was expressed in the ovine <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad and by cultured mammary fibroblasts. The abundance of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) mRNA was highest within the ovine <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad, while in vitro results suggest bFGF may be a paracrine/autocrine mitogen for multiple cell types within the mammary gland. Basic FGF gene expression in mammary tissues of prepubertal ewes was reduced by estrogen treatment. For each of these growth factors there was evidence suggesting that their expression within the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad was upregulated by the adjacent mammary epithelium. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad may stimulate the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells during postnatal mammogenesis by a variety of influences. Such mechanisms may involve the direct stimulation of epithelial growth or the modulation of epithelial responsiveness to other mitogens. These effects may function to mediate the actions of certain mammogenic hormones. Furthermore, strong evidence indicates that mammary growth may be locally regulated by the interaction between epithelial and stromal cells...|$|E

To identify these genes, 16 prepubertal heifers were used in a 2 X 2 factorial experiment, with ovarian status (intact or ovariectomized) as the first factor and estrogen treatment as the second (control or estradiol). Heifers were ovariectomized at similar to 4. 5 mo of age, and estrogen treatments were initiated 1 mo later. After 3 days of treatment, gene expression was analyzed in the parenchyma and fat pad of the bovine mammary gland using a high-density oligonucleotide microarray. Oligonucelotide probes represented 40, 808 tentative consensus sequences from TIGR Bos taurus Gene Index and 4, 575 singleton expressed sequence tags derived from libraries of pooled mammary gland and gut tissues. Microarray data were analyzed by use of the SAS mixed procedure, with an experiment-wide permutation-based significance level of P < 0. 1. Considerable differences in basal gene expression were noted between <b>mammary</b> parenchyma and <b>fat</b> pad. A total of 124 estrogen-responsive genes were identified, with most responding only in the parenchyma or the fat pad. The majority of genes identified were not previously reported to be estrogen responsive.

The oPL cDNA fragment amplified {{between these}} two primers extended from A(- 1) to the natural stop codon. The PCR product was gel-purified and subcloned into a Puc vector and the insert was sequenced on both strands, revealing several differences relative to the published sequence: S 19 N, S 69 N, D 129 E and R 165 Q. We assume that these differences can {{be accounted for by}} the high level of individual polymorphism, which has been described in detail for PLs of different species. The insert was subcloned into NcoI/PstI-digested pTrc 99 A procaryotic expression plasmid and protein expression was induced by isopropyl- 1 -thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. Because of low expression, oPL 2 ̆ 7 s cDNA was further subcloned into pET 8 procaryotic expression plasmid. Its expression in E. coli strain BL 21 transformed with this vector yielded 30 - 40 mg/l.

40|$|Milk {{production}} in ruminants necessitates renovation of least available plant materials into most enriched nutrients. This involves pregastric microbial rumen fermentation of plant cells {{and production of}} volatile fatty acids (VFA) as substrates for <b>mammary</b> milk lactose, <b>fat</b> and protein synthesis. Thus, milk contains numerous bioactive substances functioning beyond solely their nutritive value. Essential amino acids, specialized casein, lactalbumins and globulins, peptides, nucleosides, nucleotides, unsaturated fatty acids such as conjugated linoleic acids, sphingomyelins, fat soluble vitamins and minerals of mainly calcium are principal examples. Whey proteins are insulinotropic, medium chain fatty acids improve insulin sensitivity, and calcium favorably influences fat distribution. Peptides and calcium can reduce blood pressure and cholesterol. Dairy consumption benefits folate availability and lowers blood homocystein and heart attack risks. Very early (< 3 mo of age) neonatal cow milk intake has been related to insulin-dependent diabetes. Non- breast milk intake during early stages of life is unarguably uncommon. Modern nutrition does in no standard circumstances authorize feeding such quite young neonates non-breast milks. Milk sufficiency for neonatal brain, nervous and immune systems, and bone development and tissue growth for even up to 2 yr without major needs for alternative foods is an evolutionary verification for its irreplaceable role in human nutrition. However, the increasing concerns of cardiovascular disorders, hypertension, and related complexities in modern populations due to improper nutrition have contributed to forming a fallacious public perception about milk in general and milk fat in particular as a possible risk factor. Despite such a functional nature of milk in improving human health, the confusion exists where education is suboptimal. Insightful education on milk science must accompany research to enable the public to discern a pseudo- science that unconsciously disregards milk as an animal fat food with serious health risks.

40|$|Leptin, like estrogen, {{is one of}} the endo/paracrine factors, {{which are}} {{synthesized}} in and secreted from mature adipocytes. The roles of the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad and mammary adipocytes in the initiation of lactation are not clear. In this study, we showed that combination of prolactin, leptin and estrogen elevated the expression of the milk protein beta-lactoglobulin. We also showed that after prolactin stimulate the secretion of leptin from the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat,</b> leptin upregulated the expression of estrogen receptor alpha in the mammary epithelial cells. Also, prolactin affected aromatase mRNA expression in the bovine <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> and we demonstrated that leptin and prolactin can affect cholesterol secretion from explants in culture to the medium. Therefore, we suggest that prolactin initiates estrogen expression (as represented by aromatase mRNA) in the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad, whereas leptin stimulates estrogen receptor alpha expression in the mammary epithelial cells. We hypothesize that leptin and estrogen, secreted from the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> regulate lactation after stimulation of prolactin. Copyright © 2009 Yonatan Feuermann et al.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Disseminated {{tumor cells}} (DTCs) {{in the bone}} marrow may exist in a dormant state for {{extended}} periods of time, maintaining the ability to proliferate upon activation, engraft at new sites, and form detectable metastases. However, understanding of the behavior and biology of dormant breast cancer cells in the bone marrow niche remains limited, {{as well as their}} potential involvement in tumor recurrence and metastasis. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate the tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of dormant disseminated breast cancer cells (prior to activation) in the bone marrow. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Total bone marrow, isolated from mice previously injected with tumorspheres into the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad, was injected into the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad of NUDE mice. As a negative control, bone marrow isolated from non-injected mice was injected into the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad of NUDE mice. The resultant tumors were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers. Mouse lungs, livers, and kidneys were analyzed by H+E staining to detect metastases. The injection of bone marrow isolated from mice previously injected with tumorspheres into the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad, resulted in large tumor formation in the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad 2 months post-injection. However, the injection of bone marrow isolated from non-injected mice did not result in tumor formation in the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad. The DTC-derived tumors exhibited accelerated development of metastatic lesions within the lung, liver and kidney. The resultant tumors and the majority of metastatic lesions within the lung and liver exhibited a mesenchymal-like phenotype. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Dormant DTCs within the bone marrow are highly malignant upon injection into the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad, with the accelerated development of metastatic lesions within the lung, liver and kidney. These results suggest the acquisition of a more aggressive phenotype of DTCs during metastatic latency within the bone marrow microenvironment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{mammary gland}} {{is unique in}} its {{requirement}} to develop in close association with a depot of adipose tissue that is {{commonly referred to as}} the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad. As discussed throughout this issue, the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad represents a complex stromal microenvironment that includes a variety of cell types. In this article we focus on adipocytes as local regulators of epithelial cell growth and their function during lactation. Several important considerations arise from such a discussion. There is a clear and close interrelationship between different stromal tissue types within the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad and its adipocytes. Furthermore, these relationships are both stage- and species-dependent, although many questions remain unanswered regarding their roles in these different states. Several lines of evidence also suggest that adipocytes within the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad may function differently from those in other fat depots. Finally, past and future technologies present a variety of opportunities to model these complexities in order to more precisely delineate the many potential functions of adipocytes within the mammary glands. A thorough understanding of the role for this cell type in the mammary glands could present numerous opportunities to modify both breast cancer risk and lactation performance...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate the effects of trans- 10,cis- 12 and cis- 9,trans- 11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) supplementation on body composition, mobilization or accretion of body fat and protein mass, as well as the energy metabolism of dairy cows during the first 105 d in milk (DIM). For this purpose, a comparative slaughter experiment was conducted with 25 primiparous German Holstein cows. The experiment started at 1 DIM with the slaughter of 5 animals of an initial group receiving no CLA supplement. The remaining animals were fed a CLA supplement (n= 10) or a stearic acid-based control fat supplement (CON; n= 10) from 1 DIM up to slaughter. After 42 DIM, 5 more cows from each treatment (42 -CLA and 42 -CON) were slaughtered. The remaining 5 cows in each treatment were slaughtered after 105 DIM (105 -CLA and 105 -CON). The animals of the CLA groups consumed 6. 0 g/d of trans- 10,cis- 12 CLA and 5. 7 g/d of cis- 9,trans- 11 CLA. During the slaughter process, the empty body mass was recorded and partitioned into 9 fractions (meat, bone, offal, hide, <b>mammary</b> gland, retroperitoneal <b>fat,</b> omental fat, mesenteric fat, and s. c. fat). The fractions were analyzed for dry matter, ether extract, crude protein, and ash to calculate the body composition of the empty body mass at the different slaughter times. The principle of the comparative slaughter technique was applied to estimate body fat or protein mobilization and accretion in the viewed periods from 1 DIM until 42 and 105 DIM. The heat production (HP) was calculated by subtracting the energy in milk and energy changes in body mass from the metabolizable energy intake. The body composition was not affected by CLA supplementation. However, the mobilization of body fat mass from 1 until 42 DIM was 24. 1 kg in the 42 -CON group and 14. 3 kg in the 42 -CLA group. This resulted in a trend to lower body mass (fat and protein) mobilization of 10. 5 kg in the 42 -CLA group. Energy mobilization from body mass was 21. 2 MJ/d in the 42 -CON and 11. 5 MJ/d in the 42 -CLA group. The HP was unchanged for the 42 -CON and 42 -CLA group with 123. 0 and 116. 9 MJ/d, respectively. From 1 until 105 DIM, the protein accretion was 4. 3 kg and the daily energy retention in body protein was 1. 0 MJ higher for CLA-supplemented cows. The HP was decreased in this period for the 105 -CLA group (115. 5 MJ/d) as compared with the 105 -CON group (125. 9 MJ/d). Overall, the trend for a decreased body mass mobilization suggested a protective effect of CLA supplementation against excessive use of body reserves within 42 DIM. Continuous CLA supplementation until 105 DIM increased protein accretion. The effects on body mass mobilization and protein accretion in combination with the decreased HP in the CLA-fed cows suggested a more efficient utilization of metabolizable energy in CLA-supplemented early lactation dairy cows...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Breast {{cancer is}} thought to arise in mammary {{epithelial}} stem cells. There is, therefore, {{a large amount of}} interest in identifying these cells. The breast is a complex tissue consisting of two epithelial layers (an outer myoepithelial/basal layer and an inner luminal epithelial layer) as well as a large non-epithelial component (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, lymphocytes, adipocytes, neurons and myocytes). The definitive identification of a mammary epithelial stem cell population is critically dependent on its purity. To date, this has been hampered by the lack of suitable markers to separate out the two epithelial layers, and to remove contaminating non-epithelial cells. Methods: Mouse mammary glands were dissociated and stained with CD 24. Cells were sorted into separate populations based on CD 24 expression and assessed for luminal epithelial and myoepithelial/basal markers by direct fluorescent microscopy and real time PCR. The stem/progenitor potential of these cell populations was assessed in vivo by cleared <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad transplantation. Results: Three populations of CD 24 expressing cells were identified: CD 24 Negative, CD 24 Low and CD 24 High. Staining of these cells with cytokeratin markers revealed that these populations correspond to non-epithelial, myoepithelial/basal and luminal epithelial cells, respectively. Cell identities were confirmed by quantitative PCR. Cleared <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad transplantation of these cell populations revealed that extensive <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad repopulation capacity segregates with the CD 24 Low cells, whilst CD 24 High cells have limited repopulation capacity. Conclusion: Differential staining of mammary epithelial cells for CD 24 can be used to simultaneously isolate pure populations of non-epithelial, myoepithelial/basal and luminal epithelial cells. Furthermore, <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad repopulation capacity is enriched in the CD 24 Low population. As separation is achieved using a single marker, {{it will be possible to}} incorporate additional markers to further subdivide these populations. This will considerably facilitate the further analysis of mammary epithelial subpopulations, whilst ensuring high purity, which is key for understanding mammary epithelial stem cells in normal tissue biology and carcinogenesis...|$|E

We used human breast cancer MDA-MB- 231 cells inoculated into the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad and left ventricle of BALB/c Nu/Nu mice, respectively, and spontaneously metastasizing 4 T 1. 2 -Luc mouse mammary cells inoculated into <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad of BALB/c mice. In a prevention setting, treatment with Cmpd- 1 markedly delayed the growth of primary tumors in both models, and reduced the onset and severity of osteolytic lesions in the MDA-MB- 231 intracardiac model. Intervention treatment with Cmpd- 1 on established MDA-MB- 231 primary tumors also significantly inhibited subsequent growth. In contrast, no effects of Cmpd- 1 were observed on soft organ metastatic burden following intracardiac or <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad inoculations of MDA-MB- 231 and 4 T 1. 2 -Luc cells respectively.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{study of}} breast cancer {{metastasis}} depends {{on the use of}} established breast cancer cell lines that do not accurately represent the heterogeneity and complexity of human breast tumors. A tumor model was developed using primary breast tumor-initiating cells isolated from patient core biopsies that would more accurately reflect human breast cancer metastasis. Methods Tumorspheres were isolated under serum-free culture conditions from core biopsies collected from five patients with clinical diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Isolated tumorspheres were transplanted into the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad of NUDE mice to establish tumorigenicity in vivo. Tumors and metastatic lesions were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin (H+E) staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results Tumorspheres were successfully isolated from all patient core biopsies, independent of the estrogen receptor α (ERα) /progesterone receptor (PR) /Her 2 /neu status or tumor grade. Each tumorsphere was estimated to contain 50 - 100 cells. Transplantation of 50 tumorspheres (1 - 5 × 10 3 cells) in combination with Matrigel into the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad of NUDE mice resulted in small, palpable tumors that were sustained up to 12 months post-injection. Tumors were serially transplanted three times by re-isolation of tumorspheres from the tumors and injection into the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad of NUDE mice. At 3 months post-injection, micrometastases to the lung, liver, kidneys, brain and femur were detected by measuring content of human chromosome 17. Visible macrometastases were detected in the lung, liver and kidneys by 6 months post-injection. Primary tumors variably expressed cytokeratins, Her 2 /neu, cytoplasmic E-cadherin, nuclear β catenin and fibronectin but were negative for ERα and vimentin. In lung and liver metastases, variable redistribution of E-cadherin and β catenin to the membrane of tumor cells was observed. ERα was re-expressed in lung metastatic cells in two of five samples. Conclusions Tumorspheres isolated under defined culture conditions from patient core biopsies were tumorigenic when transplanted into the <b>mammary</b> <b>fat</b> pad of NUDE mice, and metastasized to multiple mouse organs. Micrometastases in mouse organs demonstrated a dormancy period prior to outgrowth of macrometastases. The development of macrometastases with organ-specific phenotypic distinctions provides a superior model for the investigation of organ-specific effects on metastatic cancer cell survival and growth. </p...|$|E
