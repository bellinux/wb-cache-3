25|$|Pulse {{pressure}} (PP) methods {{measure the}} pressure in an artery over time to derive a waveform and use this information to calculate cardiac performance. However, any measure from the artery includes changes in pressure associated with changes in arterial function, for example compliance and impedance. Physiological or therapeutic changes in vessel diameter are assumed to reflect changes in Q. PP methods measure the combined performance {{of the heart and}} the blood vessels, thus limiting their application for measurement of Q. This can be partially compensated for by intermittent calibration of the waveform to another Q <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> then monitoring the PP waveform. Ideally, the PP waveform should be calibrated on a beat-to-beat basis. There are invasive and non-invasive methods of measuring PP.|$|E

500|$|Sea surface {{temperature}} (SST) is {{the water temperature}} close to the ocean's surface. [...] The exact meaning of surface varies according to the <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> used, but it is between [...] and [...] below the sea surface. [...] Air masses in the Earth's atmosphere are highly modified by sea {{surface temperature}}s within a short distance of the shore. [...] Localized areas of heavy snow can form in bands downwind of warm water bodies within an otherwise cold air mass. [...] Warm sea surface temperatures {{are known to be}} a cause of tropical cyclogenesis over the Earth's oceans. [...] Tropical cyclones can also cause a cool wake, due to turbulent mixing of the upper [...] of the ocean. [...] SST changes diurnally, like the air above it, but to a lesser degree. There is less SST variation on breezy days than on calm days. [...] In addition, ocean currents such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), can effect SST's on multi-decadal time scales, a major impact results from the global thermohaline circulation, which affects average SST significantly throughout most of the world's oceans.|$|E

2500|$|The study {{utilized}} a five-step {{approach to}} obtain the best fitting bra size for an individual. The study measured 45 women using the traditional selection method that adds 4 to the band size over-the-bust method. Women tried bras on until they obtained the best fit based on professional bra fitting criteria. The researchers found that 76% of women overestimated their band and 84% underestimated their cup size. When women wear bras with too big a band, breast support is reduced. Too small a cup size may cause skin irritation. They noted that [...] "ill-fitting bras and insufficient breast support {{can lead to the}} development of musculoskeletal pain and inhibit women participating in physical activity." [...] The study recommended that women should be educated about the criteria for finding a well-fitting bra. They recommended that women measure under their bust to determine their band size rather than the traditional over the bust <b>measurement</b> <b>method.</b>|$|E
