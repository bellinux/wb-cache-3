5|$|By August 1944, Turkey {{broke off}} {{relations}} with Germany, as defeat {{began to seem}} inevitable. In February 1945, it declared war on Germany and Japan, a symbolic <b>move</b> <b>that</b> allowed Turkey to join the emerging United Nations.|$|E
5|$|Between 1980 and 2000, Gulf {{moved from}} being a monolithic, {{vertically}} integrated multinational corporation to being more {{of a network of}} allied business interests. This has given the entire Gulf enterprise a high degree of strategic and operational flexibility. It is a <b>move</b> <b>that</b> reflects fundamental change in the economics of international business.|$|E
5|$|During matches, wrestlers have {{a health}} meter that drains as they perform special moves, and {{gradually}} refills {{when they are}} not attacking. Different moves use up different amounts of energy, and certain characters can win any match by repeatedly using a particularly damaging <b>move</b> <b>that</b> does not require much energy. Several different power-ups are also available in the game, including a donut that increases speed, bowling pins that can be used as clubs, and bubble gum that slows players down.|$|E
50|$|Black {{promotes}} a certain pawn, {{to either a}} knight, a bishop, a rook, or a queen - these are all <b>moves</b> <b>that</b> prevent checkmate on the next move, {{and they are the}} only <b>moves</b> <b>that</b> do so.|$|R
50|$|In some Pokémon video games, {{there is}} a Dark-type move called Taunt. Once it has been used, it only allows the other player to use <b>moves</b> <b>that</b> can inflict damage, instead of using <b>moves</b> <b>that</b> affect stats, status, weather, etc.|$|R

5|$|Entering the 2011–12 NCAA Division I men's {{basketball}} season head coach Mitch Henderson began his tenure at Princeton, taking over for Sydney Johnson. With the <b>move</b> <b>that</b> resulted from Johnson taking a new coaching job, Princeton has six alumni who are active Division I head coaches, a total {{second only to}} eight by the North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball program. The Ivy League media poll selected Princeton to be tied with Yale for second place behind Harvard. Princeton had been the preseason favorite the year before.|$|E
5|$|Having taken charge Huggins did not {{shy away}} from making {{personnel}} changes. Upon taking over the Yankees, he stressed fundamental baseball, drilling the Yankees {{in the art of}} the bunt. Huggins also made his first player transaction, acquiring Del Pratt and Eddie Plank from the St. Louis Browns trading Nick Cullop, Joe Gedeon, Fritz Maisel, Les Nunamaker, Urban Shocker and $15,000 ($ in current dollar terms), a <b>move</b> <b>that</b> led to criticism in the press.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, then-zoo {{director}} Jeff Williamson merged some {{departments of}} the zoo {{in a business}} <b>move</b> <b>that</b> was intended to provide a clearer direction for zoo operations. Many of the zoo's approximately 350 volunteers interpreted the merger as an elimination of volunteer training efforts. As a result, {{more than half of}} them left the zoo by 1999.|$|E

5|$|In February 1835, Ohio passed {{legislation}} {{that set up}} county governments in the Strip. The county in which Toledo sat would, later in 1835, be named after incumbent Governor Robert Lucas, a <b>move</b> <b>that</b> further exacerbated the growing tensions with Michigan. Also, during this period, Ohio attempted to use its power in Congress to revive a previously rejected boundary bill that would formally set the state border to be the Harris Line.|$|E
5|$|In January 1995, Georgia Frontiere, {{the owner}} of the National Football League team known as the Los Angeles Rams (now St. Louis Rams), {{announced}} she would <b>move</b> <b>that</b> team to St. Louis. The team replaced the St. Louis Cardinals (now Arizona Cardinals), an NFL franchise that had moved to St. Louis in 1960 but departed for Arizona in 1988. The Rams played their first game in their St. Louis stadium, the Edward Jones Dome, on October 22, 1996.|$|E
5|$|In September 1946, Broderick was {{assigned}} to the office of Mayor William O'Dwyer in an unannounced confidential capacity, a <b>move</b> <b>that</b> many in city government found surprising.

5|$|Ivan Sratsimir was proclaimed emperor in Vidin in 1356 {{and began}} to use the title Emperor of Bulgarians and Greeks, as his father. In order to secure the {{alliance}} of Wallachia, he married his first cousin Anna, {{the daughter of the}} Wallachian voivode Nicholas Alexander, in 1356 or 1357, a <b>move</b> <b>that</b> was probably arranged with the help of Ivan Sratsimir's mother Theodora as a reaction to the actions of Ivan Alexander.|$|E
5|$|On March 23, 2007, Maturi made a <b>move</b> <b>that</b> {{surprised}} many when {{he hired}} Tubby Smith after he {{resigned from the}} University of Kentucky {{to be the next}} head Gopher basketball coach. Smith's name recognition and winning reputation gave the program a new optimism, something it badly needed to counter its dwindling fan interest.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2016 season, Obafemi Martins {{abruptly}} {{left the}} club to sign with Shanghai Greenland Shenhua F.C. in the Chinese Super League, a <b>move</b> <b>that</b> would hamper the Sounders' offense during the season. The move was mitigated somewhat by the signing of homegrown product Jordan Morris. GM Lagerwey also traded Marco Pappa and Lamar Neagle to other clubs in the offseason.|$|E

5|$|Thatcher {{narrowly}} escaped {{injury in}} an IRA assassination {{attempt at a}} Brighton hotel {{early in the morning}} on 12 October 1984. Five people were killed, including the wife of minister John Wakeham. Thatcher was staying at the hotel to prepare for the Conservative Party conference, which she insisted should open as scheduled the following day. She delivered her speech as planned, though rewritten from her original draft, in a <b>move</b> <b>that</b> was widely supported across the political spectrum and enhanced her popularity with the public.|$|E
5|$|The bus tunnel was {{originally}} intended to be converted for use by light rail trains {{at some point in}} the future. Metro approved the addition of tracks to the bus tunnel in 1988, appropriating half of the $5 million used to install them during construction, the remainder coming from federal sources. To save $1.5 million in costs, Metro eliminated most of the rail's electrical insulation, a <b>move</b> <b>that</b> would later make them unusable for rail service.|$|E
5|$|The tournament was put {{in further}} {{jeopardy}} in January 1979 when General Motors withdrew as a major sponsor; Eagleson argued GM withdrew {{as a result of}} the dispute with the CAHA. The disputes put the two bodies on the verge of severing all ties, a <b>move</b> <b>that</b> would have led to Hockey Canada refusing to release any professional or university player to any of Canada's national teams. The tournament was ultimately postponed by a year until September 1980.|$|E

Nineteen officers and 34 civilians were accused of complicity in the coup and called before the Special Military Court.|$|E
5|$|When filming {{concluded}} in June 2001, the studio intended a United States release {{for the following}} Christmas. But by September 2001, Mendes requested more time.

5|$|Activision Publishing chief {{executive}} Mike Griffith, {{in response to}} questions about Activision's approach to the Guitar Hero market, noted that Guitar Hero continues to outsell the Rock Band series in both number of sales and revenue, with consumers continuing to buy the separate games on the market, and considered the market acceptance of the multiple games as validation for their model. Regardless, after releasing 25 different SKUs (between games and bundle packages) in 2009, Activision opted to reduce that number to 10 in 2010, recognizing the music game genre was not as profitable as it once was. Activision later opted to put future development of the series on hold in early 2011 citing weak sales in the rhythm game genre, a <b>move</b> <b>that</b> many journalists attributed to Activision's earlier oversaturation.|$|E
