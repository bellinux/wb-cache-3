When no <b>motor</b> <b>stall</b> is indicated {{and this is}} not derived from the pump logs, a roller study should be performed in case failure is suspected (Fig. 12). In this procedure, the pump is programmed in the continuous infusion mode, using a preset, without activation and with a priming bolus of 10  μl with a duration of 1  min. With fluoroscopy, the rotor is visualised, thereby reducing the aperture. A plain radiographic image is made and the preset bolus delivery is activated. After 2  min, a new plain radiographic image is made and the two images are compared. In a normal pump function, the rollers have moved approximately 60 ° from their original position. The extra radiopaque dot on one of the roller arms helps to visualise the roller movement (Fig. 12).|$|E

40|$|In recent years, the {{phenomenon}} of Fault-Induced Delayed Voltage Recovery (FIDVR) has increasingly been observed. Air conditioner (A/C) <b>motor</b> <b>stalling</b> is considered {{as one of the}} main reasons for the occurrence of delayed voltage recovery events [3]. This thesis studies the possibility that the stalling of a small percentage of induction motors could precipitate FIDVR events. A 12. 5 kV distribution network model with A/C motor load is used to construct certain bifurcation diagrams. Continuation methods based on the predictorcorrector technique are used to arrive at system steady-state solutions tracing the curves of motor behavior while the system bus voltage is varied. The stable and unstable operating points of induction machines are obtained and analyzed. Results show that a small percentage of induction <b>motors</b> <b>stalling</b> could exacerbate the <b>stalling</b> of additional <b>motors.</b> There could be either no stable solutions for the system with a partial number of A/C <b>motors</b> <b>stalled</b> or stable solutions with a certain number of A/C <b>motors</b> <b>stalled,</b> depending on the percentage of integrated motor loads. We conclude that a small percentage of <b>stalled</b> induction <b>motors</b> in practice could precipitate the <b>stalling</b> of additional <b>motors,</b> or even all motors in a distribution network. Thus, a mitigation strategy of replacing a number of ?prone to <b>stall?</b> <b>motors</b> to ?robust? ones may not effective.

40|$|Complex {{drilling}} operations, high {{production expenses}} {{and a low}} oil price influence the modern petroleum industry. Reducing the non-productive-time (NPT) during an operation can reduce the production expenses. Drilling, well control and mud equipment is responsible for 21 - 30 % of the NPT (Contractor, 2010). The industry needs solutions that reduces drilling related NPT. Our solution {{was to develop a}} program that predicts failures while drilling. The program reduces NPT by alerting the operator of failures that will occur in the future. Historical data on NPT during drilling is important when developing a failure-predicting program. Collected historical data was from 427 offshore wells in the Gulf of Mexico. The goal was to match program output with the historical data. The program was developed to calculate a probability distribution of future failures. The distribution is calculated based on symptoms detected in real-time-drilling-data (RTDD). As for medical diseases, the probability of a drilling related failure changes with the detected symptoms. A symptom can cause a positive or negative event. All symptoms were linked to their events through relationships. The relationships were collected in an ontology that serves as a database for the program. The program was developed by placing all relationships in a hierarchal structure. Symptoms were placed on the top and failures were placed {{on the bottom of the}} hierarchy. Detection of a symptom activates multiple paths leading to failures. The activated paths were added together and presented as a failure distribution. To match the historical failure distribution, the ontology and the complete program were adjusted. Data from three actual drilling operations were used to test the program. The failures were one case of lost circulation and two cases of motor stalls. Symptoms were detected and collected from End of Well (EoW) reports and RTDD. The program was capable of predicting the two cases of <b>motor</b> <b>stall</b> failures, but the lost circulation failure was only top three. Based on the successful prediction of motor stalls, the program was verified as logical. The most probable failure was <b>motor</b> <b>stall</b> with a probability of 18 %. The probabilities were not extreme enough, as the most probable failure should have a probability of at least 50 %. Future work includes adjusting the ontology to make the failure distribution extreme. To optimize the program further, a method that deactivates time and depth dependent symptoms must be developed. More EoW reports and RTDD are required to continue testing the program. By applying these changes, we believe that the program will be able to predict failures and hence reduce drilling related NPT...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The 14 - to 18 -amino acid kinesin neck linker domain {{links the}} core motor to the coiled-coil dimerization domain. One puzzle {{is that the}} neck linker appears too short for the 4 -nm {{distance}} each linker must stretch to enable an 8 -nm step—when modeled as an entropic spring, high inter-head forces are predicted when both heads are bound to the microtubule. We addressed this by analyzing {{the length of the}} neck linker across different kinesin families and using molecular dynamics simulations to model the extensibility of Kinesin- 1 and Kinesin- 2 neck linkers. The force–extension profile from molecular dynamics agrees with the worm-like chain (WLC) model for Kinesin- 1 and supports the puzzling prediction that extending the neck linker 4 nm requires forces multiple times the <b>motor</b> <b>stall</b> force. Despite being three amino acids longer, simulations suggest that extending the Kinesin- 2 neck linker by 4 nm requires similarly high forces. A possible resolution to this dilemma is that helix a- 6 may unwind to enable the two-head bound state. Finally, simu-lations suggest that cis/trans isomerization of a conserved proline residue in Kinesin- 2 accounts for the differing predictions of molecular dynamics and the WLC model, and may contribute to motor regulation in vivo...|$|E

40|$|In cells, organelles and vesicles {{are usually}} transported by {{cooperation}} of several motor proteins, including plus-end directed motor kinesin and minus-end directed motor dynein. Many biophysical {{models have been}} constructed to understand the mechanism of this motion. However, so far, the basic principle about it remains unclosed. In this paper, based on the recent experimental results and existing theoretical models, a spider-like model is provided. In this model, each motor {{is regarded as a}} bead-spring system. The bead can bind to or unbind from the track stochastically, and step forward or backward with fixed step size L and force dependent transition rates. The spring connects the bead to cargo tightly. At any time, the position of cargo is determined by force balance condition. The obvious characteristics of our model are that, the motors interact with each other and they do not share the external load equally. Our results indicate, the stall force of cargo, under which the mean velocity of cargo vanishes, usually decreases with the interactions between motors. If the cargo is pulled by several motors from same motor species, the stall force of cargo is bigger than that of the single motor, but usually smaller than their sum. However, if the cargo is pulled by two motors with different directionality, the stall force of cargo might bigger or smaller than the difference of the two single <b>motor</b> <b>stall</b> forces. The results imply, cooperation of several motors is helpful to pull big cargoes, though it is not so good as might be expected and no obvious help to improve the velocity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—After {{an initial}} fault lowers bus voltage, {{induction}} motors {{connected to the}} bus can successively stall in a cascading process {{that can lead to}} a voltage collapse or delayed voltage recovery. There are typically many induction motors connected to the bus, and models that aggregate the motors do not capture the cascading stall. We study the cascading stall in a simple power system with many induction motors using a quasistatic assumption and randomization of some motor parameters, and hence efficiently estimate the distribution of the number of motors stalled. This approach is also extended to a simple 4 -bus system and a simple motor dynamics and similar results are obtained. These distributions can often be fit with a high-level and generic probabilistic model of cascading failure, showing a commonality between cascading <b>motor</b> <b>stall</b> and other cascading processes.

40|$|Distribution {{systems are}} {{experiencing}} outages {{due to a}} phenomenon known as local voltage collapse. Local voltage collapse is occurring in part because modern air conditioner compressor motors are much more susceptible to stalling during a voltage dip than older motors. These motors can stall in less than 3 cycles (. 05 s) when a fault, such as on the sub-transmission system, causes voltage to sag to 70 to 60 %. The reasons for this susceptibility {{are discussed in the}} report. During the local voltage collapse, voltages are depressed for a period of perhaps one or two minutes. There is a concern that these local events are interacting together over larger areas and may present a challenge to system reliability. An effective method of preventing local voltage collapse is the use of voltage regulation from Distributed Energy Resources (DER) that can supply or absorb reactive power. DER, when properly controlled, can provide a rapid correction to voltage dips and prevent <b>motor</b> <b>stall.</b> This report discusses the phenomenon and causes of local voltage collapse as well as the control methodology we have developed to counter voltage sag. The problem is growing because of the use of low inertia, high efficiency air conditioner (A/C) compressor motors and because the use of electric A/C is growing in use and becoming a larger percentage of system load. A method for local dynamic voltage regulation is discussed which uses reactive power injection or absorption from local DER. This method is independent, rapid, and will not interfere with conventional utility system voltage control. The results of simulations of this method are provided. The method has also been tested at the ORNL s Distributed Energy Communications and Control (DECC) Laboratory using our research inverter and synchronous condenser. These systems at the DECC Lab are interconnected to an actual distribution system, the ORNL distribution system, which is fed from TVA s 161 kV sub-transmission backbone. The test results are also provided and discussed. The simulations and testing show that local voltage control from DER can prevent local voltage collapse.
