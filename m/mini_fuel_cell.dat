40|$|International audienceA {{prototype}} of a miniaturized fuel cell {{has been studied}} in order to detect carbon monoxide in hydrogen-rich atmosphere for PEMFC (proton exchange membrane fuel cell) applications. It consists on a single PEMFC (membrane-electrode-assembly supplied by CEA/LITEN) directly fed by the hydrogen-carbon monoxide mixture while the cathode is exposed to ambient air. Experiments {{have been carried out}} on a laboratory testing bench with simulated reforming gas. Two working modes have been studied. For low CO concentrations (≤ 20 ppm), the amperometric mode is suitable but a regeneration in air is necessary to obtain a good reversibility of the sensor response. On the contrary, for higher CO concentrations (250 - 4000 ppm), a good reversible response is observed without air regenerating by using a potentiometric or quasi-potentiometric mode. Therefore, this {{prototype of}} <b>mini</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> sensor seems to be convenient for monitoring reformed gases either for low temperature PEMFC which are poisoned by very low traces of CO or for high temperature PEMFC which can operate at higher CO concentrations...|$|E

30|$|Based on {{operating}} temperatures, PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> may {{be divided}} into two categories: low-temperature PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> and high-temperature PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells.</b> Low-temperature PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> have a low operating temperature below 100  °C, whereas high-temperature PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> work at temperatures above 100  °C, typically in the range from 120 to 180  °C [2]. The heat and mass transport phenomena and material properties of low-temperature and high-temperature PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> have some significant differences. A low-temperature PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> typically needs and produces liquid water to keep the membrane hydrated, which incurs complicated heat and mass transport processes [3].
