5|$|In 1987, {{the media}} speculated that Clinton {{would enter the}} Presidential race after {{incumbent}} New York Governor <b>Mario</b> <b>Cuomo</b> declined to run and Democratic front-runner Gary Hart withdrew owing to revelations of marital infidelity. Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton for governor, initially favored—but ultimately vetoed—by the First Lady). For the nomination, Clinton endorsed Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and {{twice as long as}} it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long and poorly delivered. Clinton presented himself as both a moderate and a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, and he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, then-New York Governor <b>Mario</b> <b>Cuomo</b> {{allocated}} $22 million to renew {{planning and design}} efforts for the Second Avenue line, but in 1993 the MTA, facing budget cuts, removed these funds from its capital budget. In 1995, the MTA began its Manhattan East Side Alternatives (MESA) study, both a MIS and a DEIS, seeking ways to alleviate overcrowding on the Lexington Avenue Line and improve mobility on Manhattan's East Side. The study analyzed several alternatives, such as improvements to the Lexington Avenue Line to increase capacity, enhanced bus service with dedicated lanes, and light rail or ferry service on the East Side. Second Avenue was chosen over First Avenue for logistical reasons. In November 1997, the MTA initiated the Lower Manhattan Access Study (LMA) to improve access to Lower Manhattan from the New York City suburbs. The construction of the Second Avenue Subway from 63rd Street to Lower Manhattan {{was one of the}} five build alternatives developed by the study.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, he {{was picked}} by New York Governor <b>Mario</b> <b>Cuomo</b> to chair a {{scientific}} fact-finding commission on the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, a job that required him {{to find common ground}} between the many viewpoints represented on the commission. The commission eventually recommended the closure of the plant, a course he personally disagreed with. Cuomo had formed the commission in mid-May 1983 to provide him with recommendations regarding the plant's safety, the adequacy of emergency plans, and the economics of operating the plant. The commission's consensus recommendations included unanimous findings that no emergency evacuation of the plant could be conducted without the cooperation of Suffolk County, which was refusing to approve an evacuation plan; that the construction of the plant would have been prevented if it had been started after new Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations were put into effect after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979; and that operating the plant would not reduce utility costs. Marburger himself at the time emphasized that the governor had not been seeking a consensus but rather encouraged multiple viewpoints to be reflected, and characterized the consensus conclusions as not the only important section of the report.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her law firm work, Sotomayor found visible public service roles.

In 1987, Governor of New York <b>Mario</b> <b>Cuomo</b> appointed Sotomayor {{to the board of}} the State of New York Mortgage Agency, which she served on until 1992. As part of one of the largest urban rebuilding efforts in American history, the agency helped low-income people get home mortgages and to provide insurance coverage for housing and AIDS hospices. Despite being the youngest member of a board composed of strong personalities, she involved herself in the details of the operation and was effective. She was vocal in supporting the right to affordable housing, directing more funds to lower-income home owners, and in her skepticism about the effects of gentrification, although in the end she voted in favor of most of the projects.|$|E
