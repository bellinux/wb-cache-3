25|$|Of this {{head and}} two other pieces of {{sculpture}} exhibited by Brâncuși in July, 1913, at the Allied Artists' Exhibition in London, Roger Fry said in The Nation, August 2: Constantin Brâncuși's sculptures have not, I think, been seen before in England. His three heads are the most remarkable works of sculpture at the Albert Hall. Two are in brass and one in stone. They show a technical skill which is almost disquieting, a skill which might lead him, in default of any overpowering imaginative purpose, to become a brilliant pasticheur. But it seemed to <b>me</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> evidence of passionate conviction; that the simplification of forms was no mere exercise in plastic design, but a real interpretation of the rhythm of life. These abstract vivid forms into which he compresses his heads give a vivid presentment of character; they are not empty abstractions, but filled with a content which has been clearly, and passionately apprehended.|$|E

[...] The dead were left on the field or buried in shallow graves, where they were later found by the French.|$|E

500|$|Despite Coveleski's {{success in}} Cleveland, {{he was not}} a fan of playing there; he stated that he [...] "didn't like the town. Now the people are all right, but I just didn't like the town." [...] He also stated that it began to affect his {{performance}} on the mound, and that he began to get [...] "lazy" [...] from being with the club so long. He did, however, have praise for his catcher: [...] "The best thing that happened to <b>me</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> pitching to Steve O'Neill. He caught me for nine years in Cleveland and knew me so well he didn't even need to give me a sign".|$|E
500|$|In a 2013 interview, {{the band}} {{revealed}} that they partied heavily during {{the production of}} Follow the Leader, with massive amounts of alcohol, drugs, {{and women in the}} studio. Davis explained further, saying that while recording the vocals for [...] "It's On", there were [...] "people getting blowjobs right behind <b>me,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> girls banging each other in front of me, people getting boned in the closet right behind me, it was the craziest shit I've {{ever seen in my life}} and I sang that song." [...] According to Davis, he only agreed to begin tracking vocals when producer Toby Wright met his demands for an eight-ball (a one-eighth ounce of cocaine).|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} the subplot of Homer's {{parenting}} originated from a real fatherhood test executive producer Sam Simon found and brought to the Simpsons studio. Levine later commented on writing the episode, [...] "At the time David and I were writing this, my son, Matt, was about Bart's age. [...] So for <b>me</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{a certain amount of}} guilt associated, like 'Do I know my son's hobby? Do I know my son's best friend?' etc." [...] The scene in which Bart welds on his racer resulted in an argument between the staff of the show and the Fox network's censors. The censors were concerned that children would imitate Bart by misusing welding tools; however, the staff was able to convince them that very few children have access to welding tools.|$|E

500|$|Armstrong {{prepared}} {{his famous}} epigram on his own. In a post-flight press conference, {{he said that}} he decided on the words [...] "just prior to leaving the LM [...]" [...] In a 1983 interview in Esquire Magazine, Armstrong explained to George Plimpton: [...] "I always knew there was a good chance of being able to return to Earth, but I thought the chances of a successful touchdown on the moon surface were about even money—fifty–fifty... Most people don't realize how difficult the mission was. So it didn't seem to <b>me</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> much point in thinking of something to say if we'd have to abort landing." [...] In 2012, brother Dean Armstrong claimed that Neil had shown him a note with a draft of the line months before the launch, although historian Andrew Chaikin, who had interviewed the astronaut in 1988 for his book A Man on the Moon, disputed that he had ever claimed coming up with the line spontaneously during the mission.|$|E
500|$|Neither Carter nor Duchovny were {{contracted}} {{to work on}} the series beyond the seventh season; however, Fox entered into negotiations near the end of season in order to bring the two on board for an eighth season. After the airing of [...] "Requiem", Duchovny expressed his intentions to leave the series. He explained, [...] "I was kind of a free agent after season seven, and to <b>me,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> not much else to do in terms of the character. So it was really about me wanting to pursue other parts of my career as a writer, director, and actor." [...] Rumors began spreading—and were eventually confirmed—that, since Duchovny had not expressed an interest to appear as a main character in the eighth season, that another character would take Mulder's place. Many fans on the internet believed that Mitch Pileggi, who portrayed Walter Skinner, would take the role; Pileggi later called this guess [...] "ridiculous." ...|$|E
500|$|Because {{there was}} still a chance that the seventh season may have been the show's last, the {{character}} of Billy Miles, played by Zachary Ansley and who originally appeared in the pilot episode, was brought back in and featured in [...] "Requiem" [...] to bring the series full-circle. Ansley would also appear in several eighth season episodes as well. After the conclusion of the episode, David Duchovny expressed his desire to leave the series. He explained, [...] "I was kind of a free agent after season seven, and to <b>me,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> not much else to do in terms of the character.

According to People, [...] "Call it a finger malfunction? Madonna {{was supposed to be the}} center of attention during the Super Bowl halftime show Sunday, but the Queen of Pop was upstaged by her collaborator M.I.A., who flipped off the camera at one point during the performance, prompting swift apologies from the NFL and NBC." [...] Madonna expressed her disappointment in an interview with host Ryan Seacrest on his talk show, On Air with Ryan Seacrest. She said that it was a [...] "teenager ... irrelevant thing" [...] for M.I.A. to do, and was [...] "out of place" [...] in the show: [...] "I was really surprised. I didn't know anything about it. I wasn't happy about it. I understand it's punk rock and everything, but to <b>me</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> such a feeling of love and good energy and positivity; it seemed negative." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{a letter}} filed with the UK Registrar of Companies, the {{auditors}} to Gyrus resigned [...] "partly because of its client's accounting for the securities". KPMG qualified Gyrus' accounts {{because they could not}} ascertain that Axam was not a related party. The auditors also took issue with the accounting treatment of the preference shares. In its audit letter to Gyrus Group dated 26 April 2010, KPMG considered that there were [...] "circumstances connected with our ceasing to hold office that should be {{brought to the attention of}} the company's members or creditors." [...] Ernst & Young, the firm that succeeded KPMG, also expressed reservations about the 2010 Gyrus accounts for uncertainty, due to the lack of information about Axam. Bloomberg noted that both Gyrus annual reports were filed late: instead of filing within the nine-month statutory limit, the accounts were filed more than a year from the company's year end. In late November 2011 Michael Andrew, KPMG International global chairman, said his firm had complied with its legal obligations to pass on information related to Olympus's 2008 acquisition of Gyrus, and were removed as auditors for so doing. Andrew said: [...] "It's pretty evident to <b>me</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> very, very significant fraud and that a number of parties had been complicit." [...] However, the while the Japanese firm forced a ¥71 billion restatement of dubious valuation of certain acquired assets, the firm signed off on the financial statements in the same year that contained questionable figures other members of its global network in UK and elsewhere had apparently expressed grave reservations over.|$|E
500|$|Although it {{had been}} {{reported}} for several years that Jackson had an abusive childhood, he first spoke openly {{about it in a}} 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey. He grimaced when speaking of the childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he stated he had missed out on much of his childhood, admitting that he often cried from loneliness. In the same interview, speaking of his father, Jackson said, [...] "There were times when he'd come to see me, I'd get sick...I'd start to regurgitate. I'm sorry...Please don't be mad at me...But I do love him". In Jackson's other high-profile interview Living with Michael Jackson (2003), he covered his face with his hand and began crying when talking about his childhood abuse. Jackson recalled that Joseph sat in a chair as the group rehearsed, saying, [...] "He had this belt in his hand. If you didn't do it the right way, he would tear you up, really get you. It was bad. Real bad". When Jackson received his Living Legend award—presented to him by Janet Jackson—at the 1993 Grammys, he said, [...] "I don't read all the things written about me, I wasn't aware the world thought I was so weird and bizarre. But when you grow up like I did in front of 100million people since the age of five, you're automatically different...My childhood was completely taken away from <b>me.</b> <b>There</b> <b>was</b> no Christmas, no birthdays. It was not a normal childhood, no normal pleasures of childhood. Those were exchanged for hard work, struggle and pain, and eventual material and professional success".|$|E

Speaking in 2003 of her experiences as a teenage mother, Rivera explained, [...] "Usually, when a young girl is pregnant, she drops out of school and concentrates on being a mother. I thought that's what I had to do, but my counselors told <b>me</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no way they would let me drop out. I had too much promise."

2500|$|Hopper had a {{supporting}} role as the bet-taker, [...] "Babalugats", in Cool Hand Luke (1967). In 1968, Hopper teamed with Peter Fonda, Terry Southern and Jack Nicholson to make Easy Rider, which premiered in July 1969. With the release of True Grit a month earlier, Hopper had starring roles in two major box office films that summer. Hopper won wide acclaim as the director for his improvisational methods and innovative editing for Easy Rider. The production was plagued by creative differences and personal acrimony between Fonda and Hopper, the dissolution of Hopper's marriage to Hayward, his unwillingness to leave the editor's desk and his accelerating abuse of drugs and alcohol. Hopper said of Easy Rider: [...] "The cocaine problem in the United States is really because of <b>me.</b> <b>There</b> <b>was</b> no cocaine before Easy Rider on the street. After Easy Rider, it was everywhere".|$|E
