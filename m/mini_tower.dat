Reed had great {{things to say about}} the computer, including [...] "I highly suggest that if you’re looking or are {{in the market for a}} new gaming PC that you check out AVADirect, they make a great computer that hit everything on my pro list and nothing on my con. Even the price point is excellent". Reed also mentioned [...] "I’m going to be looking at one really hard when I need to replace my old Gateway in the office".Digital Trends reviewed the AVADirect Avant Tower in May 2016. Reviewer Brad Bourque was sent the system with a Nvidia GeForce GTX 980 Ti, 16GB of RAM, and an Intel Core i7-6700K. Bourque said, [...] "the Avant is built for users who might want to add on later... The result is minimal clutter in the visible area of the case, with power and data mostly running behind the motherboard. Should you need to access the internals, it’s simple enough thanks to a hinged side panel with a quick release handle... If it’s value you’re hunting, it’s hard to beat the AVADirect Avant".|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{urbanization}} facing {{developing countries}} is increasing pressure on public institutions {{to provide adequate}} supplies of clean water to populations. In most developing countries, the general public {{is not involved in}} strategies and policies regarding enhancement, conservation, and management of water supply systems. To assist governments and decision makers in providing potable water to meet the increasing demand due to the rapid urbanization, this study sought to characterize existing water supply systems and obtain public opinion for identifying a community water supply system model for households in a residential neighborhood in Lomé, Togo. Existing water supply systems in the study area consist of bucket-drawn water wells, <b>mini</b> water <b>tower</b> systems, rainwater harvesting, and public piped water. Daily domestic water consumption in the study area compared well with findings on water uses per capita from Sub-Saharan Africa, but was well below daily water usage in developed nations. Based on the surveys, participants thought highly of a large scale community water tower and expressed interest in maintaining it. Even though people rely on water sources deemed convenient for drinking, they also reported limited confidence in the quality of these sources...|$|R
5000|$|A {{new church}} {{building}} {{was completed in}} 1865. It contained an altar built of native walnut {{that has been used}} ever since. [...] Grace Church was named the diocesan cathedral by the Convention of the Diocese of Kansas in June 1879. Part of the Bethany Place property was set aside {{for the construction of a}} new cathedral in 1886. Financial difficulties, however, delayed its construction. The foundation for the present cathedral was laid in 1910 and the walls were completed in 1912. The final fundraising push was initiated by Bishop Frank Rosebrook Millspaugh and Dean J. P. DeBevers Kaye. The structure was completed, <b>minus</b> the <b>towers,</b> in 1917. They were completed along with the rest of the cathedral complex under the leadership of Dean John Warren Day (1927-1957) and Dean Leslie Skerry Olsen (1957-1984). On November 26, 1975 the cathedral was extensively damaged in a fire set by an arsonist. Services were held in the Great Hall utilizing the old walnut altar, which had been saved, until the cathedral was reopened on October 1, 1978. The current building has had much work done in recent years to update and keep the maintenance up. A renovation of the 1951 Cloister building was completed in late 2014, featuring a two story tall main entrance Common Room. A capital campaign is currently underway to build a new main floor parish hall to the south onto the Bethany Place grounds of the Diocese of Kansas.|$|R
5000|$|Yakima, Washington, c. 1912: The Northern Pacific {{built at}} least three depots in Yakima. The first when they began {{construction}} across Stampede Pass c. 1884, the second, larger wood structure in 1901 was alleged to have a clock tower, and the final depot in a style {{similar to that in}} nearby Ellensburg, Washington, c. 1912. The last was likely the Reed and Stem design. Another noted architect -- Cass Gilbert, designed the 1901 depot. This structure was later relocated to another part of town, and converted into an apartment building. As of 2010, it was still standing in Yakima, <b>minus</b> the clock <b>tower.</b> Because the Northern Pacific never installed clocks in a tower, instead they used their large Monad trademark (the ying-yang), adopted by the road in 1896. In addition to the 1901 depot at Yakima, Gilbert also designed the Northern Pacific's depots at Little Falls, Minnesota, Bismarck, North Dakota, and Fargo, North Dakota.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Despite {{emerging}} water shortages, most {{water is}} only used once, and often with low efficiency. However, with appropriate treatment, {{water can be}} re–used to reduce the demand on freshwater sources. The Department of Water Affairs, South Africa, promotes industries to reduce discharges into water resources in order to sustain an overall good water quality of all water systems. All of this ultimately leads to industries striving towards zero effluent discharge. Primary Column Bottoms (PCBs) is a wastewater stream derived from the Fischer–Tropsch Gas to Liquid process and consists mainly of organic acids, but no nitrogen or phosphorous, which by implication excludes possible biodegradation. In the operation of cooling towers in industrial processes, cooling water quality has {{a direct impact on}} the cooling performance of the system, where nutrient levels may affect fouling, scaling and corrosion observed in the cooling towers. Fouling, scaling and corrosion affect the operating efficiency of cooling water systems and may necessitate the addition of chemical agents to control these phenomena. This has a financial and labour time impact on the operation of these systems. In this study a <b>mini</b> cooling <b>tower</b> test rig was operated with a synthetic PCB effluent as cooling water and various cycles of concentration, pH and linear flow velocities (LFVs). A constant delta temperature of 10 °C was maintained. Cycles of concentration (COC) evaluated included 2, 4 and 6 cycles of concentration and linear flow velocities evaluated was 0. 6 m/s, 0. 9 m/s and 1. 2 m/s. Fouling, scaling and corrosion rates were determined using corrosion coupons and heat exchanger tubes for mild steel and stainless steel. Besides the evaluation of the various operational parameters for fouling, scaling and corrosion, the possibility for chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal by operating the cooling tower as a bioreactor was also evaluated. To this end nutrient correction was applied to the reactor to allow for a CNP ratio of 100 : 10 : 1. With regard to fouling, scaling and corrosion, mild steel was more affected by fouling, scaling and corrosion compared to stainless steel where almost no fouling, scaling and corrosion was observed. Overall increased linear flow velocities resulted in higher fouling and scaling rates, whereas lower linear flow velocities resulted in decreased corrosion rates. In terms of cycles of concentration, increased COC resulted in higher fouling, scaling and corrosion rates. Despite the high nutrient removal levels, the accompanying fouling, scaling and corrosion was still below the particular industry’s guidelines. Besides physical–chemical evaluation of the towers under the various operational conditions, culture–dependent and culture–independent methods were also employed. Concerning culture–dependent approaches the study demonstrated that aerobic and anaerobic organisms are present in both the planktonic and sessile phase of the cooling tower reactors. Heterotrophic aerobes were found to be the most abundant under all the operating conditions. Sulphate reducing bacteria were more abundant in the sessile phase of the cooling towers, and the presence of high sulphate levels in the experiments could be indicative of the sulphate reducing bacteria actively participating in the microbial community. Lower than expected corrosion levels, however, suggest that a combination of the organisms in the biofilm rather than sulphate reducing bacteria alone, contributed to the corrosion rates observed. Culture–independent methods, specifically phospholipid fatty acid analysis supported the results from the culture–dependent methods. Furthermore results demonstrated that linear flow velocity had a greater effect on the community structure than cycles of concentration. Finally molecular methods, specifically denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, found that increasing cycles of concentration resulted in increased microbial community diversity, while increasing linear flow velocity resulted in decreased microbial community diversity. Regarding COD removal, nutrient correction of the synthetic PCB effluent achieved 89. 35 % COD removal at 2 COC and 1. 2 m/s LFV, while 80. 85 % COD removal was achieved at 4 COC at 1. 2 m/s LFV. From these results it was recommended that the operation of the cooling tower should be at 4 COC and 1. 2 m/s, which despite slightly lower % COD removal, were characterised by fouling, scaling and corrosion rates well within guidelines.
