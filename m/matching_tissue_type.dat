Biliary atresia in children and nonalcoholic cirrhosis in adults are the most common indications for the procedure. Transplantation currently plays only a minor role in the treatment of hepatic malignant disease.

Approximately 70 % of recipients survive for 1 year, and these patients have an excellent prospect of long-term survival.

40|$|AbstractSAGE (serial {{analysis}} of gene expression) detects transcripts by extracting short tags from the transcripts. Because {{of the limited}} length, many SAGE tags are shared by transcripts from different genes. Relying on sequence information in the general gene expression database has limited power {{to solve this problem}} due to the highly heterogeneous nature of the deposited sequences. Considering that the complexity of gene expression at a single tissue level should be much simpler than that in the general expression database, we reasoned that by restricting gene expression to tissue level, the accuracy of gene annotation for the nonspecific SAGE tags should be significantly improved. To test the idea, we developed a tissue-specific SAGE annotation database based on microarray data (www. basic. northwerstern. edu/SAGE). This database contains microarray expression information represented as UniGene clusters for 73 normal human tissues and 18 cancer tissues and cell lines. The nonspecific SAGE tag is first matched to the database by the same <b>tissue</b> <b>type</b> used by both SAGE and microarray analysis; then the multiple UniGene clusters assigned to the nonspecific SAGE tag are searched in the database under the <b>matched</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>type.</b> The UniGene cluster presented solely or at higher expression levels in the database is annotated to represent the specific gene for the nonspecific SAGE tags. The accuracy of gene annotation by this database was largely confirmed by experimental data. Our study shows that microarray data provide a useful source for annotating the nonspecific SAGE tags...|$|R

50|$|Cord blood {{stem cells}} (though usually from donors) are {{currently}} used {{in the treatment of}} several life-threatening conditions, mainly blood and immune system related genetic diseases, cancers, and blood disorders.

Since then, cord blood has become increasingly recognized as a source of stem cells {{that can be used in}} stem cell therapy. Recent studies have shown that cord blood has unique advantages over traditional bone marrow transplantation, particularly in children, and can be life-saving in rare cases where a suitable bone-marrow donor cannot be found. Cord blood stem cells can also be used for siblings and other members of your family who have a <b>matching</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>type.</b> Siblings have a 25% chance of compatibility, and the cord blood may even be a match for parents (50%) and grandparents.|$|E

HLA type is inherited from both parents, so siblings are particularly {{likely to be a}} match, and people from the same ethnic heritage are more likely to match. Minority ethnic groups have difficulty finding a perfectly matched transplant donor. Studies have found that allogeneic transplants have a better outcome when the donor and patient are related. The odds that two siblings will have the 6/6 match required for a bone marrow transplant are 25%. The odds that two siblings will have the 4/6 match required for a cord blood transplant are 39%.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: In thyroid and {{parathyroid}} surgery iatrogenic injury of the parathyroid glands or the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) is {{a possible}} complication {{that needs to be}} prevented. The visible contrast between thyroid and parathyroid tissue is delicate to observe. The aim of this pilot study was to collect in vivo spectral reflectance-signatures of critical <b>tissue</b> <b>types</b> encountered during thyroid and parathyroid surgery, and to assess the presence of useful spectral distinctive features that might be applied for future devices enabling intraoperative tissue-specific image contrast enhancement. METHODS: Wide-band spectra (350 - 1830 nm, 1 nm resolution) were collected in vivo during thyroid and parathyroid surgery. Subjected to <b>tissue</b> <b>type</b> accessibility, on average 2 <b>tissue</b> <b>types</b> per patient were measured. For each <b>tissue</b> <b>type,</b> 5 spectra were recorded per site, covering 1 - 2 sites per <b>tissue</b> <b>type.</b> Mean <b>tissue</b> spectra were calculated for all measured <b>tissue</b> <b>types.</b> After visually comparing these mean spectra, two spectral signature features for all individual measured sites were extracted: 1. Slope within the 650 - 700 nm range; 2. Amplitude gradient between dominant local reflectance minimum and maximum within 1350 - 1830 nm. RESULTS: In 10 consecutive patients 158 in vivo spectra were recorded on 32 tissue sites. Based on the mean diffuse reflectance spectra for thyroid, parathyroid and RLN, the estimated features for the three <b>tissue</b> <b>types</b> were plotted. Significance was tested using a paired Student's t-test and by applying a Holm-Bonferoni correction (criterion set to p< 0. 025). Regarding feature 1 significance was found for parathyroid (p= 0. 003) and RLN (p= 0. 006). With respect to feature 2 RLN was significant (p= 0. 001). Both investigated spectral features seem to offer added value to distinguish between the studied <b>tissue</b> <b>types.</b> CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this study is the first to date to investigate in vivo spectral reflectance-signatures of critical tissues encountered during parathyroid and thyroid surgery, far beyond the spectral detection boundary of the human eye (i. e. the infrared light spectrum). Within the recorded spectral reflectance-signatures we identified two spectral features which may be used for further developments towards intraoperative image contrast enhancement and thereby facilitate differentiation of tissue structures, either during open or endoscopic surgery...|$|R
