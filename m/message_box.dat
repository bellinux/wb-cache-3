25|$|The chat system enables {{players to}} {{communicate}} with each other. Public Chat broadcasts text to players in the local area on one server, both by text appearing above the speaker's head and in the <b>message</b> <b>box.</b> Friends Chat broadcasts text in the <b>message</b> <b>box</b> only to certain players tuned into a specific channel, who can be available on any RuneScape world. Each Friends Chat channel has an owner, who can assign different ranks to individual players; players' ranks dictate their ability to perform administrative tasks within the channel. Clan Chat allows members of a clan {{to communicate with}} each other through a separate channel. Quick Chat allows players to choose from a list of predetermined messages to send as Public Chat, Clan Chat, or Friends Chat.|$|E
25|$|Then, Apple {{decided that}} most of its {{application}} software packages, including HyperCard, would be the property of a wholly owned subsidiary called Claris. Many of the HyperCard developers chose to stay at Apple rather than move to Claris, causing the development team to be split. Claris, {{in the business of}} selling software for a profit, attempted to create a business model where HyperCard could also generate revenues. At first the freely-distributed versions of HyperCard shipped with authoring disabled. Early versions of Claris HyperCard contained an Easter Egg: typing 'magic' into the <b>message</b> <b>box</b> would convert the player into a full HyperCard authoring environment. When this trick became nearly-universal they wrote a new viewer only version, the HyperCard Player which Apple distributed with the Macintosh operating system, while Claris sold the full version commercially. Many users were upset that they had to pay to use software that had traditionally been supplied free and which many considered a basic part of the Mac.|$|E

50|$|Message passing {{processing}} uses {{channels and}} <b>message</b> <b>boxes</b> but this communication adds transfer overhead on the bus, additional memory need for queues and <b>message</b> <b>boxes</b> and latency in the messages. Designs of parallel processors use special buses like crossbar {{so that the}} communication overhead will be small {{but it is the}} parallel algorithm that decides the volume of the traffic.|$|R

The in-game text displays lesser-known forms of words, for example Gwenhyver, Excaliber, Gawaine, Launcelot, and magick {{instead of the}} better-known Guinevere, Excalibur, Gawain, Lancelot, and magic. The parser, however, understood all spellings.|$|R
2500|$|Adding scripts is also easy. [...] The user simply command-option-clicked (or could {{click the}} Script button in the item's {{property}} dialog) on any {{element in the}} stack, and an editor would pop up. The script may then be edited, saved, and used immediately. Also, HyperCard contains a <b>Message</b> <b>Box,</b> an interactive command-line in a floating window that can execute single lines of script. This also includes the find command, so it doubles as a search dialog. HyperCard 2.0 added a debugger, also.|$|E

50|$|Starting {{with the}} {{integration}} of faxing devices into computers via Fax modems the automated answering of voice calls by a computer went live via specific software, like e.g. TalkWorks. These systems allowed for quite elaborate voice box systems, navigated via dual-tone multi-frequency signaling, allowing a computer on a (single) telephony line {{to sound like a}} professional telephony system with hierarchical fax and <b>message</b> <b>boxes</b> with an automatic call distributor, where a caller might deposit his messages, leave his faxes behind, might listen to specific messages, or start a fax-back service.|$|R
5000|$|There is a {{function}} called [...] in the [...] namespace {{which can be used}} (instead of [...] ) similarly to the corresponding function in Visual Basic 6.

Some programmers prefer to do things [...] "the [...]NET way", since the Framework classes have more features and are less language-specific. Others argue that using language-specific features makes code more readable (for example, using [...] (C#) or [...] (VB.NET) instead of [...] ).|$|R

50|$|Nagware (also {{known as}} begware, annoyware or a nagscreen) is a pejorative term for {{shareware}} that persistently reminds {{the user to}} purchase a license.
