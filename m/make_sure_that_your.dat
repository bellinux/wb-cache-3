40|$|God {{has given}} us rain / water as a mercy gift. Why, we are human being make it become a disaster? Why our efforts to {{overcome}} floods, pollutions until now, did not give good results yet? Because, the most precious gift has been given by God, free! And often, we can not appreciate something got free. That 2 ̆ 7 s why, we are used, on purpose, to flow the rain water to drainage, small / big river and last, to the sea/ ocean. Natural Zeolites, which are treated physically & chemically (TNZ) can be used succesfully, as media water filter and gas / air (adsorbent) purifier. A certain type of TNZ can neutralize the acid rain and make its void (channel) pores as prisoner for the heavy dangerous metals. If we install the pipe of factory ehimney horizontally (not vertically) and insert the ZA granules in the muffler that way, then we will make our air, fresh and clean. Grey Water which come out from the domestic waste water, will be changed into clear (transparant) clean water, if filtered through TNZ filter bed, while Biolite will change the black water into excellent organic Fertilizer. Biolite is a liquid product, produced from Zeolite powder and probiotic bacterie & additives. The Zeolite powder will adsorb the colour & bad smells and the bacterie will reduce the faeces volume of the Black Water. By using a new (innovative) Domestic Waste Water Treatment Plant (DWWTP) you can easily recycle and reuse the final effluent. Beside this DWWTP will give you excellent organic fertilizer as added value, the investment & operational costs are much reduced & efficient compare to the old (conventional) one. So, you can rely on Zeolite minerals (TNZ, ZA) & its derivat Biolite, not only as soil conditioner, but also to <b>make</b> you <b>sure,</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> plants will grow fertile.

50|$|ELIGIBILTY TO ADOPT Before you {{can bring}} a child home from another country, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) must {{determine}} that {{you are able to}} provide a loving, stable home for that child. The most important requirement for USCIS approval is a home study that establishes your ability to care for a child. Every state has different requirements for this home study, but in general all home studies detail personal, financial, and medical information. They include items such as personal references, fingerprint clearances, verification of employment, proof of health and life insurance, and sometimes photos of your home and family. Home studies are typically prepared by a social work professional or organization, though state laws vary. Your adoption service provider should know the requirements of your state, and <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> home study satisfies all laws and regulations (including those of the Hague Adoption Convention). If adopting from a Hague Convention country, your home study must be completed by an accredited adoption service provider unless the home study preparer qualifies as an exempted provider.

50|$|The Evolutionary Theory of Morality {{tries to}} explain {{morality}} and its development in terms of evolution and how it may at first seem contradictory for humans to have morals and morality in the evolutionary opinion. Evolution has many beliefs and parts to it but as most commonly seen, it is {{the survival of the}} fittest. This behavior is driven from the desire to pass on your genes. Whether that means being selfish or caring for your young just to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> genes survive. That may seem to conflict with morality and having morals, however some argue that that may be related and having morality and morals might actually be a factor that contributes to the theory of evolution. Additionally, humans have developed communities and a social lifestyle which makes it necessary to develop morals. In an evolutionary view, a human being that acts immorally will suffer consequences, such as paying a fine, going to prison, or being an outcast. Whatever it is, there is a loss to that human. Therefore, that individual eventually learns that to be accepted in society, it is necessary to develop morals and act on them.|$|E
