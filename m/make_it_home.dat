5|$|The Philippines' rainforests and its {{extensive}} coastlines <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>home</b> to {{a diverse}} range of birds, plants, animals, and sea creatures. It {{is one of the}} ten most biologically megadiverse countries. Around 1,100 land vertebrate species {{can be found in the}} Philippines including over 100 mammal species and 170 bird species not thought to exist elsewhere. The Philippines has among the highest rates of discovery in the world with sixteen new species of mammals discovered in the last ten years. Because of this, the rate of endemism for the Philippines has risen and likely will continue to rise. Native mammals include the palm civet cat, the dugong, the cloud rat and the Philippine tarsier associated with Bohol.|$|E

2500|$|Yocum began a 16-month journey, dubbed [...] "The Drum Hike" [...] on April 17, 2010 at the Kentucky Derby Festival's Thunder Over Louisville celebration. Yocum bangs his drum when {{entering}} {{towns and}} cities to bring attention to his cause and carries a bat for mayors and governors to sign.

2500|$|By season 3 (1974–1975), McLean Stevenson {{had begun}} chafing {{at what he}} {{considered}} to be a supporting role to Alan Alda and Wayne Rogers. Midway through the season, he informed the producers that he wanted to leave M*A*S*H. With ample time to prepare a [...] "Goodbye, Henry" [...] show, it was decided that Henry Blake would be discharged and sent home for the season-3 finale, which aired on Tuesday, March 18, 1975. In the final scene of his last episode ("Abyssinia, Henry"), Radar tearfully reports that Henry's plane has been shot down over the Sea of Japan, and there were no survivors. This part of the script was kept secret from the cast. The producers wanted the reaction to be as much of a surprise as possible. Originally, the episode was written with Henry making it home, but the writers wanted to show that it was war and people may not <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Another {{difference}} between baseball and cricket strategy {{is the importance}} of sacrifice plays in baseball. These are plays in which a batter deliberately hits in a particular way or in a particular direction to advance runner at the expense of himself getting out. For example, a poor batter may deliberately bunt (hit a low slow ball) a ball towards first base so that he will be easily put out, to ensure that a runner on second base will end up safe on third. A stronger batter may deliberately hit a long [...] "sacrifice fly" [...] that he knows will be caught (resulting in an out) so that a runner can <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>home</b> to score a run. This strategy results from the relative cheapness of individual outs in baseball and the relative importance of individual runs in baseball compared to cricket, where such a strategy would be foolish as runs cannot be scored when a wicket has fallen except {{in the case of a}} run-out (although if a batsman is caught and if he and the non-striker attempt a run and cross each other the new batsman must assume the non-striker's position).|$|E
2500|$|At one point, The Edge of Nights {{audience}} {{was estimated to}} be more than 50% male, largely due to the show's crime format and its late start time of 4:30 PM (3:30 Central). In July 1963, the show was moved to the 3:30/2:30 time period after CBS gave the 4:30/3:30 slot back to the affiliates. The Edge of Night dominated the 3:30 slot even over otherwise-hit programs like NBC's You Don't Say! and ABC's Dark Shadows and One Life to Live. However, when the show moved to 2:30 PM (1:30 Central) on September 11, 1972, as per Procter and Gamble's insistence upon running all of its shows in a continuous daily marathon, it slid from a solid #2 in the Nielsen ratings to near-last; it has been hypothesized that the show suffered this sudden and drastic ratings plummet because many male viewers and teenagers were unable to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>home</b> from work or school earlier in the afternoon to watch. (This was not the only time that Procter & Gamble's insistence on a certain timeslot for one of their soaps caused a significant drop in ratings; the same problem affected the long-running Search for Tomorrow a decade later.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Taz {{appeared}} in [...] "The Looney Tunes Show" [...] episode [...] "Devil Dog" [...] voiced by Jim Cummings. In the show, he is portrayed walking on four legs {{like a real}} Tasmanian devil and his eyes are bloodshot red (later turned yellow when Bugs uses a taming trick that Speedy Gonzales taught him). Initially, Bugs believed Taz to be a dog and kept him as a house pet much to his roommate Daffy Duck's discomfort. Eventually, Bugs learned the truth and tried to return him {{to his home in}} Tasmania, only to find out that Taz would rather live with him, naming him [...] "Poochie". Taz subsequently appears in the following episodes [...] "The Foghorn Leghorn Story", [...] "Newspaper Thief", and [...] "Bugs and Daffy Get A Job". Taz later played a major part in [...] "Ridiculous Journey" [...] where he, Sylvester (who Taz tried to eat), and Tweety end up accidentally sent to Alaska by Yosemite Sam.
