500|$|Esther is {{introduced}} in press materials as being [...] "an innocent {{in a world}} of assassins, liars and zealots". Havins describes Drummond as [...] "an optimist and the glass is half full person". A promotional video released by Starz provided background information on Esther including her college education—the character introduces herself by stating that she has a BA in Linguistics and a Masters in Cognitive science. Series four writer Jane Espenson enjoyed writing for Esther as she felt the character to be most similar to herself. She notes that when devising Esther's backstory the writer's [...] "ended up just putting <b>my</b> <b>college</b> experience down." [...] Esther's introduction invites parallels that of lead female character Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) in the series' 2006 premiere episode [...] "Everything Changes"; she represents an audience surrogate for new American viewers. Havins refers to Esther as the [...] "tour guide" [...] for new viewers coming to Torchwood for the first time, one who is [...] "digging deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole". Despite similarities to their introduction, Havins comments that Esther as a character has a less action-orientated role than Gwen, being more the [...] "techie" [...] of the team who uses her intellect and technology as her weapons. The actress feels that Esther's desk-bound analyst position is [...] "her safe little world". Head writer and executive producer Russell T Davies described Esther as [...] "a very healing force" [...] in helping the other more outspoken characters gel together as a team because she is [...] "much more able to empathise with people." [...] The character's sister, Sarah Drummond (Candace Brown), recurs throughout Miracle Day, Havins feels that her presence helps [...] "humanise the situation" [...] as including family members helps the audience [...] "understand why people react a certain way." [...] Espenson notes that the first scene between Esther and Sarah was discussed at length at the writer's room—the writers chose to make Esther's choice whether or not to refer her ill sister to social services [...] "as difficult as possible" [...] to heighten the pain felt by the character.|$|E

2500|$|The {{week after}} the Ohio State game, Notre Dame faced Northwestern {{featuring}} All-American end Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

[...] Longfellow later recalled, [...] "Shakespeare and I played against each other for three years. [...] Each year, because of our names, we got a terrific buildup. It was a natural, I suppose. All through <b>my</b> <b>college</b> days I never heard the end of it. The writers went wilder each year." [...] Longfellow {{got the better of}} Shakespeare in 1935, as he caught a touchdown pass to help Northwestern win the game, 14-7. [...] Shakespeare attempted to lead the Irish to another come-from-behind victory, as he ran 48 yard to the Northwestern ten-yard line late in the game, but the Northwestern defense held. [...] On the last play of the game, Shakespeare threw a [...] "long, desperate pass", but it was intercepted as time ran out.|$|E

Apparently it has been used a lot and it was nice to hear. The ironic thing, though, is that the song was actually written for the fans. It was over six minutes long and was never meant to be a hit or anything like that. It was meant to be an opening for the 'live' show. We were putting out our third album and we wanted a really 'grand' opening for the show.

[...] The SCM conducted small study groups in which students were encouraged to discuss their beliefs freely and come to their own conclusions about how to interpret the Gospels. For Muriel, such discussions were unsettling and painful, yet also exciting. [...] "I had always before treated the Gospel as though its authors had set down day by day events in the life of Jesus as they happened," [...] she said. [...] "To face the implication that nothing was written down until after Jesus died was itself a shock. But this question of free and open discussion, that everything needed to be challenged, to be questioned, to be talked about, that was completely opposite to the authoritarian approach in the church." [...] The SCM study groups fostered independent thinking. [...] "This was the beginning of my adult search for truth," [...] Muriel told her biographer, [...] "and my sense that all things must be open to me." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 18, {{she left}} the family home for New York City and learned the trade of a vestmaker. She devoted her evenings to study and to writing. She contributed tales and {{sketches}} to various newspapers and magazines, but was not paid for them. She began to do reporting and book-reviewing for educational and literary journals, still without any pay in money, but happy at being occasionally paid in books. She said: [...] "It is <b>my</b> <b>college,</b> and I must learn my business before I can demand pay." [...] In 1856, she compiled a marbleworker's manual, such as had been issued in France, but although it was published, she again was given only books for compensation. As time went on, she received more and more literary work to do, and though still obliged at times to walk four miles for lack of horse-car fare, she made steady progress. She widened her circle of those friends who were beginning to appreciate her abilities. In 1859, she agreed to write a history of New York within a year, and succeeded in doing so; but even then, {{she was unable to}} support herself wholly, although she had given up vestmaking and was writing 12 hours a day. When she was 30 years old, she accepted the position of amanuensis to Dr. J. Marion Sims, and this was the first work of the kind for which she received steady payment. She was now able to do without her father's assistance, and live on her own resources in New York, though very plainly.|$|E

40|$|Abstract My {{scientific}} {{essay is}} built from two dilemmas which I have encountered in {{my role as}} a leisure time teacher. I have treated these two dilemmas with help from my mentor, classmates and the literature and tried to find new answers and approaches to them. My first dilemma comes from my role as a team leader, the power that I have over <b>my</b> <b>colleges</b> and the conflicts that can arise from my choices in my staff team. My second dilemma is about how one of <b>my</b> <b>colleges</b> handled a situation with a student when that students {{did not want to}} go to the music lesson. The dilemma between the pedagogue and the student originated from the pedagogue´s will to adapt the students time in school to the rest of the class even though the student doesn’t have the abilities for it.       My scientific essay begins with me trying to deal with the dilemmas that I have faced and if whether could have done anything different to achieve a more satisfactory result. Furthermore, I try to understand the conflicts that have emerged in my essay with help from different theoretical perspectives. Firstly, I look at how separation of powers in my dilemmas can be seen from a symmetrical relation between two equal persons. Secondly, with the premise from a concept of participation, I try to discern how positions of power can be expressed in a class of students. Thirdly, with the help of Michel Foucault´s concept of ratified normalization I will try to highlight how a school’s structure still strives to shape the students to fit the template designed by schools rather than allow the students to be themselves and trying to adapt the school around the students. Lastly, I try to focus my dilemmas on utilitarian and discursive ethics. Based on these two types of ethics I develop new approaches that in many ways have changed my thoughts and speculations regarding how an accurate procedure should have been carried out with respect to my dilemmas...|$|R
