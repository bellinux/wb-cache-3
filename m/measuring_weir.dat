40|$|This study {{comprises}} {{an investigation}} of the source and supply of coarse sediment input to a semi-arid channel reach. Despite a growing body of lIterature documentIng research of various aspects of sediment response in semi-arId areas, few studies attempt to integrate processes active in specific source areas wIth sediment supply to the channel. Detailed In the present study is an account of the processes active in the study area, identifIcation of source environments, a discussion of some of the factors affecting supply, a comparison of the effectiveness of gravItatIonal and fluvIal supply processes and an estImatIon of the time sequence of sediment supply to and removal from a channel reach. The above aspects of sediment supply are embodied In the aims set for the study. The study is conceptualIsed withIn the framework of a coarse sedIment supply model. The model is formulated from supporting literature and tested {{in the light of the}} results obtained through {{an investigation of}} the above aspects of sediment supply in the specIfic study area. The model is prImarily a qualitative one and the data collected intended to strengthen the qualitative nature of the model, while at the same time add at least some measure of quantification. Several reasons for studyIng coarse sediment behavIour in semI-arid areas are identIfied and include the need to improve the present lack of understanding of the relatIonship between supply and removal of sediment, the temporal dIstributIon of sediment discharge and the relatIve contrIbutions of coarse sediment to the overall load of rivers. The study area is located within the semi-arid Ecca basin north-east of Grahamstown. A specifIc channel reach is chosen withIn a sub-catchment (catchment B) of the Ecca catchment area as it has a variety of channel bank environments, is accessible through the entire reach, and the proximity of a raingauge and flow <b>measurIng</b> <b>weir</b> provide the necessary hydrometeorological inputs. The methods of observing sediment response from five data collection sites Include the use of slope or bank base sediment traps, erosion pins, tracer particle monitoring. sequential photographic surveys, and channel bed surface profile surveys. Hydrometeorological data is provided by records drawn from the data bank at the Hydrological Research Unit. Rhodes University. All rainfall records as well as channel flow data are available in the form of continuous records. Rainfall amount and intensity for any period could be extracted from these records. Data collection is confined to a period of two years, during which time the study area was visited on an approximate monthly basis. The index of erosivity (EI₃₀) could also be calculated from the hydrometeorological records and has been used as an integrated measure of rainfall intensity over the monthly period between site visits. The results are presented on a sample day for sample day basis. The sediment response data together with hydrological data is represented graphically for each sample day, of which there were nineteen. Discussion and interpretation of the results is left to a separate chapter. The interpretation of the results are based largely upon graphical representation of data time series and of interrelationships between some of the variables measured. The limited number of sample days together with the assumed auto correlation present in much of the data precluded the use of simple statistical testing procedures. The use of more complex procedures is not considered worthwhile and is unlikely to add to the interpretation of the results. Bedrock weathering is found to be a fairly active producer of coarse sediment on exposed shale bedrock outcrops through which sections of the channel are cut. The transport of the weathered detritus to the channel is attributed to a combination of gravitational and fluvial transport processes, with each process dominating at different times, depending on the magnitude of the climatic input. A tentative comparison of the effectiveness of the two processes reveals that both are capable of transporting similar amounts of sediment but on different time scales. The trends of sediment supply from the various bank environments display remarkable similarity, suggesting a measure of consistency of response to climatic input through the entire reach. Source areas of coarse sediment identified were limited to a small percentage of the total valley area and consisted almost entirely of the immediate channel environment. A tributary gully appears to be an important source of coarse sediment during fluvially dominated supply episodes, while the channel banks supply sediment on a quasi-continuous basis. The total yields for each source environment were extrapolated from the sampled amounts, revealing that channel banks are the predominant source environments. An attempt is made to assess the role of various factors which might affect sediment supply. The factors include rainfall amount and intensity, channel flow, geology/lithology, dip of strata, aspect of channel banks and size of weathered material. The findings, though not conclusive, do give some indication of the role of the above factors. It is suggested though that this particular aspect of sediment supply receive further attention in future research. Discussion on the time sequence of supply to and removal from the channel draws attention to a pulse- like movement of sediment 'waves' through the channel, and two scales of removal-accumulation cycles are identified. Finally the validity of the model is assessed and with the exception of a tributary inflow process not envisaged in the original model, is found to be an accurate representation of sediment supply in semi-arid areas, in both its static and dynamic phases. The suggestion is offered that future research on the sediment supply system, in all climatic regimes, can be conceptualised within the context of the basic model proposed in the present study. Specific components of the model should be quantified by numerous individual research efforts, and in this way, serve to build up the model into a widely applicable tool with which to interpret sediment suppl...|$|E

Each of the two study sites is located in a rural area, surrounded by agricultural fields, and an urban industrial area. Sensible and latent heat fluxes are analyzed according to the wind direction. In the summertime, when the wind blows from the river, sensible heat tends to decrease and latent heat tends to increase at both sites. This result is considered to be caused by moisture transfer from the river. Bowen ratio, energy balance closure, momentum flux, and stability are analyzed as well. The Bowen ratio of the rural agricultural site turns out higher than that of the urban site regardless of the season. The energy balance closure is higher at the agricultural site compared to the urban area, which is mainly due to exclusion of the storage term calculation at the urban site. The momentum flux is greater at the urban site both in winter and summer. The instability lasts longer during daytime and in the summertime, when there is a strong turbulence.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objectives}} {{of this article}} were: to test the hydrometric accuracy of some water level variation measuring and recording devices using a metal <b>measuring</b> tank with <b>weir,</b> and to automatically determine runoff intensities and elements. These field tests were performed {{in order to ensure}} high accuracy and low uncertainty of studies at hydrological micro-scale (plot scale). Hydrometric tests targeted two level measurement conditions: (i) rise and storage - without overflowing, volumetric measurement V= f (H); and (ii) rise and overflowing, weir measurement Q = f (H). Hydrometric accuracy was evaluated by comparing the measured and recorded level using three instruments with a tell-tale level. This field experiment was conducted in Voineşti Experimental Basin, belonging to the National Institute of Hydrology and Water Management. Levels series data were processed with the software application ParExp v 1, in order to automatically convert them into discharges (Q). Hydrometric and hydrological test results highlighted certain aspects. The accuracy estimated for water fluctuation measurement and recording instruments in a weir water tank, for both level measurement conditions revealed accuracy errors (insufficient accuracy) when the runoff hydraulics was changed (storage Qacum ÷ overflowing Qdev). To remedy such instrumental deficiencies, a metrological control shall be performed under specific operational conditions (e. g., water tank) in order to meet increasing needs for high quality hydrological data. The hydrological data processing using the ParExp v 1 software application, at the junction of specific “rise and storage” and “rise and overflowing” flows indicated a temporal error (delay). The user may remedy this error by eliminating data from the Qacum-Qdev junction range until reaching the maximum/stabilized level. Finally, we estimate that through the improvement of some technical elements, hydrological data obtained at a micro-scale level can be used for hydrological models of calibration...|$|R

We studied storm {{discharges}} of nitrate and dissolved and particulate {{forms of}} ammonium, organic N, phosphate, and organic P from four adjacent small watersheds of differing land {{use on the}} Atlantic Coastal Plain in Maryland. We used V-notch weirs and automated storm samplers to measure discharges and collect samples at flow intervals during 76 storms. The watershed aquifers are perched on an impervious clay layer slightly above sea level, so that combined groundwater and surface water discharges were <b>measured</b> at the <b>weirs.</b> The concentrations of particulate forms of organic N (PON), organic P (POP), and inorganic P (PPi) increased up to 3 orders of magnitude during storm events and usually peaked prior to the peak water discharge, while concentrations of dissolved forms of organic N (DON), organic P (DOP), inorganic P (DPi), and nitrate did not change very much. Dissolved and particulate ammonium (DNH 4 and PNH 4, respectively) concentrations increased up to fivefold in storm events but remained low compared to other N forms. The watershed with the most cropland discharged the highest concentrations of total N, PON, DNH 4, nitrate, POP, and PPi. A forested watershed discharged the highest concentrations of DON, PNH 4, and DOP. The watershed with the most grazed land discharged the highest concentration of DPi. PON and POP were the dominant forms of N and P in storm discharges from all watersheds. Concentrations of nitrogen were higher in spring and summer storms than in winter storms, but phosphorus concentrations were much higher in the summer storms than in spring or winter. The concentrations of PPi, POP, PON, DNH 4, and PNH 4 increased significantly with peak water discharge among storms, while concentrations of DPi, DOP, DON, and nitrate {{were not correlated with}} peak discharge.

That {{is the reason why}} there has been put a lot of emphasis on creating fish pass in rivers in recent years. Between the years 2012 and 2013 there were carried out investigations on the new slit fish pass on the Jizera River in Turnov. The aim was to assess the technical realization of the construction of fish pass and functionality for local ichthyofauna. Primarily we have focused on hydraulic conditions in the fish pass (water flow, velocity, level differences in all chambers). During the fish pass technical inspection the fish was being caught by electric aggregate. The species composition of fish was also <b>measured</b> in the <b>weir.</b> Catching weir was used to catch the counter-migrating fish through the fish pass. The caught fish was taken its body length in mm and weight in grams and subsequently was calculated numerical dominance, diversity and evenness. There were 519 pieces of fish caught weighing 6. 395 kg in total. There was confirmed presence of 10 species of fish in the fish pass, while in the weir were found 3 more species of fish and 1 species of lamprey. Reproductive migration was confirmed for brown trout and minnow. Roach, dace, perch and chub have settled down in the resting chambers permanently. There have been found several defects in the fish pass. There have been found large differences between the levels of chambers, high flow rates, reduced light penetration of the water in the fish pass, lack of entry attractiveness of the fish pass and non-minimum residual flows. Fish passage is considerably clogged by suspended dirt and the cleaning possibility is limited. Functionality and selectivity of the fish passage has not been demonstrated.

40|$|AbstractTo help achieve {{effective}} longitudinal river connectivity, {{evaluation of}} the efficacy of fishway use by upstream-migrating fishes is needed. Larinier super active baffle (SAB) fishways are relatively cheap retrofit fish passes, suitable for low-head barriers, widespread in Europe and the most commonly fitted technical pass in Britain. Their suitability for non-salmonids, however, is poorly quantified. The efficacy of a 15 % gradient SAB fishway and effects of flow regime and water temperature were tested for European river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis) using passive integrated transponder (PIT) and acoustic telemetry at a Crump weir on the River Derwent, Northeast England. In migration season 2013 – 14, {{over a wide range}} of flows, 90. 1 % of 350 tagged lamprey entered the fishway. One fish (0. 3 %) of those that entered the pass ascended successfully, even though measured water velocity was within laboratory-measured performance conditions for this species. Of 29 acoustic-tagged lamprey that visited the weir over the same period, four (13. 8 %) ascended it directly, during elevated flows. These data suggest that high turbulence and/or the physical characteristics of baffles may inhibit lamprey ascent of the pass. In migration season 2014 – 15, we tested the effect of adding studded modular plastic tiles adjacent to the fishway wall, employing PIT antennas separately interrogating the entrance and exit of each of the main fishway and tile routes. 85. 8 % (169) of 197 tagged lamprey entered the fishway, of which 72 / 169 (42. 6 %) entered the tile entrance. Passage efficiency of entrants was 7. 1 % (12 / 169), all of which used the tiled route. Reduced local flow velocity in combination with increased availability of resting habitat within the tiles may have facilitated increased passage. Although fishway passage efficiency increased after placement of the modular tiles, it remained half that <b>measured</b> for direct <b>weir</b> passage, both of which are inadequate for connectivity restoration. Quantitative tests of studded tiles placed on the sloping downstream weir face by comparison to control conditions may be more effective and are needed. This study demonstrates the importance of carrying out full-scale field tests to supplement possible solutions developed under laboratory conditions...|$|R
5000|$|Earth <b>Measure</b> by Matt <b>Weir,</b> 2013 - Weir {{created the}} {{sculpture}} {{in honor of}} Barry Bingham Jr.'s life and service. Bingham, the former publisher of the Louisville Courier-Journal and Louisville Times who guided the publications to win three Pulitzer Prizes, was also an avid environmentalist, photographer, and supporter of Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest. He served on the Bernheim Board of Trustees from 1970 to 2006 and chaired the capital campaign for the Platium LEED Visitor Center and related projects. Constructed entirely {{out of more than}} a ton of solid stacked limestone blocks, Earth Measure will beckon the visitor to explore notions of science, geometry, sound, and architecture while deepening one's connection with nature. When Weir was commissioned three years ago to create a sculpture, he looked beyond designing a traditional sculptural tribute. By researching Bingham and conducting interviews, Weir dug deep into the principles that were important to both Barry Bingham Jr. and to Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest. Bingham appreciated nature, the environment and was passionate about its preservation. He believed that there was nothing more important than public service. He had a strong commitment to supporting the education, research and protecting the land that constitutes Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest. He also believed that photography and art were important means of capturing and appreciating nature as we know it.Earth Measure is an educational, interactive and multi-dimensional earthwork that must be experienced to be appreciated. It poses questions on the fundamental forms of the circle, square and triangle. It invites discovery by all ages both physically and intellectually. It places the visitor in a meadow and beckons them to tune into acoustic ecology and soundscape science. In other words, the sculpture both frames the environment through its [...] "lens" [...] and captures the sounds of seasonal wildlife through audio waves directed {{to the center of the}} listening dome or parabolic sphere. It is simultaneously simple and complex, scientific and artistic, monumental and graceful. Earth Measure also fulfills Isaac Wolfe Bernheim's deepest intention for the gift he gave the people of Kentucky, when he established the arboretum and research forest. It creates an inspirational and uniquely contemplative space, or stage, as it were, for people to connect deeply with nature.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Side weir {{structures}} are extensively used in hydraulic engineering, irrigation and environmental engineering, and it usually {{consists of a}} main weir and a lateral channel. Side weirs are also used as an emergency structure. This structure is installed on one side or {{both sides of the}} main channel to divert the flow from the main channel to the side channel. Lateral outflow takes place when the water surface in the main channel rises above the weir sill. Flow over a side weir is a typical case of spatially varied flow with decreasing discharge. There have been extensive studies on side weir overflows. Most of the previous theoretical analysis and experimental research works are related to the flow over rectangular side weirs in rectangular main channels. In the current study, the flow conditions over a trapezoidal side weir located in a rectangular main channel in subcritical flow regime is considered. Materials and Methods: The experiments were performed in a rectangular open channel having provisions for a side weir at one side of the channel. The main channel was horizontal with 12 m length, 0. 25 m width, and 0. 5 m height, and it was installed on a frame; lateral channel that has a length of 6 m, width of 0. 25 m, and height of 1 m. It was set up parallel to the main channel; walls and its bed were made up of Plexiglas plates. The side weir was positioned at a distance of 6 m from the channel’s entrance. A total of 121 experiments on trapezoidal side weirs were carried out. Results and Discussion: For trapezoidal side weir, effective non-dimensionnal parameters were identified using dimensional analysis and Buckingham's Pi-Theorem. Finally, the following non-dimensional parameters were considered as the most effective ones on the discharge coefficient of the trapezoidal side weir flow. in which Fr 1 = upstream Froude number, P= hight of the trapezoidal side weir, y 1 = upstream water depth, z=side slope of the trapezoidal side weir and T=top flow width of the trapezoidal side weir. Water surface profiles were <b>measured</b> along the <b>weir</b> crest, the main channel centerline, and far from the weir section. Different elevations in water surface profile depend on the upstream Froude number in the main channel; depth differences in low Froude numbers are at minimum values, and in high Froude numbers are at maximum amounts. The water surface level along the crest drops at the entrance of the side weir to {{the first half of the}} side weir; and it has been attributed to the side weir entrance effect at the upstream. Afterwards, the water level rises towards the downstream of the weir. According to the experimental results, measurements of the water in the centerline of the main channel are reliable and water surface drop is negligible. According to the parameters affecting the discharge coefficient for each value of z, discharge coefficient equations were developed with acceptable accuracy such that the effects of this parameter were shown separately. Finally, the general equation was proposed. The general functional form for discharge coefficient is presented as follows where the effect of the side slope parameter, z, is also considered. The mean and maximum percentage errors of the discharge coefficient computed using the proposed equation are as 2. 6...|$|R

Journal of Soil Science, 41 (2), 189 - 198. A {{study of the}} leaching of sulphate, chloride, nitrate and the associated cations was carried out over two winter periods on three mole-drained paddocks on a yellow-grey earth (Tokomaru silt loam). The paddocks were occasionally grazed by sheep. At {{the beginning of each}} drainage season potassium chloride (KCl) and sulphur fertilizer, as either single superphosphate (SSP) or elemental sulphur (S°), were applied to two of the paddocks, while the third served as a control. The amount of KCl applied was 200 kg ha- 1 yr- 1, while sulphur was applied at 50 kg S ha- 1 in 1988 and 30 kg S ha- 1 1989. Drain flow from the fertilized paddocks was <b>measured</b> with V-notch <b>weirs,</b> and sampled using proportional samplers. Large differences in the total drainage flow were measured in the two years, with values of approximately 280 mm in 1988 and 110 mm in 1989. Significant amounts of the chloride added through both fertilizer and rainfall were leached, amounting to approximately 105 kg Cl ha- 1 yr- 1. The leaching of sulphate-S depended on the form of S fertilizer applied, the quantity of drainage, and the rate of mineralization. Leaching losses of 17 and 3. 4 kg S ha- 1 were measured from the SSP and S° fertilized paddocks, respectively, in 1988, and 9. 4 and 3. 5 kg S ha- 1 in 1989. The study showed that applying SSP just before the drainage season increased leaching losses of sulphate-S substantially. Although the particle sizes of S° used in both years were much bigger than those specified by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries of New Zealand, there appeared to be no difference in the yield response to S applied either as SSP or as S°. The reduced leaching of S when applied as S° resulted from the slow oxidation of S° to sulphate-S. Relatively little nitrate-N was leached, the amount ranging from 11 to 17 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1. Losses of potassium were less than 10 kg K ha- 1 yr- 1, despite the large quantity applied as KCl fertilizer immediately before winter. However a large amount of calcium was leached, between 31 and 52 kg ha- 1 yr- 1. The amount of magnesium leached was between 9 and 15 kg ha- 1 yr- 1. A considerable quantity of sodium was leached, around 58 kg ha- 1 in 1988, and 31 kg Na ha- 1 in 1989, roughly equal to the input in rainfall. Good mass balances were obtained for both chloride and sulphate. The measured moles of negative and positive charge from cations and anions in the leachate were also almost equal. Three models were developed for the leaching of chloride and sulphate-S. An approach dividing the soil water into mobile-immobile phases, and using a fairly detailed soil water flow model was developed. The model was able to simulate the concentration of chloride in the drainage closely, even just after the application of chloride fertilizer, and during highly preferential flow conditions induced by heavy rain. A transfer function model, assuming a log-normal probability density function (pdf) of solute travel pathway lengths, was able to simulate the leaching of chloride reasonably well in 1988. The prediction was less satisfactory in 1989 and during highly preferential flow. By adapting the pdf for chloride to sulphate and by taking adsorption of sulphate into account, the model could predict the sulphate concentration in the drainage quite successfully. A simpler model, using the idea that the two-dimensional flow geometry to the mole drain implies that the drainage concentration approximately equals the average soil solution concentration, was also developed. Despite its simplicity it was able to simulate the leaching of chloride and sulphate as well as the transfer function model. Irrespective of the model being used, the net mineralization rate of soil organic sulphur emerged as an important factor in predicting the leaching of sulphate...|$|R
