5|$|Biomes {{are larger}} units of {{organization}} that categorize {{regions of the}} Earth's ecosystems, mainly according to the structure and composition of vegetation. There are different methods to define the continental boundaries of biomes dominated by different functional types of vegetative communities that are limited in distribution by climate, precipitation, weather and other environmental variables. Biomes include tropical rainforest, temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, temperate deciduous forest, taiga, tundra, hot desert, and polar desert. Other researchers have recently categorized other biomes, such as the human and oceanic microbiomes. To a microbe, {{the human body is}} a habitat and a landscape. Microbiomes were discovered largely through advances in molecular genetics, which have revealed a hidden richness of <b>microbial</b> <b>diversity</b> on the planet.

Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has long been an important model organism for the eukaryotic cell, while the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been a very important tool (notably in early pre-molecular genetics). The worm Caenorhabditis elegans is an often used simple model for multicellular organisms. The zebrafish Brachydanio rerio is used for many developmental studies on the molecular level, and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana is a model organism for flowering plants. [...] The Japanese pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes) and the spotted green pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis) are interesting because of their small and compact genomes, which contain very little noncoding DNA compared to most species. The mammals dog (Canis familiaris), brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), mouse (Mus musculus), and chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) are all important model animals in medical research.|$|E

Given the {{importance}} of microbial communities in driving soil nutrient cycling, it is of interest to document the microbial biogeographic pattern here. We adopted a microarray-based tool named GeoChip 4. 0 to investigate grassland microbial functional genes along an elevation gradient from 3200 to 3800 m above sea level open to free grazing by local herdsmen and wild animals.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{advent of}} {{molecular}} techniques in microbial ecology has aroused interest in gaining an {{understanding about the}} spatial distribution of regional pools of soil microbes and the main drivers responsible of these spatial patterns. Here, we assessed the distribution of crenarcheal, bacterial and fungal communities in an alpine landscape displaying high turnover in plant species over short distances. Our aim {{is to determine the}} relative contribution of plant species composition, environmental conditions, and geographic isolation on microbial community distribution. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Eleven types of habitats that best represent the landscape heterogeneity were investigated. Crenarchaeal, bacterial and fungal communities were described by means of Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism. Relationships between <b>microbial</b> beta <b>diversity</b> patterns were examined by using Bray-Curtis dissimilarities and Principal Coordinate Analyses. Distance-based redundancy analyses and variation partitioning were used to estimate the relative contributions of different drivers on <b>microbial</b> beta <b>diversity.</b> <b>Microbial</b> communities tended to be habitat-specific and did not display significant spatial autocorrelation. <b>Microbial</b> beta <b>diversity</b> correlated with soil pH. Fungal beta-diversity was mainly related to soil organic matter. Though the effect of plant species composition was significant for all microbial groups, it was much stronger for Fungi. In contrast, geographic distances did not have any effect on <b>microbial</b> beta <b>diversity.</b> CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: <b>Microbial</b> communities exhibit non-random spatial patterns of diversity in alpine landscapes.

Little is known, however, about the factors that determine soil <b>microbial</b> community functional <b>diversity</b> at a larger spatial scale. Here we conducted a regional scale study to assess the driving forces governing soil <b>microbial</b> community functional <b>diversity</b> in a temperate steppe of Hulunbeir, Inner Mongolia, northern China. Redundancy analysis and regression analysis were {{used to examine the}} relationships between soil microbial community properties and environmental variables. The results showed that the functional <b>diversity</b> of soil <b>microbial</b> communities was correlated with aboveground plant biomass, root biomass, soil water content and soil N: P ratio, suggesting that plant biomass, soil water availability and soil N availability were major determinants of soil <b>microbial</b> community functional <b>diversity.</b> Since plant biomass can indicate resource availability, which is mainly constrained by soil water availability and N availability in temperate steppes, we consider that soil <b>microbial</b> community functional <b>diversity</b> was mainly controlled by resource availability in temperate steppes at a regional scale.

40|$|Soil properties, enzyme activity, and <b>microbial</b> {{functional}} <b>diversity</b> coevolve with soil processes. Consequently, {{activity and}} diversity of soil enzymes {{could be used for}} evaluating the natural processes in ecosystems and their changes but, for applied management strategies, useful cost-effective methods and synthetic indicators are required. The aim {{of this study was to}} use API ZYM (API) assay to evaluate the fingerprint of soil enzyme activity and <b>microbial</b> functional <b>diversity</b> in relation to soil processes. To strengthen the results, a parallel measurement of enzyme activities was performed with microplate-fluorometric (FA) assay. Seven soil profiles classified as Haploxeralf, located in two Mediterranean areas under xeric moisture and mesic temperature soil regimes, were selected. The Synthetic Enzyme Index (SEI) was calculated as the sum of 16 enzyme activities determined according to the two methods (SEI–API and SEI–FA). Moreover, the enzyme activities were used to assess the <b>microbial</b> functional <b>diversity</b> through the calculation of the Shannon’s diversity index (H’ API and H’ FA). The results showed a relationship between SEI–API and SEI–FA which was described by a linear model. Moreover, a significant linear regression was also found between the Shannon’s diversity indices calculated according to the two methods, H’ API and H’ FA. Significant differences were found from surface A to deep Bt genetic horizons in a decreasing gradient of enzyme activity and <b>microbial</b> functional <b>diversity.</b> For subsurface horizons, the SEI–API was significantly higher in E than AB horizons, suggesting that API method can detect the different biochemical behaviour in eluviation processes occurring in Haploxeralfs. API ZYM assay proved to be suitable for a general biochemical evaluation and for assessing <b>microbial</b> functional <b>diversity</b> in soils of different origin, composition, and land uses. For this reason, it can be proposed as a simple cost-effective method to use during the soil survey.

Their biosynthesis {{serves as a}} model system for understanding the evolution of secondary metabolism. <b>Microbial</b> carotenoid <b>diversity</b> and evolution has hitherto been analyzed primarily from structural and biosynthetic perspectives, with the few phylogenetic analyses of microbial carotenoid biosynthetic proteins using either used limited datasets or lacking methodological rigor. Given the recent accumulation of microbial genome sequences, a reappraisal of <b>microbial</b> carotenoid biosynthetic <b>diversity</b> and evolution {{from the perspective of}} comparative genomics is warranted to validate and complement models of <b>microbial</b> carotenoid <b>diversity</b> and evolution based upon structural and biosynthetic data. Methodology/Principal Findings: Comparative genomics were used to identify and analyze in silico microbial carotenoid biosynthetic pathways. Four major phylogenetic lineages of carotenoid biosynthesis are suggested composed of: (i) Proteobacteria; (ii) Firmicutes; (iii) Chlorobi, Cyanobacteria and photosynthetic eukaryotes; and (iv) Archaea, Bacteroidetes and two separate sub-lineages of Actinobacteria. Using this phylogenetic framework, specific evolutionary mechanisms are proposed for carotenoid desaturase CrtI-family enzymes and carotenoid cyclases. Several phylogenetic lineage-specific evolutionary mechanisms are also suggested, including: (i) horizontal gene transfer; (ii) gene acquisition followed by differential gene loss; (iii) co-evolution with other biochemical structures such as proteorhodopsins; and (iv) positiv...|$|R

In addition, we assessed {{the importance of the}} quantity and quality (indicated by labile soil organic matter fractions) of soil organic matter in small-scale structuring of soil <b>microbial</b> metabolic functional <b>diversity.</b> <b>Microbial</b> metabolic functional <b>diversity</b> was characterized based on the Biolog profile.

All soil organic matter fractions including total soil organic matter, dissolved organic matter, particulate organic matter explained 15 - 27 % of the variance in <b>microbial</b> functional <b>diversity</b> in the two soil layers. Among all soil organic matter fractions, the labile dissolved organic carbon accounted for the largest amount of variation.
