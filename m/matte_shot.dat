5|$|Any time deep {{focus was}} impossible—as {{in the scene}} in which Kane {{finishes}} a negative review of Susan's opera {{while at the same}} time firing the person who began writing the review—an optical printer was used to make the whole screen appear in focus, visually layering one piece of film onto another. However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of in-camera effects, as in the famous scene in which Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera <b>matte</b> <b>shot.</b> The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.|$|E
5|$|The special {{visual effects}} for Raiders were {{provided}} by Industrial Light & Magic and include: a <b>matte</b> <b>shot</b> to establish the Pan Am flying boat {{in the water and}} miniature work to show the plane taking off and flying, superimposed over a map; animation effects for the beam in the Tanis map room; and a miniature car and passengers superimposed over a matte painting for a shot of a Nazi car being forced off a cliff. The bulk of effects shots were featured in the climactic sequence wherein the Ark of the Covenant (which was designed by Brian Muir and Keith Short) is opened and God's wrath is unleashed. This sequence featured animation, a woman to portray a beautiful spirit's face, rod puppet spirits moved through water to convey a sense of floating, a matte painting of the island, and cloud tank effects to portray clouds. The melting of Toht's head was done by exposing a gelatine and plaster model of Ronald Lacey's head to a heat lamp with an under-cranked camera, while Dietrich's crushed head was a hollow model from which air was withdrawn. When the film was originally submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America, it received an R rating because of the scene in which Belloq's head explodes. The filmmakers were able to receive a PG rating when they added a veil of fire over the exploding head scene. (PG-13 rating was not created until 1984.) The firestorm that cleanses the canyon at the finish was a miniature canyon filmed upside down.|$|E
50|$|Dawn {{combined}} {{his experience}} with the glass shot with the techniques of the <b>matte</b> <b>shot.</b> Up until this time, the <b>matte</b> <b>shot</b> was essentially a double-exposure: {{a section of the}} camera's field would be blocked with a piece of cardboard to block the exposure, the film would be rewound, and the blocked part would also be shot in live action. Dawn instead used pieces of glass with sections painted black (which was more effective at absorbing light than cardboard), and transferred the film to a second, stationary camera rather than merely rewinding the film. The matte painting was then drawn to exactly match the proportion and perspective to the live action shot. The low cost and high quality of Dawn's <b>matte</b> <b>shot</b> made it the mainstay in special effects cinema throughout the century.|$|E

50|$|Norman O. Dawn (25 May 1884 in Argentina - 2 February 1975 in Santa Monica, California) was {{an early}} film director. He made several {{improvements}} on the <b>matte</b> <b>shot</b> to apply it to motion picture, {{and was the first}} director to use rear projection in cinema.|$|E
5000|$|For decades, {{travelling}} <b>matte</b> <b>shots</b> {{had to be}} done [...] "locked-down", so {{that neither}} the matted subject nor the background could shift their camera perspective at all.

50|$|A {{miniature}} {{effect is}} a special effect created for motion pictures and television programs using scale models. Scale models are often combined with high speed photography or <b>matte</b> <b>shots</b> to make gravitational and other effects appear convincing to the viewer.

5000|$|From 1910 to 1920, {{the main}} {{innovations}} in special effects were the improvements on the <b>matte</b> <b>shot</b> by Norman Dawn. With the original <b>matte</b> <b>shot,</b> pieces of cardboard were placed {{to block the}} exposure of the film, which would be exposed later. Dawn combined this technique with the [...] "glass shot." [...] Rather than using cardboard to block {{certain areas of the}} film exposure, Dawn simply painted certain areas black to prevent any light from exposing the film. From the partially exposed film, a single frame is then projected onto an easel, where the matte is then drawn. By creating the matte from an image directly from the film, it became incredibly easy to paint an image with proper respect to scale and perspective (the main flaw of the glass shot). Dawn's technique became the textbook for matte shots due to the natural images it created.|$|E

50|$|Much of {{the film}} was shot on {{location}} on the Greek Saronic Islands, notably Hydra. Establishing shots of Athens, Rhodes and Delos add to the vérité, while <b>matte</b> <b>shots</b> and some interiors were done at Cinecittà in Rome. One scene uses the Eastern Orthodox monastery complex at Metéora, which was later used as a location in the James Bond film For Your Eyes Only.|$|R
50|$|The in-camera <b>matte</b> <b>shot</b> {{remained}} in use until the film stock {{began to go}} up in quality in the 1920s. During this time a new technique known as the bi-pack camera method was developed. This was similar to the in-camera <b>matte</b> <b>shot,</b> but relied on one master positive as a backup. This way if anything was lost, the master would still be intact. Around 1925 another method of making a matte was developed. One of the drawbacks of the old mattes was that the matte line was stationary. There could be no direct contact between the live action and the matte background. The traveling matte changed that. The traveling matte was like an in-camera or bi-pack matte, except that the matte line changed every frame. Filmmakers could use a technique similar to the bi-pack method to make the live action portion a matte itself, allowing them to move the actors around the background and scene - integrating them completely. The Thief of Bagdad (1940) represented a major leap forward for the traveling matte and the first major introduction of the bluescreen technique invented by Larry Butler when it won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects that year, though the process was still very time-intensive, and each frame had to be hand-processed.|$|E
50|$|By the mid-1980s, advancements in {{computer}} graphics programs allowed matte painters {{to work in}} the digital realm. The first digital <b>matte</b> <b>shot</b> was created by painter Chris Evans in 1985 for Young Sherlock Holmes for a scene featuring a computer-graphics (CG) animation of a knight leaping from a stained-glass window. Evans first painted the window in acrylics, then scanned the painting into LucasFilm’s Pixar system for further digital manipulation. The computer animation (another first) blended perfectly with the digital matte, which could not have been accomplished using a traditional matte painting.|$|E
50|$|Dawn's {{first film}} Missions of California made {{extensive}} use of the glass shot, in which certain things are painted {{on a piece of}} glass and placed in between the camera and the live action. Many of the buildings which Dawn was filming were at least partially destroyed; by painting sections of roof or walls, the impression was made that the buildings were in fact, whole. The main difference between the glass shot and the <b>matte</b> <b>shot</b> is that with a glass shot, all filming is done with a single exposure of film.|$|E

We needed to {{decelerate}} the action. I did a few more <b>matte</b> <b>shots</b> to slow it down. We made it a little bit slower, by putting breathing room back in so there'd be a two-hour oxygen supply for the audience." ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{his return}} from India, Beddoes was loaned by Technicolor to Michael Powell to work in Madrid {{for almost a year}} onHoneymoon [...] He {{designed}} sets and all of the costumes for the ballets, El Amor Brujo and Los Amantes de Teruel, as well as painting the <b>matte</b> <b>shots.</b> He collaborated twice more with Michael Powell on projected films, Hassan in 1959 and The Tempest in 1973; neither of these films were made.|$|R
50|$|The closing <b>matte</b> <b>shot</b> {{featuring}} {{all nine}} brothers standing {{side by side}} took careful planning to expose perfectly, giving the effect of three Moes, Larrys and Joes. To achieve this, each Stooge had to stand behind a specific marker before each shot was taken. For the final exposure, director Jules White suspected that Larry Fine was standing behind the wrong marker {{when compared to the}} previous two exposures. Larry knew White was wrong, and {{went to great lengths to}} prove it. Luckily, Larry prevailed, and saved the studio from having to refilm thousands of dollars worth of exposures.|$|E
50|$|In 1979, Danforth was hired, {{along with}} Rick Baker, to design effects for Edward Pressman's {{proposed}} production Conan. This film mutated {{into a different}} version (Conan the Barbarian, 1982), with which neither Danforth nor Baker were involved. Although Danforth was not firstly involved on the visual effects of the John Milius project, he was hired to paint a <b>matte</b> <b>shot</b> during postproduction. He executed a matte painting for the penultimate shot of the film, showing Conan and the princess walking down toward {{a painting of a}} landscape valley. Danforth also provided a matte painting for the little-known film, The Day Time Ended.|$|E

50|$|Over the {{following}} years, the Schüfftan process {{was used by}} many other film-makers, including Alfred Hitchcock, in his films Blackmail (1929) and The 39 Steps (1935), and as recently as The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), directed by Peter Jackson. The Schüfftan process has largely been replaced with <b>matte</b> <b>shots,</b> which allow the two portions of the image to be filmed at different times and give opportunities for more changes in post production.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first use}} of the process was in the J. Arthur Rank Organisation's Plain Sailing in 1956. [...] It was used in Disney films The Parent Trap, Mary Poppins and Bedknobs and Broomsticks. It was also used for the Ray Harryhausen film Mysterious Island, {{produced}} by Columbia Pictures. Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds (produced by Universal Studios) used yellow screen, {{under the direction of}} Disney animator Ub Iwerks, in traveling <b>matte</b> <b>shots</b> with birds' rapidly fluttering wings.|$|R
50|$|The {{first major}} {{development}} of the <b>matte</b> <b>shot</b> was the early 1900s by Norman Dawn ASC. Dawn had seamlessly woven glass shots into many of his films: such as the crumbling California Missions in the movie Missions of California, and used the glass shot to revolutionize the in-camera matte. Now, instead of taking their live action footage to a real location, filmmakers would shoot the live action as before with the cut-out cards in place, then rewind the film and transfer it to a camera designed to minimize vibrations. Then the filmmakers would shoot a glass shot instead of a live action background. The resulting composite was of fairly high quality, since the matte line - the place of transition from the live action to the painted background - was much less jumpy. In addition, the new in-camera matte was much more cost effective, as the glass didn’t {{have to be ready}} the day the live action was shot. One downside to this method was that since the film was exposed twice, there was always the risk of accidentally overexposing the film and ruining the footage filmed earlier.|$|E
5000|$|Mattes are a {{very old}} technique, {{going back to the}} Lumière brothers. Originally, the <b>matte</b> <b>shot</b> was created by filmmakers {{obscuring}} their backgrounds with cut-out cards. When the live action portion of a scene was filmed, the background portion of the film wasn’t exposed. Once the live action was filmed, a different cut-out would be placed over the live action. The film would be rewound, and the filmmakers would film their new background. This technique was known as the in-camera matte and was considered more a novelty than a serious special effect during the late 1880s. [...] A good early American example is seen in The Great Train Robbery (1903) where it is used to place a train outside a window in a ticket office, and later a moving background outside a baggage car on a train 'set'. Around this time, another technique known as the glass shot was also being used. The glass shot was made by painting details on a piece of glass which was then combined with live action footage to create the appearance of elaborate sets. The first glass shots are credited to Edgar Rogers.|$|E
50|$|The in-camera <b>matte</b> <b>shot,</b> {{also known}} as the Dawn Process is created by first {{mounting}} a piece of glass in front of the camera. Black paint is applied to the glass where the background will be replaced. The actors are then filmed with minimal sets. The director shoots several minutes of extra footage to be used as test strips. The matte painter then develops a test strip (with the blacked out areas in the shot) and projects a frame of the 'Matted' shot onto the easel mounted glass. This test footage clip is used as the reference to paint the background or scenery to be matted in on a new piece of glass. The live action part of the glass is painted black, more of the test footage is then exposed to adjust and confirm color matching and edge line up. Then the critical parts of the matted live action scene (with the desired actions and actors in place) are threaded up for burning the painted elements into the black areas. The flat black paint put on the glass blocks light from the part of the film it covers, preventing double exposure over the latent live action scenes from occurring.|$|E

50|$|Hopkirk's {{appearances}} {{were achieved}} by the simplest and cheapest of means, which had been in use since {{the earliest days of}} cinema. While the camera remained static, the other actors would freeze, Kenneth Cope would enter the scene and the other actors would unfreeze. Cutting out the extraneous footage in between was all that was necessary. Disappearances used the same method in reverse. Optical effects, which were prohibitively expensive and time-consuming at the time, were largely avoided, although superimposition or bluescreen travelling <b>matte</b> <b>shots</b> were very occasionally used. In at least one scene, the Victorian theatrical illusion Pepper's Ghost was used.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the years}} since its release, The Mighty Gorga has {{received}} overwhelmingly poor reviews. Many critics have slated Gorga himself as being too obviously {{a man in a}} gorilla costume as well as the appearance of a plastic hand-held dinosaur. Mention has also been made of the film's poor plotting, slow pace and acting (indeed, many lines are flubbed during the film without being reshot). Other criticisms include the use of unrealistic <b>matte</b> <b>shots</b> to depict the Gorga and the obvious use of stock film. A number of reviewers have said that the film is so bad that it becomes a [...] "must-see", while others argue that the film has no merit whatsoever.|$|R
