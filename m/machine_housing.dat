40|$|ABSTRACT. We develop simple {{models that}} can be used to predict the forces of impact that occur during the {{injection}} molding process involving a magnesium alloy. We model the impact of the injection molding screw tip on the molten material entering the mold, and the impact of the piston flange on the <b>machine</b> <b>housing,</b> which can occur when the amount of material that has been injected into the mold is insufficient to completely fill the mold. We consider the effects due to the elasticity of the molten material and machine parts, those due to the presence of a thin film of hydraulic fluid between the piston flange and <b>machine</b> <b>housing,</b> the variation of the viscosity of the hydraulic fluid, and those due to the leakage of molten metal past the screw tip. With the simple models developed here, an injection molding machine designer can predict how varying the process parameters may affect the impact forces, and thus, may be able to more efficiently design the machine so that damage is less likely to occur during operation. This will result a longer life for the machine, which will lead to increased cost effectiveness for the manufacturer...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Many times {{engineers}} want to animate {{an operating}} deflection shapes (ODS) {{model of a}} machine with more points then have been actually measured. It makes for a more realistic looking model to clarify the motions. For frequencies below the first mode frequency of the <b>machine</b> <b>housing,</b> {{it is reasonable to}} assert that the machine component, e. g., a motor, pump, generator, moves a rigid body. In this frequency range, each rigid body has three centroidal linear and angular accelerations, velocities, or displacements. These can be determined ideally with only six motion measurements. The angular motions will be small and thus commutative. This allows one to calculate the motions of every point in the rigid body. This paper presents a method of measuring and computing the six centroidal motion components for each rigid body, and building on previous work on doing ODS with MA TLAB, shows how to calculate, draw, and animate the rigid body motions in MATLAB...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, two Piezo-Based Rotating Inertial Actuators (PBRIAs) are {{considered}} for {{the suppression of the}} structure-borne noise radiated from rotating machinery. Each inertial actuator comprises a piezoelectric stack element shunted with the Antoniou’s gyrator circuit. This type of electrical circuit can be used to emulate a variable inductance. By varying the shunt inductance it is possible to realise two tuneable vibration neutralisers to suppress tonal frequency vibrations of a slowly rotating machine. Also, reductions in the noise radiated from the <b>machine</b> <b>housing</b> can be achieved. First a theoretical study is performed using a simplified lumped parameter model of the system at hand. The simplified model consists of a rotating shaft and two perpendicularly mounted shunted PBRIAs. Secondly, the shunted PBRIAs are tested on an experimental test bed comprising a rotating shaft mounted in a frame. The noise is radiated by a plate that is attached to the frame. The experimental results show that a reduction of 11 dB on the disturbance force transmitted from the rotating shaft through the bearing to the housing can be achieved. This also generates a reduction of 9 dB for the plate vibration and the radiated noise. status: publishe...|$|E

The fixation between cement and Y-TZP surfaces can be improved by artificial microstructures, added to the inner surface of laser-processed dental crowns in a final step during ultrafast-laser-based manufacturing.

40|$|The state-of-art {{technical}} devices - {{from the}} aircraft and missile equipment to mobile machines in sphere of construction and agriculture -widely use hydraulic drives based on adjustable axial-piston hydraulic machines. During operation of such hydraulic drives, pressure fluctuations and power fluid flow rate occur, and {{it results in}} vibrations of hydraulic <b>machine</b> <b>housing</b> and its components and acoustic radiation of units. Such processes arise from the wave transients that may appear when a mode of operation is changed, or are available when the hydraulic machine separate units are in operation. Origination specificities of these processes and their development are not well studied. So implementation of such hydraulic machines in hydraulic drives of equipment {{with a wide variety}} of dynamic loads requires additional experimental and theoretical investigations. The objectives of this paper is to develop a hydraulic drive model based on adjustable axial-piston hydraulic machines and to investigate transients that are available in the operational cycle of a hydraulic drive. To study transients a method of mathematical modeling was used. For hydraulic drive mechanism with rotational displacement, a model with lumped parameters was developed. The model takes into consideration the kinematic and physical features of hydraulic drive components structure, peripheral devices and physical and mechanical properties of power fluid, thereby partially solving the task of investigating transients. There is no possibility to describe all aspects of transients within the framework of a mathematical model with lumped parameters. Difficulties spring up when modeling the wave processes that occur at transient of pumping unit hydraulic cylinders between the suction and discharge zones. For modeling the power fluid transient from pumping unit into discharge line, was developed a two-dimensional turbulent model with distributed parameters. An equation of state for two-phase power fluid in baratropic approximation was obtained. Based on the computational experiment results, it is found that unloading pressure fluctuations, which occur at transients in a pumping unit, considerably change the power fluid pressure distribution along a discharge line, and must be taken into consideration when modeling the dynamic processes in hydraulic drives based on adjustable axial-piston hydraulic machines. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{washing machine}} {{is a well}} known home {{appliance}} which is used at least weekly, in some cases daily, by almost every family. The importance of the task the machine performs combined with the variety of available machines has made competition between manufacturers harder and harder. Among the strongest drive forces {{in the field of}} washing machine development are the capacity increase together with reduction of energy consumption. Since the first machines with spin-drying ability the washing machine has had a reputation of being noisy and causing vibrations. A soft suspension improves the vibration isolation and reduces the vibration output, but the severity of the vibration problem can be increased with the bigger tub volume that a machine with higher capacity demands. As the same outer standard dimensions of the <b>machine</b> <b>housing</b> must be preserved, a stiffer suspension might be needed to keep the tub from hitting the housing at when passing the critical spin speed. Hence there are conflicting criterias to be dealt with. This paper focuses on several aspects of vibration dynamics in washing machines: the capacity maximization through the study of tub movement, the vibration output from the machine to the surroundings, and the “walking” tendency of the system. A computational model of a washing machine with bottom mount suspension has been built in Adams/View from MSC. Software, based on production drawings. Experimental data was used for validation of mathematical and computational models of functional components of the system {{as well as for the}} model of the complete washing machine. The models of the functional components have been parameterized and are used for suspension optimization in a computer cluster. Three objective functions related to kinematics and dynamics of washing machines have been defined and a numerical algorithm has been created to solve Pareto optimization problems. The algorithm is a genetic algorithm built around Matlab’s subroutine “gamultiobj. m” and executed on an in-house developed computer cluster with possibility of parallel computing of Adams/View models. The results are presented as optimized parameter values of suspension functional components, in this case bushings with respective Pareto fronts. The focus has been set on delivering couplings between parameter values and performance trade-offs in terms of objective functions to facilitate parameter tuning. The obtained optimization results have successively been used in the development of a novel washing machine which will go into production after the summer 2010...|$|E
40|$|Permanent magnet {{generators}} (PMG) {{represent the}} cutting edge technology in modern wind mills. The efficiency remains high (over 90 %) at partial loads. To improve the machine efficiency even further, every aspect of machine losses has to be analyzed. Additional losses are often given as a certain percentage without providing any detailed information about the actual calculation process; meanwhile, there are many design-dependent losses that {{have an effect on}} the total amount of additional losses and that have to be taken into consideration. Additional losses are most often eddy current losses in different parts of the machine. These losses are usually difficult to calculate in the design process. In this doctoral thesis, some additional losses are identified and modeled. Further, suggestions on how to minimize the losses are given. Iron losses can differ significantly between the measured no-load values and the loss values under load. In addition, with embedded magnet rotors, the quadrature-axis armature reaction adds losses to the stator iron by manipulating the harmonic content of the flux. It was, therefore, re-evaluated that in salient pole machines, to minimize the losses and the loss difference between the no-load and load operation, the flux density has to be kept below 1. 5 T in the stator yoke, which is the traditional guideline for machine designers. Eddy current losses may occur in the end-winding area and in the support structure of the machine, that is, in the finger plate and the clamping ring. With construction steel, these losses account for 0. 08 % of the input power of the machine. These losses can be reduced almost to zero by using nonmagnetic stainless steel. In addition, the <b>machine</b> <b>housing</b> may be subjected to eddy current losses if the flux density exceeds 1. 5 T in the stator yoke. Winding losses can rise rapidly when high frequencies and 10 – 15 mm high conductors are used. In general, minimizing the winding losses is simple. For example, it can be done by dividing the conductor into transposed subconductors. However, this comes with the expense of an increase in the DC resistance. In the doctoral thesis, a new method is presented to minimize the winding losses by applying a litz wire with noninsulated strands. The construction is the same as in a normal litz wire but the insulation between the subconductors has been left out. The idea is that the connection is kept weak to prevent harmful eddy currents from flowing. Moreover, the analytical solution for calculating the AC resistance factor of the litz-wire is supplemented by including an end-winding resistance in the analytical solution. A simple measurement device is developed to measure the AC resistance in the windings. In the case of a litz-wire with originally noninsulated strands, vacuum pressure impregnation (VPI) is used to insulate the subconductors. In one of the two cases studied, the VPI affected the AC resistance factor, but in the other case, it did not have any effect. However, more research is needed to determine the effect of the VPI on litz-wire with noninsulated strands. An empirical model is developed to calculate the AC resistance factor of a single-layer formwound winding. The model includes the end-winding length and the number of strands and turns. The end winding includes the circulating current (eddy currents that are traveling through the whole winding between parallel strands) and the main current. The end-winding length also affects the total AC resistance factor...|$|E
