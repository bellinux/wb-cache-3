[...] Of the storyline where she returned to Jabot Cosmetics, Cooper stated: [...] "Since I {{went back into the}} business of business, I've been taking away some of Jill's power. You wanna go broke? Leave your company in the hands of Jill! The other day, we were filming some confrontational scenes, and Jess [...] says, 'Doesn't it feel good?' And the crew is like: 'Good! The girls are at it again!'" [...] Lilana Novakovich of The Record noted that the rivalry between the two women has [...] "outlived most marriages". Cooper stated: [...] "The audience – both young and old – relate to the Kay/Jill relationship". Walton describes their relationship as [...] "incredible" [...] and said: [...] "The love and the hate is so mixed, and there is never any telling when it will bubble out now.

His timing was perfect, for as Lunney later said, [...] "there {{was no such thing}} as space flight until the <b>month</b> <b>I</b> got out of college". Lunney was soon transferred to Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, where in September 1959 he became a member of the Space Task Group, which was the body given responsibility for the creation of NASA's manned space program. Aged twenty-one, he was the youngest of the forty-five members of the group. His first assignment was with the Control Center Simulation Group, which planned the simulations used to train both flight controllers and astronauts for the as-yet unknown experience of manned spaceflight.|$|E

I am trusting my instinct and it is telling me now is the appropriate time to stop (playing).

500|$|Roshan then {{collaborated with}} {{director}} Sanjay Leela Bhansali on the drama Guzaarish (2010) {{in which he}} had the role of Ethan Mascarenhas, a former magician suffering from quadriplegia, who after years of struggle, files an appeal for euthanasia. Roshan had reservations about the role but agreed to the project after reading the film's story. To understand his role better, he interacted with paraplegic patients. In his own words, [...] "I used to spend six hours with the patients, initially once a week and then once a <b>month.</b> <b>I</b> used to go to understand what they go through, what they think, what their needs are. They have taught me a lot of things." [...] He also trained with a Ukrainian magician to perform the film's magic stunts, and put on weight to look the part. The film failed at the box office, though it and Roshan's performance were positively received by critics. A writer for Zee News praised the chemistry between Roshan and Rai, adding that they [...] "break the Bollywood mould of stereotypes". Roshan received the Zee Cine Award for Best Actor (Critics) and nominations for Filmfare, IIFA and Zee Cine Award for Best Actor.|$|E

2500|$|Russian historians {{claim that}} the Ingush volunteered {{to become a part}} of Russia. This {{conclusion}} is based mostly on the document signed on 13 June 1810 by General-Major Delpotso and representatives of 2 Ingush clans. Other clans resisted the Russian conquest. On June29, 1832 Russian barron Rozen reported in letter No.42 to count Chernishev that [...] "on the 23rd of this <b>month</b> <b>I</b> exterminated eight Ghalghai (Ingush) villages.

The Russian conquest was extremely difficult and the Russian forces began to rely on the method of colonization: extermination of local population and populating area with Cossack and Ossetian loyalists.|$|E

Providence provided the well through the merit of Miriam, the pillar of cloud through the merit of Aaron, and the manna through the merit of Moses. When Miriam died, the well ceased, but it came back through the merit of Moses and Aaron. When Aaron died, the pillar of cloud ceased, but both of them came back through the merit of Moses.

2500|$|According to Washburn, he and Cimino {{spent three}} days {{together}} in Los Angeles at the Sunset Marquis, hammering out the plot.

[...] "I had a month, that was it," [...] he explains. [...] "The clock was ticking. Write the fucking script! But all I {{had to do was}} watch TV.

[...] When Washburn was finished, he says, Cimino and Joann Carelli, an associate producer on The Deer Hunter who went on to produce two more of Cimino's later films, took him to dinner at a cheap restaurant off the Sunset Strip. He recalls, [...] "We finished, and Joann looks at me across the table, and she says, 'Well, Deric, it's fuck-off time.' I was fired. It was a classic case: you get a dummy, get him to write the goddamn thing, tell him to go fuck himself, put your name on the thing, and he'll go away. I was so tired, I didn't care.

They are there to wage war for profit. Screw them." [...] In a blog post the next day, Moulitsas defended and clarified his remarks:"My language was harsh, and, in reality, not true. Fact is, I did feel something. That's why I was so angry. I was angry that five soldiers—the real heroes in my mind—were killed the same day and got far lower billing in the newscasts.
