Using electron microprobe analysis, X-ray powder diffraction and single-crystal X-ray diffraction with crystal structure determination where possible, it was found that natrobetpakdalite, mendozavilite and melkovite are isostructural with betpakdalite and that obradovicite has a closely related structure.

40|$|Abstract This {{thesis is}} {{a summary of}} five papers, {{containing}} equilibrium and structure studies of aqueous molybdate and peroxomolybdate species. Some of the peroxomolybdate species have also been studied {{in terms of their}} dynamic and catalytic properties. The primary objective was to characterize species with potential catalytic activity, with emphasis on thebleach process of kraft pulp. For this, potentiometry, EXAFS and 17 O, 31 P, 1 H and 95 Mo NMR have been used. The molybdate speciation in 0. 300 M Na 2 (SO 4) medium was found to differ from that in 0. 600 M Na(Cl) medium, in that the uncharged monomeric molybdate species H 2 MoO 4 was stronger in the sulphate medium, while highly charged species, such as Mo 7 O 24 6 -, became somewhat less pronounced. Diperoxomolybdate species, (MoX 2) n (X = peroxo ligand, n = 1 - 2), dominated the peroxomolybdate systems when sufficient peroxide was available. Both sulphate and chloride coordinated to molybdenum in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and these species were more inert than diperoxomolybdate species without coordinated medium anions. Chemical exchange rates increased upon protonation. A dimeric triperoxomolydate species was the only species found that contained more than two peroxo groups per molybdenum atom. At low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, monoperoxoheptamolybdate species, Mo 7 X, were found. Phosphate was found to coordinate relatively weakly to molybdate in the presence of peroxide. Species with four different nuclearities, i. e. (MoX 2) nP (n = 1 - 4), were found. At excess of peroxide, no <b>molybdophosphates</b> were present. Chemical exchange rates were found to be substantially lower than in the peroxomolybdate system. The aqueous monomeric diperoxomolybdate species retain the pentagonal bipyramidal seven-coordination found in the solid state, although with increased bond lengths. Sulphate seems to coordinate to molybdenum in a monodentate fashion by replacing an oxygen atom. Chloride probably coordinates by replacing an oxygen atom as well. For the dimeric diperoxomolybdate species, a single oxygen-bridge was proposed. Conjugated carbon double bonds in the side chains of lignin model compounds were found to be hydroxylated or epoxidised by peroxomolybdate species. The addition of phosphate did not affect the type or yield of oxidation products noticeably. It was also shown that hydrogen peroxide, in the absence of molybdate, did not react to any noticeable extent with the lignin model compounds under these conditions...|$|R
40|$|Poly(o-anisidine) <b>molybdophosphate</b> was expediently {{obtained}} by sol-gel mixing of Poly(o-anisidine) into the inorganic matrices of <b>molybdophosphate,</b> which {{was allowed to}} react with silver nitrate {{to the formation of}} poly(o-anisidine) <b>molybdophosphate</b> embedded silver nano composite. The composite was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, UV-Vis Spectrophotometry, Fluorescence Spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy-dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy and Thermogravimertic Analysis. Ion exchange capacity and distribution studies were carried out to understand the ion-exchange capabilities of the nano composite. On the basis of highest distribution studies, this nano composite cation exchanger was used as preparation of heavy metal ion selective membrane.

Polyacrylamide was prepared by mixing equal volume of acrylamide and potassium persulfate. A viscous solution {{was obtained by}} heating the mixture gently at 70  °C with continuous stirring. Inorganic precipitate of Sn(IV) <b>molybdophosphate</b> was prepared at 25  °C by mixing equal volumes of the solutions of stannic chloride (0.1  M), ammonium molybdate (0.1  M) and orthophosphoric acid (1  M). The yellow precipitate was obtained when the pH of the mixture was adjusted to 1.05 by adding aqueous ammonia (NH 4 OH). The viscous solution of polyacrylamide {{was added to the}} yellow inorganic precipitate of Sn(IV) <b>molybdophosphate</b> and mixed thoroughly with continuous stirring. The resultant yellow colored slurry was refluxed for 3  h at a temperature of 70  ±  5  °C and the color of the slurry changed from yellow to greenish color. The resultant greenish colored slurry was kept for 24  h at room temperature for digestion. The supernatant liquid was decanted and gel was filtered using a centrifuge (about 104 rpm) and dried at 50  ±  1  °C. The product was crashed to obtain small granules and converted to H+-form by treating with 1  M HNO 3 for 24  h with occasional shaking intermittently replacing the supernatant liquid with fresh acid and the color of the product became yellow. The excess acid was removed after several washing with DMW, dried at 50  °C and sieved to obtain particles of particular size range (0.115 – 0.375  mm). The percentage of yield and physical appearance of beads were selected for further studies.|$|E
40|$|High Level Waste samples contain {{elevated}} {{concentrations of}} radioactive cesium requiring marked dilution {{of the waste}} to facilitate handling in non-shielded facilities. The authors developed a sample treatment protocol, using ammonium <b>molybdophosphate</b> (AMP) to remove sufficient cesium to allow handling of the samples with minimal dilution. The sample treatment protocol includes the following steps: pH adjust the sample to the range of 0. 01 to 1. 0 M acidity; mix 30 mL of acidified sample with 40 - 60 mg of AMP; cap and shake the mixture for 30 - 60 seconds; filter AMP from the liquid using 0. 45 PTFE syringe filters; and send filtrate directly forward for analysis. To develop the method, SRTC performed {{a series of tests}} with three different salt solutions designed to determine the propensity of ammonium <b>molybdophosphate</b> (AMP) to bind some of the common analytes such as the actinides (Pu, Am, Np, U), strontium, or the metals (Ag, As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Se) regulated by the Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA).

30|$|Sorption {{behavior}} of some lanthanide ions such as lanthanum and samarium ions on polyacrylamide stannic <b>molybdophosphate</b> {PASnMoP} as organic–inorganic composite has been investigated. The distribution coefficients of La 3 + and Sm 3 + ions in different pH media on PASnMoP were determined with the selectivity order La 3 + > Sm 3 +. Capacity of PASnMoP for La 3 + and Sm 3 + ions was determined and found 24.66 and 15.38  mg g− 1 for La 3 + and Sm 3 + ions, respectively. The resin dosage dependence for the sorption behavior for La 3 + and Sm 3 + ions on polyacrylamide stannic <b>molybdophosphate</b> was conducted. The adsorption isotherms were described {{by means of}} Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms for La 3 + and Sm 3 + ions. The Langmuir model represented the adsorption process better than the Freundlich model. The kinetic data were tested using Logergren-first-order and Pseudo-second-order kinetic models. The data correlated well with the Pseudo-second-order kinetic model, indicating that the chemical adsorption was the rate limiting step. Thermodynamic parameters ΔG°, ΔH° and ΔS° were also calculated and the data showed that the ion exchange of La 3 + and Sm 3 + ions on PASnMoP was spontaneous and endothermic in nature.|$|E

40|$|The {{analytical}} method for {{the determination of}} phosphorus in ultrapurified water was developed. Ultrapurified water was evaporated to concentrate phosphorus and the final sample volume for analysis was 10 ml. In 0. 55 mol 1 (- 1) HCl, orthophosphate forms <b>molybdophosphate,</b> and then the <b>molybdophosphate</b> forms ion associate with Malachite Green (MG), which can be collected on a tiny membrane filter (diameter: 5 mm, and effective filtering diameter: 2 mm). After the ion associate on the membrane filter is dissolved together with the membrane filter in I ml of methyl cellosolve (MC), the absorbance of MC solution is measured at 627 nm by a flow injection-spectrophotometric detection technique. When 10 ml of the sample solution {{was used for the}} procedures and absorbance measurement, the calibration graph is linear up to about 500 ng 1 (- 1) of phosphorus and the detection limit was 8 ng 1 (- 1) (S/N = 3). For the determination of phosphorus in an ultrapurified water, 10 - 40 ml of sample solutions were transferred into poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) beaker and evaporated to 5 ml or to dryness. To them, 0. 003 mol 1 (- 1) HCl was added to get 10 ml of final solution, which was used as sample. Phosphate is determined by comparing the slope of the varied sample volume after evaporation/concentration with a slope of the standard calibration graph (a slope comparison method: SCM).

40|$|International audienceAmmonium <b>molybdophosphate</b> and Phozir (alone or in combination) {{have been}} {{encapsulated}} in alginate beads for {{the synthesis of}} rubidium sorbents. SEM and SEM-EDX analyses confirm the homogeneity of the sorbents in terms of composition and metal binding. AMP sorbent is less sensitive to pH than Phozir, and optimum pH is close to pH 3 for the binding of Rb(I). The Langmuir equation fitted well sorption isotherms and the maximum sorption capacities were in the range 0. 65 - 0. 74 mmol Rb g− 1. The resistance to intraparticle diffusion contributes to control uptake kinetics (effect of particle size) though the presence of solid inorganic particles reduces the impact of drying alginate capsules (preventing {{the collapse of the}} porous structure during the drying step).

Ammonium <b>molybdophosphate</b> (AMP) immobilized on a polyacrylonitrile support (AMP-PAN) has been studied as an ion exchange agent for cesium removal from acidic waste solutions. Capacities, distribution coefficients, elutability, and kinetics of cesium-extraction have been evaluated.

The measured cesium distribution coefficients from actual waste solutions were 3287 mL/g for dissolved zirconia calcines, and 2679 mL/g for sodium-bearing waste. The cesium in the dissolved alumina calcines was analyzed for; however, the concentration was below analytical detectable limits resulting in inconclusive results.

Such reactivity was not underlined {{in the case of the}} W-series. All the samples were characterized from a thermal and mechanical point of view as a function of the RO 3 (R = Mo, W) for SnO substitution. Two types of behaviors were identified. For the Mo-series, all the characteristics, except density, present an extremum value for the chemical composition with a 1 : 1 SnO-MoO 3 molar ratio. This is strongly correlated to the amount of NZP crystals present in the glass ceramic, the different behavior observed for the density being due to the low compactness of the NZP phase. For the W-series, all these different characteristics varies monotonously according to a progressive strengthening of the network by replacement of a low field strength ion (Sn 2 +) by a higher field strength ion (W 6 +).

First, the optimal conditions to form the <b>molybdophosphate</b> complex in artificial seawater medium were determined by addition of sulphuric acid and sodium molybdate to the solution containing orthophosphate. Secondly, the anodic oxidation of molybdenum to form molybdate ions and protons was used to create the <b>molybdophosphate</b> complex without addition of any liquid reagents. The <b>molybdophosphate</b> complex is detectable by amperometry with an average precision of 2. 2 % for the concentration range found in the open ocean and the detection limit is 0. 12 mu M. Three solutions are proposed to address the silicate interferences issue and one of these methods is used for the natural samples collected in the coastal waters offshore Peru during the Pelagico 1011 - 12 -BIC OLAYA cruise in November-December 2010. Results showed a good precision with an average of 2. 5 % and a reasonable deviation of the amperometric analysis as compared with colorimetric measurements (4. 9 %). (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} reduce the road asphalt fumes in the process of construction, the paper {{proposed}} to add some substances in asphalt to reduce the yield of asphalt fumes. Firstly, considering the theory of how the asphalt fumes come into being in the process of construction on the pavement, six possible additives to restrain these fumes havd been screened out. And tests of fumes suppression effect had been done to get the results that: SBS has a good effect of fumes suppression. When added by 3 %, the asphalt fumes reduced by the rate of 19. 2 %; PE has an suppressive effect on asphalt fumes. When added by 3 %, the asphalt fumes reduced by the rate of 6. 5 %; Melamine has a good effect of fumes suppression. When added by 3 %, the asphalt fumes reduced by the rate of 45. 1 %; Ammonium <b>molybdophosphate</b> has an abnormal effect of fumes suppression. When added by 1 %, the asphalt fumes not only did not reduce but increases. When added by 3 %, the asphalt fumes reduced by the rate of 23. 3 %; Nano Calcium carbonate has an effect of fumes suppression. When added by 3 %, the asphalt fumes reduced by the rate of 4. 8 %; Activated Carbon has a good effect of fumes suppression. When added by 3 %, the asphalt fumes reduced by the rate of 41. 6 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) samplers for {{the measurement of}} cesium radionuclides in solution, using an ammonium <b>molybdophosphate</b> (AMP) binding agent, was tested under both laboratory and field conditions. In the former they proved able to reproduce known 134 Cs concentrations (60 Bq L- 1) {{with a high degree}} of accuracy and precision over periods up to 1 d, in freshwaters over a wide range of pH and temperature, and in saline water. In field trials in a freshwater lake receiving nuclear power station discharges, mean concentrations of 137 Cs (47 − 61 mBq L- 1) were measured over periods from 5 d to 1 month. These agreed, within error, with mean concentrations determined from grab samples but rigorous field validation of long-term (month) deployments of DGT devices proved impossible using conventional sampling procedures, due to loss of 137 Cs to container walls. Identified limitations of the DGT technique included probable AMP degradation over longer periods and calibration problems if large changes in temperature and concentration occurred together. Potential limitations due to biofilm growth were considered not to be significant. Despite the limitations, the technique appears to measure concentrations accurately for deployment times of 1 month or less. It has several advantages over traditional sampling methods for monitoring radionuclides in the solution/dissolved phase, including its simplicity, provision of time-averaged mean concentrations, and automatic in-situ concentration onto a medium with ideal counting geometry for gamma spectrometry...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{reaction}} between molybdophosphoric acid and lecithin. The resulting complex was isolated and shown to contain <b>molybdophosphate</b> and lecithin in the molar ratio 1 / 3. It is {{insoluble in water}} but soluble in chloroform, and the reaction is specific for molecules containing electrophilic nitrogen, indicating good specificity in biological fluids for nitrogen-containing phospholipids. In solution the complex may be reduced, yielding molyb-denum blue. We applied {{the reaction to the}} measurement of phospholipid concentrations in amniotic fluid. As compared with procedures involving either digestion or the determination of the lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio, the present technique is faster and its analytical precision exceeds that of the lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio determi-nation. Although results by the three methods do not cor-relate well, the predictive value of the present method appears to be comparable with the other two.

40|$|The general {{objectives}} of this task are to develop, prepare, and test spheroidal inorganic ion exchangers {{made by the}} HMTA (hexamethylenetetramine) internal gelation process to remove radionuclides and heavy metals from waste streams occurring at the various DOE sites. Inorganic ion-exchange materials, such as sodium silicotitanate, sodium titanate, ammonium molybdeophosphate, phosphotungstic acid, hexacyanoferrates, titanium monohydrogen phosphate, hydrous titanium oxide, polyantimonic acid, magnesium oxide, etc. have high selectivities and efficiencies for separating and removing radionuclides (e. g., cesium, strontium, technetium, iodine, europium, cerium, ruthenium, and zirconium), actinides, and other elements (such as lead, mercury, silver, nickel, zinc, chromium, and fluoride) from aqueous waste streams. The development of cesium specific spherical sorbents for treatment of acidic, high-salt waste solutions was initiated in FY 1998. Acid-side treatment is important at INEEL and could become important if acidic sludge washing were to become a treatment option at Hanford, Savannah River, or Oak Ridge. Zirconium monohydrogen phosphates (ZrHP) embedded with ammonium <b>molybdophosphate</b> (AMP) was the cesium selective inorganic sorbent chosen for making microspheres. AMP {{is known to be}} a very effective sorbent for removing cesium from waste streams over a wide range of acidity and salinity, and it has very rapid loading kinetics. The cesium can also be eluted from AMP with ammonium salt solutions. AMP cannot be used as a sorbent at pHs above 7 because it decomposes. In the pH range of 1 to 7, ZrHP is also a very effective sorbent for removing Cs, Sr, Th, U(VI), Pu(IV), AM(III), Hg, and Pb from streams of lower ionic concentrations...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} and radiation stability of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) {{in the form}} of beads (B-PAN), similar to the beads of composite absorbers, and one selected composite absorber (ammonium <b>molybdophosphate,</b> the active component in PAN binder [AMP-PAN], a prospective candidate for the treatment of acidic wastes) were studied. Aqueous 1 M HNO{sub 3 } + 1 M NaNO{sub 3 }, 1 M NaOH + 1 M NaNO{sub 3 }, and 1 M NaOH were chosen as simulants of DOE acidic and alkaline wastes. In addition,radiation stability was determined indistilled water. The chemical stability of B-PAN and AMP-PAN beads was tested for a period up to one month of contact with the solution at ambient temperature. The radiation stability of the beads was checked in a radiation dose range 10 {sup 3 } [...] 10 {sup 6 } Gy (10 {sup 5 } [...] 10 {sup 8 } rads). In acidic solutions the stability of PAN binder was proved not to be limited by either chemical or radiation decomposition. PAN binder may thus be used for preparing composite absorbers for treatment of acid wastes from DOE facilities. The same conclusion is valid for alkaline solutions with pH up to 13. In highly alkaline solutions (concentration of NAOH higher than I M) and in the presence of NaNO{sub 3 }, the stability of the tested polyacrylonitrile polymer was sufficient for applications not extending over 10 days. Cross-linking of the polymer caused by ionizing radiation was found to have a positive influence on chemical stability. This effect enables a longer period of applicability of PAN-based composite absorbers. Because of the high sorption rate achievable with PAN-based absorbers, the stability achieved is sufficient for most applications in the DOE complex. The chemical stability of binding polymer may also be further improved by testing another, more suitable type of polymer from the broad family of polyacrylonitrile polymers...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of PAN-based composite absorbers was evaluated in dynamic experiments at flow rates ranging from 25 [...] 100 bed volumes (BV) per hour. Composite absorbers with active components of ammonium <b>molybdophosphate</b> (AMP) PAN and K-Co ferrocyanide (KCoFC) PAN {{were used for}} separating Cs from a 1 M HNO{sub 3 } + 1 M NaNO{sub 3 } + 2 {times} 10 {sup {minus} 5 } M CsCl acidic simulant solution. KCoFC-PAN and two other FC-based composite absorbers were tested for separating Cs from alkaline simulant solutions containing 0. 01 M to 1 M NaOH and 1 M NaNO{sub 3 } + x {times} 10 {sup {minus} 4 } M CsCl. The efficiency of the Cs sorption on the AMP-PAN absorber from acidic simulant solutions was negatively influenced by {{the dissolution of the}} AMP active component. At flow rates of 50 BV/hr, the decontamination factor of about 10 {sup 3 } could be maintained for treatment of 380 BV of the feed. With the KCoFC-PAN absorber, the decontamination factor of about 10 {sup 3 } could be maintained for a feed volume as great as 1, 800 BV. In alkaline simulant solutions, significant decomposition of the active components was observed, and the best performance was exhibited by the KCoFC-PAN absorber. Introductory experiments confirmed that Cs may be washed out of the composite absorbers. Regeneration of both absorbers for repetitive use was also found to be possible. The main result of the study is that PAN was proven to be a versatile polymer capable of forming porous composite absorbers with a large number of primary absorbers. The composite absorbers proved to be capable of withstanding the harsh acidic and alkaline conditions and significant radiation doses that may be expected in the treatment of US DOE wastes.

40|$|A {{spheroidal}} composite inorganic sorbent {{was developed}} for U. S. Department of Energy-Efficient Separations and Processing Crosscutting Program (USDOE-ESP) for potential use in removing radioactive cesium isotopes from acidic high-salt waste streams such as those at Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). The sorbent, zirconium monohydrogen phosphate (ZrHP) embedded with fine powder of ammonium <b>molybdophosphate</b> (AMP), was prepared using a unique internal gelation process {{which can be used}} to make porous reproducible microspheres that are structurally strong, have a low tendency for surface erosion, and improve the flow dynamics for column operations. Both ZrHP and AMP are excellent sorbent materials and, being inorganic, are stable in high radiation fields. AMP is a very effective sorbent for removing cesium from salt-bearing waste streams for a wide range of acidity. In the pH range of 2 to 10, ZrHP is also a very effective sorbent for removing Cs, Sr, Th, U(VI), Pu(IV), Am(III), Hg, and Pb from streams of lower ionic concentrations. Crucial to developing the spheroidal AMP-ZrHP sorbent was to determine the ideal weight percentage of AMP that could be embedded in the ZrHP microspheres in order to maintain the structural integrity of the microspheres and also achieve a good cesium separation. A total of 12 preparations were made. The dry weight percentage of AMP ranged from 30 to 60. Overall, the best composite microspheres prepared contained 50 % AMP (by dry weight measurement). Another composite microsphere, which was composed of titanium monohydrogen phosphate (TiHP) embedded with 18 wt % (air-dried weight) potassium cobalt hexacyanoferrate (KCoCF) and developed for a different separations application, was also batch tested for comparison. It proved to be as effective in removing,the cesium as the air-dried AMP (50 wt %) -ZrHP. Granular KCoCF was also prepared and was very effective. Large samples of each of these materials were sent to INEEL for small-column testing with real waste...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} presents work {{conducted in}} support of technical needs expressed, in part, by the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Contractor for the Salt Waste Processing Facility (SWPF). The Department of Energy (DOE) requested that Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) analyze and characterize supernate waste from seven selected High Level Waste (HLW) tanks to allow classification of feed {{to be sent to}} the SWPF, verification that SWPF processes will be able to meet Saltstone Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC), and updating of the Waste Characterization System (WCS) database. This document provides characterization data of samples obtained from Tanks 13 H, 30 H, 37 H, 39 H, 45 F, 46 F, and 49 H and discusses results. Characterization of the waste tank samples involved several treatments and analysis at various stages of sample processing. These analytical stages included as-received liquid, post-dilution to 6. 44 M sodium (target), post-acid digestion, post-filtration (at 3 filtration pore sizes), and after cesium removal using ammonium <b>molybdophosphate</b> (AMP). Results and observations obtained from testing include the following. All tanks will require cesium removal as well as treatment with Monosodium Titanate (MST) for 90 Sr (Strontium) decontamination. A small filtration effect for 90 Sr was observed for five of the seven tank wastes. No filtration effects were observed for Pu (Plutonium), Np (Neptunium), U (Uranium), or Tc (Technetium). 137 Cs (Cesium) concentration is approximately E+ 09 pCi/mL for all the tank wastes. Tank 37 H is significantly higher in 90 Sr than the other six tanks. 237 Np in the F-Area tanks(45 F and 46 F) are at least 1 order of magnitude less than the H-Area tank wastes. The data indicate a constant ratio of 99 Tc to Cs in the seven tank wastes. This indicates the Tc remains largely soluble in Savannah River Site (SRS) waste and partition similarly with Cs. 241 Am (Americium) concentration was low in the seven tank wastes. The majority of data were detection limit values, the largest being less than 1. 0 E+ 04 pCi/mL. Measured values for Pu and U were generally well below solubility model predictions...|$|E
