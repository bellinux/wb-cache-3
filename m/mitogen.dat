The simultaneous stimulation of lymphocytes with two non-specific <b>mitogens</b> resulted in antagonistic or synergistic effects. Antagonism was found when two <b>mitogens</b> were added in optimal concentrations, whereas synergism occurred when both were present in suboptimal concentrations. Non-specific <b>mitogens</b> in high concentrations abolished induction of DNA synthesis by specific antigens, whereas they increased the response to antigen when they were added in low, by themselves non-stimulating, concentrations.

5000|$|<b>Mitogens</b> act {{primarily}} by influencing {{a set of}} proteins which {{are involved in the}} restriction of progression through the cell cycle. The G1 checkpoint is controlled most directly by mitogens: further cell cycle progression does not need <b>mitogens</b> to continue. The point where <b>mitogens</b> are no longer needed to move the cell cycle forward is called the [...] "restriction point" [...] and depends on cyclins to be passed. One of {{the most important of these}} is TP53, a gene which produces a family of proteins known as p53. P53, combined with the Ras pathway, downregulate cyclin D1, a cyclin-dependent kinase if they are not stimulated by the presence of <b>mitogens.</b> In the presence of <b>mitogens,</b> sufficient cyclin D1 can be produced. This process cascades onwards, producing other cyclins which stimulate the cell sufficiently to allow reproduction. While animals produce internal signals that can drive the cell cycle forward, external <b>mitogens</b> can cause it to progress without these signals.|$|R

FGF-1 stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of all cell types necessary for building an arterial vessel, including endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells; this fact distinguishes FGF-1 from other pro-angiogenic growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which primarily drives the formation of new capillaries.|$|E
2500|$|Growth hormone (GH), {{also known}} as {{somatotropin}} (or as human growth hormone [...] in its human form), is a peptide hormone that stimulates growth, cell reproduction, and cell regeneration in humans and other animals.

2500|$|A special {{extension}} to the C-terminal kinase domain core, the so-called [...] "Domain for Versatile Docking" [...] (DVD) is a region found in MKK7 {{as in most}} known MAP2Ks,. The DVD region is a stable, mostly helical fold of roughly 20 amino acids, that adds onto {{the back side of}} the catalytic core of the MAP2K kinase domains. This domain extension is both required for the specific binding to, and activation of MKK7 by respective upstream MAPKKKs. Other <b>mitogen</b> activated protein kinase kinases also require the DVD region (in addition to various other non-canonical elements of their kinase domains, like the [...] "MKK1/2-loop") to be able to discriminate against the various MAPKKK upstream. These special MAPKK:MAPKKK kinase-domain/kinase-domain interactions facilitate the phosphorylation of MKK7. [...] In addition to the activation of MKK7, binding to the DVD region may also affect the MKK7 activation loop in such a way that the Ser and Thr of the S-K-A-K-T motif become accessible for phosphorylation.|$|E

40|$|Soluble <b>mitogens</b> and adhesion-dependent {{organization}} of the actin cytoskeleton are required for cells to enter S phase in fibroblasts. The induction of cyclin A is also required for S-phase entry, and we now report that distinct effects of <b>mitogens</b> and the actin cytoskeleton on the phosphorylation of CREB and pocket proteins regulate the extent and timing of cyclin A promoter activity, respectively. First, we show that CREB phosphorylation and binding to the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) determines the extent, but not the timing, of cyclin A promoter activity. Second, we show that pocket protein inactivation regulates the timing, but not the extent, of cyclin A promoter activity. CREB phosphorylation and CRE occupancy are regulated by soluble <b>mitogens</b> alone, while the phosphorylation of pocket proteins requires both <b>mitogens</b> and the organized actin cytoskeleton. Mechanistically, cytoskeletal integrity controls pocket protein phosphorylation by allowing for sustained ERK signaling and, thereby, the expression of cyclin D 1. Our results lead to a model of cyclin A gene regulation in which <b>mitogens</b> play a permissive role by stimulating early G 1 -phase phosphorylation of CREB and a distinct regulatory role by cooperating with the organized actin cytoskeleton to regulate the duration of ERK signaling, the expression of cyclin D 1, and the timing of pocket protein phosphorylation...|$|R

2500|$|Autoimmunity {{can thus}} be defined simply as {{exceptions}} to the tolerance [...] "rules." [...] By doing this, an immune response is generated against self-tissue and cells. These mechanisms are known {{by many to be}} intrinsic. However, there are pathogenic mechanisms for the generation of autoimmune disease. Pathogens can induce autoimmunity by polyclonal activation of B or T cells, or increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or II molecules. There are several ways in which a pathogen can cause an autoimmune response. A pathogen may contain a protein that acts as a <b>mitogen</b> to encourage cell division, thus causing more B or T cell clones to be produced. Similarly, a pathogenic protein may act as a superantigen which causes rapid polyclonal activation of B or T cells. Pathogens can also cause the release of cytokines resulting in the activation of B or T cells, or they can alter macrophage function. Finally, pathogens may also expose B or T cells to cryptic determinants, which are self antigen determinants that have not been processed and presented sufficiently to tolerize the developing T cells in the thymus and are presented at the periphery where the infection occurs.|$|E

40|$|Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of gram-negative bacilli {{are known}} to protect mice against {{unrelated}} bacterial infections and to be nonspecific <b>mitogens</b> of murine bone marrow-derived (B-) lymphocytes. For assessment {{of the role of}} these cells in the mechanism of LPS-induced resistance to infection with Klebsiella, various non-toxic <b>mitogens</b> were assayed. In contrast to LPS or lipid A, the nontoxic <b>mitogens</b> did not protect mice. Experiments were also performed with LPS in nude mice and in mice treated with immunosuppressants. Stimulation by LPS was decreased after administration of hydrocortisone or cyclophosphamide under conditions that in-hibited the in vitro activation of lymphocytes by <b>mitogens.</b> Moreover, nude mice and mice treated with 6 -mercaptopurine were more resistant to Klebsiella than were control mice. Circulating antibodies can protect mice against organisms that have a polysaccharide capsule [1], for example, Klebsiella pneumoniae [2]. However, our previous studies have shown that endotoxins can also enhance natural resistance to this virulent strain by a nonspecific mechanism that delays bacterial proliferation and thus al-lows time for the establishment of the SPecific immune response [3 - 5).

The {{incidence}} of death from leprosy and the mean survival time of leprous mice were recorded. In addition, the blastogenic responses to the T-cell <b>mitogens</b> phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A and to the B-cell <b>mitogens</b> lipopolysaccharide and dextran sulfate were evaluated at various times {{during the course of}} infection in the spleen and peripheral lymph nodes of mice infected with 107 bacilli. When M. lepraemurium was administered i. p., the two strains of mice succumbed to the disease at about the same time, except for the C 57 BL/ 6 mice infected with 109 bacilli, which died earlier than the C 3 H/St mice. Moreover, in both strains of mice, a progressive depression of blastogenesis, first to the T-cell <b>mitogens</b> and then to the B-cell <b>mitogens</b> in the spleen, and to the T-cell <b>mitogens</b> in the peripheral lymph nodes, occurred {{during the course of the}} infection, whereas the response to the B-cell <b>mitogens</b> in the nodes increased slowly during the advanced stage of the disease. When 107 and 105 bacilli were injected into the footpad, the C 3 H/St mice succumbed to the disease at 298 and 344 days, respectively, and the modifications of blastogenesis were similar to those observed in i. p. -infected C 3 H/St mice. In contrast, the C 57 BL/ 6 mice appeared resistant to footpad inoculation of M. lepraemurium, since they lived until the end of the observation period (466 days postinfection) and the depression of blastogenesis was not detectable until 1 year after the infection. Thus, it is concluded that for the C 57 BL/ 6 mice (but not for the C 3 H/St mice), the route of administration of M. lepraemurium can markedly influence the susceptibility or resistance to leprosy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe cytoplasmic adaptor protein FADD is an {{essential}} component of the death-inducing signaling complexes (DISCs) that assemble when TNF receptor family members, such as Fas, are ligated. FADD inititates the proteolytic cascade that leads to apoptosis by binding to and promoting the autocatalytic activation of caspase- 8 [1 – 4]. Surprisingly, FADD (but not caspase- 8) is also required for T cells to proliferate upon their stimulation with <b>mitogens</b> [5 – 9]. Using transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative mutant of FADD (FADD-DN), we show that functional FADD is required for T cells to proliferate in response to antigens in vivo as well as to <b>mitogens</b> in culture. The costimulation of wild-type and FADD-DN T cells with <b>mitogens</b> revealed that FADD-DN T cells have a cell-autonomous defect in intracellular signaling. In contrast to another study [6], p 53 deficiency did not rescue mitogen-induced proliferation of FADD-DN T cells, and neither did enforced expression of the apoptosis inhibitor Bcl- 2. Like wild-type T cells, FADD-DN T cells stimulated with <b>mitogens</b> mobilized intracellular calcium and activated members of the NF-κB transcription factor family as well as p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and p 44 / 42 MAPK. Therefore, FADD must act downstream of or in parallel to these signaling pathways...|$|R

40|$|The {{requirements}} for growth factors of human melanocytes in culture may {{be dependent on}} the stage of malignant transformation. Several factors synergistically promote the viability and proliferation of human neonatal melanocytes in culture. They are TPA (12 -O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol- 13 - acetate), isobutylmethyl xanthine, cholera toxin, and as yet unidentified factors from extracts derived from several cell lines and human placenta. Neonatal melanocytes can maintain at least 50 population doublings during a period of 6 months, whereas melanocytes from adult skin proliferate only for 1 month and at less than 1 % of the proliferative rate of melanocytes derived from newborn foreskins. In contrast, melanocytes from dysplastic and congenital nevi proliferate well in the presence of <b>mitogens</b> during the initial 4 - 6 weeks of culture, but then become quiescent. Melanocytes from primary melanomas are the most difficult to grow in culture. They need the <b>mitogens,</b> but their rate of proliferation is slow. Most of the metastatic melanocyte strains that do not need the <b>mitogens</b> in order to proliferate, are strongly inhibited by TPA, {{and to a lesser extent}} by WI- 38 cell extract.
