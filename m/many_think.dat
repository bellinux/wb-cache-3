5|$|He {{is always}} there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course {{the only time we}} ever get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what <b>many</b> <b>think</b> of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E
25|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{identify}} the mythical Sarasvati of the Vedas with physical rivers. <b>Many</b> <b>think</b> that the Vedic Sarasvati river once flowed east of the Indus (Sindhu) river. Scientists, geologists as well as scholars have identified the Sarasvati with many present-day or now defunct rivers.|$|E

To find out, Firestar sends a patrol to WindClan, but Onestar denies the possibility. As the patrol leaves, Ashfoot tells ThunderClan that she sighted Sol near the sight of Ashfur's dead body, and this leads to the thought that Sol killed Ashfur.|$|E

Takahē were at one time present {{throughout}} this island country, but for several reasons ceased to be found, which made <b>many</b> <b>think</b> that they were wiped out. Many reasons were cited {{for the failure of}} this flightless bird. There are two significant periods when takahē numbers declined: pre-European and post-European arrival.|$|E
25|$|Though life is {{confirmed}} only on Earth, <b>many</b> <b>think</b> that extraterrestrial {{life is not}} only plausible, but probable or inevitable. Other planets and moons in the Solar System and other planetary systems are being examined for evidence of having once supported simple life, and projects such as SETI are trying to detect radio transmissions from possible alien civilizations. Other locations within the Solar System that may host microbial life include the subsurface of Mars, the upper atmosphere of Venus, and subsurface oceans {{on some of the}} moons of the giant planets.|$|E
25|$|To many visitors, {{the most}} {{striking}} element of the historic habitat at Chillingham is the widespread occurrence of large oak trees amongst grassland (wood pasture), providing a glimpse of Britain as <b>many</b> <b>think</b> it appeared in medieval times. However, most of these trees were only planted in the 1780s - early 19th century, and the truly ancient trees of the park are the streamside alder trees, which were probably coppiced in the mid-18th century. They were probably hundreds of years old even then and the stems now growing are themselves around 250 years old. A diversity {{of plants and animals}} find a habitat here, due to the absence of the intensive farming found in most other places in Britain.|$|E

Silesia is his; farther interest in the Controversy, except that it would end itself in some fair manner, he has none.

25|$|Vibrato {{can also}} be used for a fast trill. A trill {{initiated}} from just hammering the finger {{up and down on the}} fingerboard will create a harsher quality than with a vibrato trill. For example, if trilling on the first finger, the second finger is placed very slightly off the string and vibrato is implemented. The second finger will lightly touch the string above the first finger causing the pitch to change. This has a softer quality and <b>many</b> <b>think</b> it is nicer-sounding than a hammered trill. Note: this trill technique only works well for semi-tonal trills, it is far more difficult to vibrato trill for an interval of a tone or more.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{there have}} been {{numerous}} legislative actions and policies implemented on a federal and state level to both regulate atomic energy and promote its expansion. Growth of nuclear power in the US ended in the 1980s, however the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was passed in 2005 which aimed to jump start the nuclear industry through financial loan-guarantees for expansion and re-outfitting of nuclear plants. The success of this legislation is still undetermined, since all 17 companies that applied for funding are still in the planning phases on their 26 proposed building applications. Some of the proposed sites have even scrapped their building plans, and <b>many</b> <b>think</b> the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster further dampen the success of expansion of nuclear energy in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Chaka Khan {{was raised}} as a Catholic. She {{attributed}} {{her love of}} music to her grandmother, who introduced her to jazz as a child. Khan became a fan of rhythm and blues music as a pre-teen and at eleven formed a girl group, the Crystalettes, which included her sister Taka. In the late 1960s, Khan attended several civil rights rallies with her father's second wife, Connie, {{a strong supporter of}} the movement, and joined the Black Panther Party after befriending fellow member, activist, and Chicago native Fred Hampton in 1967. Though <b>many</b> <b>think</b> that she was given the name Chaka while in the Panthers she {{has made it clear that}} her name Chaka Adunne Aduffe Hodarhi Karifi was given to her at age 13 by a Yoruba Baba. In 1969, she left the Panthers and dropped out of high school, having attended Calumet High School and Kenwood High School (now Kenwood Academy). She began to perform in small groups around the Chicago area, first performing with Cash McCall's group Lyfe, which included her then boyfriend Hassan Khan.|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the songs}} on the album seem {{to be based on}} the {{pressures}} of fame and dealing with the resulting loss of privacy. These include [...] "Not for You", [...] "Pry, To", [...] "Corduroy", [...] "Bugs", [...] "Satan's Bed", and [...] "Immortality". Vedder said, [...] "I'm just totally vulnerable. I'm way too fucking soft for this whole business, this whole trip. I don't have any shell. There's a contradiction there, because that's probably why I can write songs that mean something to someone and express some of these things that other people can't necessarily express." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Not for You" [...] express anger at the bureaucracy of the music industry and [...] "how youth is being sold and exploited," [...] while Vedder said [...] "Corduroy" [...] is about [...] "one person's relationship with a million people." [...] In [...] "Pry, To" [...] the phrase [...] "P-r-i-v-a-c-y is priceless to me" [...] is repeated. <b>Many</b> <b>think</b> that the lyrics of [...] "Immortality" [...] may be about Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain's suicide, although Vedder has denied this, suggesting instead that it's about [...] "the pressures on someone who is on a parallel train." [...] The lyrics that appeared in the first live version of [...] "Immortality" [...] were altered before the song was released as part of the album. Vedder said regarding [...] "Nothingman" [...] that [...] "if you love someone and they love you, don't fuck up...'cause you are left with less than nothing." [...] "Better Man" [...] is a song about an abusive relationship. Vedder wrote [...] "Better Man" [...] when he was in high school and performed it with his previous band, Bad Radio. Considered a [...] "blatantly great pop song" [...] by producer Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and had initially rejected it from Vs. due to its accessibility.|$|E
