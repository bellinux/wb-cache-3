40|$|Multidimensional data is {{increasingly}} more prominent and important in many application domains. Such data typically {{consist of a}} large set of elements, each of which described by several measurements (dimensions). During the design of techniques and tools to process this data, a key component is to gather insights into their structure and patterns, which can be described by the notion of similarity between elements. Among these techniques, <b>multidimensional</b> <b>projections</b> and similarity trees can effectively capture similarity patterns and handle {{a large number of}} data elements and dimensions. However, understanding and interpreting these patterns in terms of the original data dimensions is still hard. This thesis addresses the development of visual explanatory techniques for the easy interpretation of similarity patterns present in <b>multidimensional</b> <b>projections</b> and similarity trees, by several contributions. First, we propose methods that make the computation of similarity trees efficient for large datasets, and also enhance its visual representation to allow the exploration of more data in a limited screen. Secondly, we propose methods for the visual explanation of <b>multidimensional</b> <b>projections</b> in terms of groups of similar elements. These are automatically annotated to describe which dimensions are more important to define their notion of group similarity. We show next how these explanatory mechanisms can be adapted to handle both static and time-dependent data. Our proposed techniques are designed to be easy to use, work nearly automatically, and are demonstrated on a variety of real-world large data obtained from image collections, text archives, scientific measurements, and software engineering...|$|E

40|$|Most <b>multidimensional</b> <b>projection</b> {{techniques}} rely on distance (dissimilarity) information between data instances {{to embed}} high-dimensional data into a visual space. When data are endowed with Cartesian coordinates, an extra computational effort {{is necessary to}} compute the needed distances, making <b>multidimensional</b> <b>projection</b> prohibitive in applications dealing with interactivity and massive data. The novel <b>multidimensional</b> <b>projection</b> technique proposed in this work, called Part-Linear <b>Multidimensional</b> <b>Projection</b> (PLMP), has been tailored to handle multivariate data represented in Cartesian high-dimensional spaces, requiring only distance information between pairs of representative samples. This characteristic renders PLMP faster than previous methods when processing large data sets while still being competitive in terms of precision. Moreover, knowing the range of variation for data instances in the high-dimensional space, we can make PLMP a truly streaming data projection technique, a trait absent in previous methods.

In recent years, pushed by the ever increasing data complexity in many areas, numerous ad-vances in such techniques have been observed, primarily in terms of computational efficiency and support for interactive applications.

40|$|Abstract—With {{the rapid}} growth of the World Wide Web and {{electronic}} information services, text corpus is becoming available online at an incredible rate. By displaying text data in a logical layout (e. g., color graphs), text visualization presents a direct way to observe the documents as well as understand the relationship between them. In this paper, we propose a novel technique, Exemplarbased Visualization (EV), to visualize an extremely large text corpus. Capitalizing on recent advances in matrix approximation and decomposition, EV presents a probabilistic <b>multidimensional</b> <b>projection</b> model in the low-rank text subspace with a sound objective function. The probability of each document proportion to the topics is obtained through iterative optimization and embedded to a low dimensional space using parameter embedding. By selecting the representative exemplars, we obtain a compact approximation of the data. This makes the visualization highly efficient and flexible. In addition, the selected exemplars neatly summarize the entire data set and greatly reduce the cognitive overload in the visualization, leading to an easier interpretation of large text corpus. Empirically, we demonstrate the superior performance of EV through extensive experiments performed on the publicly available text data sets.

MPs reduce data dimensionality while keeping the original distance structure in the low-dimensional output space, typically shown by a 2 D scatterplot.

In other words, MPs show which points are similar, but not why. We propose a visual approach to describe which dimensions contribute mostly to similarity relationships over the projection, thus explain the projection’s layout. For this, we rank dimensions by increasing variance over each point-neighborhood, and propose a visual encoding to show the least-varying dimensions over each neighborhood.

30|$|The goal of <b>multidimensional</b> <b>projection</b> {{techniques}} is {{to convey}} global similarity relationships amongst high-dimensional data instances by generating a two-dimensional embedding of the data.

It requires a measure of similarity/dissimilarity to be defined, usually approximated by some distance function defined in the high-dimensional data space. Such techniques are closely related with dimensionality reduction and multidimensional scaling (MDS) [12] approaches, which are normally classified into linear or non-linear techniques [13]. Examples of linear techniques are Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [14] and Classical Scaling [12].

However, projection mappings obtained from different techniques vary considerably, and users exploring the mappings or selecting between projection techniques still have limited assistance in their task. Current methods to assess projection quality fail to capture properties that are paramount to user interpretation, such as the capability of conveying class information, or the preservation of groups and neighborhoods from the original space. In this paper we propose a unifying framework to derive objective measures of the local behavior of projection mappings that support interpreting the mappings and comparing solutions regarding several properties. A quality value is computed for each data point, from which a single global value may be also assigned to the projection. Measures are computed from a recently introduced data graph model known as Extended Minimum SpanningTree (EMST). Measurements of the topology of EMST graphs, built relative to the original and projected data representations, are scale independent and afford evaluation of multiple properties. We introduce measures of visual properties and of preservation of properties from the original space.

Nonetheless, any user of search engines could possibly report some experience of disappointment with this metaphor. Indeed, it has limitations in particular situations, as it fails to provide an overview of the document collection retrieved. Moreover, depending {{on the nature of the}} query—for example, it may be too general, or ambiguous, or ill expressed—the desired information may be poorly ranked, or results may contemplate varied topics. Several search tasks would be easier if users were shown an overview of the returned documents, organized so as to reflect how related they are, content wise. We propose a visualization technique to display the results of web queries aimed at overcoming such limitations. It combines the neighborhood preservation capability of <b>multidimensional</b> <b>projections</b> with the familiar snippet-based representation by employing a multidimensional projection to derive two-dimensional layouts of the query search results that preserve text similarity relations, or neighborhoods. Similarity is computed by applying the cosine similarity over a “bag-of-words” vector representation of collection built from the snippets. If the snippets are displayed directly according to the derived layout, they will overlap considerably, producing a poor visualization. We overcome this problem by defining an energy functional that considers both the overlapping among snippets and the preservation of the neighborhood structure as given in the projected layout. Minimizing this energy functional provides a neighborhood preserving two-dimensional arrangement of the textual snippets with minimum overlap.

The successful use of a simple microfluidic e-tongue for soil analysis paves the way for enhanced tools to support precision agriculture...|$|R

The {{generation}} of content-based text maps {{is an important}} issue to support exploration of information and to help find relevant reading material in increasingly complex document databases. Most techniques that help relate or visualize texts rely on a vector representation that is, at its best, ad-hoc as to its parameterization. This paper presents a novel approach capable of generating a map of documents without the painstaking pre-processing steps, by comparing text against text through an approximation of the Kolmogorov complexity. The similarity measure taken from that analysis is then used to map data in 2 D by applying fast <b>multidimensional</b> <b>projection</b> techniques (instead of dimensionality reduction or random initial point placement). The resulting maps show a high degree of content separation and good grouping of similar documents. The approach can be used to map text collections in a variety of applications and the map can be interacted with to further explore text groups. By avoiding vector representation our technique decreases the bias characteristic of that approach and the need for user knowledge of the process. The approach also lends itself to incremental processing for reduction of computational costs. ...|$|R
