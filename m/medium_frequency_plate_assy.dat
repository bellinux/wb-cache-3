The <b>medium</b> <b>frequency</b> {{induction}} furnace power control system of industrial grade includes the microcontroller STC 89 C 52 RC, power converters, data amplifiers, analog to digital converter, stepper motor and excitation regulator, etc. The <b>medium</b> <b>frequency</b> generator’s output {{voltage and current}} signals are passed to the power converter to transform the millivolt DC signal into a linear relationship. The outputs from the power amplifier controlled by the data conversion single-chip are input through the ADC. The signals are compared with the power base value set by the user to calculate the control commands, to control the stepper motor action and control the stepper motor to forward or reverse, {{as well as to}} adjust the excitation current. Therefore, the <b>medium</b> <b>frequency</b> generator output power is stable. The heating temperature of the work pieces are precise controlled.

40|$|Over the postwar, the U. S., Europe and Japan have {{experienced}} {{what may be}} thought of as <b>medium</b> <b>frequency</b> oscillations between persistent periods of robust growth and persistent periods of relative stagnation. These <b>medium</b> <b>frequency</b> movements, further, appear to bear some relation to the high frequency volatility of output. That is, periods of stagnation are often associated with significant recessions, while persistent booms typically are either free of recessions or are interrupted only by very modest downturns. In this paper we explore the idea of medium term cycles, which we define as reflecting the sum of the high and <b>medium</b> <b>frequency</b> variation in the data. We develop a methodology for identifying these kinds of fluctuations and then show that a number of important macroeconomic time series exhibit significant medium term cycles. The cycles feature strong procyclical movements in both disembodied and embodied technological change, research & development, and the efficiency of resource utilization. We then develop a model to explain the medium term cycle that features both disembodied and embodied endogenous technological change, along with countercyclical markups and variable factor utilization. The model is able to generate medium term fluctuations in output, technological change, and resource utilization that resemble the data, with a non-technological shock as the exogenous disturbance. In particular the model offers a unified approach to explaining both high and <b>medium</b> <b>frequency</b> variation in aggregate business activity. ...|$|R
