All that led to and warned on the possibility of summer fishing on high water which had its merits and demerits. Summer fishing is profitable in the intensive production; the market is regularly provided with fish and surpluses make possible the even growth in a pond because the natural food can be better used; the nurture coefficient is diminished; better chemism of water in the pond is being established; the production of thicker fish for market in the fall is being made possible...|$|R
