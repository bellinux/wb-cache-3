40|$|Anonymous {{communications}} systems generally trade off perfor-mance for strong cryptographic guarantees of privacy. However, {{a number of}} applications with moderate performance requirements (e. g., chat) may require both properties. In this paper, we develop a new architecture that provides provably unlinkable and efficient communications using a single intermediary node. Nodes partici-pating in these Mix-In-Place Networks (MIPNets) exchange mes-sages through a mailbox in an Oblivious Proxy (OP). Clients lever-age Secure Function Evaluation (SFE) to send and receive their messages from the OP while blindly but reversibly modifying the appearance of all other messages (i. e., <b>mixing</b> <b>in</b> <b>place)</b> in the mail-box. While an Oblivious Proxy will know that a client participated in exchanges, {{it can not be}} certain which, if any, messages that client transmitted or received. We implement and measure our pro-posed design using a modified version of Fairplay and note reduc-tions in execution times of greater than 98 % over the naïve applica-tion of garbled circuits. We then develop a chat application on top of the MIPNet architecture and demonstrate its practical use for as many as 100 concurrent users. Our results demonstrate the poten-tial to use SFE-enabled “mixing ” in a single proxy as a means of providing provable deniability for applications with near real-time performance requirements. 1...|$|E
40|$|A test {{programme}} {{has been carried}} out in the geotechnical centrifuge of the University of Delft to investigate how different design parameters influence the failure mechanisms and displacements of dikes stabilized by three innovative methods. The three methods under investigation are known as: <b>mixed</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> soil nailing and expanding columns. The tests included models without reinforcements (9 tests) as well as models partly simulating <b>mixed</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> (6 tests), soil nailing (6 tests) and expanding columns (5 tests). Some of these tests are discussed in this report. The parameters tested were expected to have a significant influence on the three innovative methods. Centrifuge research indicates that, in comparison with non-reinforced models, all three innovative methods can improve stability. The extent of the improvement depends heavily on the design parameters, such as the smoothness, the number, the inclination and the stiffness of the reinforcing structural devices. It was possible to adjust the design of all three methods so that the model did not fail. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new {{application of a}} particular machine learning technique for improving wind forecasting. The technique, known as kernel regression, is somewhat similar to fuzzy logic in that both make predictions based on the similarity of the current state to historical training states. Unlike fuzzy logic systems, kernel regression relaxes the requirement for explicit event classifications and instead leverages the training set to form an implicit multidimensional joint density and compute a conditional expectation given any available data. The need for faster, highly accurate, and cost-effective predictive techniques for wind power forecasting is becoming imperative as wind energy becomes a larger contributor to the energy <b>mix</b> <b>in</b> <b>places</b> throughout the world.

See if {{it looks}} {{as if it had been}} built by strong men; if it has the sort of roughness, and largeness, and nonchalance, <b>mixed</b> <b>in</b> <b>places</b> with the {{exquisite}} tenderness which seems always to be the sign-manual of the broad vision, and massy power of men who can see past the work they are doing, and betray here and there something like disdain for it. If the building has this character, it is much already in its favor; it will go hard but it proves a noble one. If it has not this, but is altogether accurate, minute, and scrupulous in its workmanship, it must belong to either the very best or the very worst of schools: the very best, in which exquisite design is wrought out with untiring and conscientious care, as in the Giottesque Gothic; or the very worst, in which mechanism has taken the place of design. It is more likely, in general, that it should belong to the worst than the best: so that, on the whole, very accurate workmanship is to be esteemed a bad sign; and if there is nothing remarkable about the building but its precision, it may be passed at once with contempt.|$|R

40|$|The Pret a Voter schemes allow {{voters to}} confirm that their vote is {{accurately}} counted whilst maintaining ballot secrecy. An earlier version of Pret a Voter uses exponential ElGamal encryption enabling the use of re-encryption <b>mixes</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> of the decryption mixes. To render decryption tractable whilst avoiding the possibility of extreme values compromising ballot privacy, {{it was necessary to}} draw the seed values from a suitable statistical distribution, e. g., a binomial. In this paper we present a similar construction of the ballot forms but using Paillier encryption <b>in</b> <b>place</b> of ElGamal. The homomorphic properties of Paillier make it ideally suited to our construction and removes the need to constrain the distribution of seed values. As with the ElGamal version of the scheme, we have a distributed construction of encrypted ballot forms, though here we give an alternative construction that allows us to set an arbitrary collusion threshold for the leaking ballot information. This enables on-demand decryption and printing of the ballot forms and so eliminates the need to trust a single authority to keep this information secret and avoids chain of custody issues and chain voting style attacks. A number of further innovations are introduced, for example, providing the booth device with a share of the decryption key and transforming the receipt onions into a form directly decryptable in the booth, thus avoiding the need to have the tellers available during the voting period.
