5|$|Cyrenian House, {{the trading}} arm of WA Council on Addictions Inc, is a non-government, not-for-profit {{organisation}} specialising in treatment of {{drug and alcohol}} addictions and is based in North Perth. They operate two facilities off Gnangara Road in Cullacabardee, {{both of which were}} established in 1991 - the Rick Hammersley Centre, a therapeutic community where residents spend 10 weeks, followed by a two-week community re-entry skills development program, and the Saranna Women's Program, a residential village for women affected by addictive or compulsive behaviour and their children, where residents spend a <b>minimum</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> months and also receive assistance for re-entry into the general community.|$|E
5|$|For acute {{cases in}} the leg, the ACCP {{recommended}} a parenteral anticoagulant (such as LMWH, fondaparinux, or unfractionated heparin) {{for at least five}} days and a VKA, the oral anticoagulant, the same day. LMWH and fondaparinux are suggested over unfractionated heparin, but both are retained in those with compromised kidney function, unlike unfractionated heparin. The VKA is generally taken for a <b>minimum</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> months to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2.0–3.0, with 2.5 as the target. The benefit of taking a VKA declines as the duration of treatment extends, and the risk of bleeding increases with age.|$|E

5|$|The {{calculation}} of the general classification changed from the previous editions of the race, shifting to a team-based event, with each team only allowed four riders. Points were awarded to teams based upon winning the stage, having multiple riders in the top four places in each stage, and finishing the stage with a <b>minimum</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> riders. A total of fourteen teams participated, with 56 riders registering and 54 officially starting the race.|$|E
5|$|Because {{there is}} a maximum number of {{established}} positions for ranks warrant officer first class (one per squadron), promotions {{are based on the}} results of a merit review board. The composition of the merit review board includes a <b>minimum</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> to a maximum of five members. As appointed by the squadron commanding officer, members include: Commanding officer (or delegate) acting as board chairperson; Air Cadet League or local sponsor representative; and a minimum of one and maximum of three additional members from the following: representative(s) of the RCSU CO (area Cadet Instructor Cadre officer, regional cadet advisor, area cadet officer, etc.), squadron CIC officer(s) (from within own or members of neighbouring squadrons), and member(s) of the community (to include: school principal, Legion member, etc.). Prior to 1976 the size of the squadron dictated the top rank available and many squadrons were ineligible to carry a WO1 on their establishment effectively capping promotion at WO2 for the squadron's ranking cadet.|$|E
5|$|In 1851 the Supreme Court was reorganized {{under the}} new state constitution. The {{position}} of justice was changed from an appointed position to an elected one. Judicial terms were changed to six years and the Court's size was set to a <b>minimum</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> members and not more than five. The Court's judges quickly became overwhelmed by an ever-increasing caseload. In 1853 the minimum was increased to four members and in 1872 it was increased to five. The Court has remained at a minimum of five justices since that time. In 1867 the general assembly transferred all the law books in the Indiana State Library to the Court to create a Supreme Court Law Library. The library grew to become the primary legal library for the state and includes more than seventy-thousand volumes.|$|E

5|$|Knowles {{teamed with}} America's Second Harvest and Pastor Rudy Rasmus of St. John United Methodist Church for a pre-concert food {{donation}} drive which {{was part of}} The Beyoncé Experience at every stop. Food was collected for people who fought with famine. Knowles' organization The Survivor Foundation was also involved in the campaign. The first 1,000 fans who would drop off a <b>minimum</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> non-perishable food items would receive an autographed photo of Knowles and a raffle ticket for a chance to have an upgraded seat. For the food drive in Ethiopia, India and Turkey, Houston Chronicle collaborated with Knowles, creating a Virtual Aid Drive and asking people to send money to them. The funds were donated to the Global FoodBanking Network.|$|E

He {{purchased}} his commission to lieutenant on 25 December 1787, in the 76th Regiment. As a junior officer he transferred to the 41st Regiment soon after to avoid duty in the East Indies, and in June 1789 transferred again, to the 12th (Prince of Wales's) Light Dragoons cavalry regiment. He obtained his commission to captain on 30 June 1791, in the 58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment, having served the regulation <b>minimum</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> years, and again to major on 30 April 1793, in the 33rd (First Yorkshire West Riding) Regiment, having served six years. He purchased his final commission to lieutenant-colonel on 30 September 1793, {{at the age of}} 24. From there on further promotion could only be attained through seniority, per Army Regulations.|$|E
5|$|To {{amend the}} Constitution, {{one of two}} things must happen before the National Assembly can {{consider}} the measure: The president must suggest the change, or 150,000 eligible voters must send a petition to the National Assembly. Both chambers of the National Assembly must discuss the proposed amendments for a <b>minimum</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> months. Two conditions can prevent a discussion from taking place: Either there is a state of emergency, or there are less than six months in the current term of the House of Representatives. In order for an amendment to take effect, it must be approved by either two-thirds of both chambers of the National Assembly or a simple majority of the voting population of Belarus in a national referendum. The only restriction is that Sections One, Two, Four and Eight can only be changed by national referendum. Rules for conducting a national referendum are enumerated in Chapters 22 through 25 of the Electoral Code of the Republic of Belarus. Since the original adoption of the Constitution in 1994, it has been amended twice; once in 1996 and once in 2004.|$|E

5|$|To {{qualify for}} {{recognition}} by the American Kennel Club, a national breed club must first be established and a written request needs {{to be sent to}} the AKC along with a breed standard. This enables qualification for the Foundation Stock Service. The next step is to qualify to compete in the Miscellaneous Class. This requires a minimum of one hundred active members in the national breed club, along with a <b>minimum</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> to four hundred dogs in the United States with a three generation pedigree (all dogs in those pedigrees must be of the same breed). In addition, they must be geographically spread across twenty states or more, and finally the clubs by-laws and constitution must be reviewed as well as breed observations made by AKC staff. There is a typical stay of between one and three years in the Miscellaneous Class before full recognition is granted. During this time, the breed club must be seen to be active and hold seminars, matches as well as local and national speciality shows. The Kennel Club (UK) does not have a miscellaneous class or foundation stock service, instead it requires British bred dog and three generation pedigrees of them, along with details from the country of origin including the breed standard. This allows listing on the Imported Breeds Register, with full recognition granted at the discretion of the Kennel Club Review Committee.|$|E
5|$|Under {{appellation}} rules, around 4,000 kilograms (8,800 pounds) {{of grapes}} can be pressed to create up to 673 gallons (either 2,550 L or 3,060 L) of juice. The first 541 gallons (either 2,050 L or 2,460 L) are the cuvée {{and the next}} 132 gallons (either 500 L or 600 L) are the taille. Prior to 1992, a second taille of 44 gallons (either 167 L or 200 L) was previously allowed. For vintage Champagne, 100% of the grapes must come from that vintage year while non-vintage wine {{is a blend of}} vintages. Vintage champagne must spend a <b>minimum</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> years of aging. There are no regulations about how long it must spend on its lees, but some of the premier Champagne houses keep their wines on lees for upwards of five to ten years. Non-vintage Champagne must spend a minimum of 15 months of aging but only a minimum of 12 months on the lees. Most of the Champagne houses keep their wines on the lees through the whole time of aging because it is more expense to bottle the wine then age it and finally shipped.|$|E
