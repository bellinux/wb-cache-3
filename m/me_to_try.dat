At one point in the episode, the Simpsons visit the Maasai people, a Nilotic ethnic group of semi-nomadic people located in Kenya and northern Tanzania. The way that some of the Maasai people in the episode are dancing is also true to a traditional dance performed by Maasai people in real life, and although the drinking of cow blood is faithful to the Maasai people's culture, the use of lip plates and neck rings are not.

500|$|In a {{reference}} to the role that earned Irons an Academy Award, Claus von Bülow in Reversal of Fortune (1990), the writers gave Scar one of von Bülow's lines, [...] "You have no idea," [...] which is uttered by Irons in a similar tone. According to author Rachel Stein of New Perspectives on Environmental Justice: Gender, Sexuality, and Activism, Irons relies [...] "on his history of playing sexually perverse, socially dangerous male characters to animate his depiction of Scar." [...] On the contrary, Irons revealed to Connect Savannah that the similarities between the voices of Scar and von Bülow were largely unintentional, explaining, [...] "Whatever voice came was arrived at by looking at the initial sketches, and from the freedom the directors gave <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> anything." [...] Irons concluded, [...] "The fact that he may occasionally remind you of Claus, {{comes from the fact that}} they both share the same voice box." ...|$|E
500|$|Rowland's {{voice is}} {{classified}} as a three-octave lyric mezzo-soprano, and her music includes various styles of musical genres such as contemporary R, pop, hip hop, soul, rock and dance. Her debut solo album Simply Deep (2002) followed an adult-alternative rock sound, while her second album Ms. Kelly (2007) featured an urban sound. In an interview with The Independent, Rowland admitted that with her first two albums she struggled to find her sound. [...] "I was in a stage with the first two records where I was searching and I was like, let me try a rock-dance approach, the label [...] wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> it and I did it...And then after that came a more urban approach with Ms. Kelly in 2007." [...] Her third album Here I Am (2011) consisted of a pop and R sound, with subtle influences of dance. Rowland stated that meeting David Guetta had influenced her to record dance music. During production of the album, Rowland stated {{that part of the}} reason for the new sound on Here I Am was wanting to do something different, saying [...] "I knew I couldn't be afraid of this direction, and I wasn't going to let the thoughts and opinions of others make me afraid to go in this direction".|$|E

During a Yankees' road game at Cleveland, Lofton {{recorded}} his 2,000th career hit. After Lofton's single, Indians fans began an ovation in honor of Lofton. [...] "I didn't know what to expect. I figured I'd get a few claps. It was touching. I tipped my hat, but they just kept going. If there was a storybook {{way for me to}} get it, to get it in Cleveland, it was something to remember." [...] New York finished the regular season with an AL-best record, 10161. To begin the post-season, the Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins, three games to one, in the 2004 ALDS. In the 2004 ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, the Yankees had built a 20 series lead when Lofton stated, [...] "My ultimate goal is for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to win a championship. I'm at a point in my career [...] I've been here for 13 years, and gotten close. This is an opportunity for me to have a chance at it again." [...] Then Yankees would go up in the series three games to none before becoming the first team in MLB history to lose a series after holding a 30 series.|$|E

Newton also acknowledged to Halley that his correspondence with Hooke in 1679–80 had reawakened his dormant interest in astronomical matters, {{but that did not}} mean, according to Newton, that Hooke had told Newton anything new or original: [...] "yet am I not beholden to him for any light into that business but only for the diversion he gave me from my other studies to think on these things & for his dogmaticalness in writing as if he had found the motion in the Ellipsis, which inclined <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{background}} {{described above}} shows there was basis for Newton to deny deriving the inverse square law from Hooke.

She told Entertainment Focus that meeting French DJ David Guetta [...] "changed her perspective and helped to inspire the new sound". She then spent more time in Europe in 2009, something which she said had influenced her. [...] "It's different being over here in Europe and just being able to look at different magazines and fashion shows and things like that.

[...] She noted that seeing people's reactions to dance music made her feel [...] "completely intoxicated!." [...] In July 2010, Rowland said during {{an interview}} with Alex Catarinella of Paper magazine that [...] "I spent about a year of my life in Europe really listening to a whole bunch of European DJs and hearing dance music a lot on the radio and really loving it.
