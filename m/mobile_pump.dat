40|$|Even today, {{there may}} be {{differences}} between the various facilities of fire protection {{in the field of}} portable pumps. Some units have a new and technically compliant <b>mobile</b> <b>pumps,</b> others have older portable pumps or even none. My primary interest was the current state of condition and technical level of the individual pumps. The Pumps and the issue of fire protection are mentioned in the first part. There is described a legal framework defining competencies, division, as well as the working of each fire protection units. Information on the various types of water pumps used not only in fire protection, working principles and specifics of <b>mobile</b> water <b>pumps</b> are also described here in a retrieval of information resources. The second part, which is my own research, is analysis of condition of <b>mobile</b> water <b>pumps</b> on selected sample of fire protection units from the region of Liberec. This practical task was realized by my myself questionnaires that I sent out to chosen fire protection units. Additional information was acquired thanks to personal interviews with representatives of the units. My field of interest was the quality of condition of <b>mobile</b> water <b>pumps.</b> The finally condition depends on the fact if the fire units own the pumps and their technical level. The monitored parameters were old pumps, maximum power, maximum discharge height, weight and maximum flow rate of the pump. The quality of the conditions of <b>mobile</b> water <b>pumps</b> of fire protection units was evaluated by using my own modification of operational analysis. The index of condition as a unique identifier was the outcome of the evaluation. The hypothesis The condition of <b>mobile</b> water <b>pumps</b> of chosen fire protection units corresponds today's technical possibilities - had prescientific character and it was formulated intuitively. The hypothesis also contained expectations of high and technically adequate condition of <b>mobile</b> water <b>pumps</b> of chosen fire protection units. Basis for the hypothesis flowed from the experience of recent years, when the fire brigade were gradually upgraded its founders. Based on the results it is possible to confirm the hypothesis and indicate the condition of chosen fire protection units from the region of Liberec as a sufficient because all of them pass the basic limit. To achieve four specific aims of this work the comparison of monitored technical parameters and the number of pumps with limit for condition was used. These aims of the thesis were complete thanks to these methods except one. It was the plan of modernization at the fire protection unit, which does not correspond amenities. Since the confirmation of the hypothesis, which states that <b>mobile</b> <b>pumps</b> amenities for today's technical possibilities, no need to drive to modernize the newer models. You are at least mentioned in the results of the work, and their technical parameters are included in the annex. If we take into account the practical point of view, this work is useful for the Fire Brigade Liberec region, such as document monitoring conditions of <b>mobile</b> water <b>pumps</b> of chosen fire protection unit from Liberec region...|$|R

An inflatable dam was often used as the source for the relay, usually fed by using several Light Portable Pumps powered by Coventry Climax FWP engines. Water could be drawn from 'open water' supplies (Rivers, lakes or reservoirs) by a Transportable Water Unit more commonly known as 'Bikini Units'.

40|$|The loss of {{the primary}} heat sink {{is one of the}} most {{relevant}} BDBA scenarios. If the capability to remove heat from the primary side cannot be restored, the primary side will be subjected to high pressure for a long period of time. The actuation of the ECCS will be inhibited, primary side (PS) inventory will be lost, ﬁnally the core will be in dryout conditions. The EOP which is investigated in this paper proposes to utilise <b>mobile</b> <b>pumps</b> (e. g. using ﬁre brigade trucks) to make additional sources of feedwater available and thereby restore a heat sink for the primary side at least for a limited period of time. After a certain time (which should be determined by calculations) of this measure, the PORV-valve and/or the gas-removal system should be opened to lower the pressure in the primary side and actuate the ECCS (primary side bleed and feed mode).

50|$|The Warsaw Fire Brigade {{was created}} on December 23, 1834, by the Administrative Council of the Kingdom of Poland. It {{was to be}} modeled after a similar {{fire-fighting}} unit created in Saint Petersburg only a year earlier. On February 6 of the following year Lt. Colonel Jan Robosz became the first Fire Chief of Fire Guard in Warsaw. The organization of the unit ended on January 1, 1836, and it began its duty. Initially named Fire Guard in Warsaw (Straż Ogniowa w Warszawie), in 1841 it was renamed to Warsaw Fire Guard (Warszawska Straż Ogniowa). The Guard was entitled with all maintenance duties in the city, including putting down fires and fire prevention, but also cleaning the chimneys and the streets. It was divided onto four departments, each of them responsible for a different borough of Warsaw. In 1851 an additional department was created for the borough of Mirów. In 1864 the Guards received the first steam engine-operated <b>mobile</b> <b>pump,</b> manufactured by a London-based F. Shand, Mason and Co. firm. The following year two additional vehicles arrived, thus making the Warsaw Fire Guard one of the best-equipped fire units in continental Europe.

40|$|The PETRA {{storage ring}} at DESY will be {{upgraded}} {{to a third}} generation synchrotron radiation source with 15 beamlines in the PETRA III project [1]. <b>Mobile</b> <b>pumping</b> stations will be needed for the initial pump down of the beamlines and beamline components to a hydrocarbon-free and particle-free ultra-high vacuum [2]. They will be placed at the disposal for users to pump down and bake their experimental chambers and for leak detection.

50|$|Every reactor has {{at least}} one steam driven {{feedwater}} pump which can supply the steam generators with water to cool down the reactor. These turbine driven pumps can cool down the plant even when no electrical power is available to power the motor driven feedwater pumps during a station blackout like the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. In a boiling water reactor, like those in Fukushima, the heat removal capacity of the pumps is limited as the steam that drives the turbines is radioactive and thus has to be stored. This is not the case with a PWR due to the use of steam generators. Steam can simply be removed via a chimney. Autonomy is merely limited by the supplies of water on site. The initial supply of water in the reservoir is sufficient for almost 24 hours. After those 24 hours <b>mobile</b> <b>pumps</b> are used to fill up the reservoir.|$|R
