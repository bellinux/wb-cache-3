5|$|A {{number of}} {{protective}} {{measures have been}} implemented, including site access restrictions, the collection and cold-storage of seed, and the treatment of plants with phosphite. Phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> managed {{as studies have shown}} that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth. Direct injection of phosphite into the stem of each tree appears to lack this disadvantage, but is costly to administer and restricted to known plants.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{individuals}} with MS were advised against participation {{in physical activity}} due to worsening symptoms. However, {{under the direction of}} an expert, participation in physical activity can be safe and has been proven beneficial for persons with MS. Research has supported the rehabilitative role of physical activity in improving muscle power, mobility, mood, bowel health, general conditioning and quality of life. Depending on the person, activities may include resistance training, walking, swimming, yoga, tai chi, and others. Determining an appropriate and safe exercise program is challenging and <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> individualized to each person being sure to account for all contraindications and precautions.|$|E

5|$|Unless a star {{is being}} {{observed}} {{from the direction}} of its pole, sections of the surface have some amount of movement toward or away from the observer. The component of movement that is {{in the direction of the}} observer is called the radial velocity. For the portion of the surface with a radial velocity component toward the observer, the radiation is shifted to a higher frequency because of Doppler shift. Likewise the region that has a component moving away from the observer is shifted to a lower frequency. When the absorption lines of a star are observed, this shift at each end of the spectrum causes the line to broaden. However, this broadening <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> separated from other effects that can increase the line width.|$|E
5|$|Banksia verticillata {{has been}} {{declared}} vulnerable under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, and Rare under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. A 1995 census yielded an estimated total population size of 4500 plants. Apart from dieback and aerial canker, frequency of bushfires and illegal picking have been cited as threats. Ongoing management includes monitoring of current populations, gathering more data on best response to fire, and restricting access to populations. Seed has been collected from many populations, but germination rates after ten years of storage are much lower than in Banksia brownii. Translocation is considered an option in the future, as is spraying with phosphite, particularly {{in the vicinity of}} Walpole. Used successfully on B.brownii but as yet untrialled with B.verticillata, phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> managed as studies have shown that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth.|$|E

25|$|This {{solution}} {{has many}} unusual properties—in particular, {{the existence of}} closed timelike curves that would allow time travel in a universe described by the solution. Its definition is somewhat artificial in {{that the value of}} the cosmological constant <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> chosen to match the density of the dust grains, but this spacetime is an important pedagogical example.|$|E

25|$|It is also {{possible}} that what we see as a cratonic margin today were created by the action of a plume event initiating a continental rifting episode; therefore the tectonic setting of most large layered complexes <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> weighed in terms of geochemistry {{and the nature of the}} host sequence, and in some cases a mixed mechanism cause is possible.|$|E
25|$|The evaporator, turbine, and {{condenser}} {{operate in}} partial vacuum ranging from 3% to 1% of atmospheric pressure. The system <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> sealed to prevent in-leakage of atmospheric air that can degrade or shut down operation. In closed-cycle OTEC, the specific volume of low-pressure steam is very large {{compared to that}} of the pressurized working fluid. Components must have large flow areas to ensure steam velocities do not attain excessively high values.|$|E
25|$|Game Paks are {{far more}} durable than compact discs, the latter of which <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> used and stored in {{protective}} cases. It also prevents accidental scratches and subsequent read errors. While Game Paks are more resistant than CDs to physical damage, they are sometimes less resistant to long-term environmental damage, particularly oxidation (although this can be simply cleaned off) or wear of their electrical contacts causing a blank or frozen screen, or static electricity.|$|E

25|$|The {{hydraulic}} jump {{is the most}} commonly used choice of design engineers for energy dissipation below spillways and outlets. A properly designed {{hydraulic jump}} can provide for 60-70% energy dissipation of the energy in the basin itself, limiting the damage to structures and the streambed. Even with such efficient energy dissipation, stilling basins <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> designed to avoid serious damage due to uplift, vibration, cavitation, and abrasion. An extensive literature has been developed for this type of engineering.|$|E
25|$|Most {{distributions}} install packages, {{including the}} kernel and other core operating system components, in a predetermined configuration. Few now require or even permit configuration adjustments at first install time. This makes installation less daunting, particularly for new users, {{but is not}} always acceptable. For specific requirements, much software <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> configured to be useful, to work correctly with other software, or to be secure, and local administrators are often obliged to spend time reviewing and reconfiguring assorted software.|$|E
25|$|Rectifiers {{are also}} used for {{detection}} of amplitude modulated radio signals. The signal may be amplified before detection. If not, a very low voltage drop diode or a diode biased with a fixed voltage must be used. When using a rectifier for demodulation the capacitor and load resistance <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> matched: too low a capacitance makes the high frequency carrier pass to the output, and too high makes the capacitor just charge and stay charged.|$|E

25|$|Being a {{powerful}} oxidizing acid, nitric acid reacts violently with many organic {{materials and the}} reactions may be explosive. The hydroxyl group will typically strip a hydrogen from the organic molecule to form water, and the remaining nitro group takes the hydrogen's place. Nitration of organic compounds with nitric acid is the primary method of synthesis of many common explosives, such as nitroglycerin and trinitrotoluene (TNT). As very many less stable byproducts are possible, these reactions <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> thermally controlled, and the byproducts removed to isolate the desired product.|$|E
25|$|Warfarin {{and other}} 4-hydroxycoumarins block {{the action of}} VKOR. This results in {{decreased}} concentrations of vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone in tissues, such that the carboxylation reaction catalyzed by the glutamyl carboxylase is inefficient. This results {{in the production of}} clotting factors with inadequate Gla. Without Gla on the amino termini of these factors, they no longer bind stably to the blood vessel endothelium and cannot activate clotting to allow formation of a clot during tissue injury. As it is impossible to predict what dose of warfarin will give the desired degree of clotting suppression, warfarin treatment <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> monitored to avoid overdose.|$|E
25|$|The goal of fMRI data {{analysis}} is to detect correlations between brain activation and a task the subject performs during the scan. It also aims to discover correlations {{with the specific}} cognitive states, such as memory and recognition, induced in the subject. The BOLD signature of activation is relatively weak, however, so other sources of noise in the acquired data <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> controlled. This means that a series of processing steps must be performed on the acquired images before the actual statistical search for task-related activation can begin. Nevertheless, {{it is possible to}} predict, for example, the emotions a person is experiencing solely from their fMRI, {{with a high degree of}} accuracy.|$|E
