5|$|The {{entire day}} of a Jain monk is spent in {{ensuring}} that he observes his vow of ahimsa through mind, body and speech faultlessly. This seemingly extreme behaviour of the monks comes from a sense that every action, no <b>matter</b> <b>however</b> subtle, has a karmic effect which can bind soul and inhibit liberation, especially those that result in hiṃsā (injury).|$|E
5|$|In a loose, {{unstructured}} modernist narrative {{style that}} draws from Christian allegory and oral storytelling, Faulkner explores themes of race, sex, class and {{religion in the}} American South. By focusing on characters that are misfits, outcasts, or are otherwise marginalized in their community, he portrays the clash of alienated individuals against a Puritanical, prejudiced rural society. Early reception of the novel was mixed, with some reviewers critical of Faulkner's style and subject <b>matter.</b> <b>However,</b> over time, the novel {{has come to be}} {{considered one of the most}} important literary works by Faulkner and one of the best English-language novels of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Montenegro coach Sava Kovačević, {{whose team}} {{was knocked out}} by Bolivia in the semifinals, said that Montenegro would ask {{football}} governing body FIFA {{to look into the}} <b>matter.</b> <b>However,</b> FIFA announced they would not be doing so as complaints concerning the eligibility of players should have been submitted in writing to FIFA's headquarters in Singapore at the Youth Olympic Games no later than five days before the first match, that is, by 8 August. FIFA also said that its staff had met all footballers individually at the Olympic Village and had checked their passports against their dates of birth provided by their respective National Olympic Committees.|$|E

5|$|The {{complex of}} {{refining}} and chemical companies is called Chemical Valley and located south of downtown Sarnia. While in 2011 {{the city had}} {{the highest level of}} particulates air pollution of any Canadian city, it has since dropped down to 30th. About 60 percent of the particulate <b>matter,</b> <b>however,</b> comes from the neighboring United States. Lake Huron is cooler than the air in summer and warmer than the air in winter; therefore, it moderates Sarnia's humid continental climate, which makes temperature extremes of hot and cold less evident. In the winter, Sarnia occasionally experiences lake-effect snow from Arctic air blowing across the warmer waters of Lake Huron and condensing to form snow squalls once over land.|$|E
5|$|For Operation Barbarossa, the 3rd Panzer Division was {{assigned}} to the XXIV Panzer Corps, itself part of the Second Panzer Group, commanded by Heinz Guderian. The campaign opened on 22 June 1941, with Guderian urging his divisions forward at breakneck speed. This suited Model, and by 4 July, his advance elements leading the panzer group's charge had reached the Dnieper, an exploit that earned him the Knight's Cross. Crossing it in strength was another <b>matter,</b> <b>however,</b> as the Red Army was prepared to defend the river line. 3rd Panzer's vanguard was thrown back by the Soviet 21st Army, and it was not until 10 July that the Germans were in a position to force a crossing. For this operation, Model, now reinforced with additional troops, reorganized his command into three groups: an infantry-heavy force that would cross the river and establish a bridgehead, a mobile armoured group that would pass through the bridgehead and continue the advance, and a fire support group containing nearly all his artillery. The plan worked so successfully that the river crossing cost scarcely any casualties. There followed two weeks of hard fighting to defend the panzer group's flank, during which he {{was assigned}} the 1st Cavalry Division in addition to 3rd Panzer as Gruppe Model, who then attacked to break up Soviet forces massing near Roslavl.|$|E

The following year, Governor George Whitefield Davis ordered the annexation of Barceloneta into Manatí. The annexation was short-lived, though; 11 years later, the government reinstated Barceloneta as a municipality.|$|E
25|$|The New Encyclopedia of Islam {{states that}} after the early period, with some notable exceptions, the {{practice}} in Islam regarding atheism or various forms of heresy, grew more tolerant {{as long as it}} was a private <b>matter.</b> <b>However</b> heresy and atheism expressed in public may well be considered a scandal and a menace to a society; in some societies they are punishable, at least to the extent the perpetrator is silenced.

25|$|The {{idea of an}} {{electromagnetic}} {{nature of}} <b>matter,</b> <b>however,</b> had to be given up. Abraham (1904, 1905) argued that non-electromagnetic forces were necessary to prevent Lorentz's contractile electrons from exploding. He also showed that different results for the longitudinal electromagnetic mass can be obtained in Lorentz's theory, {{depending on whether the}} mass is calculated from its energy or its momentum, so a non-electromagnetic potential (corresponding to 1/3 of the electron's electromagnetic energy) was necessary to render these masses equal. Abraham doubted whether it was possible to develop a model satisfying all of these properties.|$|E
25|$|Browder {{allowed the}} Foster-Darcy letter to be {{circulated}} {{only to a}} handful of top party leaders, who at a February 1944 meeting of the Politburo voted to reject the letter. Foster's objection was muted when Browder emphasized that open criticism would have been regarded as a punishable breach of party discipline. Darcy refused to submit to party discipline on this <b>matter,</b> <b>however,</b> viewing it as a matter of fundamental principle. He was subsequently expelled from the CPA by a committee headed by Foster himself.|$|E
25|$|Spencer {{argued that}} both these {{theories}} were partial {{accounts of the}} truth: repeated associations of ideas were embodied {{in the formation of}} specific strands of brain tissue, and these could be passed {{from one generation to the}} next by means of the Lamarckian mechanism of use-inheritance. The Psychology, he believed, would do for the human mind what Isaac Newton had done for <b>matter.</b> <b>However,</b> the book was not initially successful and the last of the 251 copies of its first edition was not sold until June 1861.|$|E

To further ensure shareholder approval, Wachovia issued Wells Fargo preferred stock that holds 39.9% of the voting power in the company.|$|E
25|$|Lorentz's {{theory was}} criticized by Abraham, who {{demonstrated}} that {{on one side}} the theory obeys the relativity principle, {{and on the other}} side the electromagnetic origin of all forces is assumed. Abraham showed, that both assumptions were incompatible, because in Lorentz's theory of the contracted electrons, non-electric forces were needed in order to guarantee the stability of <b>matter.</b> <b>However,</b> in Abraham's theory of the rigid electron, no such forces were needed. Thus the question arose whether the Electromagnetic conception of the world (compatible with Abraham's theory) or the Relativity Principle (compatible with Lorentz's Theory) was correct.|$|E
25|$|That a Muslim {{should take}} in {{marriage}} one of alien faith is not objected to; {{it is rather}} deemed a meritorious act thus to bring an unbeliever to the true religion. The Muslim woman, on the other hand, must not be given in marriage to a non-Muslim; such a union {{is regarded as the}} most heinous of sins. In this <b>matter,</b> <b>however,</b> compromises are sometimes made with heaven: the marriage of a Turki princess with the emperor Ch'ien-lung has already been referred to; and, when the present writer passed through Minjol (a day's journey west of Kashgar) in 1902, a Chinese with a Turki wife (? concubine) was presented to him.|$|E
