50|$|After his {{experience}} in apnea diving Redl took his love for underwater sports {{to the next level}} by creating Underwater Ice Hockey while also starting a school to teach people how to properly free dive. Organizer Christian Redl said: 'After diving a lot under ice, I wondered which sports had the potential to be played underneath ice and that's when the hockey game was born. The matches are very fast paced, so {{the amount of time that}} divers are under the water is not that long - plus the water is extremely cold and you can get disorientated very easily.' Furthermore, Christian Redl has seen some success in television and film with being a stuntman in television broadcasts like <b>Medicopter</b> 117 and Coast Guard and appearing on TV-Total Late night show with Stefan Raab in 1999. Redl’s activities in apnea diving and Underwater Ice Hockey has put him in a good position to be a stuntman. Another thing he has done in his film career was a little known music video called “On My Way” by DJ Friction, which involves underwater ice diving. Also, in 2002 Redl went to Roatan Island to film an advertising film for Seimens medical, which also involves diving. On top of his film career, Redl has also written some book about his life, projects, and free diving. A couple of these books are called “Free diving - My World in Pictures” in 2006 and “Mastering Boundaries through Mental Strength - Safe Diving” in 2010. One of the last achievements that stands Redl out from the crowd is that he does not confine himself to one location or hemisphere to do what he loves. He takes his love all over the world, from the North Pole: Greenland and Iceland to Antarctica where he continues to push the limits of the human body. All of these achievements are proof that anyone can take a childhood dream and make a successful career out of it.|$|E

As a part of a SMS, Flight Safety Training (FST) is included, which consist of Human factors, Crew Resource Management (CRM) -training and the creation/shaping of attitudes and safety culture. During 2012 a SMS was implemented in Scandinavian <b>MediCopter</b> Ab. This study attempts to discover if the implementation of the FST tool in the SMS has an effect on how professional aviators speak about safety and how the training curriculum is affected. For the qualitative research nine professional pilots and flight instructors working with FST and duty in a Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) -organization were interviewed about how they perceive the language and syllabus change during the last five years. Additionally the training curriculum was reviewed both before and after the implementation of the SMS. The results imply that language change is difficult to connect to implementing a SMS alone. The change can arguably be seen as bein...|$|E
