5|$|In modern thought, {{the orbits}} of the planets are viewed as the paths of those planets through mostly empty space. Ancient and medieval thinkers, however, {{considered}} the celestial orbs to be thick spheres of rarefied matter nested one within the other, each one in complete contact with the sphere above it and the sphere below. When scholars applied Ptolemy's epicycles, they presumed that each planetary sphere was exactly thick enough to accommodate them. By combining this nested sphere model with astronomical observations, scholars calculated what became generally accepted values at {{the time for the}} distances to the Sun (about 4 <b>million</b> <b>miles),</b> to the other planets, and {{to the edge of the}} universe (about 73 <b>million</b> <b>miles).</b> The nested sphere model's distances to the Sun and planets differ significantly from modern measurements of the distances, and the size of the universe is now known to be inconceivably large and possibly infinite.|$|E
5|$|Large lengths, such as {{the radius}} of a giant star or the semi-major axis of a binary star system, are often {{expressed}} in terms of the astronomical unit — approximately equal to the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun (150 million km or approximately 93 <b>million</b> <b>miles).</b> In 2012, the IAU defined the astronomical constant to be an exact length in meters: 149,597,870,700 m.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, CAP {{was seen}} as a way to use America's {{civilian}} aviation resources to aid the war effort instead of grounding them. The organization assumed many missions including anti-submarine patrol and warfare, border patrols, and courier services.

5|$|Paul W. Fairman {{replaced}} Browne {{as editor}} in September 1956. Early in Fairman's tenure, Bernard Davis {{decided to try}} issuing a companion series of novels, titled Amazing Stories Science Fiction Novels. Readers' letters in Amazing had indicated a desire for novels, which Amazing did not have room to run. The novel series did not last; only one, Henry Slesar's 20 <b>Million</b> <b>Miles</b> to Earth, appeared. However, in response to readers' interest in longer fiction, Ziff-Davis expanded Amazing by 16 pages, starting with the March 1958 issue, and the magazine began to run complete novels.|$|E
5|$|The {{death rate}} per 100 <b>million</b> <b>miles</b> {{traveled}} in 2015 ranged from 0.52 in Massachusetts to 1.89 in South Carolina. (The Massachusetts rate translates to about 3.25 fatalities per 1 billion vehicle-km. The South Carolina rate translates to about 11.8 fatalities per 1 billion vehicle-km.) In South Carolina, North Dakota and Texas, more than 40% of road fatalities {{were attributed to}} {{driving under the influence}} (DUI). A plot of vehicle-miles traveled per capita vs fatalities per 100,000 population shows Montana, South Carolina and West Virginia as outliers with higher than expected fatalities.|$|E
5|$|The primary (IK Pegasi A) is an A-type {{main-sequence star}} that {{displays}} minor pulsations in luminosity. It is categorized as a Delta Scuti variable star {{and it has}} a periodic cycle of luminosity variation that repeats itself about 22.9 times per day. Its companion (IK Pegasi B) is a massive white dwarf—a star that has evolved past the main sequence and is no longer generating energy through nuclear fusion. They orbit each other every 21.7 days with an average separation of about 31 million kilometres, or 19 <b>million</b> <b>miles,</b> or 0.21 astronomical units (AU). This is smaller than the orbit of Mercury around the Sun.|$|E

5|$|The {{series is}} named after Spica, a binary star system in the {{constellation}} Virgo {{and one of the}} brightest stars in the nighttime sky. It appears as one star because of the relatively low center-to-center distance between the two component stars, estimated at an average of 11 <b>million</b> <b>miles</b> (17.7 million km). Astronomical observations also suggest that there may be additional stars in the Spica system. In the story, Asumi mentions Spica's distance to Earth as 350 light-years. This figure is also cited by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency; however, other sources indicate a distance of approximately 260 light-years.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{accident}} rate per 100 <b>million</b> <b>miles</b> for professional truckers is low, {{the high number}} of miles driven by a truck driver makes truck driving a risky occupation. Trucking transportation occupations accounted for one quarter of all work-related fatalities in 2015, more than any other U.S. job, according to the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics' annual workplace fatality report. The fatal injury rate in 2015 was 14.7 per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers in transportation and material moving occupations (which includes both truckers and air transportation workers.) This was a significantly lower rate than for workers in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations, but high compared to most other occupation categories. The report did not break out the fatal injury rate per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers among aircraft pilots and flight engineers but did note that they had a high fatal injury rate compared to all workers. There were 57 fatalities among aircraft pilots and flight engineers in 2015.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years, the telescope {{was used to}} track a variety of space probes. Between 11 March and 12 June 1960, it tracked the Pioneer 5 probe. The telescope was also used to send commands to the probe, including the one to separate the probe from its carrier rocket and the ones {{to turn on the}} more powerful transmitter when the probe was eight <b>million</b> <b>miles</b> away. It also received data from the probe, being the only telescope in the world capable of doing so at the time.Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, p. 272 In February 1966, Jodrell Bank was asked by the Soviet Union to track the USSR unmanned moon lander Luna 9 and recorded on its facsimile transmission of photographs from the moon's surface. The photos were sent to the British press and published before the Soviets themselves had made the photos public.|$|E

2500|$|The cost {{of light}} rail {{construction}} varies widely, largely {{depending on the}} amount of tunneling and elevated structures required. A survey of North American light rail projects shows that costs of most LRT systems range from $15 million to over $100 <b>million</b> per <b>mile.</b> Seattle's new light rail system {{is by far the most}} expensive in the US, at $179 <b>million</b> per <b>mile,</b> since it includes extensive tunneling in poor soil conditions, elevated sections, and stations as deep as [...] below ground level. This results in costs more typical of subways or rapid transit systems than light rail. At the other end of the scale, four systems (Baltimore, Maryland; Camden, New Jersey; Sacramento, California; and Salt Lake City, Utah) incurred construction costs of less than $20 <b>million</b> per <b>mile.</b> Over the US as a whole, excluding Seattle, new light rail construction costs average about $35 <b>million</b> per <b>mile.</b>|$|R

5|$|Safety overall has {{steadily}} improved in the United States for many decades. Between 1920 and 2000, {{the rate of}} fatal automobile accidents per vehicle-mile decreased {{by a factor of}} about 17. Except for a pause during the youth bulge of the 1960s (a time when many young, inexperienced drivers were on the road), progress in reducing fatal accidents has been steady. Safety for other types of U.S. passenger transportation has also improved substantially, but long-term statistical data are not as readily available. While the fatality rate roughly leveled off around 2000–2005 at around 1.5 fatalities per 100 <b>million</b> <b>miles</b> traveled, it has resumed a downward trend and reached 1.27 in 2008. The National Safety Council (whose data methodology differs slightly from the NHTSA) reports a rate (including deaths of pedestrians and cyclists killed in motor vehicle accidents) of 1.25 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles (or 12.5 deaths per billion vehicle miles) traveled in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The Lovell Telescope {{was used}} to track both Soviet and American probes aimed at the Moon in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In terms of American space probes, the {{telescope}} tracked Pioneer 1 from 11 to 13 November 1958, Pioneer 3 in December 1958, and Pioneer 4 in March 1959. The telescope tracked Pioneer 5 between 11 March and 26 June 1960, and was also used to send commands to the probe, including the one to separate the probe from its carrier rocket and the ones {{to turn on the}} more powerful transmitter when the probe was 8 <b>million</b> <b>miles</b> (12.9 million km) away. It also received data from Pioneer 5, and was the only telescope in the world capable of doing so at the time.Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, p. 272 The last signal was picked up from the probe at a distance of 36.2 million kilometers on the 26 June 1960.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{biosphere}} {{has significantly}} altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved , forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today. This change enabled {{the proliferation of}} aerobic organisms and, indirectly, {{the formation of the}} ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature. This last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18°C, in contrast to the current +15°C, and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a <b>million</b> <b>miles</b> away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.|$|E
