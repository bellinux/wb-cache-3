50|$|It must be {{emphasized}} that individuals without HPPD will sometimes notice visual abnormalities. These include floaters (<b>material</b> <b>floating</b> in the eye fluid that appears as black/dark objects floating {{in front of the}} eyes and are particularly visible when looking at the bright sky or on a white wall) and the white blood cells of the retinal blood vessels (seen as tiny, fast-moving and quickly disappearing white specks). Likewise, bright lights in an otherwise dark environment may generate trails and halos. Most people don't notice these effects, because they are so used to them. A person fearful of having acquired HPPD may be much more conscious about any visual disturbance, including those that are normal. In addition, visual problems can be caused by migraines, brain infections or lesions, epilepsy, and a number of mental disorders (e.g., delirium, dementia, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease). For an individual to be diagnosed with HPPD, these other potential causes must be ruled out.|$|E

40|$|We review first some {{laboratory}} studies that illustrate {{some of the}} nonlinearities that arise in geophysical flows. These include convection cells, viscous conduits, waves on the conduits due to changing sources and due to tilt of the conduits. Next, we illustrate fingering structures that result when flows alter their surroundings to retard their continuation. This is typical as hot material from deep in the earth rises to shallow regions where cooling is encountered. We then described recent work concerning the relation between convection cells and <b>material</b> <b>floating</b> at the surface. This is motivated from factors governing convection in the mantle of the earth. Continents are thickened when they collide or when they override ocean trenches. This might retard mantle flow, and it clearly influences {{the thickness of the}} continental crust. Other estimates of continental deformation suggest that continents slowly spread out by slow internal deformation and erosion. The link between the surface deflection of a floating layer and the parameters of cellular flow below the layer are quantified.

40|$|If blood flowing {{within the}} blood vessels of the body stops, the tissue it {{supplies}} could die from lack of oxygen. If, after a serious wound, blood flowing outside the body does not stop, a person could die from hemorrhage. Yet, the blood within {{the blood vessels}} flows almost perfectly throughout life, and bleeding usually stops within minutes after a cut. Occasionally, blood can clot within the blood vessels, which is called a thrombus. Abnormal <b>material</b> <b>floating</b> in the blood is called an embolus. A thrombus that breaks free and floats in the moving bloodstream is called a thromboembolism. The blood in the veins, with its slow flow and low pressure, {{is more likely to}} clot (venous thrombus) than blood in the arteries; it may go to the lungs (pulmonary embolism or venous thromboembolism), where it can become lodged in the small blood vessels. An embolism can also be caused by other <b>material</b> <b>floating</b> free in the bloodstream, as in, for example, tumor embolism or foreign-body embolism, but these conditions are rare compared to thromboemboli and are not considered further in this chapter.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} the production of thin films of porous, hydrophobic sol-gel materials that can be made hydrophilic if treated in certain ways.

When made hydrophilic the materials imbibe water, the pores fill rapidly and they sink. We demonstrate the use of these foam materials as detectors, using the transition from superhydrophobicity to imbibition as an indicator for maximum temperature reached, for concentration of surfactant or for measuring ethanol concentration in water...|$|R

Its rapid and effective dispersal, largely as plant fragments, {{and its ability}} to displace other macrophyte species through competition are major factors. Problems typically caused by Eurasian watermilfoil result from the large amounts of plant material that it produces near the water's surface.

The maximum of the sound pressure and of the frequency of the impact sound are significantly different for floors with different types of insulation.

An in-built thermostat maintains the set temperature of the bed, which can be changed according to the need of the patient.
