Numerical {{modelling}} {{and experimental}} measurements {{led to the}} assessment of stress of structural nodes of scissor <b>lifting</b> <b>platform,</b> which is used for relocation of cars from a production line. It also led to the optimization of producing process. Immediate load of scissor <b>lifting</b> <b>platform</b> by a car on stand causes additional bending moment that must be captured in a scissor mechanism. At the beginning the experimental measurements on the real <b>lifting</b> <b>platform</b> were made for obtaining of dependence of displacement, velocity and acceleration on time, which was almost 1. 5 ± 0. 1 g. Then a dynamical analysis of <b>lifting</b> <b>platform</b> was performed using the numerical method Runge Kutta 4 th order. Model analysis showed that the initial immediate acceleration of <b>lifting</b> <b>platform</b> at start and immediate deceleration at stop lead to dynamic shocks. These dynamic shocks are dangerous due to a long term operation because they permanently load not only pivots but also other parts – bearings and joining parts. A resonance may occur as well. In particular, dynamic shocks caused damage of structural nodes. Immediate load of scissor <b>lifting</b> <b>platform</b> by a car on stand causes additional bending moment. It is not appropriate {{in terms of a}} long-term operation. The recommended load <b>lifting</b> <b>platform</b> should be symmetrical...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} a vision-based control {{approach}} for autonomously docking a wheelchair onto a vehicle <b>lift</b> <b>platform.</b> This is a principle component of the Automated Transport and Retrieval System (ATRS) - an alternate mobility solution for drivers with lower body disabilities. The ATRS employs robotics, automation, and machine vision technologies, and can be integrated into a standard minivan or sport utility vehicle (SUV). At {{the core of the}} ATRS is a “smart ” wheelchair system that autonomously navigates between the driver’s position and a powered lift {{at the rear of the}} vehicle- eliminating the need for an attendant. From an automation perspective, autonomously docking the wheelchair onto the <b>lift</b> <b>platform</b> presented the most significant technical challenge for the proof-of-concept ATRS. This was driven primarily by geometry constraints, which limited clearance between the chair wheels and the <b>lift</b> <b>platform</b> rails. We present significant simulation and experimental results for our approach. These indicate that the coupling of visionbased localization for feedback and input/output feedback linearization techniques for controller design can provide for accurate wheelchair navigation and reliable docking under a range of ambient illumination conditions.
