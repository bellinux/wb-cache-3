50|$|An Aircraft Incident <b>Management</b> <b>Procedure</b> (Dutch: Vliegtuigongevalscenario or VOS) is a Dutch {{standard}} Incident Mamangement Procedure for incidents {{at or near}} airports involving one or more aircraft. This is {{the aviation}} specific Coordinated Regional Incident <b>Management</b> <b>Procedure</b> or CRIMP (Dutch: Gecoördineerde Regionale Incidentbestrijdings Procedure) or GRIP. A VOS arranges the amount of emergency services and support by air-side and/or land-side operations of the airport. There are some small differences in naming the VOS at the respective airports in the Netherlands, but the incident management is generally the same.|$|E

40|$|Risk {{management}} {{has become an}} important topic for financial institutes, especially since the business sector of financial services is related to conditions of uncertainty. The turmoil of the financial industry {{emphasizes the importance of}} effective risk <b>management</b> <b>procedures.</b> Consequently, this thesis studies “What are the critical success factors for effective risk <b>management</b> <b>procedures</b> in financial industries?” This research question was formulated in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of risk <b>management</b> <b>procedures</b> and to examine the critical success factors for effective risk <b>management</b> <b>procedures.</b> To explore the importance of critical success factors in a practical context, we used the quantitative method of a self-completion questionnaire in order to collect data from a selection of financial institutions in Thailand. Financial institutions include banks, the stock exchange, insurance, stock securities, asset management and so on. Due to the fact that top-level management is directly responsible for risk management, the target groups included a range of positions from supervisors to board of directors. This research found a set of seven critical success factors which can be used as a guideline on how to increase the effectiveness of risk <b>management</b> <b>procedures.</b> These factors are (1). Commitment and support from top management, (2) Communication, (3) Culture, (4) Information technology (IT), (5) Organization structure, (6) Training and (7) Trust. Because risk management is an important part of the financial industry, effectiveness is vital to increase project success. These seven factors can increase the effectiveness of risk <b>management</b> <b>procedures</b> from the perspective of the financial industry in Thailand...|$|R

The MKB is generated by AACS LA, and allows all compliant devices, each using their set of secret Device Keys, to calculate the same Media Key (Km).If a set of Device Keys is compromised in a way that threatens the integrity of the system, an updated MKB can be released that causes a device with the compromised set of Device Keys to be unable to calculate the correct Km. In this way, the compromised Device Keys are “revoked” by the new MKB.|$|E
