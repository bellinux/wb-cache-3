Silk clothes found in Han tombs include padded robes, {{double-layered}} robes, single-layered robes, single-layered skirts, shoes, socks, and <b>mittens.</b> The wealthy also wore fox and badger furs, wild duck plumes, and slippers with inlaid leather or silk lining; those of more modest means could wear wool and ferret skins. Large bamboo-matted suitcases found in Han tombs contained clothes and luxury items such as patterned fabric and embroidery, common silk, damask and brocade, and the leno (or gauze) weave, all with rich colors and designs. The Han also had tools for ironing clothes.|$|E

25|$|Idiot <b>mittens</b> are two <b>mittens</b> {{connected}} by a length of yarn, string or lace, threaded through the sleeves of a coat.

25|$|Wrist-length <b>mittens</b> {{used to be}} {{commonly}} made of seal or caribou {{skin with}} the fur and the rough edge of the seam on the outside. Sealskin <b>mittens</b> were frequently made from leftover pieces of skin after boots were cut from them. The back and palm were separate pieces and the thumb one piece; gloves were unknown. Women wore fur <b>mittens</b> reaching nearly to the elbow with wolverine trim along the upper edge. <b>Mittens</b> of silver salmon skins which reached to the elbow were worn by men when hunting in a kayak in spring. The fish were cut down the back and the belly skins used for <b>mittens.</b> These sometimes were lined with grass or had grass <b>mittens,</b> woven all in one piece, inside; often they had a border of bleached sealskin. The combination of fish skin <b>mittens</b> with grass padding was less bulky for paddling than fur <b>mittens.</b> According to Curtis (1930, p.11), <b>mittens</b> of dehaired sealskin that reached barely to the wrist were also worn by men in the spring.|$|E
40|$|The Chinese <b>mitten</b> crab, Eriocheir sinensis, has {{a history}} of invasions in {{numerous}} countries. In 1992, the Chinese <b>mitten</b> crab was introduced to the San Francisco Bay/Delta system. Since its invasion in the San Francisco Bay, it has become an aquatic nuisance species. Little is known about the population dynamics of the megalopa stage of the Chinese <b>mitten</b> crab in the San Francisco Bay estuary, particularly the megalopa stage. Light traps are often used to sample marine larvae and can provide measures for relative abundance of larvae between sampling locations. As part of an ongoing study to monitor <b>mitten</b> crab larvae in the San Francisco Bay, light trap and plankton tow samples were analyzed for <b>mitten</b> crab megalopae and zoeae. In order to implement low cost sampling devices for <b>mitten</b> crab megalopae such as light traps, it is necessary to be able to identify their larvae in collected samples. Thus, the main objective of this work was to develop a means to distinguish <b>mitten</b> crab megalopae from other native and invasive brachyuran megalopae inhabiting the San Francisco Bay Estuary. The minimal amount of <b>mitten</b> crab megalopae found in light trap samples may be linked to the recent decline of <b>mitten</b> crab zoeae in San Pablo Bay...|$|R

25|$|A glove (Middle English from Old English glof) is {{a garment}} {{covering}} the whole hand. Gloves have separate sheaths or openings for each finger and the thumb; {{if there is}} an opening but no (or a short) covering sheath for each finger they are called fingerless gloves. Fingerless gloves having one large opening rather than individual openings for each finger are sometimes called gauntlets, though gauntlets are not necessarily fingerless. Gloves which cover the entire hand or fist but do not have separate finger openings or sheaths are called <b>mittens.</b> <b>Mittens</b> are warmer than other styles of gloves made of the same material because fingers maintain their warmth better when they are in contact with each other.

40|$|An {{integrated}} {{field and}} structural {{analysis of the}} <b>Mitten</b> Park fault-fold structure, northwestern Colorado and northeastern Utah, examines its structural origin. The <b>Mitten</b> Park structure is a modified fault-propagation-fold. This new model incorporates faulting, folding, and fracturing in one deformational event to produce the <b>Mitten</b> Park fault and associated monocline. The largest structure {{in the study area}} is the <b>Mitten</b> Park fault and associated monocline. The <b>Mitten</b> Park fault has approximately 127 meters (415 feet) of net slip, strikes S 28 °W and dips 55 °WNW. In the footwall, net shortening was accommodated by reverse and normal faulting. Faulting was the result of northwest-southeast directed shortening. Reverse faulting accommodated the majority of the fault-related strain along the fault 2 ̆ 7 s trace and resulted in net shortening. However, normal faults in the overturned limb of the footwall of the <b>Mitten</b> Park fault also accommodated northwest-southeast directed shortening. Folds in the study area are asymmetrical and statistically cylindrical in both the footwall and the hanging wall. Folding facilitates northwest-southeast directed shortening. There is a direct correlation between changes in the strike and dip of the fault plane and changes in the trend and plunge of fold axis in the footwall. Fracture orientations show no significant variation in geometry from hanging wall to footwall. Fracture intensity increases with proximity to the <b>Mitten</b> Park fault. Balanced cross sections of the <b>Mitten</b> Park area use a modified fault-propagation- fold model and are also constrained by field observations and interlimb angles of folds. Total shortening in the study area is 13. 5...|$|R
40|$|A non-ovigerous female <b>mitten</b> crab {{captured}} in Iraq on the 20 th June 2005 was initially identified as Eriocheir sinensis H. Milne Edwards, 1853.

From this morphological study the Persian Gulf material was identified as the Hepu <b>mitten</b> crab, E. hepuensis. This is the first report of this <b>mitten</b> crab species outside its native range of southern China. However, because <b>mitten</b> crab taxonomy and systematics requires further clarification especially with respect to species of Eriocheir De Haan, 1835, the DNA of the Persian Gulf material was compared with a suite of GenBank COI sequences from various <b>mitten</b> crab taxa.

Also reported, and of concern, is that E. hepuensis may have been first collected about thirty years ago in Iraq and has now become well established within that country.
