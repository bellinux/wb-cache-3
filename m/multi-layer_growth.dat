40|$|Abstractδ-Catenin binds the juxtamembrane {{domain of}} E-cadherin {{and is known}} to be overexpressed in some human tumors. However, the {{functions}} of δ-catenin in epithelial cells and carcinomas remain elusive. We found that prostate cancer cells overexpressing δ-catenin show an increase in <b>multi-layer</b> <b>growth</b> in culture. In these cells, δ-catenin colocalizes with E-cadherin at the plasma membrane, and the E-cadherin processing is noticeably elevated. E-Cadherin processing induced by δ-catenin is serum-dependent and requires MMP- and PS- 1 /γ-secretase-mediated activities. A deletion mutant of δ-catenin that deprives the ability of δ-catenin to bind E-cadherin or to recruit PS- 1 to E-cadherin totally abolishes the δ-catenin-induced E-cadherin processing and the <b>multi-layer</b> <b>growth</b> of the cells. In addition, prostate cancer cells overexpressing δ-catenin display an elevated total β-catenin level and increase its nuclear distribution, resulting in the activation of β-catenin/LEF- 1 -mediated transcription and their downstream target genes as well as androgen receptor-mediated transcription. Indeed, human prostate tumor xenograft in nude mice, which is derived from cells overexpressing δ-catenin, shows increased β-catenin nuclear localization and more rapid growth rates. Moreover, the metastatic xenograft tumor weights positively correlate with the level of 29 kD E-cadherin fragment, and primary human prostate tumor tissues also show elevated levels of δ-catenin expression and the E-cadherin processing. Taken together, these results suggest that δ-catenin {{plays an important role in}} prostate cancer progression through inducing E-cadherin processing and thereby activating β-catenin-mediated oncogenic signals...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} {{the initial stages of}} {{strained}} SiGe alloy growth on the Si(001) -(2 × 1) surface by scanning tunneling microscopy. The Si 0. 36 Ge 0. 64 alloy was grown on the silicon substrate at various coverages (0. 13 - 3. 6 ML) and at different temperatures (∼ 310 - 470 °C). The growth was one dimensional, preferring the direction perpendicular to the underlying silicon dimer rows at low coverages and low temperatures.

40|$|A {{stochastic}} atomic-scale lattice-based numerical method {{based on}} the Exact Lattice First Passage Time method was developed for the simulation of {{the early stages of}} kinetically controlled electrochemical nucleation and growth. Electrochemical reaction and surface diffusion on a hexagonal lattice was accounted for in a pristine physical model system that included edge diffusion along steps, and movement over step edges with Ehrlich-Schwöbel barrier. Five cases were investigated: homoexpitaxy, heteroepitaxy, <b>multi-layer</b> <b>growth,</b> terraces, and confined regions. For each, the influence of the physical parameters, deposition conditions, and system geometry on growth morphology was investigated. Simulation based studies of multilayer surface morphology were able to distinguish between layer-by-layer and island growth modes. On stepped terraces, parameter regions associated with he surface diffusion to deposition flux ratio (D/F) and the Ehrlich-Schwöbel barrier were identified under which deposition occurred either at the step edge or by nucleation and growth of islands on the terraces. The probability of growing single crystals in a small confined region was found to scale with D/F and the radius squared. © 2014 The Electrochemical Society...|$|E

Briefly, male Sprague–Dawley rats (8 – 12  weeks old) were euthanized by inhalation of CO 2. Incisions were made on both lower limbs to expose the tibiae and femora. Both bones {{were removed from the}} hind limbs and placed in ice cold sterile Tyrode’s solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The marrow was then flushed into a dish containing MSC complete culture medium (MEM-α Media (Gibco, Paisley, UK), F 12 -Ham Media (Gibco), 10  % fetal bovine serum (PAA, Somerset, UK), and 1  % antibiotic/antimycotic (Sigma) and dispersed into a cell suspension. After centrifugation and filtration through a 100 -μm nylon mesh, a cell count was performed and the cells were transferred to a 175 -cm 2 flasks containing 30  ml of MSC complete medium, at a density of 9 [*]×[*] 105 cells/cm 2. On day 3 of culture in an atmosphere of 5  % CO 2 / 90  % humidity at 37  °C, medium and non-adherent cells were removed and fresh medium was added to each flask.

In Yb 3 +-activated micro-structured channel waveguides, we demonstrated lasers with 418 mW of continuous-wave output power at 1023 nm and a slope efficiency of 71 % versus launched pump power at 981 nm. Channel waveguide lasers operating on the 981 -nm zero-phonon line were demonstrated under pumping at 934 nm with an output power of 650 mW and a slope efficiency of 76 % versus absorbed pump power. Lasing with a record-low quantum defect of 0. 7 % was achieved. In a feasibility study, a device comprising a tapered active channel waveguide and a passive planar pump waveguide, fabricated by <b>multi-layer</b> <b>growth</b> of lattice-matched layers, was demonstrated as a laser by diode-side pumping with a high-power, multi-mode diode bar. This approach offers the potential for significantly increased output powers from channel waveguide lasers. Tm 3 +-activated channel waveguide lasers demonstrated a {{maximum output power of}} 300 mW and slope efficiency of 70 %, when pumping near 800 nm. Lasing was obtained at various wavelengths between 1810 nm and 2037 nm. These lasers were operated with resonators exploiting either butt-coupled mirrors, providing only a non-permanent solution, or based on Fresnel reflection at the waveguide end-facets, resulting in laser emission from both waveguide ends and without control of the laser wavelength.

40|$|Scanning Laser Epitaxy (SLE) {{is a new}} layer-by-layer {{additive}} manufacturing process being developed in the Direct Digital Manufacturing Laboratory at Georgia Tech. SLE allows for the fabrication of three-dimensional objects with specified microstructure through the controlled melting and re-solidification of a metal powder placed atop a base substrate. This dissertation discusses the work done to date on assessing the feasibility of using SLE to both repair single crystal (SX) turbine airfoils and manufacture functionally graded turbine components. Current processes such as selective laser melting (SLM) {{are not able to}} create structures with defined microstructure and often have issues with warping of underlying layers due to the high temperature gradients present when scanning a high power laser beam. Additionally, other methods of repair and buildup have typically been plagued by crack formation, equiaxed grains, stray grains, and grain multiplication that can occur when dendrite arms are separated from their main dendrites due to remelting. In this work, it is shown that the SLE process is capable of creating fully dense, crack-free equiaxed, directionally-solidified, and SX structures. The SLE process, though, is found to be currently constrained by the cumbersome method of choosing proper parameters and a relative lack of repeatability. Therefore, it is hypothesized that a real-time feedback control scheme based upon a robust offline model will be necessary both to create specified defect-free microstructures and to improve the repeatability of the process enough to allow for <b>multi-layer</b> <b>growth.</b> The proposed control schemes are based upon temperature data feedback provided at high frame rate by a thermal imaging camera. This data is used in both PID and model reference adaptive control (MRAC) schemes and drives the melt pool temperature during processing towards a reference melt pool temperature that has been found to give a desired microstructure in the robust offline model of the process. The real-time control schemes will enable the ground breaking capabilities of the SLE process to create engine-ready net shape turbine components from raw powder material. Ph. D...|$|E
40|$|Fundamental-mode channel {{waveguide}} lasers, {{while offering}} high pump and signal intensities and excellent pump-signal mode overlap, usually require a fundamental-mode pump source, thus limiting the diode pump power {{that can be}} launched into the waveguide to typically less than 1 W, thereby also setting limitations on the achievable output power. Here we demonstrate laser emission from a highly Yb 3 +-doped, tapered channel waveguide in KGdxLu 1 -x(WO 4) 2 by diode side pumping with a high-power, multi-mode diode bar via a passive planar waveguide, offering the potential for significantly increased output powers. We have chosen KGdxLu 1 -x(WO 4) 2 :Yb 3 + for its large pump-absorption cross-section at 981 nm. <b>Multi-layer</b> <b>growth</b> of lattice-matched layers [1] with various compositions is applied to design the refractive-index contrast and active properties of the laser device (Fig. 1). A 1. 7 to 0. 6 -µm-high, horizontally tapered waveguide structure is etched into the 5 mm-long KGd 0. 447 Lu 0. 078 Yb 0. 475 (WO 4) 2 active layer [2] to allow for efficient pump absorption under side pumping in its 50 -µm-wide waveguide section and simultaneously ensure single-mode laser emission via its 5 -µm-narrow waveguide section. The pump power is delivered from the side through a 5 to 2. 5 -µm-high passive KGd 0. 114 Lu 0. 116 Y 0. 77 (WO 4) 2 slab waveguide overgrown and surrounding the active tapered waveguide. The multi-mode, 30 -W diode bar is mounted on a water-cooled chuck without active temperature control, resulting in a pump wavelength around 980 nm (Fig. 2 a). The pump beam is modulated by a chopper with 2. 9 % duty cycle to reduce the thermal load. Mirrors are butt-coupled to the waveguide endfacets by use of a fluorinated oil, with reflection at 1040 nm of 99. 8 % and 90 % at the wide and narrow active-waveguide end, respectively. No additional measures are taken to cool the sample. With this first, non-optimized device a {{maximum output power of}} 10 mW (Fig. 2 a) when pumped with a cold diode (operating close to the absorption peak) and laser wavelength of 1038 nm (Fig. 2 b) are detected.

40|$|The {{production}} of light alkenes comprises a 250 million ton per year industry {{due to their}} extensive use in the {{production of}} plastics, rubbers, fuel blending agents, and chemical intermediates. While steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of petroleum crude oils are the most common methods for obtaining light alkenes, rising oil prices and low selectivities toward specific alkenes have driven the search for a more economical and efficient process. Catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes, obtained from natural gas feedstock, presents an attractive alternative that offers high selectivity and greater flexibility in the alkene pool to address changing demands. Platinum is the most effective metal to catalyze the reaction, but by itself, suffers from catalyst deactivation due to the buildup of carbonaceous deposits. The addition of a secondary metal to form a bimetallic alloy has been of high interest due to its ability to suppress coking and increase selectivity. This dissertation has focused on developing a deeper understanding of promotion effects of various metals and elucidating the mechanism behind coking on Pt catalysts. The use of Sn as a promoter was first investigated, and the effects of particle size and composition on the ethane dehydrogenation performance were determined using a colloidal method to prepare model catalysts. At high conversions, catalyst deactivation from coke formation was a strong function of particle size and Sn/Pt, in agreement with previous high resolution transmission electron microscopy studies (HRTEM) studies. Deactivation decreased significantly with decreasing particle size and increasing addition of Sn. For a fixed average particle size, the activity and selectivity to ethene increased with increasing content of Sn in the Pt-Sn particle. For Pt and Pt 3 Sn compositions, the turnover frequency increased with increasing particle size, while the selectivity to ethene was not strongly affected. 	For uncovering the mechanism by which Pt catalysts deactivate, carbon formation on MgO-supported Pt nanoparticles was studied by in situ HRTEM in order to obtain time-resolved images of a single nanoparticle during the dynamic coking process. An electron dose rate dependence on the rate of carbon growth was found, and a suitable imaging strategy was adopted in order to minimize beam-induced artifacts. <b>Multi-layer</b> carbon <b>growth</b> around the nanoparticle was investigated, and significant restructuring of the particle was also observed. In particular, step formation was captured in various images, supporting evidence that the nucleation and growth of carbon during coking on Pt catalysts often requires low coordination sites such as step sites. This is in agreement with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments, which illustrate a slight preference for carbon atoms to nucleate at the step sites on a Pt(111) crystal. Other promoters for light alkane dehydrogenation were then investigated. The thermal dehydrogenation of n-butane to butene and hydrogen was carried out over Pt nanoparticles supported on calcined hydrotalcite containing indium, Mg(In) (Al) O. The optimal In/Pt ratio was found to be between 0. 33 and 0. 88, yielding > 95 % selectivity to butenes. Hydrogen co-fed with butane was shown to suppress coke formation and catalyst deactivation, with a ratio of H 2 /C 4 H 10 = 2. 5 providing the best catalytic performance. In addition, a Pt-Ir alloy was investigated for ethane and propane dehydrogenation. Following characterization to confirm formation of a bimetallic alloy, intrinsic rate measurements at low feed residence time revealed the following trend in activity: Pt 3 Sn > Pt 3 Ir > Pt. DFT calculations carried out on tetrahedral clusters (Pt 4, Pt 3 Ir, Pt 3 Sn) show that this trend in activity can be attributed to variations in the HOMO-LUMO gap of the cluster...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{industrial}} gas turbines {{to operate at}} higher temperatures and/or speeds {{has resulted in the}} continual modification of nickel-based superalloys to provide better high-temperature strength and corrosion resistance for components such as hot-section turbine blades. Thermal-Mechanical Fatigue (TMF) cracking, accelerated by the oxidation that forms {{as a result of the}} exposure of bare metal during the crack-opening stages, is one of the most common forms of damage experienced by service-run turbine blades. Due to the high costs associated with manufacturing nickel-based superalloy components, damaged turbine blades must be repaired to restore their original mechanical properties. One such method, Activated Diffusion Brazing (ADB), is under development for this purpose, and involves melting a two-part powder mixture into a damaged region. However, the tenacious oxides formed on nickel-based superalloy components provide an obstacle for the repair process, and must be removed. Fluoride-Ion Cleaning (FIC) uses flowing hydrogen and HF gas to remove tenacious oxide scales through a set of chemical reactions, leaving cleaned components free of oxide compounds and depleted of the strong oxide-formers of Al and Ti. GTD 111 is a nickel-based superalloy containing the strong oxidizing elements of Al, Ti, and Cr, and is similar in composition to other nickel-based superalloys such as DD 8 and Rene 95. Literature concerning the oxidation, cleaning, and brazing of this particular alloy is limited, and as such this thesis serves as a comprehensive overview of the chemical effects of each above process on GTD 111. The objectives of this project are to determine, through SEM-EDX and element mapping analysis, the oxidation behavior of nickel-based superalloy GTD 111, the effects of oxidation and FIC on the chemistry near the surface of this particular alloy, and the effects of mixing ratio and paste viscosity on the quality of repairs made by ADB. Notches of 8 mm depth and 0. 25 mm width were made in coupons of GTD 111 via wire-EDM and samples were oxidized between 1 and 452 hours at 900 °C. Samples oxidized between 96 and 452 hours were sectioned in half and one half of each sample was cleaned via the standard FIC process at Ti-Coating Inc. Notches of 8 mm depth and 1 mm width, also made via wire-EDM, were repaired by the ADB process with a bonding temperature of 1220 °C and a holding time of 65 minutes. Time-dependent <b>multi-layer</b> oxide <b>growth</b> was observed on all samples, consisting of an innermost discontinuous aluminum oxide region, followed by a thin continuous band of Ni-W-Ta oxide and a thicker, very dense chromium oxide layer. Some oxidation times exhibited the presence of weak, inconsistent oxide regions rich in Ni and/or Ti. Since the GTD 111 alloy does not contain sufficient amount of Al to form a continuous layer – as 5 - 7 % Al is required – oxidation resistance was provided mainly by the formation of the dense chromium oxide layer. A region heavily depleted of Al and Ti and therefore the strengthening gamma prime phase was observed below and surrounding the Al-rich oxide regions. Chemical analysis of cleaned samples showed that the standard FIC process at Ti-Coating Inc. was able to remove all oxide compounds formed during oxidation at 900 °C, and that the prior oxidation time had no effect on the chemistry within the surface of the cleaned samples; however, the depths of elemental and gamma prime phase depletion were affected. The elemental depletions of Al and Ti have been observed in past studies, but depletions of Ni and concentrations of Cr near the surfaces of cleaned components have not been previously observed. Preliminary brazing trials made with varying paste viscosities demonstrated the importance of paste pre-placement and maintaining the molten filler metal within the notch, as better pre-placement resulted in higher densities in the braze-repaired region of the brazing trial samples. Although porosity was observed on all samples, the paste pre-placement was found to be more important in reducing porosity than the mixing ratio and paste viscosity, although using an appropriate paste viscosity allowed for better pre-placement...|$|R
