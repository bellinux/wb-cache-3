For this study 75 natural cork stoppers were used and divided equally in 3 groups: (i) stoppers of superior class; (ii) stoppers of inferior class to be colmated; (iii) colmated stoppers. Image analysis techniques were applied on the surfaces of superior and inferior (pre-colmated) class of stoppers, to analyze their porosity. Porosity features showed differences between two classes: higher values of all features in the inferior class and lower in the superior quality class. Water absorption test performed on colmated and pre-colmated group of stoppers showed small differences between them: colmated stoppers absorbed less water (92. 1 %) than pre-colmated class (98. 8 %) and the same trend was found with dimensional variations (swelling) (lower swelling of colmated stoppers was reported). The behavior of the colmated and pre-colmated stoppers under compression performed in axial and radial direction was studied. Young’s modulus for compression in axial direction were 21. 2 MPa and 18. 4 MPa for colmated and pre-colmated group respectively, while the compression in radial direction was characterized with the range of force for the given deformation, with <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> of 147 <b>kN</b> and 135 kN for 1 mm deformation.

Limited knowledge is available on doses received indirectly by organs, during diagnostic procedures. In the present study, the radiation dose to the lens of the eyes was measured from various Computerized Axial Tomography protocols for head and trunk imaging. Thermoluminescence dosimeters were used to measure organ doses in an anthropomorphic Rando Alderson phantom. The unwanted (non-useful) radiation doses delivered to the eye lens during Computerized Axial To-mography examination of head, facial bone, orbits, abdomen, chest, pelvis, neck, nasopharynx, cervical spine, lumbar spine, and sacroiliac joint were as-sessed. The following results are obtained: head scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 8. 74 mGy; facial bone scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 8. 03 mGy; orbital scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 61. 51 mGy; abdomen scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 0. 76 mGy; chest scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 1. 03 mGy; pelvis scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 0. 46 mGy; neck scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 1. 81 mGy; nasopharynx scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 8. 56 mGy; cervical spine scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 6. 15 mGy; lumber spine scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 0. 46 mGy; and sacroiliac joint scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 0. 35 mGy.

40|$|Abstract. The {{extended}} <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> E(r, s;x, y) play {{an important}} role in theory of <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> and theory of inequalities, and even in the whole math-ematics, since many norms in mathematics are always means. Its study is not only interesting but important, both because most of the two-variable <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> are special cases of E(r, s;x, y), and because it is challenging to study a function whose formulation is so indeterminate. In this expositive article, we summarize the recent main results about study of E(r, s;x, y), including definition, basic properties, monotonicities, compar-ison, logarithmic convexities, Schur-convexities, generalizations of concepts of <b>mean</b> <b>values,</b> applications to quantum, to theory of special functions, to es-tablishment of Steffensen pairs, and to generalization of Hermite-Hadamard’s inequality. 1. Definition and expressions of the extended <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> The histories of <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> and inequalities are long [9]. The <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> are related to the <b>Mean</b> <b>Value</b> Theorems for derivative or for integral, which are the bridge between the local and global properties of functions. The arithmetic-mean-geometric-mean inequality is probably the most important inequality, and certainly a keystone of the theory of inequalities [2]. Inequalities of <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> are one of the main parts of theory of inequalities, they have explicit geometric meanings [14]. The theory of <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> plays an important role in the whole mathematics, since many norms in mathematics are always means. 1. 1. Definition of the extended <b>mean</b> <b>values.</b> In 1975, the extended <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> E(r, s;x, y) were defined in [51] by K. B. Stolarsky as follows E(r, s;x, y) =...|$|R
