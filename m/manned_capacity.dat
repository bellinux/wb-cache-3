40|$|An {{objective}} {{was to determine if}} the pressurized elements and hatchways of the Space Station Freedom support the emergency egress of crewmembers during operation of the station at the stage of Permanently <b>Manned</b> <b>Capacity.</b> Emergency egress was defined as the exit from a pressurized element when an event occurs which makes that element uninhabitable. The possible egress paths for four emergency scenarios considered were: (1) accident occurs in a module and crewmembers translate to the attached node; (2) accident occurs at a node and crewmembers translate through it to the safe node; (3) accident occurs at a module close to a node and crewmembers are not able to translate through the affected area; and (4) accident occurs at a node and crewmembers cannot translate through it. The structural design of the pressurized elements and the hatches studied is adequate for the emergence egress translation requirement. The current location of a few racks may cause some obstruction for egress to the orbiter. The egress time required in the worst situation is estimated to be about 3 mins. There is a chance of getting crewmembers trapped in a module in case of a severe accident. Aids are needed for emergency egress translation...|$|E

The 27A had an air-cooled four-cylinder Wisconsin engine with magneto ignition and a Zenith carburetor that developed 22 horesepower. The 27AW-F and 38B-F had a water-cooled four-cylinder Ford engine that developed 40 hp. Other products in 1960 that ran on the rails included a power tamping jack, a ballast equalizer with plow and sweeper, a spike driver and a line of trailers and push carts. Track gauges and levels, plus portable setoff assembly and take off rails rounded out the catalog.|$|R

The technology readiness of this concept was demonstrated by characterizing the performance of this one man system over wide ranges in cabin atmospheric conditions. The electrochemical air revitalization system consists of a water vapor electrolysis module to generate oxygen from water vapor in the cabin air, and an electrochemical depolarized carbon dioxide concentrator module to remove carbon dioxide from the cabin air. A control/monitor instrumentation package that uses the electrochemical depolarized concentrator module power generated to partially offset the water vapor electrolysis module power requirements and various structural fluid routing components are also part of the system. The system was designed to meet the one man metabolic oxygen generation and carbon dioxide removal requirements, thereby controlling cabin partial pressure of oxygen at 22 kN/sq m and cabin pressure of carbon dioxide at 400 N/sq m over a wide range in cabin air relative humidity conditions...|$|R

40|$|Regent Household Empowerment (RHE) Project aims at {{assisting}} Regent {{residents to}} establish and operate their own Cooperative Society {{by the end of}} the year 2006. The target community is Regent neighbourhood, comprising of Ursino and Regent Estates, which is located in Mikocheni A area, Kinondoni District. Presently, Regent residents have been experiencing a number of problems among the major ones being inability to access credit finance to meet their capital requirements. The goal of the project therefore is to contribute to the empowerment of Regent Residents socially and economically, to enable them attain their own economic development. The Host organization is Ursino Women Association (UWA), a CBO already operating in the neighbourhood. So far UWA, whose members are all women, is operating as a self-help organization, promoting social services and networking among the local women. Eligible members to the envisaged cooperative venture are all residents (women and <b>men).</b> <b>Capacity</b> building programs were conducted and founder members admitted. The SACCOS was registered on 25 th July 2006, then having admitted 134 founder members. Resources to sustain the operations of the project and the ultimate Cooperative Society, registered in the name of "Ursino & Regent SACCOS Limited", have to a large extent been generated from within the community in the form of members' physical participation and capital/material contributions. By 31 st December 2006, the formal operations of the SACCOs were yet to be commissioned. However, evaluation of the project, as at 31 st December 2006, shows that the objectives of the project have to a large extent been attained. (Author abstract) Bupamba, C. K. (2007).
