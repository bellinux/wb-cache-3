5|$|Although both Pi Vell and Pi Jove are officially protected, {{they are}} easily {{accessible}} {{in an isolated}} wooded area, and therefore vulnerable to vandalism as well as natural hazards such as lightning and wildfire.

5|$|The Germans {{attempted}} {{to build on}} their success against Convoy Faith by carrying out further medium-altitude attacks on convoys. III./KG 40 sank another four ships between July and September 1943, but suffered heavy losses from Allied aircraft and anti-aircraft guns. From October, Heinkel He177s largely took over the Condors' anti-shipping role, and the last Condor sorties were <b>made</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic in early 1944.|$|E
5|$|Work on Valperga's {{modifications}} to the lines progressed slowly, and {{by the beginning of}} the 18th century the outworks, glacis and enceinte facing Marsamxett were still unfinished. Works continued under a number of other engineers, including Charles François de Mondion, and the lines were largely complete when Porte des Bombes was constructed in 1721. Further alterations were <b>made</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> following decades, such as the construction of the Northern Entrenchment in the 1730s.|$|E

5|$|Alex Funke, {{who worked}} on The Lord of the Rings, {{directed}} the film's miniatures unit. These include 1/24th and 1/100th scale miniatures of Miraz's castle. A scale model was built of the Narnians' cave hideouts during the climactic battle, which the actor playing the giant Wimbleweather was filmed against. One of the improvements <b>made</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> previous film {{was to make the}} centaurs walk during dialogue scenes, so Cornell John as Glenstorm wore Power Risers (mechanical stilts with springs), to mimic a horse's canter and height. The animatronic Minotaur heads were also improved to properly lip sync, although this was not as successful as hoped and had to be revamped digitally.|$|E
5|$|Although many false {{claims of}} its {{discovery}} were <b>made</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years, the element was first synthesized by Edwin McMillan and Philip H. Abelson at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory in 1940. Since then, most neptunium {{has been and}} still is produced by neutron irradiation of uranium in nuclear reactors. The vast majority is generated as a by-product in conventional nuclear power reactors. While neptunium itself has no commercial uses at present, it {{is used as a}} precursor for the formation of plutonium-238, used in radioisotope thermal generators to provide electricity for spacecraft. Neptunium has also been used in detectors of high-energy neutrons.|$|E
5|$|Bad weather {{resulted}} in a decline of anti-shipping operations, and before long the Ju 87 groups began re-deploying to Poland, {{as part of the}} concealed build-up for Operation Barbarossa. By spring 1941, only St.G 1 with 30 Ju 87s remained facing the United Kingdom. Operations on a small scale continued throughout the winter months into March. Targets included ships at sea, the Thames Estuary, the Chatham naval dockyard and Dover and night-bomber sorties <b>made</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Channel. These attacks were resumed the following winter.|$|E

5|$|Further {{additions}} to the interior were <b>made</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> next quarter-century. A new Gothic altar, produced in Düsseldorf, Germany, was installed in 1880. Two years later a communion bench was installed. The tower was also given a clock and bells during this period; the clock was removed in 1978 since the machinery was broken. Lijden died in 1882, and the Jesuit Joannes de Vries became the parish priest, the first in an unbroken line of Jesuit pastors which continues until the present day. De Vries was soon after elected provincial superior for the province, and thus {{he spent much of}} his time away from the church. By 1885 there were 1,620 Catholics in Semarang, up from approximately a thousand four years earlier. Many of these were in the colonial military.|$|E
5|$|Initially ordered as Panzerschiffe, {{the three}} Deutschland-class ships were {{designed}} to meet the limitations imposed on the German Navy by the Treaty of Versailles. The treaty limited large German warships to a displacement of , but did not restrict the caliber of main battery guns. Several innovations were incorporated into the design, including extensive use of welding and all-diesel propulsion, which saved weight and allowed for the heavier main armament and armor. Nevertheless, the ships exceeded the weight restriction by several thousand tons, though the German Navy claimed the vessels were within the limitations. The three ships, Deutschland, Admiral Scheer, and Admiral Graf Spee, were built between 1929 and 1936. Design changes were <b>made</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> course of the construction program, resulting in slightly differing characteristics of each ship.|$|E
5|$|Johnston's {{connections}} with the University of Washington (where he had carried out his masters and doctoral research) are remembered by a memorial fund that established an endowed graduate-level fellowship within {{what is now the}} department of Earth and Space Sciences.

Isaac's commissions had been purchased with a loan entered into the bank's books by his brother, and the Brocks faced a demand for payment. Isaac could not meet the £3000 debt, but <b>made</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> whole of his salary to his brother Irving, to be used for whatever was considered most critical: his commission debt or the family's other bills.|$|E
5|$|MiG-3s were {{delivered}} to frontline fighter regiments {{beginning in the}} spring of 1941 and were a handful for pilots accustomed to the lower-performance and docile Polikarpov I-152 and I-153 biplanes and the Polikarpov I-16 monoplane. It remained tricky and demanding to fly even after the extensive improvements <b>made</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> MiG-1. Many fighter regiments had not kept pace in training pilots to handle the MiG and the rapid pace of deliveries resulted in many units having more MiGs than trained pilots during the German invasion. By 1 June 1941, 1,029 MIG-3s were on strength, but there were only 494 trained pilots.|$|E
5|$|Several {{developments}} were <b>made</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> following years, {{including the}} introduction of co-educational units of boys and girls, initially restricted to the Venture Scouts section in 1976, but from 1991 junior sections were allowed to become mixed as well. Parents involved with the association in Northern Ireland also began to organise activities for their children who were too young for Cub Scouts. Originally, only {{the leaders of the}} new section, nicknamed Beavers, were members of the association with the youths themselves becoming Scouts officially in 1986. In the late 1990s, a Muslim Scout Fellowship was formed, which by the end of 2007, had assisted the establishment of 13 Muslim Scout Groups in England and Wales.|$|E

5|$|The Antarctic scallop {{was first}} {{described}} by the British zoologist Edgar Albert Smith in 1902 as Pecten colbecki. He worked at the British Museum and was responsible for examining and describing shells from collections <b>made</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years that had been deposited there. The German malacologist Johannes Thiele determined in 1934 that {{the characteristics of the}} Antarctic scallop were sufficiently different from those of other members of the genus Pecten to warrant its inclusion in a separate genus, Adamussium. More recently, examinations of the chromosome structure and of the mitochondrial DNA of A. colbecki have been undertaken, but the exact phylogenetic relationship it has with other pectinids is still unclear.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{target for}} the bomb was the city of Kokura, but it {{was found to be}} obscured by clouds and drifting smoke from fires started by a major firebombing raid by 224 B-29s on nearby Yahata the previous day. This covered 70% of the area over Kokura, obscuring the aiming point. Three bomb runs were <b>made</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> next 50 minutes, burning fuel and repeatedly exposing the aircraft to the heavy defenses of Yawata, but the bombardier was unable to drop visually. By the time of the third bomb run, Japanese anti-aircraft fire was getting close, and Second Lieutenant Jacob Beser, who was monitoring Japanese communications, reported activity on the Japanese fighter direction radio bands.|$|E
