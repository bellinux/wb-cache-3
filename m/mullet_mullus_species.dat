40|$|The Planning Group on Commercial Catch, Discards and Biological Sampling (PGCCDBS) and the Planning Group of Mediterranean (PGMED) {{meetings}} in 2011 (ICES, 2011 a) recommended an otoliths and scales exchange for <b>Mullus</b> <b>species</b> from Atlantic and Mediterranean sea. Workshop on Age reading red <b>mullet</b> (<b>Mullus</b> barbatus) and striped red <b>mullet</b> (<b>Mullus</b> surmuletus) (WKACM 2, chair : K. Mahé, France) {{has been held}} in Boulogne sur Mer (France) from 2 to 6 July 2012. Five countries took part in this exchange (Spain, Greece, Cyprus, Italy, France, {{for a total of}} 8 partici-pants) during 2011, and 3 countries (Spain, Italy, France: 6 participants) {{have been involved in the}} workshop. Results of this exchange showed important problems between readers (Mahé et al., 2012). The aim of this workshop was to review the results of the exchange 2011 and compare them with those of the previous workshop, to review validation methods on these species, to clarify the interpretation of annual rings, to continue a reference col-lection of well defined otoliths and to improve the recommendations. This report presented a review of age validation studies and state-of-the-art on age-ing the two <b>Mullus</b> <b>species.</b> After the presentation of readings results (mean agree-ment percentage from 50. 5 % to 74. 8 %; mean CV from 29. 7 % to 61. 7 %) and the precision of age estimation, the participants identified the sources of bias in the interpretation of the Mullus age. In both species, the position of the first growth ring on the otolith was identified as most important problem especially for Mediterranean area. Regarding the age from scales and otoliths, the choice of calcified piece influenced the results. The participants agreed in indicating the otoliths as the best calci-fied structure to ageing <b>Mullus</b> <b>species.</b> After discussion, second reading was made with the new scheme. The precision increased specially for M. barbatus in the Mediterranean sea (mean agreement percentage from 58. 7 % to 76. 5 %; mean CV from 37. 3 % to 16. 7 %). Moreover, there were some advances on the guideline of age reading during this workshop but it could be necessary to continue to clarify this guideline especially in the Mediterranean sea for both species. In consequence, the participants of WKACM 2 recommended study on validation methods for Mullus spp. ageing from otolith interpretation and also they indicated the proposals. Moreover, in 2014, new otoliths exchange will be organize. In 2015, the new workshop (WKCAM 3; Palma de Mallorca; co–chairs : F. Ordines, Spain; K. Mahé, France) will focus on the analysis of exchange results, validation studies and formalized guideline of ageing for Mullus surmuletus and M. barbatus...|$|R

Twenty putative enzyme-coding loci were examined in eight M. barbatus samples caught in the Aegean and Ionian Seas (Greece) and in the Gulf of Lion (France), and two M. surmuletus samples caught in the Aegean and Gulf of Lion. A high degree of genetic polymorphism was found in both species. Species-specific electrophoretic patterns were found in PGI* and PGM*. Estimates of variance of allele frequencies among samples (F-ST) and chi(2) analyses both revealed significant differences (P < 0. 05) among the hi. barbatus samples. Mast of the genetic variation was among samples regardless of region. The mean value of Nei's genetic distance between the two species was 0. 329. Genetic distance among M. barbatus samples was low (maximum Nei's D = 0. 012), with the sample from Platania differing most from other M. barbatus samples. This is probably be due to founder effects existing at this area.

This workshop (Co-chairs: Kélig Mahé, France; Pierluigi Carbonara, It-aly and Chryssi Mytilineou, Greece) {{has been held}} in Conversano (Italy) from 15 to 18 May 2017. Five countries took part in this meeting (Italy, Spain, Greece, France, Croa-tia) {{for a total of}} 16 participants. This meeting was organized to try to clarify the rules which are applied on the ageing of <b>mullet</b> <b>species</b> (<b>Mullus</b> surmuletus and M. barbatus). At the beginning of the workshop, a lot of presentations were discussed focusing on the used ageing methodologies by each institute and all ageing validation studies. A synthesis of validation methods was conducted during the workshop aiming to iden-tify a) the first false ring coinciding with the demersal check formation for both species (for the fish around 5 cm of total length), b) the period with opaque edge in otoliths (from May to October) and c) the mean length at the first age groups derived from the length distribution analysis. Various schemes for the age interpretation are used by the readers. This is a source of bias in the readings. As a consequence, schemes for the age interpretation have been discussed. Two main age interpretation schemes were de-cided to be appliedon a set of 40 images. These otoliths had also been used in the 2011 exchange. The bias between the two age interpretation schemes was estimated. Ac-cording to this, the bias between readers was smaller for the scheme 1 (birthdate: 1 st January) than scheme 2 (birthdate: 1 st July). Differences in ageing were detected during the first semester. Moreover, these results showed the low agreement between readers for each interpretation scheme. Comparing the modal age obtained by each interpreta-tion scheme, a significant difference was observed. For stock assessment and manage-ment purposes, it would be desirable that all countries use the same age interpretation scheme. Based on several discussions on the age interpretation results of this exercise, a new age interpretation scheme was proposed during this workshop. The WKVALMU proposed recommendations for the next exchange which will be organ-ised in 2018. In 2019, the new workshop (WKCAM 3; Split; co-chairs: P. Carbonara, It-aly; K. Mahé, France; D. Medvesek, Croatia) will focus on the analysis of the new exchange results, validation studies and will formalise guidelines on the ageing of Mul-lus surmuletus and M. barbatus. During the present workshop, it was noted that the dif-ficulty and the low agreement in age interpretation makes necessary the development of a European project on age validation methods. Consequently, a draft proposal has started to be written during this workshop...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Red <b>mullet,</b> <b>Mullus</b> {{barbatus}} Linnaeus, 1758, is {{an economically}} very important species in trawl fisheries in the Adriatic Sea. Material for analysis was collected from October 2002 until May 2004 with a bottom trawl net from commercial trawlers on the Montenegrin shelf. Mortality {{of this species}} was analyzed {{for the first time}} in this area, separately for males and females and for both sexes together. Until now, only the spatial distribution and catch per unit of effort (CPUE) of Mullus barbatus have been studied in Montenegrin waters. Estimated total mortality rates were Z males = 0. 653 and Z females = 0. 712. The average mortality rate for both sexes was Z m+f = 0. 749, while the natural mortality rate was Mm+f = 0. 342. Values of Z in the Montenegrin shelf area are considerably lower than Z values for the Croatian and Italian parts of the Adriatic Sea, indicating that on the Montenegrin shelf fishing of this species is significantly less intensive than in other trawl-fishing areas of the Adriatic Sea...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} seven Mediterranean fish species, bogue (Boops boops), {{chub mackerel}} (Scomber japonicus collias), horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), Mediterranean hake (Merluccius mediterraneus), sardine (Sardine mediterraneus), striped <b>mullet</b> (<b>Mullus</b> barbatus) were assessed for quality changes during {{a week of}} ice storage. All fish were stored whole in ice. Fish tester readings of all fish species {{were found to be}} below 35 by the end of ice storage. The pH was not significantly changed (p> 0. 05), while thiobarbituric acid number (TBA) and formaldehyde (FA) content were significantly increased (p {{less than or equal to}} 0. 05) by the end of ice storage of all fish species. Sensory evaluation showed that better storage life was observed for bogue, sardine and striped mullet by using the European Community (EC) freshness grading scheme of raw fish and for bogue and Mediterranean hake by using sensory panel evaluation of cooked fish fillets. Mediterranean hake may require a different descriptive scheme than the current EC freshness grading scheme. (C) 1998 Canadian Institute of Food Science and Technology.
