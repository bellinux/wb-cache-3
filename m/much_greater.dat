5|$|Great Britains {{builders}} recognised {{a number}} of advantages of iron over the traditional wooden hull. Wood was becoming more expensive, while iron was getting cheaper. Iron hulls were not subject to dry rot or woodworm, and they were also lighter in weight and less bulky. The chief advantage of the iron hull was its <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> structural strength. The practical limit {{on the length of}} a wooden-hulled ship is about 300feet, after which hogging—the flexing of the hull as waves pass beneath it—becomes too great. Iron hulls are far less subject to hogging, so that the potential size of an iron-hulled ship is <b>much</b> <b>greater.</b> The ship's designers, led by Brunel, were initially cautious in the adaptation of their plans to iron hulled-technology. With each successive draft however, the ship grew ever larger and bolder in conception. By the fifth draft, the vessel had grown to 3,400tons, over 1,000tons larger than any ship then in existence.|$|E

5|$|A {{traditional}} {{thesis is}} that cavalry assumed a <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> {{importance in the}} 4th-century army than it enjoyed in the 2nd century.

It also enjoyed much higher status than in the 2nd century. At the same time, the infantry declined in efficiency and value in operations, leaving the cavalry as the effective arm. In fact, there is no good evidence to support this view, and plenty of evidence against it.|$|E

5|$|Compression of a {{white dwarf}} will {{increase}} the number of electrons in a given volume. Applying the Pauli exclusion principle, this will increase the kinetic energy of the electrons, thereby increasing the pressure.

Degenerate matter is relatively compressible; this means that the density of a high-mass white dwarf is <b>much</b> <b>greater</b> than that of a low-mass white dwarf and that the radius {{of a white}} dwarf decreases as its mass increases.|$|E
