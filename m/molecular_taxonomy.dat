40|$|Coral {{taxonomy}} {{has entered}} a historical phase where nomenclatorial uncertainty is rapidly increasing. The fundamental cause is mandatory adherence to historical monographs that lack essential information of all sorts, {{and also to}} type specimens, if they exist at all, that are commonly unrecognizable fragments or are uncharacteristic of the species they are believed to represent. Historical problems, including incorrect subsequent type species designations, also create uncertainty for many well-established genera. The advent of in[*]situ studies in the 1970 s revealed these issues; now molecular technology is again changing the taxonomic landscape. The competing methodologies involved must be seen in context {{if they are to}} avoid becoming an additional basis for continuing nomenclatorial instability. To prevent this happening, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) will need to focus on rules that consolidate well-established nomenclature and allow for the designation of new type specimens that are unambiguous, and which include both skeletal material and soft tissue for molecular study. Taxonomic and biogeographic findings have now become linked, with molecular methodologies providing the capacity to re-visit past taxonomic decisions, and to extend both taxonomy and biogeography into the realm of evolutionary theory. It is proposed that most species will ultimately be seen as operational taxonomic units that are human rather than natural constructs, which in consequence will always have fuzzy morphological, genetic, and distribution boundaries. The pathway ahead calls for the integration of morphological and <b>molecular</b> <b>taxonomies,</b> and for website delivery of information that crosses current discipline boundaries...|$|R

40|$|Deep-sea soft sediments from trench {{systems and}} depths {{in the northwestern}} Pacific Ocean ranging from less than 300 to 10 897 m in depth have been {{analyzed}} for three target genera of actinomycetes: Micromonospora, Rhodococcus, and Streptomyces. Only culturable strains, recovered at atmospheric pressure on selective isolation media, have been examined to date. Maximum recoveries of culturable bacteria were greater that 10 (7) /ml wet g sediment, but actinomycetes comprised {{a small proportion of}} this population (usually less than 1 %). The target actinomycetes were isolated at all depths except from the Mariana Trench sediments. Actinomycete colonies were defined initially on the basis of colony morphologies, and preliminary identification then was made by chemotaxonomic tests. Pyrolysis mass spectrometry (PyMS) of deep-sea mycolic acid-containing actinomycetes gave excellent correspondence with numerical (phenetic) taxonomic analyses and subsequently was adopted as a rapid procedure for assessing taxonomic diversity. PyMS analysis enabled several clusters of deep-sea rhodococci to be distinguished that are quite distinct from all type strains. 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis has revealed that several of these marine rhodococci have sequences that are very similar to certain terrestrial species of Rhodococcus and to Dietzia. There is evidence for the intrusion of terrestrial runoff into these deep trench systems, and the inconsistency of the phenotypic and <b>molecular</b> <b>taxonomies</b> may reflect recent speciation events in actinomycetes under the high-pressure conditions of the deep sea. The results of DNA-DNA pairing experiments point to the novelty of Rhodococcus strains recovered from hadal depths in the Izu Bonin Trench. Biotransformation studies of deep-sea bacteria have focused on nitrile compounds. Nitrile-metabolizing bacteria, closely related to rhodococci, have been isolated that grow well at low temperature, high salt concentrations, and high pressures, suggesting that they are of marine origin or have adapted to the deep-sea environment...|$|R

50|$|Since 1969, life {{on earth}} was {{classified}} into five kingdoms, as introduced by Robert Whittaker. Margulis became the most important supporter, as well as critic - while supporting parts, {{she was the first}} to recognize the limitations of Whittaker's classification of microbes. But later discoveries of new organisms, such as archaea, and emergence of <b>molecular</b> <b>taxonomy</b> challenged the concept. By the mid-2000s, most scientists began to agree that there are more than five kingdoms. Margulis became the most important defender of the five kingdom classification. She rejected the three-domain system introduced by Carl Woese in 1990, which gained wide acceptance. She introduced a modified classification by which all life forms, including the newly discovered, could be integrated into the classical five kingdoms. According to her the main problem, archaea, falls under the kingdom Prokaryotae alongside bacteria (in contrast to the three-domain system, which treats archaea as a higher taxon than kingdom, or the six-kingdom system, which holds that it is a separate kingdom). Her concept is given in detail in her book Five Kingdoms, written with Karlene V. Schwartz. It is mainly because of her that this five-kingdom system survives.|$|E

This group of algae and the molecular markers used in the zygnematophytes' molecular phylogeny will be presented in this thesis. Zygnematophytes have unicellular or multicellular forms and they generally occur in freshwater habitats. Desmids are useful as indicators of water quality and they are also used for scoring of conservation value. Therefore {{it is important to have}} the species well defined. The confusion in defining of desmid species was caused by often very variable morphology. Some authors had different opinions on the classifying of desmid species and theirs subunits. The combination of molecular phylogeny, electron microscopy and geometric morphometrics was used in revealing of (pseudo) cryptic species in the genera Micrasterias or Xanthidium.

40|$|Bacterial {{taxonomy}} {{based on}} phenotypic properties has encountered several problems: many organisms grow too poorly under laboratory conditions to be studied; the same phenotypic property often arises independently {{in more than}} one branch of a phylogenetic tree; and pheno-typic schemes sometimes become unwieldy. Thus, molecular approaches have found a niche in taxonomy. Measurement of DNA hybridization between strains is the single most definitive tool for defining a species. Data on sequences of DNA and amino acids can be used to infer phy-logeny. The molecular phylogenetic approach is most useful at levels ranging from kingdom to species. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms or variability in random polymerase chain reactions often differentiates strains. In the majority of cases, different molecular approaches tend to confirm established taxonomic schemes for bacteria.
