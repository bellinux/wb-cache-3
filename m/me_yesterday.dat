I got to choose the music, but this time around it was, like, I'd sit down and think: 'What {{happened}} to <b>me</b> <b>yesterday?</b> What happened to me today?' and just write. It was very therapeutic, in a way. And easy â€“ I was shocked at {{how easy it was}} to be honest about yourself and things that affect you. It is a dance record, but I wanted it to be serious. I wanted to talk about serious things, but do it in a not-so-serious way, with music that makes you want to get up and dance.|$|E
2500|$|Ramzi A., a French-Tunisian born in Nice, aged 21. He was suspected, {{of having}} [...] "participated in {{supplying}} the automatic pistol of the killer".

2500|$|By nominalizing the {{relative}} clause (e.g. converting it to a participial construction). Generally, no relative pronoun or complementizer is used. This occurs, for example, in reduced relative clauses in English (e.g. [...] "The man seen by <b>me</b> <b>yesterday</b> went home" [...] or [...] "The man {{planning to go}} home soon is my friend"). Formal German makes common use of such participial relative clauses, which can become extremely long. This is also the normal strategy in Turkish, which has sentences equivalent to [...] "I ate the potato of Hasan's giving to Sina" [...] (in place of [...] "I ate the potato that Hasan gave to Sina"). Note {{that this can be}} viewed as a situation in which the [...] "complementizer" [...] is attached to the verb of the embedded clause (e.g. in English, [...] "-ing" [...] or [...] "-ed" [...] {{can be viewed as a}} type of complementizer).|$|E
