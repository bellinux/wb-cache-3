40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} identity-based encryption (IBE) with master key-dependent chosenplaintext (mKDM-sID-CPA) security. These are IBE schemes that remain secure even after the adversary sees encryptions, under some initially selected identities, of functions of the <b>master</b> <b>secret</b> <b>key(s).</b> We then propose a generic construction of chosen-ciphertext secure key-dependent encryption (KDM-CCA) schemes in the public key setting starting from mKDM-sID-CPA secure IBE schemes. This is reminiscent to the celebrated work by Canetti, Halevi and Katz (Eurocrypt 2004) on the traditional key-oblivious setting. Previously only one generic construction of KDM-CCA secure public key schemes was known, due to Camenisch, Chandran and Shoup (Eurocrypt 2009), and it required non-interactive zero knowledge proofs (NIZKs). Our transformation shows that NIZKs are not intrinsic to KDM-CCA public key encryption. Additionally, {{we are able to}} instantiate our new concept under the Rank assumption on pairing groups and for affine functions of the <b>secret</b> <b>keys.</b> The scheme builds on previous work by Boneh, Halevi, Hamburg and Ostrovsky (Crypto 2008). Our concrete schemes are only able to provide security against a bounded number of encryption queries, which is enough in some practical scenarios. As a corollary we obtain a KDM-CCA secure public key encryption scheme, in the standard model, whose security reduction to a static assumption is independent of the number of challenge queries. As an independent contribution, we give new and better reductions between the Rank problem (previously named as Matrix DDH problem) and the Decisional Linear and the Decisional 3 -Party Diffie-Hellman problems. ...|$|R

40|$|Fog Computing, a {{technology}} that takes advantage of both the paradigms of Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things, has a great advantage in reducing the communication cost. Since its introduction, fog computing has {{found a lot of}} applications, including, for instance, connected vehicles, wireless sensors, smart cities and etc. One prominent problem in fog computing is how fine-grained access control can be imposed. Functional encryption, a new cryptographic primitive, is known to support fine-grained access control. However, when it comes to some new threats in the fog computing scenario, such as side channel attacks, functional encryption cannot maintain its security. Therefore, we need new cryptographic primitives that not only provide a way to securely share data with a fine-grained access control but also are able to resist those new threats. In this paper, we consider how to construct functional encryption schemes (FEs) adaptively secure in continual memory leakage model (CML), {{which is one of the}} strongest models that allows continuous leakage on both user and <b>master</b> <b>secret</b> <b>keys.</b> Besides providing privacy and fine-grained access control in fog computing, our scheme can also guarantee security against side channel attacks. More concretely, we propose a generic framework for constructing fully secure leakage-resilient FEs (LR-FEs) in the CML model results from leakage-resilient pair encoding, which is an extension of pair encoding presented in the recent work of Attrapadung. In this way, our framework simplifies the design and analysis of LR-FEs into the design and analysis of predicate encodings. Moreover, we discover new adaptively secure LR-FEs, including FE for regular languages, attribute-based encryption (ABE) for large universe and ABE with short ciphertext. Above all, leakage-resilient adaptively secure functional encryption schemes can equip fog computing with higher security and fine-grained access control.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{an idea of}} {{adopting}} certificateless public key encryption (CL-PKE) schemes over mobile ad hoc network (MANET), {{which has not been}} explored before. In current literature, essentially there exists two main approaches, namely the public key cryptography and identity-based (ID-based) cryptography. Unfortunately, they both have some inherent drawbacks. In the public key cryptography system, a certificate authority (CA) is required to issue certificates between users 2 ̆ 7 public keys and private keys to ensure their authenticity, whilst in an ID-based cryptography system, users 2 ̆ 7 private keys are generated by a key generation center (KGC), which means the KGC knows every users 2 ̆ 7 keys (the key escrow problem). To avoid these obstacles, Al-Riyami and Paterson proposed certificateless cryptography systems where the public keys {{do not need to be}} certified and the KGC does not know users 2 ̆ 7 keys. Essentially, certificateless cryptography relies between the public key cryptography and ID-based cryptography. In this work, we adopt this system 2 ̆ 7 s advantage over MANET.

40|$|A Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) is {{an ideal}} network that merely {{consists}} of mobiles devices without any pre-established infrastructure. However, the secure communication over a MANET is not straightforward. In this thesis, we present a solution for MANET secure communication. Generally speaking, it covers two main areas, namely key management and secure routing. In the key management area, we present an idea of adopting certificateless public key encryption (CL-PKE) schemes over mobile ad hoc network (MANET), which have not been explored before. In the current literature, there exists two main approaches, namely public key cryptography and identity-based (ID-based) cryptography. Unfortunately, they both have some inherent drawbacks. To avoid these obstacles, Al-Riyami and Paterson proposed certificateless cryptography systems. In this thesis, we adopt Al-Riyami’s advantage over MANET.

The <b>master</b> <b>secret</b> <b>keys</b> are shared among some or all the MANET nodes. This makes the system self-organized once the network has been initiated. In order to provide more flexibility, we consider both a full distribution system and a partial distribution system. In the secure routing area, we present the idea of adopting a reputation system over the optimized link state routing (OLSR) protocol. In the literature, there exists two main routing approaches, namely proactive routing and reactive routing. Several secure reactive routing protocols have beenproposed. However, as far as proactive routing is concerned, few secure protocols are presented, yet they all possess different drawbacks that make them only practical on certain routing protocols. One of major problems is how to determine whether a node is worthy of trust or not. In other networks, for example, peer-to-peer sharing networks, reputation systems are designed to judge users. Unfortunately, they are designed specifically for peer-to-peer systems, while the adoption to MANET is not very straightforward. To this end, we present our Rep-OLSR, which selects routes wisely based on users’ former performance by periodically collecting polling results from neighbour nodes. Finally, we demonstrate that our solution is robust against several types of attacks. We also test our solution with several simulations. The results of the simulations indicate that our solution efficiently secure the communication with little extra traffic compared with pure MANET routing protocols...|$|R

40|$|Predicate {{encryption}} {{is a new}} encryption paradigm {{which gives}} a <b>master</b> <b>secret</b> <b>key</b> owner fine-grained control over access to encrypted data. The <b>master</b> <b>secret</b> <b>key</b> owner can generate secret key tokens corresponding to predicates.

Prior work on public-key predicate encryption {{has focused on the}} notion of data or plaintext privacy, the property that ciphertexts reveal no information about the encrypted data to an attacker other than what is inherently revealed by the tokens the attacker possesses. In this paper, we consider a new notion called predicate privacy, the property that tokens reveal no information about the encoded query predicate. Predicate privacy is inherently impossible to achieve in the public-key setting and has therefore received little attention in prior work. In this work, we consider predicate encryption in the symmetric-key setting and present a symmetrickey predicate encryption scheme which supports inner product queries. We prove that our scheme achieves both plaintext privacy and predicate privacy. ...|$|E
40|$|In certificateless {{public key}} {{encryption}} (CL-PKE), the Private Key Generator (PKG) keeps a <b>master</b> <b>secret</b> <b>key</b> to generate a partial private key corresponding to a user's identity. Together with a secret value generated by the user, a full private key can be constructed for decryption. Traditional security model for CL-PKE assumes that (i) both the <b>master</b> <b>secret</b> <b>key</b> of the PKG and the full private key of the user under attack are in absolute secrecy; and (ii) the attacker can only obtain either the target user's secret value without any partial knowledge of the partial private key or vice versa. However, the advancement of practical side-channel attacks enable attackers to obtain partial information of both keys easily, making the above assumption invalid. In this paper, we give the first leakage-resilient CL-PKE. We consider different leakage conditions for Type I (third party attackers) and Type II (honest-but-curious PKG) attackers, following the classification in traditional CL-PKE. We give a concrete construction in the composite order bilinear group. We prove the security of our scheme in the standard model, overcoming some technical difficulties in the security proofs for both Type I and Type II attackers of CL-PKE. © 2013 ACM...|$|E

Identity based {{encryption}} and signature schemes {{are public}} key schemes where an identity, {{such as an}} arbitrary string like an email address or biometric data, {{is the basis for}} the public key. Identity Based Encryption requires the use of a Private Key Generator that creates an associated private key given a public key generated from the identity and a <b>secret</b> <b>master</b> <b>key.</b> The security of such a system depends on keeping the <b>master</b> <b>key</b> a <b>secret.</b> Identity Based Signature schemes are subtly different but still require the secure generation of a key. We design and develop on card software to perform multiple precision arithmetic and elliptic curve arithmetic over finite fields required for the implementation of Identity Based Encryption and Signature schemes. We also develop Java Card applets to enable secure key generation. This allows for a portable private key generator so that, for example, a system administrator can securely generate and distribute private keys to potential users at their terminal after performing appropriate authenti-cation procedures. We also show how our system can easily accommodate new algorithms with minimal re-engineering. We then outline how this can be used to counteract specified attacks on the card including side channel attacks...|$|R
