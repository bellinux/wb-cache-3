5|$|According to {{management}} researcher John J. Clancey, scientific management can involve {{the use of}} throffers. While piecework had been utilised since the Middle Ages, Frederick Winslow Taylor blended rationalised management with piecework, {{to create a new}} system. Productivity processes were standardised, after which point <b>managers</b> <b>were</b> able to present a throffer to workers: higher pay was offered if they were able to exceed the standard, while lower pay was threatened for any who did not meet expectations.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012, the United States Food and Drug Administration {{issued a}} warning to the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group {{regarding}} HAACP (hazard analysis and critical control points) violations that were found at a processing plant in Irving, Texas. FDA found that lemon and lime juice was held in unsanitary conditions, which was a potential health threat to consumers. Company <b>managers</b> <b>were</b> advised by FDA that a reduction in microorganism levels was necessary to protect consumers.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{in areas}} where the new wages were applied, {{factories}} would struggle to recruit workers for important tasks because the reform had given a low pay grade to a task that was considered to require a lower level of skill. For example, machine-tool operation was given a low pay grade, and at one factory in Kotlyakov some 30 machine-tools sat unused as factory <b>managers</b> <b>were</b> unable to recruit workers to operate them.|$|E

5|$|The {{place where}} the clock was situated, and its <b>managers,</b> <b>were</b> collectively known as khaneh fenjaan. Usually {{this would be the}} top floor of a public-house, with west- and east-facing windows to show the time of sunset and sunrise. There was also another {{time-keeping}} tool named a staryab or astrolabe, but it was mostly used for superstitious beliefs and was not practical for use as a farmers' calendar. The Zeebad Gonabad water clock was in use until 1965 when it was substituted by modern clocks.|$|E
5|$|Following further {{disputes}} and delays, {{it was reported}} in March 2010 that Edinburgh Council was considering cancelling the contract with Bilfinger Berger. By June 2010, the project's cost had risen to £600 million. Council project <b>managers</b> <b>were</b> reported to be in crisis talks, considering options including: borrowing £55 million to fund the increased costs; phasing {{the introduction of the}} tram line, so that trams would initially run between the airport and Haymarket; and terminating the contract with Bilfinger Berger.

5|$|The {{role of a}} Scotland {{national}} football team manager was first established in May 1954, when Andy Beattie was appointed. Beattie took charge of six matches {{before and during the}} 1954 FIFA World Cup, when Scotland competed at their first major tournament. Twenty-two men have occupied the post since its inception, with Beattie and Jock Stein occupying it in two different spells. Five of those <b>managers</b> <b>were</b> in caretaker or interim roles. Craig Brown held the position for the longest to date; a tenure of 9 years, comprising two major tournaments and a total of 71 matches.|$|E
5|$|In the era before league football, the {{position}} of manager involved many secretarial duties, such as arranging fixtures and the upkeep of the club's ground. Few accounts of the club's off-field affairs in the 1880s survive, and it is unclear who managed the club (then known as West Gorton (St. Marks)) between 1882 and 1884. The club's earliest <b>managers</b> <b>were</b> also players; the first three known managers (Frederick Hopkinson, Edward Kitchen and Walter Chew) all played in West Gorton's first recorded match in 1880. By 1889 the club had moved to Hyde Road and renamed itself Ardwick A.F.C. Under the management of Lawrence Furniss, the club joined the Football League in 1892 as founder members of the Second Division. Furniss became chairman a year later, {{and he and his}} successor as secretary-manager Joshua Parlby were responsible for Ardwick reforming as Manchester City F.C. in 1894.|$|E
5|$|Once the 1999 season started, {{a moment}} of peace {{occurred}} between the fans. Yankees manager Joe Torre returned to Fenway Park for his first game following a battle with prostate cancer. While the <b>managers</b> <b>were</b> exchanging lineup cards, the Boston crowd gave Torre a long standing ovation, to which he tipped his cap. Good relations were seen during the All-Star Game at Fenway Park. Yankee manager Joe Torre, manager for the American League team, replaced starting shortstop Nomar Garciaparra of the Red Sox with Derek Jeter. Garciaparra received a standing ovation from the fans after Jeter came in to replace him (they also embraced each other at this time). Later in the game, {{when he came to}} bat, Jeter gave Garciaparra a tribute by mimicking his batting stance. Nine years later, in a similar fashion, Red Sox manager Terry Francona managed the American League team at the All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium, in the stadium's final season.|$|E

5|$|The Malayan Emergency was {{declared}} on 18 June 1948, after three estate <b>managers</b> <b>were</b> murdered {{by members of}} the Malayan Communist Party (MCP). Australian involvement began in June 1950, when in response to a British request, six Lincolns from No. 1 Squadron and a flight of Dakotas from No. 38 Squadron arrived in Singapore to form part of the British Commonwealth Far East Air Force (FEAF). The Dakotas were subsequently used on cargo runs, troop movement, as well as paratroop and leaflet drops, while the Lincoln bombers carried out bombing raids against the Communist Terrorist (CT) jungle bases. The RAAF were particularly successful, and in one such mission known as Operation Termite, five Lincoln bombers destroyed 181 communist camps, killed 13 communists and forced one into surrender, in a joint operation with the RAF and ground troops. The Lincolns were withdrawn in 1958, and were replaced by Canberra bombers from No. 2 Squadron and CAC Sabres from No. 78 Wing. Based at RAAF Base Butterworth they also carried out a number ground attack missions against the guerrillas.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 39{{managers}} for the Pittsburgh Pirates franchise. The Pirates' first manager was Horace Phillips, who had coached the team before their {{move to the}} National League. In 1900, Fred Clarke began his tenure with the franchise. Clarke's 1422victories and 969losses lead all managers of the Pirates in their respective categories, Clarke also had the longest tenure as manager in his 16years in the position. Clarke managed the franchise to its first World Series victory, a feat that would also be accomplished by Bill McKechnie, Danny Murtaugh, and Chuck Tanner. Thirteen Pirates managers have been player-managers—those who take on simultaneous roles {{as a player and}} manager. McKechnie, Connie Mack, and Ned Hanlon were inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum as managers. Five Pirates <b>managers</b> <b>were</b> inducted into the Hall of Fame for their performance as players.

Hired before the 2011 season, the Pirates' current manager is Clint Hurdle.|$|E
5|$|Water clocks, or Fenjaan, in Persia {{reached a}} level of {{accuracy}} comparable to today's standards of timekeeping. The fenjaan was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from a qanat or well for irrigation of the farms, until it was replaced by more accurate current clock. Persian water clocks were a practical and useful tool for the qanat's shareholders to calculate {{the length of time}} they could divert water to their farm. The qanat was the only water source for agriculture and irrigation so a just and fair water distribution was very important. Therefore, a very fair and clever old person was elected to be the manager of the water clock, and at least two full-time <b>managers</b> <b>were</b> needed to control and observe the number of fenjaans and announce the exact time during the days and nights.|$|E
