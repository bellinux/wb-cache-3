40|$|Although the {{consumption}} of organic produce has dramatically increased {{in recent years and}} many outbreaks continue to occur, the <b>microbiological</b> <b>safety</b> of organic produce has not been fully assessed. This study generated microbiological data to evaluate organic produce safety and also assessed the impact of growing methods (ground cover effects) and handling methods (washing practices) in organic lettuce systems. The study evaluated <b>microbiological</b> <b>safety</b> of pre- and post-harvest fresh produce samples from small organic farms in Maryland, the effect of mulching on survival of indicator bacteria and the impact of post-harvest washing method on <b>microbiological</b> <b>safety</b> and epiphytic bacterial communities. Results indicate that (1) washed post-harvest produce had higher risks than unwashed and pre-harvest organic produce as measured by indicator bacteria E. coli, total coliforms, APC, yeast and mold; (2) different mulches affected the microbial levels differently; (3) different washing methods altered the bacterial communities both immediately and following 5 days of storage.

40|$|Laboratories {{throughout}} the world that perform work with Risk Group 4 Pathogens generally adopt one of two approaches within BSL- 4 environments: either the use of positive pressure air-fed suits or using Class III <b>microbiological</b> <b>safety</b> cabinets and isolators for animal work. Within the UK at present, all laboratories working with Risk Group 4 agents adopt the use of Class III <b>microbiological</b> <b>safety</b> cabinet lines and isolators. Operator protection factors {{for the use of}} <b>microbiological</b> <b>safety</b> cabinets and isolators are available however; there is limited published data on the operator protection factors afforded by the use of positive pressure suits. This study evaluated the operator protection factors provided by positive pressure air suits against a realistic airborne microbiological challenge. The suits were tested, both intact and with their integrity compromised, on an animated mannequin within a stainless steel exposure chamber. The suits gave operator protection in all tests with an intact suit and with a cut in the leg. When compromised by a cut in the glove, a very small ingress of the challenge was seen as far as the wrist. This is likely to be due to the low airflow in the gloves of the suit. In all cases no microbiological penetration of the respiratory tract was observed. These data provide evidence on which to base safety protocols for use of positive pressure suits within high containment laboratories...|$|R

The main {{purpose of the current}} study was, therefore, to assess the <b>microbiological</b> <b>safety</b> of sponges as it has been used in selected food establishments of Jimma town. Accordingly, the <b>microbiological</b> <b>safety</b> of a total of 201 kitchen sponges randomly collected from food establishments was evaluated against the total counts of aerobic mesophilic bacteria (AMB), Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, and yeast and molds. The mean counts of aerobic mesophilic bacteria ranged from 7. 43 to 12. 44 [*]log[*]CFU/mm 3. The isolated genera were dominated by Pseudomonas (16. 9 %), Bacillus (11. 1 %), Micrococcus (10. 6 %), Streptococcus (7. 8 %), and Lactobacillus (6 %) excluding the unidentified Gram positive rods (4. 9 %) and Gram negative rods (9. 9 %).

40|$|The use of porcine tissues {{is being}} {{developed}} {{as a means to}} alleviate the shortage of allogeneic tissues and organs available for transplantation. To reduce the possibility of a microorganism of pigs being inadvertently transferred to the recipient of the xenograft, recommendations have been published on the microbiological specifications for organ source pigs. The porcine circoviruses (PCV 1 and PCV 2) and porcine lymphotropic herpesviruses (PLHV 1 and PLHV 2) are two infectious agents of pigs which are considered to be of significance for the <b>microbiological</b> <b>safety</b> of xenotransplantation. To ensure the exclusion of these microorganisms from animals destined for use under clinical conditions, reliable breeding methodologies are required. We investigated the efficiency of established derivation procedures for the removal of PCV and PLHV. In comparison with conventionally reared pigs, caesarian and barrier derived animals showed a markedly reduced prevalence of PCVs and PLHVs. Our results indicate that the derivation of animals free of both of these microorganisms is achievable and will enhance the <b>microbiological</b> <b>safety</b> of xenotransplantation...|$|R

40|$|In 1994, in {{response}} to the outcomes of a joint Advisory Committee of <b>Microbiological</b> <b>Safety</b> of Food (ACMSF) and Steering Group on the <b>Microbiological</b> <b>Safety</b> of Food (SGMSF) meeting, a Working Group was set up to investigate the science and epidemiology of Foodborne Viral Infections. The Working Group assessed the risk from viruses that were believed to be the primary cause of foodborne illness. This report provides an update to this information and provides a new focus on the viruses which are currently the major route of foodborne illness. Since the publication of the 1998 report, with the exception of two minor risk assessments on hepatitis E and avian influenza, no formal review on viruses had been performed by the ACMSF. It was decided that as significant developments had been made not only in the detection of foodborne viruses, but also in the amount of information obtained from the Infectious Intestinal Disease (IID) Study in England (published in 2000), which indicated a significant disease burden from enteric viruses in the community, it was important that an Ad-Hoc Group was convened to revisit these issues and to provide an update to the 1998 risk assessment...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} giving insight into <b>microbiological</b> <b>safety</b> output of a Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) -based Food Safety Management System (FSMS) of a Nile perch {{exporting}} company {{by using a}} combined assessment, This study aimed at giving insight into <b>microbiological</b> <b>safety</b> output of a Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) -based Food Safety Management System (FSMS) of a Nile perch exporting company by using a combined assessment, FSMS-diagnosis and actual microbiological assessment. The FSMS diagnosis indicated FSMS activities at an average level operating in moderate-risk context level but with good system output. Likewise, microbiological assessment revealed a better system output with respect to pathogens (Vibrio cholerae, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp.) and faecal hygiene (Escherichia coli) as none of these were detected in any critical sampling location throughout the study. Although indicators of general process hygiene (that is, Enterobacteriaceae and TVC) exceeded regulatory limits and guidelines in raw materials and food contact materials, Staphylococcus aureus on operator’s hands were beyond the general microbiological guidelines in the fish industry. Higher contamination levels of general process hygiene and personal hygiene indicators call for improvement on hygienic design, specific production and sanitation procedures, independent validation, process automation, and change in personnel recruitment criteria...|$|R
50|$|In February 1944 Anellis {{joined the}} newly created U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps Food and Container Institute in Chicago, and worked on {{problems}} of the <b>microbiological</b> <b>safety</b> of foods being shipped overseas to U.S. servicemen. Dehydrated milk and dehydrated eggs were products developed at this time for which Anellis tested the <b>microbiological</b> <b>safety.</b> Anellis's research focused on strains of bacteria which were especially heat-resistant, including salmonella and clostridium botulinum. This led to the consideration {{of the use of}} gamma radiation as a food preservative, and Anellis began research on the radiation resistance of bacteria in canned foods. In 1963 the Food and Container Institute was closed and its operations were moved to the U.S. Army Natick Research and Development Laboratories in Natick, Massachusetts. Anellis continued his research on the radiation resistance of bacteria at the Natick Labs until his retirement in 1977. While working at the Natick Labs he also participated in the program to develop foods and food preservations for NASA. Anellis was an advocate of irradiation of foods as a food preservative and preventative against microbiological contamination, and testified before the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on the safety of human consumption of foods irradiated at low dosage.|$|R
