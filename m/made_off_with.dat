5|$|A week later, Marion's sister Lila {{arrives in}} Fairvale and confronts Sam about the {{whereabouts}} of her sister. Private investigator Milton Arbogast approaches them and confirms that Marion is wanted for stealing the $40,000. He checks the motels, and Norman's evasive and inconsistent answers arouse his suspicions. After hearing that Marion had met Norman's mother, he asks to speak with her, but Norman refuses. Arbogast calls Lila and Sam to update them. He goes to the Bates' home in search of Norman's mother; as he reaches {{the top of the}} stairs, he is attacked and murdered. When Lila and Sam do not hear from Arbogast, Sam visits the motel. He finds only Mrs. Bates, who ignores his knocking. Lila and Sam go to the local sheriff, who informs them that Mrs. Bates killed herself ten years ago, and concludes that Arbogast lied to confuse them and <b>made</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> the $40,000. Still convinced that some ill has befallen Arbogast, Lila and Sam {{make their way to the}} motel. Norman takes his unwilling mother from her room and hides her in the fruit cellar.|$|E

25|$|In 1966 a {{group of}} {{students}} from National College of Art and Design stole the head of lord Nelson's Pillar, which had been blown up by Irish nationalists in March 1966. The head had been stored in a shed off Clanbrassil Street by Dublin City Corporation. The students broke into the shed and put the head {{in the back of a}} hatchback and <b>made</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> it.

25|$|In July 2001, it was {{discovered}} that two Halberstadt residents (aged 24 and 26) had gained entry to the tunnel system through an unsecured opening and <b>made</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> numerous banknotes. The two residents were convicted of the crime and sentenced to four months in prison and three years of probation. Furthermore, they had to pay €120 to a non-profit organisation. The appearance among collectors of uncirculated 200 and 500 Mark notes, and of the never-issued military currency, is attributed to this theft. Because of the theft and the slowness of the rotting, the KfW then decided to burn the old currency. Between April and June 2002, 298 containers of the currency remains were burned in an incinerator (six containers per day) along with household refuse. The last container was burned on 25 June 2002.|$|E

60|$|This was no {{scene to}} put our minds at rest: a couple of armed men in sea-clothes found quarrelling over a treasure, not many miles from where a pirate had been captured--here was enough to bring the whole country about our ears. The quarrel was not even made up; it was blotted from our minds; and we got our packets {{together}} in the twinkling of an eye, and <b>made</b> <b>off,</b> running <b>with</b> the best will in the world. But the trouble was, {{we did not know}} in what direction, and must continually return upon our steps.

25|$|On 22 September 2006, French Air Force jets {{were seen}} over the skies of Beirut during Hassan Nasrallah's victory speech, {{possibly}} trying {{to protect him from}} an Israeli assassination attempt. Nasrallah told the crowd that he had no fear in addressing the masses directly, rather than through armored glass. In September 2006, Hezbollah fighters raided an Israeli arms depot in Shomera, and <b>made</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> a large quantity of sidearms, grenades, anti-tank weapons, and LAU rockets. Five Israeli Merkava tanks, an armored bulldozer, and a number of military vehicles entered Lebanon and attempted to search the Hezbollah-controlled village of Marwahin for the arms. They were confronted by four French Army Leclerc tanks, which blocked their advance. The confrontation lasted for half an hour. According to American and German correspondents, the French retreated, while the French commander claimed that the Israelis had turned back. French commander of UNIFIL Alain Pellegrini stated that France would not intervene to disarm Hezbollah.|$|E
25|$|The next scene {{takes place}} in this back room. Drunk, Tamashima draws his sword and reveals himself as Nippon Daemon in a rousing speech, before {{demanding}} Kōbei hand over {{all the money in}} the shop. Though Rikimaru and Kozō have <b>made</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> 100 ryō, the entire ordeal was a ruse to help Daemon earn Kōbei's trust, and to get himself into the back room. Sōnosuke throws himself between the two, offering his own life instead of that of his father-in-law; Daemon stops, noting that he once had a son who would be roughly Sōnosuke's age. The two older men begin to talk about their pasts and come to the realization that not only is Daemon Sōnosuke's true father, but Kōbei is in fact Kozō's true father. Both men, for differing reasons, lost their sons at a crowded ritual ceremony at the Hase-dera over a decade prior, and agree to forget about Daemon's criminal scheme as they thank one another for taking care of one another's sons, though Kōbei does ask that Daemon attempt to turn all five of the thieves away from their lives of crime.|$|E
25|$|During his {{period at}} Contimporanul, Dan {{embarked}} on a conflict with the Surrealist and far leftist group at unu, the magazine of poet Sașa Pană. This controversy reflected the major discrepancies between Contimporanul and other avant-garde venues. By 1930, Sergiu's brother Mihail Dan had left Bilete de Papagal and had become involved with unu, {{of which he was}} later editor in chief. However, documents first made public in 2008 show that he was secretly an informant for the Kingdom of Romania's intelligence agency, Siguranța Statului, with a mission to supervise unus ongoing flirtations with communism. He had for long been suspected of this by the literary society at Sburătorul. Also in 1930, shortly after the forceful return of Romanian King Carol II to the throne, Sergiu Dan was working, as political editor, on the staff of Dreptatea, the platform of the National Peasants' Party (PNȚ). According to the later account of communist journalist Petre Pandrea, Dan and Vinea together stole the original draft of an article by PNȚ economist Virgil Madgearu, and forged it in such manner as to make it seem that Madgearu was an anti-Carlist; they then sold a copy to Madgearu's rival, the corporatist theorist Mihail Manoilescu. Manoilescu took a copy of this document to Carol, discrediting himself when the forgery was exposed. Pandrea claimed that, between them, Dan and Vinea <b>made</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> 150,000 lei from the affair, whereas their victim Manoilescu fell into permanent disfavor.|$|E

40|$|We {{extend the}} model of {{voluntary}} contributions to multiple public goods by allowing for bundling of the public goods. Specifically, we study the case where agents contribute into a common pool which is then allocated towards the financing of two pure public goods. We explore the welfare implications of allowing for such bundling vis-a-vis a separate contributions scheme. We show that when agents have homogeneous preferences, they cannot be <b>made</b> better <b>off</b> <b>with</b> a bundling scheme. On the contrary, in the generic case when agents are heterogenous in their incomes and preferences, bundling may increase joint welfare compared to a separate contribution scheme, in particular for higher income inequality among the agents. It {{is interesting to note}} that the welfare improvement occurs despite a decrease in total contributions. Our findings have implications for the design of charitable institutions and international aid agencies. Private provision, Public goods, Bundling...|$|R
60|$|It was a {{magnificent}} morning {{in early spring}} when I watched among the trees to see the procession come down the hillside. The upper air was woven with {{the music of the}} larks, and my whole world thrilled with the conception of summer. The young pale wind-flowers had arisen by the wood-gale, and under the hazels, when perchance the hot sun pushed his way, new little suns dawned, and blazed with real light. There was a certain thrill and quickening everywhere, as a woman must feel when she has conceived. A sallow tree in a favoured spot looked like a pale gold cloud of summer dawn; nearer it had poised a golden, fairy busby on every twig, and was voiced with a hum of bees, like any sacred golden bush, uttering its gladness in the thrilling murmur of bees, and in warm scent. Birds called and flashed on every hand; they <b>made</b> <b>off</b> exultant <b>with</b> streaming strands of grass, or wisps of fleece, plunging into the dark spaces of the wood, and out again into the blue.|$|R

500|$|Gian Giacomo Caprotti da Oreno, nicknamed Salai or Il Salaino ("The Little Unclean One" [...] i.e., the devil), entered Leonardo's {{household}} in 1490.

Nevertheless, Leonardo treated him with great indulgence, and he remained in Leonardo's household for the next thirty years. Salai executed a number of paintings under the name of Andrea Salai, but although Vasari claims that Leonardo [...] "taught him a great deal about painting", his work is generally considered to be of less artistic merit than others among Leonardo's pupils, such as Marco d'Oggiono and Boltraffio. In 1515, he painted a nude version of the Mona Lisa, known as Monna Vanna. Salai owned the Mona Lisa {{at the time of his}} death in 1524, and in his will it was assessed at 505 lire, an exceptionally high valuation for a small panel portrait.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} leverage {{on the effectiveness of}} a self-financed tax-subsidy program offered by a government in stimulating a firm’s investment. We show that the firm, be it levered or unlevered, has an incentive to hasten its investment because of the agency conflicts arising from the commitment made by the government on the terms of the tax-subsidy program. We further show that the levered firm has a countervailing incentive to defer its investment due to the deadweight loss when bankruptcy occurs, which would be absent should the firm be unlevered. The former incentive is likely to be dominated by the latter incentive, in particular when the corporate income tax rate is sufficiently high and the bankruptcy cost is sufficiently low so that the firm relies heavily on debt. In this case, the tax-subsidy program induces the levered firm to defer, not hasten, its investment. Finally, we show that the levered firm is <b>made</b> worse <b>off</b> <b>with</b> than without the program {{because of the presence of}} agency and bankruptcy costs. postprin...|$|R

500|$|Goldfaden seems, in Bercovici's words, to {{have lost}} [...] "his {{theatrical}} elan" [...] in this period. He briefly put together a theater company in 1886 in Warsaw, with no notable success. In 1887 he went to New York (as did Mogulescu, independently). After extensive negotiations and great anticipation in the Yiddish-language press in New York ("Goldfaden in America," [...] read the headline in the 11 January 1888 edition of the New Yorker Yiddishe Ilustrirte Zaitung), he briefly took on the job of director of Mogulescu's new [...] "Rumanian Opera House"; they parted ways again after the failure of their first play, whose production values were apparently not up to New York standards. Goldfaden attempted (unsuccessfully) to found a theater school, then headed in 1889 for Paris, rather low on funds. There he wrote some poetry, worked on a play that he didn't finish at that time, and put together a theater company that never {{got to the point}} of putting on a play (because the cashier <b>made</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> all of their funds).

500|$|The {{link between}} Prester John and Genghis Khan was {{elaborated}} upon at this time, as the Prester became identified with Genghis' foster father, Toghrul, {{king of the}} Keraites, given the Jin title Ong Khan Toghrul. Fairly truthful chroniclers and explorers such as Marco Polo, Crusader-historian Jean de Joinville, and the Franciscan voyager Odoric of Pordenone stripped Prester John of much of his otherworldly veneer, portraying him as a more realistic earthly monarch. Odoric places John's land {{to the west of}} Cathay en route to Europe, and mentions its capital as Casan, which may correspond to Kazan, the Tatar capital near Moscow. Joinville describes Genghis Khan in his chronicle as a [...] "wise man" [...] who unites all the Tartar tribes and leads them to victory against their strongest enemy, Prester John. William of Rubruck says a certain [...] "Vut", lord of the Keraites and brother to the Nestorian King John, was defeated by the Mongols under Genghis. Genghis <b>made</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> Vut's daughter and married her to his son, and their union produced Möngke, the Khan at the time William wrote. According to Marco Polo's Travels, the war between the Prester and Genghis started when Genghis, new ruler of the rebellious Tartars, asked for the hand of Prester John's daughter in marriage. Angered that his lowly vassal would make such a request, Prester John denied him in no uncertain terms. In the war that followed, Genghis triumphed and Prester John perished.|$|E
