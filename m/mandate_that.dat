5|$|Following the {{issuance}} of the Churchill White Paper in June 1922, the House of Lords rejected a Palestine <b>Mandate</b> <b>that</b> incorporated the Balfour Declaration by 60 votes to 25, following a motion issued by Lord Islington.

5|$|Cordray {{was granted}} a ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court that lower courts could not grant a stay of {{execution}} for a death row inmate. At the same time, Fisher, Cordray's boss, sought a referendum to <b>mandate</b> <b>that</b> appeals in death penalty cases be made directly to the Supreme Court. In 1994 the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Steffen v. Tate (39 F.3d 622 1994) limited death row inmates to a single federal appeal and said that federal courts cannot stay an execution if the case is still in a state court.|$|E

5|$|On 6 March, Tirpitz, {{escorted by}} three destroyers, {{launched}} {{a raid on}} the British convoys to the Soviet Union. The Germans attempted to intercept convoys PQ-12 and QP-8, but the inclement weather prevented them from finding the convoys. The British located Tirpitz, and the aircraft carrier Victorious launched a strike of twelve Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers. The aircraft were repulsed without having scored any hits on the German ships. Tirpitz and the destroyers were back in port by 12 March. The close call prompted Hitler to <b>mandate</b> <b>that</b> Tirpitz was not to attack another convoy unless its escorting aircraft carrier had been sunk or disabled.|$|E

Two {{days before}} his inauguration, he and outgoing governor Charles Scott met at the state house to appoint William Henry Harrison commander of the Kentucky militia.

5|$|The Zurich council {{decided that}} no {{compromise}} was possible. On 7 March 1526 it released the notorious <b>mandate</b> <b>that</b> no one shall rebaptise another under the penalty of death. Although Zwingli, technically, {{had nothing to}} do with the mandate, there is no indication that he disapproved. Felix Manz, who had sworn to leave Zurich and not to baptise any more, had deliberately returned and continued the practice. After he was arrested and tried, he was executed on 5 January 1527 by being drowned in the Limmat. He was the first Anabaptist martyr; three more were to follow, after which all others either fled or were expelled from Zurich.|$|E

5|$|The last {{building}} constructed at Fort Yellowstone was the chapel, {{located just}} south of the original guardhouse. Army policy did not <b>mandate</b> <b>that</b> army forts provide places of worship. However, at the insistence of park superintendent Pitcher, U.S. Commissioner Meldrum and Wyoming state senator Francis E. Warren, Congress appropriated the funds {{for the construction of a}} chapel in 1909 and the building was finished in January 1913. On September 19, 1914, Katharine Piercy Edmunds and Captain Albert Ady King, 1st U.S. Cavalry, were the first couple to be married in the new chapel. Reverend Pritchard, an Episcopalian missionary, traveled to the fort from Emigrant, Montana to perform the ceremony.|$|E

Vastly outnumbered and frustrated by a <b>mandate</b> <b>that</b> did not allow them to engage the perpetrators, the infantrymen were forced into a passive role during the massacre. Throughout the incident, however, they worked under fire attempting to assist wounded refugees. Meanwhile, 8/9 RAR was disbanded in 1997 after the discontinuation of the Ready Reserve scheme.|$|E

Although uncommon, it is legal for a liquor store to deliver {{alcoholic beverages}} by car or van to a person's home.

5|$|Rodríguez Saá {{prepared}} a budget bill for 2002, which {{was sent to}} the Congress. It included an important decrease in the deficits, as requested by Anne Krueger from the International Monetary Fund. Krueger also requested a new coparticipation law, to determine the way the nation and the provinces manage tax revenues. Rodríguez Saá called for a meeting with governors in Chapadmalal, but only six governors out of twenty-three attended: Carlos Ruckauf, Juan Carlos Romero, Gildo Insfrán, Ángel Mazza, Carlos Rovira and Alicia Lemme. José Manuel de la Sota, governor of Córdoba, withdrew his support, suspecting that Rodríguez Saá had plans to cancel the elections and stay as president up to 2003. On December 30, he returned to San Luis with Daniel Scioli and resigned, alleging lack of support {{from the rest of the}} Justicialist Party. Insfrán, Maza and minister Rodolfo Gabrielli tried to convince him to stay as president; his brother Alberto Rodríguez Saá supported his decision. In announcing his resignation in a Cadena nacional, he recounted the achievements of his one-week administration and accused Justicialist governors and legislators of meanness and shortsightedness. He dispatched his resignation from San Luis to Buenos Aires, and the Congress accepted it on January 1, 2002. The Senate chairman Ramón Puerta would have been the interim president, but resigned as well, so Eduardo Camaño, president of the Chamber of Deputies, was appointed interim president instead. After new deliberations, they elected Eduardo Duhalde as president, this time with a <b>mandate</b> <b>that</b> would fill the remaining time of delaRúa's mandate.|$|E
