40|$|Purpose: Technology is an {{important}} driver of organizational change and often strategically used to facilitate adaptations in organizational processes and cultures. While the link between technological and organizational change is widely recognized, the role of <b>macro-context</b> for this link remains undervalued. Based on data from technology implementations in European police forces the paper aims to illustrate the importance of integrating analyses of the <b>macro-context</b> to understand the complexity of technology driven organizational change. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted 56 interviews and five focus groups with police officers from 13 countries {{on two of the}} major technology trends in European police forces: automatic number plate recognition systems (ANPR) systems and social media. They further conducted site visits to police forces in The Netherlands and the United Kingdom to observe technology usage first hand. Comparing accounts across countries th ey analyzed how <b>macro-context</b> impacted adoption decisions and implementation processes. In this analysis they concentrated on the five macro-contextual factors in the PESTL framework, i. e. political, economic, social, technological and legal factors. Findings: In analyses of ANPR systems and social media the paper details how the <b>macro-context</b> of police organizations impacted decisions to adopt a technology as well as the intra-organizational alignments of processes and structures. Practical implications: Organizational decision makers and implementers need to be aware not only of the strong agency of technology for organizations' structure and processes, but also of the relevance of the organizational <b>macro-context</b> for the process and impact of technology implementations on the organizational as well as individual level.

40|$|With China {{continuing}} {{its policy}} of reform and opening and Australia strategically turning to Asia, the period since the mid- 1980 s has witnessed escalating Chinese immigration to Australia. Against this backdrop, the ethnic Chinese community in Australia has changed significantly, particularly in respect of its demographic characteristics, socio-economic activities, and status, and is now widely perceived as a model and middle class ethnic community. Adopting a “dual-embeddedness” framework, this chapter offers a political-economic analysis of the ethnic Chinese community's transformation {{over the past three}} decades or so, highlighting the influence of socio-economic and political <b>macro-contexts</b> and ever-increasing inflows of Chinese migrants, students, investors, and tourists. This chapter details the expression and mechanism of Australian Chinese community’s dual embeddedness. It shows that the ethnic Chinese community in Australia has been simultaneously embedded in the nation building processes in both Australia and China and suggests that the community is not merely a beneficiary of these processes, but also an active agent and contributor.

40|$|This article aims {{to discuss}} the {{potentials}} of an integrated approach to two significant fields of practice: materiality and migration. Based {{on the results of}} a preliminary approach to the Portuguese migrant community in Toronto and three previous ethnographies with Portuguese and Indi-Portuguese migrants conducted in Lisbon, Maputo and four Brazilian cities, it intends in particular to explore the various ways in which the home and home-making as a social and cultural process can work as a significant field to explore that relation. It will be argued that domestic materiality constitutes a particularly productive field to look at the relationships between <b>macro-contexts</b> and micro-practices, social formations and cultural institutions that affect and shape the life experiences of those who migrate.

40|$|There {{have been}} various {{approaches}} to conceptualising design management issues, {{but most of}} these have considered design management from an organisational perspective, in isolation from {{the context in which the}} design profession is practised - the design industry - and thus are unlikely to capture the emerging issues driven by design industry trends. Sun’s paper proposes a conceptual framework positioning design management within the industry’s knowledge supply chain, defining it as the management of the interface between design practice and other industry forces. Design management thus becomes relevant to a significantly wider body of stakeholders. Sun’s research is developed in three stages: a descriptive framework of the design industry; its use to locate design management; and evaluation by comparison with existing theoretical concepts and models. Through extensive analysis of the existing literature, it identifies roles missing from classical design management theory, identifying new areas of responsibility. Unlike many contributions to the field, it is sensitive to differences between organisations, and to those between <b>macro-contexts</b> including national attitudes to design management, highlighting questions of transferability. Local and regional differences are accentuated by recent change, such as the UK’s shift towards a knowledge economy while emerging nations industrialise. This is significant for the teaching of design management and its relevance to international students returning to local circumstances. The paper has been referenced in journal articles, including Erichsen & Christensen (2013) in Creativity and Innovation Management 22 (2) and Starostka (2011) in Swedish Design Research Journal 2 (12), in conference contributions and a forthcoming Springer book chapter (Nelson et al 2014) ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a comprehensive analysis of metapragmatic comments (MPCs) in institutional talk. It {{is based on}} a comparison of their functions in a range of institutional settings and consists in a meta-analysis of results based on a series of corpora collected and analysed by the two authors (jointly or individually) over roughly a 10 -year period, integrated by further data collected mainly in educational settings. The contexts examined can be broadly defined as either ‘educational’ or ‘media’ contexts. The former category includes interactions between parents and children; interactions in instructional settings, from elementary schools to universities (Ciliberti and Anderson 1999; Ciliberti, Pugliese Anderson 2003; Anderson 2004); therapeutic encounters with couples (Anderson 2000); the latter category includes not only contexts such as talk shows, political debates (Anderson 2004) and theatrical performances, in which the presence of an audience is presupposed, but also - given the well-known ‘observer’s paradox’ - ethnographic research contexts (Ciliberti, 2007). Both <b>macro-contexts</b> are found to contain a high concentration of MPCs. In explicating why this is so, we draw on both Levinson’s (1988) notion of reception roles and on pragmatic and interactional analyses of how knowledge is made accessible in ongoing talk (Clark/Carlson 1982; Clark 1993; Gumperz 1989). In section 2 and 3, variation within educational and media discourse is respectively explored. In ‘educational’ contexts, a comparison of interactions in primary schools and in university settings shows that in the latter setting MPCs are less common, a finding we claim is related to the reduced asymmetry typical of higher education, which makes the socializing function of MPCs much less relevant. In university seminars the scope of prospective (i. e. forward-oriented) MPCs by students and teachers is differs, with those of teachers used to ‘reserve’ an extended turn at talk. MPCs in family interaction tends to be prescriptive (when used prospectively) and evaluative (when used retrospectively); in therapeutic contexts they are rigorously retrospective and are phrased as reformulations upon which the patients/clients are invited to reflect. Thus both the quantity and sequential positioning of MPCs are found to reflect the situated purposes to which they are put. The analysis of MPGs in ‘media’ contexts shows that their primary function is to provide an explanatory or interpretative key to what is going on, in order to guide the listener(s) towards a certain reading of the talk-in-progress; as ‘media’ discourse is inherently multiparty, MPCs also carry out a function of ‘targeting’ specific recipients. In both talk shows and political debates, retrospective-oriented MPCs are used to categorise contributions by other participants, usually negatively; an analysis of a theatre text (from Shakespeare’s Tempest) illustrates how the explanatory/interpretative function of MPCs cuts across both spontaneous and scripted media discourse. In closing, we argue that, although the two types of contexts differ in many ways, they share a common characteristic: an asymmetry of knowledge - real or supposed - between participants. A constitutive feature of educational contexts is the difference in knowledge levels between educators and learners; a constitutive feature of ‘media’ contexts, which are articulated along a dual communicative axis, is the impossibility of verifying to what extent knowledge is shared or not. In both <b>macro-contexts,</b> where a shared understanding does not exist, is not presupposed or cannot be verified, speakers use MPCs to facilitate the work of other participants in the interaction.

40|$|This {{cumulative}} dissertation presents five empirical papers {{dealing with}} behavioural, emotional, and contextual correlates of visual functioning in old age, and one empirical paper focusing on social context in middle and old age in general. Results {{are based on}} different samples of older adults. In study 1, the sample was comprised of older adults suffering from pathological age-related visual impairment. Moreover, a sighted control group was included. In study 2 to study 5, the samples were comprised of older adults with normal age-related changes in vision by the majority, but also included cases with excellent vision as well as cases of severe vision loss. Finally, study 6 employed two cohorts of middle-aged and older visually intact adults. Overall, findings from the presented studies show that age-related vision loss, when considered separately, results in lessened levels of behavioural and emotional outcomes that persist or develop over time. Also, mediators (e. g., outdoor motivation, social resources) and moderators (assimilative and accommodative self-regulation tendencies) {{of the relationship between}} age-related visual decline and behavioural competence and emotional adaptation, respectively, were identified. Depending on these mediators and moderators, psychosocial consequences of visual decline can be quite different. Further, context-independent correlates of age-related visual decline were found (e. g., age, cognitive functioning), but also correlation patterns that were different between <b>macro-contexts</b> (urban vs. rural areas, East vs. West Germany). In particular, social resources were more effective in enhancing out-of-home leisure activities in rural than in urban regions. The general importance of social relationships for major aging outcomes led to a focused analysis of friendships independent of visual functioning in the final study. Results highlight the importance of different personality resources for friendship involvement in different phases of life. Biographical relationship experiences appeared to be crucial as well...|$|R
40|$|This short {{statement}} {{has three}} aims. First, {{it suggests that}} rules and institutionsare a convenient and productive entrypoint for analysing capitalism and mainstream proposals for its reform. But it also suggests that analyses cannot stop there if adequate critiques and alternative strategies are to be developed. Above {{all we need to}} move beyond rules and institutions to examine the microfoundations of institutions in particular subjectivities, cognitive frames, modes of calculation, norms of conduct, and forms of embodiment; and to study the <b>macro-contexts</b> that emerge from interaction among institutions and shape this interaction in a complex dialectic of path-shaping and path-dependency. It also suggests how to move beyond rules and institutions. Second, this statement proposes a distinctive theoretical approach based on a combination of trans- and post-disciplinary modes of inquiry. It argues that these can inform both our collective intellectual endeavours and also provide the basis for a critical popular pedagogy. And, third, it identifies some key issues for a research agenda on the political and ethical dimensions of contemporary economic activities. In the spirit of the PEKEA project, our statement is not concerned to provide yet another critique of orthodox economics (for which, see Hodgson 1989; North 1990; Rutherford 1994). Instead we emphasize the socially embedded, socially regularized nature of market economies and address changing economic norms and modes of calculation. This leads us to approach capitalism very broadly in terms of the overall ensemble of socially embedded, socially regularized and strategically selective institutions, organizations, social forces and actions that are involved in sustaining the wage-relation, a labour process and more general system of production organized in terms of profitand- loss, and a complex balance between competition and cooperation among different capitals. Seen in these terms capitalist relations of production are not just economic but is also (always, necessarily) extra-economic. In pursuing these ideas should help to provide a clearer account of the inherently political aspects of contemporary capitalism...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{is concerned with}} exploring the notion of 'international-mindedness' (IM), a concept that has been largely associated with international schools and explanations for their prevalence and function within a global society. Firstly, the study seeks to present a descriptive ethnographic account based on the experiences {{of a group of}} multi-ethnic children and a teacher in a grade four classroom of an international school in Kuwait. By shadowing participants for a school year, and consulting parents of the three focal students, this thesis aims to construct a detailed ethnography of the micro-politics of classroom experiences {{within the context of the}} largescale 'macro' dimensions underpinning Class 4 A. Secondly, through a Bourdieusian framework, coupled with theoretical and methodological approaches to discourse analysis, this exploratory investigation constructs an understanding of IM as a three mode concept: outcome, process and relationship. This thesis presents the situated, discursive and dialectical dynamics organising IM through detailed observation of classroom interactions, and individual and group interviews. This research falls into two stages in its exploration of IM. Firstly, unstructured observation of the everyday realities of life in an international classroom and participants' accounts were depicted through the Bourdieusian theoretical lens of habitus, field and capital. This identified the school's American as opposed to international ethos. It also identified racial categorisation, 'American' and 'nonAmerican', and 'Kuwaitness' and 'Foreignness', as operative discourses in the classroom. Secondly, focused and structured observation of the teacher and three focal students' interactions in the classroom examined the nature of their cultural identities and intercultural conversations as precursors for IM. This stage also involved interviewing the young participants' parents in order to trace the constructions of their ethnic habitus. Participants were identified as social agents with potential to enact their own racialised discourses, in spite of the American hegemonic veneer of the international school. Further analysis revealed intersections and divergences that created cultural dialogues, in spite of the apparent and overbearing influences of the <b>macro-contexts</b> of the school and local society. In this way, this thesis arrives at an understanding of IM in Class 4 A as a dialectical relationship set against a backdrop of structural effects from the singular discourses of America and Kuwait...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} ten years, the number of English cram schools has tripled in Taiwan and more than 70 % of fifth and sixth graders claim they {{attended}} cram schools before receiving formal English education in primary schools. In response to pressures of both globalisation and localisation, the government introduced a school policy of learning a Taiwanese minority language, in addition to Mandarin, in 2005. The majority of parents, however, are not keen to encourage their children to learn a Taiwanese second language compared to the ‘trend’ of learning English (as a foreign language). This study explores family language policies using a multiple-case-study strategy with twelve families whose children attend a language school in Taichung, Taiwan, with two additional cases from different geolinguistic areas. The main focus is on how parents form their ideologies about language and language learning. The data were gathered using semi-structured interviews. The macro- and micro-factors which underpin the parents’ language ideologies are the central focus of analysis. Amongst these families the process of ideology formation involves more than three languages, English, Mandarin, Minnan and Hakfa (which, in this study, is the only representative of other minority languages spoken in Taiwan). The three Chinese languages appear as ‘mother tongue’ in various combinations amongst the parents in the study. The findings indicate that the influence of macro- and micro-factors on parents’ language ideologies is complex and interactive, rather than linear. Significant macro-factors identified include the local, national and global sociolinguistic environments, government policies and economic factors, notably the labour market. Macro-factors, as well as micro-factors, do not influence parents’ ideologies in isolation from each other. Similar, shared <b>macro-contexts</b> are responded to in diverse ways by the parents in the study, with familial mother tongue, educational experiences and different perceptions of the social roles of language all playing a part. Parents’ language ideologies are, therefore, clearly not structurally determined, but neither do the parents act as ‘free agents’ in their ideological choices which, in turn, {{have an impact on}} family language management and language practices. The complexity and fluidity of the Taiwanese language situation and the rapid social, political and economic changes that are taking place in the community make this study particularly valuable in enhancing our understanding of how personal language ideologies evolve.

The present study draws on dialogues about future plans and route directions between advanced NNSs and a single native speaker (EVA). It is hypothesized that a NNS needs more time to construct utterances because her/his level of fluency has not reached the level of automatization that a native speaker (henceforth NS) possesses. A NNS, therefore, takes advantage of the interlocutor's turn to acquire the necessary tools to continue the dialogue and to gain time, using interactional strategies such as repetition, co-construction, metalinguistic asides and trailing-offs. Furthermore, the route-direction frame is more rigid than the future plan frame, due to the more complex <b>macro-context.</b> Thus, the more difficult the communicative task, {{the more likely it is}} that the NNS will use interactional strategies as scaffolding devices.

Combining pragmatics and conversation analysis, the paper identifies patterns of turn-taking, most notably adjacency pairs, and discusses the notion of face-threatening acts in graffiti.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study {{looks at the}} leadership perceptions and practices of career professionals {{in the public sector}} across three countries of sub-Saharan Africa (Ethiopia, Ghana and Madagascar). All participants were alumni of the Humphrey Fellowship program, a year-long mid-career fellowship in the United States for professional development and leadership. The study sought to understand the participants' perceptions of leadership and how they apply it in their professional practice. The research questions were How do U. S. -trained Africans perceive the relevance of their U. S. leadership training in their home-country practice? To what extent can they incorporate U. S. leadership approaches into their leadership practice there? The literature review includes the history and current state of leadership research and theory, the field of intercultural communications and recent scholarship and program evaluations on leadership and leadership training across cultures. Noteworthy are the lack of recent scholarship on public sector leadership in Africa and the transference of western-developed models in most international training. Data collection consisted of in-depth interviews with 16 primary research participants who were mid- to upper-level career professionals in their respective countries' public service. Additional related data were gathered from participants' fellowship documents; data gathered from primary participants were reviewed with focus groups including primary and secondary participants. Data analysis followed a grounded theory method, allowing themes to emerge directly from the data collected. Findings were compared across participants within and across research sites considering professional sector, gender, cultural and educational background and political/economic contexts. The substantive grounded theories emerging from the study identified as the central theme the importance of "operating space" as an environment around individual capacity to exercise leadership practices, and its interaction with issues of culture. Results reflected the importance of the <b>macro-context</b> and levels of democratization within which participants operate on the micro-context of their own professional leadership practice.

40|$|In postcolonial {{multilingual}} societies, {{matters of}} education are {{deeply rooted in}} the discourse of ethnicity. In Malaysia, the interface between ethnicity and education is reflected in recent debates on the choice of medium of instruction (MOI). In 2002, the Malaysian government introduced English as MOI by replacing Malay, the national language, for teaching mathematics and science, at the school level. However, in 2009, the policy was reversed to Malay. This policy initiative has been actively contested in the Malaysian media. Through an analysis of news reports on the controversy published by the Malaysian Chinese newspaper, Nanyang Siang Pao, this paper aims to illustrate how a sizeable ethnic minority is able to position itself vis-à-vis a national policy. To explain the ethno-political construction of MOI debates in the newspaper, we use two concepts, namely, ‘plurality of struggles’ (Laclau, 2006 a, 2006 b; Laclau & Mouffe, 1985) and ‘transmission of the speech of others’ (Bakhtin, 1981).

40|$|Despite major {{theoretical}} {{progress in}} computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL), relatively less {{attention has been}} paid to the problem of how research advances may impact schools and classrooms. Given the global changes and educational policies for twenty-first century education, issues of how research in CSCL can be integrated with classroom practice for innovation pose important challenges. This paper draws on experiences in Hong Kong and examines research-based CSCL classroom innovations in the context of scaling up and sustaining a knowledge-building model in Hong Kong classrooms. It begins with an examination of the rationale for CSCL research in classrooms and then considers a range of problems and constraints for school implementation. Classroom innovations involve complex and emergent changes occurring at different levels of the educational system. The experience of CSCL knowledge-building classroom innovations in Hong Kong schools is reported, including: the <b>macro-context</b> of educational policies and educational reform, the meso-context of a knowledge-building teacher network, and the micro-context of knowledge-building design in classrooms. Three interacting themes-context and systemic change, capacity and community building, and innovation as inquiry-are proposed for examining collaboration and knowledge creation for classroom innovation. © 2011 The Author(s). published_or_final_versionSpringer Open Choice, 21 Feb 201...|$|E
40|$|Federal Universities {{within the}} context of Reuni are {{experiencing}} a time of great expansion and investment. In this <b>macro-context,</b> seven Ifes (Federal Institutions of Higher Education) of Minas Gerais established an agreement represented by the South-Southeast Consortium of Federal Universities with proposals for academic and administrative integration. In this respect, the action of administrators of public institutions in face of the challenge of undertaking management which ensures organizational effectiveness and efficiency, should be guided by a strategic planning tool, as represented by the Institutional Development Plan - IDP, created by Decree 5. 773 / 06. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to assess the limits and possibilities of the IDP as a management tool. The research was the application of a semi-structured questionnaire applied to teaching and technical-administrative public servants of Universities. The managers have the following challenges: improving mechanisms for disclosure and transparency, motivation of the academic community for involvement in the plan; integration of new public servants in the planning process; associating the plan to management; breaking the bureaucratic limits defined in the IDP; and interest and political support from University Administration through use of the plan as a management support tool...|$|E
40|$|The {{reference}} of hupèr eléous in Romans 15 : 9 The {{question of}} how hupèr eléous is to be understood in Romans 15 : 9 is answered with two presuppositions in mind. The letter to the Romans is understood as a paranetic reminder which culminates in 15 : 7 - 13. Furthermore {{it is argued that}} the context of this passage is the letter itself rather than a Pauline theology. The microstructure of the term is investigated to determine the resiprocal interrelationship between the term and its immediate neighbourhood. These results are used to control the presuppositions relating to the <b>macro-context.</b> The term hupèr eléous functions within the idea that Christ's acceptance of the congregation is coordinated by God's truthfulness towards Israel and his mercy towards the gentiles. This mercy of God is a new and surprising act of God, but since this mercy of God is Christ's acceptance of the gentiles, it is related to God's truthfulness to Israel which was manifested in Christ's confirmation of the promises given to the patriarchs. This has implications for the interrelationship between the church and the Jews...|$|E
30|$|Every firm {{deals with}} {{political}} and social transaction costs. Political transaction costs are one reason firms, and even whole industries, employ lobbyists. CSR {{is an example of}} a social transaction cost. CSR in this context means serving social interests without direct remuneration but which is consistent with and indirectly serves long-term investor value. There is another reason to take this seriously, namely, it often obfuscates the role of management, which is to look at a <b>macro-context</b> that includes more than markets. Most of the CSR literature fails to address the economic question of how we measure the value of CSR as opposed to the loss of resources that could have been used for other purposes, including charitable contributions by shareholders. If there is need for an empirical study it should be to determine in some fashion whether addressing social issues is done better directly by Firms or by private philanthropy. This is one issue that contrasts U.S. approaches from E.U. approaches. We should also mention that in the U.S. we have CSR corporate officers intently focused on elaborating procedures to safeguard everyone but especially the firm from legal action either on the part of the government or from frivolous law suits.|$|E
40|$|While {{the vision}} for {{restructuring}} {{health care in}} South Africa {{is based on a}} comprehensive primary health care system, care at the primary level remains largely biomedical in orientation. Given this, I argue that whilst adding mental health care to primary level care may increase accessibility of psychiatric care, it will not, however, provide for comprehensive integrated primary mental health care as planned. This would require a paradigm shift towards a comprehensive discourse of care which includes mental health care. While efforts towards reorienting health care personnel in South Africa towards the primary health care approach have been initiated, an examination of the primary health care system in one sub-district in South Africa, reveals that the delivery of biomedical care is sustained by a number of factors within the primary health care system as well as within the <b>macro-context.</b> A shift in the paradigm of care provided would therefore require the transformation of the system on many fronts. Of central importance would be the restructuring of the primary health care system to be supportive of emotional labour, health promotion, empowerment of service users and of care which takes the subjectivity of the illness experience for the patient into account.

40|$|In our {{research}} studies on Italian youths 2 ̆ 7 attitudes toward multiculturalism {{we have identified}} fear, hate, resentment, and envy among the most significant emotions underlying youths 2 ̆ 7 racism toward immigrants. The specific constituents of these emotions are analyzed {{within the context of}} cross-cultural relations and, more precisely, of youths 2 ̆ 7 attitudes toward cultural diversity. The role of the (social, political, economic) <b>macro-context</b> in, according to cases, raising, fuelling, or reducing these emotions is also considered. In particular, perception of social cohesion and of social justice appears to play a major role. What is more, it can be clearly seen that in various ways these emotions and these perceptions are related to knowledge, another element of the theoretical model I am proposing. Here knowledge embraces such conceptualizations as general information regarding immigration, the various types of social patterns provided by school and the family relating to attitudes toward multiculturalism, and the different experiences of direct contact with specific immigrants. Furthermore, also the contradictions in some youths 2 ̆ 7 racist attitudes are mentioned and briefly analyzed. Finally, educational suggestions are provided aiming to develop youths 2 ̆ 7 deeper awareness as to the various constituents of their racist attitudes and, consequently, to foster more positive attitudes toward diversity...|$|E
