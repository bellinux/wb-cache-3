40|$|In {{exploring}} the methods employed by classroom teachers of history, {{it is evident}} that a crisis exists in education that begins with the earliest teaching of history. Zhao and Hoge (2005) have noted that elementary students are incredibly bored with the teaching of history and find it to be dull and lifeless. Students in their study decried that history is dull and boring, did not apply, and was not as engaging as subjects that were more hands-on. Stoskopf (2001) identified a reason for this when he noted that the typical history curriculum was inundated with a massive number of indicators to cover, which lends itself to direct instruction.

Furthermore, we also concentrate on the relationship among the truth degree, conditional truth degree and the implicative truth degree in approximate reasoning mode. According to the truth degree in this paper, we obtain the definition of the implication measure-ment in the two-valued propositional logic system. Using the truth degree expressions of the implication measurement, we show the implication measurement expressions of the pseudo mertic which are resulted separately from the truth degree, conditional truth degree and implicative truth degree.

Hence we have achieved the transformation from the problems of approximate reasoning based on the tree kind of truth degrees as above to the approximate reasoning based on the implication measurement.
