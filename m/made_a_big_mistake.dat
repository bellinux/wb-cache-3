500|$|At Dwight's daycare, {{a poster}} for the American hip hop duo Insane Clown Posse is {{hung on the}} wall; however, Dwight has {{scribbled}} out the words [...] "Insane" [...] and [...] "Posse" [...] to make it fit into the daycare. In the episode, Dwight's subplot is inspired by as Julia Roberts's character did in the film Pretty Woman. Dwight even attempts to use Roberts's line, [...] "Big mistake", but instead renders it as [...] "You <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>mistake.</b> Huge!" [...] During Michael's counseling session, he sardonically tells Toby that he was probed by ALF, the alien star of the eponymous television series. Michael and Toby later pass the time playing Connect Four. Darryl notes to Pam that he saw a TLC show about Kate Walsh's home office, and he wants one similar.|$|E
500|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{has decided}} to boycott the Steamtown Mall after a shop owner refuses to serve him, {{going so far as}} to cancel orders to {{businesses}} there. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and the rest of the office convince Dwight to get revenge on the shop owner by making Dwight appear to be high-class, and then having him refuse to buy from the shop, a scheme the office references from the movie Pretty Woman. Using tips from the rest of the office to make himself appear more sophisticated, Dwight, with Jim and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), return to the shop. To their surprise, the shop owner immediately recognizes Dwight even in his new attire, and explains that they did not serve him before because they were intimidated by his blood-soaked hands (actually beet juice). Dwight, somewhat flustered from the truth of the situation being revealed to him, stumbles over his words before finally saying the line he had come all the way there to say, [...] "You <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>mistake.</b> Huge!", while waving his shopping bags. The group leaves somewhat embarrassed, but not before Dwight buys what he came for: a pewter wizard statuette holding a crystal ball.|$|E

He {{previously}} managed the Cincinnati Reds to the 1975 and 1976 championships, but the Reds inexplicably fired him after a second-place finish in the 1978 season.

2500|$|Following the Tunisian Revolution and the Egyptian Revolution, 4 February 2011 was {{declared}} a Day of Rage in Syria by activists through Facebook. [...] Few {{turned out to}} protest, but among the few were Kurdish demonstrators in the northeast of the country. [...] On 7 October 2011, Kurdish leader Mashaal Tammo was gunned down in his apartment by masked men widely believed to be government agents. [...] During Tammo's funeral procession {{the next day in}} the town of Qamishli, Syrian security forces fired into a crowd of more than 50,000 mourners, killing five people. According to Tammo's son, Fares Tammo, [...] "My father's assassination is the screw in the regime's coffin. They <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>mistake</b> by killing my father."

2500|$|In 2004, Crosby {{recorded}} {{bundles of}} tracks that were titled Turquoise 3.x and Crimson 3.x; {{they were released}} through an online electronic delivery outlet. Crosby solidified his band's line-up during this time, and from then on, VAST became a four-person band. With the unusual method of distribution of these tracks by a band with a relatively large fanbase formerly signed to a major label, many record companies were outraged with the releases. As a result from pressure from his former label, Elektra, Crosby was forced to sign a short-term deal with Carson Daly-owned independent label 456 Entertainment to release {{the best of both}} bundles as one album, titled Nude. This release also had the most high-quality versions of the songs, as the online releases were only available via mp3. In later years, Crosby said the idea of releasing Nude on an indie label was a [...] "nightmare" [...] because [...] "There were so many problems dealing with them (456 Entertainment) on every level. I feel we <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>mistake</b> not believing in ourselves enough and doing it on our own." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1993 was {{the fifth}} {{year in a row}} Cho would hold the Honinbo. He would get far into the Tong Yang Cup, losing to Lee Chang-ho in the final. He then became a {{challenger}} in the Kisei. A good record once more, 26 wins and 13 losses is how this year ended. He won the Kisei once more, along with defending the Honinbo again. He then won the Oza {{for the first time in}} 17 years. Cho was back to his old ways, ending the year with 33 wins and 19 losses. Cho <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>mistake</b> in the Kisei final of 1995 and lost the title. He ran away with his defense of the Honinbo for the 7th year in a row. The Oza was taken away by O Rissei, who swept Cho with a 3–0 win. The end of the year was good for Cho, winning back the Kisei—another average record of 31 wins and 25 losses. 1996 is when he held the Triple Crown once more. It was a tiring year for Cho. He played 62 tournament games, 45 of which he won. It was a truly amazing record, 45 wins and 17 losses. He kept the Triple Crown for another year. The second time, he ended with a 26–13 record. He defended his Triple Crown again with a record of 28 wins and 21 losses for the year. He finally lost his Honinbo title unexpectedly in 1999. He tried to win the Oza, but failed against a powerful O Rissei—an acceptable record with 31 wins and 21 losses. He crumbled in 2000, losing all his titles.|$|E

All the gentlemen were very quietly dressed in their habits de work. Miss Melinda De Smythe poured out tea, the domestique having refuse to get up so early after the partie of the night before. The menu was very handsome, consisting of eggs and bacon, demi-froid, and ice-cream. The conversation was sustained and lively. Mr. De Smythe sustained it and made it lively for his daughter and his garcons. In the course of the talk Mr. De Smythe stated that the next time he allowed the young people to turn his maison topsy-turvy he would see them in enfer. He wished to know if they were aware that some ass of the evening before had broken a pane of coloured glass in the hall that would cost him four dollars. Did they think he was made of argent.

All one day he stood under a tree looking out to sea, and a steamer from Capetown called, and when he heard the whistle and saw the surf boats he seemed to wake up. He walked up and down restlessly for a long time, muttering to himself. Mrs. Walsh came out to him and he was still staring at the steamer. She told him to come in out of the sun, which was very hot, but he shook his head. 'She's calling me,' he kept on saying, 'calling me!' She heard him in the room where the money was and then saw no more of him. But others saw him running to the shore, and he paid to be taken out to the steamer. They wouldn't take him on at first, because he hadn't secured a passage, but he laid down and wouldn't move. So, as he had the money, they took him, and when I heard I cabled to you. But what harm can he do, for you are his master? He is a thief and you know it. Surely you can do with him what you will.|$|R

50|$|Aina is a {{love story}} of two hearts and two souls but from two {{different}} social classes, one being a daughter of a business tycoon i.e. Rita (Shabnam) and one being a realistic, self-confident {{and a little bit}} arrogant poor young man (Nadeem). Rita is a leisure girl whereas Nadeem works as a hotel receptionist and they both fall in love. The differences between Nadeem and Rita's father Seth (Rehan) arises right from the beginning, esp. when he (Rita's father) criticised Nadeem for his social status and earning capacity, saying his daughter's sari costs 7,500 rupees as compare to his (Nadeem) monthly salary of 750 rupees. But after a struggle by Rita and a threat to her parents that she would suicide if she {{would not be allowed to}} marry Nadeem, her father agreed. So both married but Nadeem knew that Seth was not really happy with this marriage. One day Rita's mother (Bahar) came to her daughter's house, located in a middle class, and offered Nadeem a job in Seth's friend's business firm, which he denied. Not only this, he also angried on Rita about the telephone (which was thought to be a very luxurious item esp. in those days) installed in his house by her. A few days later, Rita's mother purchased furniture for Nadeem's house (perhaps to hurt Nadeem's ego) and invited her guests to a dance party in Nadeem's house.
