Police suspected Berkman, {{although there was}} no evidence, and ultimately their investigation focused on two local labor activists, Thomas <b>Mooney</b> and Warren Billings. Although neither <b>Mooney</b> nor Billings were anarchists, Berkman came to their aid: raising a defense fund, hiring lawyers, and beginning a national campaign on their behalf. <b>Mooney</b> and Billings were convicted, with <b>Mooney</b> sentenced to death and Billings to life imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Mike and Dave witness {{one of the}} klowns using shadow puppets {{to shrink}} {{a crowd of people}} into the palm of its hand, then dump them into a sack of popcorn, {{revealed}} to be sentient creatures that eagerly gobble up the human prey.

Soon after, a klown arrives at the station and <b>Mooney</b> arrests it, believing it to be a teen prankster. Dave returns to the station to find two prisoners encased in cocoons, and the now escaped klown using a deceased <b>Mooney</b> as a ventriloquist's dummy. Dave shoots the klown several times before destroying its nose, which causes it to spin wildly and explode.|$|E
