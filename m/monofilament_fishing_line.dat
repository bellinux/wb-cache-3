50|$|PVDF is {{used for}} {{specialty}} <b>monofilament</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>lines,</b> sold as fluorocarbon replacements for nylon monofilament. The surface is harder, so it is more resistant to abrasion and sharp fish teeth. Its optical density is lower than nylon, which makes the line less discernible to sharp fish eyes. It is also denser than nylon, making it sink faster towards fish.|$|R

2500|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, the {{development}} of specific angling tools for bass significantly increased angler bass catches and helped stimulate {{the development}} of the sport. [...] Some of these innovations include the invention of <b>monofilament</b> nylon <b>fishing</b> <b>lines,</b> the fiberglass (later graphite composite) fishing rod, the electric trolling motor, the fish finder/depth locator, and new artificial lures and baits made of various plastics. Recently, advanced electronics that mimic the sounds of schooling bait fish have been introduced, and a controversy has arisen over the proper use of these devices in bass tournament fishing.|$|R
2500|$|Spool {{tension on}} most modern baitcasting reels can be {{adjusted}} with adjustable spool tension, a centrifugal brake, or a magnetic [...] "cast control." [...] This reduces spool overrun during a cast and the resultant line snare, known as backlash, colloquially called a [...] "bird's nest" [...] or [...] "birdie". This backlash {{is a result of}} the angular momentum of the spool and line which is not present with a fixed spool or spinning reel. [...] Each time a lure of a different weight is attached, the cast control must be adjusted for the difference in weight. [...] The bait casting reel design will operate well with a wide variety of <b>fishing</b> <b>lines,</b> ranging from braided multifilament and heat-fused [...] "superlines" [...] to copolymer, fluorocarbon, and nylon <b>monofilaments</b> (see <b>Fishing</b> <b>line).</b> [...] Most bait casting reels can also easily be palmed or thumbed to increase the drag, set the hook, or to accurately halt the lure at a given point in the cast.|$|R

50|$|Terminal {{fly fishing}} tackle connects the fly {{line to the}} {{artificial}} fly. This is typically a tapered or level ‘’leader’’ with a ‘’tippet’’ section. Other terminal tackle may include small ‘’strike indicators’’ or weights added to the leader to assist in strike detection and presentation. The leader is a section of <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> that is attached directly {{to the end of}} the fly line. The ‘’tippet’’ section is a section of <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> attached to the leader to which the artificial fly is attached. Leaders and tippets play a key role in the presentations of the fly to the fish and the subsequent landing of a fish when caught. Leaders and tippets are generally constructed of <b>monofilament</b> or fluorocarbon <b>fishing</b> <b>line.</b> In some fly fishing situations involving toothy fish, tippets are constructed of braided or single strand stainless steel wire.|$|R
50|$|Fly lines {{consist of}} a tough braided or {{monofilament}} core, wrapped in a thick waterproof plastic sheath, often of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). In the case of floating fly lines, the PVC sheath is usually embedded with many 'microballoons' or air bubbles, and may also be impregnated with silicone or other lubricants to give buoyancy and reduce wear. In order to fill up the reel spool and ensure an adequate reserve {{in case of a}} run by a powerful <b>fish,</b> fly <b>lines</b> are usually attached to a secondary line at the butt section, called backing. Fly line backing is usually composed of braided dacron or gelspun monofilaments. All fly lines are equipped with a leader of <b>monofilament</b> or fluorocarbon <b>fishing</b> <b>line,</b> usually (but not always) tapered in diameter, and referred to by the 'X-size' (0X, 2X, 4X, etc.) of its final tip section, or tippet.|$|R

Two hooks (eyelets or screw eyes) linked to a string (usually <b>monofilament</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>line)</b> the bottom of the car prevent the vehicle from losing control during launch. In a race, a laser scanner records the speed of the car {{at the end of its}} run. Often, the dragster is carved out of balsa wood because of its light weight.|$|E
50|$|The diver's knife is a tool, not a weapon. The diver can pry and hammer {{with it as}} well as cut. It {{usually has}} one side of the blade {{serrated}} to cut heavy lines such as thick rope, and a sharper edge for fine lines such as <b>monofilament</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> and nets. There are two general styles of knife sheaths; one is flat with a spring retention and the other is tube-shaped and has an ajax triple thread, allowing the diver to insert the knife in it in any orientation. He then rotates the knife, to engage the threads and lock the knife into the sheath.|$|E

Lenny Breau also used seven string instruments, but {{whereas the other}} players all used instruments with an added bass string, Breau {{had at least one}} instrument in which the seventh string was an added treble string, tuned to the 'A' above the high 'E' string (A4). At the time he began using the high A string, no commercially manufacturered string could withstand being tuned that high, so Breau substituted a piece of <b>monofilament</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> of appropriate gauge. A year later advances in materials science allowed the La Bella company to begin manufacturing a custom string for Breau's high A.|$|E
40|$|I. Introduction — The {{need for}} a simple method of {{collecting}} botanical material from rain-forest trees became evident during {{the construction of a}} field key to the rain-forest trees of North Queensland. Many collecting techniques have been developed, e. g. throwing sticks and stones, severing branches with rifles and shotguns, felling trees with axes and saws, breaking branches with hand thrown lines and using monkeys to climb and pick twig samples. However, the collection of botanical material from rain-forest trees is a difficult and time-consuming task. The problem is not as great in forests consisting of a small number of tree species. In such forests it is generally possible to visually group the trees into species assemblages without knowing the identity of each species. When a low branched individual of a particular species is sighted, botanical material can be collected. This approach does not work satisfactorily in rain forest because of the large number of tree species and the long slender trunks on most trees. Although these trees may reach 60 m in height they usually have at least part of their crown within 20 - 30 m of the ground. II. Technique — The basic aim is to loop a strong nylon cord over a branch in the crown of the tree and to break a branch by pulling on the cord. There are two steps: 1. A lead sinker weighing 50 - 70 g, attached to a <b>monofilament</b> nylon <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> with a breaking strain of 7 to 9 kg is propelled over a branch {{with the aid of a}} catapult and allowed to fall to the ground after passing over the desired branch. 2. The sinker is removed and the end of the nylon cord is attached to the monofilament line and hauled up and over the branch and back down to the operator. One or more operators pull on both ends of the heavy cord until the branch breaks...|$|R
5000|$|DuPont {{made public}} in 1938 that their company had invented nylon. This new {{invention}} {{was the first}} synthetic fiber, fabrics that are commonly used in textiles today. In 1939, DuPont began marketing nylon <b>monofilament</b> <b>fishing</b> lines; however, braided Dacron lines remained the most used and popular <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> {{for the next two}} decades, as early monofilament line was very stiff or [...] "wiry", and difficult to handle and cast. Early monofilament did, however, have good knot strength and very low visibility to the fish, creating a small loyal following among fishermen. In 1959 DuPont introduced Stren, a thinner and much softer monofilament line {{that could be used in}} a large range of reels, including newly introduced spinning and spin casting tackle. Stren's monofilament lines soon became a favorite with many fishermen because of its overall ease of use and it spawned a whole host of imitators.|$|R
40|$|Marine debris is {{recognised}} globally {{as a key}} threatening {{process to}} marine life, but efforts {{to address the issue}} are hampered by the lack of data for many marine habitats. By developing standardised protocols and providing training in their application, we worked with > 300 volunteer divers from 11 underwater research groups to document the scale of the subtidal marine debris problem at 120 sites across > 1000 km of the coast of NSW, Australia. Sampling consisted of replicated 25 × 5 m transects in which all debris was identified, counted, and, where appropriate, removed. Sites ranged from estuarine settings adjacent to major population centres, to offshore islands within marine parks. Estuaries and embayments were consistently found to be the most contaminated habitats. Fishing-related items (and especially <b>monofilament</b> and braided <b>fishing</b> <b>line)</b> were most prevalent at the majority of sites, although food and drink items were important contributors at sites adjacent to population centres. The results identified damaging interactions between marine debris and marine biota at some key locations, highlighting the need for management intervention to ensure habitat sustainability. This study reinforces the important contribution that volunteers can make to assessing conservation issues requiring broad-scale data collection. In this case, citizen scientists delivered data that will inform, and help to prioritise, management approaches at both statewide and local scales. These initial data also provide an important baseline for longer-term, volunteer-based monitoring programs...|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} {{disintegration}} {{means that the}} plastic particulate {{in much of the}} affected region is too small to be seen. In a 2001 study, researchers (including Charles Moore) found concentrations of plastic particles at 334,721 pieces per km2 with a mean mass of 5,114 grams (11.27 lbs) per km2, in the neuston. Assuming each particle of plastic averaged 5 mm × 5 mm × 1 mm, this would amount to only 8 m2 per km2 due to small particulates. Nonetheless, this represents a high amount with respect to the overall ecology of the neuston. In many of the sampled areas, the overall concentration of plastics was seven times greater than the concentration of zooplankton. Samples collected at deeper points in the water column found much lower concentrations of plastic particles (primarily <b>monofilament</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> pieces).|$|E
5000|$|The {{main line}} of a green-sticking fishing pole {{typically}} runs over 1000 ft and will be made of 800- to 1000-pound <b>monofilament</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>line.</b> Between five and seven squid lures are then attached to this line between 35 ft and 45 ft apart. The lengths of these leader lines {{vary depending on the}} length of the pole so that as the angle of the main line [...] "details" [...] more to the water, the lures will tend to skip across its surface rather than sink beneath it. Finally, {{at the end of the}} main line is attached an artificial [...] "bird" [...] which drags about 600 ft behind the watercraft. This bird, which is about 3.5 ft long and weighs about 18 lb, is painted to resemble a small cetacean. It moves below the waterline and holds the line taught so that the lures can effectively skip over the water ahead of it. Fishermen believe that the bird creates a visual signal to passing tuna that potential food lies ahead and that they should outrun the [...] "bird" [...] in order to get it first.|$|E
50|$|The wacky rig is {{considered}} a simple but effective way to fish. Worms between four and six inches are generally used, but some use creature baits resembling crayfish and small fishes. Stick worms, those that have the same diameter throughout the length and a straight tail, are the most used, although tapered worms and tailed worms can be used. Stick worms are heavier, giving a more erratic action on the dive. Almost any hook can be used, as long as it's generally smaller than hooks used for texas rig and carolina rig, as large hooks may scare away potential bites from smaller fish. The hook is inserted {{through the middle of}} the plastic, leaving the end of the hook exposed. A thinner line than usual, from six to ten pound test, is used. Both <b>monofilament</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> and fluorocarbon may be used. These tackle heighten the chances of a bite. The two kinds of weights used are nail weights and ring weights. Nail weights are inserted through the head of the worm for different action and deeper fishing. With a nail as a weight, the lure will have an irregular action while gliding to the bottom. Ring weights are also used to fish at deeper depths, and they have the advantage of inserting the hook both through the worm and the ring simultaneously. Although fishing companies produce nail weights specifically for wacky rigging, one may use nails commonly found in tool boxes to save money. The weights allow for fishing at deeper depths, from ten up to forty feet. Any rods in general may be used. Longer rods allow for longer casts, but shorter rods give accuracy to the cast. Some anglers even use braid with a fluorocarbon leader.|$|E

Gloves, proper reel choices, goggles, guards, tension limiters, and other safety devices help to reduce accidents. Ability to de-power a kite's lift and drag is a part of sound kite systems. Tensed line can act as razors. Moving lines can cut through flesh too easily. Fatalities too often occur from kite line abuse. Keep kite lines in good condition. Realize that knots weaken kite line. Keep kite lines dry and clean. Log any wear and use of the line; replace lines as needed. Choose a safety factor when designing a line for an application. Avoid flying in the rain or stormy weather changes.|$|R

40|$|Marine debris is {{improperly}} {{disposed of}} solid waste, also called litter, which is {{deposited in the}} marine environment (NOAA, 2010). Litter prevention techniques such as fines, cleanups, incentives, and others, can help to decrease litter, and ultimately decrease marine debris. This research analyzed 2000 and 2010 International Coastal Cleanup (ICC) data obtained from The Ocean Conservancy to ascertain whether certain litter prevention techniques did reduce amounts and types of marine debris found in coastal areas. The litter prevention techniques analyzed included state bottle bills, voluntary <b>monofilament</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> recycling programs, and the Keep America Beautiful (KAB) cigarette butt litter prevention campaign. In addition, coastal population density and coastline length were also studied to uncover any potential impact they may have on marine debris amounts. This study found no significant connection between population density and kilometers of coastline and marine debris amounts. In addition, {{no statistically significant difference}} of marine debris amounts was found between states with bottle bills and without bottle bills for 2000 or 2010. Florida has the highest participation in the monofilament line recycling and was analyzed to find any difference between Florida and national averages. No significant difference was found between Florida and the national averages of fishing line debris for the year 2000 or 2010. Finally, there was no significant reduction in cigarette butt litter from 2000 to 2010 (the KAB cigarette butt litter prevention program began in 2002), but there was an increase in cigarette butts per smoker from 2000 to 2010. Other aspects that could impact marine debris amounts are also discussed to help understand the complex causes that lead to marine debris. Despite these results, the study did highlight some interesting trends. OR, LA, AL, MS, and NC had the largest decreases in marine debris per capita from 2000 to 2010, with decreases of 87 %, 79 %, 65 %, 54 %, and 52 % respectively. RI more than doubled the amount of marine debris per capita, up 52 %, from 2000 to 2010, and DE increased per capita debris 91 % in the same time period. RI and DE also saw large increases in marine debris per kilometer coastline, along with MD, over the ten year time span. In addition to population, bottle bill data also provided some interesting clues to potential marine debris reduction. There was no statistical difference between bottle bill and non-bottle states, but bottle bill states did have slightly lower amounts of returnable debris both years. Similar results were found for <b>monofilament</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> debris. There was no statically significant difference between Florida and the national average of fishing line debris, but Florida did have 92 % less fishing line debris than the national average in 2010. The cigarette butt marine debris data, analyzed to find the number of butts found per smoker, increased from 2000 to 2010, which is the opposite trend that was expected. This is most likely due to increased awareness of the impacts cigarette butt debris can have on the environment which is discussed...|$|E
