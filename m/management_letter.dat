40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades audit quality has been {{investigated}} by many scholars, although it still hasn’t been properly conceptualized and lacks one common definition. This may be explained by the constant shifting of audit theory and practice, and the complexity of the audit service. The objective of the paper is to investigate the existing definitions of audit quality, identify its main elements and provide a framework for audit quality management in audit firms. The main contribution of the paper is a developed framework for audit quality management, covering both main stakeholders of auditing triangular relationships: third-party users, as well as audit clients. Due to a slump in audit prices, complex competition and a high degree of homogeneity, the authors of the paper focus not only on external users’ perceptions, as the existing large body of literature does, but also stress audit clients’ need for satisfaction in the comprehensive framework. The framework covers various audit firms and audit engagement team factors affecting audit quality and leading to quality audit outputs: an accurate and reliable auditor report and a value adding <b>management</b> <b>letter.</b> Based on the framework presented, recommendations for future audit quality research are provide...|$|E

The auditors have expressed an unqualified opinion on the 1994 statements. Their reports on the NPOSR internal control structure and on compliance with laws and regulations, and <b>management</b> <b>letter</b> on addressing needed improvements are also provided. NPOSR consists of petroleum reserves in California and Wyoming, and oil shale reserves in Colorado and Utah. The Government`s interests in NPOSR are managed by the Department through its headquarters office in Washington, D. C. In addition, the Department has site offices in both California and Wyoming that are responsible for contractor oversight functions. Daily operations are conducted under contract by two management and operating contractors. By law, NPOSR was authorized to produce crude oil at the maximum efficient rate for six years. The law allowed production to be extended for three year periods, provided that the President of the United States certified that continued maximum production was {{in the best interest of}} the nation. The current three year period ends on April 5, 1997. Additional information about NPOSR is provided in the overview and notes to the financial statements...|$|E

As required by the 1996 National Defense Authorization Act, the Department of Energy offered NPR- 1 for sale during FY 1997. DOE structured the sale so as to offer two types of ownership segments: one operatorship segment, consisting of 74 % of the US interest in NPR- 1, and 13 nonoperating segments, each consisting of 2 % of the US interest. Potential purchasers could bid on one, some, {{or all of the}} segments. If a single purchaser wanted to buy all of the Government`s interest, then its bid would have to exceed the total of the highest bids for all of the individual segments. Bids were due October 1, 1997, at which time DOE received 22 bids from 15 parties acting alone or in concert.

In reviewing the <b>management</b> representation <b>letters,</b> we applied the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' (AICPA) Codification of Auditing Standards, AU Section 333, Management Representations; OMB Bulletin 01 - 02, Audit Requirements for Federal Financial Statements; and the GAO/President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) Financial Audit Manual (FAM) section 1001, entitled "Management Representations.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In March 2003, the Department of State (State) awarded a sole-source contract to EmbSEC, a Virginia limited liability corporation, for work at U. S. embassies. The contract currently has a ceiling price of $ 354 million. The contractor is required to install and maintain technical security equipment, such as alarms, cameras, and controlled-access equipment; establish X-ray capability for special projects; and maintain and repair physical security products. The contractor also procures equipment and materials and operates the warehouse where they are stored. EmbSEC was created as a joint venture, mentor/protege partnership under the Small Business Administration's (SBA) 8 (a) business development program. A joint venture in the 8 (a) program is an agreement between an 8 (a) participant and one or more businesses {{to work together on}} a specific 8 (a) contract.

State had awarded 8 (a) contracts to RDR for the same type of work in 1992 and 1998. We received a tip on our fraud hotline regarding the EmbSEC contract. The objectives of our review, conducted under the authority of the Comptroller General to conduct evaluations on his own initiative, were to determine (1) State's basis for awarding the contract to EmbSEC without competition and (2) the extent to which SBA has monitored the roles and responsibilities of the companies under the joint venture arrangement.

The audit also found that if there was an external cyber attack or a cyber alert issued by an Australian Government national security agency, there would be no coordinated understanding of the threat or its impact across the state’s public sector ICT systems, because central agencies do not conduct follow up actions after a cyber alert is disseminated.

30|$|We view CSR {{reports as}} a {{snapshot}} in time: {{they are an}} opportunity to commit the firm’s activities to the annals of corporate history while engaging in thoughtful reflection upon recent achievements {{at the time of}} report publication. Whether the firm exercises the option or not, firms can reflect, interpret, and re-interpret past actions {{for the benefit of the}} present-day reader. It in unreasonable to expect stakeholders to have read previous CSR reports in order to contextualize management’s present perspective. Words matter: precision in diction and consideration in presentation and structure impact stakeholder understanding, and the comparability of CSR reports both longitudinally and cross-sectionally. Care must therefore be taken in the words chosen and committed to the written page. Relatedly, <b>management’s</b> <b>letter</b> to the reader of a CSR report may articulate future expectations about objectives, processes, and outcomes (Gray et al. 1987; Wood 1991 a, 1991 b) that the firm is pursuing within the realm of responsible management behavior. When management chooses to highlight ongoing activities, they elevate the importance of these activities over competing matters that they might otherwise have raised. Thus, in the context of addressing the research questions enumerated previously, we must be sensitive to how the firm presents past actions within the context of our present conceptions.|$|R
