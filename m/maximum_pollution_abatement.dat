This paper presents some ideas {{in the use of}} optimization tools to help in the planning and control of stationary pollution sources. Three main semi-infinite programming approaches are described. The first consists in optimizing an objective function while the pollution level in a given region is kept bellow a given threshold. In the second approach the <b>maximum</b> <b>pollution</b> level in a given region is computed and in the third an air <b>pollution</b> <b>abatement</b> problem is considered.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} <b>pollution</b> <b>abatement</b> effort on the economic performances by exploiting a rich panel data set composed of French food industry firms, observed over the 1993 - 2007 period. We test the Porter hypothesis, assuming that <b>pollution</b> <b>abatement</b> effort has {{a positive effect on}} the firm performance by triggering innovation. This is done by estimating a production function augmented with knowledge capital, such a capital being produced by both <b>pollution</b> <b>abatement</b> and R&D investments. Using different estimation methods, including structural semi-parametric ones, we first show than the so-called Porter assumption cannot be rejected when focusing on the full population of French food industry firms since the estimations indicate a positive and significant (though rather small) contribution of the <b>pollution</b> <b>abatement</b> capital to the firm productivity. Then, we consider a more restrictive sample of (potentially) innovative firms, actually engaging both RD and <b>pollution</b> <b>abatement</b> investments. Henceforth, the contribution of <b>pollution</b> <b>abatement</b> capital becomes not significant in regard to the R&D’s one. These results do not support the sometimes invoked hypothesis according to which the positive effect of <b>pollution</b> <b>abatements</b> efforts on firms’ performances is linked to the induced increased innovation. At the same time, the standard hypothesis, assuming that <b>pollution</b> <b>abatement</b> effort significantly decreases the firm performance is always rejected...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{previous}} studies have demonstrated the impact of community characteristics on environmental outcomes such as local pollution levels and the siting of noxious facilities. If certain groups are indeed exposed {{to higher levels of}} air pollution, it may be due to a greater concentration of air polluters in those communities and/or facilities in those areas investing less in air <b>pollution</b> <b>abatement.</b> This paper examines the latter, using establishment-level data on manufacturing plants from the U. S. Census Bureau’s <b>Pollution</b> <b>Abatement</b> Costs and Expenditures (PACE) survey. The empirical formulation herein allows plant-level air <b>pollution</b> <b>abatement</b> operating costs to depend on an array of community characteristics common to this literature. After controlling for establishment characteristics and federal, state, and local regulation, some of these local factors are found to have had an additional effect on air <b>pollution</b> <b>abatement</b> expenditures. In particular, populations with higher homeownership rates and higher per capita income enjoyed greater <b>pollution</b> <b>abatement</b> activity from their nearby plants. Meanwhile, establishments in communities where manufacturing accounted for a greater share of local employment had less <b>pollution</b> <b>abatement</b> spending, suggesting a local constituency that is more resistant to additional regulation. Political ideology is also found to play a role, with plants in areas with larger concentrations of Democrats having more expenditure on air <b>pollution</b> <b>abatement,</b> all else being equal. There is little evidence that race and ethnicity matter {{when it comes to the}} <b>pollution</b> <b>abatement</b> behavior of the most pollution-intensive facilities.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} environmental regulation on productivity using a Cobb-Douglas production function framework. Estimating the effects of regulation on productivity {{can be done with}} a top-down approach using data for broad sectors of the economy, or a more disaggregated bottom-up approach. Our study follows a bottom-up approach using data from the U. S. paper, steel, and oil industries. We measure environmental regulation using plant-level information on <b>pollution</b> <b>abatement</b> expenditures, which allows us to distinguish between productive and abatement expenditures on each input. We use annual Census Bureau information (1979 - 1990) on output, labor, capital, and material inputs, and <b>pollution</b> <b>abatement</b> operating costs and capital expenditures for 68 pulp and paper mills, 55 oil refineries, and 27 steel mills. We find that <b>pollution</b> <b>abatement</b> inputs generally contribute little or nothing to output, especially when compared to their ‘productive’ equivalents. Adding an aggregate <b>pollution</b> <b>abatement</b> cost measure to a Cobb-Douglas production function, we find that a $ 1 increase in <b>pollution</b> <b>abatement</b> costs leads to an estimated productivity decline of $ 3. 11, $ 1. 80, and $ 5. 98 in the paper, oil, and steel industries respectively. These findings imply substantial differences across industries in their sensitivity to <b>pollution</b> <b>abatement</b> costs, arguing for a bottom-up approach that can capture these differences. Further differentiating plants by their production technology, we find substantial differences in the impact of <b>pollution</b> <b>abatement</b> costs even within industries, with higher marginal costs at plants with more polluting technologies. Finally, in all three industries, plants concentrating on change-in-production-process abatement techniques have higher productivity than plants doing predominantly end-of-line abatement, but also seem to be more affected by <b>pollution</b> <b>abatement</b> operating costs. Overall, our results point to the importance using detailed, disaggregated analyses, even below the industry level, when trying to model the costs of forcing plants to reduce their emissions.

40|$|It {{has often}} been {{asserted}} that imposition of environmental regulations in the 1970 's may be a partial explanation for the productivity growth slowdowns experienced by most industrialized countries during that decade.
