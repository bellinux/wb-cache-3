40|$|The use of alkyl- 3 -methylimidazolium {{alkylsulfonate}} ionic liquids {{for implementing}} aqueous biphasic systems is studied {{in this work}} for the first time. The ability of high charge density inorganic salts, such as K 3 PO 4, to promote phase segregation in aqueous solutions containing the ionic liquids 1, 3 -dimethylimidazolium <b>methylsulfonate</b> ([C(1) mim][C 1 SO 3]), 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium hexylsulfonate ([C(2) mim][C 6 SO 3]), 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium butylsulfonate ([C(2) mim][C 4 SO 3]), 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium <b>methylsulfonate</b> ([C(4) mim][C 1 SO 3]), 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium ethylsulfonate ([C(4) mim][C 2 SO 3]), 1 -pentyl- 3 -methylimidazolium <b>methylsulfonate</b> ([C(5) mim][C 1 SO 3]), 1 -hexyl- 3 -methylimidazolium <b>methylsulfonate</b> ([C(6) mim][C 1 SO 3]) and 1 -hexyl- 3 -methylimidazolium ethylsulfonate ([C(6) mim][C 2 SO 3]) was experimentally determined at 298. 15 K and atmospheric pressure. In general, the hydrophobicity of the ionic liquids studied {{is affected by the}} increase of the alkyl chain length. However, the position of the alkyl chain, whether in the cation or in the anion affects in a different way the lipophilic effect of the ionic liquid. Two ionic liquids with the same number of carbon atoms, the one with a longer chain in the anion is the more hydrophobic. Furthermore, four ionic liquids were chosen to extract the aminoacid L-tryptophan from aqueous solutions. The chain lengths of the anion or cation were fixed and the partition coefficients compared. The extractions, carried out at 298. 15 K, showed the good extractive power of these ionic liquids and also that the less hydrophobic ionic liquids have the better extraction coefficients. Overall, the results from this work identify relations between the length and position of the alkyl chain with the hydrophobicity and also with the extractive power of the imidazolium-alkylsulfonate based ionic liquids.

40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of (+/-) -mefloquine <b>methylsulfonate</b> monohydrate {{was determined by}} X-ray diffraction and was compared with the {{crystal structure}}s of mefloquine hydrochloride and mefloquine free base. The conformation of mefloquine was essentially the same in all three crystalline environments and was not dependent on whether mefloquine was a salt or a free base. In mefloquine <b>methylsulfonate</b> monohydrate, the angle between the average plane of the quinoline ring and the average plane of the piperidine ring was 76. 9 degrees. The intramolecular aliphatic N- 13 [...] . O- 1 distance was 2. 730 +/- 0. 008 A (1 A = 0. 1 nm), which {{is close to the}} aliphatic N [...] . O distance found in the antimalarial cinchona alkaloids. The hydroxyl group formed a hydrogen bond with the water molecule, and the amine group formed hydrogen bonds with two different <b>methylsulfonate</b> ions. The crystallographic parameters for (+/-) -mefloquine <b>methylsulfonate</b> monohydrate were as follows: C 17 H 17 F 6 N 2 O(+). CH 3 SO 3 (-). H 2 O; Mr = 492. 4; symmetry of unit cell, monoclinic; space group, P 2 (1) /a; parameters of unit cell, a was 8. 678 +/- 0. 001 A, b was 28. 330 +/- 0. 003 A, c was 8. 804 +/- 0. 001 A, beta was 97. 50 +/- 0. 01 degrees; the volume of the unit cell was 2145. 9 A 3; the number of molecules per unit cell was 4; the calculated density was 1. 52 g cm(- 3); the source of radiation was Cu K alpha (lambda = 1. 54178 A); mu (absorption coefficient) was 20. 46 cm(- 1); F(000) (sum of atomic scattering factors at zero scattering angle) was 1, 016; room temperature was used; and the final R (residual index) was 6. 58 % for 1, 740 reflections with magnitude of Fo greater than 3 sigma (F). Since the mechanism of antimalarial action and the mechanism of mefloquine resistance may involve hydrogen bond formation between mefloquine and a cellular effector or transport proteins, the common conformation of mefloquine found in each crystalline environment may define the orientation in which mefloquine forms these potentially critical hydrogen bonds with cellular constituents...|$|E

40|$|Trifluoracetic acid (TFA) {{added to}} the aqueous {{acetonitrile}} mobile phase induces some unexpected changes in the ionic component of retention in hydrophilic interaction separations when using Type B silica and amide-bonded silica columns. TFA use results in anion exchange properties which contrast with the cation exchange typically found with ammonium salt buffers. The significant cation exchange properties of silica hydride columns are also moderated by TFA. Similar behaviour was shown in a metal- free amide column operated on a system washed with a metal complexing agent, suggesting that adsorbed metal cations were not responsible for this anion exchange behaviour. Both suppression of silanol ionisation at low pH and ion pairing of bases with TFA could contribute to this effect. It {{is also possible that}} the column surface acquires some positive charges at the low pH of TFA. A surprising reversal of the properties of the columns back to predominately cation exchange behaviour was shown using methanesulfonic acid (MSA), which appears to be a stronger acid than TFA in high concentrations of acetonitrile. MSA maintains sufficient ionic strength in the mobile phase even at low concentrations, giving good peak shape, which could be useful for mass spectrometry detection. Besides giving different selectivity to TFA, MSA also gives different selectivity to that of ammonium salt buffers, suggesting it may be useful in manipulating the selectivity of a separation. Similar changes to the selectivity with TFA could be achieved by adding neutral <b>methylsulfonate</b> salts to the TFA mobile phase. While it is possible that <b>methylsulfonate</b> ions are retained on the stationary phase surface, experiments using ion pair reagents of opposite charge yielded the same results as MSA salts. It therefore seems more likely that the higher ionic strength of these solutions negates the influence of charges that may be formed in TFA solutions. Ion pairing effects with MSA are expected to be limited...|$|E
40|$|A voltage-dependent inward calcium current {{insensitive}} to tetrodotoxin has been measured in internally perfused or dialyzed squid giant axons. Sodium conductance {{was blocked by}} tetrodotoxin, and potassium conductance was irreversibly destroyed {{by the lack of}} potassium in the external and internal medium.

40|$|Snow {{samples were}} {{collected}} from a 0. 5 m snowpack at Glacier No. I and near Bogda Feng, eastern Tien Shan, northwest China. Samples that were melted in the field were analyzed for chloride, nitrate, sulfate, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and microparticles. Eight samples were returned frozen and were analyzed for the above ions plus ammonium, acetate, formate, <b>methylsulfonate,</b> and hydrogen peroxide. There {{was no significant difference}} in measured major ion concentrations between the melted and frozen samples. Measured cations in both sets of samples were two to three times greater than measured anions. Calcium and sodium are the dominant cations while sulfate is the dominant measured anion. High ion burdens are associated with dusty layers in the snowpack, indicating that dust from the vast arid regions of central Asia is the dominant source for major ions in Tien Shan snow.

40|$|Anion {{conductance}} and permeability sequences {{were obtained}} for frog skeletal muscle membranes from the changes in characteristic resistance and transmembrane potential after the replacement of one anion by another in the bathing solution. Permeability and conductance sequences are the same. The conductance sequence at pH = 7. 4 is Cl- Br- > NO 3 - > I- > trichloroacetate ≥ benzoate > valerate > butyrate > proprionate > formate > acetate ≥ lactate > benzenesulfonate ≥ isethionate > <b>methylsulfonate</b> > glutamate ≥ cysteate. The anions are divided into two classes: (a) Chloride-like anions (Cl- through trichloroacetate) have membrane conductances that decrease as pH decreases. The last six members of the complete sequence are also chloride like. (b) Benzoate-like anions (benzoate through acetate) have conductances that increase as pH decreases. At pH = 6. 7 zinc ions block Cl- and benzoate conductances with inhibitory dissociation constants of 0. 12 and 0. 16 mM, respectively. Chloride-like and benzoate-like anions probably use the same channels. The minimum size of the channel aperture is estimated as 5. 5 x 6. 5 Å from {{the dimensions of the}} largest permeating anions. A simple model of the channel qualitatively explains chloride-like and benzoate-like conductance sequences and their dependence on pH...|$|E
40|$|Human T cell hybrids were {{generated}} by fusing lectin-activated normal and leukemic human T cells with an aminopterin-sensitive human T cell line. This mutant cell line, designated CEM-T 15, {{was derived from}} the human T cell line CEM after chemical mutagenesis with ethane <b>methylsulfonate</b> and subsequent culture in medium containing 6 - thioguanine. After polyethylene glycol-induced fusion, the cells were cultured in hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine selective medium. More than 5 wk after fusion, evidence for successful hybridization was obtained by three independent criteria: (a) The majority of the cultures contained cells expressing the OKT 3 surface antigen: this antigen is expressed on normal T cells but not on CEM-T 15 cells. (b) Most of the cultures contained polyploid cells. (c) Some of the cultures provided helper activity in the generation of antibody-forming cells. This functional activity is absent from the CEM-T 15 parental cell line. Evidence for functional stability of the hybrids greater than 20 wk after fusion was provided by several clones that not only continue growing exponentially but also maintain expression of OKT 3 surface antigen and high levels of helper function. These T cell hybrids constructed using antigen-specific human T cells should be of considerable importance in further studies of the immunobiology of human T cells...|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric {{aerosols}} {{were collected}} in the boundary layer and free troposphere over continental and coastal subarctic regions of Canada during the July - August 1990 joint U. S. -Canadian Arctic Boundary Layer Expedition (ABLE) 3 B/Northern Wetlands Study (NOWES). The samples were analyzed for the following water soluble species: sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, potassium, sodium, chloride, oxalate, <b>methylsulfonate,</b> and total amine nitrogen. Ammonium and sulfate were the major water soluble components of these aerosols. The nearly neutral (overall) chemical composition of summertime aerosol particles contrasts their strongly acidic wintertime composition. Aerosol samples were separated into several air mass categories and characterized in terms of chemical composition, associated mixing ratios of gaseous compounds, and meteorological parameters. The fundamental category represented particles associated with 'background' air masses. The summertime atmospheric aerosols in background air over the North American subarctic and Arctic regions were characterized by relatively small and spatially uniform mixing ratios of the measured species. These aerosol particles were aged {{to the extent that}} they had lost their primary source signature. The chemical profile of the background air aerosols was frequently modified by additions from biomass fire plumes, aged tropical marine air, and intrusions of upper tropospheric/lower stratospheric air. Aerosols in boundary layer background air over the boreal forest region of Quebec-Labrador had significantly larger mixing ratios of ammonium and sulfate relative to the Hudson Bay region. This may reflect infiltration of anthropogenic pollution or be due to natural emissions from this region...|$|E
40|$|Changes in pH affect Cl- {{removal and}} AVP action in {{collecting}} tubules. We examined what mechanisms {{are involved in}} the alteration by chloride (Cl-) removal of arginine vasopressin (AVP) -induced cellular cAMP production, and cellular free calcium ([Ca 2 +]i]) mobilization in rat renal papillary collecting tubule cells in culture, using two buffer systems: bicarbonate and non-bicarbonate buffers. The first study was performed in the bicarbonate-supplemented buffer. Removal of Cl-, which was replaced by <b>methylsulfonate</b> or gluconate, increased cellular pH (pHi) from 7. 19 to 7. 26. AVP increased cellular cAMP production in a dose-dependent manner; 1 × 10 - 9 and 1 × 10 - 7 M AVP-induced increases in cellular cAMP production were significantly enhanced by the Cl- removal. Also, 1 × 10 - 7 M AVP-mobilized [Ca 2 +]i was augmented by the Cl- removal (181. 3 vs. 224. 5 nM, P < 0. 05). The second study was carried out with the Krebs-Ringer buffered saline (KRB). Removal of Cl- lowered pHi from 7. 20 to 7. 09. AVP-induced increases in cellular cAMP production were significantly reduced in the Cl [...] free KRB compared to those in the KRB. The reduction was obtained with KRB containing less than 25 mM Cl-. Similar results were obtained with 2 × 10 - 8 M forskolin, a diterpene activator of adenylate cyclase. 1 × 10 - 7 M AVP-mobilized [Ca 2 +]i was also diminished by the Cl [...] free KRB. These results indicate that Cl- depletion affects the cellular response to AVP mediated via the changes in pHi in renal papillary collecting tubule cells. The difference in the opposed responses is based on the activation of the Cl-/HCO 3 - exchanger in the bicarbonate-supplemented buffer, and may be based on the Cl [...] dependent H+-ATPase activation which is probably involved in the non-bicarbonate buffer system...|$|E
40|$|The {{absolute}} configuration of (−) -mefloquine {{has been established}} as 11 R, 12 S by X-ray crystallography of the hydrochloride salt, thus allowing comparison of the configuration of mefloquine's optical isomers to those of quinine and quinidine. (−) -Mefloquine has the same stereochemistry as quinine, and (+) -mefloquine has the same stereochemistry as quinidine. Since (+) -mefloquine is more potent than (−) -mefloquine in vitro against the D 6 and W 2 strains of Plasmodium falciparum and quinidine is more potent than quinine, a common stereochemical component for antimalarial activity is implicated. The crystal of (−) -mefloquine hydrochloride contained four different conformations which mainly differ in a small rotation of the piperidine ring. These conformations are {{essentially the same as}} the crystalline conformations of racemic mefloquine <b>methylsulfonate</b> monohydrate, mefloquine hydrochloride, and mefloquine free base.

40|$|Cytosolic pH (pHi) was {{measured}} in presynaptic nerve terminals isolated from rat brain (synaptosomes) using a fluorescent pH indicator, 2 ', 7 '- bis(carboxyethyl) - 5, 6 -carboxyfluorescein (BCECF). The synaptosomes were loaded with BCECF by incubation with the membrane-permanent acetoxy- methyl ester derivative of BCECF, which is hydrolyzed by intracellular esterases to the parent compound. pHi was estimated by calibrating the fluorescence signal after permeabilizing the synaptosomal membrane by two different methods. Synaptosomes loaded with 15 - 90 microM BCECF were estimated to have a pHi of 6. 94 +/- 0. 02 (mean +/- standard error; n = 54) if the fluorescence signal was calibrated after permeabilizing with digitonin; a similar value was obtained using synaptosomes loaded with 10 times less BCECF (6. 9 +/- 0. 1; n = 5). When the fluorescence signal was calibrated by permeabilizing the synaptosomal membrane to H+ with gramicidin and nigericin, pHi {{was estimated to be}} 7. 19 +/- 0. 03 (n = 12). With the latter method, pHi = 6. 95 +/- 0. 09 (n = 14) when the synaptosomes were loaded with 10 times less BCECF. Thus, pHi in synaptosomes was approximately 7. 0 and could be more precisely monitored using the digitonin calibration method at higher BCECF concentrations. When synaptosomes were incubated in medium containing 20 mM NH 4 Cl and then diluted into NH 4 Cl-free medium, pHi immediately acidified to a level of approximately 6. 6. After the acidification, pHi recovered over a period of a few minutes. The buffering capacity of the synaptosomes was estimated to be approximately 50 mM/pH unit. Recovery was substantially slowed by incubation in an Na-free medium, by the addition of amiloride (KI = 3 microM), and by abolition of the Nao/Nai gradient. pHi and its recovery after acidification were not affected by incubation in an HCO 3 -containing medium; disulfonic stilbene anion transport inhibitors (SITS and DIDS, 1 mM) and replacement of Cl with <b>methylsulfonate</b> did not affect the rate of recovery of pHi. It appears that an Na+/H+ antiporter is the primary regulator of pHi in mammalian brain nerve terminals...|$|E
