To make things worse, Liz is summoned to jury duty and cannot avoid it despite claiming to be Princess Leia. When she leaves for jury duty, she does not leave anyone in charge and allows the staff to go without direction—until later when she puts NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) in charge after learning that the staff {{have gotten out of}} hand. Liz is on a court case about a woman, named Rochelle Gaulke (Jackie Hoffman), whose work life and frustrations parallel her own; the two both have employees named Tracy and Jenna, both believe their employees waste their time, and <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> difficult.|$|E

AA shares {{the view that}} {{acceptance}} of one's inherent limitations is critical to finding one's proper place among other humans and God.

2500|$|Before {{the civil}} rights movement, the LDS Church's {{doctrine}}-based policy went largely unnoticed and unchallenged for around a century with the First Presidency stating in 1947 that {{the doctrine of the}} Church which banned interracial marriage and black people from entering the temple or receiving the priesthood was never questioned by any of the Church leaders. In 1958, apostle Joseph Fielding Smith published Answers to Gospel Questions, which stated that blacks should [...] "receive all the rights and privileges [...] as declared in the Declaration of Independence." [...] He {{went on to say that}} black people should not be barred from any type of employment or education, and should be free [...] "to <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> as happy as it is possible without interference from white men, labor unions, or from any other source." ...|$|E
2500|$|In earlier studies, {{migration}} {{is shown to}} be a risk factor in child development. On the contrary, many immigrant adolescents perform equally or even better than national adolescents, specifically in school. Reports have shown that immigrant adolescents earn better grades in school than their national contemporaries, despite their lower socio-economic status. [...] However, as immigrant youth assimilate into United States culture, their developmental and educational outcomes become less optimal. [...] This phenomenon is known as the Immigrant Paradox. [...] There are a couple explanations for this phenomenon, first of all being the free public education system of the United States. For Latino immigrants, free access to education is a major factor in deciding to immigrate to the U.S. and once they arrive, they stress upon their children the importance to succeed academically in order to <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> better. [...] Another factor increasing the initial educational success of immigrants is {{the fact that many of}} them are bilingual. Native bilingualism allows immigrants a distinct advantage in the completion of composite tasks.|$|E

2500|$|However, a {{large number}} of technologically complex devices do exist, and most of these devices exist in the Muggle world. From a certain perspective, {{it can be seen that}} Magic and {{electricity}} are the equivalents of each other in their respective worlds, but electronic equipment doesn't work around magic-filled areas, such as Hogwarts, and Muggle devices used by wizards (such as cameras and radios) can be made to function using magic instead of electricity. Such examples are rare, however; wizards rarely make use of Muggle technology, nor do they have much interest in doing so, even when such technology might <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> much easier. Pure-blood Wizards are baffled by how Muggle technology works and most have no interest in understanding it (with occasional exceptions, such as Muggle aficionado Arthur Weasley, whose dearest dream is [...] "to find out how an aeroplane stays up"). [...] "Muggle Studies" [...] classes are offered at Hogwarts for those students with an interest. On several occasions, Harry Potter is tasked with having to explain the workings of commonplace Muggle technology, such as introducing the telephone to Mr Weasley in Chamber of Secrets; at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban, Ron Weasley makes his first telephone call with disastrous results for Harry.|$|E
