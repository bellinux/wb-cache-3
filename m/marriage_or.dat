The lack of the description of formal marriage suggests, according to some critics, that Tara's relationship to Sugriva is neither widow re-marriage nor polyandry, but simply appropriation by Sugriva. In the references of the coronation of Sugriva as king, Angada is also described as the heir-apparent crown prince, while Tara is mentioned as Sugriva's wife.

Sometimes nobles married Bugis or Makassarese nobles. Commoners and slaves were prohibited from having death feasts. Despite close kinship and status inheritance, there was some social mobility, as <b>marriage</b> <b>or</b> change in wealth could affect an individuals status. Wealth was counted by the ownership of water buffaloes.|$|E

5|$|Historian Nancy Rabinowitz {{argues that}} ancient Greek red vase images portraying women {{with their arms}} around another woman's waist, or leaning on a woman's {{shoulders}} can be construed as expressions of romantic desire. Much of {{the daily lives of}} women in ancient Greece is unknown, specifically their expressions of sexuality. Although men participated in pederastic relationships outside marriage, there is no clear evidence that women were allowed or encouraged to have same-sex relationships before or during marriage as long as their marital obligations were met. Women who appear on Greek pottery are depicted with affection, and in instances where women appear only with other women, their images are eroticized: bathing, touching one another, with dildos placed in and around such scenes, and sometimes with imagery also seen in depictions of heterosexual <b>marriage</b> <b>or</b> pederastic seduction. Whether this eroticism is for the viewer or an accurate representation of life is unknown.|$|E
