40|$|Abstract Background Seafarers play an {{important}} role in the transmission of communicable diseases. The aim of the present study is to draw information and identify possible gaps on occupational health practices related to seafarers sailing on ships within the European Union Member States (EU MS) with focus on communicable diseases. Methods A structured questionnaire was sent to competent authorities from 21 EU MS. The questionnaire included questions about occupational health policies, medical certification of seafarers, communicable diseases reporting and relevant legislation. Descriptive analysis of the data was conducted by the use of Epi Info software: EU MS were categorized in four priority groups (A, B, C, D) based on: number of passenger ships visits, volume of passengers, and number of ports in each country. Moreover, EU MS were categorized to old and new, based on the date of entry in the EU. Results All 21 countries with relevant competent authorities responded to the questionnaire. The existence of specific national legislation/regulation/guidelines related to vaccination of seafarers was reported by three out of the 21 (14 %) responding authorities. Surveillance data of communicable diseases related to seafarers are collected and analyzed by 4 (19 %) authorities. Five out of 21 of the responding countries (24 %) reported that tuberculin test result is required for the issuance of seafarer's medical certificate while a great variety of medical examination is required for the issuance of this certificate among countries. Gaps on occupational health services focused on communicable diseases related to <b>maritime</b> <b>occupation</b> have been reported by 33 % of the responding countries. Responding authorities from Group A and B had the highest percentage of reported gaps followed by groups C and D. Old MS reported a higher frequency regarding gaps on occupational health services in comparison to new MS. Conclusion Our results revealed heterogeneity regarding occupational health of maritime employees in EU MS. This work provides some evidence that further work at international and European level could be considered, in order to explore the potential for harmonized initiatives regarding occupational health of seafarers. </p...|$|E

It is significant {{that there is no}} family without a sailor. Also, many Othoniotes were senior crews in war ships. Main <b>maritime</b> <b>occupations</b> was sailor, boatswain, master or engineer of any class etc. A lot of Othoniotes were ship owners as they had a large number of yachts and commercial steamships traveling to many Mediterranean ports.Unfortunately, within these decades of history that wrote Othoniotes at sea, there were some victims because of several wrecks due to sloppiness and carelessness of those responsible in the last century.|$|R

While the inland inhabitants are mainly employed within the agricultural sector, the majority of Salamis' inhabitants work in <b>maritime</b> <b>occupations</b> (fishing, ferries, and the island's shipyards) or commute to work in Athens. The maritime industry is focused on the north-east coast of the island at the port of Paloukia (Παλούκια), where ferries to mainland Greece are based, and in the dockyards of Ampelakia and the north side of the Kynosoura peninsula.|$|R
5000|$|The first tenants of {{this house}} were Ellen and Francis Cunninghame, who arrived in Australia from Glasgow on February 8, 1840 on the ship The Arkwright. Documents from that time {{indicate}} {{that he had been}} sponsored by A B Smith & Co., and lived here between 1844 to 1845. During this time, Ellen Cunninghame gave birth to two children first a son Francis and then another daughter, Ellen when living in No. 60. In 1848 Francis joined with Edward Hawskley to establish the radical newspaper The People's Advocate and Southern Vindicator. [...] The house was then run as a lodging house in 1865 by William Merchant, with most tenants being of <b>maritime</b> <b>occupations</b> due to the close proximity of Susannah Place to the docks.Dorothea, Arthur and Emmanuel Sarantides lived in this house between 1934 and 1946. Evidence of their occupancy is shown through the kitchen on the ground floor, which was recreated based on Dorothea’s grandchildren’s recollections of visiting their grandmother after school.|$|R
5000|$|The Battle of Anguilla {{had several}} {{interesting}} cultural {{effects on the}} island. Rendezvous was named {{because it was the}} site where the French held their [...] "rendezvous" [...] for the invasion. Lead sinker balls are referred to locally as [...] "bullets" [...] after the desperate attempts of the besieged militia. However, the main effect w{{as a result of the}} devastation inflicted on the plantations, in addition to the island's naturally arid climate and hurricanes doomed large scale agricultural efforts. By 1821, plantations were almost totally eliminated. Despite this, Anguillian subsistence farmers managed to grow corn, pigeon peas and other staples. The surplus of especially good yields was shipped overseas. However, as a result of the failure to maintain effectively the only profitable economy it could as a British colony it fell into poverty. Twice, in 1832 and 1843, the Governor of the Leeward Islands recommended a complete evacuation of the island and resettlement of the residents to Guyana and Trinidad. With no other alternative, the Anguillian people turned to <b>maritime</b> <b>occupations</b> - fishermen, shipwrights, riggers and traders.|$|R

60|$|Again, we endeavoured to show deductively, {{that the}} {{contrasts}} of parts first seen in all unfolding embryos, are consequent upon the contrasted circumstances to which such parts are exposed; that thus, adaptation of constitution to conditions {{is the principle}} which determines their primary changes; and that, possibly, if we include under the formula hereditarily-transmitted adaptations, all subsequent differentiations may be similarly determined. Well, we need not long contemplate the facts to see {{that some of the}} predominant social differentiations are brought about in an analogous way. As the members of an originally-homogeneous community multiply and spread, the gradual separation into sections which simultaneously takes place, manifestly depends on differences of local circumstances. Those who happen to live near some place chosen, perhaps for its centrality, as one of periodical assemblage, become traders, and a town springs up; those who live dispersed, continue to hunt or cultivate the earth; those who spread to the sea-shore fall into <b>maritime</b> <b>occupations.</b> And each of these classes undergoes modifications of character fitting to its function. Later in the process of social evolution these local adaptations are greatly multiplied. In virtue of differences of soil and climate, the rural inhabitants {{in different parts of the}} kingdom, have their occupations partially specialized; and are respectively distinguished as chiefly producing cattle, or sheep, or wheat, or oats, or hops, or cider. People living where coal-fields are discovered become colliers; Cornishmen take to mining because Cornwall is metalliferous; and the iron-manufacture is the dominant industry where ironstone is plentiful. Liverpool has assumed the office of importing cotton, in consequence of its proximity to the district where cotton goods are made; and for analogous reasons Hull has become the chief port at which foreign wools are brought in. Even in the establishment of breweries, of dye-works, of slate-quarries, of brick-yards, we may see the same truth. So that, both in general and in detail, these industrial specializations of the social organism which characterize separate districts, primarily depend on local circumstances. Of the originally-similar units making up the social mass, different groups assume the different functions which their respective positions entail; and become adapted to their conditions. Thus, that which we concluded, a priori, to be the leading cause of organic differentiations, we find, a posteriori, to be the leading cause of social differentiations. Nay further, as we inferred that possibly the embryonic changes which are not thus directly caused, are caused by hereditarily-transmitted adaptations; so, we may actually see that in embryonic societies, such changes as are not due to direct adaptations, are in the main traceable to adaptations originally undergone by the parent society. The colonies founded by distinct nations, while they are alike in exhibiting specializations caused in the way above described, grow unlike in so far as they take on, more or less, the organizations of the nations they sprung from. A French settlement does not develop exactly after the same manner as an English one; and both assume forms different from those which Roman settlements assumed. Now the fact that the differentiation of societies is determined partly by the direct adaptation of their units to local conditions, and partly by the transmitted influence of like adaptations undergone by ancestral societies, tends strongly to enforce the conclusion, otherwise reached, that the differentiation of individual organisms, similarly results from immediate adaptations compounded with ancestral adaptations.|$|R
40|$|During the 1979 summer field season archaeological {{excavations}} {{were carried}} out at three prehistoric sites along Cape Cove Beach, on the northeast coast of the island of Newfoundland. Data gathered from these sites, coupled with existing evidence, have allowed inferences to be made concerning: 1) {{the nature of the}} terminal period of the Maritime Archaic Tradition; 2) the possibility of cross-cultural diffusion resulting from contacts between Dorset Eskimo and Indian occupations in Newfoundland, between approximately 500 B. C. and A. D. 500; and 3) the origin of the historic Beothuks. [...] The Cape Cove- 1 site contained evidence of two separate <b>Maritime</b> Archaic <b>occupations.</b> The earlier of these two components represents one of the earliest known examples of human presence on the island of Newfoundland. The most significant artifacts recovered from this context are a slender chipped stone, contracting stemmed lance/spearhead, and two blade-like flakes. [...] The second occupation at Cape Cove- 1 apparently followed a c. 925 year cultural hiatus. The most notable artifacts from this context include a unifacial scraper, ground stone adzes and celts, linear flakes, and several bifacially flaked projectile points. [...] The Cape Cove- 2 site contained one major prehistoric Beothuk component. Diagnostic prehistoric Beothuk artifacts from Cape Cove- 2 included notched points, other triangular and lanceolate shaped bifaces, and scrapers. The discovery of a long rectangular sheet of birch bark in situ at Cape Cove- 2 likely represents the earliest direct evidence for the use of birch bark canoes by Beothuks. Several artifact forms, which may have been used in canoe construction, were recovered from or near various hearth features at Cape Cove- 2. These included a ground (and chipped) stone wedge, a concave knife/scraper and a bone awl or punch. [...] The Cape Cove- 3 site contained at least one feature which, according to our existing criteria, was identified as a Maritime Archaic tool manufacturing activity area. This feature contained such items as a bone scraper, an unidentified smooth oval stone, several large chipped stone lance/spearheads, and hundreds of biface thinning flakes. It {{is interesting to note that}} sites found elsewhere, with comparable artifacts, have been radiocarbon dated to periods well after the dates which were obtained from Cape Cove- 2 and the Beothuk component at Cape Cove- 3. [...] The major occupation of Cape Cove- 3 appears to have been established by members of what we presently refer to as prehistoric Beothuk culture, despite that fact that this apparent prehistoric Beothuk occupation may actually predate the so-called <b>Maritime</b> Archaic <b>occupation</b> the same site. Prehistoric Beothuk culture was indicated archaeologically by the presence of notched points, triangular bifaces, and scrapers. Also present in some of these hearth features were several miniature, expanding stemmed points, small blade cores/gravers, and tiny linear flakes. These latter items are tentatively classified as an early Beothuk 'micro-point' technology, although further research is required to firmly establish the cultural origin of these artifact forms. [...] The Cape Cove evidence as a whole indicates and supports the in situ hypothesis over the population replacement concept in the explanation of the disappearance of the Maritime Archaic Tradition and the origin of Beothuk culture. Moreover, this proposed in situ cultural transition now appears to have taken place during a period of close coexistence and cross-cultural diffusion with Early and Middle period Dorset Eskimos. Eskimo to Indian trait diffusion is suggested to account, in large part, for those differences between Late Maritime Archaic and 'proto-Beothuk' cultures which are not simply the result of continuous cultural development...|$|R
