5|$|During the British period, Sandakan grew {{quickly as}} one of the largest British {{settlements}} on the east coast of North Borneo including having been the former capital of the territory. It grew rapidly due to the export activities as a port town. The port is important for palm oil, tobacco, cocoa, coffee, <b>manila</b> <b>hemp</b> and sago exports. In the mid-1930s, the export of tropical timber from Sandakan recorded a level of 180,000 cubic metres which made the town as the world's largest exporter of hardwood. Many Sandakan wood logs are now found in Beijing's Temple of Heaven. Sandakan also enjoyed modern developments such as telegraph service to London and paved streets before Hong Kong and Singapore.|$|E

25|$|Toilet {{paper is}} a soft paper product (tissue paper) used to {{maintain}} personal hygiene after human defecation or urination. However, {{it can also}} be used for other purposes such as absorbing spillages or craft projects. Toilet paper in different forms has been used for centuries, namely in China. The ancient Greeks used clay and stone; the Romans, sponges and salt water. But according to a CNN article, the idea of a commercial product designed solely to wipe a person's buttocks was by New York City entrepreneur Joseph Gayetty, who in 1857, invented aloe-infused sheets of <b>manila</b> <b>hemp</b> dispensed from Kleenex-like boxes. However, Gayetty's toilet paper was a failure for several reasons. Americans soon grew accustomed to wiping with the Sears Roebuck catalog, they saw no need to spend money on toilet paper when catalogs for their use came in the mail for free, and because during the 19th century, it was a social taboo to openly discuss bathroom hygiene with others. Toilet paper took its next leap forward in 1890, when two brothers named Clarence and E. Irvin Scott of the Scott Paper Company co-invented rolled toilet paper.|$|E
2500|$|Hemp rope {{was used}} in the age of sailing ships, though the rope had to be {{protected}} by tarring, since hemp rope has a propensity for breaking from rot, as the capillary effect of the rope-woven fibers tended to hold liquid at the interior, while seeming dry from the outside. Tarring was a labor-intensive process, and earned sailors the nickname [...] "Jack Tar". Hemp rope was phased out when Manila, which does not require tarring, became widely available. Manila is sometimes referred to as <b>Manila</b> <b>hemp,</b> but is not related to hemp; it is abacá, a species of banana.|$|E
50|$|Synthetic rope {{can reduce}} or {{eliminate}} these issues, while providing greater strength by volume. Some riggers have complained that rope burn is more likely with synthetics, and that wear and damage on a synthetic rope is harder to detect. The two most common brands of polyester rope in the theatre world are Stage-Set X (parallel-fiber core) and Multiline II (braided strand). Over time polyester rope became more popular than <b>manila</b> in <b>hemp</b> systems and for use as the operating lines in counterweight systems.|$|R

50|$|The best rope for warps is nylon {{which is}} strong and flexible. Terylene (polyester) is {{stronger}} but has less flex. Both ropes sink, so they avoid fouling other craft in crowded anchorages and do not absorb much water. Neither breaks down quickly in sunlight. Polypropylene or polythene are not suited to warps as they float and are much weaker than nylon and only slightly stronger than natural fibres. They break down in sunlight. Natural fibres such as <b>manila</b> or <b>hemp</b> are still used in developing nations but absorb much water, are relatively weak and rot. They do give good grip and are often very cheap. All anchors should have chain at least equal to the boat's length. Some skippers prefer an all chain warp for added security in coral waters. Boats less than 8 m typically use 6 mm galvanized chain. 8-14 m craft use 9 mm chain and over 14 m use 12 mm chain. The chain should be shackled to the warp through a steel eye or spliced to the chain using a chain splice. The shackle pin should be securely wired. Either galvanized or stainless steel is suitable for eyes and shackles.|$|R
2500|$|Penn 's {{commanding}} officer, Commander J.H. Swain RN, offered Captain Mason a tow {{with a heavy}} 10-inch <b>manila</b> <b>hemp</b> rope. With the {{tow line}} in place, Penn moved ahead, straining its engines to the limit; Ohio continued to list to port. The two ships were not making any progress, even drifting backwards due to the easterly wind. Now both ships were sitting ducks, and as another serious attack developed, the destroyer went to full speed to part the tow. A German bomber dived on the tanker and was shot down by Ohio 's gunners, but just before its demise, the aircraft's crew released its cargo. A bomb hit the tanker just where the initial torpedo had hit her, effectively breaking her back, just as night was setting in. The ship was abandoned for the night. The day after, Penn was joined by the minesweeper [...] The two ships towed the tanker and succeeded in making up to five knots, overcoming the tendency to swing to port. Another attack blasted the group of ships, snapping the tow lines and immobilising Ohios rudder. Another bomb hit the fore end of the front deck, forcing the engineers out of the engine room. Once more, Mason gave the order to abandon ship, as two more air attacks narrowly missed the tanker. A superficial examination showed that the rent that had developed in the amidships section had widened and that the ship had indeed almost certainly broken her back.|$|E

40|$|Hemp is {{an annual}} crop grown for the {{production}} of fiber. It is sown in the spring like small grain and produces a thick stand of slender unbranched stalks, growing usually to a height of 6 to 10 feet. The fiber is found extending the length of the stalk, between the thin bark on the outside and the woody central pith on the inside. To obtain, the fiber the stalks are retted (partially decomposed) and then put through machines that separate the fiber {{from the rest of the}} stalk. Although hemp has been grown in the United States since early colonial days the acreage of this crop has not been very extensive. Due primarily to competition from cotton, jute, sisal and abaca (<b>Manila</b> fiber) domestic <b>hemp</b> production declined until a low of 1, 200 acres was reached in 1933. Since 1939, because of the stimulation of an increased demand due to war conditions, production has again increased. In 1942 there were about 7, 500 acres grown for fiber in Wisconsin, 5, 000 in Kentucky, 600 in Minnesota and 500 in Illinois...|$|R

Abaca is an exceptionally strong fibre, nowadays used for special papers like teabag tissue. It is also very expensive, priced several times higher than woodpulp, hence the change to that fibre for what is still called Manilla—usually with two [...] "ll"s.

50|$|<b>Manila</b> <b>hemp</b> fiber {{has been}} used as a {{substitute}} for hair. Plaster for hair slabs made with <b>manila</b> <b>hemp</b> fiber broke at 195 lb, plaster mixed with sisal hemp at 150 lb, jute at 145 lb, and goats' hair at 144 lb. Another test was made in the following manner. Two barrels of mortar were made up of equal proportions of lime and sand, one containing the usual quantity of goats' hair, and the other Manila fiber. After remaining in a dry cellar for nine months the barrels were opened. It was found that the hair had been almost entirely eaten away by the action of the lime, and the mortar consequently broke up and crumbled quite easily. The mortar containing the <b>Manila</b> <b>hemp,</b> on the other hand, showed great cohesion, and required some effort to pull it apart, the hemp fiber being undamaged.|$|E
50|$|<b>Manila</b> <b>hemp</b> {{is a type}} of buff-colored fiber {{obtained}} from Musa textilis, a relative of edible bananas, which is also called <b>Manila</b> <b>hemp</b> as well as abacá. It is mostly used for pulping for a range of uses, including speciality papers. It was once used mainly to make manila rope, but this is now of minor importance. Abacá is an exceptionally strong fibre, nowadays used for special papers like teabag tissue. It is also very expensive, priced several times higher than woodpulp. Manila envelopes and manila paper take their name from this fibre.|$|E
5000|$|Abacá ( [...] Abaka [...] ), {{binomial}} name Musa textilis, is {{a species}} of banana native to the Philippines, grown as a commercial crop in the Philippines, Ecuador, and Costa Rica.
