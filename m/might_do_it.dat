25|$|On 4 December 2009, Charlize Theron co-presented {{the draw}} for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in Cape Town, South Africa, {{accompanied}} by several other celebrities of South African origin. During rehearsals she drew an Ireland ball instead of France {{as a joke}} {{at the expense of}} FIFA, referring to the Thierry Henry handball controversy and France's controversial qualification. The stunt alarmed FIFA enough for it to fear she <b>might</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again in front of a live global audience.|$|E

But after three wins in four attempts with the 72D, he began to struggle in the new 72E that was unveiled mid-year. It resulted {{in the reverse of}} the previous year, with Stewart beating Fittipaldi for the Drivers' Championship by 16 points, though the combination of the 72D and E's points earnings were enough to gain Team Lotus the 1973 F1 Manufacturers Championship.|$|E
500|$|Lennon stated: [...] "'Imagine', which says: 'Imagine {{that there}} was no more religion, no more country, no more politics,' is {{virtually}} the Communist manifesto, even though I'm not particularly a Communist and I do not belong to any movement." [...] He told NME: [...] "There is no real Communist state in the world; you must realize that. The Socialism I speak about ... not the way some daft Russian <b>might</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> or the Chinese <b>might</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> That might suit them. Us, we should have a nice ... British Socialism." [...] Ono described the lyrical statement of [...] "Imagine" [...] as [...] "just what John believed: that we are all one country, one world, one people." [...] Rolling Stone described its lyrics as [...] "22 lines of graceful, plain-spoken faith in the power of a world, united in purpose, to repair and change itself". Some observers have described the song has having a distinctly anti-religious viewpoint, to the point that some have embraced it as an [...] "atheist anthem".|$|E
6000|$|Well, this {{blacksmith}} had a favourite maxim, {{which he}} was fond of impressing on his children. It was this--"Whatever your hand finds to <b>do,</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with all your <b>might,</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> as if to the Lord, and not to men." [...] We need hardly say that he found something like this maxim in the Bible--a grand channel through which wisdom flows to man.|$|R

500|$|Most of {{the founders}} of the CCF – {{including}} Woodsworth, Tommy Douglas, M. J. Coldwell, and Stanley Knowles,– were informed by the Social Gospel, to which Lewis, with his Marxist socialism balanced by the Bund's democratic principles, felt an affinity. Both the Bund and the Social Gospel were focused on the material present rather than the afterlife. [...] Both called on people to change their environment for the better rather than hoping that God <b>might</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for them. [...] Social justice, the brotherhood of man, and moral self-improvement were common to both.|$|E
500|$|Byard {{pointed out}} that the use of humor did not mean that his music was not serious: [...] "I <b>might</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with humor, but it's still serious because I mean what I'm doing". He stated that his choice to play in a variety of styles was not imitatory or superficial: [...] "I can't play one way all night; I wouldn't want to and I wouldn't want the public to hear me that way". One {{obituary}} writer noted that, [...] "Nobody thinks it odd if a pianist underpins melody with stride patterns or a boogie bass. When Byard did that 30 years ago, distinctions were drawn more tightly". Music writer Dan Lander also stated that Byard's playing was ahead of its time, and added that it has influenced 21st-century pianists: Byard's grasp and integration of historical forms, his ability to embrace tradition and risk taking, was visionary, impacting on a new generation of jazz musicians who understood the history of jazz as a material to build on and work with, at the service of creating something new, rather than as an unmovable weight, fixing them to the past.|$|E
500|$|In {{separate}} interviews {{early in}} 2011 both Davies brothers spoke positively about a potential reunion. Dave Davies explained, [...] "There's {{nothing in the}} pipeline yet, but... we'll see. It's possible." [...] Each has said that any reunion would be dependent on the other. According to Ray Davies, the brothers were to meet in April to discuss future plans. [...] In October that year, Dave Davies quashed rumours of a reunion, stating {{in an interview that}} although he loves his brother, [...] "I just can't stand to be with him. About an hour with Ray's my limit, so {{it would be a very}} short reunion." [...] In November of that year Ray Davies reported that he had recently recorded with Avory [...] "just to sort of try to do what we call demos... we <b>might</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in fits and starts and bring Dave in at a later date. I'll never say never with my brother, because he's totally unpredictable." [...] In a 2013 Skype interview Dave Davies expressed interest in doing reunions shows. On 18 December 2015, Ray Davies joined Dave Davies onstage at the Islington Assembly Hall in London to perform [...] "You Really Got Me". On 5 November 2016, Dave Davies posted on Twitter: [...] "Me and Ray have not spoken about Kinks shows at all– although were trying to work together on other stuff and have worked on music together".|$|E

500|$|Actors lacking {{theatrical}} experience {{needed to}} demonstrate, during their auditions, {{that they could}} also sing and dance. Chris Colfer had no previous professional experience, but Murphy wrote in the character Kurt Hummel for him. Jayma Mays auditioned with the song [...] "Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me" [...] from The Rocky Horror Show, while Cory Monteith initially submitted a tape of himself acting only, and was requested to submit a second, musical tape, in which he sang [...] "a cheesy, '80s music-video-style version" [...] of REO Speedwagon's [...] "Can't Fight This Feeling". Kevin McHale came from a boy-band background, having previously {{been part of the}} group Not Like Them. He explained that the diversity of the cast's backgrounds reflects the range of different musical styles within the show itself: [...] "It's a mix of everything: classic rock, current stuff, R Even the musical theatre stuff is switched up. You won't always recognize it." [...] Jane Lynch was originally supposed to have a recurring role as Sue Sylvester, but was made a series regular when a Damon Wayans pilot she was working on for ABC fell through. The cast is contracted for a potential three Glee films, with their contract stating that [...] " [...] hereby grants Fox three exclusive, irrevocable options to engage [...] in up to, respectively, three feature-length motion pictures." [...] Murphy said in December 2010 that he wasn't interested in doing a Glee movie [...] "as a story", and added, [...] "I <b>might</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> as a live concert thing."

2500|$|In his canonization homily, Pope John Paul II {{described}} Escrivá as [...] "a master in {{the practice}} of prayer, which he considered to be an extraordinary 'weapon' to redeem the world...It is not a paradox but a perennial truth; the fruitfulness of the apostolate lies above all in prayer and in intense and constant sacramental life." [...] In John Paul II's Decree of Canonization, he refers to the five brief prayers or aspirations of Escrivá through which [...] "one can trace the entire life story of Blessed Josemaría Escrivá. He was barely sixteen when he began to recite the first two aspirations , as soon as he had the first inklings of God's call. They expressed the burning desire of his heart: to see what God was asking of him, so that he <b>might</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> without delay, lovingly fulfilling the Lord's will. The third aspiration [...] appears frequently in his writings as a young priest and shows how his zeal to win souls for God went hand in hand with both a firm determination to be faithful to the Church and an ardent devotion to Mary, the Virgin Mother of God. Regnare Christum volumus! We want Christ to reign!: these words aptly express his constant pastoral concern to spread among all men and women the call to share, through Christ, in the dignity of God's children. God's sons and daughters should live for the purpose, to serve Him alone: Deo omnis gloria! All the glory to God!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{that same}} Raw Is War at the First Union Center in Philadelphia, The Rock {{returned}} {{for the first}} time since his kayfabe suspension (in reality, he was given the [...] "suspension" [...] to film The Scorpion King) on the April 2 episode of Raw Is War. Shane, Stephanie, and Vince McMahon were in the ring that night, trying to convince The Rock to join them. Shane reminded The Rock of how Vince screwed him out of the WWF Championship earlier that year at WrestleMania and also in a steel cage match the day after WrestleMania. Vince conceded that it was wrong for him to back Austin, as he was a rattlesnake that he should have known would eventually bite him. He promised The Rock that he had no intention of screwing him if he returned to the WWF but also noted that he could not promise that he never would; if it was good for business, he said, then he just <b>might</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> He told The Rock that he was at least being honest with him and pleaded for The Rock to trust himself, stating that his future was with the fans and the WWF. The Rock gave Vince a Rock Bottom after some bickering between Shane and Vince, and proceeded to stare down Shane, then smile cheekily and shake Shane's hand, faking a defection to the Alliance and a heel turn – but he then proceeded to Rock Bottom him as well and give him a People's Elbow, before emphatically asserting, [...] "Finally, the Rock has come back... to the WWF," [...] thus aligning himself with the World Wrestling Federation.|$|E
