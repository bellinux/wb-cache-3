50|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} features in the Scotia plate itself is the <b>median</b> <b>valley</b> known as the West Scotia Ridge. It was produced by two plates that are no longer independently active: the Magallanes and Central Scotia Plates. The ridge consists of seven segments separated by right-lateral transform offsets of various lengths. The western region of the Scotia Plate can be dated to 26-5.5 Ma.A complex pattern of spreading prior to 26 Ma is probably present in the oldest parts of this spreading regime; i.e. west of Terror Rise (north of Elephant Island) and on the shelf slope of Tierra del Fuego. Until 17 Ma the Central Scotia Plate moved quickly eastwards, fuelled by the eastern trench migration, but both plates have moved very slowly since.|$|E
5000|$|The Terceira Rift is 550 km long, and {{represents}} the world’s slowest spreading center, with plate divergence of 2-4 mm/year. It developed from a transform fault and now {{operates as a}} hyper-slow spreading center, as recognized by the relative movement between the African and Eurasian plates. [...] There is a strong resemblance between the Terceira Rift and other ultra- or super- slow spreading ridges, such as the Gakkel Rift and the Southwest Indian ridges. In particular, high obliquity values of 40°-65°, and a magmatic segmentation wavelength of 100 km, are similar to other very slow rifts. [...] Rift valleys present along the rift are 1000-2200 m deep, and 30-60 km wide, similar to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge <b>median</b> <b>valley.</b> However, the amplitude of the Terceira Rift along-strike topography is 2000-4000 m, which is much larger than expected for ultraslow spreading ridges. [...] This irregularity {{is thought to be}} due to the association of the rift with the Azores hotspot, in combination with slow spreading rates. Slow spreading results in a strong and thick axial elastic plate, and slower volcanic extrusions from the rift zone, resulting in high topography when merged with plume-related volcanism. [...] The large volume of volcanism associated with the hotspot is mainly controlled by regional extension between Africa and Eurasia, as indicated by strikes of extension fractures. [...] Furthermore, the majority of inter-plate deformation is focused on the Terceira Rift, although a clear deformation pattern has not yet been recognized.|$|E

40|$|We {{present results}} from a seismic {{refraction}} and wide-angle experiment surveying an oceanic core complex on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 22 ° 19 ′N. Oceanic core complexes are settings where petrological sampling found exposed lower crustal and upper mantle rocks, exhumed by asymmetric crustal accretion involving detachment faulting at magmatically starved ridge sections. Tomographic inversion of our seismic data yielded lateral variations of P wave velocity within the upper 3 to 4 km of the lithosphere across the <b>median</b> <b>valley.</b> A joint modeling procedure of seismic P wave travel times and marine gravity field data was used to constrain crustal thickness variations {{and the structure of}} the uppermost mantle. A gradual increase of seismic velocities from the <b>median</b> <b>valley</b> to the east is connected to aging of the oceanic crust, while a rapid change of seismic velocities at the western ridge flank indicates profound differences in lithology between conjugated ridge flanks, caused by un-roofing lower crust rocks. Under the core complex crust is approximately 40 % thinner than in the <b>median</b> <b>valley</b> and under the conjugated eastern flank. Clear PmP reflections turning under the western ridge flank suggest the creation of a Moho boundary and hence continuous magmatic accretion during core complex formation...|$|E
40|$|Four seismic {{refraction}} lines, {{three of}} which had shots every 250 m, were shot across, along and parallel to the <b>median</b> <b>valley</b> of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 37 " N. A method has been developed for calculating {{the effect on the}} travel times of the rough sea-floor relief beneath the profiles and has been used to correct all the travel times for this effect. Most arrivals were from a main refractor of apparent velocity 5. 4 to 6. 3 km s-'; only beyond 35 km were faster arrivals observed from an 8. 09,- 36 km s- l refractor. The main refractor corresponds in depth, at least approximately, to the top of Layer 3 of the ocean basins but its velocity is significantly less than normal for Layer 3, perhaps due to dip. A study of time residuals along two profiles across the <b>median</b> <b>valley</b> indicates the presence of a 2 to 3 km wide low velocity zone (about 3. 2 km s- l) beneath the <b>median</b> <b>valley</b> floor.

All glasses define an apparent binary cotectic in the normative plagioclase-pyroxene-olivine ternary, suggesting compositional control by low-pressure crystal-melt equilibria. Correlations of FeO/MgO between pyroxene and glass and olivine and glass suggest that most crystals are in equilibrium with their liquids; a few xenocrysts depart significantly from equilibrium. Plagioclase compositions are much less well correlated with liquid composition. The total range of variation of FAMOUS basalt glasses approaches that of all glass samples from spreading centers in the Atlantic. The high FeO/MgO, high TiO 2 glasses have been thought to be typical of the East Pacific Rise, but other examples are known from the Atlantic at 22 - 23 ° N.

The {{motion in the}} SAAR is currently c. [...] westward but it was originally closer to north-south. It can be inferred, based on fracture zone topography and magnetic anomalies in the Weddell Sea, that this change in direction occurred during the Cretaceous and Cenozoic.The {{western part of the}} SAAR is dominated by the earthquake-intensive South Sandwich island arc, fore-arc, and trench. East of these structures the SAAR is composed of a series of north-south-oriented ridge crests, <b>median</b> <b>valleys,</b> and east-west-oriented transform faults.The major transform faults (from the east to the west) are the Konrad (displacement about 190 km),the Bullard (displacement more than 700 km), the Volcano (displacement about 100 km), and the southernmost South Sandwich (displacement up to 320 km) transform faults.

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 We have {{determined}} the seismic crustal {{structure of the}} northern part of the Gorda Ridge using signals generated by explosive charges and recorded on Ocean Bottom Seismometers. The shot pattern forms two parallel lines, one on the east flank and the other along the <b>median</b> <b>valley.</b> Inversion of the travel time data and synthetic modelling of the signals resulted in two compressional velocity structures: the model for the flank indicates a 1. 6 km thick upper crust characterized by high velocity gradients and 3. 6 km thick lower crust characterized by a low gradient. A sharp mantle transition exists at 5. 2 km depth with an upper mantle velocity of 7. 6 km/sec. The <b>median</b> <b>valley</b> velocity model has a thicker high gradient upper crust of 3. 0 km and a lower crust of at least 3. 5 km thickness. No upper mantle velocities were detected beneath the <b>median</b> <b>valley.</b> We have also monitored the seismicity of the ridge during 15 days with two arrays of OBS and detected 4 events/hour. Epicentral coordinates were determined for 140 earthquakes. Most of them lie within the <b>median</b> <b>valley</b> and show spatial clustering. Intraplate seismicity was also detected in the Gorda Basin with three of the earthquakes big enough to be reported by land stations. They suggest that the Gorda Plate is presently undergoing deformation. Good control over the focal depth was possible for 80 earthquakes occurring on the ridge, and there the seismic activity appears to be pervasive throughout the upper 20 km suggesting that the the brittle lithosphere is at least this thick. From the earthquake shear-wave data we have obtained a value of 1. 73 for the Vp/Vs ratio. Moments of the well constrained events derived from the spectra of the waveforms are of the order 10 ²⁰ dyne-cm and suggest an average fault width of 300 m. The refraction data is consistent with the earthquake results, and all the evidence suggests that a large magma chamber underlying the axis of spreading does not presently exist at shallow depths...|$|E
40|$|Seven Alvin dives (14 km total) and {{numerous}} deep-towed camera traverses using ANGUS and NOAA camera systems provide dense {{coverage of a}} 12 -km 2 portion of the eastern wall of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the TAG area (26 °N lat.). These data, in conjunction with recent Soviet Mir submersible data, provide important constraints on the tectonic, magmatic, and hydrothermal history of this spreading center segment. Active hydrothermal venting occurs near the junction of the <b>median</b> <b>valley</b> floor and eastern <b>median</b> <b>valley</b> wall {{and appears to be}} tectonically controlled by the intersection of major fault zones. An east-west fault-line scarp interpreted as an accommodation zone intersects escarpments associated with 020 °-trending (ridge-parallel) normal faults that bound the <b>median</b> <b>valley</b> floor. The accommodation zone permits differential extension and rotation between major crustal blocks to the north and south. On the basis of the distribution of tilted chalk beds and geochemical anomalies in sediments, this fault zone has been intermittently active for at least 5 x 104 yr. The accommodation zone has apparently provided a conduit of high permeability oriented at a high angle to the ridge axis. Observations and samples from areas surrounding active and inactive vent sites provide evidence for three distinct episodes for hydrothermal outflow driven by separate magmatic events. The geometry of this active system may have implications for the location of hydrothermal systems in active spreading regimes and for massive sulfide exploration in ophiolite terranes...|$|E
40|$|The body {{waveform}} inversion {{method of}} Nabelek (1984) {{is used to}} study the centroid depths and source properties of oceanic earthquakes.

The locations and source characteristics of oceanic intraplate earthquakes are discussed, including near-ridge earthquakes, lithospheric stress, and earthquakes in older oceanic lithosphere. The results suggest that the <b>median</b> <b>valley</b> form by the necking of a strong layer. The properties of near-ridge earthquakes support the hypothesis that thermal stress generated by diferential cooling of the plate can be stored and accumulated over millions of years.

40|$|High {{levels of}} diapycnal mixing and {{geothermal}} heating near midocean ridges {{contribute to the}} buoyancy fluxes that are required to close the global circulation. In topographically confined areas, such as the deep <b>median</b> <b>valleys</b> of slow-spreading ridges, these fluxes strongly influence the local hydrography and dynamics. Data from a segment-scale hydrographic survey of the rift valley of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and from an array of current meters deployed there during an entire year are analyzed in order to characterize the dominant hydrographic patterns and dynamical processes. Comparison with historic hydrographic data indicates that the temporal variability {{during the last few}} decades has been small compared to the observed segment-scale gradients. The rift valley circulation is characterized by inflow from the eastern ridge flank and persistent unidirectional along-segment flow into a cul-de-sac. Therefore, most of the water flowing along the rift valley upwells within the segment with a mean vertical velocity > 10 ? 5 m s? 1. The observed streamwise hydrographic gradients indicate that diapycnal mixing dominates the rift valley buoyancy fluxes by more than an order of magnitude, in spite of the presence of a large hydrothermal vent field supplying several gigawatts of heat to the water column. Hydrographic budgets in the rift valley yield diffusivity values of order 5 × 10 ? 3 m 2 s? 1, consistent with estimates derived from statically unstable overturns, the largest of which were observed downstream of topographic obstacles {{in the path of the}} along-segment flow. This suggests vertical shear associated with cross-sill flows as the dominant contributor to the mechanical mixing in the rift valley...|$|R

The main {{purpose of the study was}} to test the hypothesis that the Dellwood Knolls mark the site of a short spreading segment connected to the Explorer Spreading Segment at one end by a transform fault trending along the southwestern slope of Paul Revere Ridge; and meeting the Queen Charlotte right lateral transform fault at the other end. An analysis of more than 950 km. of continuous seismic reflection profiles, in conjunction with other geophysical data, shows that (i) the Revere -Dellwood fault zone is a dextral transform fault zone connecting the Explorer and Dellwood spreading segments. (ii) The Queen Charlotte transform fault dies out at the southeastern end of the Scott Channel near the northeastern end of the Dellwood Spreading Segment. (iii) In the channel between the Dellwood Knolls (one of two possible locations of the Dellwood Spreading Segment), the sediments and volcanic basement are cut by normal faults, a feature which is characteristic of spreading centres with <b>median</b> <b>valleys.</b> The heat flow in this channel and in the Revere - Dellwood fault zone is high. (iv) The lower continental slope sediments west of Queen Charlotte Sound is faulted and crumpled and may be the northerly extension of the Scott Islands fault, zone and a site of slow contemporaneous or recently ceased subduction. The deformation of the thick turbidite sequence in the Winona Basin may also be due to subduction. Basalt from the area is chemically intermediate between tholeiitic and alkalic types. That from the Northwest Dellwood Knolls, however, is least differentiated and less than 1 myr. old in contrast to basalt from the sediment-draped Southeast Dellwood Knolls, the latter basalt having Mn-coating up to 50 mm. thick and is thus relatively old. This suggests that spreading may be occurring at the Northwest Dellwood Knolls and not in the channel between the knolls. The texture of basalts from the Dellwood Seamount Range vary depending on size of pillow and depth below pillow surface, but the mineralogy is essentially similar. An unusual rock probably best described as a plagio-clase-olivine basalt porphyry was also recovered from the Dellwood Seamount Range. Non-volcanic rocks recovered include glacial erratics, an authigenic sandstone comprising glacial fragments in an iron-rich cement, a laminated limonitic sediment and manganese nodules. The Dellwood Spreading Segment may have originated by left lateral transcurrent offset from the Explorer Spreading Segment, the offset caused by a change in the direction of motion of the Juan de Fuca plate...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey is}} {{described}} using medium and long-range (Gloria) sidescan sonars of the Reykjanes Ridge crest between 58 and 61 degree N. The survey {{extended from the}} part of the ridge crest exhibiting a <b>median</b> <b>valley</b> to that with an axial high. An axial zone, about 13 km wide, is dominated by linear volcanic ridges striking 14 degree and believed to form over fissures running approximately normal to the spreading direction. Outside the axial zone the sea-floor morphology is dominated by inward-facing faults striking subparallel to the Reykjanes Ridge axis, and therefore oblique to the spreading direction. The strike of these faults is believed to be controlled by {{the way in which the}} strength of the lithosphere increases away from the ridge axis. The faults have an average spacing of 2. 6 km and are about 10 km long. This pattern of faulting is essentially the same as that on "normal" slow-spreading and fast-spreading ridges. The major changes observed going from the SW (<b>median</b> <b>valley)</b> part to the NE (axial high) part of the ridge are decreases in fault throws, fault-block tilts, and heights of volcanic ridges. The origins of these features are discussed qualitatively in terms of a changing temperature structure of the lithosphere along the Ridge axis...|$|E
40|$|The {{petrology}} of the mid-Atlantic ridge between 22 ° and 23 °N latitude may be {{typical of}} those {{portions of the}} ridge characterized by a linear topography parallel to the axis, a well-developed <b>median</b> <b>valley,</b> and an absence of volcanic cones. Submarine basalt lavas dredged at fifteen stations {{on the crest of}} the ridge are of three eruptive facies, all derived from essentially identical magmas; (1) pillow lavas, (2) sideromelane-rich tuffs, and (3) massive, mainly holocrystalline basalts. This association is well known from continental exposures of ancient submarine lavas. Chemically, the lavas are oceanic tholeiites and thus support the view that these low-potassium olivine basalts are by far the dominant eruptive on the deep-sea floor. In the 22 ° area, they are probably the product of voluminous fissure eruptions. The oceanic tholeiite is evidently the counterpart of the continental flood basalts, but it differs compositionally from these, especially in a lower potassium content. As a further characterization of the basalts, seven new analyses of major, minor, and trace elements are presented. Post-cooling hydrothermal metamorphism under some overburden has transformed some of these basalts into greenschists and lower-grade metamorphic rocks. New data indicate that faulting and shearing along the <b>median</b> <b>valley</b> combined with the introduction of hot, probably saline solutions were major agents in the metamorphism...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the most comprehensive}} and detailed high resolution survey of an axial volcanic ridge (AVR) ever conducted, at 45 °N on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. We use 3 m resolution sidescan sonar, deep-towed magnetic field measurements, video observations from eleven ROV dives, and two very-high-resolution bathymetry and magnetic surveys. The most recently active AVR has high topographic relief, high acoustic backscatter, high crustal magnetization and little faulting. It is sharp-crested, 25 × 4 km in extent and 500 m high, and is covered by approximately 8000 volcanic “hummocks” whose detailed nature is revealed for the first time. Each is an individual volcano ? 450 m in diameter and ? 200 m high, ranging from steep-sided (45 °) cones to low domes. Many have suffered significant flank collapse. Hummocks tend to align in rows parallel to the AVR axis, parallel to its NE-trending spurs or, on its lower flanks, sub-normal to the AVR trend. These latter are spaced 1 – 2 km apart and comprise 1 – 2 km-long rows of single volcanoes. We infer that their emplacement is controlled by down-flank magma transport, possibly via lava tubes. The AVR contains only one large flat-topped seamount. The flanking <b>median</b> <b>valley</b> floor consists of either older hummocky volcanic terrain or flat-lying, mostly sediment-covered lavas. These typically have low-relief lobate surfaces, inflation and collapse structures, and occasional lava tubes and tumuli. The AVR displays open fissures, mostly along its crest. There is direct evidence {{for only a few}} small faults on the AVR, though steep, outward-facing slopes draped by elongate pillows may be small normal faults covered by lava. The surrounding <b>median</b> <b>valley</b> floor is heavily fissured. Normal faults cut it and an older AVR, the latter displaying significant outward facing faults. High crustal magnetization, an approximate proxy for crustal age within the Brunhes, is confined to the active AVR. Magnetic palaeointensity measurements are consistent with ages up to ~ 12 ka for several samples from the active AVR and ? 12 ka for one sample from the <b>median</b> <b>valley</b> floor. This is much less than the predicted spreading age, implying distribution of melt off-axis or episodic AVR growth...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{improvements}} {{in our ability}} to enhance the resolution of satellite-derived marine gravity data (Geosat and ERS 1) from 30 - 40 km down to ~ 10 km wavelength, has provided a unique opportunity to look in detail at the complex tectono-magmatic processes involved in the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean. This improvement in resolution has been achieved by innovative research and development funded by an oil industry consortium study conducted by the Leeds University spin-off company GETECH [1 - 3]. Application of new methodologies, developed as part of the above research, can significantly improve our understanding of oceanic crust-forming processes, particularly the role of near-ridge mantle hotspots and intra-plate deformation, hitherto impossible to resolve fully with current datasets. Our current knowledge, based on existing research, indicates that slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge are strongly segmented along their axes by transform faults (Fig. 1). In the South Atlantic these transform faults are typically spaced some 50 - 100 km apart, reflect the relative plate motion directions of the newly formed crust and occur at offsets of the normal faulted <b>median</b> rift <b>valley</b> that marks the axis of the ridge. The sites of these active transforms are regions of decreased magma generation, resulting in the transform zone being starved of volcanism and expressed as a deep trough in the oceanic crust. At greater distance from the ridge crest, the transform motion ceases. This chang...|$|R

Kenya has experienced multiple aflatoxicosis outbreaks in recent years, often resulting in fatalities. However, {{the full extent}} of aflatoxin exposure in Kenya has been unknown. Our objective was to quantify aflatoxin exposure across Kenya. We analysed aflatoxin levels in serum specimens from the 2007 Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey – a nationally representative, cross-sectional serosurvey. KAIS collected 15, 853 blood specimens. Of the 3180 human immunodeficiency virus-negative specimens with ≥ 1 mL sera, we randomly selected 600 specimens stratified by province and sex. We analysed serum specimens for aflatoxin albumin adducts by using isotope dilution MS/MS to quantify aflatoxin B 1 -lysine, and normalised with serum albumin. Aflatoxin concentrations were then compared by demographic, socioeconomic and geographic characteristics. We detected serum aflatoxin B 1 -lysine in 78 % of serum specimens (range = <LOD– 211 pg/mg albumin, median = 1. 78 pg/mg albumin). Aflatoxin exposure did not vary by sex, age group, marital status, religion or socioeconomic characteristics. Aflatoxin exposure varied by province (p < 0. 05); it was highest in Eastern (median = 7. 87 pg/mg albumin) and Coast (median = 3. 70 pg/mg albumin) provinces and lowest in Nyanza (median = <LOD) and Rift <b>Valley</b> (<b>median</b> = 0. 70 pg/mg albumin) provinces.

These INA populations ranged from less than 10 to over 106 CFU/g (fresh weight) of blossoms and, in Hood River Valley orchards, generally comprised over 10 % of the total bacterial population. Populations of INA bacteria fluctuated during the year with highest levels developing on buds and flowers during the cool, wet spring, followed by a drop in populations during the warmer, drier, summer months and finally a gradual increase in the autumn. The INA bacteria persisted on dormant buds from which they again colonized young developing vegetative tissues. All INA bacteria were identified as Pseudomonas syringae. The frequency of ice nucleation at − 5 °C for these strains ranged from nearly every cell being INA to less than 1 in 107 cells. The median frequency of ice nucleation at − 5 °C was 104 cells per ice nucleus. The INA P. syringae strains from individual orchards were diverse with respect to bacteriocin typing and in ice nucleation frequency. The consistent absence of detectable INA bacteria or presence of low populations in most of the orchards surveyed during periods when critical temperatures (i. e., − 2 to − 5 °C) were common indicated a limited role for INA bacteria in frost susceptibility of most Pacific Northwest orchards...|$|R

We report microseismicity from three deployments of seismic networks at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). Two networks surveyed the MAR near 7 degrees S {{in the vicinity}} of the Ascension transform fault. Three inside corner high settings were investigated. However, they remained seismically largely inactive and major seismic activity occurred along the center of the <b>median</b> <b>valley.</b> In contrast, at the Logatchev Massif core complex at 14 degrees 45 N seismicity was sparse within the center of the <b>median</b> <b>valley</b> but concentrated along the eastern rift mountains just west of the serpentine hosted Logatchev hydrothermal vent field. To the north and south of the massif, however, seismic activity occurred along the ridge axis, emphasizing the asymmetry of seismicity at the Logatchev segment.

At shallower depth of 2 - 4 km, some earthquakes {{in the vicinity of the}} vent field showed normal faulting behavior, suggesting that normal faults facilitates hydrothermal circulation feeding the vent field. Further, a second set of cross-cutting faults occurred, indicating that the surface location of the field is controlled by local fault systems...|$|E

The new data include gravity, magnetic and seismic refraction and re£ection pro¢les collected in a grid that constrain the crustal structure as well as the re£ector geometry. A second-order axial discontinuity, which is associated with anomalous crustal structure, is located within the survey area. The westward-dipping re£ector can be traced from the Moho {{to the top of the}} igneous crust, where it coincides with a step of 800 m in the basement. This re£ector is approximately planar, with a dip of 280 + 20 Wand occurs * 8 km north of the axial discontinuity.

Consideration of the velocity structure of the Gorda Ridge, together with other information on processes involved in oceanic crustal formation, suggests a model which is consistent with current knowledge on oceanic spreading centers. In the proposed model, the rise of asthenospheric material on the ascending limb of a convection cell causes the generation of a small percentage of partial melt. The molten fraction tends to coalesce {{near the top of the}} ascending limb, forming a region of significant partial melt under the ridge crest. This molten material is the immediate source reservoir for mid-ocean ridge magmas. The geophysical expression of the reservoir is a region of low seismic velocity and low density. As the magma cools from the upper surface, heavy minerals tend to work their way downward, forming a layer of cumulate ultramafic rocks at the base of the crust, while the lighter constituents work upward to form the cumulate gabbros of oceanic layer 3. The injection and extrusion of magmatic material upward leads to the formation of layer 2. The crust under the <b>median</b> <b>valley</b> is in isostatic equilibrium with the partial melt during formation, but as it is displaced laterally from the magmatic center, the entire lithosphere becomes competent and the isostatic depth of compensation moves downward into the mantle. This is thought to cause the familiar ridge crest topography of a <b>median</b> <b>valley</b> and adjacent axial mountains observed at slowly spreading ridges. The features of this general model in the specific case of the northern Gorda Ridge between 42 °N and 43 °N have been tested by the comparison of theoretical and observed gravity and magnetic anomalies. The computation of the theoretical gravity anomaly for this model gives values which match the observed anomaly. The magnetic data show only the pattern of anomalies expected from sea floor spreading and magnetic field reversals...|$|E
40|$|Seismic {{reflection}} profiles {{across the}} Labrador Sea by Vema- 19 and Charcot-S had revealed a rugged basement topography almost entirely buried by sediments up to 2000 meters thick. It was first {{suggested that this}} was the <b>median</b> <b>valley</b> of a mid-Labrador Sea ridge where oceanic crust was generated during the last phase of opening of the Labrador Sea but which is now virtually inactive and covered by sediment. The choice of a site where basement could be dated by sampling sediments that were believed to be the same age as the basement was difficult. Site 113 was eventually chosen in a local valley 8 kilometers south of a small knoll believed, from the Vema-ll record, to be a basement high...|$|E

40|$|A {{manganese}} oxide crust from an extensive deposit in the <b>median</b> <b>valley</b> of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge {{was found to}} be unusually high in manganese (up to 39. 4 % Mn), low in Fe (as low as 0. 01 % Fe), low in trace metals and deficient in Th 230 and Pa 231 with respect to the parent uranium isotopes in the sample. The accumulation rate is 100 mm to 200 mm/ 10 million year, or 2 orders of magnitude faster than the typical rate for deep-sea ferromanganese deposits. The rapid growth rate and unusual chemistry are consistent with a hydrothermal origin or with a diagenetic origin by manganese remobilized from reduced sediments. Because of the association with an active ridge, geophysical evidence indicative of hydrothermal activity, and a scarcity of sediment in the sampling area, we suggest that a submarine hot spring has created the deposit...|$|E

Site 332 is located in Deep Drill Valley approximately 30 km west of the axis of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 36 ° 52 'N latitude. The principal goal at this site was deep penetration into layer 2 of the ocean crust by multiple re-entry.

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{distribution}} of elevations on the Earth or hypsography shows how {{more than half of the}} world ocean is dominated by deep basins (4 – 6. 5 km) covered with abyssal plains and hills. Seafl oor from 2 to 4 km depth is primarily comprised of oceanic ridge systems that spread over ~ 30 % of the seafl oor. The shallow seas and continental margins from sea level to 2 km depth cover the least amount of area and represent only ~ 15 % of the seafl oor. Superimposed on the primary features of the seafl oor landscape are secondary features such as the <b>median</b> <b>valley,</b> seamounts, and submarine canyons.

40|$|A grid of 32 across-axis {{and five}} axis-parallel {{multichannel}} seismic (MCS) reflection profiles were acquired at an axial volcanic ridge (AVR) segment at 57 ° 45 'N, 32 ° 35 'W on the slow-spreading Reykjanes Ridge, Mid-Atlantic Ridge, {{to determine the}} along-axis variation and geometry of the axial magmatic system and to investigate the relationship between magma chamber structure, the along-axis continuity and segmentation of melt supply to the crust, the development of faulting and the thickness of oceanic layer 2 A. Seismic reflection profiles acquired at mid-ocean ridges are prone to being swamped by high amplitude seabed scattered noise which can either mask or be mistaken for intracrustal reflection events. In this paper, we present the results of two approaches to this problem which simulate seabed scatter and which can either be used to remove or simply predict events within processed MCS profiles. The 37 MCS profiles show clear intracrustal seismic events which {{are related to the}} structure of oceanic layer 2, to the axial magmatic system and to the faults which dismember each AVR as it ages through its tectono-magmatic life cycle and which form the <b>median</b> <b>valley</b> walls. The layer 2 A event can be mapped around the entirety of the survey area between 0. 1 and 0. 5 s two-way traveltime below the seabed, being thickest at AVR centres, and thinning both off-axis and along-axis towards AVR tips. Both AVR-parallel and ridge-parallel trends are observed, with the pattern of on-axis layer 2 A thickness variation preserved beneath relict AVRs which are rafted off-axis largely intact. Each active AVR is underlain by a mid-crustal melt lens reflection extending almost along its entire length. Similar reflection events are observed beneath the offset basins between adjacent AVRs. These are interpreted as new AVRs at the start of their life cycle, developing centrally within the <b>median</b> <b>valley.</b> The east–west spacings of relict AVRs and offset basins is 5 – 7 km, corresponding to a life span of the order of 0. 5 – 0. 7 Myr, during which AVRs appear to undergo multiple 20 – 60 Kyr tectono-magmatic cycles. <br/...|$|E
