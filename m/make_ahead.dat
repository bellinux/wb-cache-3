Though Verne's novel was in the public domain, Fox and Allen brought legal pressure against the Woolners to drop all mention of Jules Verne from their film. The Woolner’s were also stopped from using another title for the film - Cleopatra and the Cyclops, intended to exploit the hype of Fox’s own Cleopatra (1963). Allen's film is played much more for comedy than Juran's film.|$|R
