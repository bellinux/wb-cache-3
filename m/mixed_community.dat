5|$|The Battle of Vukovar was an 87-day {{siege of}} Vukovar in eastern Croatia by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), {{supported}} by various paramilitary forces from Serbia, between August and November 1991. Before the Croatian War of Independence the Baroque town was a prosperous, <b>mixed</b> <b>community</b> of Croats, Serbs and other ethnic groups. As Yugoslavia {{began to break}} up, Serbia's President Slobodan Milošević and Croatia's President Franjo Tuđman began pursuing nationalist politics. In 1990, an armed insurrection was started by Croatian Serb militias, supported by the Serbian government and paramilitary groups, who seized control of Serb-populated areas of Croatia. The JNA began to intervene in favour of the rebellion, and conflict {{broke out in the}} eastern Croatian region of Slavonia in May 1991. In August, the JNA launched a full-scale attack against Croatian-held territory in eastern Slavonia, including Vukovar.|$|E

25|$|The {{conquest of}} the Ottoman Syria by the British forces in 1917, found a <b>mixed</b> <b>community</b> in the region, with Palestine, the {{southern}} part of the Ottoman Syria, containing a mixed population of Muslims, Christians, Jews and Druze. In this period, the Jewish community (Yishuv) in Palestine was composed of traditional Jewish communities in cities (the Old Yishuv), which had existed for centuries, and the newly established agricultural Zionist communities (the New Yishuv), established since the 1870s. With the establishment of the Mandate, the Jewish community in Palestine formed the Zionist Commission to represent its interests.|$|E

500|$|After an initial, {{disastrous}} {{experiment with}} prefab houses, construction began again in 1934 to Roosevelt's specifications, {{this time with}} [...] "every modern convenience", including indoor plumbing and central steam heat. Families occupied the first fifty homes in June, and agreed to repay the government in thirty years' time. Though Roosevelt had hoped for a racially <b>mixed</b> <b>community,</b> the miners insisted on limiting membership to white Christians. After losing a community vote, Roosevelt recommended the creation of other communities for the excluded black and Jewish miners. The experience motivated Roosevelt to become much more outspoken {{on the issue of}} racial discrimination.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} satoyama has several {{definition}}s. The first definition is {{the management of}} forests through local agricultural communities. During the Edo era, young and fallen leaves were gathered from community forests to use as fertilizer in wet rice paddy fields. [...] Villagers also used wood for construction, cooking and heating. More recently, satoyama has been defined not only as <b>mixed</b> <b>community</b> forests, but also as entire landscapes that are used for agriculture. According to this definition, satoyama contains a mosaic of mixed forests, rice paddy fields, dry rice fields, grasslands, streams, ponds, and reservoirs for irrigation. Farmers use the grasslands to feed horses and cattle. Streams, ponds, and reservoirs {{play an important role}} in adjusting water levels of paddy fields and farming fish as a food source.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{settlement}} of Syrian Jews was in Manchester, where {{they joined the}} local Spanish and Portuguese synagogues, which had a <b>mixed</b> <b>community</b> that included North African, Turkish, Egyptian and Iraqi as well as Syrian Jews. This community founded two synagogues; one (Shaare Tephillah) in north central Manchester, which has since moved to Salford, and the other (Shaare Hayim) on Queenston Road in West Didsbury, in the southern suburbs. A breakaway synagogue (Shaare Sedek) was later formed on Old Lansdowne Road with more of a Syrian flavor; it and the Queenston Road congregation later merged, while retaining both buildings. They remained known as the [...] "Lansdowne Road synagogue" [...] and the [...] "Queen's Road synagogue", after the names those streets bore in the 1930s. While there are still Sephardim in the Manchester area, a number have left for communities in the Americas. The Sha'are Sedek synagogue has since been sold, and a new synagogue with the same name is under construction in Hale, {{to be closer to}} the current centers of the Sephardic and general Jewish populations.|$|E

40|$|Since 2005, the English {{government}} {{has adopted a}} policy of regenerating disadvantaged neighbourhoods by reconstructing them as <b>mixed</b> <b>communities,</b> in which schools appealing to higher income residents are a key feature. This creates some difficulties for those concerned with social justice, who support the notion of integrated schools and neighbourhoods, but {{are concerned that the}} re-modelling of neighbourhoods and schools in this way could further disadvantage existing populations. Mix is supported but mixing is opposed. This article interrogates this 'social justice dilemma' by analysing the origins and development of the <b>mixed</b> <b>communities</b> policy. It demonstrates the distinction between the principle of mix and the policy of <b>mixed</b> <b>communities,</b> while illuminating the political and discursive processes that conflate the two. Finally the authors indicate how research can be mobilised in support of neoliberal discourses about neighbourhoods and schools and draw some broader conclusions for education research and policy...|$|R

2500|$|Its {{location}} {{near the}} Syrian border makes Antakya more cosmopolitan than many cities in Turkey. It did not attract the mass immigration {{of people from}} eastern Anatolia in the 1980s and 1990s that radically swelled the populations of Mediterranean cities such as Adana and Mersin. Both Turkish and Arabic are still widely spoken in Antakya, although written Arabic is rarely used. A <b>mixed</b> <b>community</b> of faiths and denominations co-exist peacefully here. [...] Although almost all the inhabitants are Muslim, a substantial proportion adhere to the Alevi and the Arab Alawi traditions, in 'Harbiye' {{there is a place}} to honour the Alawite saint Hızır. Numerous tombs of saints, of both Sunni and Alawite, are located throughout the city. [...] Several small Christian communities are active in the city, with the largest church being St. Peter and St. Paul on Hurriyet Caddesi. With its long history of spiritual and religious movements, Antakya is a place of pilgrimage for Christians. The city also is home to a functioning synagogue serving the Jewish community of Antakya. It has a reputation in Turkey as a place for spells, fortune telling, miracles and spirits.|$|E
60|$|The seventy young women, of ages varying in {{the main}} from {{nineteen}} to one-and-twenty, though several were older, who at this date filled the species of nunnery known as the Training-School at Melchester, formed a very <b>mixed</b> <b>community,</b> which included the daughters of mechanics, curates, surgeons, shopkeepers, farmers, dairy-men, soldiers, sailors, and villagers. They sat in the large school-room of the establishment on the evening previously described, and word was passed round that Sue Bridehead had not come in at closing-time.|$|E
60|$|In the Roman south, many, if not all, of the monasteries seem to {{have been}} planned on the regular models; but in the north, where the Irish missionaries had borne the largest share in the work of conversion, the monasteries were {{irregular}} bodies on the Irish plan, where an abbot or abbess ruled over a <b>mixed</b> <b>community</b> of monks and nuns. Hild, a member of the Northumbrian princely family, founded such an abbey at Streoneshalch (Whitby), made memorable by numbering amongst its members the first known English poet, Cædmon. St. John of Beverley, Bishop of Hexham, set up a similar monastery at the place with which his name is so closely associated. The Irish monks themselves founded others at Lindisfarne and elsewhere. Even in the south, some Irish abbeys existed. An Irish monk had set up one at Bosham, in Sussex, even before Wilfrith converted that kingdom; and one of his countrymen, Maidulf (or Maeldubh?) was the original head of Malmesbury. In process of time, however, as the union with Rome grew stronger, all these houses conformed to the more regular usage, and became monasteries of the ordinary Benedictine type.|$|E

60|$|During {{the earlier}} months of 1891 Stevenson {{was not in}} {{continuous}} residence on his new property, but went away on two excursions, the first to Sydney to meet his mother; the second, in company of the American Consul Mr. Sewall, to Tutuila, a neighbouring island of the Samoan group. Of the latter, to him very interesting, trip, the correspondence contains {{only the beginning of}} an account abruptly broken off: more, will be found in the extracts from his diary given in Mr. Graham Balfour's Life (ed. 1906, pp. 312 f.). During part of the spring he was fortunate in having the company of two distinguished Americans, the painter Lafarge and the historian Henry Adams, in addition to that of the local planters, traders, and officials, a singular and singularly <b>mixed</b> <b>community.</b> After some half-year's residence he began to realise that the arrangements made for the government of Samoa by treaty between the three powers England, Germany, and America were not working nor promising to work well. Stevenson was no abstracted student or dreamer; the human interests and human duties lying immediately about him were ever the first in his eyes; and he found himself drawn deeply into the complications of local politics, as so active a spirit could not fail to be drawn, however little taste he might have for the work.|$|E
6000|$|Any {{one can see}} {{how this}} side of the Emersonian gospel {{harmonised}} with the prepossessions of a new democracy. Trust, he said, to leading instincts, not to traditional institutions, nor social ordering, nor the formulæ of books and schools for the formation of character; the great force is real and elemental. In art, Mr. Ruskin has explained the palpable truth that semi-civilised nations can colour better than we do, and that an Indian shawl and China vase are inimitable by us. 'It is their glorious ignorance of all rules that does it; the pure and true instincts have play, and do their work; and the moment we begin teaching people any rules about colour, and make them do this or that, we crush the instinct, generally for ever' (Modern Painters, iii. 91). Emerson said what comes to the same thing about morals. The philosophy of democracy, or the government of a great <b>mixed</b> <b>community</b> by itself, rests on a similar assumption in politics. The foundations of a self-governed society on a great scale are laid in leading instincts. Emerson was never tired of saying that we are wiser than we know. The path of science and of letters {{is not the way to}} nature. What was done in a remote age by men whose names have resounded far, has no deeper sense than what you and I do to-day. What food, or experience, or succour have Olympiads and Consulates for the Esquimaux seal-hunter, for the Kanáka in his canoe, for the fisherman, the stevedore, the porter? When he is in this vein Emerson often approaches curiously near to Rousseau's memorable and most potent paradox of 1750, that the sciences corrupt manners.[8] ...|$|E

During winter, caribou exhibited significant selection for jack pine <b>communities</b> whereas <b>mixed</b> <b>communities</b> were avoided...|$|R

The first part of the article considers the policy context for <b>mixed</b> <b>communities</b> and considers the conceptual basis underlying contemporary housing management through discourses of culture and social control. The second part considers how this agenda has resulted in the adoption of intensive management strategies within mixed communities; illustrated in the development of allocation policies, initiatives designed to tackle anti-social behaviour and proposals to develop sustainable communities. The main argument is given that the concept of <b>mixed</b> <b>communities</b> is based on the premise of social housing failure, citizenship has been defined largely in response to private sector interests. This approach to management has been a contributory factor in the construction of social housing as a form of second-class citizenship. ...|$|R
