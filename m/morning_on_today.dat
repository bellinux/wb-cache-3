5000|$|On February 16, 2014, {{reporter}} and former women's silver medalist Christin Cooper received criticism for her interview with Bode Miller after his bronze medal {{win in the}} men's super G alpine skiing event. During the post-event interview, as Miller became increasingly emotional, Cooper repeatedly questioned him about his late brother Chelone, who had died the previous April {{at the age of}} 29, until Miller broke down in tears and was unable to continue the interview. For her pressing of the issue, Cooper was described as having badgered Miller. NBC also received criticism for keeping the cameras on Miller, who sagged on the railing and cried without speaking, for more than a full minute, despite having had several hours in which to edit the footage before airing it. Later that evening, Miller tweeted his fans should [...] "be gentle" [...] with Cooper, as it was [...] "not at all her fault," [...] and [...] "she asked the questions every interviewer would have." [...] The following <b>morning</b> <b>on</b> <b>Today,</b> Miller reiterated his support for Cooper, saying, [...] "I have known Christin a long time, and she's a sweetheart of a person. I know she didn't mean to push. I don't think she really anticipated what my reaction was going to be, and I think by the time she realized it, it was too late. I don't blame her at all." ...|$|E
