5|$|Swaying {{behaviour}} is practised by highly cryptic {{animals such as}} {{the leafy}} sea dragon and the stick insect Extatosoma tiaratum. These animals resemble vegetation with their coloration, strikingly disruptive body outlines with leaflike appendages, {{and the ability to}} sway effectively like the plants that they mimic. E. tiaratum actively sways back and forth or side to side when disturbed or when there is a gust of wind, with a frequency distribution like foliage rustling in the wind. This behaviour may represent motion crypsis, preventing detection by predators, or motion masquerade, promoting <b>misclassification</b> (as something other than prey), or a combination of the two, and has accordingly also been described as a form of motion camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Movement {{catches the}} eye of prey animals {{on the lookout for}} predators, and of predators hunting for prey. Most methods of crypsis {{therefore}} also require suitable cryptic behaviour, such as lying down and keeping still to avoid being detected, {{or in the case of}} stalking predators such as the tiger, moving with extreme stealth, both slowly and quietly, watching its prey for any sign they are aware of its presence. As an example of the combination of behaviours and other methods of crypsis involved, young giraffes seek cover, lie down, and keep still, often for hours until their mothers return; their skin pattern blends with the pattern of the vegetation, while the chosen cover and lying position together hide the animals' shadows. The flat-tail horned lizard similarly relies on a combination of methods: it is adapted to lie flat in the open desert, relying on stillness, its cryptic coloration, and concealment of its shadow to avoid being noticed by predators. In the ocean, the leafy sea dragon sways mimetically, like the seaweeds amongst which it rests, as if rippled by wind or water currents. Swaying is seen also in some insects, like Macleay's Spectre stick insect, Extatosoma tiaratum. The behaviour may be motion crypsis, preventing detection, or motion masquerade, promoting <b>misclassification</b> (as something other than prey), or a combination of the two.|$|E

25|$|Bradycardia {{was defined}} as a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute when {{textbooks}} asserted that the normal range for heart rates was 60–100 BPM. The normal range has since been revised in textbooks to 50–90 BPM for a human at total rest. Setting a lower threshold for bradycardia prevents <b>misclassification</b> of fit individuals as having a pathologic heart rate. The normal heart rate number can vary as children and adolescents tend to have faster heart rates than average adults. Bradycardia may be associated with medical conditions such as hypothyroidism.|$|E

The blue poppy (national flower of Bhutan) was the source of an ecological mystery for nearly a century, due to its <b>misclassification</b> as Meconopsis grandis. In 2017, after three years of field work and taxonomic studies, its classification was corrected by Bhutanese and Japanese researchers. The problem may have originally arisen due to the now understood finding that some Himalayan flora readily hybridize with each other and produce viable seeds, causing wider (and unknown) morphological diversity.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this work, we {{consider}} so-called nonredundant inhibitory rules, containing an expression “attribute:F value” on the right- hand side, {{for which the}} number of <b>misclassifications</b> is at most a threshold γ.

This approach allows also the optimization of nonredundant inhibitory rules relative to the length and coverage.

25|$|It {{should be}} noted that within choral music, singers voices are divided {{solely on the basis of}} vocal range. Choral music most {{commonly}} divides vocal parts into high and low voices within each sex (SATB). As a result, the typical choral situation affords many opportunities for <b>misclassification</b> to occur. Since most people have medium voices, they must be assigned to a part that is either too high or too low for them; the mezzo-soprano must sing soprano or alto and the baritone must sing tenor or bass. Either option can present problems for the singer, but for most singers there are fewer dangers in singing too low than in singing too high.|$|E

25|$|Patel et al. {{found that}} {{southern}} Indian states have ten times {{higher rates of}} suicides than some northern states. This difference, they claim, is not because of <b>misclassification</b> of a person's death. The most common cause for suicide in South India are a combination of social issues, such as interpersonal and family problems, financial difficulties, and pre-existing mental illness. Suicidal ideation is as culturally accepted in south India as in some high-income countries. The high suicide rates in southern states of India may be, suggest Patel el al., {{in part because of}} social acceptance of suicide as a method to deal with difficulties. Suicide ideation among surviving family members of farmers' suicide victims is another worry. Recent study shows that almost a third of suicide survivors (family members left behind) had suicide ideation in one month prior to assessment.|$|E

40|$|Spatial {{decision-making}} procedures, such as multi-criteria evaluation (MCE), often {{rely upon}} input data derived from remote sensing {{in the form}} of land cover maps. However, these data can often contain inherent errors and <b>misclassifications</b> that can influence the accuracy of the final output associated with spatial decision-making procedures. The research presented here explores what influence errors and <b>misclassifications</b> in remote sensing derived land cover data can have on the output from spatial decision-making procedures. Four land cover data layers, each covering the same spatial area and easily obtained from scholarly or governmental institutions, are used throughout this research. These comparative land cover data layers are compared with an author-created land cover data layer known as the BASE layer. The BASE layer represents the nearest approximation of the land cover condition in the study region. Overall land cover classification accuracy is assessed for each of the land cover data layers used in this research. In addition to overall land cover classification accuracy, classification accuracy is evaluated along the edge and interior of land cover regions in order to determine if the spatial location of errors and <b>misclassifications,</b> rather than the quantity of errors and <b>misclassifications</b> alone, can {{have an impact on the}} output form spatial decision making procedures. This is followed by an assessment of the influence of errors and <b>misclassifications</b> on site and situational factors, two of the primary components of spatial decision-making procedures. Direct comparisons are made between the BASE layer and the comparative land cover data layers. A series of multi-criteria evaluation procedures using the BASE layer and the four comparative data layers as input concludes this research. The output from the spatial decision-making procedure using the BASE layer is directly compared with the same spatial decision-making procedure using each of the comparative land cover data layers as input. Differences between the BASE layer and the comparative land cover data layers are then assessed to determine if errors and <b>misclassifications</b> have had an impact on the output of the spatial decision-making procedures. ...|$|R

The final paper concluded that studies like Hirayama's were subject to <b>misclassification</b> bias, and therefore, had [...] "little scientific basis". In 1995, the journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology published two studies funded by the CIAR examining the association between ETS and heart disease. Both studies concluded that ETS exposure from spouses did not {{increase the risk of}} heart disease, and that previous conclusions to the contrary were due to publication bias. Both of these studies have been criticized for suffering from exposure <b>misclassification,</b> because both studies failed to distinguish between current and former smokers. In 2003, a study funded by the center was published in the BMJ. Authored by James Enstrom and Geoffrey Kabat, the study found little association between secondhand smoke and coronary heart disease or lung cancer. This study has been criticized for failing to distinguish between those who were exposed to second-hand smoke and those who were not, because, according to the American Cancer Society, the study's participants were enrolled in 1959, [...] "when exposure to secondhand smoke was so pervasive that virtually everyone was exposed to ETS, {{whether or not they were}} married to a smoker." ...|$|E
