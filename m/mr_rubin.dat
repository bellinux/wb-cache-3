Friedman said the governmental speech-monitoring should go beyond those who actually advocate violence, and [...] include also those whom former State Department spokesperson Jamie Rubin calls [...] "excuse makers". In his July 22 column, Friedman wrote against the [...] "excuses" [...] made by terrorists or apologists who blame their actions on third-party influences or pressures. [...] "After every major terrorist incident, the excuse makers come out to tell us ... why the terrorists acted. These excuse makers are just one notch less despicable than the terrorists and also deserve to be exposed. When you live in an open society like London, where anyone with a grievance can publish an article, run for office or start a political movement, the notion that blowing up a busload of innocent civilians in response to Iraq is somehow [...] "understandable" [...] is outrageous. [...] "It erases the distinction between legitimate dissent and terrorism" [...] <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rubin</b> said, [...] "and an open society needs to maintain a clear wall between them." [...] As part of their response to this column, the editors at FAIR encouraged their readers to contact Friedman and inform him that [...] "opponents of the Iraq War do not deserve to be on a government blacklist-even if they oppose the war because they believe it encourages terrorism".|$|E

5000|$|Not all reviewers were charmed with Rubin. In a 1965 Kirkus {{review of}} Cassio the {{publication}} {{noted that the}} book is, “Inexcusably prolix, egotistical, and ponderous."

5000|$|The New York Times had a mixed {{review of}} the first program [...] "Saddam’s Ultimate Solution", {{especially}} concerning the interview of Richard Perle by host James Rubin: [...] Mr. Perle offers an argument rather than analysis when he says an American operation in Iraq will be [...] "quicker and easier than many people think," [...] {{a matter of weeks}} not months. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rubin</b> questions what he calls this [...] "optimistic scenario," [...] but because it's not his role to take a position, the Perle interview is the lopsided half of a debate. Still, in a television landscape where network news is dominated by tiny sound bites and cable by shouting heads, Wide Angle had a distinct and valuable place. Caryn James ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1935, {{the company}} was in serious difficulty. Its {{principal}} supplier of paper boxes, Joseph Rubin & Sons of Brooklyn — concerned about the possible loss of an important customer — {{became interested in the}} possibility of acquiring control. The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but Bernard D. Rubin acquired a list of shareholders and approached them in person in order to purchase their shares. The Rubins eventually achieved control and agreed that Bernard would run the company as president. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rubin</b> was able to steadily increase sales and restore profits, changing the formula of the Tootsie Roll and increasing its size, moving from Manhattan to a much larger plant in Hoboken, New Jersey, and guiding the company successfully through the difficult war years when vital raw materials were in short supply. When he died in 1948 he had increased the sales volume twelvefold. After his death, his brother William B. Rubin became president and remained president until 1962.|$|E
50|$|Mr. Foran was {{a senior}} partner in Foran & Schultz, the firm he founded in 1957. His name {{was one of the}} {{brightest}} in his city's legal profession, but to the outside world it was inextricably linked to some leading characters of a turbulent era.There were Abbie Hoffman, Bobby Seale, and Jerry Rubin, who took their Vietnam War protests to the streets. There was William M. Kunstler, the raspy-voiced defender of unpopular people and causes.There was Judge Julius J. Hoffman, an equally combative presence on the bench of Federal District Court. And there was Mr. Foran, the United States attorney and doggedly determined prosecutor.The seven defendants at the four-and-a-half-month trial stood accused of inciting the riots that swirled around the Democratic National Convention in 1968.Mr. Foran and his prosecuting team obtained convictions against five of them—David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rubin,</b> Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Davis—for the lesser charge of crossing state lines with intent to incite a riot; two defendants were acquitted, Lee Weiner and John R. Froines.Judge Hoffman imposed prison sentences on the five, as well as on Mr. Kunstler, whom he held in contempt. None of them served any time in prison because an appeals court threw out the convictions and rebuked Judge Hoffman for unseemly conduct in court and procedural errors.|$|E

Calling climate change “the existential threat of our age,” he called for the adoption of three proposals - revising estimates of the Gross Domestic Product to reflect climate change externalities, disclosure to investors by companies of the costs of carbon they emit that they might be required to absorb, and including in the U.S. government’s fiscal projections the future costs of dealing with climate change - to help catalyze a more active response to climate change risks. He first outlined the proposals in a Washington Post op-ed column titled “How Ignoring Climate Change Could Sink the U.S. Economy.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Having {{started in}} {{television}} {{in the late sixties}} with <b>Mr.</b> Rogers’ Neighborhood, <b>Rubin</b> has been making films since the early seventies. She stated that film aided in teaching about art therapy when words were often not completely adequate. Her first film in 1972, We’ll Show You What We’re Gonna Do, documented a therapeutic art program with blind children. Shortly after, she created Children and the Arts which highlighted the therapeutic value of the arts when working with children who were at-risk for problem behavior. Since then, she has created six other films: [...] "Beyond Words" [...] (art therapy with older adults), [...] "Breakthrough" [...] (artists in analytic therapy), [...] "Art Therapy: A Universal Language for Healing" [...] (art therapy around the world), [...] "Yes You Can!" [...] (art therapy for people with disabilities), and [...] "Art Therapy Has Many Faces" [...] (now subtitled in 14 languages). With her drama therapy colleague, Dr. Eleanor Irwin, she has produced [...] "The Green Creature Within" [...] (multimodal therapy with adolescents), and [...] "Creative Healing in Mental Health" [...] (art and drama in assessment and therapy).|$|R
