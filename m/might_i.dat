However, she stated, [...] "Worry though I <b>might,</b> <b>I</b> can’t resist Taylor Swift’s evolution from 'Tim McGraw' (2006) to her latest, 'Love Story'." [...] Bierly also compared Swift's acting with that of Keira Knightley. Fraser McAlpine of BBC believed Swift played a princess in the video and, therefore, said it would make females envious. The video was nominated for the [...] "Video of the Year" [...] category at the 45th Academy of Country Music Awards, but lost to Brad Paisley's [...] "Waitin' on a Woman" [...] (2008).

500|$|The International Cricket Council (ICC), {{responsible}} for running the game worldwide, conducted {{a trial in}} 2002 where lbw appeals could be referred to a match official, the third umpire, to review on television replays. The third umpire could only use technology to determine where the ball had pitched and if the batsman hit the ball with his bat. The ICC judged the experiment unsuccessful and did not pursue it. More trials followed in 2006, although ball-tracking technology remained unavailable to match officials. After a further series of trials, in 2009 the Umpire Decision Review System (DRS) was brought into international cricket where teams could refer the on-field decisions of umpires to a third umpire who had access to television replays and technology such as ball tracking. According to the ICC's general manager, Dave Richardson, DRS increased {{the frequency with which}} umpires awarded lbw decisions. In a 2012 interview, he said: [...] "Umpires may have realised that if they give someone out and DRS shows it was not out, then their decision can be rectified. So they <b>might,</b> <b>I</b> suppose, have the courage of their convictions a bit more and take a less conservative approach to giving the batsman out. I think if we're totally honest, DRS has affected the game slightly more than we thought it would." ...|$|E

This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and <b>might</b> <b>I</b> add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E

2500|$|While I {{was hearing}} the boys’ confessions {{on the evening}} of the 5th [...] I was {{suddenly}} terrorized by the sight of a celestial person who presented himself to my mind’s eye. He had in his hand a sort of weapon like a very long sharp-pointed steel blade which seemed to emit fire. At the very instant that I saw all this, I saw that person hurl the weapon into my soul with all his <b>might.</b> <b>I</b> cried out with difficulty and felt I was dying. I asked the boy to leave because I felt ill and no longer had the strength to continue. This agony lasted uninterruptedly until the morning of the 7th. I cannot tell you how much I suffered during this period of anguish. Even my entrails were torn and ruptured by the weapon, and nothing was spared. From that day on I have been mortally wounded. I feel in the depths of my soul a wound that is always open and which causes me continual agony.|$|E

50|$|<b>Might</b> <b>Is</b> Right, or The Survival of the Fittest, {{is a book}} by pseudonymous author Ragnar Redbeard. First {{published}} in 1890, it heavily advocates egoist anarchism, amorality, consequentialism and psychological hedonism. In <b>Might</b> <b>Is</b> Right, Redbeard rejects conventional ideas of human and natural rights and argues that only strength or physical might can establish moral right (à la Callicles or Thrasymachus). The book also attacks Christianity and Democracy. Friedrich Nietzsche's theories of master-slave morality and herd mentality serve as a clear inspiration for Redberard's book written contemporaneously.|$|R
