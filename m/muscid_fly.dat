The third instar of the housefly, Musca domestica (Linnaeus) (Diptera: Muscidae) were only found on dry {{stage of a}} decomposed (Day- 33) monkey carcass (Macaca fascicularis Raffles). This observation revealed that M. domestica maggots were found together with other <b>muscid</b> <b>fly</b> maggots, Hydrotaea (=Ophyra) spinigera (Stein) (Diptera: Muscidae) on dry stage of a carcass.

50|$|The {{leaves of}} cinquefoils are eaten by the {{caterpillars}} of many Lepidoptera, notably the grizzled skippers (genus Pyrgus), butterflies of the skipper family. Adult {{butterflies and moths}} visit cinquefoil flowers; for example, the endangered Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis) takes nectar from common cinquefoil (P. simplex). The Polish cochineal (Porphyrophora polonica), a scale insect once used to produce red dye, lives on cinquefoils and other plants in Eurasia. Some, but not all, cinquefoils are insect-pollinated, producing nectar that lures bees, hoverflies, <b>muscid</b> <b>flies,</b> butterflies, true bugs, and ants.|$|R
40|$|Equine thelaziosis {{caused by}} the eyeworm Thelazia lacrymalis is a {{parasitic}} disease transmitted by <b>muscid</b> <b>flies.</b> Although equine thelaziosis {{is known to have}} worldwide distribution, information on the epidemiology and presence of the intermediate hosts of T. lacrymalis is lacking. In the present work, a PCR-RFLP based assay on the first and/or second internal transcribed spacer (ITS 1 and ITS 2) of ribosomal DNA was developed for the detection of T. lacrymalis DNA in its putative vector(s). The sensitivity of the technique was also assessed. The restriction patterns obtained readily differentiated T. lacrymalis from four species of Musca (Diptera, Muscidae) (i. e. Musca autumnalis, Musca domestica, Musca larvipara and Musca osiris), which are potential vectors of equine eyeworms.

40|$|Pollen {{limitation}} {{is predicted to}} be particularly severe in tundra habitats. Numerous reproductive patterns associated with alpine and arctic species, particularly mechanisms associated with reproductive assurance, are suggested {{to be driven by}} high levels of pollen limitation. We studied the reproductive ecology of Parrya nudicaulis, a species with relatively large sexual reproductive investment and a wide range of floral pigmentation, in tundra habitats in interior montane Alaska to estimate the degree of pollen limitation. The plants are self-compatible and strongly protandrous, setting almost no seed in the absence of pollinators. Supplemental hand pollinations within pollinator exclusion cages indicated no cage effect on seed production. Floral visitation rates were low in both years of study and particularly infrequent in 2010. A diversity of insects visited P. nudicaulis, though syrphid and <b>muscid</b> <b>flies</b> composed the majority of all visits. Pollen-ovule ratios and levels of heterozygosity are consistent with a mixed mating system. Pollen limitation was severe; hand pollinations increased seed production per plant five-fold. Seed-to-ovule ratios remained low following hand pollinations, indicatin...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. December 2015. Major: Entomology. Advisor: Roger Moon. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 133 pages. Producers that graze or drylot cows in summer {{need to provide}} housing accommodations in winter. Cow comfort is an important consideration when selecting housing, particularly in areas with harsh winters. Alternative housing options being investigated in Minnesota include outwintering on a straw yard, and deep bedded compost. Stable flies, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.), are economically significant pests of dairy cows. Immature flies are found in decaying organic matter, such as soiled bedding. This research addressed how leftover debris from two winter housing systems, outdoor straw packs and indoor sawdust compost barns, differ in numbers and size of stable flies produced the following summer. Fly activity in summer are irritants that trigger defensive behaviors in cattle. Prolonged stress from flies can lead to significant production losses. This research also addressed the effect of three <b>muscid</b> <b>fly</b> species, stable flies, horn flies and face flies, on behavior and milk production of pastured cows...|$|E
40|$|Gastric or {{cutaneous}} habronemosis {{caused by}} Habronema microstoma Creplin, 1849 and Habronema muscae Carter, 1865 is a parasitic disease of equids transmitted by muscid flies. There is {{a paucity of}} information on the epidemiology of this disease, which is mainly due to limitations with diagnosis in the live animal and with the identification of the parasites in the intermediate hosts. To overcome such limitations, a molecular approach, based on the use of genetic markers in the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS- 2) of ribosomal DNA, was established for the two species of Habronema. Characterisation of the ITS- 2 revealed sequence lengths and G+C contents of 296 bp and 29. 5 % for H. microstoma, and of 334 bp and 35. 9 % for H. muscae, respectively. Exploiting the sequence difference (approximately 40 %) between the two species of nematode, primers were designed and tested by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for their specificity using a panel of control DNA samples from common equid endoparasites, and from host tissues, faeces or muscid flies. Effective amplification from each of the two species of Habronema was achieved from as little as 10 pg of genomic DNA. Hence, this molecular approach allows the specific identification and differentiation of the DNA from H. microstoma and H. muscae, and could thus provide a molecular tool for the specific detection of Habronema DNA (irrespective of developmental stage) from faeces, skin and <b>muscid</b> <b>fly</b> samples. The establishment of this tool has important implications for the specific diagnosis of clinical cases of gastric and cutaneous habronemosis in equids, and for studying the ecology and epidemiology of the two species of Habronema...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the genus Philornis (comprising ∼ 50 species), a group of <b>muscid</b> <b>flies</b> that {{parasitise}} birds and may be highly detrimental to host nestlings. Philornis species affect at least 115 species of bird, particularly in the Neotropics. The main distribution of Philornis is in Central and South America, extending to the southern United States. Larvae of the genus Philornis reside in bird nests and may feed on either nestling faeces (coprophagous scavengers), the blood of nestlings (semi-haematophagous parasites), or on nestling tissue and fluid (subcutaneous parasites). Depending on the species of Philornis, larval development can occur in bird faeces, in nesting material or inside nestlings. Nestling mortality depends on the species of Philornis, the intensity of infestation and nestling susceptibility, which in turn depends on the nestling species, age, brood size, body condition and the anatomical site of infestation. Consequently, variable effects of Philornis parasitism are observed in relation to nestling growth, development and fledging success. The impetus for this review is the recent discovery of Philornis downsi on the Galapagos Archipelago, combined with high Philornis-induced mortality in Darwin's finches. The potential for ectoparasites such as Philornis to compromise the viability of small, isolated bird populations is highlighted by this recently documented parasite invasion. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{effectiveness}} of 6 different baits used in fly traps for adult fly collection was compared in October-November, 2000, near the cafeteria of Maharaj Nakhon Chiang Mai Hos-pital, Chiang Mai Province, northern Thailand. The baits used were fresh viscera (pork, beef and fish) and fresh meat (pork, beef and fish), with 500 g of each kind {{being used in}} each fly trap for each experiment. All were replicated four times. Pork viscera yielded the highest effectiveness (35. 2 %), followed by fish meat (30 %). Four other kinds of bait showed relatively low efficiency, ie fish viscera (12. 0 %), beef viscera (9. 0 %), pork meat (8. 4 %) and beef meat (5. 4 %). The calliphorid Chrysomya megacephala was the most abundant fly species collected, while sarcophagids and <b>muscid</b> <b>flies</b> were found in much smaller numbers. The number of females was higher than males in all collections. Although all baits used were parts of animal carcasses that were very attractive for adult flies to feed upon and oviposit, {{the result of this}} study showed the differences in their effectiveness for fly collection, particularly during the late rainy season to early winter in Chiang Mai. Pork viscera showed the highest efficacy for metallic fly collection, but not for all species. Further study of suitable baits for the medically important fly species that exist in urban areas should, therefore, be performed...|$|R
40|$|In the field, the <b>muscid</b> <b>flies</b> Muscina stabulans (Fallén) and Muscina prolapsa (Harris) only colonised buried baits in June, July and August. The two-species co-occurred on baits {{buried at}} 5 cm but only M. prolapsa colonised baits buried at 10 cm. Other species of insect were seldom {{recovered}} from buried baits {{regardless of the}} presence or absence of Muscina larvae. In the laboratory, both M. stabulans and M. prolapsa preferentially colonised liver baits on the soil surface compared to those buried at 5 cm. Baits buried in dry soil were not colonised by either species whilst waterlogged soil severely reduced colonisation but did not prevent it entirely. Dry liver presented on the soil surface was colonised and supported growth to adulthood but if there was no surrounding medium in which the larvae could burrow then they died within 24 h. M. stabulans showed a consistent preference for ovipositing on decaying liver rather than fresh liver, even when it had decayed for 41 days. The results for M. prolapsa were more variable but it was also capable of developing on both fresh and very decayed remains. Blood-soaked soil and dead slugs and snails stimulated egg-laying by both species and supported larval growth to adulthood. Mushrooms, melon, and bananas also stimulated egg-laying although to a much lesser extent and very few larvae survived to adulthood. Horse faeces stimulated extensive egg-laying but the larvae invariably died during the first or second instar and none survived to pupariation. This information could be useful when determining the forensic significance of Muscina larvae recovered from dead bodies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFloral {{evolution}} {{often involves}} suites of traits, including morphology, colour and scent, but these traits are seldom analysed together in comparative studies. We investigated the associations between floral traits and pollination systems in Schizochilus, a southern African orchid genus with small nectar-producing flowers {{that has not}} been studied previously with respect to pollination biology. Field observations indicated the presence of distinct pollination systems in the four species which occur in the Drakensberg, including pollination by <b>muscid</b> <b>flies</b> in Schizochilus angustifolius, tachinid flies in Schizochilus zeyheri, various small flies in Schizochilus bulbinella and bees and wasps in Schizochilus flexuosus. Pollination success and pollen transfer efficiency clearly differed among the four species but were not correlated with the quantity of nectar rewards. Multivariate analysis of floral morphology and floral scent chemistry based on GC-MS data revealed significant differences among species as well as populations within species. The floral scent of S. angustifolius was dominated by the benzenoid compounds benzaldehyde and phenylacetaldehyde. Samples of one population of S. bulbinella were relatively similar to S. angustifolius but samples of another population were very distinct due to the occurrence of the nitrogen-containing compounds 3 -methyl-butyl aldoxime (syn/anti) and the higher amounts of aliphatic esters, alcohols and acids. In contrast, the floral scent of S. flexuosus and S. zeyheri was characterized by high relative amounts of methyl benzoate. We conclude that Schizochilus has distinct, specialized pollination systems associated with subtle but significant variation in floral morphology and scent chemistry. We also caution that sampling of several populations may be required to characterize floral scent composition at the species-level in plants...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{big step}} in the {{neurobiology}} of Drosophila would be to establish a standard for brain anatomy to which to relate morphological, developmental and genetic data. We propose that only an average brain and its variance would be a biologically meaningful reference and have developed an averaging procedure. Here, we present a brief outline of this method {{and apply it to}} the optic lobes of Drosophila melanogaster wild-type Canton S. Whole adult brains are stained with a fluorescent neuropil marker and scanned with the confocal microscope. The resulting three-dimensional data sets are automatically aligned into a common coordinate system and intensity averages calculated. We use effect–size maps for the fast detection of differences between averages. For morphometric analysis, neuropil structures are labelled and superimposed to give a three-dimensional probabilistic map. In the present study, the method was applied to 66 optic lobes. We found their size, shape and position to be highly conserved between animals. Similarity was even higher between left and right optic lobes of the same animal. Sex differences were more pronounced. Female optic lobes were 6 % larger than those of males. This value corresponds well with the higher number of ommatidia in females. As females have their additional ommatidia dorsally and ventrally, the additional neuropil in the medulla, lobula and lobula plate, accordingly, was found preferentially at these locations. For males, additional neuropil was found only at the posterior margin of the lobula. This finding supports the notion of male-specific neural processing in the lobula as described for <b>muscid</b> and calliphorid <b>flies...</b>|$|R
40|$|We used {{arrays of}} {{artificial}} flowers {{with and without}} fragrance to determine the importance of olfactory and visual cues in attracting insects to a floral mimic. The mimic is a fungus, Puccinia monoica Arth., which causes its crucifer hosts (here, Arabis drummondii Gray) to form pseudoflowers that mimic co-occurring flowers such as the buttercup, Ranunculus inamoenus Greene. Although pseudoflowers are visually similar to buttercups, their sweet fragrance is distinct. To determine whether visitors to pseudoflowers were responding to fragrance we performed an experiment in which we removed the visual cues, but allowed fragrance to still be perceived. In this experiment we found that pseudoflower fragrance can attract visitors by itself. In other experiments {{we found that the}} relative importance of olfactory and visual cues depended on the species of visitor. Halictid bees (Dialictus sp.) had a somewhat greater visual than olfactory response, whereas <b>flies</b> (<b>muscids</b> and anthomyiids) were more dependent on olfactory cues. We also used bioassays to determine which of the many compounds present in the natural fragrance were responsible for attraction. We found that halictid bees were equally attracted to pseudoflowers and to a blend containing phenylacetaldehyde, 2 -phenylethanol, benzaldehyde and methylbenzoate in the same relative concentrations as in pseudoflowers. Flies, on the other hand, only responded to pseudoflower scent, indicating that we have not yet identified the compound(s) present in pseudoflowers that are attracting them. The ability of insects to differentiate pseudoflowers from true flowers by their fragrance may be important {{in the evolution of the}} mimicry system. Different fragrances may facilitate proper transfer of both fungal spermatia and pollen, and thus make it possible for the visual mimicry to evolve...|$|R
