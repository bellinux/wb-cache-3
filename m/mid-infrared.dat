5|$|Which {{part of the}} {{electromagnetic}} spectrum—the visible, near-infrared (NIR) or <b>mid-infrared</b> (MIR)—produces the most accurate angular measurement is still debated. In 1996, Betelgeuse was shown to have a uniform disk of 56.6 ± 1.0mas. In 2000, the SSL team produced another measure of 54.7 ± 0.3mas, ignoring any possible contribution from hotspots, which are less noticeable in the <b>mid-infrared.</b> Also included was a theoretical allowance for limb darkening, yielding a diameter of 55.2 ± 0.5mas. The earlier estimate equates to a radius of roughly 5.6AU or , assuming the 2008 Harper distance of 197.0 ± 45pc, a figure {{roughly the size of}} the Jovian orbit of 5.5AU, published in 2009 in Astronomy Magazine and a year later in NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{researchers}} described galaxies called super-luminous spirals. They {{are very}} large with an upward diameter of 437,000 light-years (compared to the Milky Way's 100,000 light-year diameter). With {{a mass of}} 340 billion solar masses, they generate {{a significant amount of}} ultraviolet and <b>mid-infrared</b> light. They are thought to have an increased star formation rate around 30 times faster than the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|In a study {{published}} in December 2000, the star's diameter was measured with the Infrared Spatial Interferometer (ISI) at <b>mid-infrared</b> wavelengths producing a limb-darkened estimate of 55.2±0.5milliarcseconds (mas)—a figure entirely consistent with Michelson's findings eighty years earlier. At the time of its publication, the estimated parallax from the Hipparcos mission was 7.63 ± 1.64mas, yielding an estimated radius for Betelgeuse of 3.6AU. However, an infrared interferometric {{study published}} in 2009 announced that the star had shrunk by 15% since 1993 at an increasing rate without a significant diminution in magnitude. Subsequent observations suggest that the apparent contraction may be due to shell activity in the star's extended atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Americium readily {{reacts with}} oxygen and dissolves well in acids. The most common {{oxidation}} state for americium is +3, in which americium compounds are rather stable against oxidation and reduction. In this sense, americium is chemically similar to most lanthanides. The trivalent americium forms insoluble fluoride, oxalate, iodate, hydroxide, phosphate and other salts. Other oxidation {{states have been}} observed between +2 and +7, which is the widest range among the actinide elements. Their color in aqueous solutions varies as follows: Am3+ (colorless to yellow-reddish), Am4+ (yellow-reddish), AmV; (yellow), AmVI (brown) and AmVII (dark green). All oxidation states have their characteristic optical absorption spectra, with a few sharp peaks in the visible and <b>mid-infrared</b> regions, and the position and intensity of these peaks can be converted into the concentrations of the corresponding oxidation states. For example, Am(III) has two sharp peaks at 504 and 811nm, Am(V) at 514 and 715nm, and Am(VI) at 666 and 992nm.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter {{demonstrates}} bright, persistent aurorae around both poles. Unlike Earth's aurorae, {{which are}} transient and only occur {{at times of}} heightened solar activity, Jupiter's aurorae are permanent, though their intensity varies from day to day. They consist of three main components: the main ovals, which are bright, narrow (less than 1000km in width) circular features located at approximately 16° from the magnetic poles; the satellites' auroral spots, which correspond to the footprints of the magnetic field lines connecting Jupiter's ionosphere with those of its largest moons, and transient polar emissions situated within the main ovals. Whereas the auroral emissions were detected in almost {{all parts of the}} electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to X-rays (up to 3keV), they are brightest in the <b>mid-infrared</b> (wavelength 3–4μm and 7–14μm) and deep ultraviolet spectral regions (wavelength 80–180nm).|$|E
5|$|Trujillo {{and colleagues}} have placed upper limits in Sedna's surface {{composition}} of 60% for methane ice and 70% for water ice. The presence of methane further supports {{the existence of}} tholins on Sedna's surface, because they are produced by irradiation of methane. Barucci and colleagues compared Sedna's spectrum with that of Triton and detected weak absorption bands belonging to methane and nitrogen ices. From these observations, they suggested the following model of the surface: 24% Triton-type tholins, 7% amorphous carbon, 10% nitrogen, 26% methanol, and 33% methane. The detection of methane and water ices was confirmed in 2006 by the Spitzer Space Telescope <b>mid-infrared</b> photometry. The presence of nitrogen on the surface suggests the possibility that, {{at least for a}} short time, Sedna may have a tenuous atmosphere. During a 200-year period near perihelion, the maximum temperature on Sedna should exceed , the transition temperature between alpha-phase solid N2 and the beta phase seen on Triton. At 38 K, the N2 vapor pressure would be 14 microbar (1.4 Pa or 0.000014 atm). However, its deep red spectral slope is indicative of high concentrations of organic material on its surface, and its weak methane absorption bands indicate that methane on Sedna's surface is ancient, rather than freshly deposited. This means that Sedna is too cold for methane to evaporate from its surface and then fall back as snow, which happens on Triton and probably on Pluto.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mid-InfraRed</b> Instrument (MIRI) will {{measure the}} <b>mid-infrared</b> {{wavelength}} range from 5 to 27 micrometers. It contains both a <b>mid-infrared</b> camera and an imaging spectrometer. MIRI was {{developed as a}} collaboration between NASA and a consortium of European countries, and is led by George Rieke (University of Arizona) and Gillian Wright (UK Astronomy Technology Centre, Edinburgh, part of the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC)). MIRI features similar wheel mechanisms as NIRSpec which are also developed and built by Carl Zeiss Optronics GmbH under contract from the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, Heidelberg. The completed Optical Bench Assembly of MIRI was delivered to Goddard in mid-2012 for eventual integration into the ISIM. The temperature of the MIRI must not exceed 6 Kelvin (K): a helium gas mechanical cooler sited on the warm side of the environmental shield provides this cooling.|$|E
25|$|A Interband cascade laser (ICL) {{is a type}} {{of laser}} diode that can produce {{coherent}} radiation over {{a large part of the}} <b>mid-infrared</b> region of the electromagnetic spectrum.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a heavy metal {{fluoride}} glass is the ZBLAN glass group, composed of zirconium, barium, lanthanum, aluminium, and sodium fluorides. Their main technological application is as optical waveguides in both planar and fiber form. They are advantageous especially in the <b>mid-infrared</b> (2,000–5,000nm) range.|$|E
25|$|Trans fat {{levels may}} be measured. Measurement {{techniques}} include chromatography (by silver ion chromatography on {{thin layer chromatography}} plates, or small high-performance liquid chromatography columns of silica gel with bonded phenylsulfonic acid groups whose hydrogen atoms have been exchanged for silver ions). The role of silver lies {{in its ability to}} form complexes with unsaturated compounds. Gas chromatography and <b>mid-infrared</b> spectroscopy are other methods in use.|$|E
25|$|In 2017, Breakthrough Initiatives and the European Southern Observatory (ESO) {{entered a}} {{collaboration}} to enable {{and implement a}} search for habitable planets in the nearby star system, Alpha Centauri. The agreement involves Breakthrough Initiatives providing funding for an upgrade to the VISIR (VLT Imager and Spectrometer for <b>mid-Infrared)</b> instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. This upgrade will greatly {{increase the likelihood of}} planet detection in the system.|$|E
25|$|The general {{shape of}} the {{ultraviolet}} through near-infrared (0.125 to 3.5 μm) extinction curve in our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is fairly well characterized by the single parameter R(V) (which is different along different lines of sight through the galaxy), but there are known deviations from this single parameter characterization. Extending the extinction law into the <b>mid-infrared</b> wavelength range is difficult {{due to the lack}} of suitable targets and various contributions by absorption features.|$|E
25|$|Relatively cool objects (temperatures {{less than}} several {{thousand}} degrees) emit their radiation {{primarily in the}} infrared, as described by Planck's law. As a result, most objects that are cooler than stars are better studied in the infrared. This includes the clouds of the interstellar medium, brown dwarfs, planets both in our own and other solar systems, comets and Kuiper belt objects that will be observed with the <b>Mid-Infrared</b> Instrument (MIRI) requiring an additional cry-cooler.|$|E
25|$|Nano-FTIR {{systems can}} be easily {{integrated}} into synchrotron radiation beamlines. The use of synchrotron radiation allows for acquisition of an entire <b>mid-infrared</b> spectrum at once. Synchrotrons radiation has already been utilized in synchrotron infrared microscopectroscopy - the technique most widely used in biosciences, providing information on chemistry on microscales of virtually all biological specimens, like bone, plants, and other biological tissues. Nano-FTIR brings the spatial resolution to 10-20nm scale (vs. ~2-5 μm in microspectroscopy), which has been utilized for broadband spatially-resolved spectroscopy of crystalline materials, semiconductors, biominerals and proteins.|$|E
25|$|The {{infrared}} {{portion of}} the electromagnetic spectrum is usually divided into three regions; the near-, mid- and far- infrared, named for their relation to the visible spectrum. The higher-energy near-IR, approximately 14000–4000cm−1 (0.8–2.5μm wavelength) can excite overtone or harmonic vibrations. The <b>mid-infrared,</b> approximately 4000–400cm−1 (2.5–25μm) may be used to study the fundamental vibrations and associated rotational-vibrational structure. The far-infrared, approximately 400–10cm−1 (25–1000μm), lying adjacent to the microwave region, has low energy and may be used for rotational spectroscopy. The names and classifications of these subregions are conventions, and are only loosely based on the relative molecular or electromagnetic properties.|$|E
25|$|The first {{close-up}} {{investigation of}} Io using high-resolution imaging {{was performed by}} the twin probes, Voyager1 and Voyager2, launched on September 5 and August 20, 1977, respectively. These two spacecraft were part of NASA and JPL's Voyager program to explore the giant outer planets {{through a series of}} missions in the late 1970s and 1980s. This was a scaled-down version of the earlier Planetary Grand Tour concept. Both probes contained more sophisticated instrumentation than the previous Pioneer missions, including a camera capable of taking much higher resolution images. This was important for viewing the geologic features of Jupiter's Galilean moons as well as the cloud features of Jupiter itself. They also had spectrometers with a combined spectral range from the far-ultraviolet to the <b>mid-infrared,</b> useful for examining Io's surface and atmospheric composition and to search for thermal emission sources on its surface.|$|E
25|$|Measurements of Io's thermal {{radiation}} in the <b>mid-infrared</b> spectrum in the 1970s led to conflicting results {{that were not}} explained accurately until after {{the discovery of the}} active volcanism by Voyager 1 in 1979. An anomalously high thermal flux, compared to the other Galilean satellites, was observed at an infrared wavelength of 10μm while Io was in Jupiter's shadow. At the time, this heat flux was attributed to the surface having a much higher thermal inertia than Europa and Ganymede. These results were considerably different from measurements taken at wavelengths of 20μm which suggested that Io had similar surface properties to the other Galilean satellites. NASA researchers observed a sharp increase in Io's thermal emission at 5μm on February 20, 1978, possibly due to an interaction between the satellite and Jupiter's magnetosphere, though volcanism was not ruled out.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the end of}} the Galileo mission, {{astronomers have}} {{continued}} monitoring Io's active volcanoes with adaptive optics imaging from the Keck telescope in Hawaii and the European Southern Observatory in Chile, as well as imaging from the Hubble telescope. These technologies are used to observe the thermal emissions and measure the composition of gases over volcanoes such as Pele and Tvashtar. Imaging from the Keck telescope in February 2001 revealed the most powerful volcanic eruption observed in modern times, either on Io or on Earth, at the volcano Surt. Earth-based telescopes coming online over the next decade, such as the Thirty Meter Telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatory, will provide more-detailed observations of Io's volcanoes, approaching the resolution achieved by Galileos near-IR spectrometer. Hubble ultraviolet, millimeter-wave, and ground-based <b>mid-infrared</b> observations of Io's atmosphere have revealed strong density heterogeneities between bright, frost-covered regions along the satellite's equator and its polar regions, providing further evidence that Ionian atmosphere is supported by the sublimation of sulfur dioxide frost on Io's surface.|$|E
25|$|However, {{infrared}} telescopes have an Achilles heelthey {{need to stay}} extremely cold, and {{the longer}} the wavelength of infrared, the colder they need to be. If not, the background heat of the device itself overwhelms the detectors, making it effectively blind. This can be overcome by careful spacecraft design, in particular by placing the telescope in dewar with an extremely cold substance, such as liquid helium. This has meant most infrared telescopes have a lifespan limited by their coolant, as short as a few months, maybe a few years at most. It has been possible to maintain a temperature low enough through {{the design of the}} spacecraft to enable near-infrared observations without a supply of coolant, such as the extended missions of Spitzer or NEOWISE. Another example is Hubble's NICMOS instrument, which started out using a block of nitrogen ice that depleted after a couple years, but was then converted to a cryocooler that worked continuously. The James Webb Space Telescope is designed to cool itself without a dewar, using a combination of sun-shield and radiators with the <b>mid-infrared</b> instrument using an additional cryocooler.|$|E
25|$|Nano-FTIR {{was first}} {{described}} in 2005 in a patent by Ocelic and Hillenbrand as Fourier transform spectroscopy of tip-scattered light with an asymmetric spectrometer (i.e. the tip/sample placed {{inside one of}} the interferometer arms). The first realization of s-SNOM with FTIR was demonstrated in 2006 in the laboratory of F. Keilmann using a <b>mid-infrared</b> source based on a simple version of nonlinear difference-frequency generation (DFG). However, the mid-IR spectra in this realization were recorded using dual comb spectroscopy principles, yielding a discrete set of frequencies and thus demonstrating a multiheterodyne imaging technique rather than nano-FTIR. The first continuous spectra were recorded only in 2009 in the same laboratory using a supercontinuum IR beam also obtained by DFG in GaSe upon superimposing two pulsed trains emitted from Er-doped fiber laser. This source further allowed in 2011 for the first assessment of nanoscale-resolved spectra of SiC with excellent quality and spectral resolution. At the same time, Huth et al. in the laboratory of R. Hillenbrand used IR radiation from a simple glowbar source in combination with the principles of Fourier transform spectroscopy, to record IR spectra of p-doped Si and its oxides in a semiconductor device. In the same work the term nano-FTIR was first introduced. However, an insufficient spectral irradiance of glowbar sources limited the applicability of the technique to the detection of strongly-resonant excitations such phonons; and the early supercontinuum IR laser sources, while providing more power, had very narrow bandwidth (<300nbsp&cm−1). Further attempt to improve the spectral power, while retaining the large bandwidth of a glowbar source was made by utilizing the IR radiation from a high temperature argon arc source (also known as plasma source). However, due to lack of commercial availability and rapid development of the IR supercontinium laser sources, plasma sources are not widely utilized in nano-FTIR.|$|E
500|$|An {{analysis}} of <b>mid-infrared</b> observations with the WISE telescope have {{ruled out the}} possibility of a Saturn-sized object (95 Earth masses) out to 10,000 AU, and a Jupiter-sized or larger object out to 26,000 AU.|$|E
500|$|A team {{of astronomers}} {{working in the}} {{near-infrared}} announced in 2004, that the more accurate photospheric measurement was 43.33 ± 0.04mas. The study also put forth an explanation as to why varying wavelengths from the visible to <b>mid-infrared</b> produce different diameters: the star is seen through a thick, warm extended atmosphere. At short wavelengths (the visible spectrum) the atmosphere scatters light, thus slightly increasing the star's diameter. At near-infrared wavelengths (K and L bands), the scattering is negligible, so the classical photosphere can be directly seen; in the <b>mid-infrared</b> the scattering increases once more, causing the thermal emission of the warm atmosphere to increase the apparent diameter.|$|E
500|$|Measurements can {{be taken}} at varying {{wavelengths}} within the electromagnetic spectrum and the difference in reported diameters can {{be as much as}} 30–35%, yet comparing one finding with another is difficult as the star's apparent size differs depending on the wavelength used. Studies have shown that the measured angular diameter is considerably larger at ultraviolet wavelengths, decreases through the visible to a minimum in the near-infrared, and increase again in the <b>mid-infrared</b> spectrum; ...|$|E
500|$|Zinc {{chloride}} {{is often}} added to lumber as a fire retardant and sometimes as a wood preservative. It {{is used in}} the manufacture of other chemicals. Zinc methyl (...) is used in a number of organic syntheses. Zinc sulfide (ZnS) is used in luminescent pigments such as on the hands of clocks, X-ray and television screens, and luminous paints. Crystals of ZnS are used in lasers that operate in the <b>mid-infrared</b> part of the spectrum. Zinc sulfate is a chemical in dyes and pigments. Zinc pyrithione is used in antifouling paints.|$|E
500|$|The {{debate about}} {{differences}} between measurements in the <b>mid-infrared,</b> which suggest a possible expansion and contraction of the star, and the near-infrared, which advocates a relatively constant photospheric diameter, {{remains to be}} resolved. In a paper published in 2012, the Berkeley team reported that their measurements were [...] "dominated by the behavior of cool, optically thick material above the stellar photosphere," [...] indicating that the apparent expansion and contraction {{may be due to}} activity in the star's outer shells and not the photosphere itself. This conclusion, if further corroborated, would suggest an average angular diameter for Betelgeuse closer to Perrin's estimate at 43.33arcseconds, hence a stellar radius of about 3.4AU (...) assuming the shorter Hipparcos distance of 498±73ly in lieu of Harper's estimate at 643±146ly. The Gaia spacecraft may clarify assumptions presently used in calculating the size of Betelgeuse's stellar disk.|$|E
2500|$|Some of the {{missions}} in infrared astronomy that impacted JWST development were Spitzer {{and also the}} WMAP probe. Spitzer showed the importance of <b>mid-infrared,</b> such as in its observing dust disks around stars. Also, the WMAP probe showed the universe was [...] "lit up" [...] at redshift 17, further underscoring {{the importance of the}} <b>mid-infrared.</b> Both these missions launched in the early 2000s, in time to influence JWST development. On JWST the <b>mid-infrared</b> science instrument is MIRI, and it required an additional cry-cooler.|$|E

2500|$|The {{telescope}} has {{an expected}} mass {{about half of}} Hubble Space Telescope's, but its primary mirror (a 6.5 meter diameter gold-coated beryllium reflector) will have a collecting area about five times as large ( [...] vs. [...] ). The JWST is oriented toward near-infrared astronomy, but can also see orange and red visible light, {{as well as the}} <b>mid-infrared</b> region, depending on the instrument. The design emphasizes the near to <b>mid-infrared</b> for three main reasons: High-redshift objects have their visible emissions shifted into the infrared, cold objects such as debris disks and planets emit most strongly in the infrared, and this band is difficult to study from the ground or by existing space telescopes such as Hubble.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the sources}} of {{information}} about the ionosphere and thermosphere comes from ground-based measurements of the intense <b>mid-infrared</b> (3–4μm) emissions of the trihydrogen cation (...) [...] The total emitted power is 1–2W—an order of magnitude higher than that the near-infrared hydrogen quadrupole emissions. Trihydrogen cation functions as one of main coolers of the ionosphere.|$|E

2500|$|The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space {{telescope}} {{that is part}} of NASA's Next Generation Space Telescope program, developed in coordination between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency.

2500|$|For {{practical}} purposes, {{the separation}} between wires must be less than the wavelength of the incident radiation. [...] In addition, the width of each wires should be small compared to the spacing between wires. Therefore, it {{is relatively easy to}} construct wire-grid polarizers for microwaves, far-infrared, and <b>mid-infrared</b> radiation. [...] In addition, advanced lithographic techniques can also build very tight pitch metallic grids, allowing for the polarization of visible light to a useful degree. Since the degree of polarization depends little on wavelength and angle of incidence, they are used for broad-band applications such as projection.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the leading}} {{hemisphere}} of Tethys spacecraft observations {{have found a}} dark bluish band spanning 20° {{to the south and}} north from the equator. The band has an elliptical shape getting narrower as it approaches the trailing hemisphere. A comparable band exists only on Mimas. The band is almost certainly caused by the influence of energetic electrons from the Saturnian magnetosphere with energies greater than about 1MeV. These particles drift in the direction opposite to the rotation of the planet and preferentially impact areas on the leading hemisphere close to the equator. [...] Temperature maps of Tethys obtained by Cassini, have shown this bluish region is cooler at midday than surrounding areas, giving the satellite a [...] "Pac-man"-like appearance at <b>mid-infrared</b> wavelengths.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 1985, the Air Force tested an SDIO-funded {{deuterium}} fluoride laser known as <b>Mid-Infrared</b> Advanced Chemical Laser (MIRACL) at White Sands Missile Range.

[...] These test conditions {{were used to}} simulate the loads a booster would be under during launch. The system was later tested on target drones simulating cruise missiles for the US Navy, with some success. After the SDIO closed, the MIRACL was tested on an old Air Force satellite for potential use as an anti-satellite weapon, with mixed results. The technology was also used to develop the Tactical High Energy Laser, (THEL) which is being tested to shoot down artillery shells.|$|E
