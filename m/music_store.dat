The sophistication of online <b>music</b> <b>stores</b> varies. Some online <b>music</b> <b>stores</b> have a single photo of the item, the product name and price, and a few bullets about the features. On the other hand, some online <b>music</b> <b>stores</b> have interactive Web 2.0 features, such as 360 degree virtual reality-style images of the products, in which the viewer can [...] "turn" [...] the product around to see the back and sides, online comments sections where customers can review their purchases and additional music-related content, such as articles on musical instruments or sound gear written by store staff.

5|$|After {{the school}} bus is destroyed, Homer is forced to drive several {{students}} to school. Along the way, he listens to a classic rock radio station and is shocked to discover {{that all of the}} kids hate it. After several more days of the kids hating his music, Homer visits a <b>music</b> <b>store</b> and realizes that what he likes is no longer considered cool. As a result, Homer decides to take Bart and Lisa to the Hullabalooza music festival. At the festival, Homer tries to act cool by wearing a Rastafarian hat, but all he does is humiliate himself and is confronted by an angry crowd of Generation Xers who mistake him for a narc. After being tossed out by the crowd, Homer angrily kicks a cannon, which shoots one of Peter Frampton's inflatable pigs at his stomach.

This caused a massive quarrel {{with the rest of the}} group when Mona came to pay them, as they wanted Brown's money to be shared amongst the three of them, as Brown had not played.

5|$|Pat Secor, Hoppus' boss at <b>music</b> <b>store</b> The Wherehouse, was {{attempting}} {{to start his own}} record label, named Filter Records. Secor pulled money from his savings and helped finance and produce the demo recording. Buddha was recorded live at local Santee studio Doubletime, compiling a collection that represented nearly all of the songs the band had written up to that point. Hoppus and friends Cam Jones and Kerry Key created the cassette artwork, and the original cassette packaging was compiled by the band and Hoppus' family. Locally distributed to several San Diego record stores and available for purchase at early concerts, Buddha helped the trio cement an audience and was a deciding factor in their signing to local label Cargo in 1993.|$|E
5|$|The Apple-Cohen dispute was a {{cybersquatting}} {{case where}} a top-level domain registrar's decision differed from prior decisions by awarding a domain name to a subsequent registrant (Apple), {{rather than to the}} prior registrant (Cohen). As the decision recounts, in November 2000, Benjamin Cohen of CyberBritain registered the domain name itunes.co.uk. The domain initially pointed to skipmusic.com, and then to cyberbritain.com, and was then inoperative for some time. Apple applied for a UK trademark for iTunes in October 2000 which was granted in March 2001, and then launched its UK iTunes <b>music</b> <b>store</b> service in 2004. Afterward, Cohen reactivated his registered domain name, redirecting it to iTunes' then-rival, Napster; later Cohen forwarded the domain name to his CyberBritain's cash back/rewards website.|$|E

She had a job at a <b>music</b> <b>store</b> but left this for a better one at the Central Bank. Straight from the Central Bank, she hurried to the University every day.

Other groups like The Searchers and Gerry & The Pacemakers later played in the club. The Black Jacks became the resident group at The Casbah, although The Quarrymen occasionally played there again and often visited. It was in The Casbah Club that Lennon and McCartney convinced Sutcliffe to buy a Hofner president bass guitar and join The Quarrymen.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of {{games in the}} franchise, including all of the main series games, {{have led to a}} soundtrack album release. Many have also inspired orchestral, vocal, or piano arrangement albums as well. These albums have been produced and reprinted by a number of different companies, including DigiCube, NTT Publishing, Square Enix itself, and many others. Additionally, many albums have been made available at the iTunes <b>Music</b> <b>Store.</b> In addition to the regular albums, a number of compilation albums of pieces from several Final Fantasy games have been produced both by Square Enix and outside groups, both officially and unofficially. These albums include music directly from the games, as well as arrangements covering a variety of styles. Square Enix produced the first album, Final Fantasy 1987â€“1994 (1994) and has since produced 13albums, leading up to Final Fantasy Remix (2008).

5|$|The {{original}} idea behind Slackers first occurred in 1990. Along with some friends, Kurt Jellinek and Paul Zacharias {{went to a}} Don Henley concert, and began thinking about owning their own <b>music</b> <b>store.</b> At the time, the two were undergraduate students, and decided to focus their studies on business management and becoming entrepreneurs. Slackers CDs and Games was officially founded in 1993, by Jellinek and Zacharias, in Columbia, Missouri. Jellinek and Zacharias opened the store after graduating from Saint Louis University, using only their own collection of 1,500 music CDs. The name originated from their generation being considered slackers before being {{given a chance to}} prove otherwise. Although business was slow at first, with the store sometimes only making US$30 in a day, business eventually increased. After 2years they were able to open a second location in O'Fallon, Illinois. As of 2009, there are 10 locations in the states of Missouri and Illinois, eight of which are in the St. Louis Metropolitan Area, and two of which are in Mid-Missouri.|$|E
