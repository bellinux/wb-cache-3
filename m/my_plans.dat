500|$|On September 18, 2013, {{after six}} years as Secretary, Clough {{announced}} his retirement, which would be effective October 2014. In announcing his retirement, he said, [...] "When I became Secretary in 2008, I believed strongly that the Smithsonian had enormous untapped potential, especially in digital technology, to reach millions of people {{and serve as a}} resource for those who cannot visit Washington. I am confident that with our initiatives underway in bioconservation, education, digitization and fundraising, this is the right time to announce <b>my</b> <b>plans</b> for next fall so that an orderly transition can begin." ...|$|E

[...] Led by Adam Stephen, they had not known about the plan to attack Trenton, and had attacked a Hessian outpost. [...] Washington feared the Hessians would {{have been put on}} guard, and shouted at Stephen, [...] "You sir! You Sir, may have ruined all <b>my</b> <b>plans</b> by having them put on their guard." [...] Despite this, Washington ordered the advance continue to Trenton. In the event, Rall thought the first raid was the attack which Grant had warned him about, and {{that there would be no}} further action that day.|$|E

Some people stay with a series until the end, you know, and afterwards they often have some problems, I think, finding new opportunities. And I wanted a career after Dallas. There's great sadness in leaving my friends and the show – I was never bored with it – but I'm not at all ambivalent about this. I'm realistic about taking care of myself financially. I didn't want to walk away blindly without plans. <b>My</b> <b>plans</b> are set. I have a project with a network that is ready to go that I can't talk about yet. It's a drama mystery." ...|$|E

500|$|On 12 June 2012, Spearritt {{denied the}} reunion plans {{and stated that}} she will not return to S Club or {{continue}} her music career and will keep on pursuing her acting career. She stated [...] "It's cool that bands like Steps are getting back together, because it's worked out for lots of people. But I don't see it in <b>my</b> <b>plans</b> at all. In the future, I hope I'll still be working {{and being able to}} do what I love. I feel very lucky at the minute, and doing theatre has really opened more doors for me. So as long as I can keep doing what I love, I'm very lucky." [...] On 24 March 2013, Stevens said to the Daily Mirror that a reunion could still happen: [...] "We met up not long ago and we talked about it and we still are talking about it. We are all in the same head space, talking about how special it was and we do all want to celebrate what we had. So it's definitely a possibility." ...|$|E
500|$|On 15 March 1899 Bruce {{wrote to}} Sir Clements Markham at the RGS, {{offering}} {{himself for the}} scientific staff of the National Antarctic Expedition, then in its early planning stages. Markham's reply was a non-committal one-line acknowledgement, after which Bruce heard nothing for a year. He was then told, indirectly, {{to apply for a}} scientific assistant's post. On 21 March 1900 Bruce reminded Markham that he had applied a year earlier, and went on to reveal that he [...] "was not without hopes of being able to raise sufficient capital whereby I could take out a second British ship". He followed this up a few days later, and reported that the funding for a second ship was now assured, making his first explicit references to a [...] "Scottish Expedition". This alarmed Markham, who replied with some anger: [...] "Such a course will be most prejudicial to the Expedition A second ship is not in the least required I do not know why this mischievous rivalry should have been started". Bruce replied by return, denying rivalry, and asserting: [...] "If my friends are prepared to give me money to carry out <b>my</b> <b>plans</b> I do not see why I should not accept it [...] there are several who maintain that a second ship is highly desirable". Unappeased, Markham wrote back: [...] "As I was doing my best to get you appointed (to the National Antarctic Expedition) I had a right to think you would not take such a step without at least consulting me". He continued: [...] "You will cripple the National Expedition [...] in order to get up a scheme for yourself".|$|E

Thirdly, I might have regretted it if I declined." [...] On 20 February 2006, Gilmour commented again on Pink Floyd's future when he was interviewed by Billboard.com, stating, [...] "Who knows?

2500|$|All {{the pupils}} under John Bosco {{observed}} a monthly event called The Exercise of a Happy Death; this practice continues {{under the name}} The Monthly Day of Recollection.

Bosco notes that Dominic observed this practice devoutly, and that one day, Dominic said that he would be the first amongst the group to die.

2500|$|At {{least since}} 1847 and {{in line with}} the Liberals, Bismarck had also been of the professed opinion, that state and church should be {{completely}} separated and [...] "the sphere of the state had to be made secure against the incursions by the church", although his ideas were not as far reaching as in the United States or in Great Britain. He had in mind the traditional position of the Protestant church in Prussia and provoked considerable resistance from conservative Protestants. This became clear in a heated debate with Prussian culture minister von Mühler in 1871 when Bismarck said: [...] "Since you stopped <b>my</b> <b>plans</b> in the Protestant church, I have to go via Rome". [...] In August 1871 at Bad Ems, Bismarck revealed his intention to fight against the Centre Party, to separate state and church, to transfer school inspection to laymen, to abolish religious instruction from schools and to transfer religious affairs to the minister of justice.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{preliminary}} {{stages of the}} Battle of Xiaoting, Sun Huan had led a separate force to attack the Shu vanguard force at Yidao (夷道) but ended up being besieged by the enemy.

[...] After reading the letter, Zhong Hui was shocked and he told his close aides, [...] "When His Excellency ordered me to arrest Deng Ai, he knew I was capable of accomplishing the task alone. However, now, since he has brought his troops here, he must be suspecting me. We should take action quickly. If we succeed, the Empire is ours.

2500|$|Zhang Wen {{was from}} Wu County (吳縣), Wu Commandery (吳郡), {{which is in}} present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu. His father, Zhang Yun (張允), was famous in Wu Commandery for valuing {{friendship}} and having a low regard for material wealth. Zhang Yun also served as an Official in the East Bureau (東曹掾) under the warlord Sun Quan, who became the founding emperor of Eastern Wu later. At a young age, Zhang Wen was already known for his good moral conduct and for having a dignified appearance. When Sun Quan heard about him, he asked his subjects, [...] "As of now, who is Zhang Wen comparable to?" [...] Liu Ji, the Grand Prefect of Agriculture (大農令), said, [...] "He is comparable to Quan Cong." [...] However, Gu Yong, the Minister of Ceremonies (太常), had a different opinion, [...] "Liu Ji doesn't know him well enough. No one is comparable to Zhang Wen as of now."
