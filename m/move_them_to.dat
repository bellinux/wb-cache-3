5|$|Following the French {{surrender}} on 22 June, the French fleet {{was to be}} disarmed under German and Italian supervision, {{under the}} terms of the Armistice. The British high command, however, was concerned that the French ships would be seized by the Axis powers and placed in service. The Axis navies would then outnumber the British Royal Navy. Prime Minister Winston Churchill therefore ordered Vice Admiral James Somerville, the commander of Force H, to neutralize the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir. He was instructed to order the French vessels to join the British with the Free French, to <b>move</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> French possessions like Martinique where they would be outside the reach of the Axis powers, to <b>move</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the USA where they would be interned, to scuttle themselves, or be sunk. On 3 July, Somerville arrived and delivered the ultimatum. After 10 hours of discussions and the French rejection of any part of the ultimatum, the British ships opened fire.|$|E
5|$|Day {{wished for}} the girls to be {{isolated}} from external influences while he educated them so, {{at the beginning of}} November 1769, he decided to <b>move</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> France. It is also possible that he did this to protect himself from the legal ramifications of his experiment, as well as societal gossip. The trio travelled over 600 miles to Avignon, renting a house in le quartier des fusteries. The girls could speak no French and Day employed no English-speaking servants, to be sure that he would be the only person to influence them.|$|E

50|$|Also {{before the}} start of the 1974 season, the San Diego Swingers were sold to Don Kelleher who <b>moved</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Honolulu.|$|R
5|$|Mikhail Gorbachev's {{introduction}} of the policies of glasnost and perestroika in the 1980s also fueled Armenian visions {{of a better life}} under Soviet rule. The Hamshenis who were deported by Stalin to Kazakhstan began petitioning for the government to <b>move</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the Armenian SSR. This move was denied by the Soviet government because of fears that the Muslim Hamshenis might spark ethnic conflicts with their Christian Armenian cousins. However, another event that occurred during this time made an ethnic clash between Christian Armenians and Muslims inevitable.|$|E
5|$|More than 1,000schools {{and churches}} were {{converted}} to emergency shelters, but residents only occupied 47 of them before the storm's arrival. The country's high crime rate led islanders to fear for their belongings should they abandon their homes. UNICEF prepared 4emergency health kits and 1,000water containers and Copa Airlines agreed to fly the supplies to Jamaica on its scheduled August 22 flight, if possible. The World Food Program prepared food stock in nearby Haiti, ready to <b>move</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Jamaica if they were needed, although damage to their airport ultimately prevented their distribution.|$|E
5|$|The Coastal Discovery Museum, in {{conjunction}} with the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, patrols the beaches from May through October as part of the Sea Turtle Protection Project. The purpose of the project is to inventory and monitor nesting locations, and if necessary, <b>move</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> more suitable locations. During the summer months, the museum sponsors the Turtle Talk & Walk, which is a special tour designed to educate the public about this endangered species. To protect loggerhead sea turtles, a town ordinance stipulates that artificial lighting must be shielded so that it cannot be seen from the beach, or it must be turned off by 10:00p.m. from May 1 to October 31 each year.|$|E
50|$|The Hasinai groups {{continued}} {{to live in the}} Neches and Angelina River valleys up to the 1830s, but by the early 1840s, all Caddo groups had moved to the Brazos River area in an effort to avoid Anglo-American colonization. In 1855 the U.S. government <b>moved</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the Brazos Indian Reservation, and in 1859 <b>moved</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the Washita River in Indian Territory, now western Oklahoma. The Caddo still live in western Oklahoma, Binger, Oklahoma being the capital of Caddo Nation of Oklahoma.|$|R

5|$|The end came swiftly in {{the months}} after the Grey Cup. By the time of a December 1 CFL Board of Governors meeting, the Mad Dogs had already folded and the Barracudas were on the brink. The Pirates held out a little longer and flirted with a {{relocation}} to Norfolk, but local officials broke off talks after they learned that Glieberman was still facing legal disputes in Shreveport. The Barracudas resurfaced in the news in January 1996 when Williams sold them for $750,000 to a group that planned to <b>move</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Shreveport as a replacement for the Pirates. However, that deal was contingent upon the league approving the sale and relocation, which never happened.|$|E
5|$|The Las Vegas {{situation}} {{was one of}} a bevy of developments that absorbed the league in the 1994 to 1995 offseason. The team was not officially disbanded until April 1995 but not before the league damaged its credibility by twice giving provisional approval to a relocation to Jackson, Mississippi, {{to the point where the}} Mississippi team was included on the 1995 internal schedule and had hired a general manager and coaching staff, only to have the deal collapse amid squabbles with the Las Vegas corporation that owned the Posse. A group from Miami, Florida tried to convince the league to let it buy the remains of the Posse and <b>move</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> South Florida as the Miami Manatees in the Miami Orange Bowl. An exhibition game between Birmingham and Baltimore was held there in June 1995 to gauge support, which drew a decent crowd just above 20,000.|$|E
5|$|Jamaica, {{which was}} {{forecast}} {{to bear the}} brunt of Hurricane Dean, underwent the most extensive preparations. The Jamaican government executed long-standing evacuation plans, including converting the country's national arena into a shelter and relocating inmates from two maximum security prisons. Political parties in the island suspended their campaigning for the August 27 national elections, to allow residents to prepare for the storm. Curfews were put in place for parts of the island, while off-duty essential personnel were called back to work. More than 1,000 schools and churches were converted to emergency shelters, but residents only occupied 47 of them before the storm's arrival. Evidently the country's high crime rate led islanders to fear for their belongings should they abandon their homes. UNICEF prepared 4 emergency health kits and 1,000 water containers and Copa Airlines agreed to fly the supplies to Jamaica on its scheduled August 22 flight, if possible. The World Food Program prepared food stocks in nearby Haiti, ready to <b>move</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Jamaica if they were needed. The United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team tried to reach Jamaica, but only one member arrived before all incoming flights were canceled. The United States confirmed that it would offer aid if it was needed, and the North-West Caribbean Donor Group met to decide what actions would need to be taken.|$|E

5|$|Sophie {{was one of}} Mozart 's pups seen on Meerkat Manor. She had two {{brothers}} and one sister named Sparkle. Only one of her brothers was given a name and he was called Spud. They were born some time after Tosca, Mozart's sister, gave birth to three pups. Their uncle Yossarian decided to move their pups who {{were only a few}} days old. He brought each up above ground and started to <b>move</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> a new burrow. The babysitters followed him and carried each pup. The Whiskers returned and Yossarian dropped the pup he was carrying, who was Sophie's sister. Her sister got left behind and died later that night. The other pups were moved to the new burrow. One day, while being babysat by Yossarian, Mitch, Sophie's other uncle, viciously attacked her without warning. Yossarian failed to stop the assault and simply waited until Mitch was proud of the beating. Afterwards, little Sophie {{was in a state of}} shock, but thankfully Tosca gave Sophie a comforting cuddle. Sophie didn't re-appear in the series until much later, when she was older. She was seen babysitting a litter, but was finding them a bit of a handful. That was the last time Sophie was mentioned in Season 1. In this season and up until season 3, she was played by Tina Sparkle since the real Sophie was the one Youssarian unintentionally killed.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 17th century Spanish {{priorities}} changed, and {{the failure}} of the peaceful efforts of the Dominicans to convert the Ch'ol combined with the increasing British presence in the Caribbean led the colonial authorities to end the Dominican monopoly and allow the Franciscans and other orders to enter the region; military options were also viewed more favourably. Between 1685 and 1689, the Q'eqchi' of Cobán and Cahabón were forced to assist the Spanish in their armed expeditions against the Manche Ch'ol and in forcibly relocating them to Verapaz. These actions depopulated the southern Petén and led to the breakdown of the trade routes linking colonial Guatemala with the independent Maya of Petén. From 1692 to 1694, Franciscan friars Antonio Margil and Melchor López were active among the Manche and Lakandon Ch'ol. They were eventually expelled by the Ch'ol; upon their return to Santiago de Guatemala they proposed three invasion routes into southern Petén and neighbouring Chiapas. Throughout the 17th century, Spanish missionaries encountered considerable reticence among the Manche, until the Spanish finally decided to <b>move</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> an area where they could be more easily controlled. At the time of contact there were perhaps 10,000 Manche; these were devastated by war and disease, with the survivors relocated to Rabinal in the modern department of Baja Verapaz. After 1700 the Manche Ch'ol ceased to play any part in the history of Petén.|$|E
25|$|Kirby Smith {{had nearly}} 80,000 men to call upon, but was {{undecided}} where to <b>move</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> counter the three Union forces now {{known to be}} moving toward Shreveport. Taylor would never fight with more than 18,500 men throughout the entire campaign.|$|E

50|$|In 2016, {{the company}} {{controversially}} sold {{several of its}} journals to OMICS Publishing Group, who <b>moved</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Pulsus Group, a company that they recently acquired. OMICS {{is widely regarded as}} predatory.|$|R
25|$|And further {{east of the}} Transnistria Governorate {{there were}} many neo-Latin communities: indeed the Romanians/Moldavians in Ukraine - east of the Bug river - were {{calculated}} by a German census to be nearly 780.000 (probably an excessive number), and were made plans to <b>move</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Transnistria in 1942/43. But nothing was done.|$|E
25|$|As a result, the {{northern}} contingent was bogged down {{for about a}} week before helicopters could <b>move</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Nong Pet.

Four days later, {{the northern}} task force had moved within eight kilometers of Nong Pet.|$|E
25|$|Morgenthau {{used his}} {{position}} as Treasury chief to investigate organized crime and government corruption. Treasury Intelligence and other agencies (the notoriously fragmented US federal law enforcement system had five in the Treasury Department alone) were uncoordinated in their efforts; efforts to create a super-agency were stalled by J. Edgar Hoover, who feared his FBI would be overshadowed. Nevertheless, Morgenthau created a coordinator for the Treasury agencies; although the coordinator could not control them, he could <b>move</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> some cooperation.|$|E

25|$|The chosen {{location}} {{was occupied by}} an open-air market {{that had been in}} continuous operation since 1853. After loud complaints and much negotiation, the railroad agreed to purchase the markets for $1million and <b>move</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> a new structure: the Reading Terminal Market, located to the rear (north) of the headhouse at 12th and Filbert Streets. This required the trainshed and all of its tracks to be constructed one story above street level, with the Ninth Street Branch to bring trains in and out.|$|E
25|$|In early August, Chicago {{businessman}} Arnold Johnson {{stepped forward}} with a complicated $3.375 million plan to buy the Athletics and <b>move</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Kansas City. He owned Blues Stadium, home to the New York Yankees' top minor-league affiliate, but intended {{to sell it to}} the city for upgrading to major league standards. Roy, Earle and Connie Mack, Sr. would get about $1.5 million, plus Johnson would pay off the remaining mortgage and assume the $400,000–$800,000 debt to the concessionaires. Very little of Johnson's own cash would be involved: the deal depended on real estate and the eagerness of the Kansas City town fathers to take on debt to snag a major league franchise.|$|E
25|$|However, in 1996, the Astros again nearly left Houston. By the mid-1990s, McLane (like McMullen before him) {{wanted his}} team {{out of the}} Astrodome and was asking the city to build the Astros a new stadium. When things did not {{progress}} quickly toward that end, he put the team up for sale. He had nearly finalized a deal to sell the team to businessman William Collins, who planned to <b>move</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Northern Virginia. However, Collins was having difficulty finding a site for a stadium himself, so Major League owners stepped in and forced McLane to give Houston another chance to grant his stadium wish. Houston voters responded positively via a stadium referendum and the Astros stayed put.|$|E
