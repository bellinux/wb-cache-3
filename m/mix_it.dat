5|$|The band did not {{consider}} the album to be important and only Glover and Paice showed up to <b>mix</b> <b>it.</b> According to Birch, Gillan and Blackmore have never heard the finished album.

5|$|The ink sac of an octopus {{is located}} under the {{digestive}} gland. A gland {{attached to the}} sac produces the ink, and the sac stores it. The sac is {{close enough to the}} funnel for the octopus to shoot out the ink with a water jet. Before it leaves the funnel, the ink passes through glands which <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> with mucus, creating a thick, dark blob which allows the animal to escape from a predator. The main pigment in the ink is melanin, which gives it its black colour. Cirrate octopuses lack the ink sac.|$|E

5|$|Adams {{did not use}} the 3D {{graphics}} which Armok {{had since}} its development was hampered because of it. He cited the ease in development of features like fluid simulation, copyright issues with the art and more unhindered possibilities as further reasons for not using it. Being used to the text-based graphics in roguelikes, he did not want graphical tilesets. The story-generation originated first from Armok, although present to some extent in dragslay. Tarn and Zach would write different chapters of events they would like to see, <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> together and try to implement it. Most of this story writing is managed by Zach, who has a role in the game's development. He graduated in ancient history and books like The Twelve Caesars and the writings of Assyrian kings influenced the game.|$|E
5|$|Peace Sells... but Who's Buying? is {{the second}} studio album and major label debut by the American thrash metal band Megadeth, {{released}} on September 19, 1986 by Capitol Records. The project was originally handled by Combat Records, resulting in the first mix of the album being co-produced by Randy Burns. Capitol Records then bought {{the rights to the}} album and hired another producer, Paul Lani, to <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> himself. The recording of the album was difficult for the band, because of the ongoing drug issues the members had at the time. This was the last Megadeth album to feature drummer Gar Samuelson and guitarist Chris Poland, who were fired shortly after the album's promotional tour for drug abuse. The title track, noted for its politically conscious lyrics, was released as the album's lead single.|$|E
5|$|Nada Es Igual... was {{released}} on 20 August 1996. On its launch date, Warner Music Group shipped over 400,000 copies of the record in Mexico and the United States (US). In the US, it debuted at number 28 on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart on week of 31 August 1996, and peaked {{on top of the}} chart the following week replacing Macarena <b>Mix.</b> <b>It</b> spent two weeks on top of the charts before being succeeded by Macarena Non Stop by Los del Río. It was certified gold in the US by the Recording Industry Association of Amerca (RIAA) for shipments of 500,000 copies and ended 1996 as the eighth bestselling Latin album of the year. In Argentina, the record reached number one on its national chart and was certified 7 platinum by Argentine Chamber of Phonograms and Videograms Producers (CAPIF) for sales of 420,000 copies. In Spain, the album peaked at number two on the country's national chart with the number one position being held by Lunas Rotas by Rosana and was certified double platinum by PROMUSICAE for shipments of 200,000 copies.

It {{is the main}} {{intersection}} with DSB's intercity and regional trains, {{as well as the}} S-train, serving lines A, B, C, E and H. Kongens Nytorv {{lies at the heart of}} the commercial and cultural center of Copenhagen. When the City Circle Line opens, the station will serve as the transfer to lines M3 and M4. Christianshavn is located on an island, a former navy base that has been redeveloped into residential and commercial <b>mix.</b> <b>It</b> is the last station served by both lines, with M1 branching off towards Islands Brygge.|$|E
25|$|Plants {{designed}} for lignite (brown coal) are increasingly used in locations {{as varied as}} Germany, Victoria, Australia and North Dakota. Lignite is a much younger form of coal than black coal. It has a lower energy density than black coal and requires a much larger furnace for equivalent heat output. Such coals may contain up to 70% water and ash, yielding lower furnace temperatures and requiring larger induced-draft fans. The firing systems also differ from black coal and typically draw hot gas from the furnace-exit level and <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> with the incoming coal in fan-type mills that inject the pulverized coal and hot gas mixture into the boiler.|$|E
25|$|Mach3 {{performance}} in the 1950s was difficult to achieve. Jet engines compress incoming air, then <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> with fuel and ignite the mixture. The resulting expansion of gases produces thrust. The compressors generally can ingest air only at subsonic speeds. To operate supersonically, aircraft use advanced intakes to slow the supersonic air to a usable speed. The energy lost in this process heats the air, which means the engine has to operate at ever-higher temperatures to provide net thrust. The limiting factor in this process is {{the temperature of the}} materials in the engines, in particular, the turbine blades just behind the combustion chambers. Using materials available at the time, speeds much beyond Mach2.5 were difficult to achieve.|$|E

25|$|To {{limit the}} {{environmental}} impact of returning the brine to the ocean, it can be diluted with another stream of water entering the ocean, such as the outfall of a wastewater treatment or power plant. With medium to large power plant and desalination plants, the power plant's cooling water flow is likely to be several times larger than that of the desalination plant, reducing the salinity of the combination. Another method to dilute the brine is to <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> via a diffuser in a mixing zone. For example, once a pipeline containing the brine reaches the sea floor, it can split into many branches, each releasing brine gradually through small holes along its length. Mixing can be combined with power plant or wastewater plant dilution.|$|E
25|$|Upon its release, {{the album}} {{received}} generally positive reviews from music critics, who noted {{her ability to}} catch an old-school jazz sound and <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> with R and soul melodies. The album earned Keys several awards and accolades, including five Grammy Awards at the 44th Grammy Awards. Songs in A Minor debuted at {{number one on the}} Billboard 200 chart, selling over 236,000 copies in its first week. It has sold over 6.2 million copies in the United States and 16 million copies worldwide. Rolling Stone magazine named Songs in A Minor the second best album of 2001, while ranking it number 95 on its list of the best albums of the 2000s decade. In 2013 Entertainment Weekly ranked the album at the 57th position among the greatest albums of all time.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion of}} honor is another social {{characteristic}} Holý identifies as being related to Middle Eastern cousin marriage. The {{honor of the}} males surrounding a woman is sullied in many societies when she misbehaves or when she is attacked. In societies like Europe that place greater value on affinal relations, responsibility for a married woman rests with both her husband's family and her own. In the Middle East the situation is different in that primary responsibility continues to rest with the woman's own family even after she is married. Her agnates therefore cannot release her from control upon marriage due to the risk to their honor. They and not the husband {{may be responsible for}} killing her, or sometimes her lover, if she commits adultery. Similar rules may apply in case of the payment if she is killed and for the inheritance of her property if she has no male heirs. Her natal family may continue supporting her even against her husband. This is an idealized system: some Middle Eastern societies do <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> with other systems that assign more responsibility to the husband's family.|$|E

25|$|The McFlurry is a soft-serve {{ice cream}} dessert that has pieces of candy or cookies mixed into it. The McFlurry was first {{integrated}} into the menu at a Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada franchisee in 1995 and in the United States in 1998. The flavors are crushed Oreo, M's Minis, Reese's, or Mars, Incorporated candy bars like Snickers, Twix, Galaxy, etc., Cadbury's candy bars like Twirl, Wispa, Creme Egg, Crunchie etc., Nestlé candy bars like Yorkie, Smarties, Drifter, Rolo, Butterfinger, etc. McDonald's also does limited time only flavors, e.g. for Shrek the Third it released the Ogre-Load flavor. In Australia, they had a special range for their 40 years in Australia celebration. The flavors were double choc fudge, bubblegum squash, strawberry crumble and caramel cookie. Also in Malaysia, a unique flavor called FuseofmyLife is offered to customers. The mixing blade for the dessert is actually a specially designed spoon with a hollow handle that attaches to the mixer spindle (except in Australia and New Zealand where the staff <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> by hand). The blade is used once then given to the customer to use as an eating utensil. Originally test marketed in Hawaii in 1997, it is now available in most of its markets.|$|E
