5|$|Carpenter faced <b>many</b> <b>problems</b> {{associated}} with this, including {{the possibility of}} the Indians being rescued by their followers or being lynched by angry settlers, during their transport to the civilian court. During transport, Satank hid himself under his red blanket in his wagon while he gnawed the base of his thumb to the bone. This allowed him to slip the manacle from his wrist while he sang his death chant. With a small hidden knife that was not found during two separate searches, he stabbed the driver (who survived), both falling out of the wagon, grabbed a soldier's unloaded carbine and was mortally wounded in his escape attempt.|$|E
40|$|The {{solutions}} of <b>many</b> engineering <b>problems</b> can be formulated as the optimized {{results of}} a functional. While <b>many</b> engineering <b>problems</b> are governed by a continuous convex optimization process, {{this is not the}} case for <b>many</b> geotechnical <b>problems.</b> <b>Many</b> geotechnical <b>problems</b> have irregular solution domains, with the objective function being nonconvex and may not be a continuous function. The presence of multiple local minima is common in <b>many</b> geotechnical <b>problems,</b> and the occurrence of local zones where there is rapid changes in the material parameters is not uncommon. The corresponding governing problems are hence usually NP-type nonconvex optimization problem, and by nature, such NP-type problems with the various constraints pose great difficulty in analysis. While the classical heuristic optimization methods may work well for some of these problems, there are also some practical cases where the classical methods may fail to perform satisfactorily. To maintain a balance between the computation time and accuracy, several hybrid metaheuristic algorithms are proposed by the author which can work well for <b>many</b> practical geotechnical <b>problems.</b> In this chapter, the author will illustrate the basic concept of hybrid metaheuristic algorithms and the applications to some difficult geotechnical problems.

However, the lack of supporting infrastructure for constructing, implementing, and maintaining visual languages in general and domain-specific visual languages (DSVLs) in particular has been an impediment to gaining wider acceptance.
