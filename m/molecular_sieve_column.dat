40|$|A {{biochemical}} assay that {{is designed}} to detect recombination intermediates formed in vitro is described. The assay measures the fusion of two essentially homologous plasmids, one of which is radioactively labeled and the other of which carries several copies of the lac operator. The fusion product is radioactive and can be bound to a nitrocellulose filter by lac repressor. This assay for genome fusion is rapid and readily applicable to the many fractions that result during enzyme purification. The fused product is not destroyed in the assay and may be recovered from the filter for further analysis by electron microscopy. The product is then seen to consist of figure 8 structures that can be cleaved by the restriction enzyme EcoRI to give chi forms, structures similar to those recovered from recombination-proficient cells. It is expected that this assay will be useful in the purification of the "recombinase-type" activity detected in crude cell lysates.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{activation}} of cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling pathways in vascular smooth muscle {{is important for}} the prevention of vein graft spasm and neointimal hyperplasia. Cyclic nucleotide-dependent relaxation is associated with an increase in the phosphorylation of a small heat shock-related protein (HSP 20). In this investigation, we examined the mechanisms by which HSP 20 may modulate relaxation. Methods: The relaxation responses of the bovine carotid artery smooth muscles were determined in a muscle bath. HSP 20 phosphorylation was quantitated with isoelectric-focusing immunoblots. The association with actin was determined with coimmunoprecipitation and cosedimentation. <b>Molecular</b> <b>sieving</b> <b>columns</b> were used to examine the macromolecular associations of HSP 20. Results: The {{activation of}} cyclic nucleotide signaling pathways leads to the complete relaxation of carotid smooth muscle. This relaxation response is associated with an increase in the phosphorylation of HSP 20. Actin coimmunoprecipitated with HSP 20, and the association of actin with recombinant HSP 20 in vitro was phosphorylation-state dependent. Finally, HSP 20 exists in large (> 100 kDa) aggregates, which dissociate with the activation of cyclic nucleotide signaling pathways. Conclusion: These data support a role of HSP 20 phosphorylation in mediating smooth muscle relaxation, possibly via a direct interaction of large aggregates of HSP 20 with the contractile elements.

Farnesyl pyrophosphate (Km = 0. 5 micromolar) in combination with isopentenyl pyrophosphate (Km = 3. 5 micromolar) was the most effective substrate for the production of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Geranyl pyrophosphate (Km = 24 micromolar) could replace farnesyl pyrophosphate as the allylic pyrophosphate substrate, but dimethylallyl pyrophosphate was not utilized by the enzyme. One peak of farnesyl transferase activity (geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthetase) and two peaks of geranyl transferase activity (farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetases) from extracts of whole elicited seedlings were resolved by DEAE A- 25 Sephadex sievorptive ion exchange chromatography.

Xanthan depolymerase cleaves the endo-β- 1, 4 -glucosidic linkage of the xanthan molecule, freeing reducing groups of some sugars and decreasing viscosity of the polymer solution. Only the backbones of β- 1, 4 -linked glucans with side chains or other substituents were cleaved. No monosaccharide was produced {{by the action of}} this enzyme. The oligosac-charide(s) in the low-molecular weight fraction consisted of 15 to 58 monosaccharide units. The enzymic reaction resulted in the decrease in weight-average molecular weight of xanthan from 6. 5 × 106 to 8. 0 × 105 in 0. 5 h. This enzyme alone could not degrade xanthan to a single or multiple pentasaccharide unit(s). Results suggest that there may be regions inside the xanthan molecule that are susceptible to the attack of this enzyme. Xanthan depolymerase activity was not inhibited by many chemicals, including thiols, antioxidants, chlorinated hydrocarbons, metal-chelating agents, and inorganic compounds, except ferric chloride and arsenomolybdate. Many biocides were tested and found not to be inhibitory. Conditions used in enhanced oil recovery operations, i. e., the presence of formaldehyde, Na 2 S 2 O 4, 2, 2 -dibromo- 3 -nitrilopropionamide, and an anaerobic environment, did not inhibit xanthan depolymerase activity...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{determination}} of CO content in blood is described. Carbon mon-oxide bound to hemoglobin is released by hemolysis and reaction with K 3 Fe (CN) in a closed system. The gases liberated are then swept onto a 5 A <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> <b>column</b> where CO is separated from other blood gases. The CO, after catalytic reduc-tion to methane, is detected by flame ionization. The method is rapid, specific, and sufficiently sensitive to permit analysis of 0. 1 -mi. samples of normal blood. The accuracy of the method, expressed as the coefficient of variation (S. D. X 100 /mean), is 1. 8 % for normal human blood. STUDIES BY Sjostralld (1,. 2) and Coburn et al. (3) have showli that carbon monoxide is a normal excretory product in man. Endogenous (‘ 0 production has been demonstrated to arise principally from re-moval of the alpha methene carbon of heme (luring bile pigment forma-tion (4). The rate of CO formation {{has been used as}} a substitute for radiochromium to estimate mean erythrocyte life span (5). Special technics are required for CO analysis of blood because of the low con-centration of this gas under all conditions except severe CO poisoning. The methods of Coburn et al. (6), Si#{ 246 }steenand Sj#{ 246 }strand (7), and Gaensler et at. (8) are the most satisfactory procedures currently avail-able.

40|$|Activation of the kallikrein–kinin {{system in}} lung injury {{has long been}} recognized. However, the effects of {{bradykinin}} (BK) on human lung fibroblasts (HLF) remain to be elucidated. We determined whether BK stimulates HLF to release chemotactic activity for neutrophils and monocytes (NCA and MCA, respectively). We evaluated HLF supernatant fluids for chemotactic activity through a blind-well chamber technique. HLF released NCA and MCA in a dose- and time-dependent manner in response to BK. The release of chemotactic activity was inhibited by lipoxygenase inhibitors and cycloheximide. <b>Molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> <b>column</b> chromatography revealed that both NCA and MCA had multiple chemotactic peaks. NCA was inhibited by a leukotriene (LT) B 4 receptor antagonist and by antibodies to interleukin (IL) - 8 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). MCA was attenuated by the LTB 4 receptor antagonist and by antibodies to monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and transforming growth factor (TGF) -�. Both the LTB 4 receptor antagonist and these antibodies inhibited chemotactic activity of the molecular weights corresponding to MCP- 1, GM-CSF, and TGF-�, separated by column chromatography. The concentrations of IL- 8, G-CSF, MCP- 1, GM-CSF, and TGF- � in supernatant fluids increased significantly in a time-dependent manner in response to BK. The receptors responsible {{for the release of}} NCA, MCA, and individual chemokines included both BKB 1 and BKB 2 receptors. These data suggest that BK may stimulate lung fibroblasts to release inflammatory cytokines, which may modulate lung inflammation. Koyama, S., E. Sato, H. Numanami, K. Kubo, S. Nagai, and T.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{evaluated}} {{the potential of}} bradykinin (BK) to induce the release of neutrophil and monocyte chemotactic activity (NCA and MCA) and cytokines from an alveolar type II epithelial cell line, A 549 cells. BK stimulated A 549 cells to release NCA and MCA in a dose- and time-dependent manner (P < 0. 001). Checkerboard analysis revealed that both NCA and MCA involved chemotactic and chemokinetic activity. <b>Molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> <b>column</b> chromatography showed three molecular weight masses (near 19 kd, 8 kd, and 400 d) for NCA and several molecular weight peaks (near 66 kd, 25 kd, 19 kd, 16 kd, and 400 d) for MCA. The release of NCA and MCA was inhibited by cycloheximide and lipoxygenase inhibitors (P < 0. 01). The NCA and MCA were inhibited by leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) receptor antagonist (P < 0. 01), and the concentration of LTB 4 was high enough for NCA and MCA. Antibodies to interleukin (IL) - 8 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) attenuated NCA (P < 0. 01), and antibodies to monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP- 1), G-CSF, and transforming growth factor (TGF) -β attenuated MCA (P < 0. 01). The levels of IL- 8, G-CSF, MCP- 1, and TGF-β increased time dependently (P < 0. 01). BK also stimulated the release of ILeukin- 6 from A 549 cells (P < 0. 001).

40|$|IgG anti-IgE autoantibodies {{in human}} {{allergic}} sera {{have been investigated}} using an enzyme immunoassay on microplates coated with anti-human IgE MoAb. After incubation with serum, the plates were developed with peroxidase-labelled anti-human IgE MoAb for the determination of total IgE levels, or with anti-IgG MoAb for evaluating IgG anti-IgE autoantibodies. Using this methodology, no correlation was found between total IgE and IgG anti-IgE levels in groups of sera of allergic individuals. Although the results obtained with enzyme-labelled anti-IgG are often interpreted as indicative of IgE-IgG complexes captured from the serum, <b>molecular</b> <b>sieving</b> on gel <b>columns</b> as well as direct ultrafiltration experiments through 300 -kD membranes demonstrate that such complexes do not occur preformed in the circulation, but arise de novo on the anti-IgE-coated solid phase during in vitro incubation with human serum.
