40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the role of}} music and musical sounds in Butterfly Burning by Yvonne Vera. It analyses the way that Vera has used music interlinked with {{the action of the}} novel.   This thesis analyses a few areas where music is represented and is important such as: <b>music</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> element of healing/forgiveness; <b>music</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> element of hope; <b>music</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> element of despair; <b>music</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> element of working life and the absence of music.   This thesis also briefly discusses who the narrator of the novel is and Vera’s writing technique that incorporates images with hypothetical sounds.   The conclusion shows that music and musical sounds are important to the novel.   It also shows that the music in Butterfly Burning can be compared to the music in a film.   Vera has managed to combine the story of the novel and the description of music so that it becomes one inseparable unit...|$|R

5|$|Although As I Lay Dying {{has stated}} on {{numerous}} occasions {{that all of the}} members of the group are practicing Christians, the band is usually described by media as being in the metalcore genre, not Christian metal. This is largely because the band's lyrics do not directly focus on pro-Christian themes the way many praise music bands do nor do they treat their <b>music</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> direct extension of their private Christian worship or proselytizing efforts. For example, not once do the names God or Jesus appear in any As I Lay Dying song, nor do any of their songs explicitly invoke Christian doctrine or quote the Bible. Most songs tend to address broader spiritual concepts like existential angst or the struggle between reason and spirituality.|$|E
