In most cases, the Council votes on issues by qualified majority voting, meaning that there must be a minimum of 55% of <b>member</b> <b>states</b> agreeing (at least 15) who together represent at least 65% of the EU population. A 'blocking minority' can only be formed by at least 4 <b>member</b> <b>states</b> representing at least 35% of the EU population.|$|E
5|$|The European Council {{consists}} of the heads of state or government of the <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> alongside its own President and the Commission President (both non-voting).

5|$|The {{number of}} {{stars on the}} flag is fixed at 12, and {{is not related to}} the number of <b>member</b> <b>states</b> of the EU (although the EU did have 12 <b>member</b> <b>states</b> at the time of Maastricht Treaty). This is because it {{originally}} was the flag of the Council of Europe. In 1953, the Council of Europe had 15 members; it was proposed that the future flag should have one star for each member, and would not change based on future members. West Germany objected to this as one of the members was the disputed area of Saarland, and to have its own star would imply sovereignty for the region. Twelve was eventually adopted as a number with no political connotations and as a symbol of unity. While 12 is the correct number of stars, sometimes flags or emblems can be found that incorrectly show 15 (as of the rejected proposal) or 25 (as suggested by some after the expansion of the EU to 25 <b>member</b> <b>states</b> in 2004). However, the flag also remains that of the Council of Europe, which now has 47 <b>member</b> <b>states.</b>|$|E
