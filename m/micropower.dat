2500|$|Microgeneration is the {{small-scale}} {{generation of}} heat and electric power by individuals, small businesses and communities to meet their own needs, as alternatives or supplements to traditional centralized grid-connected power. [...] Although this may be motivated by practical considerations, such as unreliable grid power or long distance from the electrical grid, the term is mainly used currently for environmentally conscious approaches that aspire to zero or low-carbon footprints or cost reduction. It differs from <b>micropower</b> {{in that it is}} principally concerned with fixed power plants rather than for use with mobile devices.|$|E
40|$|<b>Micropower’s</b> 6 - 10 KW {{converter}} {{has a small}} capacitance at {{the input}} of the converter. The line inductance can be big and then possibly induce oscillations onto the input of the converter. After a detailed study on the converter system, {{it is observed that}} the frequency is almost same when the system starts oscillating with higher amplitude. The aim of the thesis is to design the system mathematically using a state space representation and simulating the model to describe why it can oscillate. A systematic procedure is explained. Inorder to validate, the simulation results are verified with the experimental results conducted on the physical converter...|$|R

It is deliberated the deleuzian concept of virtual possibilities of thinking about creation in school, unlike the catastrophic thoughts about his impending end, as well as their inadequacy to the present time. The juncture point of these two angles is constituted by a statement about the strata in A Thousand Plateaus: “Isn’t it required to save a minimum of layers, a minimum of forms and functions, a minimum of subjects to extract material affects, and assemblages?” (DELEUZE; GUATTARI, 1997, p. 60) ...|$|R

Cohn from the Naval Research Laboratory state that MESFETs on SOI substrates are suitable for applications from -180°C and 250°C and have been demonstrated to operate through 5 Mrad of total ionizing dose.

2500|$|In {{the context}} of {{wireless}} power, energy harvesting, also called power harvesting or energy scavenging, is the conversion of ambient energy from the environment to electric power, mainly to power small autonomous wireless electronic devices. [...] The ambient energy may come from stray electric or magnetic fields or radio waves [...] from nearby electrical equipment, light, thermal energy (heat), or kinetic energy such as vibration or motion of the device. [...] Although the efficiency of conversion is usually low and the power gathered often minuscule (milliwatts or microwatts), it can be adequate to run or recharge small <b>micropower</b> wireless devices such as remote sensors, which are proliferating in many fields. [...] This new technology is being developed to {{eliminate the need for}} battery replacement or charging of such wireless devices, allowing them to operate completely autonomously.|$|E
2500|$|Slewing: The amplifier's {{output voltage}} reaches its maximum rate of change, the slew rate, usually {{specified}} in volts per microsecond. When slewing occurs, further {{increases in the}} input signal {{have no effect on}} the rate of change of the output. Slewing is usually caused by the input stage saturating; the result is a constant current [...] driving a capacitance [...] in the amplifier (especially those capacitances used to implement its frequency compensation); the slew rate is limited by [...]Slewing is associated with the large-signal performance of an op-amp. [...] Consider, for example, an op-amp configured for a gain of 10. [...] Let the input be a 1 V, 100kHz sawtooth wave. That is, the amplitude is 1 V and the period is 10 microseconds. Accordingly, the rate of change (i.e., the slope) of the input is 0.1 V per microsecond. [...] After 10x amplification, the output should be a 10 V, [...] 100kHz sawtooth, with a corresponding slew rate of 1 V per microsecond. [...] However, the classic 741 op-amp has a 0.5 V per microsecond slew rate specification, so that its output can rise to no more than 5 V in the sawtooth's 10 microsecond period. Thus, if one were to measure the output, it would be a 5 V, 100kHz sawtooth, rather than a 10 V, 100kHz sawtooth.Next consider the same amplifier and 100kHz sawtooth, but now the input amplitude is 100 mV rather than 1 V. [...] After 10x amplification the output is a 1 V, 100kHz sawtooth with a corresponding slew rate of 0.1 V per microsecond. [...] In this instance the 741 with its 0.5 V per microsecond slew rate will amplify the input properly.Modern high speed op-amps can have slew rates in excess of 5,000 V per microsecond. However, it is more common for op-amps to have slew rates in the range 5-100 V per microsecond. [...] For example, the general purpose TL081 op-amp has a slew rate of 13 V per microsecond. [...] As a general rule, low power and small bandwidth op-amps have low slew rates. [...] As an example, the LT1494 <b>micropower</b> op-amp consumes 1.5 microamp but has a 2.7kHz gain-bandwidth product and a 0.001 V per microsecond slew rate.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Micropower</b> {{radio is}} {{a subset of}} pirate radio {{concerned}} with low-power radio broadcasting, usually less than about 100 watts radiated power and sometimes less than 0.1 watt. <b>Micropower</b> radio transmits {{to a number of}} recipients ("listeners" [...] or [...] "viewers") that belong to a small local group.
