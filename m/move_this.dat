5|$|During {{his time}} with Shrewsbury, Davis {{extended}} his contract with Wolves until 2013. He made his debut for the club in the League Cup second-round tie away to Northampton Town on 23 August 2011, coming off the bench {{for the last few}} minutes as Wolves won 4–0. A week later, he made yet another loan <b>move,</b> <b>this</b> time to Scottish Premier League (SPL) side Inverness Caledonian Thistle until January 2012.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} {{to play the game}} with just two players (one per team) by having each player move on two boards. Analogously to simultaneous chess, this way of playing the game is referred to as simultaneous bughouse. It can also be played with just one clock by playing the boards in a specific order (WhiteA, WhiteB, BlackB, BlackA) and pressing the clock after each <b>move.</b> <b>This</b> variation is suitable for play by mail.|$|E

5|$|Replenishment ships, {{known as}} oilers in the United States and fleet tankers in Commonwealth countries, are ships {{that can provide}} oil {{products}} to naval vessels while on the <b>move.</b> <b>This</b> process, called underway replenishment, extends {{the length of time}} a naval vessel can stay at sea, as well as her effective range. Prior to underway replenishment, naval vessels had to enter a port or anchor to take on fuel. In addition to fuel, replenishment ships may also deliver water, ammunition, rations, stores and personnel.|$|E
5|$|After calling {{time on his}} Forest career, Mills {{was once}} again on the <b>move,</b> <b>this</b> time to Forest's {{neighbours}} Notts County on 14 August 1987. His debut came one day after joining, starting County's 4–4 home draw with Wigan Athletic on {{the opening day of}} the 1987–88 Third Division. He first scored for County with their opening goal in a 2–1 away win over Chester City on 3 October 1987. Mills played in all of County's matches in 1987–88, making 60 appearances and scoring five goals, and was named the club's Player of the Year. County reached the Southern Area final of the Associate Members' Cup, being beaten 4–1 on aggregate by Wolverhampton Wanderers. With County finishing fourth in the table they qualified for the Third Division play-offs, in which they were beaten 4–2 on aggregate by Walsall in the semi-final. He missed only three matches while a County player in 1988–89, making 36 appearances and scoring four goals.|$|E
5|$|Embarking on the Mt Vernon in Port Tewfik, the {{battalion}} sailed from Egypt in early February and arrived in Adelaide, South Australia, in mid-March. After this, {{the battalion}} camped at Woodside, in the Adelaide Hills, where {{a period of}} re-conditioning and exercises followed until mid-April when {{the majority of its}} personnel were sent on home leave. At the end of the month, those that remained undertook a five-day train journey to Casino, New South Wales. Limited training was undertaken until mid-May, around which time orders were received for another <b>move,</b> <b>this</b> time to Caboolture, Queensland. By the end of the month, the battalion returned to almost full strength when the final leave draft returned. At the time, the strategic situation in the Pacific was in the balance; the Japanese were advancing south and due to concerns about a possible Japanese invasion, the 25th Brigade was tasked with defending the coastal area north of Brisbane.|$|E

5|$|In 916 Emperor Taizu (Abaoji) officially {{designated}} {{his eldest}} son, Yelü Bei, as his successor. Succession by primogeniture was a long-held standard in Chinese culture {{but was not}} accepted among the Khitans, creating a friction between Taizu's desires and the beliefs of the Khitan elites, including Taizu's wife, Empress Shulü Ping. Taizu, sensing {{the possibility that the}} succession process would run into difficulty, forced the Khitan leadership to swear allegiance to Yelü Bei after he was installed as heir apparent. To the Khitans, this was considered a radical <b>move.</b> <b>This</b> friction between primogeniture and succession by the strongest candidate would lead to repeated succession crises, the first of which occurred after Taizu's sudden and unexpected death in 926.|$|E
5|$|In July, British {{forces were}} sent from India {{to relieve the}} Australian troops in Ceylon. Preparations were made for the 2/3rd Battalion to return to Australia, and after embarking upon the SS Westernland, they arrived in Melbourne on 8 August 1942, having {{returned}} via the southern route away from the Japanese submarines patrolling the east coast. After this, the troops all received two weeks home leave, staggered {{from the time of}} their arrival. The final group had their leave cut short after only three days, however, when they were recalled by urgent telegram. The 16th Brigade was again on the <b>move,</b> <b>this</b> time to Port Moresby in New Guinea, where the fighting against the Japanese along the Kokoda Track was reaching a critical stage. After a short voyage, the brigade arrived at Port Moresby on 21 September 1942.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{televised}} match, Randy Orton faced Kurt Angle. In {{the early stages}} both superstars took the advantage over one another. Angle controlled most of the match, as Orton tried to avoid Angle's assaults. Angle tried to perform a suplex on Orton off the ring apron, but did not perform the <b>move.</b> <b>This</b> was followed by Angle performing a belly to back suplex on Orton on the outside ring floor. Mid-way in the match, Orton attempted to perform an RKO by jumping and grabbing Angle's head to drive it over his shoulders, but he countered by pushing Orton to the turnbuckle. Orton took the padding off the turnbuckle, leaving it exposed. Following this, Angle began performing a series of German suplexes on Orton. Angle then applied the ankle lock hold. Orton, however, flipped over and sent Angle face-first into the exposed turnbuckle. As he turned around, Orton performed the RKO, and covered Angle to gain the pinfall victory.|$|E

5|$|Most gunfights {{are portrayed}} in films or books as having two men square off, waiting {{for one to}} make the first <b>move.</b> <b>This</b> was rarely the case. Often, a gunfight was spur-of-the-moment, with one drawing his pistol, and the other reacting. Often it would develop into a shootout where both men bolted for cover. In popular folklore, men who held {{noteworthy}} reputations as a gunfighter were eager to match up against another gunman with the same reputation. On the contrary, in cases where two men held a similar reputation, both would avoid confrontation with one another whenever possible. They rarely took undue risks, and usually weighed their options before confronting another well-known gunman. This respect for one another is why most famous gunfights were rarely two or more well-known gunmen matched up against one another, but rather one notable gunman against a lesser-known opponent or opponents.|$|E
5|$|Sunderland {{have had}} seven stadiums {{throughout}} their history; {{the first was}} at Blue House Field in Hendon in 1879. The ground {{was close to the}} place where Sunderland formed, at Hendon Board School; at that time the rent for use of the ground was £10 (£ today). The club relocated briefly to Groves Field in Ashbrooke in 1882, before moving again the following season. The club's third stadium was Horatio Street in Roker, the first Sunderland stadium north of the River Wear; the club played a single season there before another <b>move,</b> <b>this</b> time to Abbs Field in Fulwell for two seasons. Abbs Field was notable for being the first Sunderland ground to which they charged admission.|$|E
5|$|To {{mark the}} game's fifteenth anniversary, a port for the Game Boy Advance, titled Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis, was {{released}} on November 14, 2006. While the port is mostly identical to the original, it includes several new features not seen in the original Genesis release, {{such as the ability}} to save game progress, a level select option, and inclusion of the Spin Dash <b>move.</b> <b>This</b> version of the game, unlike others, received poor reviews, with a Metacritic score of 33/100. The chief complaints concerned its poor conversion to the Game Boy Advance, resulting in a bad performance and poor implementation of the original music and gameplay.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{they were}} ordered to Roslavl, {{south-east}} of Smolensk, but this was soon changed to Yelnya, east of Smolensk. When they reached Smolensk, they marched on through Yartsevo to Safonovo before being ordered to turn north towards Bely to help stop a Soviet breakthrough south of Rzhev. At {{the head of the}} division, the 25th Panzergrenadier Regiment attacked off the route of march towards elements of the 1st Panzer Division holding out around the village of Komary. The fighting continued in snowstorms and extreme cold until 16 December, with Mickl forward directing the battle, which ended with the destruction of eight Soviet tank and rifle brigades in the Bely area. After a few days rest, on 23 December Mickl's regiment marched to the north-east of Bely to stop Soviet forces moving into the Luchesa river valley. In the difficult terrain and weather conditions, the regiment was exhausted from constant fighting over hamlets that often changed hands. On 30 December, the fighting escalated as the Red Army forces in the sector were reinforced, and Mickl's II Battalion was forced to temporarily withdraw into the surrounding forest. Fierce fighting continued until the 12th Panzer Division was detached at short notice on 14 January 1943, but not before the divisional staff had reported Mickl's brave leadership in the fighting to the Oberkommando des Heeres (German Army High Command). On 16 January 1943, the division was on the <b>move,</b> <b>this</b> time headed north-west to Velikiye Luki, but its move to the front was countermanded.|$|E
5|$|Poliomyelitis, {{often called}} polio or {{infantile}} paralysis, is an infectious disease {{caused by the}} poliovirus. In about 0.5 percent of cases there is muscle weakness resulting in an inability to <b>move.</b> <b>This</b> can occur over {{a few hours to}} a few days. The weakness most often involves the legs but may less commonly involve the muscles of the head, neck and diaphragm. Many but not all people fully recover. In those with muscle weakness about 2 to 5 percent of children and 15 to 30 percent of adults die. Another 25 percent of people have minor symptoms such as fever and a sore throat and up to 5 percent have headache, neck stiffness and pains in the arms and legs. These people are usually back to normal within one or two weeks. In up to 70 percent of infections there are no symptoms. Years after recovery post-polio syndrome may occur, with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to that which the person had during the initial infection.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the year, the South Pacific High {{influences}} the climate by bringing cold, moist air masses originating from Patagonia. During {{the most intense}} cold waves, they form when a transient high pressure system located in the South Pacific Ocean moves eastwards to {{the southern tip of}} South America. As it begins to <b>move,</b> <b>this</b> high pressure system strengthens the South Pacific High and is forced to move southwards to south of 40oS where the Andes are shorter in height. As well, an upper level ridge forms over the South Pacific Ocean along with an upper level trough extending from subtropical latitudes to the South Atlantic Ocean. At the same time, a low pressure system forms over the South Atlantic Ocean which eventually strengthens. The formation a cold front associated with it moves to the northeast owing to the topographic barrier that the Andes forms. The passage of the cold front to the northeast leads to the movement of the high pressure system from the South Pacific Ocean into the southern tip of South America. All of these conditions lead to strong anticyclogenesis to the east of the Andes and thus, the high pressure system intensifies as it enters southern Argentina. When both the high pressure system (over southern Argentina) and low pressure system strengthen, it creates a very strong pressure gradient that draws cold air from the south, strengthening southerly winds. Owing to the topographic barrier of the Andes, it forces and channels the cold air to accumulate on {{the eastern side of the}} Andes. This generates an ageostropic component from the south (due to a reduction in the Coriolis force caused by accumulation of cold air on the eastern side of the Andes) that draw this cold air northwards, which is driven by this pressure gradient. Cold air can move northwards until 18oS when the blocking effect of the Andes is smaller due to a change in its orientation. Overall, these conditions results in the coldest temperatures due to the cold masses from high latitudes being pulled northwards. A weaker cold wave occurs when the South Pacific High remains over the ocean and does not have a migratory high pressure system originating from the South Pacific High that moves east of the Andes (it builds over the Andes). Although this occurs throughout the year, during winters, it leads to cold temperatures while during summer, it leads to strong and deep convections. These convections are responsible for about 50% of summer precipitation south of 25oS.|$|E
