25|$|Not long after, Anas {{spoke to}} Abdullah Azzam {{about the need}} to ensure Muslim help reached {{northern}} Afghanistan, and not just that of Western NGOs. Azzam appointed Khadr in charge of a new charity to be affiliated with the <b>Muslim</b> <b>World</b> <b>League</b> NGO.

It plays a prominent role in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and in 2005 joined the World Trade Organization. Saudi Arabia supports the intended formation of the Arab Customs Union in 2015 and an Arab common market by 2020, as announced at the 2009 Arab League summit.|$|E
50|$|It was {{the first}} planned Islamic {{community}} in the United States. It was originally co-founded in 1979 by Nooruddeen Durkee, an American convert to Islam, Sahl Kabbani, a Saudi businessman and Abdullah Naseef, the former secretary-general of the <b>World</b> <b>Muslim</b> <b>League.</b> Kabbani reportedly contributed $125,000 to the non-profit Lama Foundation that was formed to create the community, while {{the bulk of the}} start up funds were said to have come from the Riyadh Ladies’ Benevolent Association of Saudi Arabia, the late King Khalid of Saudi Arabia, and two of his daughters.|$|R
5000|$|The Izala Society -- a Wahhabi missionary group {{established}} 1978 -- {{has become}} one of the largest Islamic societies in Nigeria, Chad, Niger, and Cameroon. [...] Izala is funded by Saudi Arabia and led by the <b>World</b> <b>Muslim</b> <b>League.</b> It fights what it sees as the bid’a, (innovation), practiced by the Sufi brotherhoods, specifically the Qadiri and Tijan Sufi orders. It is very active in education and Da‘wa (propagation of the faith) and in Nigeria has many institutions all over the country and is influential at the local, state, and even federal levels.|$|R
5000|$|Relatively recently, Salafism {{has begun}} {{spreading}} in Africa, {{as a result}} of many Muslim Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) such as the <b>World</b> <b>Muslim</b> <b>League,</b> the <b>World</b> Assembly for <b>Muslim</b> Youth, and the Federation of Mab and Islamic Schools primarily funded by Salafi governments in the Arab Gulf. These Salafist organizations, often based out of Saudi Arabia, promote a form of conservative reformism and regard Sufi Islam as [...] "heterodox" [...] and contrary to their interpretation of traditional Islam. Such NGOs have built Salafi-dominated mosques and Islamic centers in Africa, and many are staffed by puritanical African Muslims, often trained in the Middle East. Academic scholarships to study in Islamic universities in the Middle East are also offered to further Salafism.|$|R
25|$|Following the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Tatar and Turkish {{were again}} {{added to the}} {{curriculum}} {{for members of the}} respective communities, and, in 1993, the Medgidia madrasah was reopened as a Theological and Pedagogic High School named after Turkish President Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. The school was later elevated to National College status, and is known in Romanian as Colegiul Național Kemal Atatürk. Since the 1990s, the official representatives of the Muslim community maintain close relations with international non-governmental organizations such as the <b>Muslim</b> <b>World</b> <b>League.</b>|$|E
25|$|King Faisal also {{supported}} monarchist and conservative {{movements in the}} Arab world, and sought to counter the influences of socialism and Arab nationalism in the region by promoting pan-Islamism as an alternative. To that end, he called {{for the establishment of}} the <b>Muslim</b> <b>World</b> <b>League,</b> visiting several Muslim countries to advocate the idea. He also engaged in a propaganda and media war with Egypt's pan-Arabist president, Gamal Abdel Nasser, and engaged in a proxy war with Egypt in Yemen that lasted until 1967 (see Yemeni Civil War). Faisal never explicitly repudiated pan-Arabism, however, and continued to call for inter-Arab solidarity in broad terms.|$|E
25|$|A two-day {{event of}} {{international}} symposium addressing contemporary challenges facing Muslim minorities {{was held in}} Taipei on 13–14 April 2015. Organized by <b>Muslim</b> <b>World</b> <b>League,</b> Ministry of Foreign Affairs and several non-governmental organizations, the event was attended by participants from more than 20 countries and territories. Speaking at the opening ceremony, Foreign Affairs Minister David Lin said that the symposium represents a confidence by the world Muslim community in the promotion of religious equality by the government. Lin also added that Taiwan has helped the conflicts happening in parts of Iraq and Syria by aiding more than US$8.25 million in assistance, including 350 prefabricated shelters to refugees.|$|E
5000|$|On September 11, 2006, {{the leaders}} of Muslim {{communities}} in Italy endorsed statements by Pope Benedict XVI who warned that Africa and Asia feel threatened by the West's materialism and secularism. [...] "We agree with the Pope," [...] said Roberto Piccardo, the spokesman of Italy's largest Muslim group UCOII. [...] "It is true that Muslims are puzzled by a West which is hostage to a materialistic system." [...] Mario Scialoja, {{the former president of}} the <b>World</b> <b>Muslim</b> <b>League,</b> also expressed support for the pope's words, saying that the [...] "West's exclusion of God leads to the wrong life models." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{group has}} been called a {{salafist}} organization [...] "that embraces a legalist and scripture centered understanding of Islam". David Commins has described it as the fruit of missionary work by the Saudi Arabian funded and led <b>World</b> <b>Muslim</b> <b>League.</b> [...] "Essential texts" [...] for members of the Izala Society are [...] "Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab's treatise of God's unity and commentaries by his grandsons". Ibn Abd al-Wahhab was the founder of the Wahhabi mission, the official Islamic interpretation of Saudi Arabia. He saw Sufism as rife with idolatry (shirk). The Izala Society has been labeled as infidels by Islamist group Boko Haram, due to their willingness to work with the Nigerian government.|$|R
50|$|Since a United Nations-sponsored ceasefire {{agreement}} in 1991, {{two thirds of}} the territory (including most of the Atlantic coastline - {{the only part of the}} coast outside the berm is the extreme south, including the Ras Nouadhibou peninsula) has been administered by the Moroccan government, with tacit support from France and the United States, and the remainder by the SADR, backed by Algeria. Internationally, countries such as Russia have taken a generally ambiguous and neutral position on each side's claims, and have pressed both parties to agree on a peaceful resolution. Both Morocco and Polisario have sought to boost their claims by accumulating formal recognition, essentially from African, Asian, and Latin American states in the developing world. The Polisario Front has won formal recognition for SADR from 37 states, and was extended membership in the African Union. Morocco has won recognition or support for its position from several African governments and from most of the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world</b> and Arab <b>League.</b> In both instances, recognitions have, over the past two decades, been extended and withdrawn according to changing international trends.|$|R

2500|$|The most {{prominent}} Saudi figures among the donors included Saudi billionaire Saleh Kamel (CEO of Dallah Al-Baraka, accused of funding and supporting al-Qaeda operations), Sulaiman Abdul Aziz Al Rajhi (funder of SAAR Foundation, shut down {{within the framework}} of [...] Operation Green Quest, and CEO of al-Rajhi Bank, investigated several times by U.S. authorities for its role in financing terrorism and al-Qaeda especially), and Ahmad Turki Yamani (son of former Saudi chief of Justice and former Saudi Minister of Petroleum). Saleh Kamel’s case in particular reinforces Saudi Arabia’s role as sponsor of al-Qaeda. For years, Omar al-Bayoumi, an associate of Khalid Almihdhar and Nawaf Alhazmi, two 9/11 highjackers, received a stipend from al-Baraka, the financial group kamel directed. Kamel invested for several years in a Sudanese bank that held accounts under the names of senior al-Qaeda affiliates. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Jidda-based al-Baraka Bank, one of the biggest subsidiaries of the financial group, was also suspected of providing banking services to al-Qaeda operatives. In general, the documents seized during the 2002 Bosnia raid pointed out that al-Qaeda widely exploited charities to channel financial and material support to its operatives across the globe. This was the case, for instance, with the International Islamic Relief Organization (IIRO) and the <b>Muslim</b> <b>World</b> <b>League</b> (MWL). The former had solid ties with al-Qaeda associates worldwide, including al-Qaeda’s deputy Ayman al Zawahiri’s brother working for IIRO in Albania who had actively recruited on behalf of al-Qaeda and involved several Egyptian Islamic Jihad members in IIRO activities. The latter was openly identified by al-Qaeda’s leader as one of the three charities al-Qaeda primarily relied upon for funding sources.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Aggregate data {{analysis}} of elections held between 1990 and 2002 in the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world</b> {{show that most}} of these elections belong to the non-democratic category and these elections were mostly non-competitive. Approximately, 98 % of the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world</b> people do not enjoy full political liberty. About 96 % {{of the people in the}} <b>Muslim</b> <b>world</b> enjoy the right to vote, but their votes hardly result in transfer of power. However, there are four countries in the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world,</b> Bangladesh, Iran, Malaysia and Mali, where elections are relatively free and fair...|$|R
5000|$|A major {{current in}} {{regional}} politics {{at that time}} was secular nationalism, which, with Gamal Abdul Nasser, was sweeping the Arab world. To combat it, Wahhabi missionary outreach worked closely with Saudi foreign policy initiatives. In May 1962, a conference in Mecca organized by Saudis discussed ways to combat secularism and socialism. In its wake, the <b>World</b> <b>Muslim</b> <b>League</b> was established. To propagate Islam and [...] "repel inimical trends and dogmas", the League opened branch offices around the globe. It developed closer association between Wahhabis and leading Salafis, and made common cause with the Islamic revivalist Muslim Brotherhood, Ahl-i Hadith and the Jamaat-i Islami, combating Sufism and [...] "innovative" [...] popular religious practices and rejecting the West and Western [...] "ways which were so deleterious of Muslim piety and values." [...] Missionaries were sent to West Africa, where the League funded schools, distributed religious literature, and gave scholarships to attend Saudi religious universities. One result was the Izala Society which fought Sufism in Nigeria, Chad, Niger, and Cameroon.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to reveal}} the Western construction of Islam and the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world</b> {{as well as to}} analyze the effect of the construction toward the people in the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world</b> reflected in Ignatius’ Body of Lies. The theory of Orientalism by Edward W. Said is used to answer the objectives. The research was qualitative. Descriptive qualitative method was used to analyze the data. The main source of this research was a novel entitled Body of Lies by David Ignatius. The data were discourses consisting phrases, clauses or sentences related to the Western construction of Islam and the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world</b> as well as its effect toward the people of the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world</b> found in the novel. The data analysis was conducted through six steps: identifying, reading and re-reading, coding and categorizing, sorting the data, making the interrelation between the description of the data and the theory, and making an interpretation of the findings. To obtain trustworthiness, the researcher used intra-rater technique and peer debriefing method. The findings of this research show that in order to hegemonize Islam and the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world,</b> the West builds a construction of Islam and the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world</b> which are corrupt, backward, uncivilized and exotic. First, the West uses the corrupt construction to make the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world</b> viewed as naturally and specially corrupt and despotic. Second, the West depicts the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world</b> with its backward condition to emphasize its decline—having fallen behind—superseded by the Christian Western civilization. Third, Islam and the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world</b> are set up as having three characteristics which are unfit with the civilized world condition: having poor and dirty inhabitants, having savage and barbaric characteristic—pamphleteered in terrorism image, and having irrational characteristic. The construction works to describe the inferiority of the <b>Muslim</b> <b>World</b> and to stress the superiority of the Christian Western world. It gives logic to normalize and justify the Christian Western world’s authority, control, and correction over the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world.</b> The construction imposes the people of the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world</b> to be acceptable according to the Western standards of civilization. It makes them become hypocritical. The hypocrisy committed by them can be divided into three categories including concealing Islamic identity and forgetting the history of Islamic civilization, loving Western stuffs, and betraying their countries for preferring much involvement in the War on Terrorism but ignoring neocolonialism happening in their countries...|$|R
