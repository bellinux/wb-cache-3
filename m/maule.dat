5|$|The {{landscape}} around Laguna del <b>Maule</b> {{is mostly}} desertic without trees. Vegetation around Laguna del <b>Maule</b> is principally formed by cushion plants and sub-shrubs, with higher altitudes displaying more scattered vegetation. The rocks around Laguna del <b>Maule</b> host a plant named Leucheria graui {{which has not}} been found elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Laguna del <b>Maule</b> is a {{volcanic}} {{field in the}} Andes mountain range of Chile, close to, and partly overlapping, the Chile-Argentina frontier. The bulk of the volcanic field is in the Talca province of Chile's <b>Maule</b> Region. It is {{a segment of the}} Southern Volcanic Zone, part of the Andean Volcanic Belt. Many of the volcanic centres in the Laguna del <b>Maule</b> volcanic field formed during postglacial times, after glaciers had retreated from the area. This activity has generated cones, lava domes, lava coulees and lava flows which surround Laguna del <b>Maule</b> lake. The field gets its name from the lake which is also the source of the <b>Maule</b> river. Some of the volcanic centres were active during and before the last glaciation; at least three caldera formation events are associated with the system.|$|E

5|$|This {{area of the}} Andes {{was subject}} to {{glaciation}} in the past, which has left traces especially in adjacent valleys. These valleys are U-shaped or have {{the form of a}} trench, shapes associated with glacial action. The older volcanics of Laguna del <b>Maule</b> have been disproportionately eroded by glacial action. Slopes around Laguna del <b>Maule</b> are covered by colluvium including talus slopes.|$|E
5|$|Calabozos lies {{in central}} Chile's <b>Maule</b> Region, near Curicó and Talca, {{on the western}} Andes. This {{is an area of}} poorly glaciated {{mountains}} that is not permanently populated. There are no roads, and it is only accessible via horse or on foot.|$|E

5|$|Pichilemu was {{inhabited}} by Promaucaes, a pre-Columbian tribal group, until the Spanish conquest of Chile.

5|$|The Camus Cross, {{otherwise}} known as the Camuston or Camustane Cross, is an Early Medieval Scottish standing stone located on the Panmure Estate near Carnoustie in Angus, Scotland. First recorded in the 15th century in a legal document describing the boundaries between Camuston and the barony of Downie, and described in the 17th century by Robert <b>Maule,</b> it is a freestanding cross, rare in Eastern Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Calabozos is a Holocene caldera {{in central}} Chile's <b>Maule</b> Region (7th Region). Part of the Chilean Andes' {{volcanic}} segment, {{it is considered}} {{a member of the}} Southern Volcanic Zone (SVZ), one of the three distinct volcanic belts of South America. This most active section of the Andes runs along central Chile's western edge, and includes more than 70 of Chile's stratovolcanoes and volcanic fields. Calabozos lies in an extremely remote area of poorly glaciated mountains.|$|E

Sixteen of the Civil Air Patrol's fleet of 18 Airvans carry the Airborne Real-time Cueing Hyperspectral Enhanced Reconnaissance (ARCHER) system, which can be used to search for aircraft wreckage based on its spectral signature. Other aircraft types include the Cessna 206 and the <b>Maule</b> MT-235. CAP also has a number of gliders, such as the LET L-23 Super Blaník, the Schleicher ASK 21 and the Schweizer SGS 2-33, used mainly for cadet orientation flights.|$|E
5|$|The 6.9 {{earthquake}} of 11 March 2010 occurred {{two weeks}} after the 27 February event. Chilean seismologists, including Sergio Barrientos from the University of Chile Seismological Service, had suggested that the absence of an aftershock greater than magnitude 6 following the February 27 quake indicated that there remained energy with the potential to be released. Two foreshocks of the 11 March event occurred on 5 March: one reached magnitude 5.7, and the other magnitude 5.2; both were felt between the Valparaíso and <b>Maule</b> regions.|$|E
5|$|The Laguna del <b>Maule</b> lake is not {{the only}} lake in the field. The other lakes are Laguna Cari Launa on the Chilean side in the northeastern sector of the field, and Laguna Fea in the south and Laguna Negra lake both on the Argentine side. The Laguna Sin Salida (so named because it lacks a river running out of it) is in the northeastern sector of the {{volcanic}} field and it formed within a glacial cirque.|$|E

5|$|The volcano {{appears to}} be part of a north-south {{trending}} group of rhyolitic, silicic Quaternary volcanoes (including Puelche Volcanic Field, Laguna del <b>Maule,</b> and Volcán Domuyo) that veers off the north-northeast direction of the rest of the Andes. The directional formation of this belt corresponds to the fold-and-thrust movement of the nearby Malargüe fault, which formed in the Tertiary and remained active until the early Pliocene or late Miocene. This may suggest that Calabozos' activity is more dependent on local processes than subduction of the Nazca Plate.|$|E
5|$|The 15.3 to 7 mya old Campanario Formation forms {{much of the}} {{basement}} in the Laguna del <b>Maule</b> area. This geological formation contains andesitic-dacitic ignimbrites and tuffs with later dacitic dykes that were emplaced 3.6–2.0 mya. This formation is affected by various faults that extend in north-south direction. An older unit, of Jurassic-Cretaceous age, crops out northwest of the volcanic field. Other formations include an Oligocene-Miocene lacustrine formation named Cura-Mallín, and another intermediary formation named Trapa-Trapa. Trapa-Trapa is of volcanic origin and between 19 and 10 million years old. Remnants of Quaternary ignimbrites and Pliocene, early Quaternary volcanic centres, are also found around the field.|$|E
5|$|The castle saw {{its last}} {{military}} event in 1746, when {{a unit of}} government troops, of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, occupied the building, causing further damage. By 1764, the York Buildings Company was bankrupt, and the remaining contents of the castle, including the roofs, were removed and sold to pay the company's creditors. The avenue of beech trees, which linked the castle and the village, was felled, and the property was sold to William <b>Maule,</b> Earl Panmure, nephew of the attainted Earl of Panmure. He died in 1782, and the property passed to his nephew, George Ramsay, 8th Earl of Dalhousie.|$|E

5|$|Attempts {{were then}} made to {{establish}} batteries {{to the west}} and north of the city, but these efforts were hampered by heavy rain, delaying the construction of defensive earthworks which allowed the garrison to maintain a constant fire on the work parties, which suffered consequent casualties. Fire was especially heavy against the siege lines {{to the north of the}} city, which were easily targeted by the French gunners on 12 August. Operations to establish batteries on this front continued for several days even as losses mounted; on 15 August, Lieutenant Colonel George <b>Maule,</b> Braithwaite's chief engineer, was killed by cannon fire while returning from a night inspection of the trenches. On the night of 21 August the main battery, known as the Royal Battery, came under heavy shellfire and was damaged, but repairs were successful and on the morning of 22 August its 24-pounder long guns opened return fire on the city.|$|E
