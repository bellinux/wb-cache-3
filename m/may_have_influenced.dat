5|$|First, he shunned the states' rights viewpoint, {{stressing}} {{instead the}} need for a strong interdependence between the states. Second, he {{called for an end to}} slavery. Third, he emphasized the importance of education. Though they agreed on this last point, Breckinridge's father had ardently opposed emancipation of slaves and favored states' rights. Historian James C. Klotter opines that Louis Marshall and Robert's mother Mary <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>influenced</b> his positions.|$|E
5|$|He {{was then}} sent to Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire from 1913 to 1914; his family's wealth <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>influenced</b> his {{acceptance}} to the elite private school. Even though he was seventeen, he was admitted as a lower middleclassman, {{the equivalent of a}} sophomore. While in New England, Hawks often attended the theaters in nearby Boston. In 1914, Hawks returned to Glendora and graduated from Pasadena High School that year.|$|E
5|$|In Edgbaston, Tolkien {{lived there}} {{in the shadow of}} Perrott's Folly and the Victorian tower of Edgbaston Waterworks, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>{{influence}}d</b> the images of the dark towers within his works. Another strong influence was the romantic medievalist paintings of Edward Burne-Jones and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood; the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery had a large collection of works on public display.|$|E

5|$|In some {{versions}} of the poem, considered older, Lalli's weapon was a sword. The axe was the murder weapon of Saint Olaf, who was very popular in Finland and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>influenced</b> Henry's legend. However, since Lalli is not portrayed {{as a member of}} the upper class, it is unlikely that he possessed an expensive weapon like a sword, and the axe is a more historically likely choice for Henry's murder.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{question the}} poet's sexuality, theorizing that the numerous letters and poems that were dedicated to Susan Gilbert Dickinson indicate a lesbian romance, and speculating {{about how this}} <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>influenced</b> her poetry. Critics such as John Cody, Lillian Faderman, Vivian R. Pollak, Paula Bennett, Judith Farr, Ellen Louise Hart, and Martha Nell Smith have argued that Susan was the central erotic relationship in Dickinson's life.|$|E

5|$|Chosen for the Gentlemen v Players, Fender had {{his first}} success in the fixture, hitting 50 in 40 minutes, the highest score for the Gentlemen in the match; it <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>influenced</b> his {{selection}} for the MCC team to tour Australia. Some sections of the press suggested Fender should captain that team, but Reginald Spooner was initially appointed by the MCC; when he was unavailable, J.W.H.T.Douglas became captain. Fender {{was included in the}} team, and the press regarded his selection as a formality.|$|E
5|$|Others {{expressed}} a broader analysis, framing Lépine's actions {{as the result}} of societal changes that had led to increased poverty, powerlessness, individual isolation, and polarization between men and women. Noting Lépine's interest in violent action films, some suggested that violence in the media and in society <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>influenced</b> his actions. Following a shooting at Dawson College on September 13, 2006, Globe and Mail columnist Jan Wong controversially suggested that Marc Lépine may have felt alienated from Quebec society as he was the child of an immigrant.|$|E

5|$|Rumours {{about his}} father's cowardice during the First Crusade, however, {{continued}} to circulate, {{and a desire}} to avoid the same reputation <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>influenced</b> some of Stephen's rasher military actions. His wife, Matilda, {{played a major role in}} running their vast English estates, which contributed to the couple being the second-richest lay household in the country after the King.

5|$|The competition's viewing {{figures have}} been rising since 2002. In 2007, {{approximately}} 4.1million Swedes—almost 44% of the country's population—watched the final, and between 2.9million and 3.2million viewers watched each of the semifinals. The viewing figures for the 2007 festival are nearly two million short of the highest recorded viewing figures from 1990. Melodifestivalen is given heavy coverage in the Swedish press.

5|$|After {{leaving the}} University of Minnesota, Grant was {{selected}} {{in both the}} NFL and NBA Draft. He was selected {{in the first round}} (fourteenth overall) of the 1950 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles and fourth round (forty-second overall) selection of the Minneapolis Lakers in the 1950 NBA draft. He played thirty-five games during the 1949–50 NBA season and signed with the Lakers for the 1950–51 NBA season. He chose to continue his basketball career with the Lakers because they were local and because he was offered a raise to stay for the season. Grant's close personal friend, Sid Hartman, was the Lakers' general manager, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>influenced</b> his decision to remain with the team. He averaged 2.6 points per game in his two seasons as a reserve with the Lakers and {{was a member of the}} 1950 championship team.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the early}} 16th {{and the late}} 17th centuries, an {{original}} tradition of stone tented roof architecture developed in Russia. It was quite unique and different from the contemporary Renaissance architecture elsewhere in Europe, though some research terms the style 'Russian Gothic' and compares it with the European Gothic architecture of the earlier period. The Italians, with their advanced technology, <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>influenced</b> {{the invention of the}} stone tented roof (the wooden tents were known in Russia and Europe long before). According to one hypothesis, an Italian architect called Petrok Maly may have been an author of the Ascension Church in Kolomenskoye, one of the earliest and most prominent tented roof churches.|$|E
5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of the American Revolution, Martin was serving as an appointed justice on the Commission of Peace for Frederick County. Martin was reappointed as a justice of the peace by Governor Patrick Henry, along with William Booth and Warner Washington, but all three men declined to serve another term. Martin did not swear into the committee because he refused to serve under the new revolutionary regime, initially believing that American independence from Great Britain was a futile effort. The committee had also been actively arresting Loyalists, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>influenced</b> Martin's decision to turn down his reappointment. Martin retreated from performing civil service entirely, and afterward retired to Greenway Court. Prior to his death, Martin became an active Freemason.|$|E
5|$|In 1835, František {{retired to}} {{a farm in}} the {{south-eastern}} region of Bohemia. There being no suitable local school, Smetana {{was sent to the}} gymnasium at Jihlava, where he was homesick and unable to study. He then transferred to the Premonstratensian school at Německý Brod, where he was happier and made good progress. Among the friends he made here was the future Czech revolutionary poet Karel Havlíček, whose departure for Prague in 1838 <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>influenced</b> Smetana's own desire to experience life in the capital. The following year, with František's approval, he enrolled at Prague's Academic Grammar School under Josef Jungmann, a distinguished poet and linguist who was a leading figure in the movement for Czech national revival.|$|E
