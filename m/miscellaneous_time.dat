Likewise, by way of preliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that while in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost completely extinct; the subsequent relics discovered in what are called the Tertiary formations seem the connecting, or at any rate intercepted links, between the antichronical creatures, and those whose remote posterity {{are said to have}} entered the Ark; all the Fossil Whales hitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period, which is the last preceding the superficial formations. And though none of them precisely answer to any known species of the present time, they are yet sufficiently akin to them in general respects, to justify their taking ranks as Cetacean fossils.|$|E

The Universe after Big Bang should be expand with negative acceleration because of a gravitational interaction all of its parts. But the observations demonstrate, that the further objects of the Universe are arranged from us, the the greater red displacement of spectral lines they demonstrate. If to explain this displacement by Doppler effect, is received, the further objects of the Universe are arranged, the they leave from more fast us, that contradicts common sense, since these objects after Big Bang moving on inertia, i. e. in a slowed-up way. 2. The miscellaneous values of a constant in the law Habble, obtained in <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>time</b> and miscellaneous researchers indirectly indicate an inaccuracy of this law. After discovery of quasars this error has become apparent if to compare a figure 1, demonstrating a validity law Habble on relation of red displacement to visible stellar magnitude (proportional spacing interval) for brightest of galaxies of agglomerations and same relation for quasars on a figure 2, where the straight line is copied from a figure 1.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with various investigations relating to time series analysis and forecasting. Particular attention is given to fractional differencing and its applications to long memory time series models. Chapter 1 entitled "Introduction", contains the summary of the basic time series theory required for the work {{carried out in the}} remaining six chapters. In addition to the general theory, the notion of fractional differencing, time reversibility and optimal experimental designs are included as special aspects of the thesis. In Chapter 2, the general class of univariate ARMA models with time dependent coefficients is considered. Existence and uniqueness of a second-order solution to the model is established using certain AR and MA regularity conditions. A simple form of the solution~ the covariance structure and the associated model building problem are considered from the theoretical point of view. The prediction problem is solved using alternative approaches. Some recursive relations to the optimum linear predictors are obtained by the orthogonal projection in Hilbert spaces. Few examples are added in support of the general results derived in this chapter. Chapter 3 considers the multivariate generalization of the results obtained in Chapter 2. The condition for the asymptotic stationary of the associated process is obtained in terms of the spectral radii of the corresponding matrices. It is shown that the recursive relations of the predictors satisfy a matricial equation as in the univariate case. Assuming the predictive distribution to be multivariate normal, a simultaneous confidence interval for the predictors is derived. The family of ARMA models with constant coefficients and nonstationary innovations is considered in Chapter 4. A particular form of the model is considered for further analysis. It is shown that the usual regularity conditions are necessary and sufficient to ensure the existence and uniqueness of second-order solutions. The covariance structure of the associated process is obtained. The prediction problem is solved using the same procedures as in the stationary innovation case. The effect of nonstationarity in noise is shown to be insignificant in the parameter estimation. In Chapter 5 the theoretical autocorrelation function of an ARIMA (0,d,q) process is obtained. An asymptotically unbiased estimator of the sample spectrum is given. The various relations of the predictors are obtained. In particular, the attention is paid to the minimum mean squared error prediction and it is shown that this predictor is not optimal from the theoretical point of view. Finally, a direct basic form of the predictors of ARIMA (0,d,q); d. 1 model is obtained. Fractional differencing and its applications to long memory time series are discussed in Chapter 6. This new class of ARIMA models aroused the interest of many time series since it has numerous applications in several scientific A proof for the stationarity and invertibility conditions ARIMA(p,d,q); d. R is given. Persistence in time series the Hurst phenomenon are examined for some actual situations. For the predictors of ARIMA (p,d,q); are given and it is shown that the minimum mean squared optimum properties when |d| < 1 / 2. Numerical examples are added. In particular the long memory characteristic of some Australian rivers are demonstrated a suitable model is fitted in each case. Chapter 7 addresses itself to some <b>miscellaneous</b> problems in <b>time</b> series analysis. The first section is devoted to the discussion of some functions of ARMA models and generalizes the existing results for the multivariate case. Some contributions to bilinear time series models are considered in Section 7. 2. Various new results regarding BL(p,q,p,s) and BL(p,q,r,l) are given. Section 7. 3 considers the notion of time reversibility of a stochastic process and non Gaussian ARMA models from the theoretical point of view. The last section i. e. Section 7. 4 discusses the optimal experimental design problems of time series regression model, when the coefficients are stochastic. It is shown that under certain conditions the effect of randomness of the coefficients is insignificant in the optimal design problem...|$|R
40|$|Pybinding is a Python {{package for}} {{numerical}} tight-binding calculations in solid state physics. The main features include: 	 	Declarative model construction - The user {{just needs to}} describe what the model should be, but not how to build it. Pybinding {{will take care of}} the numerical details of building the Hamiltonian matrix so users can concentrate on the physics, i. e. the quantum properties of the model. 	 	 	Fast compute - Pybinding's implementation of the kernel polynomial method allows for very fast calculation of various physical properties of tight-binding systems. Exact diagonalization is also available through the use of scipy's eigenvalue solvers. The framework is very flexible and allows the addition of user-defined computation routines. 	 	 	Result analysis and visualization - The package contains utility functions for post-processing the raw result data. The included plotting functions are tailored for tight-binding problems to help visualize the model structure and {{to make sense of the}} results. 	 The code interface is written in Python with the aim to be as user-friendly and flexible as possible. Under the hood, C++ 11 is used to accelerate demanding tasks to deliver high performance with low memory usage. See the documentation for more details: [URL] Changelog for version 0. 9 	Added support for Kwant v 1. 3. x and improved Model. tokwant() exporting of multi-orbital models. Updated requirements 	 	This version includes extensive internal improvements and raises the minimum requirements for installation. Starting with this release, only Python >= 3. 5 is supported. Newer versions of the scientific Python packages are also required: numpy >= 1. 12, scipy >= 0. 19 and matplotlib >= 2. 0. 	 	 	On Linux, the minimum compiler requirements have also been increased to get access to C++ 14 for the core of the library. To compile from source, you'll need GCC >= 5. 0 or clang >= 3. 5. 	 Multi-orbital models 	 	Improved support for models with multiple orbitals, spins and any additional degrees of freedom. These can now be specified simply by inputting a matrix as the onsite or hopping term (instead of a scalar value). For more details, see the "Multi-orbital models" section of the documentation. 	 	 	Lifted all limits on the number of sublattices and hoppings which can be defined in a Lattice object. The previous version was limited to a maximum of 128 onsite and hopping terms per unit cell (but those could be repeated an unlimited number of times to form a complete system). All restrictions are now removed so that the unit cell size is only limited by available memory. In addition, the memory usage of the internal system format has been reduced. 	 	 	Added a 3 -band model of group 6 transition metal dichalcogenides to the Material Repository. The available TMDs include: MoS 2, WS 2, MoSe 2, WSe 2, MoTe 2, WTe 2. These are all monolayers. 	 Composite shapes 	Complicated system geometries can now be created easily by composing multiple simple shapes. This is done using set operations, e. g. unions, intersections, etc. A complete guide for this functionality is available in the "Composite shapes" section of the documentation. Kernel polynomial method 	 	The KPM implementation has been revised and significantly expanded. A guide and several examples are available in the "Kernel polynomial method" section of the documentation (part 9 of the Tutorial). For a complete overview of the available methods and kernels, see the chebyshev section of the API reference. 	 	 	New builtin computation methods include the stochastically-evaluated density of states (DOS) and electrical conductivity (using the Kubo-Bastin approach). 	 	 	The new low-level interface produces KPM expansion moments which allows users to create their own KPM-based computation routines. 	 	 	The performance of various KPM computations has been significantly improved for CPUs with AVX support (~ 1. 5 x speedup on average, but also up to 2 x in some cases with complex numbers). 	 	 	Added a method for calculating spatial LDOS using KPM. See the "Kernel Polynomial Method" tutorial page and the KPM. calc_spatial_ldos API reference. 	 	 	Improved single-threaded performance of KPM. calc_dos by ~ 2 x by switching to a more efficient vectorization method. (Multiple random starter vectors are now computed simultaneously and accelerated using SIMD intrinsics.) 	 	 	Various KPM methods now take advantage of multiple threads. This improves performance depending on the number of cores on the target machine. (However, for large systems performance is limited by RAM bandwidth, not necessarily core count.) 	 	 	LDOS calculations for multiple orbitals also take advantage of the same vectorization and multi-threading improvements. Single-orbital LDOS does not benefit from this but it has received its own modest performance tweaks. 	 	 	Long running KPM calculation now have a progress indicator and estimated completion <b>time.</b> 	 <b>Miscellaneous</b> 	 	Added the pb. save() and pb. load() convenience functions for getting result objects into/out of files. The data is saved in a compressed binary format (Python's builtin pickle format with protocol 4 and gzip). Loaded files can be immediately plotted: result = pb. load("file. pbz") and then result. plot() to see the data. 	 	 	The eigenvalue solvers now have a calc_ldos method for computing the local density of states as a function of energy (in addition to the existing calc_spatial_ldos). 	 	 	Improved plotting of Lattice objects. The view can now be rotated by passing the axis="xz" argument, or any other combination of x, y and z to define the plotting plane. 	 Deprecations and breaking changes 	 	Added Lattice. add_aliases() method. The old Lattice. add_sublattice( [...] ., alias=name) way of creating aliases is deprecated. 	 	 	The greens module has been deprecated. This functionality is now covered by the KPM methods. 	 	 	The internal storage format of the Lattice and System classes has been revised. This shouldn't affect most users who don't need access to the low-level data. 	 General improvements and bug fixes 	 	StructureMap can now be sliced using a shape. E. g. s = pb. rectangle(5, 5); smap 2 = smap[s] which returns a smaller structure map cut down to the given shape. 	 	 	Plotting the structure of large or periodic systems is slightly faster now. 	 	 	Added 2 D periodic supercells to the "Shape and symmetry" section of the tutorial. 	 	 	Added a few more examples to the "Plotting guide" (view rotation, separating sites and hoppings and composing multiple plots). 	 	 	Fixed broken documentation links when using the online search function. 	 	 	Fixed slow Hamiltonian build when hopping generators are used...|$|R
