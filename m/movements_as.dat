The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be a symptom of Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful abnormal movements such as a gesture or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|E
5|$|Conscious {{and planned}} {{colonization}} of the fertile, but underdeveloped region was pioneered in the 1580s and 1590s by the Ruthenian dukes of Volhynia. Of the Poles, only Jan Zamoyski, who penetrated the Bracław area, was economically active {{by the end}} of the 16th century. There and in the Kiev area Polish fortunes also began to develop, often through intermarriage with Ruthenian clans. In 1630, the great Ukrainian latifundia were dominated by Ruthenian families, such as the Ostrogski, Zbaraski and Zasławski. At the outset of the great civil war of 1648, the Polish settlers comprised barely 10% of the middle and petty nobility, for example in the well-researched Bracław Voivodeship and Kiev Voivodeship. The early Cossack rebellions were, therefore, instants of social uprising, rather than national anti-Polish <b>movements.</b> <b>As</b> class warfare they were ruthlessly stamped out by the state, which would sometimes take their leaders to Warsaw for execution.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{interest is}} based on a need for knowledge development related to the substantial gap between <b>movement</b> <b>as</b> a scientific concept and the practice concept of movement in physiotherapy (PT). The aim is to deepen the understanding of <b>movement</b> <b>as</b> a basic concept in PT and thereby expand the understanding of the PT discipline and paradigm. The thesis also aims to expand the understanding of <b>movement</b> <b>as</b> a universal scientific concept. The research questions are: 1) What is the meaning of <b>movement</b> <b>as</b> a basic concept in PT when relating to the ontological meaning, substance, form and essence? 2) What outlines for a scientific theory, with the foundation in the ontological meaning and essence of movement, can be brought forward and used as a basis for development of an internally shaped PT discipline? 3) What is the core and essence of <b>movement</b> <b>as</b> a universal concept? The dissertation is inspired by the tradition of caring, and based on a human science approach. The dissertation is categorized as basic research. The overall approach is hermeneutic and the methodology {{is based on}} Eriksson’s (2010 a; 2012) model for concept determination consisting of ontological and contextual determination. The understanding of movement is deepened and the concept is explored from different perspectives: the semantic, the everyday life, the professional, the history of ideas and PT discipline in a hermeneutic spiral where the contextual characteristics are reflected on the ontological characteristics, and vice versa. The hermeneutic interpretation as a continuous spiral between part and the whole – relating the empirical and theory are central. The results of the dissertation consist of three new horizons of understanding: 1) <b>movement</b> <b>as</b> a basic and core concept in PT, 2) a contextual model of movement in PT and 3) a universal ideal model for natural <b>movement.</b> <b>Movement</b> <b>as</b> value, meaning and emotion, with natural <b>movement</b> <b>as</b> an ethos constitute a basic and core concept for PT as a human science. Natural movement is anchored in the historical core and traditional values of PT. The ontological meaning of movement expands the understanding of the active means and forms of movement in physiotherapy in relation to health, health processes and suffering. Natural <b>movement</b> <b>as</b> an ethos may form a research object within the PT discipline with its basis in the health cure and the ontological meaning of the movement concept. The ideal model constitutes a first outline of natural <b>movement</b> <b>as</b> a basic scientific concept. The natural movement of humans can increase the understanding of movement and the bodily dimension in relation to health and suffering. The models and theses, which are introduced as results of the study, are preliminary and provide a basis for further research. <b>Movement</b> <b>as</b> a basic and core concept enable a systematic further development of the PT discipline as a human science and <b>movement</b> <b>as</b> a universal scientific concept...|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} explanations was offered by René Leibowitz, who in 1948 described the first <b>movement</b> <b>as</b> a theme and two variations, the second <b>movement</b> <b>as</b> a theme with a single variation, and the third <b>movement</b> <b>as</b> five variations of yet another theme. Willi Reich, a member of Arnold Schoenberg's circle, described the work as a sonatina which begins {{with a set of}} variations (first movement) and ends with a sonata form (third movement). Reich claimed his explanation was identical to Webern's and stemmed from the two men's conversations, however, the authenticity of this claim has been questioned.|$|R

5|$|In the 1930s Yeats {{was fascinated}} with the authoritarian, anti-democratic, {{nationalist}} movements of Europe, and he composed several marching songs for the far right Blueshirts, although they were never used. He was a fierce opponent of individualism and political liberalism, and saw the fascist <b>movements</b> <b>as</b> a triumph of public order {{and the needs of}} the national collective over petty individualism. On the other hand, he was also an elitist who abhorred the idea of mob-rule, and saw democracy as a threat to good governance and public order. After the Blueshirt movement began to falter in Ireland, he distanced himself somewhat from his previous views, but maintained a preference for authoritarian and nationalist leadership.|$|E

5|$|The {{belief and}} {{practices}} of the Hanzhong Celestial Masters had a profound legacy upon future Daoist belief. The movement marked a significant change from earlier, philosophical Daoist movements. No longer was Daoism a philosophical pastime for the literate and wealthy; it was now promoted to all classes of society, including the illiterate and the non-Chinese. In addition, the Celestial Masters were the first Daoist group to form an organized priesthood that helped spread their beliefs. Being the first organized religious Daoists, the first Celestial Masters are the ancestors of all subsequent Daoist movements such as the Shangqing and Lingbao <b>movements,</b> <b>as</b> well as the medieval Zhengyi Daoists, who claimed affinity to the first Celestial Masters.|$|E

5|$|Many insects possess very {{sensitive}} and, or specialized organs of perception. Some insects such as bees can perceive ultraviolet wavelengths, or detect polarized light, while the antennae of male moths can detect the pheromones of female moths over distances of many kilometers. The yellow paper wasp (Polistes versicolor) {{is known for}} its wagging <b>movements</b> <b>as</b> a form of communication within the colony; it can waggle with a frequency of 10.6±2.1Hz (n=190). These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest and aggression between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging expeditions. There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae, and vice versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound; while the patterns are not universal, insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it. Different insect species can have varying hearing, though most insects can hear only a narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2kHz, and some grasshoppers can hear up to 50kHz. Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey or hosts, respectively. For instance, some nocturnal moths can perceive the ultrasonic emissions of bats, which helps them avoid predation. Insects that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts.|$|E
