2500|$|He {{constantly}} avoids {{talking to}} his mother (Clare Coulter) who keeps calling him at work. Telling people to tell her {{he is in a}} meeting or on vacation, he {{even went so far as}} to have an intern get the telephone number to the show changed. When asked why he refused to talk to her he replies, [...] "Talk to her? You're missing the point. The point is, this place is too cheap to get me an assistant. If I had an assistant, she could talk to my mother. But because this place is so goddamn cheap, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> no one to talk to." [...] Findlay does, however, have a close relationship with his BMW dealer, often calling him about small problems with his [...] "$40,000 German car." ...|$|E
60|$|C. Last January twelvemonth. My aunt is married, and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> {{taken her}} place at home.|$|E
60|$|LADY WINDERMERE. Yes. If it {{had been}} a girl, I would have called it after <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> the same name as myself, Margaret.|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> in the {{meanwhile}} descended, and we all drew up to the table.|$|R
5000|$|The Eleventh Hour, three episodes, {{including}} the two-parter, “Does <b>My</b> <b>Mother</b> <b>Have</b> to Know?”, {{in the role}} of Aggie Britt (1964) ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> {{something}} to say against you, and I think it right that she should say it in your presence.|$|E
60|$|GERALD. Oh, no; <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> {{been so good}} to me. No {{one ever}} had such a mother as I have had.|$|E
6000|$|... "Since that I have {{suffered}} a great deal," [...] said Lucius. [...] "Of course you know that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> been staying at The Cleeve?" ...|$|E
6000|$|VIVIE. You are wrong: {{you know}} nothing about her. If you knew the {{circumstances}} against which <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> to struggle-- ...|$|R
60|$|My heart quickened its beat. The boy's answer {{reminded}} me of that other little girl whom <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> once seen.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> {{no reason}} to fear the {{operation}} of such a deed, conceived in favour of an attainted man,' said Darsie.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lois," [...] he said, [...] "what <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> advised {{would make}} me very happy. Will you {{remember}} that I wish it? Will you remember that?" ...|$|E
60|$|King. That's much; yet I believe thee. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> the {{judgment}} of the world, And all things move by that; but, my Alphonso, She has a cruel wit.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} it--I did {{not read the}} newspapers. But <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> been dead a long time. I should not have {{answered}} this if I had seen it." ...|$|E
60|$|Then Uncle 'Rasmus {{insisted on}} knowing how <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> {{received}} {{the news that}} we were bent on making a visit to York Town.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{knew the}} risk!' said Arthur, {{in a low}} voice; 'but <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> once been good to him, and he dared {{everything}} for me.' ...|$|R
60|$|Wondering at {{all this}} tale which, after her secret fashion, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> kept from me till that hour, I set the ring upon my finger.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure. Meet you here. I {{just wanted}} to unload on you, Dare. Looks as if <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> hatched it up between Margie and our esteemed countryman, Richard Swann." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The box {{should have}} gone ten days ago. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> nothing to read, and has been waiting all this time for the next part of Middlemarch," [...] said Raymond.|$|E
6000|$|Maimie said aghast, 'I can't believe it. You see, {{when you}} went away your mother had none, but <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> Tony, and surely they are {{satisfied}} when they have one.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>have</b> {{made that}} message up between you, to try me!" [...] he burst out. [...] "Damn all underhand work is what I say!" ...|$|R
60|$|And as he spoke, Rinolfo limped out of {{the room}} to fetch the Captain of Justice, as <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> bidden him; and his lips smiled cruelly.|$|R
6000|$|... "True," [...] she replied. [...] "There's {{not much}} good in {{thinking}} of it now. It was unfortunate, by the way, that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> me called Castalia." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would serve}} him {{with all my}} heart, but I {{do not want to}} stay here. I love the Castle of Montemar better, and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> no one but me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right, Bill. You see {{you ought}} to do it, not only to please your mother, but to please God. That's what <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> told me over and over again." ...|$|E
6000|$|Maimie said aghast, [...] "I can't believe it. You see, {{when you}} went away your mother had none, but <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> Tony, and surely they are {{satisfied}} when they have one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gaining her freedom, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> to gain {{her daily}} bread next. Her family {{refused to take}} her back. She {{attached}} herself to a company of strolling players.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Pooh!’ said <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>‘a</b> man’s roar {{is neither}} here nor there.’ But her verdict {{as a whole}} was, ‘I would rather <b>have</b> been his <b>mother</b> than his wife.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{less the}} family {{interfered}} the better," [...] said Lord Marney; [...] "and for my part, I {{was very much}} alarmed when I heard <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> gone down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, yes,"--Jack owned {{he had the}} document--"and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> {{ordered a}} chair, and was coming to wait on Miss Lyddy," [...] he whispered piteously, as the young men lingered on the steps.|$|E
6000|$|As {{they were}} {{re-entering}} the house, he said: [...] "Don't utter {{a word of}} what I've told you. I'm going to test whether <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> the power to read my mind or not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} much {{surprised}}," [...] he said, [...] "by what <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> now told me,--very much surprised indeed. If Mr Maguire had any claim upon your hand, should you not have told me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A cuckoo clock!" [...] Doris cried. [...] "A real old cuckoo clock like <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> had." [...] She {{turned the}} clock over and over. [...] "Just like <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had,</b> when Pete was still alive." [...] Her eyes sparkled with tears.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I gather {{from your}} words, sir, {{that you have}} {{yourself}} seen hard service,' my father remarked when the board had been cleared and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> retired for the night.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} the chemist was still at a loss. He stood behind the counter with the glass <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> {{returned}} to him in his hand. Then comprehension grew.|$|R
