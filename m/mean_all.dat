25|$|When {{first asked}} to {{distinguish}} between all, some, and one Genie would interpret some to <b>mean</b> <b>all,</b> but by 1975 she reversed this and began mistaking some for one, which Curtiss interpreted {{as a sign of}} progress. This contrasted with her distinction between more and less, which she had demonstrated by at least August 1973, and her understanding of the qualifiers one and all in everyday conversations. When learning relative terms such as large and small or narrow and wide she simultaneously learned both words in the pair, whereas most people acquire either the marked or the negative form first, and never mistakenly used one term in a pair to mean the other. Although she had difficulty with different pairs of relative and relational terms on tests, she showed significantly greater comprehension outside of test settings.|$|E
25|$|During Bracton's {{time the}} common law was {{separate}} from the canon law of the Church. The former had come to <b>mean</b> <b>all</b> that was not exceptional or special. It was distinguished from Church law, as well as peculiar local customs and royal decrees, and represented the general law of the land. There were some legislative acts, such as the Statute of Merton (1236) and the Statute of Marlborough (1267), however the mass of new law introduced {{during the reign of}} Henry III of England, was by novel creative writs and new forms of action invented in the Court of Chancery and sanctioned by {{the common law}} courts. Bracton knew many writs that were unknown to Ranulf de Glanvill. It was generally perceived that {{there had to be a}} limitation on the number of new writs coming out of chancery, or the king would become an uncontrollable law-maker. Chancery was under the control of the Church and ecclesiastic lawyers.|$|E

25|$|The Deccan plateau is a topographically {{variegated}} region located {{south of}} the Gangetic plains-the portion lying between the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal-and includes a substantial area {{to the north of}} the Satpura Range, which has popularly been regarded as the divide between northern India and the Deccan. The name derives from the Sanskrit daksina ("south"). The plateau is bounded on the east and west by the Ghats, while its northern extremity is the Vindhya Range. The Deccan's average elevation is about 2,000 feet (600 m), sloping generally eastward; its principal rivers, the Godavari, Krishna, and Cauvery, flow from the Western Ghats eastward to the Bay of Bengal. The plateau's climate is drier than that on the coasts and is arid in places. Although sometimes used to <b>mean</b> <b>all</b> of India {{south of the}} Narmada River, the word Deccan relates more specifically to that area of rich volcanic soils and lava-covered plateaus in the northern part of the peninsula between the Narmada and Krishna rivers.|$|E
25|$|Within {{one week}} {{from the start}} of Operation Barbarossa, Heydrich issued an order to his Einsatzkommandos for the on-the-spot {{execution}} of all Bolsheviks, interpreted by the SS to <b>mean</b> <b>all</b> Jews. One of the first indiscriminate massacres of men, women, and children in Reichskommissariat Ukraine took the lives of over 4,000 Polish Jews in occupied Łuck on 2–4 July 1941, murdered by Einsatzkommando 4a assisted by the Ukrainian People's Militia. Formed officially on 20 August 1941, the Reichskommissariat Ukraine – stretching from prewar east-central Poland to Crimea – had become operational theatre of the Einsatzgruppe C. Within the Soviet Union proper, between 9 July 1941 and 19 September 1941 the city of Zhytomyr was made Judenfrei in three murder operations conducted by German and Ukrainian police in which 10,000 Jews perished. In the Kamianets-Podilskyi massacre of 26–28 August 1941 some 23,600 Jews were shot in front of open pits (including 14,000–18,000 people expelled from Hungary). After an incident in Bila Tserkva in which 90 small children left behind had to be shot separately, Blobel requested that Jewish mothers hold them in their arms during mass shootings. Long before the conference at Wannsee, 28,000 Jews were shot by SS and Ukrainian military in Vinnytsia on 22 September 1941, followed by the 29 September massacre of 33,771 Jews at Babi Yar. In Dnipropetrovsk, on 13 October 1941 some 10,000–15,000 Jews were shot. In Chernihiv, 10,000 Jews were put to death and only 260 Jews were spared. In mid-October, during the Krivoy-Rog massacre of 4,000–5,000 Soviet Jews the entire Ukrainian auxiliary police force actively participated. In the first days of January 1942 in Kharkiv, 12,000 Jews were murdered, but smaller massacres continued in this period on daily basis in countless other locations. In August 1942 in the presence of only a few German SS men over 5,000 Jews were massacred in Polish Zofjówka by the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police leading to the town's complete sweep from existence.|$|E

500|$|Disney {{has also}} been accused of racism because some of his {{productions}} released between the 1930s and 1950s contain racially insensitive materials. The feature film Song of the South was criticized by contemporary film critics, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and others for its perpetuation of black stereotypes, but Disney later campaigned successfully for an Honorary Academy Award for its star, James Baskett, the first black actor so honored. Gabler argues that [...] "Walt Disney was no racist. He never, either publicly or privately, made disparaging remarks about blacks or asserted white superiority. Like most white Americans of his generation, however, he was racially insensitive." [...] Floyd Norman, the studio's first black animator who worked closely with Disney during the 1950s and 1960s, said, [...] "Not once did I observe {{a hint of the}} racist behavior Walt Disney was often accused of after his death. His treatment of peopleand by this I <b>mean</b> <b>all</b> peoplecan only be called exemplary." ...|$|E
