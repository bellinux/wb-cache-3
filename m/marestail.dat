50|$|Erigeron canadensis (synonym Conyza canadensis) is {{an annual}} plant native {{throughout}} most of North America and Central America. It is also widely naturalized in Eurasia and Australia. Common names include horseweed, Canadian horseweed, Canadian fleabane, coltstail, <b>marestail,</b> and butterweed. It was the first weed to have developed glyphosate resistance, reported in 2001 from Delaware.|$|E

50|$|Plants have {{developed}} resistance to atrazine and to ALS-inhibitors, and more recently, to glyphosate herbicides. <b>Marestail</b> is one weed {{that has developed}} glyphosate resistance. Glyphosate-resistant weeds {{are present in the}} vast majority of soybean, cotton and corn farms in some U.S. states. Weeds that can resist multiple other herbicides are spreading. Few new herbicides are near commercialization, and none with a molecular mode of action for which there is no resistance. Because most herbicides could not kill all weeds, farmers rotated crops and herbicides to stop resistant weeds. During its initial years, glyphosate was not subject to resistance and allowed farmers to reduce the use of rotation.|$|E

Ravenscraig Quarry is now flooded but otherwise unchanged and is known locally as the 'Blue Waters' or 'Blue Hole' because the light shining off the dark vertical faces of the quarry workings once embued the floodwater with a striking blue colour. The site was at one time a popular swimming hole however a drowning incident ended that and although rich in water plants such as the <b>marestail</b> (Hippuris) and pondweeds (Potamogeton the water has lost its blue colour and serves as an unofficial wildlife preserve. No rails or sleepers remain at the site.|$|E
40|$|Horseweed {{is one of}} many winter annuals {{that has}} {{increased}} across Iowa with the adoption of no-till and a string of mild winters. Horseweed (Conyza canadensis) {{is a member of the}} Composite (sunflower) family and is also referred to as <b>marestail.</b> Recently, horseweed has gained considerable notoriety as being the first weed to develop resistance to glyphosate in Roundup Ready® cropping systems, and glyphosate resistance has been reported throughout the eastern United States...|$|E
40|$|The unusually {{warm weather}} may create {{additional}} weed challenges this spring. Winter annuals in no-till fields will likely accumulate much more biomass prior to planting than normal and therefore use more soil moisture, tie up more nutrients and potentially interfere with planting and crop establishment. In addition, weeds such as horseweed (<b>marestail)</b> will grow more rapidly and reach growth stages {{that are difficult}} to control much sooner than in a “normal” spring...|$|E
40|$|Glyphosate {{resistance}} was first reported in 1996 from rigid ryegrasss in an orchard in Australia. Subsequently, several additional glyphosate-resistant weed populations have been identified: rigid ryegrass in a wheat production system in Australia and in California; Italian ryegrass in Chile; goosegrass in Malaysia; and horseweed (<b>marestail)</b> in the eastern, midwestern, and southeastern United States. The resistance mechanism in goosegrass {{is due to}} an altered target site, whereas the mechanism in the other weeds is under investigation...|$|E
40|$|Winter annuals {{continue}} to increase as tillage is reduced. Field pennycress, shepherdspurse, horseweed (<b>marestail),</b> chickweed, and others may be present in many fields this spring. Generally, winter annuals do not represent {{a major threat to}} corn and soybean production and thus do not require special tactics for control. However, last fall 2 ̆ 7 s extended warm temperatures have allowed these weeds to accumulate more biomass than typical. Some fields, particularly in the southern third of Iowa, may benefit from targeted herbicide applications to control these weeds...|$|E
40|$|Winter {{annual weeds}} have really begun to grow {{with a vengeance}} and the recent wet {{conditions}} have kept most of the field work to a minimum. Given {{that most of the}} corn is already planted, I am hopeful (albeit not confident) that these weeds have been effectively eliminated from the fields. If not, do not delay as they become considerably more difficult to control once they get some growth momentum. In particular, <b>marestail</b> (aka. Horseweed) is extremely tough to manage once it grows beyond the rosette stage. Other winter annuals are also more difficult to manage as they mature...|$|E
40|$|Conyza species (horseweed or <b>marestail</b> and flaxleaf fleabane) {{are rapidly}} infesting orchards, vineyards, roadsides and canal banks {{throughout}} the San Joaquin Valley.

Glyphosate resistance was demonstrated in 2005 in California. Research by University of California Farm Advisors Kurt Hembree and Anil Shrestha demonstrated that it took up to a 4 X rate of glyphosate for some measure of control along some ditch banks where continuous low application rates of glyphosate had been used.

40|$|Land rolling soybean {{has become}} a common {{practice}} {{in some areas of}} northern Iowa. Land rolling pushes rocks and corn root balls down to the soil surface, improving combine harvest operations. However, land rolling field pea, barley, and summer fallow in eastern Montana essentially doubled density of several troublesome broadleaf weeds, including horseweed (also called <b>marestail),</b> kochia, Russian thistle, tumble mustard, prickly lettuce, and redroot pigweed. Iowa has different weed community and environments from Montana, and little is known how, or if, land rolling might influence weed community in Iowa.

40|$|Hippuris vulgaris, {{also known}} as {{horsetail}} or <b>marestail,</b> is a freshwater macrophyte occurring in lakes, rivers, ponds and marshes.

In the present study, we analysed {{for the first time the}} volatile composition of H. vulgaris growing in central Italy. For the purpose, the essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation and analysed by GC-MS. The chemical composition was dominated by aliphatic compounds such as fatty acids (26. 0 %), ketones (18. 7 %) and alkanes (11. 4 %), whereas terpenoids were poorer and mostly represented by diterpenes (7. 4 %). n-Hexadecanoic acid (25. 5 %), hexahydrofarnesyl acetone (17. 5 %) and trans-phytol (7. 4 %) were the major volatile constituents. These compounds are here proposed as chemotaxonomic markers of the species...|$|E

40|$|Drought is {{a common}} {{occurrence}} for South Dakota beef producers. The variation in weed control that ranchers need to manage for is the intensity and duration of the rainfall shortages. The common problem however, {{is what happens when}} grass and forbs become stressed and the changes to the vegetation that occurs. Stresses or disturbances that cause the grasses to slow growth and open up bare areas can include several situations; over grazing, flooding, wild fires, severe hail, growing season freeze, soil disturbances (prairie dogs or pocket gophers), and drought. Weeds are very opportunistic and competitive and will readily invade bare areas of ground that are created by these conditions. Once established weeds will aggressively compete for light, nutrients, moisture and space. This will allow for quick weed establishment and when more favorable conditions occur, weeds will spread to new areas and weed densities will increase. Weeds can be divided into three growth categories; 1. Annuals, 2. Biennials, and 3. Perennials. Within these groups they can further be categorized as cool season or warm season plants or as a broadleaf, grass or sedge plants. The plants we tend to be more concerned with during or following drought are the broadleaf weeds. The broadleaf weeds that cause the biggest problems are those introduced or invasive plants that have gotten a foothold here. In South Dakota the invasive weeds of major emphasis for grasslands include Canada thistle, leafy spurge, hoary cress, the knapweeds, biennial thistles (musk, plumeless, bull and scotch), the toadflaxes, field bindweed, absinth wormwood and common mullein. All of these and others are on South Dakota’s state wide and locally noxious lists. They are considered regulated pests in the state. Another group of plants that can take advantage of drought and become a problem in range settings is some native forbs like the vervains, common sunflower, horseweed or <b>marestail,</b> golden rod family, perennial ragweed and cudweed sagewort. In normal conditions these plants are not considered invasive. They can have good forage value at certain growth stages. This can reduce grazing pressure on desirable grass species recovering form drought...|$|E
