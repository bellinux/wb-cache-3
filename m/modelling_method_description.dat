40|$|Abstract—Temperature and {{pressure}} {{are two main}} parameters of CFBB in the control system. Because of the CFBB possess the characteristics of time-varying, large lag and strong coupling, {{it is difficult to}} set up the arithmetical model and achieve better control effects. According to above difficulties, this paper adopts T-S fuzzy <b>modeling</b> <b>method</b> to <b>description</b> the input-output relationship for the control system based on collected data of system. On this basis, it adopts the PIDNN controller algorithm which has very strong adaptability and the whole system simulation is carried out by using MATLAB. The results of simulation experiment show that the designed model is effective and the control system achieves satisfied control effect.

40|$|A new scenario-based {{object-oriented}} <b>modeling</b> <b>method</b> is proposed. It {{incorporates a}} semi-formal intermediate design notation GILO (Generic Interaction Language for Objects) that provides essential ingredients to represent scenario. GILO, being influenced by algebraic specification techniques, has well-defined syntax and semantics, and the <b>modeling</b> <b>method</b> is more rational than existing scenario-based <b>modeling</b> <b>methods.</b> Further, GILO <b>descriptions</b> {{can be translated}} into modules written in CafeOBJ, an algebraic logic language. CafeOBJ has clear semantics based on hidden order-sorted rewriting logic and descriptions can be executable. In order {{to show how the}} proposed <b>modeling</b> <b>method</b> is applied, a concrete case study on a standard design benchmark problem (the SAKE Warehouse problem) is presented.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{problems which}} arise during performance evaluation of parallel and distributed computer systems using Markov <b>models.</b> <b>Methods</b> for the <b>description</b> {{and analysis of}} Markov models with large state space are studied. Stochastic automata, stochastic process algebras, stochastic Petri nets and queueing models are commonly used <b>model</b> <b>description</b> <b>methods.</b> They are explained {{by means of a}} common example. A comparison of these methods is then given, using a set of relevant criteria. Different approaches to the efficient modelling of large systems are discussed and partially extended. One major part of this work is {{the development of a new}} modelling environment which is characterized by a structured description of the overall model, consisting of communicating submodels. This environment is especially suited for describing systems with replicated components. It contains a reduction algorithm which, under certain circumstances, allows to reduce a model's state space dramatically. This kind of state space reduction can also be used in combination with structured numerical analysis. Therefore, our modelling environment provides two methods for dealing with the state space explosion problem. (orig.)

40|$|The {{relationship}} between a sound and its neural representation in the auditory cortex remains elusive. Simple measures such as the frequency response area or frequency tuning curve provide little insight into {{the function of the}} auditory cortex in complex sound environments. Spectrotemporal receptive field (STRF) models, despite their descriptive potential, perform poorly when used to predict auditory cortical responses, showing that nonlinear features of cortical response functions, which are not captured by STRFs, are functionally important. We introduce a new approach to the description of auditory cortical responses, using multilinear <b>modeling</b> <b>methods.</b> These <b>descriptions</b> simultaneously account for several nonlinearities in the stimulus–response functions of auditory cortical neurons, including adaptation, spectral interactions, and nonlinear sensitivity to sound level. The models reveal multiple inseparabilities in cortical processing of time lag, frequency, and sound level, and suggest functional mechanisms by which auditory cortical neurons are sensitive to stimulus context. By explicitly modeling these contextual influences, the models are able to predict auditory cortical responses more accurately than are STRF models. In addition, they can explain some forms of stimulus dependence in STRFs that were previously poorly understood. Key words: neural coding; stimulus–response function; complex sounds; hearing; spectrotemporal receptive field; auditory corte...|$|R

The <b>modeling</b> <b>method</b> foresees the <b>description</b> of both procedures in the public administrations, and the working context of the civil servants. The approach relies on several model types {{that are used to}} organize and to relate the knowledge needed by civil servants in order to perform their daily activities.

These descriptions intend to provide an easy way for civil servants to retrieve knowledge when they need to learn specific aspects of a procedure, and to make collaboration easier in order to enable the emergence of knowledge related to the procedures themselves. Indeed, the method comes with an infrastructure that allows to automatically set up a wiki-based collaborative platform enabling collaboration and knowledge sharing among the stakeholders involved in the activities of a Public Administration.

Test units are subjected to higher than usual levels of “stress ” and a model is used to estimate life at use conditions.

40|$|Radially {{symmetric}} {{flow and}} solute transport around point {{sources and sinks}} is an important specialized topic of groundwater hydraulics. Analysis of radial flow fields is routinely used to determine heads and flows {{in the vicinity of}} point sources or sinks. Increasingly, studies also consider solute transport, biogeochemical processes, and thermal changes that occur in the vicinity of point sources/sinks. Commonly, the analysis of hydraulic processes involves numerical or (semi-) analytical <b>modeling</b> <b>methods.</b> For the <b>description</b> of solute transport, analytical solutions are only available for the most basic transport phenomena. Solving advanced transport problems numerically is often associated with a significant computational burden. However, where axis-symmetry applies, computational cost can be decreased substantially in comparison with full three-dimensional (3 D) solutions. In this study, we explore several techniques of simulating conservative and reactive transport within radial flow fields using MODFLOW as the flow simulator, based on its widespread use and ability to be coupled with multiple solute and reactive transport codes of different complexity. The selected transport simulators are MT 3 DMS and PHT 3 D. Computational efficiency and accuracy of the approaches are evaluated through comparisons with full 2 D/ 3 D model simulations, analytical solutions, and benchmark problems. We demonstrate that radial transport models are capable of accurately reproducing a wide variety of conservative and reactive transport problems provided that an adequate spatial discretization and advection scheme is selected. For the investigated test problems, the computational load was substantially reduced, with the improvement varying, depending on the complexity of the considered reaction network...|$|R

40|$|Recognition is a {{fundamental}} computer vision problem, in which training samples are used to learn models, that then assign labels to test samples. The utilization of training samples is of vital importance to visual recognition, which can be addressed by increasing the capability of the <b>description</b> <b>methods</b> and the <b>model</b> learning <b>methods.</b> Two visual recognition tasks namely object detection and action recognition and are considered in this thesis. Active learning utilizes selected subsets of the training dataset as training samples. Active learning methods select the most informative training samples in each iteration, and therefore require fewer training samples to attain comparable performance to passive learning methods. In this thesis, an active learning method for object detection that exploits the distribution of training samples is presented. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms a passive learning method and a simple margin active learning method. Weakly supervised learning facilitates learning on training samples with weak labels. In this thesis, a weakly supervised object detection method is proposed to utilize training samples with probabilistic labels. Base detectors are used to create object proposals from training samples with weak labels. Then the object proposals are assigned estimated probabilistic labels. A Generalized Hough Transform based object detector is extended to utilize the object proposals with probabilistic labels as training samples. The proposed method is shown to outperform both a comparison method that assigns strong labels to object proposals, and a weakly supervised deformable part-based <b>models</b> <b>method.</b> The proposed method also attains comparable performance to supervised learning methods.
