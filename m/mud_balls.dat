60|$|It is unaccountable {{where all}} this mischievous, bloodthirsty {{multitude}} came from,--how {{they were born}} into that quietness in such a moment of time! What had they been about heretofore? Were they waiting in readiness for this crisis, and keeping themselves free from other employment till it should come to pass?

There you might see the offscourings of the recently finished war,--old soldiers, rusty, wooden-legged: there, sailors, ripe {{for any kind of}} mischief; there, the drunken population of a neighboring grogshop, staggering helter-skelter to the scene, and tumbling over one another at the Doctor's feet. There came the father of the punished urchin, who had never shown heretofore any care for his street-bred progeny, but who now came pale with rage, armed with a pair of tongs; and with him the mother, flying like a fury, with her cap awry, and clutching a broomstick, {{as if she were a}} witch just alighted. Up they rushed from cellar doors, and dropped down from chamber windows; all rushing upon the Doctor, but overturning and thwarting themselves by their very multitude. For, as good Doctor Grim levelled the first that came within reach of his fist, two or three of the others tumbled over him and lay grovelling at his feet; the Doctor meanwhile having retreated into the angle between two houses. Little Ned, with a valor which did him the more credit inasmuch as it was exercised in spite of a good deal of childish trepidation, as his pale face indicated, brandished his fists by the Doctor's side; and little Elsie did what any woman may,--that is, screeched in Doctor Grim's behalf with full stretch of lungs. Meanwhile the street boys kept up a shower of <b>mud</b> <b>balls,</b> many of which hit the Doctor, while the rest were distributed upon his assailants, heightening their ferocity.|$|E

40|$|This study {{purports to}} reveal {{incipient}} scientific thinking observed in children’s daily plays which bring forth {{their interest in}} things and phenomena, and lead them to pursuing their spontaneous approaches to problems and questions. The author let preschool five-year-old children take part in sandbox play, soap bubble play, playing in the water color and <b>mud</b> <b>ball</b> play. I came to the following conclusion after analyzing children’s utterances and conversations during these plays. (1) I observed a lot of “temporary expression utterances” in sandbox play, soap bubble play, and playing in the water color. They are suitable teaching materials for developing incipient scientific thinking. In <b>mud</b> <b>ball</b> play, children make more utterances for building good friendly relations and cooperation than the utterances which cultivate incipient scientific thinking. The play is appropriate for building children’s social skills. (2) In mud-box play and color-water play, “temporary expression utterances” are often made. These plays are appropriate for cultivating awareness which will make up {{a significant part of}} the basic incipient scientific thinking itself. In <b>mud</b> <b>ball</b> play, on the other hand, “fundamental scientific utterances” often are made.

To {{improve the}} {{solubility}} {{of a kind}} of plant polysaccharide derivative (SJ) in drilling fluid system, it was modified by cationization with GTA as cationic etherifying agent.

The viscosity of cationic SJ (CSJ) drilling fluid system was greatly improved and the temperature had a slight effect on rheological properties below 100 ℃.

And <b>mud</b> <b>ball</b> is compacted by high impact force of rotary cutting machine when cutting hard rock strata, as a consequence, resistance torque increases. When the sum of resistance torque and starting torque is greater than rotation torque, pick can`t rotate, leading to eccentric wear of pick.

40|$|ABSTRACT: To enhance {{solubility}} and {{the performance}} of a plant gum (from south peach tree of China, SP gum) as a drilling fluid additive, we explored the potential of Modified SP (MSP) gum by modifying it with epichlorohydrin.

It was discovered that drilling fluids modified with 0. 5 %wt MSP demonstrated more excellent rheology and lower filtration than that of SP treated drilling fluids, which should be contributed to the good clay inhibition obtained from swelling experiment and high inhibitive to the hydration and swell of the mud supported by <b>mud</b> <b>ball</b> immersing experiments...|$|R

50|$|Viewed as a whole, the Kayenta {{is readily}} {{distinguished}} from the geologic formations above and below it. It is unlike them in composition, color, manner of bedding, and sedimentary history. Obviously the conditions of sedimentation changed in passing from the Wingate Sandstone formation to the Kayenta and from the Kayenta to the Navajo sandstone, but the nature and regional significance of the changes have not been determined. In some measured sections the transition from Wingate to Kayenta is gradual; the material in the basal Kayenta, beds {{seems to have been}} derived from the Wingate immediately below and redeposited with only the discordance characteristic of fluviatile sediments. But in many sections the contact between the two formations is unconformable; the basal Kayenta consists of conglomerate and lenticular sandstone that fills depressions eroded in the underlying beds. In Moqui Canyon near Red Cone Spring nearly 10 ft of Kayenta limestone conglomerate rests in a long meandering valley cut in Wingate. Likewise, the contact between the Kayenta and the Navajo in places seems to be gradational, but generally a thin jumbled mass of sandstone and shales, chunks of shale and limestone, <b>mud</b> <b>balls,</b> and concretions of lime and iron, lies {{at the base of the}} fine-grained, cross bedded Navajo. Mud cracks, a few ripple marks, and incipient drainage channels were observed in the topmost bed of the Kayenta on Red Rock Plateau; and in west Glen Canyon, wide sand-filled cracks appear at the horizon. These features indicate that, in places at least, the Wingate and Kayenta were exposed to erosion before their overlying geologic formations were deposited, are it may be that the range in thickness of the Kayenta thus in part (is) accounted for.|$|E

Water demand in Malaysia has shift to 60 % increase from 9543 MLD in 1995 to 15285 WD in 2010. So, treatment of water is important for human needs and considered as a long term mission for sustainable earth. In the intention to reduce water pollution, treatment for domestic wastewater treatment is done such as biofiltration as one of the alternative. Biofilter is easy to operate, reliable, and a cost-saving system to be implemented.

The purpose of this research is to further harness the potential and capability of biofiltration to be used at site to comply with standards of Environmental Quality Act, 1974. Domestic wastewater is produced from kitchens, bathrooms and laundries in residential homes and from various commercial and industrial sources.

A number of well-rounded <b>mud</b> <b>balls,</b> 2 – 20 cm in diameter, were found lying on the gravel of the Xiaohe gully floor.

Then the {{rheological behaviour}} under simple shear tlow was determined of suspensions of three kinds of artificial <b>muds,</b> namely <b>Ball,</b> China and Westwalder clay. All of these clays are commercially available. It was found that these clays had a shear-thinning viscoplastic behaviour. The intluence of NaCI, salinity 5 promile, on the behaviour was also studied. The measurements showed that the yield stress was maximal for suspensions of Westwalder clay (suspended sediment concentrations =< 200 kgm ^- 3). Ball clay showed the lowest yield stress and the yield stress of China clay was intermediate. Any intluence of the addition of NaCI was not detectable. However, the behaviour ofhighly concentrated suspensions of China clay with concentrations ranging from 300 to 600 kgm^- 3 was clearly affected {{by the addition of}} salt.
