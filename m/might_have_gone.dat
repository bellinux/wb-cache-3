5|$|It is {{not quite}} clear where Gaveston spent his time abroad; the {{conditions}} of his exile banned him from staying {{in any of the}} lands of the English king. This precluded both Aquitaine and Ireland, where he had spent his previous exiles. There is some evidence that he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to France initially, but considering the French king's hostile attitude towards him, he is not likely to have stayed there long. Flanders is a much more likely candidate for Gaveston's third and final exile. This time his absence was even shorter than the second time, lasting no more than two months. Returning around Christmas 1311, he was reunited with the King early in 1312, probably at Knaresborough on 13 January. The reason for his quick return might have been the birth of his child, a daughter named Joan, around this time. On 18 January, Edward declared the judgement against Gaveston unlawful, and restored all lands to him.|$|E
5|$|The Millennium Park {{project has}} been the subject of some {{criticism}} since its inception. In addition to concerns about cost overruns, individuals and organizations have complained that the money spent on the park <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to other worthy causes, citing poverty in Chicago and problems in the city's schools. Although the park's design and architectural elements have won wide praise, there has been some criticism of its aesthetics. Other criticism has revolved around the larger issue of corruption and political favoritism in the city; The New York Times reported in July 2004 that an inflated contract for park cleanup had gone to a company that made large contributions to Mayor Daley's election campaign. The park's only full service restaurant, Park Grill, has been criticized for its connection to numerous friends and associates of the mayor.|$|E
25|$|At {{some point}} during the flight, a fire {{developed}} in the cargo section on the main deck; the fire was probably not extinguished before impact. The 'smoke evacuation' checklist calls for the aircraft to be depressurised, and for two of the cabin doors to be opened. No evidence exists that the checklist was followed, or the doors opened. A crew member <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> into the cargo hold to try to fight the fire. A charred fire extinguisher was later recovered from the wreckage on which investigators found molten metal.|$|E

25|$|The American Independent Party, {{which was}} {{established}} in 1967 by Bill and Eileen Shearer, nominated former Alabama Governor George Wallace – whose pro-segregation policies had been rejected by the mainstream of the Democratic Party – as the party's candidate for president. The impact of the Wallace campaign was substantial, winning the electoral votes of several states in the Deep South. He appeared {{on the ballot in}} all fifty states, but not the District of Columbia. Although he did not come close to winning any states outside the South, Wallace was the most popular 1968 presidential candidate among young men. Wallace also proved to be popular among blue-collar workers in the North and Midwest, and he took many votes which <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to Humphrey.|$|E
25|$|Dumouriez was {{at heart}} a monarchist and King Louis XVI had been {{executed}} on 21 January 1793. He planned {{to lead the}} army to Paris and overthrow the National Convention. He negotiated with the Austrians to cooperate by not invading France while her borders were undefended. On 1 April, when the War Minister Pierre de Ruel, marquis de Beurnonville and the government commissioners arrived at his headquarters in Saint-Amand-les-Eaux to demand answers, Dumouriez arrested them and handed {{them over to the}} Austrians. The plan quickly unravelled when the plotters failed to seize control of the frontier fortresses. In one incident, Louis-Nicolas Davout's volunteer battalion fired on Dumouriez. While the cavalry and some of the regular infantry <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> along with the scheme, the artillery and the volunteers, pro-Revolution to the core, refused to follow their general. On 5 April 1793, Dumouriez defected to the Austrians with Duke Louis of Chartres, Jean-Baptiste Cyrus de Valence and other officers. With the plot in ruins, the Austrians resumed hostilities.|$|E
500|$|Ramming Cumberland nearly {{resulted}} in the sinking of Virginia as well. [...] Virginia's bow ram got stuck in the enemy ship's hull, and as Cumberland listed and began to go down, she almost pulled Virginia under with her. At the time the vessels were locked, one of Cumberland's anchors was hanging directly above the foredeck of Virginia. Had it come loose, the two ships <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> down together. Virginia broke free, however, her ram breaking off as she backed away.|$|E

Rotheram {{remained in}} the service, but was never again employed at sea. Collingwood summed the situation up {{in a letter to}} his sister, stating [...] "Though I think him a stupid man I was in hope he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> on in the ship I put him in, which I believe was the only chance he had of being in a ship".|$|E
500|$|In November 2002, two-term {{incumbent}} David Stover {{announced he}} would not seek re-election. [...] In May 2003, Weisner {{announced he would}} run for election in the February 22, 2005 municipal primary election. Weisner announced his candidacy for mayor almost {{two years before the}} election, in order to solidify his base of support, which <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to other potential candidates if he waited. Eventually, a final field of five contested for the two spots on the ballot for the April 5, 2005 general election, but Weisner had endorsements from eight of the twelve city council members and a huge funding advantage.|$|E
500|$|Bessell further {{maintained}} that in January 1969 Thorpe {{called him to}} a meeting together with Holmes, and that again Thorpe put forward suggestions for eliminating Scott. These were dismissed as impractical or ridiculous by Bessell and Holmes, who nevertheless agreed to give the matter further consideration. They hoped, said Bessell, that if they stalled, Thorpe would see the absurdity of his murder scheme and abandon it. Holmes, who largely confirmed Bessell's account of the meeting, later justified this decision {{on the grounds that}} [...] "if we had simply said no, he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> elsewhere—and that might have led to an even greater disaster." [...] According to Bessell and Holmes, discussions of the plan ended in May 1969, after the surprising news of Scott's wedding that month.|$|E

500|$|On June 23, The Economist {{featured}} {{a story on}} China’s one-child policy, focusing on Feng's forced abortion and how the internet was changing power dynamics in China. [...] "Three years ago, Ms. Feng’s suffering <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> unnoticed... But her relatives uploaded the graphic pictures onto the internet, and soon microblogs had flashed them {{to millions of people}} across the country," [...] writes the article's author. [...] Wang Songlian, a researcher for Chinese Human Rights Defenders, said it was certain that the internet had made discussion of Feng's case possible, but she called the officials' punishments [...] "isolated" [...] and said [...] "government officials are virtually immune in using violence and carrying out the policy by force.

2500|$|In 1968 Ohio State {{defeated}} the number one-ranked Purdue Boilermakers {{and continued to}} an undefeated season including a 50–14 rout of Michigan and a Rose Bowl victory over the USC Trojans {{that resulted in the}} national championship. The Class of 1970 became known as the [...] "super sophomores" [...] in 1968, and <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> on to three consecutive national championships except for what may have been the most bitter loss in Buckeye history. The winning streak reached 22 games as Ohio State traveled to Michigan. The Buckeyes were 17-point favorites but directed by first-year coach Bo Schembechler, Michigan shocked the Buckeyes in a 24–12 upset.|$|E
2500|$|Hans Memling {{purchased}} {{citizenship in}} Bruges in late January 30, which suggests {{he was a}} recent arrival to the city. He probably came from Brussels {{where he had been}} apprenticed to Rogier van der Weyden. In Bruges he established himself as a painter fairly quickly. Although it appears he was absent from the city for Charles the Bold and Margaret of York's extravagant 1468 wedding celebration, art historian James Weale speculates Memling <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to England to execute a bridal portrait, commissioned either by Charles the Bold or his father Philip the Good. [...] According to Weale, Memling's position in Bruges was secured by the Dukes of Burgundy.|$|E

2500|$|Whatever {{the precise}} {{stimulus}} and the exact {{date of the}} migration of the village to its present site, it must have occurred in time to create the medieval field system. Butterworth argues that the most likely date would have been around 1340 {{to coincide with the}} construction of Howgill castle, although he accepts that an earlier date, prompted by raids into England by De Bruys in 1311 would also be possible. He points out that once the Lancasters became Lords of the Manor soon after 1335, they had a direct vested interest in protecting both their tenants and their tenants livestock, so that the laying out of a defensible village and the building of Howgill Castle <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> hand in hand ...|$|E
2500|$|Further, {{according}} to sociologists Christopher Uggen and Jeff Manza, the 2000 election <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to Al Gore if the disenfranchised population of Florida had voted. Florida law disenfranchises convicted felons, requiring individual applications to regain suffrage. In their 2002 American Sociological Review article, Uggen and Manza {{found that the}} released felon vote could have altered the outcome of seven senatorial races between 1978 and 2000, and the 2000 presidential election. Matt Ford noted their study concluded [...] "if the state's 827,000 disenfranchised felons had voted {{at the same rate}} as other Floridians, Democratic candidate Al Gore would have won Florida—and the presidency—by more than 80,000 votes." [...] The effect of Florida's law is such that in 2014 [...] "ore than one in ten Floridians – and nearly one in four African-American Floridians – are shut out of the polls because of felony convictions." ...|$|E

For Steins;Gate, the development team aimed for a rate of [...] "99% science and 1% fantasy"; Shikura called the 1989 film Back to the Future Part II a direct influence on Steins;Gate, citing how it is just believable enough to feel real. For Robotics;Notes, 5pb. cooperated with JAXA, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, to bring further realism to the story. The concept of the phone system used in Steins;Gate was created by Tatsuya Matsuhara at 5pb., who at first wanted the game {{to make use of the}} player's own cell phone, but changed the idea due to concerns that it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> against Japanese privacy laws.|$|E
