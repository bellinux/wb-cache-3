40|$|Three {{size classes}} of human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) <b>mRNAs</b> are produced in infected cells: full-length, intermediate, and small. Here we report that the intermediate-size class of viral <b>mRNAs</b> is heterogeneous, consisting of at least 12 differentially spliced species. This group contains nine bicistronic <b>mRNAs</b> producing Env and Vpu and three <b>mRNAs</b> expressing only the first exon of tat. In the latter <b>mRNAs,</b> Env and Vpu expression is blocked {{by the presence of}} the upstream tat open reading frame. We conclude that internal initiation of translation is not the mechanism for generation of the bicistronic env <b>mRNAs.</b> Translation of HIV- 1 <b>mRNAs</b> is consistent with the scanning mechanism in which Env is produced by leaky scanning from <b>mRNAs</b> that contain env as the second or third reading frame. Env and Vpu proteins are expressed from the same <b>mRNAs</b> and are coordinately regulated by Rev. This arrangement may reflect a requirement for coordinate expression of Vpu and Env...|$|R
40|$|SummaryRegnase- 1 and Roquin are RNA binding {{proteins}} {{essential for}} degradation of inflammation-related <b>mRNAs</b> {{and maintenance of}} immune homeostasis. However, their mechanistic relationship {{has yet to be}} clarified. Here, we show that, although Regnase- 1 and Roquin regulate an overlapping set of <b>mRNAs</b> via a common stem-loop structure, they function in distinct subcellular locations: ribosome/endoplasmic reticulum and processing-body/stress granules, respectively. Moreover, Regnase- 1 specifically cleaves and degrades translationally active <b>mRNAs</b> and requires the helicase activity of UPF 1, similar to the decay mechanisms of nonsense <b>mRNAs.</b> In contrast, Roquin controls translationally inactive <b>mRNAs,</b> independent of UPF 1. Defects in both Regnase- 1 and Roquin lead to large increases in their target <b>mRNAs,</b> although Regnase- 1 tends to control the early phase of inflammation when <b>mRNAs</b> are more actively translated. Our findings reveal that differential regulation of <b>mRNAs</b> by Regnase- 1 and Roquin depends on their translation status and enables elaborate control of inflammation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCytoplasmic {{control of}} the adenylation state of <b>mRNAs</b> is a {{critical}} post-transcriptional process involved in the regulation of <b>mRNAs</b> stability and translational efficiency. The early development of Xenopus laevis {{has been a major}} model for the study of such regulations. We describe here a microarray analysis to identify <b>mRNAs</b> that are regulated by changes in their adenylation state during oogenesis and early development of the diploid frog Xenopus tropicalis. The microarray data were validated using qRT-PCR and direct analysis of the adenylation state of endogenous maternal <b>mRNAs</b> during the period studied. We identified more than 500 <b>mRNAs</b> regulated at the post-transcriptional level among the 3000 <b>mRNAs</b> potentially detected by the microarray. The <b>mRNAs</b> were classified into nine different adenylation behavior categories. The various adenylation profiles observed during oocyte maturation and early development and the analyses of 3 '-untranslated region sequences suggest that previously uncharacterized sequence elements control the adenylation behavior of the newly identified <b>mRNAs.</b> These data should prove useful in identifying <b>mRNAs</b> with important functions during oocyte maturation and early development...|$|R

Almost all eukaryotic mRNAs are polyadenylated, with the exception of animal replication-dependent histone mRNAs. These are the only mRNAs in eukaryotes that lack a poly(A) tail, ending instead in a stem-loop structure followed by a purine-rich sequence, termed histone downstream element, that directs where the RNA is cut so that the 3' end of the histone <b>mRNA</b> is formed.|$|E
5|$|It is not {{understood}} how the activated RISC complex locates complementary mRNAs within the cell.

Argonaute proteins are localized to specific regions in the cytoplasm called P-bodies (also cytoplasmic bodies or GW bodies), which are regions with high rates of <b>mRNA</b> decay; miRNA activity is also clustered in P-bodies. Disruption of P-bodies decreases the efficiency of RNA interference, suggesting that they are a critical site in the RNAi process.|$|E

In eukaryotic cells, once precursor <b>mRNA</b> (pre-mRNA) has been transcribed from DNA, it is processed to mature <b>mRNA.</b> This removes its introns—non-coding sections of the pre-mRNA. The <b>mRNA</b> is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is bound to ribosomes and translated into its corresponding protein form {{with the help of}} tRNA.

40|$|Background: Rapidly growing {{evidence}} suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) {{are involved in a}} wide range of cancer malignant behaviours including radioresistance. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate miRNA expression patterns associated with radioresistance in NPC. Methods: The differential expression profiles of miRNAs and <b>mRNAs</b> associated with NPC radioresistance were constructed. The predicted target <b>mRNAs</b> of miRNAs and their enriched signaling pathways were analyzed via biological informatical algorithms. Finally, partial miRNAs and pathways-correlated target <b>mRNAs</b> were validated in two NPC radioreisitant cell models. Results: 50 known and 9 novel miRNAs with significant difference were identified, and their target <b>mRNAs</b> were narrowed down to 53 nasopharyngeal-/NPC-specific <b>mRNAs.</b> Subsequent KEGG analyses demonstrated that the 53 <b>mRNAs</b> were enriched in 37 signaling pathways. Further qRT-PCR assays confirmed 3 down-regulated miRNAs (miR- 324 - 3 p, miR- 93 - 3 p and miR- 4501), 3 up-regulated miRNAs (miR- 371 a- 5 p, miR- 34 c- 5 p and miR- 1323) and 2 novel miRNAs. Additionally, corresponding alterations of pathways-correlated target <b>mRNAs</b> were observed including 5 up-regulated <b>mRNAs</b> (ICAM 1, WNT 2 B, MYC, HLA-F and TGF-β 1) and 3 down-regulated <b>mRNAs</b> (CDH 1, PTENP 1 and HSP 90 AA 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Messenger RNAs {{present in}} C 127 mouse cells {{transformed}} by bovine papilloma virus type 1 (BPV- 1) were studied by the S 1 nuclease protection technique, Northern blotting, and electron microscopic heteroduplex analysis.

They had a common poly(A) addition site located at co-ordinate 53 and all <b>mRNAs,</b> except the type 3 <b>mRNAs,</b> contained an exon located between co-ordinates 41 and 53. In the type 1 <b>mRNAs</b> this exon was connected to a very short leader sequence located around co-ordinate 31. The type 2 <b>mRNAs</b> contained 220 to 400 -nucleotide long leaders which were located approximately 1. 5 X 10 (3) base-pairs further upstream.

RNA blot analyses demonstrate that under conditions of cytokinin inhibition of auxin-promoted cell elongation the levels of these two auxin-responsive <b>mRNAs</b> is unaltered. Fusicoccin-promoted elongation is not associated with an enhanced expression of these two <b>mRNAs,</b> suggesting that the increased levels of these <b>mRNAs</b> observed during auxin-promoted cell elongation are not simply due to enhanced rates of cell elongation. We have also determined that ethylene plays no apparent role in the regulation of expression of these <b>mRNAs.</b> However, the auxins indole- 3 -acetic acid, 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and α-naphthalene acetic acid all enhance an accumulation of these <b>mRNAs.</b> We conclude that the regulation of these <b>mRNAs</b> is directly dependent on auxin.

Here, we show that the protein translational activities of two dendritically localized <b>mRNAs</b> are spatiotemporally complex but constrained by the translational hotspots {{in which they are}} colocalized. Cotransfection of glutamate receptor 2 (GluR 2) and GluR 4 <b>mRNAs</b> (engineered to encode different fluorescent proteins) into rat hippocampal neurons demonstrates a heterogeneous distribution of translational hotspots for the two <b>mRNAs</b> along dendrites. Stimulation with s- 3, 5 -dihydroxy-phenylglycine modifies the translational dynamics of both of these RNAs in a complex saturable manner. These results suggest that the translational hotspot is a primary structural regulator of the simultaneous yet differential translation of multiple <b>mRNAs</b> in the neuronal dendrite...|$|R
