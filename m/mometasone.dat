25|$|Glucocorticoids {{marketed as}} anti-inflammatories are often topical formulations, such as nasal sprays for {{rhinitis}} or inhalers for asthma. These preparations {{have the advantage}} of only affecting the targeted area, thereby reducing side effects or potential interactions. In this case, the main compounds used are beclometasone, budesonide, fluticasone, <b>mometasone</b> and ciclesonide. In rhinitis, sprays are used. For asthma, glucocorticoids are administered as inhalants with a metered-dose or dry powder inhaler.|$|E
