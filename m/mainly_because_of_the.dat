5|$|Henry le Despenser {{continued}} to be controversial after his fighting career was over, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vigorous methods he used to maintain control over the laity in his diocese and his own cathedral church. He defended the orthodoxy of the church against Lollardy as passionately as he defended his episcopal rights and privileges.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell {{visited the}} University of Florida, Florida State University, the University of Miami, and Michigan State University before he {{committed}} to the University of California, Los Angeles to play football for the Bruins. He chose {{to play on the}} West Coast <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opportunities presented for his career after football.|$|E
5|$|Theobald was {{the patron}} of his {{successor}} Thomas Becket, {{and a number}} of other future bishops and archbishops served as his clerks. During his time as archbishop Theobald augmented the rights of his see, or bishopric. Historians of his time and later were divided on his character and he is often overlooked in the historical record, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fame of his successor.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} consists {{largely of}} salt marsh plants. In June the area colors <b>mainly</b> purple <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea-lavender. In October it is <b>mainly</b> red <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Common glasswort. Sea-buckthorn also grows here.|$|R

5|$|Few Myxogastria {{species are}} found in the tropics and subtropics, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high {{humidity}} which prevents the necessary dehydration of the fruit bodies to permit spore dispersal and promotes infestation by moulds. Other factors are low light levels under the forest canopy which reduces phototaxis, light winds, poor soils, natural enemies and heavy rainfall which can wash away or destroy cells. Species living in soil or deadwood decrease as humidity increases. In a study from Costa Rica, 73% of the total findings were in the relatively dry Tropical Moist Forest, while 18% were in the very moist Tropical Premontane Wet Forests and only 9% in Lower Premontane Rain Forest.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's {{first season}} was successful, as the club {{narrowly}} won the Lancashire League title on goal average, over Blackpool. They {{also won the}} Liverpool District Cup by defeating Everton. The subsequent theft of the league and cup trophies cost the club £130 to replace them. Following their success, Liverpool reapplied to the Football League. This application was successful, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resignations of Accrington and Bootle from the Second Division. Liverpool's original strip had been blue and white chequered shirts and white shorts, {{similar to those of}} their neighbours Everton. From 1894 they changed to red shirts and white shorts.|$|E
5|$|The ARF {{gradually}} acquired significant {{strength and}} sympathy among Russian Armenians. <b>Mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ARF's stance towards the Ottoman Empire, the party enjoyed {{the support of}} the central Russian administration, as tsarist and ARF foreign policy had the same alignment until 1903. On June 12, 1903, the tsarist authorities passed an edict to bring all Armenian Church property under imperial control. This was faced by strong ARF opposition, because the ARF perceived the tsarist edict {{as a threat to the}} Armenian national existence. As a result, the ARF leadership decided to defend Armenian churches by dispatching militiamen who acted as guards and by holding mass demonstrations.|$|E
50|$|It is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few {{original}} {{villages in}} the area to remain untouched by developers, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village sits on non urbanizable land causing planning permissions to be either extremely difficult or impossible to obtain.|$|R

5|$|Although {{there was}} never an {{official}} tour of the album, the band gigged in the UK to promote the album. They played dates in Ireland and Scandinavia, and in late October the band was to embark on their first tour of the United States. It was unsuccessful, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mental breakdown of Barrett. In his capacity as tour manager, Andrew King travelled to New York to begin preparations, but he ran into serious problems. Visas had not arrived, prompting the cancellation of the first six dates. The band finally flew across the Atlantic on 1 November, but work permits were not yet obtained, so they settled into a hotel in Sausalito, California, just north of San Francisco. After a number of cancellations, the first US performance was given 4November at Winterland Ballroom, following Janis Joplin fronting Big Brother and the Holding Company.|$|E
5|$|Animals bolstered morale at the front, {{due to the}} soldiers' {{affection for}} them. Some {{recruitment}} posters from World War I showcased the partnership between horse and man in attempts to gain more recruits. Despite the boost in morale, horses {{could also be a}} health hazard for the soldiers, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> difficulty of maintaining high levels of hygiene around horses, which was especially noted in camps in Egypt. Horse manure was commonplace in the battle and staging areas on several fronts, creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. Manure was supposed to be buried, but fast-moving battle conditions often made this impossible. Sanitation officers were responsible for the burial of horse carcasses, among other duties.|$|E
5|$|Cairano's career covers {{just over}} two decades (circa 1490–1510), a {{relatively}} short period, during which, moreover, the majority of works produced is concentrated in the latter decade. Among these, nearly three-quarters are religious commissions, executed <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greater funding available from such sources and the increased likelihood of their conservation over time. Numerous sculptures also stemmed from private commissions, especially funerary tombs, as well as secular cycles {{such as that of}} the Caesars. In many works, there is an evident, and sometimes overwhelming architectural component that indicates the careful preparations made by Cairano in this field. Cairano was lauded, as for example by the municipality of Chiari where he was explicitly named lapicida architectum et ingeniarum optimum.|$|E
5000|$|Pont-Aven is <b>mainly</b> known <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group <b>of</b> {{artists who}} flocked round Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, {{and who were}} joined in 1888 by Paul Sérusier.

40|$|Prognosis of nonresectable cholangiocarcinoma is not good, and in Bismuth type III and IV tumors {{relief of}} {{jaundice}} is seldom achieved, despite successful endoprosthesis insertion. Additional photodynamic therapy {{seems to be}} a promising new approach to these tumors. First pilot studies show relief <b>of</b> jaundice, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intrahepatic ducts and improvements in quality of life indices. Survival time seems to be long; however, randomized studies are necessary to confirm these results...|$|R
30|$|Reports on arthroscopic ACL {{reconstruction}} in congenital deficiencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{lower limb}} are rare. This might be <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patients do not complain of instability in daily activity. Furthermore, intraarticular ACL reconstruction in <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> a femoral notch is challenging.|$|R
5|$|Monsters University earned $268.5 {{million in}} the United States and Canada and $475.7 million in other countries, for a {{worldwide}} total of $744.2 million. Calculating in all expenses, Deadline.com estimated that the film made a profit of $179.8 million. It is the 56th-highest-grossing film of all time, the 12th-highest-grossing animated film all time, the seventh-highest-grossing 2013 film, and the third-highest-grossing Pixar film. The film earned $136.9 million worldwide on its opening weekend. Disney declined to provide a budget for the film; Entertainment Weekly speculated that it was {{higher than that of}} Brave ($185 million), <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high cost of John Goodman and Billy Crystal reprising their roles. Shockya and EOnline reported the budget to be $200 million—on par with previous Pixar films.|$|E
5|$|The {{video game}} {{industry}} has been booming in Montreal since 1997, coinciding {{with the opening of}} Ubisoft Montreal. Recently, the city has attracted world leading game developers and publishers studios such as EA, Eidos Interactive, BioWare, Artificial Mind and Movement, Strategy First, THQ, Gameloft <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quality of local specialized labor, and tax credits offered to the corporations. Recently, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, a division of Warner Bros., announced that it would open a video game studio. Relatively new to the video game industry, it will be Warner Bros. first studio opened, not purchased, and will develop games for such Warner Bros. franchises as Batman and other games from their DC Comics portfolio. The studio will create 300 jobs.|$|E
5|$|Villages {{were usually}} {{concentrated}} around irrigation reservoirs to enable {{easy access to}} water for agriculture. Houses stood immediately below the reservoir embankment, between {{the water and the}} paddy fields below. This facilitated easy control of the water supply to the fields and also supported maintenance of domestic gardens for fruit and vegetable production. A village typically consisted of a cluster of dwellings, paddy fields, a reservoir, a grazing ground, shift crop reserves and a village forest. In areas of high rainfall, a perennial watercourse often took the place of the reservoir. Inland fishing was widespread during the Anuradhapura Kingdom period because of the numerous reservoirs. Although not entirely absent, sea fishing was not common during this period <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rudimentary nature of transporting sea fish to cities which were located far inland.|$|E

50|$|But, the Kim Dae Jung {{administration}} {{following the}} Kim Young Sam administration listed privatization of public enterprise {{as a high}} priority policy in economic policy agenda to implement <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> outbreak <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economic crisis. The new administration decided to privatize POSCO and by 1998, the South Korean government had reduced its ownership of shares in POSCO to less than 20%, and more than 50% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shares in POSCO were in <b>the</b> hands <b>of</b> foreign investors. In 2000, full privatization of POSCO was completed.|$|R
5|$|According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Penda became king in 626, ruled for 30 years, and was 50 {{years old}} at the time of his accession. That he ruled for 30 years should not be taken as an exact figure, since the same source says he died in 655, which would not {{correspond}} to the year given for the beginning of his reign unless he died in the thirtieth year of his reign. Furthermore, that Penda was truly 50 {{years old at}} the beginning of his reign is generally doubted by historians, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ages of his children. The idea that Penda, at about 80 years of age, would have left behind children who were still young (his son Wulfhere was still just a youth three years after Penda's death, according to Bede) has been widely considered implausible. The possibility has been suggested that the Chronicle actually meant to say that Penda was 50 {{years old at the}} time of his death, and therefore about 20 in 626.|$|E

50|$|The place kick, usually {{associated}} with rugby league, rugby union and gridiron was used in Aussie Rules for many years, particularly for kicking out after a behind had been scored.
