Because DWF files are highly compressed, they are smaller and faster to transmit than design files, without the overhead associated with complex CAD drawings (or the management of external links and dependencies). With DWF functionality, publishers of design data can limit the specific design data and plot styles to only what they want recipients to see and can publish <b>multisheet</b> drawing sets from multiple AutoCAD drawings in a single DWF file.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} phenomena {{associated with the}} oblique hypervelocity impact of spherical projectile on <b>multisheet</b> aluminum structures is described. A model that can be employed {{in the design of}} meteoroid and space debris protection systems for space structures is developed. The model consists of equations that relate crater and perforation damage of a <b>multisheet</b> structure to parameters such as projectile size, impact velocity, and trajectory obliquity. The equations are obtained through a regression analysis of oblique hypervelocity impact test data. This data shows that the response of a <b>multisheet</b> structure to oblique impact is significantly different from its response to normal hypervelocity impact. It was found that obliquely incident projectiles produce ricochet debris that can severely damage panels or instrumentation located on the exterior of a space structure. Obliquity effects of high-speed impact must, therefore, be considered in the design of any structure exposed to the meteoroid and space debris environment...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{titanium}} alloys <b>multisheet</b> packs with predefined complex features were manufactured via superplastic forming (SPF) and investigated via metrology and microscopy analysis {{to determine the}} possible occurrence of diffusion bonding. Four sheets of titanium alloys were welded using resistance seam welding based on a defined pattern to manufacture a composite sheet of four layers. Each composite sheet structure was composed of four sheets: two core sheets of the same titanium alloy material - Ti 64 or Ti 54 M, and two external sheets of similar titanium alloy material - Ti 64 or Ti 6242. The composite sheet structures were inflated via SPF process in pockets where the sheets were not welded to each other to form a complex component. A pressure cycle was determined via {{the analysis of the}} numerical data from finite element simulations and a laboratory optimization method to form each <b>multisheet</b> pack. The maximum elongation due to stretching of sheets by SPF could reach 134 % of initial part pre-forming. The wall thickness of each inflated packs was measured via GOM scanning all features of the formed structures. The thickness reduction imposed by SPF to the component surfaces was found to be up to 59 % at some regions of the packs. Several samples from selected regions of each inflated pack were investigated via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to study whether diffusion bonding occurred between the sheets. The GOM scanning and image analysis demonstrated that during SPF, the <b>multisheet</b> packs underwent a degree of diffusion bonding where the adjacent sheets exhibited thickness reduction under compression forces...|$|E
30|$|Electromagnetic <b>multisheet</b> {{modelling}} is {{a powerful}} tool for large model areas, if they can be approximated by a multilayered heterogeneous conductivity structure of small vertical dimension in comparison with the penetration depth of electromagnetic fields. In this paper, thin sheet technique is applied to the whole Fennoscandian (Baltic) Shield, whose upper mantle conductivity structure is the objective of the long period electromagnetic array experiment BEAR (Baltic Electromagnetic Array Research). Three thin sheets, each of about 120, 000 model cells with the base length of 10 km, describe a-priori crustal inhomogeneities in terms of conductances. The three sheets represent i) upper crust from surface to the depth of 10 km including continental and ocean bottom sediments and seawater, ii) middle crust ranging from 10 km to 30 km and iii) lower crust from 30 km to 60 km. Thus, modelling is taking into account distortions caused by crustal conductivity anomalies. Additionally, distortions due to inhomogeneous external current systems are investigated by introducing an equivalent current system of a polar electrojet model at ionosphere height. Modelling results are illustrated by induced current distribution at different depth levels and by various electromagnetic transfer functions. The latter demonstrate the resolution of crustal conductivity anomalies and their screening effect even at long periods. The predicted behavior of transfer functions in the very complex conductivity structure is compared with the experimental BEAR data, showing qualitatively a first order agreement for most of the sites. Modeled phases for periods of a few thousands of seconds are considerably biased in comparison with experimental data if the background 1 -D model has monotonously decreasing resistivity. However, the bias from phases is removed if a conducting asthenosphere having a resistivity of 20 Ωm is emplaced between the depths of 200 km and 300 km. Thus, <b>multisheet</b> modelling indicates a well conducting upper mantle under the Fennoscandian Shield. All modelling has been performed using a <b>multisheet</b> code by Avdeev, Kuvshinov and Pankratov.|$|E

Within a phenomenological model for the electronic structure of UPt 3 chosen to capture the qualitative features of local density functional calculations and de Haas-van Alphen measurements, we show how Fermi surface anisotropy can favor pairing in certain symmetry classes, and influence the phase diagram of unconventional superconductors.

Considering a Fermi surface (FS) {{consisting of a}} slightly corrugated cylinder and two corrugated planes distributed periodically in the momentum space, the thermoelectric effects are considered under general assumptions {{for the value of}} a magnetic breakdown probability. As a result of an external generalized force, the FS sheets in layered conductors with a <b>multisheet</b> FS appear to be so close that the charge carriers (as a result of magnetic breakdown) can move from one FS sheet to another. In addition, the distribution functions of the charge carriers and the magnetic breakdown oscillations of thermoelectrical field along the normal to the layer, under different values and orientations of the magnetic field, B, are calculated.

40|$|The {{resistance}} of layered conductors with a <b>multisheet</b> Fermi surface (FS), {{in a high}} magnetic field, {{in the immediate vicinity}} of Lifshic's topological transition when the separate FS sheets are drown together by an external action, pressure in part (and eventual change of the FS connectivity) is studied theoretically. Analysis of magnetoresistance near topological transition is illustrated for the case of FS in the shape of lightly corrugated cylinder and two corrugated planes distributed with a repeated period in the pulse space. It yields, that as the FS plane sheets approach sufficiently the cylinder, the charge carriers produce a magnetic breakdown of one FS sheet to another, decreasing a sharp anisotropy of magnetoresistance to the in-plane current. Instead of square increase with a magnetic field, the slower resistance growth remains linear in the field within a broad magnetic-field range. In the intimate vicinity of topological transition, when the energy gap between FS layers is negligibly small, the resistance is saturated. Comment: 8 pages, 1 figur...|$|E

An explicit and stable finite-difference vector beam propagation method has also been developed for efficient numerical simulations of the guided-wave optical devices. A modified Y-branch wavelength multi/demultiplexer (abbreviated as WDM) for $ lambda= 1. 31 $ and 1. 55 $ mu m$ was designed and optimized by the beam propagation method (abbreviated as BPM). The device, made by K$ sp+$ ion-exchange in glass with a sputtered Al$ rm sb 2 O sb 3 $ strip on one branch, can provide high extinction ratios and wide bandwidth. It was successfully fabricated.

Four sheets of titanium alloys were welded using resistance seam welding based on a defined pattern to manufacture a composite sheetstock of four layers. The composite sheet structures were inflated via SPF process using the Advanced Forming Research Centre’s 200 T SPF press in pockets where the sheets were not welded to each other to form a complex component. Each sheetstock was arranged to consist of four sheets: two core sheets from the same material, which create the inner structure of the panel, two skin sheets from the same material, which form the outer structure of the panel. Ti 64 (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) and Ti 54 M (Ti- 5 Al- 4 Cr- 4 Mo- 2 Sn- 2 Zr titanium alloy sheets {{were used for the}} core sheets, whereas Ti 64 and Ti 6242 (Ti- 6 Al- 2 Sn- 4 Zr- 2 Mo) titanium alloy sheets were used for the outer sheets of the packs. I will also discuss the manufacture and assembly of the four-sheet packs, and briefly, explain the manufacturing processes adopted to manufacture the dies used in SPF trials. Furthermore, I will go through the applied methodology to define the SPF pressure-time curves to inflate the packs for two SPF gas feeding pipes at specific forming temperature and strain rate. Several samples from selected regions of each inflated pack were investigated via optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to study whether diffusion bonding occurred between the sheets.
