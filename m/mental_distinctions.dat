40|$|The {{so-called}} 'traditional terms' {{have long}} been seen as problematic and the argument continues about what precisely they might refer to. This article finds that there are essentially two different perspectives such {{that the notion of}} a 'part of speech' represents either a mental or a grammatical distinction. Accordingly, the problem with the traditional terms can be said to have arisen out of a conflation of these two perspectives. If we assume that the 'parts of speech' represent grammatical distinctions then the traditional terms are effectively meaningless, because from a grammatical perspective, the 'parts of speech' are not universal concepts. However, if we assume they represent <b>mental</b> <b>distinctions</b> then they would be best understood as notions that represent aspects of the world-view of people using them...|$|E

Being indeed!--there is no being, but a {{universal}} becoming of individualities, and Plato turned his back on truth when he turned towards his museum of specific ideals." [...] Mr. Wells says, again, [...] "There is no abiding thing in what we know. We change from weaker to stronger lights, and each more powerful light pierces our hitherto opaque foundations and reveals fresh and different opacities below." [...] Now, when Mr. Wells says things like this, I speak with all respect when I say that he does not observe an evident <b>mental</b> <b>distinction.</b> It cannot be true that there is nothing abiding in what we know. For if that were so we should not know it all and should not call it knowledge. Our mental state may be very different from that of somebody else some thousands of years back; but it cannot be entirely different, or else we should not be conscious of a difference. Mr. Wells must surely realize the first and simplest of the paradoxes that sit by the springs of truth. He must surely see that the fact of two things being different implies that they are similar. The hare and the tortoise may differ in the quality of swiftness, but they must agree in the quality of motion. The swiftest hare cannot be swifter than an isosceles triangle or the idea of pinkness. When we say the hare moves faster, we say that the tortoise moves. And when we say of a thing that it moves, we say, without need of other words, that there are things that do not move. And even in the act of saying that things change, we say that there is something unchangeable.|$|R

6000|$|Let me {{take one}} example which may mark out {{the outline of}} the contention. Open the nearest comic paper and let your eye rest lovingly upon a joke about a mother-in-law. Now, the joke, as {{presented}} for the populace, will probably be a simple joke; the old lady will be tall and stout, the hen-pecked husband will be small and cowering. But for all that, a mother-in-law is not a simple idea. She is a very subtle idea. The problem is not that she is big and arrogant; she is frequently little and quite extraordinarily nice. The problem of the mother-in-law is that she is like the twilight: half one thing and half another. Now, this twilight truth, this fine and even tender embarrassment, might be rendered, as it really is, by a poet, only here the poet would have to be some very penetrating and sincere novelist, like George Meredith, or Mr. H. G. Wells, whose [...] "Ann Veronica" [...] I have just been reading with delight. I would trust the fine poets and novelists because they follow the fairy clue given them in Comic Cuts. But suppose the Professor appears, and suppose he says (as he almost certainly will), [...] "A mother-in-law is merely a fellow-citizen. Considerations of sex should not interfere with comradeship. Regard for age should not influence the intellect. A mother-in-law is merely Another Mind. We should free ourselves from these tribal hierarchies and degrees." [...] Now, when the Professor says this (as he always does), I say to him, [...] "Sir, you are coarser than Comic Cuts. You are more vulgar and blundering than the most elephantine music-hall artiste. You are blinder and grosser than the mob. These vulgar knockabouts have, at least, got hold of a social shade and real <b>mental</b> <b>distinction,</b> though they can only express it clumsily. You are so clumsy that you cannot get hold of it at all. If you really cannot see that the bridegroom's mother and the bride have any reason for constraint or diffidence, then you are neither polite nor humane: you have no sympathy in you for the deep and doubtful hearts of human folk."

This <b>distinction</b> can be specified by approaches developed in cognitive neuroscience and the analytical philosophy of mind. On {{the basis of a}} representational theory of mental processes, acategoriality refers to a form of knowledge that presumes fully developed categorial mental representations, yet refers to nonconceptual experiences in mental states beyond categorial states. It relies on a simultaneous experience of potential individual representations and their actual “representational ground”, an undifferentiated precategorial state. This simultaneity is possible if the mental state does not reside in a representation but in between representations. Acategoriality can be formally modeled as an unstable state of a dynamical mental system that is subject to particular stability criteria...|$|R

40|$|This Article is {{the final}} {{installment}} in a three-part project that presents a comprehensive challenge to lingering legal distinctions between physical and mental illness {{in the context of}} health insurance. The first installment in this series narrowly inquired as to whether the postpartum mood disorders should be classified as physical or mental illnesses in a range of health law contexts, including the context of health insurance. The second installment was broader in scope and challenged a number of federal provisions that allow publicly- and privately-funded health care programs and plans to provide mental health insurance benefits that are less comprehensive than their physical counterparts. The second installment also proposed comprehensive federal reforms, including the extension of federal mental health parity law to individuals who do not currently benefit from mental health parity law. This third and final Article undertakes an important correction of state mental health parity law. The first section of this Article examines in detail the mental health parity laws of four states: Idaho, Maryland, Nevada, and Vermont. I categorize these states’ divergent mental health parity laws by their breadth and depth of application, whether they mandate the option or inclusion of mental health and substance use disorder benefits, {{and the extent to which}} parity between physical and mental health benefits is required in all rates, terms, and conditions. The second section of this Article justifies and proposes amendments that would not only conform these and other state laws to minimum federal requirements, but would also expand state mental health parity law to all health plans subject to state insurance regulation, require inclusion of mental health and substance use disorder benefits in such plans, and eliminate artificial “biologically-based” and “severe <b>mental</b> illness” <b>distinctions.</b> The third section of this Article offers a uniform mental health parity law for consideration by state legislatures...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this article}} is to review the studies that have linked low {{cholesterol}} levels with psychiatric symptoms or behavioral disorders in order to clarify which cholesterol fractions may influence psychological well being and <b>mental</b> health. The <b>distinction</b> between "bad" (i. e., pro-atherogenic) and "good" (i. e., anti-atherogenic) cholesterol is crucial to decide if the clinical benefits of low cholesterol levels for cardiovascular health might turn into a risk factor for psychiatric morbidity. Although the data from studies linking low cholesterol to aggression, suicide and self-harm, impulsivity, negative mood, postnatal depression, and cognitive dysfunction are far from unequivocal, the balance of evidence from new randomized controlled trials is reassuring. However, there are some subgroups of vulnerable individuals who, unlike the majority of persons in the general population, are susceptible to the psychological and behavioral adverse outcomes associated with low cholesterol levels. Because in some cases pro-atherogenic lipid and lipoprotein fractions are involved in this vulnerability, reaching the double goal of promoting both cardiovascular and mental health may be problematic for some individuals. A major task of future research is to identify these vulnerable individuals...|$|R
40|$|This Article empirically tests two key questions. First: How {{sensitive}} are {{jurors to}} {{variations in the}} language that delineates the criminal mental state categories? Second: To what extent do jurors assign culpability in the manner assumed by the Model Penal Code (MPC) ? In prior work, we challenged numerous assumptions underlying the MPC mental state architecture, which divides guilty minds into four kinds: purposeful, knowing, reckless, and negligent. Our experiments showed that subjects had profound difficulty categorizing some of the mental states, particularly recklessness, {{in the context of}} scenarios in which hypothetical actors caused harmful results. And, when asked to punish hypothetical actors, subjects punished knowing behavior and reckless behavior indistinguishably. Here, we extend our prior work in two main ways. First, we show that a person 2 ̆ 7 s ability to apply the MPC mental states is susceptible to subtle variations in the language that defines and communicates them. For instance, we demonstrate that using slightly different wording can significantly improve participants 2 ̆ 7 ability to accurately identify the mental state of recklessness (notwithstanding that reckless and knowing mental states remain by far the hardest to classify). Second, we show that even when people can see the <b>mental</b> state <b>distinctions</b> that the MPC draws, they don 2 ̆ 7 t necessarily rank order the mental states-by culpability level-in the order the MPC assumes. These findings raise questions about the normative basis for the knowing/reckless distinction in the MPC 2 ̆ 7 s mental state hierarchy in the context of result elements. Further, because even small changes in phrasing can produce significant differences in juror evaluation, the findings raise genuine concerns about the adequacy of MPC-based culpability instructions in criminal cases. Our results suggest the need for a critical reexamination of the substantial divide between the expectations and assumptions of drafters of criminal codes, on one hand, and empirical reality, on the other...|$|R
40|$|A {{very common}} view of Hume’s {{distinction}} between impressions and ideas {{is that it}} is based on their intrinsic properties; specifically, their force and vivacity. Some interpreters have challenged this,one being David Landy (Landy 2006). He argues that for Hume the difference lies instead in the fact that impressions are not copies of anything, while ideas are copies of impressions. I regard this view as unsatisfactory, not because it is fundamentally mistaken but because (to put it in Humean terms) it “…it discovers not all the truth” (Treatise 1. 3. 7. 4). I will argue that Hume was a functionalist about (some) mental kinds, individuating impressions, ideas, and beliefs (and possibly other mental phenomena) in terms of their causal role in our <b>mental</b> economy. The <b>distinction</b> between impressions and ideas involves the fact that ideas are copies and impressions are not, but also more than that. I will also argue that interpreting Hume as a functionalist enables one to make sense of a passage that is impossible to explain on the force-and-vivacity view, and that it does so more readily than Landy’s view. Furthermore, I think this interpretation makes better sense of Hume’s “missing shade of blue” than Landy’s does...|$|R
40|$|Background: Increasingly, {{researchers}} {{attend to}} {{both positive and}} negative aspects of <b>mental</b> health. Such <b>distinctions</b> call for clarification of whether psychological well-being and ill-being comprise opposite ends of a bipolar continuum, or are best construed as separate, independent dimensions of mental health. Biology can help resolve this query – bipolarity predicts ‘mirrored’ biological correlates (i. e. well-being and ill-being correlate similarly with biomarkers, but show opposite directional signs), whereas independence predicts ‘distinct’ biological correlates (i. e. well-being and ill-being have different biological signatures). Methods: Multiple aspects of psychological well-being (eudaimonic, hedonic) and ill-being (depression, anxiety, anger) were assessed in a sample of aging women (n = 135, mean age = 74) on whom diverse neuroendocrine (salivary cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, DHEA-S) and cardiovascular factors (weight, waist-hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, total/HDL cholesterol, glycosylated hemoglobin) were also measured. Results: Measures of psychological well-being and ill-being were significantly linked with numerous biomarkers, with some associations being more strongly evident for respondents aged 75 +. Outcomes for seven biomarkers supported the distinct hypothesis, while findings for only two biomarkers supported the mirrored hypothesis. Conclusion: This research adds to the growing literature on how psychological well-being and mental maladjustment are instantiated in biology. Population-based inquiries and challenge studies constitute important future directions...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{examine the}} legal {{questions}} raised by the involuntary medical and psychiatric treatment of a patient with psychotic denial of pregnancy. A case is presented, and psychotic denial of pregnancy is defined. Legal cases are reviewed that set precedent for state intervention on behalf of either the pregnant mother or the fetus when the mother refuses care. Included are specific cases that have a bearing {{on the rights of}} pregnant women with co-morbid <b>mental</b> illness. A <b>distinction</b> is made between cases in which the mother is competent versus incompetent to make treatment decisions, and particular attention is paid to California law. The authors conducted systematic Westlaw and LexisNexis searches of relevant case law and legal precedent. Laws that address the rights of pregnant women are complex, and courts have allowed medical interventions against objection in cases of both competent and incompetent mothers. No clear legal precedent was found to guide decision-making in the specific case of a woman with psychotic denial of pregnancy. The principles of substituted judgment and best interest may help guide clinicians in making decisions about the treatment of pregnant patients in the absence of clear legal precedent.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{teaching}} of Norwegian occupation history in lower secondary schools. Two research questions elaborate the main focus areas, {{which are based on}} whether the teaching reflects a mythical and community-forming, or critical analysis discursive approach to the field. This is studied through qualitative interviews with nine teachers in three different parts of Norway. In addition their set textbooks, the curriculum "Kunnskapsløftets" section of Social Studies and Council of Europe recommendations for good history teaching in a democratic Europe, are aspects of examination. The reason for this choice of topic is that it has been pointed out in historical research that historical writing about the occupation period in Norway has long been characterized by a mythical "master narrative" with few nuances. Based on previous research, I made an assumption that occupation history is still conveyed with mythical traits and notions in lower secondary schools, but also that the source-critical aspect is prominent. The purpose of this thesis is to illustrate that historical events are often communicated with mythical aspects that simplify actions taken by people. The aim is to illuminate that such a view of the past is inadequate. I have examined teaching methods through four points: 1) Their attitude and reasons for learning history, 2) Use of various sources, topics and teaching methods, 3) Emphasis on historians power of definition and 4) use of history, sense of community and identity. From this, I have arrived at eight main strategies used when teaching occupation history. Three mythical approaches, three critical and two that combine the mythical and the critical aspects. It turns out that teachers largely choose an approach personalizing the teaching of occupation history, through stories associated with family and local community. Links between past, present and future are also central in their teaching. Nevertheless, the material has a dichotomy in relation to whether the teaching is primarily factual or mainly discussion-based. Evaluating sources is a key critical strategy but source-investigation does not demand the <b>mental</b> <b>distinction</b> between past and history. The link between critical and mythical teaching strategies appears to work on attitudes and values, but is linked, to a limited extent, to work with multicultural understanding in the classroom. In the survey of the textbooks, a new perspective or a new aspect of history was revealed. When two of the textbooks convey neither a mythical nor a critical narrative, I raise the question as to whether history also has a third side, consiting facts and skills?Temaet for masteroppgaven er formidlingen av norsk okkupasjonshistorie i ungdomsskolen. Forskningsspørsmålene utdyper oppgavens fokusområder, som baserer seg på hvorvidt formidlingen reflekterer en mytisk og fellesskapsdannende, eller en kritisk, analyserende og drøftende inngang til okkupasjonshistorien. Dette blir undersøkt gjennom kvalitative intervjuer med ni lærere i tre ulike landsdeler. I tillegg studeres lærebøkene de benytter, læreplanen Kunnskapsløftets samfunnsfagdel, samt Europarådets anbefalinger for god historieundervisning i et demokratisk Europa. Bakgrunnen for oppgaven er at det i historieforskning og i offentlige debatter har vært påpekt at historieskrivingen om okkupasjonstiden i Norge lenge har vært preget av et mytisk «masternarrativ» med få nyanser. Ut fra tidligere forskningsarbeider gjorde jeg meg antakelser om at okkupasjonshistorien fremdeles formidles med mytiske trekk og forestillinger i ungdomsskolen, men også at det kildekritiske aspektet er framtredende. Hensikten med oppgaven er å rette fokus på at historiske hendelser ofte blir formidlet med mytiske aspekter som forenkler aktørers handlingsvalg. Det er et mål å belyse at et slikt syn på fortiden er utilstrekkelig. Jeg har undersøkt lærernes formidling gjennom fire punkter: 1) deres holdning og begrunnelse for historielæring, 2) kildebruk, temaer og undervisningsformer, 3) vektlegging av historieskriverens definisjonsmakt og 4) historiebruk, fellesskap og identitet. Ut fra dette har jeg kommet fram til åtte strategier lærerne tar i bruk i okkupasjonshistorieundervisningen: tre mytiske tilnærminger, tre kritiske og to som knytter sammen det mytiske og det kritiske. Det viser seg at lærerne i stor grad legger opp til en personlig inngang til okkupasjonshistorien, gjennom fortellinger tilknyttet familie og lokalmiljø. Sammenknytning mellom fortid, nåtid og framtid står også fram som sentralt i deres undervisning. Likevel viser materialet en todeling i forhold til om undervisningen først og fremst er faktaorientert eller hovedsakelig drøftingsbasert. Kildekritikk er en sentral, kritisk strategi, men kildegranskingen tar stort sett ikke hensyn til det mentale skillet mellom fortid og historie. Sammenknytningen mellom kritiske og mytiske undervisningsstrategier viser seg i arbeid med holdninger og verdier, men knyttes i liten grad opp til arbeid med flerkulturell forståelse i klasserommet. I undersøkelsen av lærebøkene viste det seg å komme fram et nytt perspektiv, eller en ny side ved historien. Når to av lærebøkene verken formidler et mytisk eller kritisk narrativ, stiller jeg spørsmål til hvorvidt historien også har en tredje side, bestående av fakta og ferdigheter...|$|R
