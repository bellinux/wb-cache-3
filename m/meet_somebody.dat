2500|$|In December 1990, she {{adopted an}} infant daughter, Mary Clementine. In 1994, she adopted a baby boy, Carlos Ronstadt. Ronstadt has never married. Speaking of finding an {{acceptable}} mate, in 1974 she told Peter Knobler in Crawdaddy, [...] "...he's real kind but isn't inspired musically, {{and then you}} <b>meet</b> <b>somebody</b> else that's just so inspired musically that he just takes your breath away, but he's such a moron, such a maniac that you can't get along with him. And then after that it's the problem of finding someone that can stand you!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Perrino's body {{remained}} hidden until December 2003, {{when his}} skeleton was found {{embedded in the}} concrete floor of the construction company. He had been shot multiple times in the head. Richard Cantarella, Frank Ambrosiano, Baldassare Amato, Frank Lino and Robert Cardello were all convicted of the murder. Bonanno crime family don Joseph Massino was not indicted for involvement in Perrino's murder {{because he was in}} prison at the time. At the trial, Perrino's daughter, Nicola Langora, testified that on the night Perrino disappeared, that she ate pizza at their home and watched the movie All Dogs Go To Heaven on television with his granddaughter. [...] "I asked him why he was in a hurry, and he said he had to <b>meet</b> <b>somebody</b> in Brooklyn", Langora testified, [...] "I asked him who he had to meet, and joking around he said, 'What's the matter-are you writing a book?'" [...] That was the last time she saw her father.|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Hetty, {{a little}} too decisively. [...] "Of course! Any way, now I have told you {{we are not going}} to worry about these things to-day, and I drove fast partly because the trail is narrow, and one {{generally}} <b>meets</b> <b>somebody</b> here. Did it ever strike you, Flo, that if there's anyone you know in a country that has a bridge in it, you will, if you cross it often enough, meet him there?" ...|$|R

5000|$|According to Incubus lead vocalist, Brandon Boyd: [...] "Promises, Promises, is a {{story about}} a girl and a guy — go figure — and the girl has built up so much armor around herself with the things that she knows how to do...And so, I used these metaphors in the song of, like, magic, like she's an illusionist, so she creates these illusions around her...And she's gotten so good at it that she <b>meets</b> <b>somebody</b> who {{potentially}} could be someone that could help her break through those illusions and those walls, she can't really recognize that he could be the real thing, or they could be the real thing, so she's asking him for one thing: 'Don't make me any promises." ...|$|R

5000|$|This song {{reflects}} {{the problems of}} discrimination that country music listeners face. In the song, Trace has his guitar and <b>meets</b> <b>somebody</b> on an early morning flight and that person asks him what he does. He says he sings [...] "country music mixed with a little rock and a little blues". The guy says he's never been crazy about that hillbilly stuff. Later, Trace asks the guy to attend a country music concert. He says that he'll {{give it a try}} but doubts it'll [...] "change his opinion" [...] upon telling him he'll be busy. Then, he realizes that night that the songs relate to him as well (e.g. [...] "Songs about me and who I am / Songs about loving and living / And goodhearted women, family, and God").|$|R

6000|$|... "When we got {{nearly to}} the gate, I says: 'We might <b>meet</b> <b>somebody</b> now, Andy. I reckon you better take 'em off, and--' Hey? Why, {{of course it was}} Andy Tucker. That was his scheme; and that's how we got the capital to go into {{business}} together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Miss Schuyler. [...] "You {{have not}} told me your notions yet. Still, this {{is clear to}} both of us, Mr. Clavering expects to <b>meet</b> <b>somebody</b> at the Cedar Bluff, and your father is to bring two or three men with him.

6000|$|Clement began, [...] "I {{beg your}} pardon, Mr. Ross, for taking this liberty, but I {{wanted to know}} you and took the first chance that offered.

6000|$|... "It don't {{affect my}} sleep, and I {{am not going}} to break my heart because Miss Lambert prefers {{somebody}} else," [...] he remarked. Only I wish when I was a young man, madam, I had {{had the good fortune to}} <b>meet</b> with <b>somebody</b> so innocent and good as your daughter.

60|$|At length, after {{mounting}} a long rise, {{they came to}} a palace on a mount, facing the vast, red-walled fortress which seemed to dominate the place, which he afterwards knew as the Alhambra, but separated from it by a valley. This palace was a very great building, set on three sides of a square, and surrounded by gardens, wherein tall cypress-trees pointed to the tender sky. They rode through the gardens and sundry gateways till {{they came to a}} courtyard where servants, with torches in their hands, ran out to <b>meet</b> them. <b>Somebody</b> helped him off his horse, somebody supported him up a flight of marble steps, beneath which a fountain splashed, into a great, cool room with an ornamented roof. Then Peter remembered no more.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. He {{took that}} {{a day or}} so after he fetched you back home. Then in about a week he went a second time. An' he packed some stuff with him. Now he's sneaked off, an' Nels, who was down to the lower trail, saw him <b>meet</b> <b>somebody</b> that looked like Padre Marcos. Wal, I went down to the church, and, sure enough, Padre Marcos is gone. What do you think of that, Miss Majesty?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr Mountchesney came in {{and greeted}} the Bardolfs with some warmth. [...] "How {{delightful}} {{in the country in}} August to <b>meet</b> <b>somebody</b> that you have seen in London in June!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Now, dear Lady Bardolf do tell me something, for you can conceive nothing so triste as we are here. We never get a letter. Joan only corresponds with philosophers and Maud with clergymen; and none of my friends ever write to me." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{first time}} I ever met poor Chung {{was at one}} of Mrs. Bouverie Barton's Thursday evening receptions in Eaton Place. Of course you know Mrs. Bouverie Barton, the cleverest {{literary}} hostess at this moment living in London. Herself a well-known novelist, she collects around her all the people worth knowing, at her delightful At Homes; and whenever you go there you are sure to <b>meet</b> <b>somebody</b> whose acquaintance is a treasure and an acquisition for your whole after life.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Gentlemen, {{my uncle}} walked {{on with his}} thumbs in his {{waistcoat}} pockets, taking {{the middle of the}} street to himself, and singing, now a verse of a love song, and then a verse of a drinking one, and when he was tired of both, whistling melodiously, until he reached the North Bridge, which, at this point, connects the old and new towns of Edinburgh. Here he stopped for a minute, to look at the strange, irregular clusters of lights piled one above the other, and twinkling afar off so high, that they looked like stars, gleaming from the castle walls on the one side and the Calton Hill on the other, as if they illuminated veritable castles in the air; while the old picturesque town slept heavily on, in gloom and darkness below: its palace and chapel of Holyrood, guarded day and night, as a friend of my uncle's used to say, by old Arthur's Seat, towering, surly and dark, like some gruff genius, over the ancient city he has watched so long. I say, gentlemen, my uncle stopped here, for a minute, to look about him; and then, paying a compliment to the weather, which had a little cleared up, though the moon was sinking, walked on again, as royally as before; keeping the middle of the road with great dignity, and looking as if he would very much like to <b>meet</b> with <b>somebody</b> who would dispute possession of it with him. There was nobody at all disposed to contest the point, as it happened; and so, on he went, with his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets, like a lamb.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in the least. When {{you can get}} him to say anything, {{which is}} not often, he talks like a sensible, well-educated man. Keep silence about his {{precious}} errand here, and you would fancy him the gentlest and most temperate of human beings; but touch {{the subject of his}} vagabond of an uncle, and the Monkton madness comes out directly. The other night a lady asked him, jestingly of course, whether he had ever seen his uncle's ghost. He scowled at her like a perfect fiend, and said that he and his uncle would answer her question together some day, if they came from hell to do it. We laughed at his words, but the lady fainted at his looks, and we had a scene of hysterics and hartshorn in consequence. Any other man would have been kicked out of the room for nearly frightening a pretty woman to death in that way; but 'Mad Monkton,' as we have christened him, is a privileged lunatic in Neapolitan society, because he is English, good-looking, and worth thirty thousand a year. He goes out everywhere under the impression that he may <b>meet</b> with <b>somebody</b> who has been let into the secret of the place where the mysterious duel was fought. If you are introduced to him he is sure to ask you whether you know anything about it; but beware of following up the subject after you have answered him, unless {{you want to make sure}} that he is out of his senses. In that case, only talk of his uncle, and the result will rather more than satisfy you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I’ll see {{how things}} go for a bit," [...] said Hartley, slowly. [...] "It’s awkward to write and ask for an invitation. And where do your ideas of fate come in?". [...] "They come in all the time," [...] said the captain, with great seriousness. [...] "Very likely my {{difficulty}} was made on purpose for us {{to think of a}} way of getting you out of yours. Or it might be Joan’s fate to <b>meet</b> <b>somebody</b> in London at her uncle’s and marry him. If she goes we might arrange to go up together, so that I could look after her." ...|$|E
