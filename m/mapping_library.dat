A limitation of this approach is that the choice of patterns is more oriented towards expressiveness than efficiency; meaning that it {{does not take into account}} the computational complexity of checking patterns. For this purpose, we define a set of verification-dedicated, atomic property patterns for qualitative and quantitative real-time requirements.

40|$|Mapping virtual {{processes}} onto physical processos {{is one of}} {{the most}} important issues in parallel computing. The prob-lem of mapping of processes/tasks onto processors is equiva-lent to the graph embedding problem which has been studied extensively. Although many techniques have been proposed for embeddings of two-dimensional grids, hypercubes, etc., there are few efforts on embeddings of three-dimensional grids and tori. Motivated for better support of task mapping for Blue Gene/L supercomputer, in this paper, we present embedding and integration techniques for the embeddings of three-dimensional grids and tori. The topology <b>mapping</b> <b>library</b> that based on such techniques generates high-quality embeddings of two/three-dimensional grids/tori. In addition, the library is used in BG/L MPI library for scalable support of MPI topology functions. With extensive empirical stud-ies on large scale systems against popular benchmarks and real applications, we demonstrate that the library can sig-nificantly improve the communication performance and the scalability of applications. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract As {{the scale}} of {{supercomputers}} grows, so does {{the size of the}} in-terconnect network. Topology-aware task mapping, which maps parallel ap-plication processes onto processors to reduce communication cost, becomes increasingly important. Previous works mainly focus on the task mapping between compute nodes (i. e., inter-node mapping), while ignoring the map-ping within a node (i. e., intra-node mapping). In this paper, we propose a hierarchical task mapping strategy, which performs both inter-node and intra-node mapping. We consider supercomputers with popular fat-tree and torus network topologies, and introduce two mapping algorithms: (1) a generic re-cursive tree mapping algorithm, which can handle both inter-node mapping and intra-node mapping; (2) a recursive bipartitioning mapping algorithm for torus topology, which efficiently partitions the compute nodes according to their coordinates. Moreover, a hierarchical task <b>mapping</b> <b>library</b> is developed. The majority of this work was done when Jingjin and Xuanxing were Ph. D. students a...|$|E

Using a questionnaire persons responsible for selections of maps for all United States college <b>map</b> <b>libraries</b> were surveyed to determine {{the degree to which the}} criteria were considered to be important in the selection process for map acquisition. Of 249 mailed 133 questionnaires were returned. The results show that presumed reliability of the map source was considered most important, followed by scale and date. The criteria of size and map projection were noted as seldom considered. The survey shows that the typical American college <b>map</b> <b>library</b> contains 50, 000 to 100, 000 maps with no special emphasis other than United States maps, and is in charge of a map librarian on a part time basis.
