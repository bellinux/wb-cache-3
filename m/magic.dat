5|$|A 2004 {{article in}} USA Today {{suggested}} that playing <b>Magic</b> might help improve {{the social and}} mental skills {{of some of the}} players. The article interviewed players' parents who believe that the game, similar to sports, teaches children how to more gracefully win and lose. <b>Magic</b> also contains a great amount of strategy and vocabulary that children may not be exposed to on a regular basis. Parents also claimed that playing <b>Magic</b> helped keep their children out of trouble, such as using illegal drugs or joining criminal gangs. On the other hand, the article also briefly mentions that <b>Magic</b> can be highly addictive, leading to parents worried about their children's <b>Magic</b> obsession. In addition, until 2007, some of the better players had opportunities to compete for a small number of scholarships.|$|E

5|$|Although modern fantasy {{may often}} embrace strangeness, the Ice and Fire series is {{generally}} praised {{for what is}} perceived as a sort of medieval realism. Believing that <b>magic</b> should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre, Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on <b>magic</b> and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters. Though the amount of <b>magic</b> has gradually increased throughout the story, the series is still to end with less overt <b>magic</b> than most contemporary fantasies. In Martin's eyes, literary effective <b>magic</b> needs to represent strange and dangerous forces beyond human comprehension, not advanced alien technologies or formulaic spells. As such, the characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but not the magical elements like the Others.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{its heavy}} use and {{practice}} by magicians, {{sleight of hand}} is often confused as a branch of <b>magic,</b> but is in reality a separate genre of entertainment, as many artists practice sleight of hand without the slightest interest in <b>magic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chapter seven {{deals with}} conceptions of {{morality}} and ethics, arguing that whereas High <b>Magic</b> typically envisions a dualistic world view of good versus evil, Wicca adheres to a monistic worldview in which malevolence and benevolence are seen as intrinsic parts of the whole. Disagreeing with Luhrmann's view that morality's place in the occult is to hide the pseudo-scientific nature of <b>magic,</b> Greenwood discusses how <b>magic</b> and witchcraft developed in Europe {{as a part of}} moral discourse. She looks at the internal source of morality in High <b>Magic,</b> explaining concepts such as that of the Qliphoth, before examining the internal source of morality in Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft.|$|E

5|$|Dell Williams, {{founder of}} the first feminist sex toy {{business}} in the United States, Eve's Garden, was inspired to launch her store after using a <b>Magic</b> Wand as a student in Dodson's course in the early 1970s. Williams said the <b>Magic</b> Wand was her favorite sex toy because of its dependability and its power at delivering pleasure to the clitoris. In 1974, Dodson recommended the device in her book Liberating Masturbation. In 1975 in her demonstrations, she replaced the Panasonic Panabrator with the <b>Magic</b> Wand. In 1977, Dodson recommended the device to Dian Hanson, former editor of men's magazines Leg Show and Juggs. Hanson recalled her initial experience after receiving the recommendation from Dodson. Hanson said she was instructed to purchase the <b>Magic</b> Wand but was advised to be cautious regarding its emotional and physical influence because it could have properties which could cause habit-forming dependency. She observed that in comparison to her prior vibrator operated by two D batteries, the <b>Magic</b> Wand was significantly more effective.|$|E

The player can then activate the <b>Magic</b> Stone for some special effect. Activating a Haste Stone, for example, gives the character a short speed boost. In some <b>Magic</b> Stones, the power of the stone increases if more than one of the same stone is picked up by the player. Each stone is represented by a corresponding symbol on the racetrack, while stones marked with question marks represent random <b>Magic</b> Stones, which grant the player either a Haste Stone, Fire Stone, Ice Stone, Thunder Stone, Minimize Stone, Reflect Stone, Doom Stone, or Ultima Stone.|$|E

Unlike physical attacks however, <b>magic</b> attacks cannot be chained.|$|E
5|$|<b>Magic</b> is {{a common}} ability in the game, and several {{character}} classes use it.
