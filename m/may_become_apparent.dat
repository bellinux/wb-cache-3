5|$|Termites with {{colonies in}} close {{proximity}} to houses can extend their galleries underground and make mud tubes to enter homes. The insects keep out of sight and chew their way through structural and decorative timbers, leaving the surface layers intact, as well as through cardboard, plastic and insulation materials. Their presence <b>may</b> <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> when winged insects appear and swarm in the home in spring. Control and extermination is a professional job involving trying to exclude the insects from the building and trying to kill those already present. Soil-applied liquid termiticides provide a chemical barrier that prevents termites from entering buildings, and lethal baits can be used; these are eaten by foraging insects, and carried back to the nest and shared {{with other members of the}} colony, which goes into slow decline.|$|E
25|$|The {{duration}} of apparent action is usually {{considerably less than}} the half-life. With most benzodiazepines, noticeable effects usually wear off within a few hours. Nevertheless, {{as long as the}} drug is present it will exert subtle effects within the body. These effects <b>may</b> <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> during continued use or may appear as withdrawal symptoms when dosage is reduced or the drug is stopped.|$|E
25|$|Acute lung injury (ALI), {{also called}} non-cardiogenic {{pulmonary}} edema, {{is characterized by}} the abrupt onset of significant hypoxemia and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates in the absence of cardiac failure. The core pathology is disruption of the capillary-endothelial interface: this actually refers to two separate barriers – the endothelium and the basement membrane of the alveolus. In the acute phase of ALI, there is increased permeability of this barrier and protein rich fluid leaks out of the capillaries. There are two types of alveolar epithelial cells – Type 1 pneumocytes represent 90% of the cell surface area, and are easily damaged. Type 2 pneumocytes are more resistant to damage, which is important as these cells produce surfactant, transport ions and proliferate and differentiate into Type 1 cells. The damage to the endothelium and the alveolar epithelium results in the creation of an open interface between the lung and the blood, facilitating the spread of micro-organisms from the lung systemically, stoking up a systemic inflammatory response. Moreover, the injury to epithelial cells handicaps the lung’s ability to pump fluid out of airspaces. Fluid filled airspaces, loss of surfactant, microvascular thrombosis and disorganized repair (which leads to fibrosis) reduces resting lung volumes (decreased compliance), increasing ventilation-perfusion mismatch, right to left shunt and the work of breathing. In addition, lymphatic drainage of lung units appears to be curtailed—stunned by the acute injury—which contributes to the build-up of extravascular fluid. Some patients rapidly recover from ALI and have no permanent sequelae. Prolonged inflammation and destruction of pneumocytes leads to fibroblastic proliferation, hyaline membrane formation, tracheal remodeling and lung fibrosis. This fibrosing alveolitis <b>may</b> <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> as early as five days after the initial injury. Subsequent recovery may be characterized by reduced physiologic reserve, and increased susceptibility to further lung injuries. Extensive microvascular thrombosis may lead to pulmonary hypertension, myocardial dysfunction and systemic hypotension.|$|E

500|$|Particle {{colliders}} are a type {{of particle}} accelerator used by physicists as a research tool to understand fundamental aspects of the universe. Their operation involves directed beams of particles accelerated to very high kinetic energy and allowed to collide; [...] analysis of the byproducts of these collisions gives scientists good evidence {{of the structure of}} the subatomic world and the laws of nature governing it. These <b>may</b> <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> only at high energies and for tiny periods of time, and therefore may be hard or impossible to study in other ways.|$|E
500|$|Significant {{cases of}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema {{are easy to}} diagnose because of the characteristic signs of the condition. In some cases, the signs are subtle, making diagnosis more difficult. Medical imaging is used to diagnose the condition or confirm a diagnosis made using clinical signs. On a chest radiograph, subcutaneous emphysema {{may be seen as}} radiolucent striations in the pattern expected from the pectoralis major muscle group. Air in the subcutaneous tissues may interfere with radiography of the chest, potentially obscuring serious conditions such as pneumothorax. It can also reduce the effectiveness of chest ultrasound. [...] On the other hand, since subcutaneous emphysema <b>may</b> <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> in chest X-rays before a pneumothorax does, its presence may be used to infer that of the latter injury. Subcutaneous emphysema can also be seen in CT scans, with the air pockets appearing as dark areas. CT scanning is so sensitive that it commonly makes it possible to find the exact spot from which air is entering the soft tissues. [...] In 1994, M.T. Macklin and C.C. Macklin published further insights into the pathophysiology of [...] spontaneous Macklin's Syndrome occurring from a severe asthmatic attack.|$|E

30|$|Extraintestinal {{complications}} in CD include phlegmon and abscess formation. The {{differentiation between}} these two entities {{has important implications for}} patient management, because abscesses can require surgical or percutaneous drainage. Moreover, with new therapies, especially biological therapy (antibodies to tumor necrosis factor alpha drugs, anti-TNF), the presence of abscesses should be ruled out before starting the treatment, because undetected abscesses <b>may</b> <b>become</b> clinically <b>apparent</b> (with risk of sepsis) only after the closure of the drainage from a fistulous tract.|$|R

30|$|This study {{detected}} few {{significant differences}} in the arthropod community between early and late season prescribed fire treatments. Arthropod community composition and guild structure, however, were strongly influenced by environmental factors altered by fire.

Still, differences between early and late season prescribed burns are likely to remain relatively minor in comparison to the overall effect of fire on the arthropod community.|$|R

50|$|Imaging {{is usually}} not pursued in those with {{uncomplicated}} conductive hearing loss and characteristic clinical findings. Those with only conductive hearing loss are often treated medically or with surgery without imaging.

Therefore, imaging is often performed when the hearing loss is sensorineural or mixed.|$|E
5|$|Although chest {{radiography}} {{is an important}} part of the diagnosis, it is often not sensitive enough to detect the condition early after the injury.
