He tries once again to convince her to work with him, telling her {{that he is not}} evil - just a mediocre <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>came</b> into his position by chance, led to stay by the reverence of the Ozians, and he offers to redeem Elphaba's reputation ("Wonderful").

25|$|After {{consulting}} various Hollywood agents, Deeley found writer-director Michael Cimino, {{represented by}} Stan Kamen at the William Morris Agency.

After Cimino was hired, he was called into a meeting with Garfinkle and Redeker at the EMI office. According to Deeley, Cimino questioned the need for the Russian roulette element of the script, and Redeker made such a passionate case for it that he ended up literally on his knees. Over the course of further meetings, Cimino and Deeley discussed the work needed {{at the front of the}} script, and Cimino believed he could develop the stories of the main characters in the first 20 minutes of film.|$|E

Jean also stated that he was sure reasons the episode both could and would not work as a film would occur to those that viewed the episode and later expanded that there was the fear of the potential film being considered [...] "not canonical" [...] with the TV series and the potential backlash of overcoming it by using a [...] "memory wipe".|$|E

(in which Coward was portrayed by his godson, Daniel Massey), the BBC sitcom Goodnight Sweetheart and a BBC Radio 4 series written by Marcy Kahan in which Coward was dramatised as a detective in Design For Murder (2000), A Bullet at Balmain's (2003) and Death at the Desert Inn (2005), and as a spy in Blithe Spy (2002) and Our Man In Jamaica (2007), with Malcolm Sinclair playing Coward in each. On stage, characters based on Coward have included Beverly Carlton in the 1939 Broadway play The <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> <b>Came</b> to Dinner. A play about the friendship between Coward and Dietrich, called Lunch with Marlene, by Chris Burgess, ran at the New End Theatre in 2008.
