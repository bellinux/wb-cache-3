The main finding is that the AIDS epidemic will contribute to increased economic inequality in these countries because (a) it is disproportionately affecting low-income groups and (b) public and private institutions that could spread the costs of the epidemic (for example, health, life, disability, and social welfare insurance) are relatively limited and do not reach the majority of the populations. The chapter also develops a new approach to <b>measuring</b> <b>AIDS</b> medical care costs that yields estimates of US $ 738 per case in India and US $ 1490 per case in Indonesia. Finally, the chapter discusses the political economy of HIV prevention and speculates that more effective control of the epidemic may result from a system in which the government pays for the medical care costs of AIDS than one in which individuals with AIDS and their families bear most of the costs...|$|E
40|$|According to {{the various}} studies, AIDS affects all facets of people’s {{livelihoods}} through illness and death and the subsequent care for orphaned children. Much of this literature uses rural households affected by HIV/AIDS as {{the unit of analysis}} and do not disaggregate data by hosting orphans, AIDS-related chronic illness and AIDS death. However, the AIDS epidemic has resulted in increased appearance of households headed by widows, elderly and orphans; households with orphaned children; households with chronically ill members; and households that recently suffered an adult death. These households are not a homogenous group but differ in their response capacities. Furthermore, the gender context in which AIDS-related impacts occur is of crucial importance but is often inadequately addressed. Also, many of the AIDS-impact studies are literature reviews or small-scale household studies conducted in a few communities over a short time interval. These studies often yield contradicting results and provide speculative inferences for the general population. Research on AIDS impacts is, in fact, complex and several methodological constraints are encountered when conducting micro-level investigations on AIDS and rural livelihood linkages. It is for these reasons that this research focuses on the gender, methodological, and ethical issues concerning AIDS impacts on rural livelihoods in sub-Saharan Africa. It aims at providing insights in how AIDS leads to vulnerability differentiation and what processes make rural households more or less vulnerable to AIDS impacts. This research also tries to provide insights in the resources female-headed household mobilised over time to respond to AIDS and the factors that enabled them in their response. Furthermore, this research examines the methodological and ethical concerns and implications of conducting micro-level AIDS-impact research. The study combines a literature review on AIDS impacts in sub-Saharan Africa, an analytical review of methodological and ethical aspects of AIDS-impact research based on literature and personal experience, and empirical data collection in the Northern Province, Zambia. For the empirical data collection, the adopted research design sequenced the use of qualitative and quantitative methodologies to complement each other. Furthermore, the research collected 12 case studies of female-headed households, which differ by marital status, age, educational attainment and wealth. This research concludes that vulnerability levels to HIV/AIDS impacts differ substantially and that understanding these differences is important as it exposes the causal conditions for people’s vulnerability and as such has important policy and programme implications. These must be sensitive to differentiation of households and challenge the inequalities that drive AIDS susceptibility and vulnerability. Also, the research concludes that female headship cannot be automatically used as an indicator for AIDS vulnerability as households headed by women are not a unitary category but differ by factors that enable them in their response. In order to develop supportive policies and responsive programming, a more complete and systematic evidence-base on HIV/AIDS, gender and rural livelihood linkages and the underlying causal factors is needed. Given the great variation in research design among impact studies that hinder comparison of empirical findings across countries and at a variety of scales, a common research framework is needed. Such a common research framework should comprise several issues. First, an integrated research design that sequences qualitative and quantitative research methods is required to capture the complexity of AIDS-impact. Second, a set of universal standardised indicators for <b>measuring</b> <b>AIDS</b> impact should be included as well as tools to measure these variables should be developed and standardised. Furthermore, standardised indicators should be developed for defining and identifying AIDS-affected households that make reference to the difference in impact between hosting of orphans, morbidity and mortality due to AIDS. Third, a common research framework for AIDS-impact should adopt the household as the core unit of analysis as this is the immediate context within which the provision of primary needs and care takes place, resources are mobilised to respond to AIDS, and continuing reformation takes place. Fourth, to capture the prolonged effects of AIDS on people’s livelihoods the research framework should call for resources to be combined to generate longitudinal data from cross-sectional studies by revisiting of study sites. Also, careful stratification of the sample and the use of a recall period to construct retrospective data from a single interview are required to offset the limitations inherent to cross-sectional surveys. Fifth, because the impact of AIDS is diverse and dependent {{on a wide range of}} factors, the research framework should include stratification of the sample population according to carefully selected criteria in order to understand the differential impacts of AIDS. Last, the research framework for AIDS impact should include guidelines for actual application of the existing ethical principles of respect for persons, beneficence and justice that were originally developed for biomedical research. In particular, guidelines should be developed for overcoming the ethical dilemmas faced when conducting AIDS-impact research and for determining the extent of ethical responsibility a researcher has in respect to informing respondents about their possible status, selecting AIDS-affected households with the support of key informants, the possibility of creating stigma to selected respondents, assisting respondents with testing and counselling, and dealing with malpractices that are observed as part of a research...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Neural {{encoding}} {{of speech}} {{begins with the}} analysis of the signal as a whole broken down into its sinusoidal components in the cochlea, which has to be conserved up to the higher auditory centers. Some of these components target the dead regions of the cochlea causing little or no excitation. <b>Measuring</b> <b>aided</b> speech-evoked auditory brainstem response elicited by speech stimuli with different spectral maxima can give insight into the brainstem encoding of aided speech with spectral maxima at these dead regions. Objective This research aims to study the impact of dead regions of the cochlea on speech processing at the brainstem level after a long period of hearing aid use. Methods This study comprised 30 ears without dead regions and 46 ears with dead regions at low, mid, or high frequencies. For all ears, we <b>measured</b> the <b>aided</b> speech-evoked auditory brainstem response using speech stimuli of low, mid, and high spectral maxima. Results Aided speech-evoked auditory brainstem response was producible in all subjects. Responses evoked by stimuli with spectral maxima at dead regions had longer latencies and smaller amplitudes when compared with the control group or the responses of other stimuli. Conclusion The presence of cochlear dead regions affects brainstem encoding of speech with spectral maxima perpendicular to these regions. Brainstem neuroplasticity and the extrinsic redundancy of speech can minimize the impact of dead regions in chronic hearing aid users...|$|R

40|$|Debate {{about the}} {{effectiveness}} of foreign aid has intensified in recent years, as budgetary pressures on aid have increased in donor countries. Whatever the merits of opposing arguments, the question is: do conventional <b>measures</b> of <b>aid</b> (such as OECD's Net ODA), which lump together grants and loans, accurately reflect true aid flows? The authors analyze the methodological shortcomings of conventional <b>measures</b> of <b>aid</b> and propose a new approach, which <b>measures</b> official <b>aid</b> flows as the sum of grants and the grant-equivalents of official loans (in a new aggregate they call"Effective Development Assistance,"or EDA). They show how results using this conceptually superior measure may differ significantly from conventional aggregates, providing a quite different view on major aid trends. They implement their approach empirically using data on some 40, 000 official loans from the World Bank's DRS database [...] virtually all of the official loans to 133 developing countries from 1975 to 1995. The numerical results underscore several points: 1) The conventional approach has led to systematic overestimates of the concessionality of official loans. This overestimate has increased significantly since the mid- 1980 s. Conventional methods show a rising trend; the new method shows the opposite. 2) Net ODA increasingly overstates the true aid content of official flows, although the divergence between the two approaches is somewhat muted by the rising relative importance of grants over loans in total official flows.
