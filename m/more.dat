5|$|A {{study of}} {{vigilance}} behaviour of herds revealed that individuals on {{the borders of}} herds tend to be <b>more</b> cautious; vigilance decreases with group size. Group size and distance from roads and bushes {{were found to have}} major influence on vigilance, <b>more</b> among the grazing springbok than among their browsing counterparts. Adults were found to be <b>more</b> vigilant than juveniles, and males <b>more</b> vigilant than females. Springbok passing through bushes tend to be <b>more</b> vulnerable to predator attacks as they can not be easily alerted, and predators usually conceal themselves in bushes. Another study calculated that the time spent in vigilance by springbok on the edges of herds is roughly double that spent by those in the centre and the open. Springbok were found to be <b>more</b> cautious in the late morning than at dawn or in the afternoon, and <b>more</b> at night than in the daytime. Rates and methods of vigilance were found to vary with the aim of lowering risk from predators.|$|E
