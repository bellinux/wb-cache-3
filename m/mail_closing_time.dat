40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Closed</b> <b>time</b> is {{possible}} in several senses of ‘possible’. One might like to know, therefore, whether <b>closed</b> <b>time</b> {{is possible}} {{in the sense that}} it is compatible with standard metaphysical theories of time. In this paper I am concerned with whether <b>closed</b> <b>time</b> is compatible with A and/or B theories of time. A common enough view amongst philosophers is that B theories do but A theories do not allow <b>closed</b> <b>time.</b> However, I show that prima-facie neither approach allows <b>closed</b> <b>time,</b> but that with a little work standard versions of both approaches do. This shows that there’s no special problem with the notion of eternal return...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To use hourly {{building}} occupancy data {{over the}} period of 2012 - 2014 {{to determine the effect}} of changes to library hours of operation on building occupancy near and in the hours leading up to <b>closing</b> <b>time.</b> Methods: Data were collected using an automated gate count system at the primary entrance to the library. The system tracked the occupancy of the building by comparing the number of entrances and exits hourly each day. Incremental changes to the library’s hours of operation occurred in the same time period for the years 2012 - 2014. This time period will be compared year-to-year. We will test whether changes in <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> {{have a significant effect on}} mean occupancy rates during each of the three hours leading up to closing. Based on a previous study which examined a smaller, six-week period between 2012 - 2014, we expect to find that as <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> is extended, building occupancy in the hours preceding <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> increases despite a decrease in occupancy at closing. Results: Mean occupancy during the hour before <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> did not change when <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> was extended from 9 PM to 10 PM. When <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> was extended to 12 AM, mean occupancy during the hour before closing decreased. Mean occupancy during the hour ending at 9 PM increased when <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> was extended from 9 PM to 10 PM. Mean occupancy during the hour ending at 10 PM increased when <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> was extended from 10 PM to 12 AM. We plan to also include data from the ongoing Spring semester in the final results. Conclusions: Occupancy near closing decreased as <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> became later. While occupancy near closing decreased somewhat, occupancy earlier in the evening increased as library hours were extended. The benefits of increased library occupancy appear to justify sustaining extended operating hours...|$|R

40|$|The {{governor}} actuators in some heat-engine {{plants have}} nonlinear valves. This nonlinearity of valves {{may lead to}} the inaccuracy of the opening and <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> constants calculated based on the whole segment fully open and fully close experimental test curves of the valve. An improved mathematical model of the turbine governor actuator is proposed to reflect the nonlinearity of the valve, in which the main and auxiliary piecewise opening and <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> constants instead of the fixed oil motive opening and <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> constants are adopted to describe the characteristics of the actuator. The main opening and <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> constants are obtained from the linear segments of the whole fully open and close curves. The parameters of proportional integral derivative (PID) controller are identified based on the small disturbance experimental tests of the valve. Then the auxiliary opening and <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> constants and the piecewise opening and closing valve points are determined by the fully open/close experimental tests. Several testing functions are selected to compare genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm (GA-PSO) with other basic intelligence algorithms. The effectiveness of the piecewise linear model and its parameters are validated by practical power plant case studies...|$|R
