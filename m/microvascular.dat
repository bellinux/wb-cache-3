5|$|Other, more {{invasive}} procedures, {{also exist}} for larger bone defects including mobilization of the inferior alveolar nerve to allow placement of a fixture, onlay bone grafting using the iliac crest or another large source of bone and <b>microvascular</b> bone graft where {{the blood supply}} to the bone is transplanted with the source bone and reconnected to the local blood supply. The final decision about which bone grafting technique that is best {{is based on an}} assessment of the degree of vertical and horizontal bone loss that exists, each of which is classified into mild (2–3mm loss), moderate (4–6mm loss) or severe (greater than 6mm loss). Orthodontic extrusion or orthodontic implant site development can be used in selected cases for vertical/horizontal alveolar augmentation.|$|E
25|$|The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) {{study showed}} that CSII {{patients}} achieved an A1c of 7.3% (much better than the 9.1% achieved for conventional treatment). This large and controlled study also showed that improvement in glycemic control could {{reduce the incidence of}} <b>microvascular</b> complications for type 1 diabetes by 60%. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) achieved similar conclusions when it studied glycemic control in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The UKPDS results proved that control of glucose levels to near-normal levels delays the onset and slow the progression of <b>microvascular</b> complications for Type 2 diabetes.|$|E
25|$|In general, erythromelalgia {{seems to}} consist of neuropathological and <b>microvascular</b> alterations. How this occurs in {{secondary}} erythromelalgia is poorly understood and may be specific to the underlying primary condition. Primary conditions that {{have been shown to}} elicit erythromelalgia are listed in diagnosis, below.|$|E
25|$|Nonproliferative {{diabetic}} retinopathy shows up as cotton wool spots, or <b>microvascular</b> abnormalities or as superficial retinal hemorrhages. Even so, the advanced proliferative {{diabetic retinopathy}} (PDR) can remain asymptomatic {{for a very}} long time, and so should be monitored closely with regular checkups.|$|E
25|$|Downstream {{tissue damage}} occurs due to (a) closure of {{downstream}} <b>microvascular</b> and/or (b) {{closure of the}} lumen at the rupture, both resulting in loss of blood flow to downstream capillary microvasulature. This is the principal mechanism of myocardial infarction, stroke or other related cardiovascular disease problems.|$|E
25|$|In severe cases, a Endoscopic {{thoracic}} sympathectomy (ETS) procedure can be performed. Here, {{the nerves}} that signal {{the blood vessels}} of the fingertips to constrict are surgically cut. <b>Microvascular</b> surgery of the affected areas is another possible therapy however this procedure {{should be considered as}} a last resort.|$|E
25|$|Primary erythromelalgia is {{a better}} {{understood}} autosomal dominant disorder. The neuropathological symptoms of primary erythromelalgia arise from hyperexcitability of C-fibers in the dorsal root ganglion. Specifically, nociceptors (neurons responsible for the sensation and conduction of painful stimuli) {{appear to be the}} primarily affect neurons in these fibers. This hyperexcitability results in the severe burning pain experienced by patients. While the neuropathological symptoms are a result of hyperexcitability, <b>microvascular</b> alterations in erythromelalgia are due to hypoexcitability. The sympathetic nervous system controls cutaneous vascular tone and altered response of this system to stimuli such as heat likely results in the observed <b>microvascular</b> symptoms. In both cases, these changes in excitability are typically due to mutation of the sodium channel NaV1.7. These differences in excitability alterations between the sympathetic nervous system and nociceptors is due to different expression of sodium channels other than NaV1.7 in them.|$|E
25|$|Quantifying {{vasculature}} parameters such as <b>microvascular</b> density has various complications due to {{preferential staining}} or limited representation of tissues by histological sections. Recent {{research has shown}} complete 3D reconstruction of tumor vascular structure and quantification of vessel structures in whole tumors in animal models. This {{has been applied to}} assessing effects of chemotherapeutic drugs.|$|E
25|$|The {{release of}} {{endotoxin}} is the {{mechanism by which}} Gram-negative sepsis provokes DIC. In acute promyelocytic leukemia, treatment causes the destruction of leukemic granulocyte precursors, resulting in the release of large amounts of proteolytic enzymes from their storage granules, causing <b>microvascular</b> damage. Other malignancies may enhance the expression of various oncogenes that result in the release of TF and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which prevents fibrinolysis.|$|E
25|$|Hypertensive {{heart disease}} {{is the result of}} {{structural}} and functional adaptations leading to left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, CHF, abnormalities of blood flow due to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease and <b>microvascular</b> disease, and cardiac arrhythmias. Individuals with left ventricular hypertrophy are at increased risk for, stroke, CHF, and sudden death. Aggressive control of hypertension can regress or reverse left ventricular hypertrophy and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|Aggressive {{risk factor}} {{modification}} {{is required for}} effective treatment of <b>microvascular</b> angina where exercise plays a major role. Several other treatment strategies including b-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, ranolazine, l-arginine, statin drugs and potentially estrogen replacement therapy {{have been shown to}} relieve anginal symptoms as well as improve vascular function. Nitrates may be effective for symptom relief. Further studies are required to determine whether specific treatments are associated with improved survival as well as decreased symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Excess {{circulating}} thrombin {{results from}} the excess activation of the coagulation cascade. The excess thrombin cleaves fibrinogen, which ultimately leaves behind multiple fibrin clots in the circulation. These excess clots trap platelets to become larger clots, which leads to <b>microvascular</b> and macrovascular thrombosis. This lodging of clots in the microcirculation, in the large vessels, and in the organs is what leads to the ischemia, impaired organ perfusion, and end-organ damage that occurs with DIC.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of microfluidic-based devices, these {{limitations}} have been overcome. A new in vitro model, called SynVivo Synthetic <b>microvascular</b> network (SMN) was produced by the CFD Research Corporation (CFDRC) and developed using the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) based soft-lithography process. The SMN can recreate the complex in vivo vasculature, including geometrical features, flow conditions, and reagent volumes, thereby providing a biologically realistic environment for studying the extravasation cellular behavior, but also for drug delivery and drug discovery.|$|E
25|$|When skin defects {{are small}} in size, most can be {{repaired}} with simple repair where skin edges are approximated and closed with sutures. This {{will result in}} a linear scar. If the repair is made along a natural skin fold or wrinkle line, the scar will be hardly visible. Larger defects may require repair with a skin graft, local skin flap, pedicled skin flap, or a <b>microvascular</b> free flap. Skin grafts and local skin flaps are by far more common than the other listed choices.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} {{mechanisms by}} which drotrecogin exerts its effect on survival in patients with severe sepsis is not completely understood. In vitro data suggest that activated protein C exerts an antithrombotic effect by inhibiting factors Va and VIIIa, {{and that it has}} indirect profibrinolytic activity by inhibiting plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). In vitro data also suggest that activated protein C may exert an anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting tumor necrosis factor production, by blocking leukocyte adhesion to selectins, and by limiting the thrombin-induced inflammatory responses within the <b>microvascular</b> endothelium.|$|E
25|$|BBB can {{be broken}} centripetally (the most normal) or centrifugally. Several {{possible}} biochemical disrupters were proposed. Some hypotheses about how the BBB is compromised revolve around the presence of compounds in the blood that could interact with vessels only in the NAWM areas. The permeability of two cytokines, Interleukin 15 and LPS, {{may be involved in}} BBB breakdown. Breakdown is responsible for monocyte infiltration and inflammation in the brain. Monocyte migration and LFA-1-mediated attachment to brain <b>microvascular</b> endothelia is regulated by SDF-1alpha through Lyn kinase.|$|E
25|$|The main {{goals of}} {{treatment}} in distributive shock are {{to reverse the}} underlying cause and achieve hemodynamic stabilization. Immediate treatment involves fluid resuscitation {{and the use of}} vasoactive drugs, both vasopressors and inotropes. Hydrocortisone is used for patients whose hypotension does not respond to fluid resuscitation and vasopressors. Opening and keeping open the microcirculation is a consideration in the treatment of distributive shock, as a result limiting the use of vasopressors has been suggested. Control of inflammation, vascular function and coagulation to correct pathological differences in blood flow and <b>microvascular</b> shunting has been pointed to as a potentially important adjunct goal in the treatment of distributive shock.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that latent HIV can cross the blood–brain barrier inside circulating monocytes in the bloodstream ("Trojan horse theory") within the first 14 days of infection. Once inside, these monocytes become activated and are transformed into macrophages. Activated macrophages release virions into the brain tissue proximate to brain microvessels. These viral particles likely {{attract the attention of}} sentinel brain microglia and perivascular macrophages initiating an inflammatory cascade that may cause a series of intracellular signaling in brain <b>microvascular</b> endothelial cells and damage the functional and structural integrity of the BBB. This inflammation is HIV encephalitis (HIVE). Instances of HIVE probably occur throughout the course of AIDS and are a precursor for HIV-associated dementia (HAD). The premier model for studying HIV and HIVE is the simian model.|$|E
25|$|Acute lung injury (ALI), {{also called}} non-cardiogenic {{pulmonary}} edema, {{is characterized by}} the abrupt onset of significant hypoxemia and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates in the absence of cardiac failure. The core pathology is disruption of the capillary-endothelial interface: this actually refers to two separate barriers – the endothelium and the basement membrane of the alveolus. In the acute phase of ALI, there is increased permeability of this barrier and protein rich fluid leaks out of the capillaries. There are two types of alveolar epithelial cells – Type 1 pneumocytes represent 90% of the cell surface area, and are easily damaged. Type 2 pneumocytes are more resistant to damage, which is important as these cells produce surfactant, transport ions and proliferate and differentiate into Type 1 cells. The damage to the endothelium and the alveolar epithelium results in the creation of an open interface between the lung and the blood, facilitating the spread of micro-organisms from the lung systemically, stoking up a systemic inflammatory response. Moreover, the injury to epithelial cells handicaps the lung’s ability to pump fluid out of airspaces. Fluid filled airspaces, loss of surfactant, <b>microvascular</b> thrombosis and disorganized repair (which leads to fibrosis) reduces resting lung volumes (decreased compliance), increasing ventilation-perfusion mismatch, right to left shunt and the work of breathing. In addition, lymphatic drainage of lung units appears to be curtailed—stunned by the acute injury—which contributes to the build-up of extravascular fluid. Some patients rapidly recover from ALI and have no permanent sequelae. Prolonged inflammation and destruction of pneumocytes leads to fibroblastic proliferation, hyaline membrane formation, tracheal remodeling and lung fibrosis. This fibrosing alveolitis may become apparent as early as five days after the initial injury. Subsequent recovery may be characterized by reduced physiologic reserve, and increased susceptibility to further lung injuries. Extensive <b>microvascular</b> thrombosis may lead to pulmonary hypertension, myocardial dysfunction and systemic hypotension.|$|E
25|$|The blood–brain barrier acts very {{effectively}} {{to protect the}} brain from most pathogens. Thus, blood-borne infections of the brain are very rare. Infections {{of the brain that}} do occur are often very serious and difficult to treat. Antibodies are too large to cross the blood–brain barrier, and only certain antibiotics are able to pass. In some cases, a drug has to be administered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where it can enter the brain by crossing the blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier. However, not all drugs that are delivered directly to the CSF can effectively penetrate the CSF barrier and enter the brain. The blood–brain barrier becomes more permeable during inflammation. This allows some antibiotics and phagocytes to move across the BBB. However, this also allows bacteria and viruses to infiltrate the BBB. Examples of pathogens that can traverse the BBB and the diseases they cause include toxoplasma gondii which causes toxoplasmosis, spirochetes like Borrelia which causes Lyme disease, Group B streptococci which causes meningitis in newborns, and Treponema pallidum which causes syphilis. Some of these harmful bacteria gain access by releasing cytotoxins like pneumolysin which have a direct toxic effect on brain <b>microvascular</b> endothelium and tight junctions.|$|E
2500|$|Cardiac {{syndrome}} X, sometimes {{known as}} <b>microvascular</b> angina {{is characterized by}} angina-like chest pain, {{in the context of}} normal epicardial coronary arteries (the largest vessels {{on the surface of the}} heart, prior to significant branching) on angiography. The original definition of cardiac syndrome X also mandated that ischemic changes on exercise (despite normal coronary arteries) were displayed, as shown on cardiac stress tests. The primary cause of cardiac syndrome X is unknown, but factors apparently involved are endothelial dysfunction and reduced flow (perhaps due to spasm) in the tiny [...] "resistance" [...] blood vessels of the heart. Since <b>microvascular</b> angina is not characterized by major arterial blockages, it is harder to recognize and diagnose. <b>Microvascular</b> angina was previously considered a rather benign condition, but more recent data has changed this attitude. Studies, including the Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE), suggest that <b>microvascular</b> angina is part of the pathophysiology of ischemic heart disease, perhaps explaining the higher rates of angina in women than in men, as well as their predilection towards ischemia and acute coronary syndromes in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease.|$|E
2500|$|Sottos {{has also}} {{focused on the}} design of <b>microvascular</b> {{networks}} for the distribution of active fluids in autonomous materials systems.

2500|$|Magnesium has an {{indirect}} antithrombotic effect upon platelets and endothelial function. Magnesium increases prostaglandins, decreases thromboxane, and decreases angiotensin II, <b>microvascular</b> leakage, and vasospasm through its function similar to calcium channel blockers[...] Convulsions {{are the result}} of cerebral vasospasm. The vasodilatatory effect of magnesium seems to be the major mechanism.|$|E
2500|$|Chronic {{hyperglycemia}} due to any cause {{can eventually}} cause blood vessel damage and the <b>microvascular</b> complications of diabetes.

2500|$|Diabetic {{retinopathy}} {{also affects}} microcirculation thorough the body. A recent study [...] showed assessment of conjunctival <b>microvascular</b> hemodynamics such as vessel diameter, {{red blood cell}} velocity and wall shear stress can be useful for diagnosis and screening of diabetic retinopathy. Furthermore, the pattern of conjunctival microvessels was shown to be useful for rapid monitoring and diagnosis of different stages of diabetic retinopathy.|$|E
2500|$|Difficulty with {{nursing is}} the most common problem {{associated}} with clefts, but aspiration pneumonia, regurgitation, and malnutrition are often seen with cleft palate and is a common cause of death. [...] Providing nutrition through a feeding tube is often necessary, but corrective surgery in dogs can be done by the age of twelve weeks. [...] For cleft palate, there is a high rate of surgical failure resulting in repeated surgeries. [...] Surgical techniques for cleft palate in dogs include prosthesis, mucosal flaps, and <b>microvascular</b> free flaps. [...] Affected animals should not be bred due to the hereditary nature of this condition.|$|E
2500|$|This {{approach}} {{has been used to}} support repeated self-healing in fiber-reinforced composite materials. [...] An epoxy resin and a hardener can be stored in adjacent overlapping microchannel networks. Damage to the network structure causes the healing agents to autonomously mix and polymerize, effectively glueing together the damaged area. Healing was reported to occur at nearly 100 percent efficiency over multiple fracture cycles. [...] This {{approach has}} potential applications in the design and use of fiberglass and other composite materials for structures including airplanes and wind turbines. [...] It is reported that <b>microvascular</b> networks can support healing of larger-scale damage, up to 11.2 mm.|$|E
2500|$|Infections {{with the}} human malaria {{parasite}} Plasmodium falciparum are characterized by sequestration of erythrocytes infected with mature forms of the parasite and CD36 {{has been shown to}} be a major sequestration receptor on <b>microvascular</b> endothelial cells.

[...] The appearance of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) on the erythrocyte surface is a temperature dependent phenomenon which is due to increased protein trafficking to the erythrocyte surface at the raised temperature. PfEMP1 can bind other endothelial receptors - thrombospondin (TSP) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) [...] – in addition to CD36 - and genes other than PfEMP1 also bind to CD36: cytoadherence linked protein (clag) and sequestrin. The PfEMP1 binding site on CD36 is known to be located on exon 5.|$|E
2500|$|The blood {{does not}} come into {{direct contact with the}} parenchymal cells and tissues in the body (except in case of an injury causing rupture of one or more blood vessels), but {{constituents}} of the blood first exit the <b>microvascular</b> exchange blood vessels to become interstitial fluid, which comes into contact with the parenchymal cells of the body. Lymph is the fluid that is formed when interstitial fluid enters the initial lymphatic vessels of the lymphatic system. The lymph is then moved along the lymphatic vessel network by either intrinsic contractions of the lymphatic passages or by extrinsic compression of the lymphatic vessels via external tissue forces (e.g., the contractions of skeletal muscles), or by lymph hearts in some animals. The organization of lymph nodes and drainage follows the organization of the body into external and internal regions; therefore, the lymphatic drainage of the head, limbs, and body cavity walls follows an external route, and the lymphatic drainage of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvic cavities follows an internal route. [...] Eventually, the lymph vessels empty into the lymphatic ducts, which drain into one of the two subclavian veins, near their junction with the internal jugular veins.|$|E
