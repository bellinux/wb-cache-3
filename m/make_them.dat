5|$|All tiger sharks {{generally}} swim slowly, which, {{combined with}} cryptic coloration, may <b>make</b> <b>them</b> difficult for prey to detect in some habitats. They are especially well camouflaged against dark backgrounds. Despite their sluggish appearance, tiger sharks {{are one of}} the strongest swimmers of the carcharhinid sharks. Once the shark has come close, a speed burst allows it to reach the intended prey before it can escape.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{that are}} most active at dawn and dusk, when {{temperatures}} are cooler than mid-day, are called crepuscular. The subdued morning and evening light helps <b>make</b> <b>them</b> less visible to predators, but is bright enough {{to allow them to}} locate food. Some animals are crepuscular mainly because their prey is. Crepuscular animals in the area include mule deer, coyotes, porcupines, mountain cottontails, jackrabbits, and many songbirds.|$|E

Take it she did--for you know it's quite distangy here: {{everybody}} dines at the table de hôte, and everybody accepts everybody's wine. Bob Irons, who travels in linen on our circuit, {{told me that he}} had made some slap-up acquaintances among the genteelest people at Paris, nothing but by offering them Sham.|$|R
30|$|Despite their performance, ML network {{architecture}} <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> {{more prone to}} fail in reaching the convergence and overfit training dataset.

50|$|Drummond {{suggests}} in {{her paper}} in 2008 that computer-based information systems can undermine or even destroy the organisation {{that they were}} meant to support, and it is precisely what <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> useful that <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> destructive - a phenomenon encapsulated by the Icarus Paradox.|$|R
5|$|Batygin and Brown also {{predict a}} yet-to-be-discovered {{population}} of distant objects. These objects would have semi-major axes greater than , {{but they would}} have lower eccentricities and orbits that would be aligned with that of Planet Nine. The larger perihelia of these objects would <b>make</b> <b>them</b> fainter {{and more difficult to}} detect than the anti-aligned objects.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{the study}} are Churchill's bedroom and his ensuite bathroom, with sunken bath. At {{the time of}} the house's opening to the public in 1966, these rooms were not made accessible, at the request of Churchill's family but, shortly before her death in 2014, Churchill's {{daughter}} Mary gave permission for their opening, and the Trust plans to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> accessible by 2020.|$|E
5|$|During his pontificate Innocent XII {{worked to}} improve {{relations}} with Louis XIV of France.

5|$|Even though Opera Mini {{is based}} on the same {{rendering}} engine as Opera for personal computers, it does not pass the Acid2 test. This is because Opera Mini intentionally reformats web pages to try to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> more suitable for devices with small screens.|$|E
5|$|Female Carolina wrens possess song control {{regions that}} {{would appear to}} <b>make</b> <b>them</b> capable of singing with {{repertoires}} like the male. Due to vocalizations that they occasionally make with the male, {{it has been suggested}} that song perception plays a role and is of behavioral relevance.|$|E
5|$|Group E {{is located}} {{to the west}} of Group C. Group E is largely {{surrounded}} by steep ravines; the inhabitants of the city cut the cliffs to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> steeper and more defensible, and reinforced them with a retaining wall. Archaeological investigations failed to find any access stairway through the retaining wall to Group E.|$|E
