5|$|Bart and his catchphrase {{continue}} to be popular, while Krusty creates {{a wide array of}} merchandise featuring Bart's likeness. Bart becomes sick of his fame and begins to fear that the fad will wear off, so he tries to expand his act and personality during an interview on Conan O'Brien's late-night talk show, to no avail. Bart decides to stop performing, but Marge convinces him that he should continue because he <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> happy. Bart arrives at Krusty's show and enthusiastically delivers his line, but the audience is bored with the line and does not react. With fans no longer interested in Bart, Krusty ditches him.|$|E
5|$|Most {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of AML are caused by the replacement of normal blood cells with leukemic cells. A lack of normal white blood cell production <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> more susceptible to infections; while the leukemic cells themselves are derived from white blood cell precursors, they have no infection-fighting capacity. A drop in red blood cell count (anemia) can cause fatigue, paleness, and shortness of breath. A lack of platelets can lead to easy bruising or bleeding with minor trauma.|$|E

The best hemlock comes from Susa, while dittany, useful in childbirth, comes only from Crete. Wolfsbane comes from Crete and Zakynthos; it can be made into a poison that causes death a year or more after taking it, and there is no antidote. Hemlock is a poison which brings a painless death; pepper and frankincense are antidotes for it. Strykhnos causes madness, but oleander root in wine <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> gentle and cheerful. Birthwort has many uses including for bruises on the head, snakebite, and prolapse of the uterus.|$|E

5|$|Many {{commonly}} used antibiotics, such as metronidazole or the macrolides, will greatly increase {{the effect of}} warfarin by reducing the metabolism of warfarin in the body. Other broad-spectrum antibiotics can {{reduce the amount of}} the normal bacterial flora in the bowel, which make significant quantities of vitamin K1, thus potentiating the effect of warfarin. In addition, food that contains large quantities of vitamin K1 will reduce the warfarin effect. Thyroid activity also appears to influence warfarin dosing requirements; hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid function) <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> less responsive to warfarin treatment, while hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) boosts the anticoagulant effect. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this effect, including changes in the rate of breakdown of clotting factors and changes in the metabolism of warfarin.|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s, Cooper and Fazio {{argued that}} dissonance {{was caused by}} {{aversive}} consequences, rather than inconsistency. According to this interpretation, the belief that lying is wrong and hurtful, not the inconsistency between cognitions, is what <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> feel bad. Subsequent research, however, found that people experience dissonance even when {{they feel they have}} not done anything wrong. For example, Harmon-Jones and colleagues showed that people experience dissonance even when the consequences of their statements are beneficial—as when they convince sexually active students to use condoms, when they, themselves are not using condoms.|$|E
25|$|Antolin and Scarpetta (1998) using German Socio-Economic Panel and hazard model {{find that}} Socio-demographic {{factors such as}} health and gender have a strong impact on the {{retirement}} decision: women tend to retire earlier than men, and poor health <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> go into retirement, {{particularly in the case}} of disability retirement. The relationship between health status and retirement is significant for both self-assessed and objective indicators of health status. This is similar finding to the previous research of Blau and Riphahn (1997); using individual data from the German Socio-Economic Panel as well, but controlling for different variables they found that if individual has chronic health condition, then he tends to retire. Antolin and Scarpetta (1998) use better measure for health status than Blau and Riphahn (1997), because self-assessed and objective indicators of health status are better measures than chronic health condition.|$|E
25|$|Creativity {{is viewed}} {{differently}} in different countries. For example, cross-cultural research centred on Hong Kong found that Westerners view creativity {{more in terms}} of the individual attributes of a creative person, such as their aesthetic taste, while Chinese people view creativity {{more in terms of}} the social influence of creative people e.g. what they can contribute to society. Mpofu et al. surveyed 28 African languages and found that 27 had no word which directly translated to 'creativity' (the exception being Arabic). The principle of linguistic relativity, i.e. that language can affect thought, suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for 'creativity' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages. However, more research would be needed to establish this, and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> any less (or more) creative; Africa has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as music, art, and storytelling. Nevertheless, it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa, and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America. Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere, but here again there are cultural differences, even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity. For example, in Scandinavian countries, creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with life's challenges, while in Germany, creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems.|$|E
