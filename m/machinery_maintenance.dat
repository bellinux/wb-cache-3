In later stages, Vibration Monitoring is a critical component of any Predictive Maintenance (PdM) Practices. Vibration Monitoring and subsequent analysis has helped in identifying an earlier consequence of breakdowns. [1]The idea of performing Predictive Maintenance to perform maintenance on the machines they exhibit signs of mechanical failure has become known as Condition Based Maintenance (CBM). Condition Based Monitoring System (CBMS) is proven technology to be less costly than the failure. A simple Consequence of Failure Analysis (CFA) is made to justify preventive maintenance activities.

As a proof of concept, we present a demonstration experiment in which patches of material are removed from a beam-like waveguide with emulated anechoic terminations using ultrasonic excitation. <br/...|$|E
