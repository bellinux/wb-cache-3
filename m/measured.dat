It is {{found that the}} classical <b>measure</b> and the R square <b>measure</b> exhibit somewhat similar aspect of stock market synchronous behaviour while the zero return <b>measure</b> provide a different finding. Further, cross-sectional analysis shows that inflation is generally positively correlated with the classical <b>measure</b> and the R-square <b>measure,</b> while it is negatively correlated with the zero return measure; and government accountability and trade openness is negatively correlated with the classical <b>measure</b> and the R-square <b>measure</b> whereas it is positively correlated with the zero return <b>measure.</b> Analysis of correction coefficient shows that the classical <b>measure</b> is positively correlated with the R square <b>measure</b> while zero return <b>measure</b> is negatively correlated with both this <b>measure.</b> We conclude that the classical <b>measure</b> and the R square <b>measure</b> of stock synchronicity is closely correlated while, the zero return <b>measure</b> captures an aspect of stock market behaviour other than stock synchronicity...|$|R

40|$|A microcomputer-based {{approach}} to the quantification of facial expression was used to <b>measure</b> and compare the smiling behavior {{of a group of}} Parkinson's disease sufferers, a group of patients with major depression, and a control group of comparable age. Subjects were asked to view a series of amusing slides and their expressions were recorded. The most animated smile for each subject was chosen for analysis and scores on 12 computer-generated <b>measures</b> were obtained using the Facial Expression Measurement program. These <b>measures</b> are end-lip <b>measure,</b> mouth width <b>measure,</b> mouth-opening <b>measure,</b> mid-top <b>measure,</b> mid-lower lip <b>measure,</b> top lip-thickness <b>measure,</b> lower lip-thickness <b>measure,</b> eye-opening <b>measure,</b> top eyelid/iris intersect <b>measure,</b> lower eyelid/iris intersect <b>measure,</b> inner eyebrow <b>measure,</b> and mid-eyebrow <b>measure.</b> The depressed group differed significantly from the other groups, with higher scores on end-lip <b>measure,</b> mid-top lip <b>measure,</b> and mid-eyebrow <b>measure.</b> All subjects completed the Levine-Pilowsky Depression Questionnaire. The depressed patients obtained higher depression scores than the parkinsonian group, who in turn had significantly higher depression scores than the control group. The depression score was correlated with end-lip <b>measure,</b> mouth width <b>measure,</b> mid-top lip <b>measure,</b> eye-opening <b>measure,</b> and mid-eyebrow <b>measure</b> in the population as a whole. A significant negative correlation emerged between the depression score and mid-eyebrow <b>measure</b> in the depressed group.
