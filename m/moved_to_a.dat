40|$|Current CGSB testing {{standards}} (CAN/CGSB: 65. 17 - 1999) require that participants be able <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> vertical position in calm water tests only. The effect that two separate wave frequencies {{had on the}} ability of people <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> vertical position was investigated. Twenty-three participants were instructed <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> vertical position in the following conditions: calm water, a regular wave spectrum, and an irregular wave spectrum. There {{were no significant differences in}} the length of time it took <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> vertical position across all three conditions. Visual observations of the participants in the water suggest that more physical effort was required on their part to stabilize themselves while in waves. Two participants were unable <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> vertical position in calm water. In conclusion, the two wave spectrums tested increased the amount of physical effort required by the participants <b>to</b> remain in <b>a</b> vertical position, but did not significantly affect the time it took to do so.

5|$|Croatian {{authorities}} {{suspect that}} a further 61 individuals killed at Ovčara were buried there as well. They suspect {{one or more}} additional mass graves exist in the general area, or that the bodies originally buried at the site were <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> secondary grave. Nevenka Nekić, the Croatian {{author of a book}} on Nicolier, claims that an additional shallow grave was excavated at Ovčara in November 1991 and that Nicolier and 60 others were buried there. According to her, they were exhumed by Croatian Serb authorities and <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> secondary location in early 1992 because the grave was so shallow that body parts protruded through the ground surface.|$|E

5|$|In 1910, {{the family}} <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{neighborhood}} on Figueroa Street {{where they were}} the only Chinese on their block, living alongside mostly Mexican and Eastern European families. The two hills separating their new home from Chinatown helped Wong to assimilate into American culture. She attended public school with her older sister at first, but then <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Presbyterian Chinese school when the girls became the target of racial taunts from other students.

5|$|In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School {{opened a}} new music wing, and Holst {{composed}} St Paul's Suite for the occasion.

Holst and his family <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> house in Brook Green, {{very close to the}} school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925.|$|E

The clinic primarily treated gastrointestinal ailments, and because of her profound psychological problems she was <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> psychiatric facility, in Prangins {{on the shores of}} Lake Geneva. She was released in September 1931, and the Fitzgeralds returned to Montgomery, Alabama, where her father, Judge Sayre, was dying. Amid her family's bereavement, Scott announced that he was leaving for Hollywood. Zelda's father died while Scott was gone, and her health again deteriorated. By February 1932, she had returned to living in a psychiatric clinic.|$|E
