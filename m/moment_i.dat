5|$|Eight words spoken quietly, indifferently, without emotion. Eight short, simple words....For {{a part of}} {{a second}} I glimpsed my mother and my sisters moving away to the right. Tzipora held Mother's hand. I saw them {{disappear}} into the distance; my mother was stroking my sister's fair hair...and I did not know that in that place, at that <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> was parting from my mother and Tzipora forever.|$|E

40|$|Verse 1]How I love to {{turn back}} life’s pages,Just to drift back through memory. There were moments at diff’rent ages,When the whole world smiled on me. [Chorus] There were moments in early childhood,Happy <b>moments</b> that <b>I</b> recall;There were <b>moments</b> <b>I</b> strolled the wildwood,When ev’ning shadows began to fallThere were <b>moments,</b> when <b>I</b> grew older,That seemed sweeter than all to me,But the <b>moments</b> <b>I</b> spent with you, dear,Are my jewels of memory. [Verse 2]Could the moments stretch into hoursCould the hours stretch into years,Life on earth then would be a Haven,I could laugh away my tears. [Chorus...|$|R

40|$|UCI # 28. This {{is one of}} two <b>moments</b> <b>I</b> had at {{the gardens}} where I felt that I just couldn’t capture {{everything}} that my own eyes could see with just one picture. So I took a panorama. This is one of many <b>moments</b> <b>I</b> had this week where I felt so restricted with what my camera saw and what my eyes saw. [URL]...|$|R
5|$|We {{went into}} the booth to record the song. She {{originally}} {{wanted to do a}} Mike Skinner thing, rapping the verse and singing the chorus. But I asked her to sing it all, and she just made up the whole melody on the spot, and sang this amazing solo. At that <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> realised that this girl has a really special gift.|$|E
5|$|From {{the very}} beginning, {{from the first}} <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> may almost say, of my {{acquaintance}} with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that the groundwork of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike. And I had not known you a month before I felt {{that you were the}} last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.|$|E
25|$|I {{always made}} it a point to carry several extra copies of the {{leaflets}} with me whenever I was walking through the city – specifically for that purpose. Whenever I saw an opportune <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> took it. Another Sophie Scholl quote.|$|E

25|$|At this <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> {{have to tell}} Germany, I have {{to report}} to the Fuehrer in particular, that the {{thoughts}} of all my countrymen were with me in this fight; that the Fuehrer and his faithful people were thinking of me. This thought gave me the strength to succeed in this fight. It gave me the courage and the endurance to win this victory for Germany's colors.|$|E
25|$|I recall my thrilled first exposure, as a teenager, {{to one of}} his long-necked women, {{with their}} piquantly tipped heads and mask-like faces. The rakish stylization and the {{succulent}} color were easy to enjoy, and the payoff was sanguinely erotic in a way that endorsed my personal wishes to be bold and tender and noble, overcoming the wimp that I was. In that <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> used up Modigliani's value for my life. But in museums ever since I have been happy to salute his pictures with residually grateful, quick looks.|$|E

25|$|So at this <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> begin my {{tenure in}} this Chamber, {{uncertain}} of what history will say of my tenure here. I come here green {{with only a}} desire to make our great country even greater. We have much work to do. In that spirit, I pledge to each of you that any disagreements we may have are just that and no more. Walking in each other's shoes takes effort and pause; however, it is my sincere hope that I never lose the patience to view each of you as human beings first, God's creatures, and foremost. I deeply appreciate this opportunity to serve with each of you. I very much look forward to getting to know you better.|$|E
25|$|I {{put before}} the whole House my own views with an appalling frankness. From 1933, I {{and my friends}} were all very worried about what was {{happening}} in Europe. You will remember at that time the Disarmament Conference was sitting in Geneva. You will remember at that time there was probably a stronger pacifist feeling running through the country {{than at any time since}} the War. I am speaking of 1933 and 1934. You will remember the election at Fulham in the autumn of 1933...That was the feeling of the country in 1933. My position as a leader of a great party was not altogether a comfortable one. I asked myself what chance was there...within the next year or two of that feeling being so changed that the country would give a mandate for rearmament? Supposing I had gone to the country and said that Germany was rearming and we must rearm, does anybody think that this pacific democracy would have rallied to that cry at that <b>moment!</b> <b>I</b> cannot think of anything that would have made the loss of the election from my point of view more certain...We got from the country – with a large majority – a mandate for doing a thing that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible.|$|E

500|$|Stewart is a 3.0 point player. She took up {{the sport}} while {{attending}} the University of NSW following a visit by a Wheelchair Sports NSW road show. [...] "From the <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> jumped in the basketball chair and started playing", she later recalled, [...] "it felt like Quidditch on wheels!" [...] From 2003 to 2012, she had a scholarship with the New South Wales Institute of Sport.|$|E
500|$|In a 2003 interview, Jordison {{explained}} {{that despite the}} initial problems more than enough material was written for the album and added that [...] "it's better to have stuff to pick from than to settle for shit", in contrast to how Slipknot settled too soon with fewer songs on previous albums. Band members were divided over their experience of working with producer Rubin; some doubted his commitment to Slipknot as he split his time between many artists at once. Lead vocalist Corey Taylor admitted {{in an interview that}} he drank heavily throughout their time in the mansion, saying [...] "I would drink from the <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> got up until the <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> passed out." [...] He {{explained that}}; [...] "everything I did while I was drinking sounded like shit", while expressing how unhappy he was with the choice of vocal takes which ended up on the album. During this time, percussionist Crahan worked on , a video documenting the creation process of the album and the touring which would follow.|$|E
500|$|The {{composition}} comprises two verses, a two-round instrumental break, and two further verses. In his lyrics, Harrison unashamedly states {{his love}} for Boyd; Pollack describes the message as [...] "unusually unmuddled romantic euphoria". Early in the song, Harrison tells her, [...] "I loved you from the <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> saw you", and by the last verse, {{in the description of}} author Ian Inglis, [...] " [...] 'sweet and lovely' personality makes her irresistible... he now loves her 'more than ever.'" ...|$|E
60|$|My hostess became {{thoughtful}} {{for a few}} <b>moments.</b> <b>I</b> {{could not}} flatter myself that it was disappointment which had furrowed her brow. She had, however, the air of one who finds it necessary to readjust her plans. It was during those few <b>moments</b> that <b>I</b> noticed the bulge in the curtains, concerning which I was wise enough to hold my peace.|$|R

That's really {{important}} for me, the feeling is good. The car is really, really fast and my arm is much better, so everything is perfect for the moment." [...] Guy Fréquelin, the Team Principal at [...] Citroën Total was also pleased with Leob's and Sordo's results. He said afterwards, ...|$|E
500|$|While {{fronting}} the band, Dickinson {{also came}} across Iron Maiden {{for the first}} time, who were supporting Samson at the Music Machine in 1980. As Dickinson recalls; [...] "I was watching them, and they were good, really fucking good, and at that <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> remember thinking, 'I wanna fucking sing for that band. In fact, I'm going to sing for that band! I know I'm going to sing for that band!' ... I just thought, 'This is really me. Not Samson.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Whereas {{the first}} song {{was a little bit}} more artistic and a little bit more soulful, and it has done everything, it {{probably}} exceeded my expectations, I mean, from the <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> was able to give it away. I was able to kind of be reintroduced in a way musically, and thank you to [...] Diplo, but 'Scream' is really like the next step. It's just in time for summer and the type of experience that I want people {{to get out of the}} album.|$|E
