5|$|Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and {{reported}} {{them with an}} 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement, though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he {{was never going to}} cut <b>me</b> <b>much</b> slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E

25|$|Since {{my life as}} a {{prisoner}} has begun, I have heard the teachings of the white man's religion, and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers... Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped <b>me</b> <b>much</b> during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because {{it seems to me the}} best religion in enabling one to live right.|$|E

500|$|In September 1954, {{he heard}} his minutes would be slashed, and after the second {{exhibition}} game, Pollard retired from the Eagles. As he was under contract, Pollard was threatened with legal action from General Manager Vince McNally. He avoided the legal tangle by never officially signing with another team again, thus voiding the reserve clause on his contract. Pollard explained his rationale in a 1954 interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer: [...] "I just got fed up... I knew they wouldn't give <b>me</b> <b>much</b> {{of a chance to}} play... I carried the ball only 23 times in 12 games last year, so something had to be wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|Production {{designer}} Cory Kaplan {{explains how}} she was attracted {{to the idea of}} using primitive materials when she states, [...] "We all see super-tech now, but the idea of low-tech was much more interesting to <b>me,</b> <b>much</b> more visual. So, you take elements of rock and steel and chisel them into interesting shapes." [...] She also describes the creation of the set by stating, [...] "I found the backdrop from Alien, and Bill Roe lit it very dimly and put it behind. And it was just this rotating platform with this humongous dental piece that could rotate around as well and pull his face apart." [...] According to Makeup Supervisor Cheri Montasanto-Medcalf, Matthew Mungle helped {{in the creation of the}} alien torture machine by making the cheeks and putting the hooks in. The makeup supervisor adds that the hooks would actually stretch out and that David Duchovny [...] "sat pretty good through all that." ...|$|E

500|$|Prokofiev's {{task was}} not straightforward; the film's 15 minutes of musical {{material}} was fragmentary, and scored {{for a small}} chamber orchestra. According to Prokofiev's own account, producing the suite was [...] "a devilish job", which, he said, [...] "gave <b>me</b> <b>much</b> more trouble than the music for the film itself, since I had to find the proper form, re-orchestrate the whole thing, polish it up and even combine some of the themes." [...] He wanted the suite to appeal to Soviet audiences hearing concert music for the first time. In an article in Izvestia in 1934 he wrote of such music: [...] "Above all, it must be melodious; moreover the melody must be simple and comprehensible without being repetitive or trivial... The simplicity should not be an old-fashioned simplicity but a new simplicity". He worked quickly, and had finished the piece by 8 July 1934. Because it was published (Op. 60) by his regular music publisher in Paris, the French form of [...] "Kijé" [...] rather than the Russian [...] "Kizhe" [...] was adopted in the work's title.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Witherspoon {{starred in}} Vanity Fair, {{adapted from the}} 19th-century classic novel Vanity Fair and {{directed}} by Mira Nair. Her character, Becky Sharp, is a poor woman with a ruthless determination to find fortune and establish herself a position in society. Witherspoon was carefully costumed to conceal that during the filming {{she was pregnant with}} her second child. This pregnancy was not a hindrance to her work as Witherspoon believed the gestation had in fact helped her portrayal of Sharp's character: [...] "I love the luminosity that pregnancy brings, I love the fleshiness, I love the ample bosom—it gave <b>me</b> <b>much</b> more to play with", she said. The film and Witherspoon's portrayal of Sharp received mixed reviews, as The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Nair's cast is splendid. Witherspoon does justice to the juicy role by giving the part more buoyancy than naughtiness." [...] At the same time, The Charlotte Observer called her work [...] "an excellent performance that's soft around the edges" [...] and the Los Angeles Times concluded that Becky is [...] "a role Reese Witherspoon was born to play". However, LA Weekly wrote [...] " [...] ends up conveying so little of what’s at once appalling and perversely attractive about the would-be mistress of Vanity Fair" [...] and states that it may have to do with Witherspoon's vanity, [...] "with an Oscar-less young star’s need to be loved more than anyone could conceivably love the “real” Becky Sharp.". Others have stated she was miscast.|$|E
500|$|Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine {{gave the}} song {{a rating of}} A, and noted that [...] "Secret" [...] was {{probably}} the most naked performance of Madonna's career, with [...] "acoustic guitars, expertly sweetened vocals and producer Dallas Austin's signature R beats [...] soulfully transport the listener into Madonna's troubled yet soothing world." [...] Barbara O'Dair from Rolling Stone called the song [...] "infectiously funky", adding that her delivery of the lyrics [...] "Happiness lies in your own hand/It took <b>me</b> <b>much</b> too long to understand" [...] shows a downbeat restraint in her vocals that proves the singer is [...] "drawn to sadness". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic listed it {{as one of the best}} songs from Bedtime Stories, stating that along with other album tracks—"Take a Bow", [...] "Inside of Me", [...] "Sanctuary" [...] and [...] "Bedtime Story"—it slowly [...] "works its melody into the subconscious as the bass pulses". Paul Verna from Billboard described the song as a [...] "pop smash" [...] that is one of the most [...] "seductive" [...] songs from Bedtime Stories. Alex Needham of NME called the song an [...] "underrated gem", adding that the track has a [...] "brilliant bluesy strut". In his 2011 review of Bedtime Stories, Brett Callwood of the Detroit Metro Times called the song [...] "spectacular". Charlotte Robinson, writer from PopMatters, wrote that the gentle grooves of [...] "Secret", accompanied by acoustic guitar and delicate strings, make the song [...] "seductive".|$|E

2500|$|Mrs. Hancock {{said after}} the ruling: [...] "The money won't do <b>me</b> <b>much</b> good, but there's no other way they can pay.

2500|$|Forbes gave a {{negative}} {{review of the}} episode, criticising the Daleks' appearance so soon after Capaldi's entrance saying, [...] "It feels like the BBC have a {{lack of confidence in}} the public accepting Capaldi as The Doctor," [...] and the [...] "flawed" [...] concept of the episode. [...] They were critical of the characterisation of Capaldi's Doctor: [...] "the modern Doctor is not the irascible, self-centred William Hartnell of those early episodes." [...] But they were positive about the characterisation of Clara and overall said, [...] "Nonetheless, this action-packed second episode made <b>me</b> <b>much</b> more likely to tune in next week than last week’s opener.|$|E

He appears to have {{allowed himself to be}} frightened by this, and is now merely a practising surgeon, who keeps his Sunday in the old English fashion, and has let physiology and psychology alone for the present.

Looking back in 1860 on his controversies with Abernethy, Lawrence wrote of [...] "events which though important at the time of occurrence have long ceased to occupy my thoughts".|$|E

My arguments perverted some others, particularly Collins and Ralph; but each of them having afterwards wrong'd me greatly without the least compunction, and recollecting Keith's conduct towards me (who was another freethinker) and my own towards Vernon and Miss Read, which at times gave me great trouble, I began to suspect that this doctrine, tho' it might be true, was not very useful." ...|$|E
