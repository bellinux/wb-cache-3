40|$|Reverse {{transcriptase}} (RT) {{activity has}} been detected recently in all chicken cell-derived measles and <b>mumps</b> <b>vaccines.</b> A {{study of a}} vaccine manufactured in Europe indicated that the RT is associated with particles containing endogenous avian retrovirus (EAV- 0) RNA and originates from the chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEF) used as a substrate for propagation of the vaccine. We investigated the origin of RT in measles and <b>mumps</b> <b>vaccines</b> from a U. S. manufacturer and confirm the presence of RT and EAV RNA. Additionally, we provide new evidence {{for the presence of}} avian leukosis virus (ALV) in both CEF supernatants and vaccines. ALV pol sequences were first identified in particle-associated RNA by amplification with degenerate retroviral pol primers. ALV RNA sequences from both the gag and env regions were also detected. Analysis of hypervariable region 2 of env revealed a subgroup E sequence, an endogenous-type ALV. Both CEF- and vaccine-derived RT activity could be blocked by antibodies to ALV RT. Release of ALV-like virus particles from uninoculated CEF was also documented by electron microscopy. Nonetheless, infectivity studies on susceptible 15 B 1 chicken cells gave no evidence of infectious ALV, which is consistent with the phenotypes of the ev loci identified in the CEF. PCR analysis of ALV and EAV proviral sequences in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 33 children after measles and mumps vaccination yielded negative results. Our data indicate that the sources of RT activity in all RT-positive measles and <b>mumps</b> <b>vaccines</b> may not be similar and depend on the particular endogenous retroviral loci present in the chicken cell substrate used. The present data do not support transmission of either ALV or EAV to recipients of the U. S. -made vaccine and provide reassurance for current immunization policies...|$|R

The vaccine {{may be given}} separately {{or as part of}} the MMR immunization vaccine that also protects against measles and rubella. In the US, MMR is now being supplanted by MMRV, which adds protection against chickenpox (varicella, HHV3). The WHO (World Health Organization) recommends the use of mumps vaccines in all countries with well-functioning childhood vaccination programmes. In the United Kingdom it is routinely given to children at age 13 months with a booster at 3–5 years (preschool) This confers lifelong immunity. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the routine administration of MMR vaccine at ages 12–15 months and at 4–6 years. In some locations, the vaccine is given again between four and six years of age, or between 11 and 12 years of age if not previously given. The efficacy of the vaccine depends on the strain of the vaccine, but is usually around 80 percent. [...] The Jeryl Lynn strain is most commonly used in developed countries but has been shown to have reduced efficacy in epidemic situations.

40|$|RNA viruses {{exist as}} quasispecies, {{heterogeneous}} and dynamic mixtures of mutants having {{one or more}} consensus sequences. An adequate description of the genomic structure of such viral populations must include the consensus sequence(s) plus a quantitative assessment of sequence heterogeneities. For example, in quality control of live attenuated viral vaccines, the presence of even small quantities of mutants or revertants may indicate incomplete or unstable attenuation that may influence vaccine safety. Previously, we demonstrated the monitoring of oral poliovirus vaccine {{with the use of}} mutant analysis by PCR and restriction enzyme cleavage (MAPREC). In this report, we investigate genetic variation in live attenuated <b>mumps</b> virus <b>vaccine</b> by using both MAPREC and a platform (DNA MassArray) based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Mumps vaccines prepared from the Jeryl Lynn strain typically contain at least two distinct viral substrains, JL 1 and JL 2, which have been characterized by full length sequencing. We report the development of assays for characterizing sequence variants in these substrains and demonstrate their use in quantitative analysis of substrains and sequence variations in mixed virus cultures and <b>mumps</b> <b>vaccines.</b> The results obtained from both the MAPREC and MALDI-TOF methods showed excellent correlation.

40|$|AbstractMumps is {{an acute}} {{infectious}} disease caused by mumps virus, {{a member of}} the family Paramyxoviridae. With the implementation of vaccination programs, mumps infection is under control. However, due to resurgence of mumps epidemics, there is a renewed interest in understanding the antigenic diversity of mumps virus. Hemagglutinin–neuraminidase (HN) is the major surface antigen and is known to elicit neutralizing antibodies. Mutational analysis of HN of wild-type and vaccine strains revealed that the hypervariable positions are distributed over the entire length with no detectable pattern. In the absence of experimentally derived 3 D structure data, the structure of HN protein of mumps virus was predicted using homology modeling. Mutations mapped on the predicted structures were found to cluster on one of the surfaces. A predicted conformational epitope encompasses experimentally characterized epitopes suggesting that it is a major site for neutralization. These analyses provide rationale for strain specificity, antigenic diversity and varying efficacy of <b>mumps</b> <b>vaccines...</b>|$|R

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES [...] Since 1986, the {{national}} sentinel network in Switzerland (Sentinella) has collected reports of measles, mumps, and rubella cases {{in order to}} evaluate {{the impact of the}} Swiss MMR vaccination campaign (started in 1987) on disease frequency. DESIGN [...] Passive surveillance of clinical measles, mumps, and rubella cases through a voluntary physician based sentinel network in Switzerland. SETTING [...] Each year between June 1986 and May 1994, 150 to 200 general practitioners, specialists in internal medicine, and paediatricians in private practice covering the whole country have reported weekly numbers of consultations. PATIENTS [...] Every patient who fulfilled the case definition and consulted a physician participating in the Sentinella network was reported. MAIN RESULTS [...] Since 1986, the annual number of reported measles cases per physician has fallen [...] from 1. 3 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 11, 1. 50) in 1986 - 87 to 0. 4 (95 % CI 0. 30, 0. 50) in 1993 - 94. A decreasing trend, although less pronounced, was also observed for rubella. An initial decrease in mumps cases was reported [...] from 1. 8 (95 % CI 1. 57, 2. 03) annually reported cases per physician in 1986 - 87 to 0. 7 (95 % CI 0. 55, 0. 83) in 1989 - 90. This was followed, however, by a net and sustained increase. In 1993 - 94, the mean annual number of reported mumps cases per practitioner reached 4. 7 (95 % CI 4. 34, 5. 01) which was the highest level since surveillance had started. Over the whole eight year period, reported mumps cases, in terms of the percentage of consultations, were four times more frequent in the French speaking part of Switzerland than {{in the rest of the}} country. The proportion of mumps cases in people reported to have been vaccinated also increased [...] from 10 % in 1986 - 87 to 60 % in 1993 - 94. CONCLUSIONS [...] Reductions in cases of measles and rubella but an appreciable increase in mumps cases have been observed in the past three years in Switzerland. This findings, combined with increasing vaccination coverage and the fact that 60 % of mumps cases are reported in vaccinated people, suggests that the overall efficacy of the <b>mumps</b> <b>vaccines</b> used in Switzerland is probably below 80 %. Under these conditions the goal of eliminating mumps will probably not be reached. Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of the different <b>mumps</b> <b>vaccines</b> used...|$|R

The results of a 3 -year prospective study of children (29 ̆ 635 months old) in Britain and Ireland with encephalitis and/or severe illness with convulsions and fever were linked to each child's vaccine history. Cases were reported via the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit's network. The self-controlled case-series method was used to investigate associations between immunization and acute potential adverse events. The risk periods investigated were 0 to 3 and 0 to 7 days post 9 ̆ 6 diphtheria, tetanus, whole cell pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b or meningococcal C conjugate vaccine and 6 to 11 and 15 to 35 days post 9 ̆ 6 measles, <b>mumps,</b> rubella <b>vaccine.</b> RESULTS. A total of 157 disease episodes from 155 children met the analytical case definition. There were 11 cases of herpes simplex encephalitis and 23 cases of primary human herpesvirus 6 and/or 7 infection.
