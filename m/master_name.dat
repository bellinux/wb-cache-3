However, largely due to political stalemate between Taiwan and China, Taiwanese industries which have migrated to China appear to be fragile on sensitive issues from time to time. Therefore, for prospective Taiwanese industry migrants, careful thoughts and strategies are required on how to achieve the goals of investment before a big move can be made. With the focus on strategic concerns and taking screw industry as the case, this study proposed that the ‘international complex interdependence model’ might be used by prospective Taiwanese business migrants to lessen the issues associated with the political dilemma between Taiwan and China. Specifically, Michael Porter’s five forces of industry competitiveness can be used first to analyze the competitive advantages of the industries in Taiwan. Then, Taiwanese industries may select a partner in a third country to complement each other based on the five forces analysis and the principle of international division of labor. The partnership may invest jointly in China to the advantage of the three parties. This kind of complex interdependence will have the advantage of softening potential issues arising from the political arena between the Taiwanese and Chinese governments. Besides, the model might create demands for the industries in the markets of the collaborating economies. 論文名稱：經濟全球化下產業外移策略之研究－以台灣螺絲產業為例－ A study on industry migration in a global environment: The case of the screw industry in Taiwan 頁數： 164 字數： 78, 000 校系（所）組別：國立中興大學國際政治研究所 畢業時間及提要別：九十二學年度第二學期碩士學位論文提要 研究生：林國興 指導教授：袁鶴齡 Lin Kuo Hsing Yuan Hau Lin 論文提要內容： 在國際關係理論中的新自由主義學者認為，國家經過理性選擇，希望建立機制或制度，透過與其他國家彼此合作與互賴，實現雙贏或多贏，讓彼此能共存共榮，以保證各自的生存與發展。 由於臺海兩岸的政治僵局，對兩岸企業的發展，所可能引發的脆弱性與敏感性，將會對台灣企業造成威脅，本論文即以台灣螺絲產業為例，探討產業外移策略的選項。 為探討產業外移的策略，本文特藉由國際複合相互依賴的形式，來化解兩岸政治上的僵局，而在經濟上，則透過波特產業競爭的五股力量分析台灣產業的競爭優勢，並與第三國企業合作，使台灣產業融入國際分工體系，再前往中國大陸投資，促成國際合作條件，以形成互利，創造彼此需求，企圖形成結構性力量，以化解兩岸因政治僵局所引起之威脅，以降低兩岸經貿互動的脆弱性與敏感性。目錄 第一章 緒論…………………………………………………………頁 1 第一節 研究背景與動機…………………………………………頁 4 第二節 研究目的…………………………………………………頁 12 第三節 研究範圍與限制…………………………………………頁 14 第四節 研究方法與架構…………………………………………頁 19 第五節 預期目標與章節安排……………………………………頁 21 第二章 文獻探討……………………………………………………頁 23 第一節 兩岸經貿互動的相關研究………………………………頁 23 第二節 台灣螺絲產業外移的原因、方式與困境………………頁 28 第三節 國際政治經濟的相關論述………………………………頁 31 第四節 小結………………………………………………………頁 39 第三章 台灣經濟產業的發展………………………………………頁 41 第一節 台灣經濟產業的概況……………………………………頁 41 第二節 台灣螺絲產業發展歷程及外移評析……………………頁 59 第三節 台灣螺絲產業之外移環境條件…………………………頁 75 第四節 我國政府、企業、民間角色與螺絲產業的關係………頁 93 第五節 小結………………………………………………………頁 101 第四章 台灣產業外移策略之探討…………………………………頁 103 第一節 經濟全球化下台灣螺絲產業外移策略評析……………頁 103 第二節 兩岸經貿新形勢的困境…………………………………頁 115 第三節 台商產業外移策略之探討與建構………………………頁 120 第四節 小結………………………………………………………頁 136 第五章 結論…………………………………………………………頁 139 第一節 綜述………………………………………………………頁 141 第二節 研究貢獻…………………………………………………頁 144 第三節 未來研究…………………………………………………頁 146 附錄……………………………………………………………………頁 147 表目次 1. 表 1 - 1 1990 - 2003 年中華民國螺絲類產品出口統計表…………. ………… 頁 3 2. 表 1 - 2 台商大陸經濟十大違法行為………………………………………… 頁 16 3. 表 3 - 1 近五年螺絲螺帽市場變化趨勢……………………………………… 頁 42 4. 表 3 - 2 我國螺絲螺帽產品產銷概況………………………………………… 頁 43 5. 表 3 - 3 1991 - 2002 年中華民國螺絲類產品出口統計表…………………… [...] . 頁 45 6. 表 3 - 4 我國鋼鐵螺絲螺帽出口金額前 5 大國別排行榜…………………… 頁 46 7. 表 3 - 5 台灣螺絲螺帽產品前 5 大出口市場統計…………………………… 頁 47 8. 表 3 - 6 1991 - 2002 年中華民國螺絲類產品進口統計表…………………… [...] . 頁 49 9. 表 3 - 7 我國鋼鐵螺絲螺帽進口金額前 5 大國別排行榜…………………… 頁 50 10. 表 3 - 8 台灣鋼鐵螺絲螺帽主要出口國其進口概況………………………… 頁 51 11. 表 3 - 9 2002 年美國螺絲類產品進口統計表………………………………… 頁 52 12. 表 3 - 10 2002 年日本螺絲類產品進口統計表………………………………… 頁 54 13. 表 3 - 11 1999 - 2002 年兩岸螺絲螺帽貿易值統計表…………………………. 頁 56 14. 表 3 - 12 1999 - 2002 年我國螺絲螺帽與大陸貿易統計表……………………. 頁 57 15. 表 3 - 13 1991 年- 2002 年我國螺絲類產品生產數量統計表………………… 頁 63 16. 表 3 - 14 台灣製造業對外投資實況調查報告…………………………………. 頁 69 17. 表 3 - 15 國內大型螺絲廠海外投資一覽表…………………………………… 頁 70 18. 表 3 - 16 兩岸螺絲螺帽產業各項要素比較分析……………………………… 頁 84 19. 表 3 - 17 政府對產業群聚升級的影響………………………………………… 頁 95 20. 表 4 - 1 從螺絲產業生命週期看產業外移大陸的策略……………………… 頁 108 21. 表 4 - 2 從產業分工體系看台灣產業外移大陸的策略……………………… 頁 113 圖目次 1. 圖 1 - 3 論文架構……………………………………………………………… 頁 20 2. 圖 2 - 1 麥克．波特主導產業競爭的五股力量………………………………. 頁 31 3. 圖 3 - 1 螺絲螺帽上下游產業圖……………………………………………… 頁 59 4. 圖 3 - 2 螺絲生產流程………………………………………………………… 頁 64 5. 圖 3 - 3 螺帽生產流程………………………………………………………… 頁 65 6. 圖 3 - 4 我國螺絲螺帽產業上中下游與周邊支援體系關聯圖……………… 頁 66 7. 圖 3 - 5 我國螺絲螺帽產業SWOT分析……………………………………… 頁 82 8. 圖 3 - 6 中國大陸螺絲螺帽產業SWOT分析………………………………… 頁 83 9. 圖 4 - 1 我國螺絲螺帽產品生命週期分析…………………………………… 頁 105 10. 圖 4 - 2 製造業分工結構圖…………………………………………………… 頁 110 11. 圖 4 - 3 亞太產業分工圖……………………………………………………… 頁 111 12. 圖 4 - 4 兩岸產業合作進程與複合互賴形成示意圖………………………… 頁 129 13. 圖 4 - 5 行為者合作條件形成與結果之模式………………………………… 頁 130 14. 圖 4 - 6 台灣（強企業）與中國大陸（弱企業）連結模式………………… 頁 132 15. 圖 4 - 7 台灣（強企業）與中國大陸（強企業）連結模式……………………. 頁 133 16. 圖 4 - 8 台灣政府與中國政府連結之模式…………………………………… 頁 13...|$|E
