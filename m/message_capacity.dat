40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the <b>message</b> {{delivery}} <b>capacity</b> problem in delay-constrained mobile sensor networks. The <b>message</b> delivery <b>capacity</b> specifies the maximum percentage of sensing messages {{that can be}} successfully delivered to sink nodes within a given time constraint. This captures the overall system capacity in terms of successful sensing message delivery. By taking full advantage of sensor mobility and rendezvous during senor node encounters, messages can be delivered to a sink node either directly or through relays by other sensor nodes. In this paper, for the first time, we present the delay-constrained <b>message</b> delivery <b>capacity</b> formulation in mobile sensor networks. The objective is to maximize the <b>message</b> delivery <b>capacity</b> subject to the delay and buffering constraints. We first identify a number of unique challenges involved in such systems including message relay and buffer replacement mechanisms, and we derive the capacity bound under perfect message relay and buffer replacement mechanisms. Due to an unrealistic assumption about the foreknowledge of sensor moving trajectories, we next proceed to propose a practical algorithm to approximate the maximal <b>message</b> delivery <b>capacity</b> based on current global network knowledge. Furthermore, a distributed algorithm is proposed to reduce the control overhead for information exchange. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms and examine their sensitivity with respect to delay constraints, buffer size and message relay, and replacement schemes...|$|R

Each network consists of erasure channels with state feedback. A passive eavesdropper is assumed to wiretap any one of the links. The capacity achieving schemes as well as the outer bounds are formulated as linear programs. The proposed strategies are then numerically evaluated and shown to achieve higher rate performances (up to a double single- or sum-rate) with respect to alternative strategies, where the network resources are time-shared among the two sessions. These results represent a step towards the secure capacity characterization for general networks.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the partial decode-and-forward (PDF) {{strategy for the}} Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay channel. Unlike for the decode-and-forward (DF) strategy or point-to-point (P 2 P) transmission, for which Gaussian channel inputs {{are known to be}} optimal, the input distribution that maximizes the achievable PDF rate for the Gaussian MIMO relay channel has remained unknown so far. For some special cases, e. g., for relay channels where the optimal PDF strategy reduces to DF or P 2 P transmission, it could be deduced that Gaussian inputs maximize the PDF rate. For the general case, however, the problem has remained open until now. In this work, we solve this problem by proving that the maximum achievable PDF rate for the Gaussian MIMO relay channel is always attained by Gaussian channel inputs. Our proof relies on the channel enhancement technique, which was originally introduced by Weingarten et al. to derive the (private <b>message)</b> <b>capacity</b> region of the Gaussian MIMO broadcast channel. By combining this technique with a primal decomposition approach, we first establish that jointly Gaussian source and relay inputs maximize the achievable PDF rate for the aligned Gaussian MIMO relay channel. Subsequently, we use a limiting argument to extend this result from the aligned to the general Gaussian MIMO relay channel.

40|$|Bit-Plane Complexity Segmentation (BPCS) is {{a fairly}} new {{steganography}} technique. The most important process in BPCS is the calculation of complexity value of a bit-plane. The bit-plane complexity is calculated {{by looking at the}} amount of bit changes contained in a bit-plane. If a bit-plane has a high complexity, the bi-plane is categorized as a noise bit-plane that does not contain valuable information on the image. Classification of the bit-plane using the set cripst set (noise/not) is not fair, where a little difference of the value will significantly change the status of the bit-plane. The {{purpose of this study is}} to apply the principles of fuzzy sets to classify the bit-plane into three sets that are informative, partly informative, and the noise region. Classification of the bit-plane into a fuzzy set is expected to classify the bit-plane in a more objective approach and ultimately <b>message</b> <b>capacity</b> of the images can be improved by using the Mamdani fuzzy inference to take decisions which bit-plane will be replaced with a message based on the classification of bit-plane and the size of the message that will be inserted.

We propose a method of combining steganography, cryptography for secret data communication.

This approach uses the discrete cosine transform (DCT) technique which used in the frequency domain for hiding data within image.

Grid based ionospheric models are generally used to estimate ionospheric delay for SBAS. In grid based model, SBAS broadcasts vertical ionospheric delays at the grid point, and users get their ionospheric delay by interpolating those values. Ionospheric model based on spherical harmonics function is another method to estimate ionospheric delay. This is a function based approach and spherical harmonics function is a 2 -D fourier series, containing the product of latitude dependent associated Legendre functions and the sum of the longitude dependent sine and cosine terms. Using ionospheric delay measurements, coefficients for each spherical harmonics functions are estimated. If these coefficients are known, user can reconstruct ionospheric delay. In this paper, we consider the spherical harmonics based model and propose a ionospheric delay estimation strategy for SBAS {{that can be used to}} mitigate ionospheric delay estimation error, especially in storm condition. First, coefficients are estimated under initial order and degree. Then residual errors for each measurement are modeled by higher order and degree terms, then coefficients for these terms are estimated.
