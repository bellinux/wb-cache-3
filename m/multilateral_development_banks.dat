5|$|Each of {{the core}} {{economic}} functions, consumption, production, and investment, have become highly globalized in recent decades. While consumers increasingly import foreign goods or purchase domestic goods produced with foreign inputs, businesses continue to expand production internationally to meet an increasingly globalized consumption in the world economy. International financial integration among nations has afforded investors the opportunity to diversify their asset portfolios by investing abroad. Consumers, multinational corporations, individual and institutional investors, and financial intermediaries (such as banks) are the key economic actors within the global financial system. Central banks (such as the European Central Bank or the U.S. Federal Reserve System) undertake open market operations {{in their efforts to}} realize monetary policy goals. International financial institutions such as the Bretton Woods institutions, <b>multilateral</b> <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> and other development finance institutions provide emergency financing to countries in crisis, provide risk mitigation tools to prospective foreign investors, and assemble capital for development finance and poverty reduction initiatives. Trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization, Institute of International Finance, and the World Federation of Exchanges attempt to ease trade, facilitate trade disputes and address economic affairs, promote standards, and sponsor research and statistics publications.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{municipalities}} {{and water}} agencies {{are engaged in}} international cooperation to improve access to {{water supply and sanitation}} in developing countries. As opposed to [...] "centralized" [...] international cooperation implemented by the French Development Agency or <b>multilateral</b> <b>development</b> <b>banks,</b> in France this form of aid is called decentralized cooperation. In 2002 the Court of Audit of France condemned decentralized cooperation by water agencies as contrary to their objectives. In response, the conservative member of Parliament André Santini, President of the Council of the Water Agency for Seine-Normandie and President of SEDIF, the utility in charge of water supply in the region of Paris, introduced a law passed in 2005 named after himself and former Senator Jacques Oudin. The Loi Oudin-Santini allows water agencies and municipal water companies to spend up to 1% of their budget on international cooperation. According to the NGO psEau the law could mobilize up to Euro 100 million. However, far from all water companies make use of the option provided by the law. The NGO s-eau-s (pronounced SOS) criticized the law, because it allegedly promotes the [...] "export of the French water management model" [...] and the [...] "conquest of markets by big French water companies".|$|E

This article reports on {{a review of the}} African <b>Development</b> <b>Bank’s</b> (AfDB) country strategy papers (CSPs) from a scaling-up perspective. It concludes, based on a sample of strategy and supporting documents, that the AfDB’s CSPs do not focus systematically on scaling up {{the impact of}} the projects and programs that this <b>multilateral</b> <b>development</b> <b>bank</b> supports. This is not surprising, since the AfDB’s corporate strategy, policies, and processes do not explicitly focus on scaling up. However, the review also concludes that key elements of a scaling-up approach are found in the AfDB’s CSPs. If they were systematically applied across the board, AfDB could readily turn its CSPs into effective scaling-up strategies...|$|R

During membership negotiations in 2015, China had {{to strike a balance}} between its own goals and its partners’ desire for a transparent and commercially oriented bank. To ensure the bank’s legitimacy, China has compromised with member states to create an institution which conforms to international best practices in development financing, and works with – rather than against – the existing MDBs to help close infrastructure gaps in Asia...|$|R
