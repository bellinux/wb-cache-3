Most accounts agree about her birth to Shama the courtesan and {{her death in}} the Vithoba temple when the Badshah of Bidar sought her. However, the characters of Sadashiva Malagujar (her alleged father) and Hausa the maid do not appear in all accounts.|$|E
5|$|Conservation {{efforts for}} Hydnellum are {{hindered}} {{by the fact}} that some species are difficult to discriminate in the field, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> determine an appropriate conservation status. Techniques based on species-specific PCR primers and DNA extraction from soil have been developed to detect the mycelia of various Hydnellum species without having to rely on the presence of fruitbodies, which may help conservation efforts as well as improve understanding of below-ground ecology. Similar techniques have been used to show that, in the case of H.aurantiacum and H.caeruleum, the fungus can persist below the ground for at least four years without producing fruitbodies.|$|E
5|$|Conservation {{efforts for}} stipitate hydnoid fungi are {{hampered}} by {{a dearth of}} information about their basic ecology, and so molecular genetic techniques are increasingly employed in attempts to better understand these fungi. In the case of Phellodon tomentosus, for example, there is little correlation between fruitbody appearance and below-ground mycelium, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> determine the distribution and rarity of the fungus with standard surveying techniques. Phellodon melaleucus and P.niger were included in a Scottish study to develop species-specific PCR primers {{that can be used}} to detect the mycelia of stipitate hydnoids in soil. DNA testing of collections labelled as P.melaleucus and P.niger from the United Kingdom revealed additional cryptic species. PCR analysis can be used to determine the presence of a Phellodon species up to four years after the appearance of fruitbodies, allowing a more accurate determination of their possible decline and threat of extinction.|$|E

5|$|DST's {{potential}} {{to save energy}} comes primarily from its effects on residential lighting, which consumes about 3.5% of electricity in the United States and Canada. Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light {{in the evening and}} increases it in the morning. As Franklin's 1784 satire pointed out, lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase, as in high-latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting, once a primary use of electricity. Although energy conservation remains an important goal, energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then, and recent research is limited and reports contradictory results. Electricity use is greatly affected by geography, climate, and economics, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> generalize from single studies.|$|E

Also, Karl Brown's original technique looked at many minisatellite loci at the same time, increasing the observed variability, but <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> discern individual alleles (and thereby precluding paternity testing).

25|$|In addition, a {{considerable}} number of mainly Late Cretaceous and Paleogene fossils have been described where it is uncertain {{whether or not they are}} anseriforms.

He remarked that the Eugenia had promise, but only if planted in the Colli Albani region. Columella mentioned {{many of the same}} grapes but noted that the same grape produced varied wines in different regions and could even be known under different names, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> track.

25|$|The {{problem with}} this {{sequence}} is in beat two: the grounded hind and foreleg are not diagonal pairs, but {{are on the same}} side of the horse (in this case, the outside). This means that the horse is balancing on only one side of its body, which is very difficult for the horse, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> keep the animal balanced, rhythmical, and keeping impulsion. A horse that is cross-firing cannot perform to the best of its ability, and can even be dangerous (such as an unbalanced, cross-firing horse who must jump a huge, solid cross-country obstacle). Additionally, it makes for a very uncomfortable, awkward ride, producing a rolling movement often described as riding an eggbeater, which makes it difficult for the rider to perform to the best of his or her abilities.|$|E
25|$|As income {{inequality}} has increased, {{the degree of}} House of Representatives polarization measured by voting record has also increased. The voting is mostly by the rich and for the rich <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> achieve equal income and resource distribution for the average population (Bonica et al., 2013). There is a little {{number of people who}} turn to government insurance with the rising wealth and real income since they consider inequality within the different government sectors. Additionally, there has been an increased influence by the rich on the regulatory, legislative and electoral processes within the country that has led to improved employment standards for the bureaucrats and politicians. Professors McCarty, Pool and Rosenthal wrote in 2007 that polarization and {{income inequality}} fell in tandem from 1913 to 1957 and rose together dramatically from 1977 on. They show that Republicans have moved politically to the right, away from redistributive policies that would reduce income inequality. Polarization thus creates a feedback loop, worsening inequality.|$|E
25|$|Morocco has a {{complicated}} system {{of water and}} sanitation tariffs and fees that consists of a large array of tariffs {{at different stages of}} the water cycle: water abstraction, sale in bulk, retail sales, as well as the collection, treatment and discharge of wastewater. Urban tariffs are differentiated by locality, by the quantity consumed, and by the type of use (residential, public, commercial and industrial). Urban tariff review mechanisms vary furthermore depending on whether the service provider is private or public, the process for the latter being more complicated and cumbersome than for the former. In general, the level of urban water tariffs is high compared to other countries in the Middle East and North Africa, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> afford to the urban poor connected to the piped network. On the other hand, it is insufficient to allow for full cost recovery. 11% of all users, including a large share of poor users in both urban and rural areas, receive water for free from standpipes.|$|E
