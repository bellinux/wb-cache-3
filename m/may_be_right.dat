25|$|About Huxley himself {{we have a}} more {{complete}} record. As a young apprentice to a medical practitioner, aged thirteen or fourteen, Huxley was taken to watch a post-mortem dissection. Afterwards he sank into a 'deep lethargy' and though Huxley ascribed this to dissection poisoning, Bibby and others <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> to suspect that emotional shock precipitated the depression. Huxley recuperated on a farm, looking thin and ill.|$|E

[...] To avoid any {{appearance}} of bias, the Saginaw native noted: [...] "You may think I am a friend of these boys but I do not know either of them. [...] I hope you change your mind."

2500|$|In addition, Ribbentrop {{chose to}} spend as little time as {{possible}} in London {{in order to stay}} close to Hitler, which irritated the British Foreign Office immensely, as Ribbentrop's frequent absences prevented the handling of many routine diplomatic matters.

As Ribbentrop alienated more and more people in Britain, Göring warned Hitler that Ribbentrop was a [...] "stupid ass". Hitler dismissed Göring's concerns: [...] "ut after all, he knows quite a lot of important people in England."

2500|$|... "An angel or {{any other}} {{rational}} creature considered in his own nature, can sin; and to whatever creature it belongs not to sin, such creature has it as a gift of grace, and not from the condition of nature. The reason of this is, because sinning is nothing else than a deviation from that rectitude which an act ought to have; whether we speak of sin in nature, art, or morals. That act alone, the rule {{of which is the}} very virtue of the agent, can never fall short of rectitude. Were the craftsman's hand the rule itself engraving, he could not engrave the wood otherwise than rightly; but if the rightness of engraving be judged by another rule, then the engraving <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> or faulty." ...|$|E

2500|$|It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> to see Huxley's {{life and}} work as {{contributing}} to the secularisation of British society which gradually occurred over the following century. Ernst Mayr said [...] "It can hardly be doubted that [...] has helped to undermine traditional beliefs and value systems" [...] — and Huxley {{more than anyone else}} was responsible for this trend in Britain. Some modern Christian apologists consider Huxley the father of antitheism, though he himself maintained that he was an agnostic, not an atheist. He was, however, a lifelong and determined opponent of almost all organised religion throughout his life, especially the [...] "Roman Church... carefully calculated for the destruction of all that is highest in the moral nature, in the intellectual freedom, and in the political freedom of mankind". In the same line of thought, in an article in Popular Science, Huxley used the expression [...] "the so-called Christianity of Catholicism," [...] explaining: [...] "I say 'so-called' not by way of offense, but as a protest against the monstruous assumption that Catholic Christianity is explicitly or implictly contained in any trust-worthy record of the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} has also received comments by publications for manga, anime and other media. When Gundam SEED was {{during its first}} episodes in Japan, Ever Cheung from Animefringe wondered about the future regarding Lacus and Kira as he noticed the two about to embrace in the anime's opening theme. He commented if his doubts <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right,</b> he would find the story more interesting that he thought. Kim Wolstenholme from Mania Entertainment liked Lacus's introduction to the series as it added tension to it the friendship between Kira and Athrun. Kim noted that while Lacus and Athrun were engaged, he wondered how Lacus and Kira started relating in the series. Ross Liversidge from UK Anime Network stated he did not expect Lacus's faction entrance {{to the war in}} the last episodes from Gundam SEED as it emphasized the disasters happening within the series. Wolstenholme liked how Lacus started to take place in the war as it contrasted her actions in the series' first episodes, while also delivering surprising revelations. Moreover, Chris Beverdige, also writing for Mania, found Lacus' development throughout these episodes interesting {{and at the same time}} comical due to the design of her ship and how it is decorated by the Haros she possesses. While reviewing Gundam SEED Destiny, Liversidge stated that Lacus had become [...] "a cult" [...] within the series' setting due to how besides being pop-idol, she is backed up by a large number of soldiers. Lacus' public appearance in the series to reveal that Meer Campbell was impersonating her and state her true intentions was also called [...] "totally mesmerising" [...] by Liversidge. Chantal Strand was praised for her performance as both Lacus's and Meer's English voice actress by Anime News Network writer Theron Martin for giving them quality distinct from the original Japanese version despite finding it varying at some points.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Legitimacy is a {{key part}} of the social {{requirements}} specification for a trusted virtual community environment (VCE). If an environment is not seen as legitimate, social conflicts may reduce community benefits like trade and ecommerce. Legitimacy must be built into a VCE at design time, or it <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> possible at all. This can be done using a legitimacy requirements framework (LRF) which interprets historical &quot;rights &quot; in terms of ownership of generic VCE objects. This involves more than merely specifying who has the right to do what to what, because objects may contain other objects, objects <b>may</b> <b>be</b> dependent, <b>rights</b> <b>may</b> interact, groups may have <b>rights,</b> and there <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>rights</b> to rights. A LRF could be used by software designers to derive legitimacy requirements for a wide variety of multi-user systems, from chat rooms to virtual realities. It would draw focus to common problems, and aid their common solution. A simple LRF is presented to provide a basis for designers of virtual social environments to copy, discuss or deviate from...|$|R
