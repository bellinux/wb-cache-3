40|$|Sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is an {{important}} biofuel crop that produces both food (grain) and biofuel (from stalk juice). The objective {{of this investigation was}} to assess the effect of different crushing treatments on juice extraction and <b>sugar</b> <b>quality</b> traits of sweet sorghum cultivars grown in different seasons. Three sweet sorghum cultivars along with three stalk crushing treatments namely (i) stalk only crushed (leaf, sheath and panicle removed), (ii) stalk plus sheath crushed (leaf and panicle removed), and (iii) whole plant crushed (but only panicle removed) were assessed in split–split-plot design during 2009 rainy (Kharif) and 2009 post-rainy (Rabi) seasons. The percent juice extraction and juice <b>sugar</b> <b>quality</b> traits were significant (P ≤ 0. 05) in different crop seasons, but were non-significant among cultivars and crushing treatments. Sweet sorghum cultivars grown during rainy season had significantly higher total soluble sugars (TSS), sucrose and purity per cent than in post-rainy season. Experimental variety SPSSV 30 showed significant superiority by 25 % in TSS and sucrose content than check namely CSH 22 SS. Effect of crushing treatments on juice extraction and <b>sugar</b> <b>quality</b> traits were non-significant except juice brix. It is recommended that the complete sweet sorghum stalks after removing the panicle can be crushed without the need for removing leaf and sheath both in large research trial samples, and bulk harvested stalks at biofuel processing facility. This will reduce processing time at the sugar mill and helps avoiding rapid deterioration of stalk sugars in the ambient field condition, as removal of leaf and sheath in sweet sorghum is highly cumbersome unlike sugarcane, where it is relatively easy...|$|R

40|$|The {{clarification}} of mixed juice {{has been the}} subject of research for decades, due mostly to its large impact on <b>sugar</b> <b>quality.</b> Much, if not all, of the work has however been done on mixed juice originating from milling rather than from diffusion. This paper examines a back-to-basics, laboratory approach, involving cane juices produced from conditions simulating milling and diffusion. Furthermore, different types of cane, for example fresh versus deteriorated, clean stalks versus stalks plus tops and trash, have been used. Saccharate and milk of lime have also been compared. Analytical techniques were carefully considered and methods such as X-ray fluorescence were used, and material balances across clarification were done. The laboratory work shows that, for the same cane quality, clear juice quality in terms of phosphate, calcium, magnesium, silica and sulphated ash is the same whether milling or diffusion has been used. Saccharate liming always yields better clear juice in terms of turbidity, colour, phosphate and calcium contents. Material balances closed well across clarification, except for phosphate and for silica; this highlights the need for sampling/analytical improvements for these two species.

The objectives of the present study were (i) to quantify the effects of planting time and genotype on stalk and biomass yields, juice <b>sugar</b> <b>quality,</b> and (ii) to identify the most productive genotypes and planting windows for sustainable feedstock supply. Four commercial sweet sorghum genotypes (SSV 84, SSV 74, CSV 19 SS, and CSH 22 SS) were planted on five planting dates (1 June, 16 June, 1 July, 16 July, and 1 August) during the rainy (June–October) season of 2008 and 2009 in Hyderabad (17 ° 27 ´ N, 78 ° 28 ´ E), India. Planting in early and mid-June produced significantly (P ≤ 0. 05) higher fresh stalk yield and grain yield than later planting dates. Commercial hybrid CSH 22 SS produced significantly more stalk, grain, sugar, and ethanol yield over genotypes SSV 84 or SSV 74. Based on the stalk yield, juice <b>sugar</b> <b>quality,</b> <b>sugar,</b> and ethanol yields, the optimum planting dates for sweet sorghum in semiarid tropical climate is early June to early July.

40|$|The {{filtering}} characteristics of raw sugar destined for refining {{have been the}} topic of much research. Investigations in South Africa {{on the impact of}} various components of raw sugar on the filterability characteristics of raw sugars started as far back as 1954. Worldwide, there is still no uniform method to determine the filterability of raw sugars for use in export agreements. To address this, the Sugar Milling Research Institute developed a method, called FilterKwik, specifically to predict the behaviour of raw sugar during the first stages of refining. The aim was for the method to be representative of general South African refinery conditions so that it could be used to rapidly assess the suitability of a raw sugar for refining, be it local or abroad, bearing in mind that different refinery processes may be sensitive to different raw <b>sugar</b> <b>quality</b> requirements. The FilterKwik method was earmarked to replace the SA Sugar Terminal method, in recognition of the value that this would add to the South African Sugar Association marketing strategy, pending a seasonal comparison study. This study was completed during the 2009 / 10 season when just under 400 raw sugar samples were subjected to duplicate analyses using the FilterKwik method as well as a range of other <b>sugar</b> <b>quality</b> tests typically performed by the Sugar Terminal laboratory.

40|$|A regular crystal form, in {{particular}} the absence of conglomerates, is {{an important aspect of}} refined <b>sugar</b> <b>quality</b> because irregularities increase the quantity of mother liquor which remains {{on the surface of the}} crystals or is contained within occlusions in the crystals themselves. This aspect of <b>sugar</b> <b>quality</b> is of greater importance when processing lower purity liquors due to the increased impurity load of the mother liquor retained by the crystals in these circumstances. The current technique for the quantification of conglomerates in sugar samples, namely the crystal regularity index, is based on the subjective classification of photographed crystals in terms of three or four groupings. Each of the groupings is given an arbitrary weighting in terms of crystal regularity and the total score for the sample is expressed as a percentage of the maximum score which could be obtained by a sample of crystals of perfectly regular shape. This technique is both slow and dependent on subjective classification by one or more observers. An attempt has been made to develop an improved technique for conglomerate quantification, automating the procedure as far as possible and replacing the subjective element of the original analytical method by using computerised image analysis procedures. After the extensive investigation of a number of possible classification criteria, some preliminary methods have been obtained which are based on the analysis of crystal shape and the characteristics of the crystal edges...|$|R
