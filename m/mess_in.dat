5|$|In 1973, {{the film}} was shown on Soviet {{television}} in a 101-minute version that Tarkovsky did not authorize. Notable scenes that were cut from this version were the raid of the Tartars and the scene showing naked pagans. The epilogue showing details of Andrei Rublev's icons was {{in black and white}} as the Soviet Union had not yet fully transitioned to color TV. In 1987, when Andrei Rublev was once again shown on Soviet TV, the epilogue was once again in black and white, despite the Soviet Union having completely transitioned to color TV. Another difference from the original version of {{the film was}} the inclusion of a short explanatory note {{at the beginning of the}} film, detailing the life of Andrei Rublev and the historical background. When the film was released in the U.S. and other countries in 1973, the distributor Columbia Pictures cut it by an additional 20 minutes, making the film an incoherent <b>mess</b> <b>in</b> the eyes of many critics and leading to unfavorable reviews.|$|E

25|$|The narrator (Phil Rice) {{states that}} {{increased}} cultural diversity has necessitated the exposition of previously unwritten rules {{regarding the use}} of male restrooms. According to these rules, males should use restrooms as quickly as possible, maximize physical separation from each other when using urinals, flush urinals when they contain concentrated urine, avoid stalls with unflushed toilets, and avoid eye contact and communication with others. The film depicts a scenario in which excess communication leads to a <b>mess</b> <b>in</b> the restroom and thus deficient hygiene and homeostasis, the latter of which is in the lowest tier in Maslow's hierarchy of needs. As the scenario continues, the restroom occupants turn to violence, leading to police and biological hazard team involvement that closes the restroom.

The tradition of the white bearskins originated in 1894, when Tsar Nicholas II became colonel-in-chief of the Scots Greys and presented the original white bearskins. Initially, this was because the Czar of Russia presented the kettle drummers with the white bearskins. Furthermore, the bandsmen, except those wearing a white bearskin, had a red plume on the side of the bearskin. The kettle drummers, with their white bearskins, wore a white plume. A tradition developed within the regiment of the Scots Greys band playing the Russian national anthem in the regiment's officers <b>mess,</b> <b>in</b> honour of Tsar Nicholas II.|$|E
