The large volume of questions {{makes it difficult for}} users to find questions that they are interested in answering. In this paper, we propose a number of approaches to predict who will answer a new question using the characteristics of the question (i. e. Topic) and users (i. e. Reputation), and the social network of Stack Overflow users (i. e. Interested in the same topic). Specifically, our approach aims to identify a group of users (candidates) who have the potential to answer a new question by using feature-based prediction approach and social network based prediction approach. We develop predictive models to predict whether an identified candidate answers a new question. This prediction helps motivate the knowledge exchanging in the community by routing relevant questions to potential answerers. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our predictive models, achieving 44 % precision, 59 % recall, and 49 % F-measure (average across all test sets). In addition, our candidate identification techniques can identify the answerers who actually answer questions up to 12. 8 % (average across all test sets) ...|$|R

60|$|This is {{obviously}} a most heterogeneous mixture, but to fully appreciate the diversity of its origin the several elements should be traced farther back towards their sources. Thus, the Moors are principally descendants of Arabs, who flooded the northern provinces of Africa in successive waves of emigration eastwards, {{both before and after}} the Hegira, partly combining with the Berbers as they went, and partly displacing them from the littoral districts and driving them to the oases of the Sahara, whence they in their turn displaced the Negro population, whom they drove down to the Soudan. The Gypsies, according to Sir Henry Rawlinson,[16] came from the Indo-Scythic tribes who inhabited the mouths of the Indus, and began to migrate northward, from the fourth century onward. They settled in the Chaldean marshes, assumed independence and defied the caliph. In A.D. 831 the grandson of Haroun al-Raschid sent a large expedition against them, which, after slaughtering ten thousand, deported the whole of the remainder first to Baghdad and thence onwards to Persia. They continued unmanageable in their new home, and were finally transplanted to the Cilician frontier in Asia Minor, and established there as a military colony to guard the passes of the Taurus. In A.D. 962 the Greeks, having obtained some temporary successes, drove the Gypsies back more into the interior, whence they gradually moved towards the Hellespont under the pressure of the advancing Seljukians, during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. They then crossed over to Europe and gradually overspread it, where they are now estimated to number <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>millions.</b>|$|R

A major part of thes crashes are rear-end collisions. Therefore the U. S. Department of Transportation has {{put a lot of}} effort in fostering the development of rear-end collision avoidance systems by funding governmental, academic and industrial research groups in the last ten to fifteen years. The intelligent criuse control field operational test (ICC FOT) [2, 3] represents an important milestone in thise line of research. With its various findings and its big amount of recorded data it is a valuable means for evaluating the impact of automated cruise control systems (ACC) on driver performance. This paper addresses the safety-enhancing potential of the ACC system in the ICC FOT. For the comparison of manual, conventional cruise control (CCC), and ACC driving behavior in car-following scenarios during the ICC FOT a novel performance map [4, 5] was applied. This map associates the exposed driving behavior with four driving states: low risk, conflict state and between the conflict and near crash state are based on the driver´s braking and steering respones in last-second evasive maneuvers of test track trials [6]. For a complete evaluation, a theoretical baoundary between the near crash and crash imminent state drived from vehicle dynamics will be introduced. Subsequently, by the means of this advanced driver performance map, an evaluation of the safe driving performance of different driver groups with and without ACC and CCC deployment will be shown. An analysis of the findings concludes this paper...|$|R
