40|$|Energy use in {{the brain}} {{constrains}} its information processing power, but {{only about half the}} brain's energy consumption is directly related to information processing. Evidence for which non-signalling processes consume the rest of the brain's energy has been scarce. For the first time, we investigated the energy use of the brain's main non-signalling tasks with a single method. After blocking each non-signalling process, we <b>measured</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>level</b> changes in juvenile rat brain slices with an oxygen-sensing microelectrode and calculated changes in oxygen consumption throughout the slice using a modified diffusion equation. We found that the turnover of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton, followed by lipid synthesis, are significant energy drains, contributing 25 %, 22 % and 18 %, respectively, to the rate of oxygen consumption. In contrast, protein synthesis is energetically inexpensive. We assess how these estimates of energy expenditure relate to brain energy use in vivo, and how they might differ in the mature brain...|$|E

40|$|Control {{of oxygen}} over cell {{cultures}} in vitro {{is a topic}} of considerable interest, as chronic and cyclic hypoxia can alter cell behaviour. Both static and transient hypoxic levels {{have been found to}} affect tumour cell behaviour; it is potentially valuable to include these effects in early, in vitro stages of drug screening. A barrier to their inclusion is that rates of transient hypoxia can be a few cycles/hour, which is difficult to reproduce in traditional in vitro cell culture environments due to long diffusion distances from control gases to the cells.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{cause of}} ulnar drift in {{patients}} with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is unknown. It may occur because of external forces applied to the fingers during normal use. Alternatively, it may arise after changes in the internal forces on the anatomy of the digits owing to alterations in the supporting structures of the joints or their control mechanisms, or both. Intrinsic muscle tightness, which is commonly seen in RA hands, {{may be the result}} of adaptive shortening or a direct consequence of RA. Previous studies carried out by our group have shown that joints, tendons, and associated synovium in RA hands are consistently hypoxic. Therefore, we formed the hypothesis that there is a difference in hand/forearm muscle oxygen tension in RA versus non-RA. METHODS: We <b>measured</b> tissue <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> in the intrinsic muscles of the hands and forearm muscles of 29 patients with a diagnosis of RA, who were undergoing elective surgery. We <b>measured</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> using a microelectrode technique. A total of 31 patients without RA undergoing elective surgery served as matched controls. RESULTS: Our results show that the intrinsic muscles of RA patients are significantly more hypoxic than in non-RA controls. Moreover, there is a trend in the RA group for increasing hypoxia in a radial-to-ulnar direction when comparing the different intrinsic muscle groups. We also demonstrate that forearm and thenar and hypothenar muscles are significantly more hypoxic in RA versus non-RA patients. CONCLUSIONS: The intrinsic muscle weakness, intrinsic tightness, and muscle wasting observed in RA may not be due to disuse atrophy resulting from joint disease. From our data, we speculate that these changes {{may be the result of}} direct muscular involvement in RA leading to muscle hypoxia...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{contribution}} of local VEGF production and subsequent angiogenesis within the synovial membrane to {{the propagation of}} arthritis is unclear. The relationship between synovial oxygenation and blood flow {{in the development of}} arthritic disease is unknown. We have therefore <b>measured</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> and perfusion rates in the synovial space in a murine model of arthritis. METHODS: Arthritis was induced in DBA/ 1 mice by immunisation with type II collagen. <b>Oxygen</b> and perfusion <b>levels</b> were measured polarographically using silver needle microelectrodes within the knee joints prior to and 10 days after the onset of arthritis. In addition, synovial cells were isolated from knee joints of naive, pre-arthritic and arthritic mice. RESULTS: Onset of arthritis was associated with a marked reduction in synovial oxygen tensions (pO 2). The perfusion rates in naive and arthritic animals were not significantly different: in naive mice, the rate was 0. 58 +/- 0. 11 ml/min/g and in arthritic joints, 0. 64 +/- 0. 17 ml/min/g. Furthermore, synovial cells isolated from the knee joints of naive animals did not express mRNA for VEGF, but significant levels were detected in cells from non-arthritic mice immunised with collagen. The onset of arthritis was associated with expression of VEGF mRNA and protein, and correlated negatively with pO 2 levels. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that decreases in intra-articular pO 2 occur in established arthritic conditions and may be the stimulus for local VEGF production. However, perfusion was not increased in arthritic animals and vascular density was unaltered, suggesting that the neovascularisation associated with inflammatory arthritis, is insufficient to restore oxygen homeostasis in the joint...|$|R

The development of formulations that increase skin oxygenation and of methods for <b>measuring</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> in skin are important for dealing with healing processes affected by the <b>level</b> of <b>oxygen.</b> We have use EPR oximetry in vivo to compare the influence of liposomal formulations of different size and composition with that of hydrogel {{with respect to the}} action of the entrapped benzyl nicotinate (BN). Following the topical application of BN onto the skin of mice, pO 2 increase was measured by low-frequency EPR as a function of time. The effect of BN was evaluated by 3 different parameters: lag-time, time needed for maximum pO 2 increase, and overall effectiveness expressed by the area under the response-time curve. An increase in skin oxygenation was observed after BN application. The results show that the effect of BN incorporated in liposomes is achieved more rapidly than the effect from hydrophilic gel. The composition of the liposomes significantly affects the time at which BN starts to act and, to a lesser extent, the maximum increase of pO 2 in skin and the effectiveness of BN action. However, the size of the liposomes influences both the effectiveness of BN action and the time at which BN starts to act. After repeated application of liposomes, the pO 2 baseline increased and the response of the skin tissue was faster.

For practical reasons, e.g., unpredictable tumor growth rates, we could not utilize a constant time frame between the [18 F]EF 5 scans.

Methods: Caco- 2 cells were cultured {{in three different}} systems, using conventional polystyrene 24 -well plates, special 24 -well gas permeable plates, or on membrane inserts in conventional plates. Optical sensor spots were used to measure dissolved O 2 levels in these cultured cells over the course of 6 days under normoxia (143 mmHg) and for 6 hours under hypoxia (7 mmHg). Western blot analysis was used to determine the protein levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α (HIF- 1 α) in the different cultures. Results: All culture systems displayed lower O 2 levels over time than expected when cultured under normoxia conditions. On average, O 2 levels reached as low as 25 mmHg in 24 -well plates but remained at 97 and 117 mmHg in gas permeable plates and membrane inserts, respectively. Under hypoxia, 1 mL cell cultures equilibrated to 7 mmHg O 2 within the first 60 minutes and dropped to 0. 39 and 0. 61 mmHg O 2 in 24 -well and gas permeable plates, respectively, after the 6 -hour incubation period. Cultures in membrane inserts did not equilibrate to 7 mmHg {{by the end of the}} 6 -hour incubation period, where the lowest O 2 measurements reached 23. 12 mmHg. Western blots of HIF- 1 α protein level in the whole cell lysates of the different Caco- 2 cultures revealed distinct stabilization of HIF- 1 α after hypoxic incubation for 1, 2, and 4 hours in 24 -well plates as well as gas permeable plates. For membrane inserts, notable HIF- 1 α was seen after 4 hours of hypoxic incubation. Conclusion: Cellular oxygen depletion was achieved in different hypoxic Caco- 2 culture systems.

To protect the steel components, this oxide layer must be properly maintained. However, too much oxygen will produce unwanted oxide precipitation within the coolant and elsewhere in the system. With the current generation LBE systems, the stability of the oxide layer on the internal components is maintained through controlling the temperature of the system and the dissolved oxygen concentration in the coolant. Controlling these two operating parameters is the key to operating LBE systems and minimizing corrosion. While the temperature of the system is easy to measure, the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the LBE is more complicated. Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) solid-electrolyte oxygen sensing systems are currently employed by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) scientists to <b>measure</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>levels</b> in the Delta Loop, an engineering-scale LBE experimental system. By measuring the voltage difference across the YSZ sensor, the oxygen concentration in test solutions can be determined relative to that in the reference solutions (the potentiometric method). The theoretical model for calculating oxygen concentration based on voltage measurements from YSZ sensors in static conditions is well understood. The real world performance of these systems, however, is less predictable. The primary goal of this research project is to examine the major factors impacting the performance of YSZ oxygen sensing systems. The research effort will serve to fill the gaps in the current sensor calibration/validation work and further the development of new sensors for oxygen concentration measurement in a nuclear environment. Ultimately, acquired data will lead to the full implementation of the instrumentation in the system. Through this work, the research group will also generate the calibration curves for the YSZ sensors over various temperature ranges...|$|R
