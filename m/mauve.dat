5|$|<b>Mauve</b> took Van Gogh on as {{a student}} and {{introduced}} him to watercolour, which he worked on for the next month before returning home for Christmas. He quarrelled with his father, refusing to attend church, and left for The Hague. Within a month Van Gogh and <b>Mauve</b> fell out, possibly over the viability of drawing from plaster casts. Van Gogh could afford to hire only people from the street as models, a practice of which <b>Mauve</b> seems to have disapproved. In June Van Gogh suffered a bout of gonorrhoea and spent three weeks in hospital. Soon after, he first painted in oils, bought with money borrowed from Theo. He liked the medium, and spread the paint liberally, scraping from the canvas and working back with the brush. He wrote that he {{was surprised at how}} good the results were.|$|E
5|$|In view of {{the healthy}} climate in the region, Punakha is the winter capital of Bhutan. The head of the clergy of Bhutan with his entourage of monks spend the winter in this dzong. Jacaranda trees grow around the dzong, {{blooming}} with <b>mauve</b> flowers in the spring.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a points classification, which awarded a <b>mauve</b> jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for {{finishing}} in the top 15 in a stage. The stage win awarded 25 points, second place awarded 20 points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point less per place down the line, to a single point for 15th. In addition, some points could be won in intermediate sprints.|$|E

50|$|Longmore {{falls in}} love with Madame de <b>Mauves,</b> but, {{understanding}} that he cannot be her lover, and believing that she desperately needs a friend, he tries to sublimate his love into friendship. This attitude is reinforced by Madame de <b>Mauves,</b> who welcomes his friendship, but is hostile to any sentiment on his part. However both the Comte de <b>Mauves</b> and his sister, the crass widow Madame de Clairin, hint that Longmore should woo Madame de <b>Mauves.</b> The Comte wishes her to take a lover so that he may be free to pursue his own affair.|$|R
6000|$|M. de <b>Mauves</b> {{seemed to}} express such {{satisfaction}} as could consort {{with a limited}} interest. [...] "It's needless {{for me to make}} you welcome. Madame de <b>Mauves</b> knows the duties of hospitality." [...] And with another bow he continued his walk.|$|R
5|$|Denis Menchov won the race, {{having taken}} the lead in a long time trial in stage 12, and defended vigorously against attacks by his closest challenger, Danilo Di Luca, during the {{mountain}} stages of the final week. Di Luca came in second, 41seconds behind the winner, and won the <b>mauve</b> jersey as points classification winner. Subsequent to the Giro, both he and third-place finisher Franco Pellizotti became embroiled in doping scandals, were given bans, and had their results stripped.|$|E
5|$|Another steep climb of 800 feet {{brought us}} to the Marei Parei spur, {{to the spot where}} the ground was covered with the {{magnificent}} pitcher-plants, of which we had come in search. This one has been called the Nepenthes Rajah, and is a plant about four feet in length, with broad leaves stretching on every side, having the great pitchers resting on the ground in a circle about it. Their shape and size are remarkable. I will give the measurement of one, to indicate the form: the length along the back nearly fourteen inches; from the base {{to the top of the}} column in front, five inches; and its lid a foot long by fourteen inches broad, and of an oval shape. Its mouth was surrounded by a plaited pile, which near the column was two inches broad, lessening in its narrowest part to three-quarters of an inch. The plaited pile of the mouth was also undulating in broad waves. Near the stem the pitcher is four inches deep, so that the mouth is situated upon it in a triangular manner. The colour of an old chalice is a deep purple, but that of the others is generally <b>mauve</b> outside, very dark indeed in the lower part, though lighter towards the rim; the inside is of the same colour, but has a kind of glazed and shiny appearance. The lid is <b>mauve</b> in the centre, shading to green at the edges. The stems of the female flowers we found always a foot shorter than those of the male, and the former were far less numerous than the latter. It is indeed one of the most astonishing productions of nature.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds exhibit fluorescence, that is, they emit {{light of}} various colors and intensities under long-wave {{ultraviolet}} light (365nm): Cape series stones (type Ia) usually fluoresce blue, and these stones may also phosphoresce yellow, a unique property among gemstones. Other possible long-wave fluorescence colors are green (usually in brown stones), yellow, <b>mauve,</b> or red (in type IIb diamonds). In natural diamonds, there is typically {{little if any}} response to short-wave ultraviolet, but {{the reverse is true}} of synthetic diamonds. Some natural type IIb diamonds phosphoresce blue after exposure to short-wave ultraviolet. In natural diamonds, fluorescence under X-rays is generally bluish-white, yellowish or greenish. Some diamonds, particularly Canadian diamonds, show no fluorescence.|$|E
50|$|Meung-sur-Loire lies 15 km to {{the west}} of Orleans on the north bank of the River Loire at the {{confluence}} with the River <b>Mauves.</b> The <b>Mauves,</b> actually three rivers, have their source in the water table of the productive agricultural region of the Beauce.|$|R
5000|$|A wealthy American {{man named}} Longmore is {{introduced}} to his countrywoman Euphemia de <b>Mauves,</b> {{wife of the}} Comte Richard de <b>Mauves.</b> Longmore and Madame de <b>Mauves</b> become friends, and he visits her frequently in Paris. Superficially, Madam de <b>Mauves</b> leads a happy life with a wealthy and [...] "irreproachably polite" [...] husband, but Longmore soon becomes convinced that she harbours a deep sadness. It gradually becomes clear that the Comte is an unscrupulous and dissipated man who married his wife for her money alone. As a youth, Madame de <b>Mauves</b> had been naive and idealistic, believing that the Comte de Mauves' title guaranteed a fine character. The Comte, however, proved to have little regard for his wife, and had embarked {{on a series of}} extramarital affairs. Even his politeness [...] "was hardly more than a form of luxurious egotism, like his fondness for cambric handkerchiefs.... In after years he was terribly polite to his wife." [...] Madame de Mauves' faith in her ideals is destroyed, but she responds with stoic resignation.|$|R

5|$|Scheer {{decided to}} reverse {{the course of the}} fleet with the Gefechtskehrtwendung, a {{maneuver}} that required every unit in the German line to turn 180° simultaneously. As a result of their having fallen behind, the ships of the II Battle Squadron could not conform to the new course following the turn. Hannover and the other five ships of the squadron therefore were located on the disengaged side of the German line. <b>Mauve</b> considered moving his ships {{to the rear of the}} line, astern of the III Battle Squadron dreadnoughts, but decided against it when he realized the movement would interfere with the maneuvering of Admiral Franz von Hipper's battlecruisers. Instead, he attempted to place his ships at the head of the line.|$|E
5|$|The {{body is a}} pale {{brown or}} silvery brown colour, {{transitioning}} to white below, with green, <b>mauve</b> and rosy reflections when the fish is first removed from the water. An indistinct silver-yellow mid-lateral band extends across some specimens. The spinous dorsal fin is olive green with faint darker blotches, the second dorsal fin also a pale olive with rows of dark brown to blackish spots. The anal and ventral fins are pale yellow, the pectorals are pale yellow to pale brown with a well defined dark blue-black blotch at the base. The caudal fin is yellow to olive in colour with darker margins. Juveniles less than 90mm may have darker blotches along their sides and backs.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} and isolation of radium in uranium ore (pitchblende) by Marie Curie sparked {{the development of}} uranium mining to extract the radium, which was used to make glow-in-the-dark paints for clock and aircraft dials. This left a prodigious quantity of uranium as a waste product, since it takes three tonnes of uranium to extract one gram of radium. This waste product was diverted to the glazing industry, making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant. Besides the pottery glazes, uranium tile glazes accounted {{for the bulk of}} the use, including common bathroom and kitchen tiles which can be produced in green, yellow, <b>mauve,</b> black, blue, red and other colors.|$|E

5|$|The time in Arles {{became one}} of Van Gogh's more {{prolific}} periods: he completed 200 paintings, and more than 100 drawings and watercolours. He was enchanted by the local landscape and light; his works from this period are rich in yellow, ultramarine and <b>mauve.</b> His paintings include harvests, wheat fields and general rural landmarks from the area, including The Old Mill (1888), a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields. This was one of seven canvases sent to Pont-Aven on 4 October 1888 in an exchange of works with Paul Gauguin, Émile Bernard, Charles Laval and others.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Longley, the Archbishop of Canterbury, {{married the}} couple on 10 March 1863 at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. The choice of venue was criticised widely. As the {{ceremony}} took place outside London, the press complained that large public crowds {{would not be}} able to view the spectacle. Prospective guests thought it awkward to get to and, as the venue was small, some people who had expected invitations were disappointed. The Danes were dismayed because only Alexandra's closest relations were invited. The British court was still in mourning for Prince Albert, so ladies were restricted to wearing grey, lilac or <b>mauve.</b> As the couple left Windsor for their honeymoon at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, they were cheered by the schoolboys of neighbouring Eton College, including Lord Randolph Churchill.|$|E
5|$|In some of Messiaen's scores, he notated the colours in {{the music}} (notably in Couleurs de la cité céleste and Des canyons aux étoiles...)—the purpose being to aid the {{conductor}} in interpretation rather than to specify which colours the listener should experience. The importance of colour is linked to Messiaen's synaesthesia, which he said caused him to experience colours when he heard or imagined music (he {{said that he did}} not perceive the colours visually). In his multi-volume music theory treatise Traité de rythme, de couleur, et d'ornithologie ("Treatise of Rhythm, Colour and Birdsong"), Messiaen wrote descriptions of the colours of certain chords. His descriptions range from the simple ("gold and brown") to the highly detailed ("blue-violet rocks, speckled with little grey cubes, cobalt blue, deep Prussian blue, highlighted by a bit of violet-purple, gold, red, ruby, and stars of <b>mauve,</b> black and white. Blue-violet is dominant").|$|E

5|$|The {{aspect of}} the {{colouring}} which was most unexpected was Michelangelo's treatment of shadows. The painting of the Libyan Sibyl and the Prophet Daniel, which are side-by-side, are exemplary. On the yellow dress of the Sibyl, Michelangelo has bright yellow highlights, passing through carefully graded tones of deeper yellow to pale orange, darker orange and almost to red in the shadows. While red shadows are of themselves unusual in a fresco, the gradation through adjacent parts of the spectrum is a natural enough solution. On Daniel's robes, {{there is no such}} gentle gradation. The yellow lining of his cloak becomes a sudden dense green in the shadows, while the <b>mauve</b> has shadows that are intensely red. These colour combinations, which are best described as iridescent, can be found at various places on the ceiling, including the hose of the young man in the Mathan lunette which is pale green and reddish purple.|$|E
25|$|He {{returned}} to The Hague and studied further under <b>Mauve.</b> <b>Mauve</b> {{helped him to}} establish a modest studio on the Schenkweg on the outer fringes of The Hague, lending him money to purchase furniture, and {{introduced him to the}} Pulchri Studio, The Hague's most important art society in which he himself played a major role. He also introduced van Gogh to painting, first in oils and then with watercolor.|$|E

6000|$|M. de <b>Mauves</b> sat down, {{and the two}} {{men looked}} at each other across the table, exchanging formal remarks that did little to lend grace to their encounter. Longmore had no reason to suppose the Count knew of his sister's various interventions. He was sure M. de <b>Mauves</b> cared very little about his opinions, and yet he had a sense of {{something}} grim in his own New York face which would have made him change colour if keener suspicion had helped it to be read there. M. de <b>Mauves</b> didn't change colour, but he looked at his wife's so oddly, so more than naturally (wouldn't it be?) detached friend with an intentness that betrayed at once an irritating memory of the episode in the Bois de Boulogne and such vigilant curiosity as was natural to a gentleman who had entrusted his [...] "honour" [...] to another gentleman's magnanimity--or to his artlessness.|$|R
5000|$|The first Cobalts were bred by Mon. Blanchard in 1920, and by George F Hedges in 1923 {{while he}} was the aviary {{attendant}} for Madame Lecallier in France. These were initially called Powder Blues. [...] Some of these latter Cobalts were purchased by Mrs Dalton Burgess and imported to England. [...] She exhibited one (as a Royal Blue) in February 1924 at the Crystal Palace and later that year bred the first <b>Mauves</b> from them. [...] She called the <b>Mauves</b> French Greys in nest feather, and when adult they were known as Lilacs or Lavenders.|$|R

60|$|Three {{days after}} Euphemia's arrival Richard de <b>Mauves,</b> {{coming down from}} Paris to pay his respects to his grandmother, treated our heroine to her first {{encounter}} with a gentilhomme in the flesh. On appearing he kissed his grandmother's hand with a smile which caused her to draw it away with dignity, and set Euphemia, who was standing by, to ask herself {{what could have happened}} between them. Her unanswered wonder was but the beginning of a long chain of puzzlements, but the reader is free to know that the smile of M. de <b>Mauves</b> was a reply to a postscript affixed by the old lady to a letter addressed to him by her granddaughter as soon as the girl had been admitted to justify the latter's promises. Mademoiselle de <b>Mauves</b> brought her letter to her grandmother for approval, but obtained no more than was expressed in a frigid nod. The old lady watched her with this coldness while she proceeded to seal the letter, then suddenly bade her open it again and bring her a pen.|$|R
