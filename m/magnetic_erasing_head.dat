5000|$|The {{pinch roller}} is a rubberized, free-spinning wheel {{typically}} used to press magnetic tape against a capstan shaft {{in order to}} create friction necessary to drive the tape along the <b>magnetic</b> <b>heads</b> (<b>erase,</b> write, read).|$|R
50|$|The flying <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> is {{so-called}} {{because an}} <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> {{is mounted on}} the video head drum and rotates around {{in the same manner}} as the video heads. In the record mode, the <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> is active and erases the video precisely down to the recorded video fields. The flying <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> runs over the tape and the video heads record the signal virtually instantly after the flying <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> has passed.|$|R
50|$|An <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> is {{constructed}} {{in a similar}} manner to a record or replay head, but has a much larger gap, or more frequently, two large gaps. The <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> is powered during recording from a high frequency source (usually the same oscillator that provides the AC bias). In some inexpensive cassette recorder designs, the <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> is a permanent magnet that is mechanically moved into contact with the moving tape only during recording. Permanent magnet <b>erase</b> <b>heads</b> are also sometimes used in machines that are equipped with DC bias.|$|R
50|$|However, {{when trying}} to edit footage deck to deck, {{portions}} of the old recording's video may be between the <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> and video recording heads. This results in a faint rainbow-like noise at and briefly after {{the point of the}} cut as the old video recording missed by the fixed <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> is never completely erased as the new recording is printed.|$|R
50|$|Normally, {{the tape}} is passed {{longitudinally}} through two fixed <b>erase</b> <b>heads,</b> one located just before the tape moves to the video head drum and the other {{right next to the}} audio/control head stack. Upon recording, the <b>erase</b> <b>heads</b> <b>erase</b> any old recording contained on the tape to prevent anything already recorded on it from interfering with what is being recorded.|$|R
5000|$|The tape passes {{across the}} <b>erase</b> <b>head,</b> which wipes any {{existing}} recording from the tape.|$|R
50|$|Since the <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> <b>erases</b> the old signal {{right before}} the video heads write onto the tape, there is no remnant of the old signal to cause visible {{distortion}} at and after the moment a cut is made, resulting in a clean edit. In addition, the ability of flying <b>erase</b> <b>heads</b> to <b>erase</b> old video off the tape right before recording new video on it allows the ability to perform insert editing, where new footage can be placed within an existing recording with clean cuts {{at the beginning and}} end of the edit.|$|R
50|$|The flying <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> is {{a feature}} that {{may be found in}} some high end home VCRs as well as some {{broadcast}} grade VCRs to cleanly edit the video.|$|R
50|$|Erasing {{the data}} tracks without {{destroying}} the servo tracks requires special equipment. The <b>erasing</b> <b>head</b> {{used in these}} erasers has four magnetic poles that match the width {{and the location of}} the data bands.|$|R
50|$|The <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> is fed {{by a high}} level, high {{frequency}} AC signal that overwrites any previous recording on the tape. Without this step, the new recording cannot be guaranteed to completely replace any old recording {{that might have been}} on the tape.|$|R
5000|$|Use of {{separate}} heads for recording vs. playback (three heads total, counting the <b>erase</b> <b>head)</b> enabled {{monitoring of the}} recorded signal {{a fraction of a}} second after recording. Mixing the playback signal back into the record input also created a primitive echo generator.|$|R
5000|$|In later years, an [...] "auto reverse" [...] feature {{appeared}} {{that allowed the}} deck to play (and, in some decks, record) {{on both sides of}} the cassette without the operator having to manually remove, flip, and re-insert the cassette. Most auto-reverse machines use a four channel head (similar to those on multitrack recorders), with only two channels connected to the electronics at one time, one pair for each direction. Auto-reverse decks employ a capstan and pinch roller for each side. Since these use the same opening in the cassette shell normally used for the <b>erase</b> <b>head,</b> such decks must fit the <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> (or two, one for each direction) into the center opening in the shell along with the record/play head.|$|R
40|$|Recorder did {{not possess}} <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> {{nor was it}} capable of {{automatically}} rewinding reel of tape for reuse. Test results show that FM carrier recording signal with sufficient intensity will by itself erase previously recorded data as new data are being recorded. Automatic rewinding was accomplished by adding conventional metal leaders and appropriate circuitry...|$|R
50|$|The term erased is {{most often}} used of an animal's head, when the neck is {{depicted}} with a ragged edge as if forcibly torn from the body. <b>Erased</b> <b>heads</b> are distinct from those couped, in that the former are cut off along a jagged line while the latter are cut off along a straight line.|$|R
50|$|Multi-track {{recording}} {{differs from}} overdubbing and sound on sound because it records separate signals to individual tracks. Sound on sound which Les Paul invented adds a new performance to an existing recording {{by placing a}} second playback head {{in front of the}} <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> to play back the existing track before erasing it and re-recording a new track.|$|R

50|$|Superimposition (SI) during sound {{recording}} and reproduction (commonly called overdubbing) {{is the process}} of adding new sounds over existing without completely erasing or masking the existing sound. Some reel-to-reel tape recorders of the mid 20th century provided crude superimposition facilities that were implemented by killing the high-frequency AC feed to the <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> while recording as normal via the read-write head.|$|R
