The first stimulus was a specific-goal situation whereby each child has {{to create a}} story bAsed {{on any of the}} addition sentences of mixed operational structures. The second stimulus was similar to the first, but involved multiplication. The third required the subjects to pose 2 new problems rather freely based on non-specific-goal situation. A sample of 35 Year 5 pupils were asked to carry out the tasks in a worksheet within an hour. The responses were coded based on a rubric and later analysed quantitavely using descriptive statistics. Six children were selected for further clinical interviews. The children showed preference for the basic <b>Missing</b> <b>End</b> problems for both addition and multiplication sentences.

40|$|Purpose This study, {{conducted}} in five safety‐net practices, including two nurse‐managed health centers (NMHCs) and three federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), examined {{the impact of}} implementing a commercial electronic health records (EHRs) system on medication safety. Data source A mixed methods approach with two sources of data were used: (a) a query of prescription records captured by the EHR retrieving co‐prescribed medications with identified drug–drug interaction (DDI) risks, and (b) semistructured interviews with clinicians and leadership about the usability and benefits of EHR‐embedded clinical decision support {{in the form of}} DDI alerts. Conclusions We found an exceptionally low rate of DDI pairs in all five practices. Only 130 “true” DDI pairs were confirmed representing 149, 087 visits and 62 providers. Among the 130, the largest categories were related to antihypertensive medications, which are in fact often prescribed together. There {{were no significant differences between}} physicians and nurse practitioners on the rate of DDI pairs nor between NMHCs and FQHCs. Implications for practice Implementation of an EHR in these five safety‐net settings had a positive impact on medication safety.

40|$|X-linked cardioskeletal myopathy, {{neutropenia}} and abnormal mitochondria (MIM 302060) (synonyms: Barth syndrome, 3 -methylglutaconic acid-uria type II, endocardial fibroelastosis type 2) {{has been}} reported in patients and families from Europe, North America and Australia. Previous studies characterized the main components of the disease: dilated cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, neutropenia, 3 -methylglutaconic aciduria and diminished statural growth. Respiratory chain impairments have been found in several studies, without pinpointing a single enzyme complex. 3 -Methylglutaconic aciduria is shared with several other disorders that affect the respiratory chain. Previous studies excluded a block in the major pathway of leucine catabolism. We performed leucine loading, accompanied by fasting, in patients and observed a significant rise of 3 -methylglutaconic acid and 3 -methylglutaric acid. Taken together with the absence of an enzymatic block in the major leucine catabolic route, the possibility remains that the increased basal excretion of 3 -methylglutaconic acid and other products of branched-chain amino acids is the result of overload of this pathway or [...] more likely [...] mitochondrial leakage. Linkage studies have localized the gene to the Xq 28 region. The associated tafazzin gene (TAZ), has been fully characterized recently, and mutations located in conserved regions have been reported.

40|$|Background and Purpose-The ASTRAL {{score was}} {{externally}} validated showing remarkable consistency on 3 -month outcome {{prognosis in patients}} with acute ischemic stroke. The present study aimed to evaluate ASTRAL score's prognostic accuracy to predict 5 -year outcome. Methods-All consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke registered in the Athens Stroke Registry between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2010, were included. Patients were excluded if admitted > 24 hours after symptom onset or if any ASTRAL score component was <b>missing.</b> <b>End</b> points were 5 -year unfavorable functional outcome, defined as modified Rankin Scale 3 to 6, and 5 -year mortality. For each outcome, the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was calculated; also, a multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to investigate whether the ASTRAL score was an independent predictor of outcome. The Kaplan-Meier product limit method was used to estimate the probability of 5 -year survival for each ASTRAL score quartile. Results-The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of the score to predict 5 -year unfavorable functional outcome was 0. 89, 95 % confidence interval 0. 88 to 0. 91. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, the ASTRAL score was independently associated with 5 -year unfavorable functional outcome (hazard ratio, 1. 09; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 08 - 1. 10). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for the ASTRAL score's discriminatory power to predict 5 -year mortality was 0. 81 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 78 - 0. 83). In multivariate analysis, the ASTRAL score was independently associated with 5 -year mortality (hazard ratio, 1. 09, 95 % confidence interval, 1. 08 - 1. 10). During the 5 -year follow-up, the probability of survival was significantly lower with increasing ASTRAL score quartiles (log-rank test < 0. 001). Conclusions-The ASTRAL score reliably predicts 5 -year functional outcome and mortality in patients with acute ischemic stroke...|$|E

40|$|There {{are limited}} {{data on the}} {{performance}} of the use of fixed-dose combination (FDC) TB drugs when used under programmatic settings in high TB-endemic countries. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of FDC versus loose formulation (LF) TB treatment regimens for treatment of pulmonary TB (PTB) in the context of actual medical practice in prevailing conditions within programmatic settings in five sites in two high TB-burden African countries. A two-arm, single-blind, randomized clinical trial comparing FDCs with separate LFs involving 1000 adults newly diagnosed with culture positive PTB was conducted at five sites in two African countries between 2007 and 2011. Participants were randomized to receive daily treatment with anti-TB drugs given as either FDC or separate LFs for 24 weeks (intensive phase- 8 weeks of isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide; continuation phase- 16 weeks of rifampicin and isoniazid). Primary outcome measures were microbiological cure and safety at the end of six months' treatment; pre-specified non-inferiority margin for difference in cure rate was 4 %. The primary efficacy analysis was based on the modified intent to treat (mITT) cohort comprising all randomized patients with a positive baseline culture result for TB and who received at least one dose of study treatment. Patients <b>missing</b> <b>end</b> of treatment culture results were considered failures. Further analyses were done in which mITT patients without an end of treatment (EOT) culture were excluded in a complete case analysis (mITTcc) and a per protocol cohort analysis defined as mITTcc patients who received at least 95 % of their intended doses and had an EOT culture result. In the mITT analysis, the cure rate in the FDC group was 86. 7 % (398 / 459) and in the LF group 85. 2 % (396 / 465) (difference 1. 5 -% (90 % confidence interval (CI) (- 2. 2 %- 5. 3 %)). Per Protocol analysis showed similar results: FDC 98. 9 % (359 / 363) versus LF 96. 9 % (345 / 356), (difference 2. 0 % (90 % CI: 0. 1 %- 3. 8 %)). The two arms showed no significant differences in terms of safety, early culture conversion and patient adherence to treatment. The comparison of the two drug regimens satisfied the pre-specified non-inferiority criterion. Our results support the WHO recommendations for the use of FDC in the context of actual medical practice within health services in high TB-endemic countries. ISRCTN Registry 95204603...|$|E
40|$|This is a pre-print of {{an article}} whose final and {{definitive}} form has been published in Acta Neurochirurgica © 2009 Springer; the original publication is available at: [URL] The BrainIT group works collaboratively on developing standards for collection and analyses of data from brain injured patients towards providing a more efficient infrastructure for assessing new health care technology. EC funding supported meetings over a year to discuss and define a core dataset to be collected with IT based methods from patients with traumatic brain injury. We now report {{on the results of}} a follow-up period of funding to test the feasibility for collection of the core dataset with IT based methods. METHODS: Over a three year period, data collection client and web-server based tools were developed and core data (grouped into 9 categories) were collected from 200 head-injured patients by local nursing staff. Data were uploaded by the BrainIT web and random samples of received data were selected automatically by computer for validation by data validation (DV) research nurse staff against gold standard sources held in the local centre. Validated data were compared with original data sent and percentage error rates calculated by data category. Feasibility was assessed in terms of the amount of missing data, accuracy of data collected and limitations reported by users of the IT methods. FINDINGS: Thirteen percent of data files required cleaning. Thirty “one-off” demographic and clinical data elements had significant amounts of missing data (> 15 %). Validation nurses conducted 19, 461 comparisons between uploaded database data with local data sources and error rates were generally {{less than or equal to}} 6 %, the exception being the surgery data class where an unacceptably high error rate was found. Nearly 10, 000 therapies were successfully recorded with start-times but approximately a third had inaccurate or <b>missing</b> <b>end</b> times which limits analyses assessing duration of therapy. Over 40, 000 events and procedures were recorded but events with long durations (such as transfers) were more likely to have “end-times” missed. CONCLUSIONS: The BrainIT core dataset is a rich dataset for hypothesis generation and post-hoc analyses provided studies avoid known limitations in the dataset. Limitations in the current IT based data collection tools have been identified and have been addressed. Future academic led multi-centre data collection projects must decrease validation costs and likely will require more direct electronic access to hospital based clinical data sources for both validation purposes and for reducing the research nurse time needed for double data entry. This type of infrastructure will foster remote monitoring of patient management and protocol adherence in future trials of patient management and monitoring. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|A Fire and Life Safety Analysis of the Bonderson Engineering Projects Center, (BEPC) Building 197 on the California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly) Campus is performed. Both {{prescriptive}} {{and performance}} based methods and metrics are utilized {{to evaluate the}} facility with respect to current fire and building standards and codes. Prescriptive fire protection features and systems analyzed include: building construction type and design, structural fire protection features and requirements, occupancy classification and egress analysis, fire detection, alarm, and communication systems, and fire suppression systems The prescriptive based design requirements largely met the code and installation requirements with the following deficiencies discovered during the analysis: Sprinkler system branch-lines are <b>missing</b> <b>end</b> of line restraints, sprinkler system upright sprinklers are installed too far down from deck in several areas, sprinkler system upright sprinklers are obstructed by mechanical process piping in first floor hallway, fire alarm system horns in Machine Shop and Wood Shop do not produce 15 dBA above ambient conditions (may have AHJ exemption), the single-leaf door for Conference Room 104 does not swing {{in the direction of}} egress travel. A performance-based analysis of (BEPC) is performed. The analysis involves the evaluation of three design fire scenarios pursuant to NFPA 101 Chapter 5; these scenarios are modeled using the computer programs Pyrosim, FDS, and Pathfinder. The tenability results of the computer fire models are compared to established tenability thresholds to determine the available safe egress time (ASET) for each scenario. This time is compared to the required safe egress time (RSET) defined by the Pathfinder software egress model of the building with its full occupant load. The three scenarios considered include: a fire in the entry lobby / atrium by way of a spill of acetonitrile, a fire in an HDPE trash container in the machine shop ignited by hot work, and finally, ignition of two pallets of miscellaneous computer items being stored in the high bay Projects Integration area. Of the three performance-based scenarios tested, only one scenario, the machine shop trash container fire, passed the final RSET vs ASET test with an acceptable factor of safety. BEPC largely meets or exceeds all of the prescriptive requirements for NFPA 101 and the California Building code for egress and structural systems. It also meets requirements and installation codes for fire sprinklers and alarms {{with the exception of the}} deficiencies previously determined. It is recommended that the fire sprinkler deficiencies for end of line restraints, obstructions to spray pattern development and the deflector distances be rectified via retroactive repairs to the systems involved. For fire alarms it is recommended that the AHJ exemption for audible notification in the shops be verified. From a performance based standpoint, the two scenarios that failed the RSET vs ASET could be avoided through the strict application and continued enforcement of a fire safety management plan. Such a plan could reduce both the probability and impact of fires in (BEPC). A proposed plan is included in Appendix A...|$|E
