40|$|In {{animals and}} man, {{molybdenum}} {{has been recognized}} as {{an essential component of}} the enzymes xanthine oxidase, aldehyde oxidase and sulphite oxidase. Nutritional molybdenum deficiencies in animals have been produced in experiments with goats and a molybdenum-poor diet (growth depression, decrease in conception rate, poor foetal survival rate). In practice, the molybdenum supply to animals and humans meets the requirements (animals < 100 μg kg− 1 /feed dry matter, man 25 μg/day). The essentiality of molybdenum and sulphite oxidase in man was documented by more than 100 patients who lacked the enzyme function, either {{as the result of a}} defect in genetic coding, or of a genetic deficiency in the molybdenum cofactor and a molybdenum deficiency during parenteral nutrition. Molybdenum toxicity (<b>molybdenosis)</b> in animals primarily affects ruminants (cattle). It is manifested by diarrhea, anorexia, depigmentation of hair, neurological disturbances and premature death. Molybdenum interacts with copper, and some symptoms of molybdenum toxicity are similar to those of copper deficiency. Only few data are available concerning toxicity to humans. ...|$|E
40|$|Forages that {{accumulate}} excessive molybdenum (Mo) from excessive {{land application}} of Mo can cause <b>molybdenosis,</b> a copper (Cu) induced deficiency in ruminants. Limited {{information is available}} on the effect of land-applied biosolids, Mo content, and quality of winter wheat forage (Triticum aestivum L.). The objectives of this study were (1) to determine the effect of biosolids application on tissue molybdenum and tissue copper (Cu) :Mo of winter wheat forage and, (2) to measure the Mo uptake coefficient value (UC) for winter wheat under field conditions and compare it with the U. S. EPA Part 503 risk-based UC value of 0. 42. Two nitrogen sources, anaerobically digested biosolids and ammonium nitrate, were applied annually from 1993 – 2001 to continuous winter wheat. The experimental design was a complete factorial arrangement of treatments composed of six nitrogen (N) rates (0, 45, 90, 180, 269, and 539 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1) and two N sources (anaerobically-digested biosolids and ammonium nitrate, 34 - 0 - 0). Application of biosolids did not significantly alter soil pH, which ranged from 6. 6 to 7. 2. Biosolids application increased soil Cu from 7. 19 to 19. 6 mg kg- 1 and soil Mo from 0. 44 t...|$|E
40|$|Secondary copper (Cu) deficiency, {{chromium}} (Cr) deficiency and <b>molybdenosis</b> (Mo) {{has been}} suggested to cause the "mysterious" moose disease in the southwest of Sweden. The present experiment was performed on goats to investigate the clinical, chemical, and pathological alterations after 20 months feeding of a semi-synthetic diet deficient in Cu and Cr. Four groups {{were included in the}} study: control group (n = 4), Cu-deficient group (group 1, n = 4), Cr-deficient group (group 2, n = 2) and Cu+Cr-deficient group (group 3, n = 3). Group 3 was additionally supplemented with tetrathiomolybdate during the last 2 months of the experiment. Main histopathological findings in groups 1 and 3 were the lesions in the liver, characterised by a severe active fibrosis, bile duct proliferation, haemosiderosis and mild necroses. Additionally, degenerative alterations of the exocrine pancreas were prominent in groups 1 and 3. Lesions in group 3 were more pronounced than in group 1. In group 3, the skin showed an atrophic dermatosis, while in group 2 a crusty dermatitis caused by Candida spp. was observed. This study shows that liver, pancreas and skin are mainly affected by a long term deficiency of copper and the findings are complicated by molybdenum application while chromium deficiency produced no histomorphological effects in our study. </p...|$|E
40|$|Pollution of {{soil and}} feed on the area of Celje, Jesenice, Mežica and Žirovski Vrh {{represent}} {{an important source of}} intake of contaminants into the bodies of animals and humans. The purpose of study was to assess the level of contamination of the soil and feed with potentially toxic metals and radioactive isotopes. At each site 2 - 7 samples were collected. Sample was analyzed using three different methods: XRF, AAS and VLG, by which elements and radionuclides in maize, grass and soil were determined. In soil from all locations, except Škofja Loka (control location), critical value of at least one potentially toxic metal was exceeded. Even in feed the majority of nutrients exceeds recommended values, or even the maximum permitted levels, which makes it potentially dangerous for cattle. Concentrations of molybdenum and cadmium in feed are so high that the cattle can potentially suffer from <b>molybdenosis</b> or overall decline in capability. Humans are exposed to contaminants via the consumption of beef and milk. Since the calculated values of cadmium in cattle liver and kidney highly exceed the maximum permitted levels, these organs are not suitable for consumption. The specific activity of radionuclides in feed in contaminated areas is significantly higher than in Škofja Loka, therefore greater radiation dose can be expected than the one received by cattle due to the natural radiation in environment. Elevated levels of radionuclides in the feed are also the reason that the calculated specific activity of radionuclides in cow's milk and beef on all collected areas exceed world reference values...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the experiment was to study the response of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L. var. Roma) to the application of molybdenum (Mo) to the soil contained in three kg capacity pots. The experiment consisted of four levels of Mo (i. e. 0, 0. 5, 1. 0 & 2. 0 mg kg- 1 as MoO 3). Basal nutrients were also applied to the pots. Tomato seedlings were raised in a nursery and two seedlings were transplanted in {{to each of the}} pot four weeks after sowing. The shoots and roots were harvested six weeks after transplanting and were oven dried at 65 o C, weighed, ground and analyzed for N, P, K and Mo contents. Increasing levels of Mo did not significantly (P< 0. 05) affect the dry matter yields and percentage N, P and K concentrations of tomato plant. It however significantly increased the Mo concentration and uptake by tomato plant. The results showed that application of 0. 5 to 1. 0 mg kg- 1 Mo to tomato plant improved the dry matter yields and nutrient concentration in the plant. Highest shoot and root dry matter yields were obtained at 0. 5 mg kg- 1 Mo level, which were about 19. 35 and 37. 65 %, respectively above the control. Highest Mo concentration (2. 13 µg g- 1) and uptake (8. 19 µg pot- 1) were observed at the 2 mg kg- 1 Mo level. The Mo concentration at this level was far below the threshold of 10 mg kg- 1 for causing <b>molybdenosis...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{possible}} {{effects of}} the application of swine manure and biosolids to high phosphorus (P) test soils has been widely debated due to the potential increase in P pollution. The application of these materials to soils might result in changes in water, soil, and crop quality. Increasing P in an already high soil P test (STP) soil may result in changing P dynamics in agro-ecosystems and enhancing P movement away from sorption sites. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effect of swine manure (SM), biosolid (BS) and triple superphosphate (TSP) applications on the soil P content in a Webster soil. An incubation study and a field study were conducted where BS, SM and TSP were applied at three rates to a high STP soil. Soybeans and corn were planted in the field experiment. Soil, plant, and grain samples were analyzed for P and Mo. The application of BS, SM, and TSP to a high STP soil resulted in an increase of soil P. This increase of soil P resulted in different response to plant Mo accumulation. A high soil P did not cause an increase of either grain or whole plant Mo uptake in corn. However, increasing P application rate increased P and Mo concentration in soybean whole plant and grain. The results of this study suggest that the fate of P and Mo after 2 years of application of BS and SM is an accumulation in the soil plant system. Accumulations of P in already high STP soils may lead to potential movement of P off-site. This P movement out of sorption sites may contribute to the already high P surplus in the ecosystem. Accumulations of Mo in the soil and subsequently in soybean may increase the potential for <b>molybdenosis</b> in livestock that use soybean as main source of protein...|$|E
40|$|As part of {{a series}} of geoenvironmental studies on the {{mobilization}} and fate of selenium (Se) and other potentially toxic trace elements in southeast Idaho phosphate mining areas, trace element concentrations (mg kg 1 dry mass) in plant samples collected along transects at the Wooley Valley Unit 1, 3, and 4 waste-rock dumps were compared with samples collected from undisturbed sites at Dairy Syncline, Deer Creek, Dry Valley, Maybe Canyon, and Rasmussen Ridge. Additionally, trace-element concentrations in veg- etation samples collected from wetlands associated with mine waste-rock piles were compared with samples collected from a single reference wetland. In undisturbed areas, Se in vegetation growing in soils overlying and derived from Phosphoria Formation phosphatic rocks tended to be higher than vegetation in undisturbed Wells Limestone or Rex Chert soils. Vegetation growing in highly disturbed soils, such as those comprising waste-rock dumps, had the highest tissue Se. Vegetation in a wetland at the base of Wooley Valley Unit 4 waste-rock dump accumulated decreasing concentrations of Se with increasing distance away from the waste-rock dump along the wetland flow path. Iron oxides were observed coating wetland sediment surfaces and helped control Se bioavailability. Plant uptake, as well as coprecipitation and sorption of Se by iron oxides, were key processes in the natural attenuation of Se in this wetland. Legumes at the rock dumps contained higher Se (mean = 80 mg kg- 1) than trees (mean = 52 mgkg 1), grasses (mean = 18 mgkg 1), shrubs (mean = 6 mgkg 1), and forbs (mean = 3 mg kg- 1). However, grasses were among the highest Se accumulators among plant lifeforms in contaminated wetlands, with a mean value of 53 mg kg 1 Se. In most places, uptake of Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, and Zn was below critical high levels for plants. However, Se, Cd, Cr, and Zn uptake by some plants may have been large enough to affect their growth. Several plant lifeforms had Se concentrations that surpassed the acute and chronic toxicity thresholds for grazing livestock and wildlife, posing a lethal risk to these animals. Forages, particularly legumes, sampled from waste-rock dumps had increased Mo concentrations, resulting in Cu/Mo ratios below 1. High Mo (above 10 mg kg 1) and Cu/Mo ratios below 2 may cause <b>molybdenosis</b> in ruminants. There were instances where tree Zn content exceeded upper chronic intake for livestock/wildlife. This may pose some concern for browsing animals feeding upon trees, particularly in winter months. Based on the vegetation survey, possible remediation strategies via physical, chemical, and biologi- cal manipulations of the contaminated sites include removal of the most contaminated soils, capping contaminated soils and revegetating capping materials, application of selec- tive herbicides to remove legumes from reclaimed waste-rock dumps, and fencing some contaminated areas to better manage grazing...|$|E
