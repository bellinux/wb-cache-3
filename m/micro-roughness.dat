40|$|A {{technique}} {{is being developed}} to fabricate a prototype lightweight composite mirror one meter in diameter. The mandrel, on which the composite mirror will be laid up, is an ultra low expansion quartz glass, TSG, whose thermal expansion coefficient, 10 (exp - 7) / degC or less, {{is similar to that}} for the composite material itself. The mandrel surface will be super-polished to 6 - 8 A rms or better, resulting in ten times less scattered light in the visible region than is found in typical astronomical mirrors. We have shown experimentally that mandrel <b>micro-roughnesses</b> of this order can be successfully replicated on composite faceplates. The faceplate is very tough, and does not fracture like a thin glass faceplate. It will be supported by actuators alone, not by the edge of the mirror mount, to avoid non-uniform or non-symmetric influence functions. BOR developed actuators are designed for atmospheric correction, maintenance of optical figure, and minor tip tilt. They have a throw of a centimeter, can be controlled remotely, and have a response time of 1 / 2 msec. The piezoelectric part of the actuator operates in the 30 - 70 V range and the differential screw portion has a linearity of about +/- 0. 1 microns...|$|R
5000|$|The {{first step}} of {{analysis}} is to filter the raw data to remove very high frequency data (called [...] "micro-roughness") since it can often be attributed to vibrations or debris on the surface. Filtering out the <b>micro-roughness</b> at a given cut-off threshold also allows to bring closer the roughness assessment made using profilometers having different stylus ball radius e.g. 2 µm and 5 µm radii. Next, the data is separated into roughness, waviness and form. This can be accomplished using reference lines, envelope methods, digital filters, fractals or other techniques. Finally, the data is summarized using one or more roughness parameters, or a graph. In the past, surface finish was usually analyzed by hand. The roughness trace would be plotted on graph paper, and an experienced machinist decided what data to ignore and where to place the mean line. Today, the measured data is stored on a computer, and analyzed using methods from signal analysis and statistics.|$|E

The degree of H- and Cl-termination on the growing surface determined the degree of <b>micro-roughness</b> at the p-type a-Si:H:Cl/intrinsic a-Si:H:Cl interface and solar cell performance. A higher degree of Cl-termination compared to H-termination was effective to suppress the <b>micro-roughness</b> at the growing surface and oxygen incorporation into the film, as well as chemical reduction of the intrinsic a-Si:H:Cl layer during the underneath p-layer formation.

40|$|During tennis-specific movements, such as {{accelerating}} {{and side}} stepping, the dynamic traction {{provided by the}} shoe-surface combination {{plays an important role}} in the injury risk and performance of the player. Acrylic hard court tennis surfaces have been reported to have increased injury occurrence, partly caused by increased traction that developed at the shoe-surface interface. Often mechanical test methods used for the testing and categorisation of playing surfaces do not tend to simulate loads occurring during participation on the surface, and thus are unlikely to predict the human response to the surface. A traction testing device, discussed in this paper, has been used to mechanically measure the dynamic traction force between the shoe and the surface under a range of normal loading conditions that are relevant to real-life play. Acrylic hard court tennis surfaces generally have a rough surface topography, due to their sand and acrylic paint mixed top coating. Surface <b>micro-roughness</b> will influence the friction mechanisms present during viscoelastic contacts, as found in footwear-surface interactions.

In this paper, the collisions of ballistic particles interacting with an irregular surface modeled by a quadratic Koch curve, are studied numerically. The q moments of the source spatial distribution of collision numbers μ(x) are characterized by a sequence of "collision exponent" τ(q). The measure μ(x) {{is found to be}} multifractal even when a random <b>micro-roughness</b> (or random re-emission) of the surface exists. The dimensions f(α), obtained by a Legendre transformation from τ(q), consist of two parabolas corresponding to a trinomial multifractal. This is demonstrated for a particular case by obtaining an exact f(α) for a multiplicative trinomial mass distribution. The trinomial nature of the multifractality is related to the type of surface macro-irregularity considered here and is independent of the <b>micro-roughness</b> of the surface which however influence the values of α_min and α_max. The information dimension D_I increases significantly with the <b>micro-roughness</b> of the surface. Interestingly, in contrast with this point of view, the surface seems to work uniformly.

30|$|Vacuumization {{processes}} {{not only}} add to friction force but also increase wear, because produced suction forces along with contact of the naked surface make easier to damage sliding surfaces. In our opinion, wear of sliding contact could be greatly reduced by searching some methods to reduce friction force. These methods may include formation of <b>micro-roughness</b> of special shape on the surface. Similar approach was successfully used in [7] to reduce friction force in point-contact friction system. Though we use linear contact which differs significantly in properties, specially formed surface {{can also be}} used to reduce friction and wear. According to our compressive-vacuum hypothesis of friction, this can be done by preventing vacuumization. This idea is supported by the experimental data obtained during the friction testing of steel surfaces with specially designed <b>micro-roughness</b> [8, 9].|$|E

Experimental results showed that spangle displays an increasing electrochemically active trend from shiny, feathery to dull spangle, which is attributed to the combined factors of surface <b>micro-roughness,</b> surface texture, and surface segregation of spangle. In addition, the Sb 3 Zn 4 particles precipitated on the coating surface {{play an important role in}} the corrosion resistance of spangle.

40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{techniques}} for estimating the amount of weathering a clast has undergone. These usually have the objective of establishing an ordinal chronology of geomorphological surfaces, or investigation of site-specific conditions affecting weathering rates. Three such techniques are applied to a dated sequence of alluvial fan segments in southern Tunisia. Two of these techniques depend on measuring surface roughness (the <b>micro-roughness</b> meter and a displacement approach) and one uses the structural weakening of the rock fabric (Schmidt hammer). The <b>micro-roughness</b> meter enables calculation of standard deviation of surface height variation, root mean square roughness and surface autocorrelation function.

As the surface specifications for precision optics become more demanding, the metrology instruments must cover a broad spatial frequency range. Generally, multiple instruments are used to cover {{the full range of}} the specifications. For example, a Fizeau interferometer would be used to test low spatial frequency surface errors, a white light interferometer would be used for mid spatial frequency errors, and an AFM would be used for high spatial frequency errors.

However, in many applications, an increase in the spatial resolution of a metrology instrument could negate the need for multiple instruments. A solution to increase the spatial resolution of <b>micro-roughness</b> measurements obtained using white light interferometry with "interlaced stitching" will be presented.
