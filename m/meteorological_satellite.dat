500|$|The Cooperative Institute for <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Satellite</b> Studies (CIMSS) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison has {{developed}} the Objective Dvorak Technique (ODT).

This is generally not implemented for tropical depressions or weak tropical storms. [...] The China Meteorological Agency (CMA) is expected to start using the standard 1984 version of Dvorak in the near future. [...] The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) prefers using visible satellite imagery over infrared imagery due to a perceived high bias in estimates derived from infrared imagery during the early morning hours of convective maximum. [...] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) uses the infrared version of Dvorak over the visible imagery version. [...] Hong Kong Observatory and JMA continue to utilize Dvorak after tropical cyclone landfall. [...] Various centers hold on to the maximum current intensity for 6–12 hours, though this rule is broken when rapid weakening is obvious.|$|E
500|$|The {{origins of}} Cyclone Winifred {{can be traced}} to a {{tropical}} low first noted approximately [...] north of Cairns, Queensland on 27January 1986. The system initially drifted to the northwest, exhibiting characteristics indicating gradual organization. On the morning of 29January, it curved southward while slowly strengthening. Observations gathered by the Geostationary <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Satellite</b> (GMS) on 30January evidenced that the low had developed into a tropical cyclone while maintaining a minimum atmospheric pressure of 995mbar (29.38inHg). As a result, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) subsequently designated the disturbance the name Winifred at 1400UTC as it meandered southward, the sixth named storm of the 1985–86 Australian region cyclone season. The cyclone continued to steadily intensify, attaining Category1-equivalent intensity on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale during the morning of 1February, with winds of [...] Forecasting of Winifred's track was impeded by the presence of a canopy of persistent high-level cirrus clouds shielding the eye and rainbands of the cyclone throughout its course, leading to inaccuracies in locating the cyclone's centre through satellite observations.|$|E

500|$|In January 1960, {{a formal}} naming scheme was {{introduced}} for the South-West Indian Ocean by the Mauritius and Madagascan Weather Services. {{with the first}} cyclone being named Alix. Later that year, as meteorology entered a new era with the launching of the world's first <b>meteorological</b> <b>satellite</b> TIROS-1, eight lists of tropical cyclone names were prepared {{for use in the}} Atlantic and Eastern Pacific basins. In the Atlantic it was decided to rotate these lists every four years, while in the Eastern Pacific the names were designed to be used consecutively before being repeated. During 1963, the Philippine Weather Bureau adopted four sets of female Filipino nicknames ending in [...] "ng" [...] from A to Y for use in its self-defined area of responsibility. Following the international practise of naming tropical cyclones, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology decided at a conference in October 1963 that they would start naming tropical cyclones after women {{at the start of the}} 1963–64 cyclone season. The first Western Australian cyclone was subsequently named Bessie on January 6, 1964. In 1965, after two of the Eastern Pacific lists of names had been used, it was decided to start recycling the sets of names on an annual basis like in the Atlantic.|$|E
500|$|A {{polar low}} is a small-scale, {{short-lived}} atmospheric low-pressure system (depression) that is found {{over the ocean}} areas poleward of the main polar front in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Polar lows are cold-core {{so they can be}} considered as a subset of extratropical cyclones. Polar lows were first identified on the <b>meteorological</b> <b>satellite</b> imagery that became available in the 1960s, which revealed many small-scale cloud vortices at high latitudes. The most active polar lows are found over certain ice-free maritime areas in or near the Arctic during the winter, such as the Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea, Labrador Sea and Gulf of Alaska. Polar lows dissipate rapidly when they make landfall. Antarctic systems tend to be weaker than their northern counterparts since the air-sea temperature differences around the continent are generally smaller [...] However, vigorous polar lows can be found over the Southern Ocean. During winter, when cold-core lows with temperatures in the mid-levels of the troposphere reach [...] move over open waters, deep convection forms, which allows polar low development to become possible. The systems usually have a horizontal length scale of less than [...] and exist for no {{more than a couple of}} days. They are part of the larger class of mesoscale weather systems. Polar lows can be difficult to detect using conventional weather reports and are a hazard to high-latitude operations, such as shipping and gas and oil platforms. Polar lows have been referred to by many other terms, such as polar mesoscale vortex, Arctic hurricane, Arctic low, and cold air depression. Today the term is usually reserved for the more vigorous systems that have near-surface winds of at least 17m/s.|$|E
