The important factor {{here is that}} in all those four cases, <b>multiplication</b> <b>task</b> <b>is</b> involved, {{which is the only}} mental arithmetic task among five different tasks considered in this experiment. It is expected that being an arithmetic task, multiplication involves more complexity in comparison with other four mental tasks, namely geometrical figure rotation, letter composing, counting and baseline-resting. As a result, characteristics of the EEG signals are expected to be significantly different in case of multiplication task and thus better classification performance is achieved whenever one of the two tasks to be classified is a multiplication task.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Current {{models of}} brain {{function}} propose that number processing involves {{the interaction of}} different neuronal networks. Our purpose was to use functional MR (fMR) imaging to elucidate the brain regions engaged by multiplication. METHODS: Eighteen adults underwent fMR imaging while performing matching, multipli-cation, and control tasks. For each task, three or four single-digit or low-value double-digit numbers were presented serially followed by a 12 -second delay. A target stimulus then ap-peared and subjects made a judgement by pressing a button box that recorded responses. During the matching task, subjects judged whether the target stimulus matched one of the previous numbers. During the <b>multiplication</b> <b>task,</b> subjects judged whether the target stimulus {{was the product of}} the previous numbers. For the control <b>task,</b> the numbers <b>were</b> always zeros, and the subjects responded to a target stimulus that was always four zeros. Composite statistical parametric maps of the time course of activation comparing the control task with the matching and <b>multiplication</b> <b>tasks,</b> respectively, <b>were</b> generated and the significance of signal changes was estimated by randomization of statistical parametric maps.

40|$|Neuroimaging techniques, such as {{functional}} Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), {{have allowed}} researchers to investigate active neuronal structures {{in relation to}} cognitive theories using a non-invasive technique. Although most experiments in neuropsychology require participants to perform tasks in an upright position, fMRI requires participants to perform cognitive tests while recumbent and motionless inside a narrow bore. The psychological and physical stressors introduce, such as loud noises, head restraints and a supine position, can alter brain hydrostatics and influence cognitive processing. The current study investigates {{the effects of the}} entire fMRI environment and the supine position on cognitive function. 32 participants completed a problem-solving, two-digit-by-two-digit <b>multiplication</b> <b>task</b> in two settings, a standard setting (a silent standard laboratory cubicle) and a non-standard setting (either the fMRI simulator or the supine position) and mean response times and accuracy between settings were compared. Results indicated that healthy young adults showed no difference in either response time or accuracy performance in the non-standard setting compared to the laboratory. It was found that there was no significant interaction between the groups and settings, no difference between the groups and no effects of the setting.

30|$|In EEG signal analysis, {{depending}} {{on the nature of}} practical applications, different well-defined narrow frequency bands, namely delta (< 4  Hz), theta (4 – 7  Hz), alpha (8 – 13  Hz), beta (14 – 20  Hz), and gamma (24 – 37  Hz) are widely investigated for feature extraction [5]. However, in the current application of mental task classification, it may not be useful to restrict the EEG signal analysis only to these low frequency bands. The reason behind is explained as follows. It is well known that while performing mental tasks, relatively high frequency bands (e.g. beta bands or even higher) remain active. Considering this fact in [5], for the purpose of mental task classification, frequency band up to 37 Hz and in [6], frequency band up to 100 Hz are used. In view of investigating the presence of high frequency components in EEG signal during mental tasks, spectral analysis on a large number of EEG frames taken from different channels is carried out. In Fig.  1, average values of magnitude spectra along with standard deviations, computed from 19 consecutive overlapping frames of EEG signal obtained from subject 1 considering mathematical <b>multiplication</b> <b>task,</b> <b>are</b> plotted. As mentioned before, these frames correspond to one complete session within which the mental <b>task</b> <b>is</b> performed. It is clearly observed from this figure that substantial amount of spectral information exists in high frequency region (> 40 Hz) of the averaged magnitude spectra. It is found that the patterns of the averaged spectrum obtained in different other sessions exhibit quite similar nature. As a result, in the proposed method, the whole frequency band of EEG signal is utilized in order to extract spectral information residing in higher frequency region. It is to be mentioned that in order to remove 60 Hz artifact, at the beginning, a digital notch filter is used and raw EEG signals are normalized to zero mean and unit variance. In the result section, effect of considering band-limited EEG signals with different band widths on mental <b>task</b> classification <b>is</b> presented.|$|R

In Experiment 1, French-speaking participants were asked first to retrieve the product of two numbers presented in Arabic or verbal code, and then to perform a number-matching task on the same material to assess the encoding time difference between numerals in the two formats. Experiment 2 involved the same <b>multiplication</b> <b>task</b> with Dutch-speaking participants who name two-diet numbers in reverse order. The format effects obtained by Campbell and Clark (1992); Campbell (1994) for multiplication were replicated. However, several observations suggest that some of these effects may be due to encoding time differences between word and digit numerals. The same size-by-format interaction was found for the number-matching task as for the <b>multiplication</b> <b>task,</b> and the effect disappeared with practice in the <b>multiplication</b> <b>task.</b> Finally, {{despite the fact that the}} linguistic structure of number names differs between French and Dutch, the types of error produced in both groups were identical.

40|$|Brain {{operates}} {{on a network}} level. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides structural and functional images noninvasively with large field of view and at high spatial resolution and thus assumes an extremely valuable role in studying brain networks. The objectives of this doctoral work were to develop and apply novel MRI methods on human and rodent brains, for in vivo and global assessments of functional brain networks at resting and task-evoked states. Firstly, the feasibility of passband balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) imaging for distortion-free and high-resolution resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) was investigated. Resting-state networks (RSNs) derived from bSSFP images were shown spatially and spectrally comparable to those derived from conventional gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (GE-EPI) with considerable intra- and inter-subject reproducibility. High-resolution bSSFP corresponded well to the anatomical images, with RSNs exquisitely co-localized to gray matter. Furthermore, RSNs at areas of severe susceptibility were proved accessible including human anterior prefrontal cortex and rat piriform cortex. These findings demonstrated {{for the first time}} that passband bSSFP approach can be a promising alternative to GE-EPI for rsfMRI. It offers distortion-free and high-resolution RSNs and is potentially suited for high field studies. Secondly, to examine the macrovascular contributions to the spatial and spectral prosperities of resting-state networks, spin-echo echo-planar imaging (SE-EPI) with moderate diffusion weighting (DW) was proposed for rsfMRI. SE and DW suppressed the extravascular and intravascular contributions from macrovessels respectively. Significantly lower functional connectivity strength was observed in the posterior cingulate cortex of the default mode network derived from DW SE-EPI data comparing to that derived from SE-EPI, suggesting a confounding role played by the intravascular component from large veins, whereas no significant spectral difference was detected. Therefore, the DW SEEPI approach for rsfMRI may assist in better identifying and interpreting largescale brain networks with future improvement in temporal resolution by acceleration techniques and in sensitivity at higher field. Thirdly, rsfMRI was performed to evaluate the intrinsic functional networks in the corresponding anatomical visual brain connections traced by Mn-enhanced MRI (MEMRI). Strengths of resting-state functional connectivity appeared to couple with structural connectivity in MEMRI, demonstrating the sensitivity of these structural and functional connectivity MRI techniques for assessing the neuroarchitecture, neurophysiology and structural-functional relationships in the visual brain in vivo. Fourthly, the hypothesis that a regional activation identified via general linear model analysis of fMRI data reflects the summation of multiple distinct networks that carry different functional purposes was tested. Overlapping frontoparietal networks engaged in a simple single-digit <b>multiplication</b> <b>task</b> <b>were</b> found and their functional roles were evaluated through independent components analysis and contributive source analysis. Future studies incorporating different arithmetic tasks and resting state will shed more light upon how brain accomplishes arithmetic and more complex tasks in general. Lastly, benefiting from higher SNR, better spatial and temporal resolution at higher field, exploratory fMRI studies were conducted on rats at 7 T for in vivo assessments of 1) the effect of dark-rearing on postnatal visual development, 2) sound amplitude modulations and 3) sound frequency modulation sweep direction selectivity in auditory system.

Over the last decade, surgical electrostimulation was used to identify and preserve the cortical areas involved in such processing. Conversely, subcortical connectivity among different areas implicated in this function remains unclear, {{and the role of}} surgery in this domain has not been explored so far. The authors present the first 2 cases in which the subcortical functional sites involved in calculation were identified during right parietal lobe surgery. Two patients affected by a glioma located in the right parietal lobe underwent surgery with the aid of MRI neuronavigation. No calculation deficits were detected during preoperative assessment. Cortical and subcortical mapping were performed using a bipolar stimulator. The current intensity was determined by progressively increasing the amplitude by 0. 5 -mA increments (from a baseline of 1 mA) until a sensorimotor response was elicited. Then, addition and <b>multiplication</b> calculation <b>tasks</b> <b>were</b> administered. Corticectomy was performed according to both the MRI neuronavigation data and the functional findings obtained through cortical mapping. Direct subcortical electrostimulation was repeatedly performed during tumor resection. Subcortical functional sites for multiplication and addition were detected in both patients. Electrostimulation interfered with calculation processing during cortical mapping as well. Functional sites were spared during tumor removal. The postoperative course was uneventful, and calculation processing was preserved. Postoperative MRI showed complete resection of the tumor. The present preliminary study shows for the first time how functional mapping can be a promising method to intraoperatively identify the subcortical functional sites involved in calculation processing.
