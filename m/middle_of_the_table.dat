25|$|The {{player in}} the first seat sitting {{to the left of}} the dealer leads to the first trick. The other two follow in {{clockwise}} direction. Every player plays one card to the trick, which is in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> The winner of a trick stacks the cards face-down in front of him and leads to the next trick, which is again played clockwise.|$|E
25|$|After World War II, City {{continued}} {{to play in the}} Third Division South. At first, City settled as a mid-table team, however, in the last seven years before the league reformation, City began to drift away from the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> finishing in the top 10 in 1953–54 (ninth), in the bottom four in 1951–52 (23rd), 1954–55 (22nd) and 1956–57 (21st), and bottom in 1957–58. Due to a re-organisation of the leagues in 1958, City found themselves in the newly formed Fourth Division ahead of the new season.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of each round each player is dealt ten cards, with the two remaining cards (the so-called Skat) being put face down in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> Dealing follows this pattern: deal three cards each, then deal the Skat, then four cards each, then three cards again (“three–Skat–four–three”). In four-player rounds, the dealer does not receive any cards and skips actual play of the round. He or she may peek into the hand of one other player (if allowed to do so) but never into the Skat.|$|E
50|$|Since {{their second}} {{promotion}} {{to the top}} tier, the club has remained in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> league <b>table,</b> and has often included some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country's most well known players.|$|R

25|$|Then, in 2014, the Balearic club {{announced}} Miquel Soler as {{the coach}} {{at the beginning of}} the summer, only for new GM Dudu Aouate to remove Soler and bring in the Russian, Valeri Karpin. Under a Board led by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer, the Karpin-coached 2014-15 team struggled through to winter, and goalkeeper Dudu Aouate was dismissed. Then, after five consecutive victories, the Bermellone club catapulted up into the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> when Lorenzo Serra Ferrer sold his shares to German Utz Claassen, who then became the majority shareholder. As that shareholder, Claassen replaced Karpin with Miquel Soler, yet the team still struggled through the season and again had to salvage the season at the very end.|$|E
25|$|After {{winning in}} two matches against the Irish, and one against England {{in the winter}} of 1999 at home, the Wallabies ended up {{finishing}} in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> for the 1999 Tri Nations Series (with Gregan having played in every match), though they were still favourable entering the 1999 World Cup held in Wales. Australia finished at the top of Pool E, winning all their games, with Gregan playing in the matches against Romania and Ireland, though he was rested in the final pool game against the USA. The Wallabies went on to defeat hosts Wales in the quarter finals at the new Millennium Stadium with Gregan scoring a try, putting Joe Roff into space and then taking the scoring pass, and enter the final after defeating defending champions South Africa in the semi-finals. The Wallabies became two-time World Champions after defeating France 35 to 12 in the final.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the same publication, Ne-Yo explained how he wrote the lyrics, [...] "I'm listening to the track, and all I can see is Rihanna and some random person sitting across from each other at the table with a gun sitting in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and playing Russian roulette." [...] Ne-Yo further stated that Rihanna is not afraid to trying new things and from the first moment she heard the song he knew she would like it, [...] "I trust Rihanna to be Rihanna, and she trusts me to be me. That's the coolest thing about our relationship. I must say this song is a step in somewhat of a different direction for both of us." [...] When Harmony heard the song, both he and Ne-Yo were aware that they should change some elements and {{that it had to be}} darker and edgier.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Smokin'" [...] was {{directed}} by Peter Gray and also appears on the DVD version of Songbook: The Singles, Vol. 1. The video begins with {{a shot of the}} Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appears {{on the cover of the}} Ice Hockey Hair EP. The logo fades out and the camera pans through a crowd of dark figures wearing berets towards a woman standing behind a long, black table. The woman is wearing a short sleeved black dress and has a blonde bob haircut. Her arms and face are illuminated in the otherwise dark room and she is shown walking backwards down the table, giving coloured cards to each of the figures wearing berets. The woman walks up and down the table observing the crowd as they each use the piece of card they were given to make an origami animal. As each person completes a model animal the woman gives them a new piece of coloured card. Approximately two minutes into the video the woman returns to a central position behind the table and looks down at one of the beret wearers. The camera cuts to show him screwing up a piece of green card into a ball which turns into an origami crane and flies away as he opens his hands. The rest of the figures in berets are shown from behind, bowing their heads before the camera cuts to a close up view of several origami animals on the table. These animals also begin to move, and interact with each other until a large red animal arrives. The camera cuts to a close-up of the red animal's head with smoke shown coming from its nose. The next shot shows the origami animals stationary on the table as the camera pans up to the beret wearers who are looking straight ahead while smoke moves across from the right. The woman walks up and down the table giving the beret wearers new pieces of card as they complete more and more origami animals. As the video draws to an end she rapidly piles up the origami animals into a heap in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> When all the animals have been collected into the pile the beret wearers bow their heads and the woman puts her arms around the pile and smiles at the camera. In the final shot the woman places her hands on the table and stares at the camera as the video fades out to show the same Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appeared at the very beginning.|$|E
2500|$|Although Thompson and East proved {{themselves}} to be bowlers of high class, a weak batting line-up meant that the team remained close {{to the bottom of}} the championship table until Sydney Smith arrived in 1909. After three years in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> Northants surprisingly improved to finish second in 1912 and fourth in 1913. Thompson, Smith and William [...] "Bumper" [...] Wells formed one of the strongest attacks in county cricket at the time, whilst Smith and Haywood were the county's best batsmen.|$|E

5000|$|In Hawaii, a {{calabash}} is a {{large serving}} bowl, usually made from a hardwood {{rather than from the}} calabash gourd as in Maroon cultures. It is used on a buffet <b>table</b> or in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dining <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> calabash in Hawaii has led to terms like [...] "calabash family" [...] or [...] "calabash cousins", indicating an extended family grown up around shared meals and close friendships.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Pong <b>Table</b> sits 33 {{inches off}} the ground and the surface area is exactly 9'x5'. Because <b>the</b> Pong <b>Table</b> is a close sibling to <b>the</b> ping pong <b>table,</b> two hinges for a net should be {{fastened}} at <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> Additionally, a flattened ping pong net should lie between and connected to the hinges. While Pong can be played with actual ping pong paddles, the more traditional and acceptable way to play involves paddles which use sandpaper-like material as padding and have the handles broken off.|$|R
6000|$|The prudent Davidson sought {{shelter in}} the nearest darkened room.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{buildings}} {{on both the}} north and <b>the</b> south side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Military Demarcation Line (MDL), {{and there have been}} some built on top <b>of</b> it. <b>The</b> JSA is the location where all negotiations since 1953 have been held, including statements of Korean solidarity, which have generally amounted to little except a slight decline <b>of</b> tensions. <b>The</b> MDL goes through the conference rooms and down <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conference <b>tables</b> where <b>the</b> North Koreans and the United Nations Command (primarily South Koreans and Americans) meet face to face.|$|R
50|$|Around the {{elements}} in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> periodic <b>table,</b> isotopes that are lighter than stable isotopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same element tend to decay through electron capture, while isotopes heavier than the stable ones decay by electron emission.

When <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> mass in a nuclear reaction is greater than zero but less than 2m0-1e-, the process cannot occur by positron emission but is spontaneous for electron capture.|$|R

60|$|Numbers {{of bottles}} were ranged down <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables,</b> which were <b>of</b> bare wood without cloth. These contained, as Petroff told him, wines from {{various parts of}} Russia. There were wines similar to sherry and Bordeaux, from the Crimea; Kahetinskoe, {{strongly}} resembling good burgundy, from the Caucasus; and Don Skoe, a sparkling wine resembling champagne, from the Don. Besides these were tankards of Iablochin Kavas, or cider; Grushevoi Kavas, or perry; Malovinoi, a drink prepared from raspberries; and Lompopo, a favourite drink on <b>the</b> shores <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Baltic. The conversation naturally turned on student topics, of tricks played on professors, on past festivities, amusements, and quarrels. No allusion of any kind was made to politics, or to <b>the</b> matters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day. Jovial songs were sung, the whole joining in chorus with great animation. At nine o'clock waiters appeared with trays containing <b>the</b> indispensable beginning <b>of</b> all Russian feasts. Each tray contained {{a large number of}} small dishes with fresh caviar, raw herrings, smoked salmon, dried sturgeon, slices of German sausage, smoked goose, ham, radishes, cheese, and butter. From these the guests helped themselves at will, the servants handing round small glasses of Kümmel Liftofka, a spirit flavoured with <b>the</b> leaves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> black-currant, and vodka.|$|R
