40|$|Achieving single species maximum {{sustainable}} yield (MSY) {{in complex}} and dynamic fisheries targeting multiple species (<b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries)</b> is challenging because achieving the objective for one species may mean missing the objective for another. The North Sea <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> are a representative example of {{an issue that is}} generic across most demersal fisheries worldwide, with the diversity of species and fisheries inducing numerous biological and technical interactions. Building on a rich knowledge base for the understanding and quantification of these interactions, new approaches have emerged. Recent paths towards operationalizing MSY at the regional scale have suggested the expansion of the concept into a desirable area of "pretty good yield", implemented through a range around FMSY that would allow for more flexibility in management targets. This article investigates the potential of FMSY ranges to combine long-term single-stock targets with flexible, short-term, mixed-fisheries management requirements applied to the main North Sea demersal stocks. It is shown that sustained fishing at the upper bound of the range may lead to unacceptable risks when technical interactions occur. An objective method is suggested that provides an optimal set of fishing mortality within the range, minimizing the risk of total allowable catch mismatches among stocks captured within <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries,</b> and addressing explicitly the trade-offs between the most and least productive stocks...|$|R

40|$|The ICES’ Working Group on <b>Mixed</b> <b>Fisheries</b> Advice for the North Sea [WGMIXFISH-NS] (Chair: Steven Holmes (UK)) met at ICES HQ, 20 - 24 May 2013 {{to apply}} <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> {{forecasts}} {{to the draft}} North Sea single species advice formed by WGNSSK 2013. The meeting has produced a North Sea <b>Mixed</b> <b>Fisheries</b> Advice sheet and included lines showing <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> scenario outcomes in the single species advice sheets (for those stocks considered) for consideration by the ACOM advice drafting group. The North Sea <b>Mixed</b> <b>Fisheries</b> Annex is a separate document with minor updates from last year. The <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> runs followed the approach used by ICES; management plan where it exists and MSY approach otherwise. The species considered here {{as part of the}} demersal <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> of the North Sea are cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole, and Nephrops norvegicus. The plaiceVIId and soleVIId stocks were added to the full scenario calculations. All of these are now subject to multi-annual man-agement plans apart from plaiceVIId, soleVIId and Nephrops. Five scenarios were considered. 1) max: The underlying assumption was that fishing stops when all quota species are fully utilised with respect to the upper limit corresponding to single stock exploitation boundary. 2) min: The underlying assumption was that fishing stops when the catch for the first quota species meets the upper limit corresponding to single stock exploitation boundary. 3) cod: The underlying assumption was that all fleets set their effort at the level corresponding to their cod quota share, regardless of other stocks. 4) sq_E: The effort was set as equal to the effort in the most recently recorded year for which there are landings and discard data. 5) Ef_Mgt: The effort in métiers that used gear controlled by the EU effort management regime had effort adjusted according to the regime. The max and min scenarios were included to bracket the space of potential catch and SSB outcomes but for most fleets are considered unrealistic scenarios. Of the remain-ing scenarios none was picked as a preferred scenario. Effort limits under the EU ef-fort management regime were left unchanged in 2013 and the WG considered the relationship between F and effort changes under the long term management phase of the cod recovery plan open to interpretation but still included the scenario, having made its own interpretation of the control rule. In a change to previous years, the intermediate year made use of the status quo effort scenario before application of the alternative scenarios in the advice year., (previously each scenario was applied in both intermediate and advice year). The change was considered to better reflect the assumptions on fleet behaviour used in the majority of single species short term forecasts. The impact of <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> scenarios on two stocks, northern hake and plaice 3 aN were considered without their incorporation into the <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> projections. The Plaice 3 aN TAC is predicted as underutilised even under assumption of status quo effort. The North Sea quota of Northern Hake is predicted to be underutilised under the min, cod and Ef_Mgt scenarios but assuming status quo effort leads to prediction of over quota landings. As a cross check, the landings by national fleets were summed over nation for each scenario, and the share by country was compared with the initial values input to the model. In general the results indicate that the approach used does not lead to viola-tion of the underlying hypothesis of relative stability in TAC sharing (quotas) across nations. Only minor deviations are observed across scenarios, except for the Ef_Mgt scenario. Here the fact the majority of Scottish vessels come under the scope of the EU effort management regime whereas Norwegian vessels are unaffected by the same regime leads to a shift of landings share from the former to the latter under the as-sumptions of the model. As in 2012 data for this WG was requested as part of a joint WGNSSK-WGMIXFISH data call which allows a greater consistency between catch totals supplied to WGMIXFISH and WGNSSK. As an addition to its terms of reference the group also considered the consistency between the data supplied to this WG and that supplied to STECF for comparable fleet categories.

Irish métiers (groups of homogeneous fishing trips) highlight the complexity of fishing activities within the Irish fleet, having identified 33 otter trawl métiers and 19 in the remainder of the fleet. Métier dynamics identified over compensation to introduced management, resulting in effort displacement and increased temporal specific fishing pressure. Therefore were deemed as appropriate base units for all subsequent analyses. Two economic variables, operational fishing cost and trip landings value, considered to represent important drivers were developed. This lead to application of a general additive model to estimate and predict fuel consumption estimates according to fleet segment definitions. A linear mixed effects model with random vessel effect was developed as a method of standardising value generating an index of value per unit effort. This identified kilowatt fishing days as the most appropriate effort measure. The final investigation stage successfully amalgamated the knowledge gained into the formulation of novel Markov transition probability for a multinomial model to predict fisher métier strategy choice. This is to be incorporated into management strategy evaluation, aiding the assessment and possible impacts of future management proposals on the Irish fleet and commercial stocks around Ireland.

Towed nets including seines and beam trawls equipped with meshes of more than 100 mm resp. more than 80 mm were identified as the main gears effecting the depleted cod and reduced plaice stocks. The saithe sector, using towed nets with meshes of more than 110 mm, longlines, gill nets and others, appears to affect the 7 species to a lesser extend.

Work {{conducted}} {{prior to}} the meeting focused on aspects of the ICES data-limited stocks (DLS) framework; in par-ticular, how robust it is (in terms of delivering more conservative catch advice when less data are available) and whether the performance of some of its age-aggregated methods (e. g. for Category 3) can be improved by including in the Harvest Control Rule (HCR) either a confidence interval for the age-aggregated index used or the average length in the catch relative to some reference level. Indications are that the DLS framework does not always deliver more conservative catch advice when less data are available, and that the performance of HCRs can potentially be improved with additional auxiliary information. The development of generic HCRs, and the use of Fproxy values and targets in HCRs were also considered, and suggestions made for the preparation of survey indices for use in HCRs.

40|$|Current {{fisheries}} advice {{requires an}} increased consideration of bioeconomics and {{the interactions of}} fishing fleets with the biological stocks. This is particularly important when evaluating proposed multi-annual management plans. To achieve this, modelling tools {{need to be able}} to consider the dynamics of individual fisheries. This becomes more challenging with <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> when multiple species are caught by multiple fleets. A suitable balance needs to be found between replicating the details of the complex fishery system and simplifying a model to the level that makes it tractable but still useful. Much of the bioeconomic fisheries modelling work performed at the JRC uses the FLR software framework. The JRC has developed a new FLR package, FLasher, for performing projections and forecasts with multiple individual fisheries and multiple species. This allows the dynamics of <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> to be more accurately modelled and allows the evaluation of the economic performance of alternative management decisions. This document presents some of the features and capabilites of FLasher using a case study based on a semi-realistic flatfish fishery: two fleets with different selectiviuty patterns, bottom trawl and gillnet, catching two species with different life histories and maximum sizes, European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and common sole (Solea solea). FLasher expands the current modelling capabilities of FLR, allowing the impacts of proposed management plans to be evaluated in greater detail by (1) explicitly modelling the dynamics of each individual fleets, which could be affected in different ways by management, (2) forecasting in parallel the full species and fleet assemblage found in <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries,</b> and (3) employing the latest iteration of the C++ language and a new library for automatic differentation.

The adaptive response of the fleets to different implementation scenarios will be mimicked evaluating some scenarios that include: (i) a complete discards ban, and (ii) a combination of de minimis and inter-species flexibility in quota use.

40|$|Achieving single species {{objectives}} in complex and dynamic fisheries targeting multiple species (<b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries)</b> is challenging as achieving the objective for one species may mean missing the objective for another. This particularly {{applies to the}} concept of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) in <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> in the North Sea, where the diversity of species and fisheries induce numerous biological and technical interactions. These interactions are though increasingly well understood and quantified for the most important stocks, allowing for new approaches to emerge. Recent paths towards operationalising MSY at the regional scale have suggested the expansion of the concept into a desirable area of “Pretty Good Yield”, materialised by a range around FMSY that would allow for more flexibility in management targets. This paper investigates the potential of FMSY ranges to combine long-term single-stock targets with flexible short-term mixed-fisheries management requirements, applied to the main North Sea demersal stocks. It is shown that sustained fishing at the upper bound of the range may not be appropriate when technical interactions occur.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a combined catch quota and habitat credit system was explored to manage the sustainable exploitation of a mix of demersal fish species and reduce the benthic impacts of bottom trawl fisheries using a dynamic state variable model approach.

Restricting catch quota for plaice and cod had a limited effect on benthic impact, except when reduced to very low values, forcing the vessels to stay in port. Quota management had a minimal influence on fishing behaviour and hence resulted in a minimal reduction of benthic impact. Habitat credits may reduce the benthic impacts of the trawl fisheries at a minimal loss of landings and revenue, as vessels are still able to reallocate their effort to less vulnerable fishing grounds, while allowing the fishery to catch their catch quota and maintain their revenue. Only if they are reduced to extremely low levels can habitat credits potentially constrain fishing activities to levels that prevent the fisheries from using up the catch quota for the target species...|$|E

The spring spawners had a rela-tively larger eye, deeper head and thicker caudal peduncle, whereas autumn spawners overall had a relatively more elongated body shape.

The proposed parentage-based tagging (PBT) experiment has four components: marker discovery, development of analysis tools, implementation of the parent database, and assignment of known offspring and <b>mixed</b> <b>fishery</b> samples. Utilizing new methods for large scale parentage assignment, the collection of genetic information from a parental breeding generation {{can be used to}} “tag” the offspring cohort. When this is done at a hatchery or at a weir, the entire breeding population of a stock or population can be sampled, and the entire next generation tagged. Offspring can be non-lethally sampled during their seaward migration, in fisheries, and upon return to spawn (at hatcheries or instream). Genotyping is followed by high confidence parentage assignment wherein the inherited genetic tags are used to locate the parents of sampled individuals in the parent database, thereby identifying the stock and cohort of origin. Additionally, we will evaluate whether the same set of genetic markers for PBT are also effective for genetic stock identification (GSI). While PBT can identify the specific parents of an unknown individual (as long as their genetic data is in the parent database), GSI employs baseline samples from each population to which an unknown individual can be assigned...|$|E
40|$|A {{main issue}} in the {{dynamics}} of <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> is that of technical interactions, leading to incidental catch and discarding. Technical interactions largely depend on the allocation of fishing effort between metiers and fishing grounds {{which in turn is}} tightly linked to economic conditions and to the expected profitability of alterna-tive options for fishing effort allocation. We developed a bioeconomic fishery model to investigate these issues, and in particular to explore the possibilities of mitigat-ing these interactions through appropriate policy options. The bioeconomic model was developed using and creating FL...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of multi-annual plans to manage demersal fisheries performed by STECF (2016) is revisited to calculate an additional indicator of fishing mortality that better captures {{the effect of}} using ranges. The results presented are more aligned with the recent multi-annual plans objectives of providing flexible tactics. The analysis is still not a <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> analysis, it is an alternative approach to the one used by STECF (2016) which increases the degree of comparability across the different options, in particular across single point target approaches and value-range approaches.

5000|$|The Firth of Clyde in South West Scotland, {{an area of}} 3650 square miles, is {{the most}} southerly fjord in the {{northern}} hemisphere and extends over 100 km into Scotland’s west coast. Once comprising a highly diverse and rich ecosystem the Firth of Clyde marine environment has seen dramatic alterations throughout the last 200 years. [...] During the 19th century, diverse <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> existed in the Firth of Clyde for herring (Clupea harengus), cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), turbot (Psetta maxima) {{and a variety of}} other species.|$|R
