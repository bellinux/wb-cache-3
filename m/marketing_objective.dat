The Rebel Machine was factory rated at 10.7 pounds per horsepower, positioning the car for the NHRA F-stock class.

5000|$|Marketing mix is {{the most}} {{important}} part of marketing strategy, which is [...] "the framework to manage marketing and incorporate it within a business context".

And the initial step to achieve the marketing strategy to identify the market target and build up plan that the business should implement. [...] Also the business has to make sure every step of achieving marketing target is running effectively. One false step could cause a bad influence to the whole business.

5000|$|Marketing {{strategy}} {{should not}} be confused with a <b>marketing</b> <b>objective</b> or mission. For example, a goal may be to become the market leader, perhaps in a specific niche; a mission may be something along the lines of [...] "to serve customers with honor and dignity"; in contrast, a marketing strategy describes how a firm will achieve the stated goal in a way which is consistent with the mission, perhaps by detailed plans for how it might build a referral network. Strategy varies by type of market. A well-established firm in a mature market will likely have a different strategy than a start-up.

Similarity, establishing branding online can also help to remain an active online presence for any businesses.

The campaign achieved its <b>marketing</b> <b>objective</b> by 80 per cent of users interesting in the new campaign in 2016 (Mintel academic).

James Quinn succinctly defined objectives in general as: Goals (or objectives) state what is to be achieved and when results are to be accomplished, but they do not state [...] "how" [...] the results are to be achieved. They typically relate to what products (or services) will be where in what markets (and must be realistically based on customer behavior in those markets).

Secondly, based on standard and spiteful replicator dynamic equation, use new replicator dynamical equation to study whether the equilibrium points are evolutionary stable strategies. Finally, simulate how the proportion of choosing profit strategy changes as time goes. The study shows that if the market scale meets certain constraints and the weight value of decision preference on the profit maximization <b>marketing</b> <b>objective</b> is more than 1 / 3, the retailer will choose profit as the <b>marketing</b> <b>objective,</b> and vice versa.

However, as with any other marketing tool, there are various factors that influence {{the degree to which}} business-tobusiness conference sponsorship will be effective in contributing to the achievement of a company's strategic <b>marketing</b> <b>objectives.</b> For this dissertation, the research problem is that sponsors do not seem able to accurately measure the degree to which business-to-business conference sponsorship has been effective in achieving their <b>marketing</b> <b>objectives.</b> If sponsors do not know how effective sponsorship has been in achieving their objectives then they cannot make informed decisions about future sponsorships. The purpose of this study therefore, was to examine the evaluation of business-tobusiness conference sponsorship and explore the extent to which sponsors evaluate the degree to which sponsorship has met their <b>marketing</b> <b>objectives.</b> A research survey was conducted amongst senior managers responsible for marketing decisions within their organisations. The findings of the research showed that 17 % of respondents did not set objectives to be achieved though their sponsorship of a business-to-business conference. By not setting objectives, it is unlikely that companies will be able to accurately determine whether the money spent on sponsorship was justified or not. A further 13 % of respondents that did set objectives did not measure {{the extent to which the}} objectives were achieved. The researcher identified eight primary <b>marketing</b> <b>objectives</b> of business-to-business conference sponsorship. These are: Increasing awareness Positioning Sales Niche marketing iii Entertaining clients Database building Networking and forging new business relationships Conduct market research It was found in the research that the most commonly mentioned method to measure the extent to which business-to-business conference sponsorship objectives had been achieved was using a sales-related measure, for example sales revenue. However, the majority of respondents (60 %) also indicated that it was "strongly unlikely" that sales objectives could be achieved through business-to-business conference sponsorship. It is interesting that the majority of respondents (48 %) believe that it is the "fault" of the sponsors themselves that their <b>marketing</b> <b>objectives</b> have not been achieved by sponsoring a business-to-business conference, while 30 % believe that the "fault" lies with the conference organiser. This report concludes with recommendations for both sponsors and conference organisers about how to improve the effectiveness of business-to-business conferenc...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a one-population (indirect) evolutionary game {{model of a}} supply chain with one manufacturer/supplier and many (a sufficiently large number of) retailers to study how the retailer's <b>marketing</b> <b>objective</b> depends on the wholesale price, its observability, the error probability of the observed result on the rival's preference, the market scale and the retailer's bargaining power. This paper also presents an algorithm for computing the optimal wholesale price of the manufacturer. We find that the profit (revenue) maximization behavior is an evolutionarily stable marketing strategy if the wholesale price is sufficiently high (low). Given an appropriate wholesale price, the revenue maximization behavior coexists with the profit maximization behavior in the retailers' population. The larger the market scale, the stronger the motivation of the retailer to take profit maximization behavior due to a higher wholesale price. The cross effects of the retailer's reservation payoff and the other factors {{should be considered in}} the decision process. <b>Marketing</b> <b>objective</b> Wholesale pricing Evolutionarily stable strategy Game theory...|$|E
