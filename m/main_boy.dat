40|$|The {{depiction}} of boyhood in the Western world of comics underwent a subtle {{transformation in the}} shadow of the Second World War. Major artists of these sequential artistic texts (such as Schultz and Spiegelman) fine-tuned key elements in the set of resources they drew on, effectively changing how readers/viewers engage with the young male protagonists in comics. The shift in affect was realized in storylines; instead of these being driven by external, performance-oriented representations of 2 ̆ 7 boyhood 2 ̆ 7 punctuated by mischievous deeds or heroic exploits, drama was created by a much more complex and nuanced {{depiction of}} boyhood that explored the internal emotional and psychological worlds of <b>main</b> <b>boy</b> characters. Drawing on representative examples from two different sets of comics, this article applies a bi-modal, semiotic approach that specifically addresses how facial expressions, gaze and speech/thought bubbles, elements of the interpersonal meta-function, construct a more complex representation of boyhood...|$|E
