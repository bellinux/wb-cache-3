40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a visual, ontology-based query paradigm. It has two novel features: visually specifying aggregate <b>table</b> <b>queries</b> and <b>table</b> layout {{in a single}} process, and providing users with an ontology guide for formulating statistical data analysis tasks as <b>table</b> <b>queries</b> which are composed of the terms defined in ontologies. We describe {{the role of the}} fundamental concept of ontology in the content representation of distributed databases with large numbers of multi-valued attributes, along with the methods and techniques developed for representing and manipulating ontologies, and for understanding semantics of database contents and query formulation and processing. 1...|$|R
50|$|The Q {{programming}} language contains its own <b>table</b> <b>query</b> syntax called q-sql, which resembles traditional SQL but has important differences, mainly {{due to the}} fact that the underlying tables are oriented by column, rather than by row.|$|R
50|$|In the {{database}} container or navigation pane in Access 2007 and later versions, the system automatically categorizes each object by type (e.g., <b>table,</b> <b>query,</b> macro). Many Access developers use the Leszynski naming convention, {{though this is}} not universal; it is a programming convention, not a DBMS-enforced rule. It is particularly helpful in VBA where references to object names may not indicate its data type (e.g. tbl for <b>tables,</b> qry for <b>queries).</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{evaluating}} <b>table</b> <b>queries</b> from a summary database formed by a collection of pre-computed tables on certain measure variables. We assume that every <b>table</b> <b>query</b> asks for the distribution of a measure variable of interest, and that the summary database contains tables on the variable of interest as well as on other measure variables. If the requested distribution is none of the base tables and cannot be exactly derivable from none of them, then the answer to the query will be the result of an estimation procedure, which may bring up another measure variable that is correlated to the measure variable of interest. We give an estimation procedure that combines the “divide-and-conquer ” principle with tree computations...|$|R

50|$|Users {{can create}} <b>tables,</b> <b>queries,</b> forms and reports, and connect them {{together}} with macros. Advanced users can use VBA to write rich solutions with advanced data manipulation and user control. Access also has report creation features that can work with any data source that Access can access.|$|R
50|$|There are {{template}} databases {{within the}} program and for download from Microsoft's website. These options are available upon starting Access and allow users to enhance a database with predefined <b>tables,</b> <b>queries,</b> forms, reports, and macros. Database templates support VBA code but Microsoft's templates do not include VBA code.|$|R
50|$|All {{database}} objects - <b>tables,</b> <b>queries,</b> forms, etc. - {{are stored}} in tables of a single database (either file or server), {{making it easy to}} share data and design.

40|$|Building neural {{networks}} to query a knowledge base (a table) with natural language is an emerging research topic in deep learning. An executor for <b>table</b> <b>querying</b> typically requires multiple steps of execution because queries may have complicated structures. In previous studies, researchers have developed either fully distributed executors or symbolic executors for <b>table</b> <b>querying.</b> A distributed executor {{can be trained}} in an end-to-end fashion, but is weak in terms of execution efficiency and explicit interpretability. A symbolic executor is efficient in execution, but {{is very difficult to}} train especially at initial stages. In this paper, we propose to couple distributed and symbolic execution for natural language queries, where the symbolic executor is pretrained with the distributed executor's intermediate execution results in a step-by-step fashion. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms both distributed and symbolic executors, exhibiting high accuracy, high learning efficiency, high execution efficiency, and high interpretability.

40|$|AbstractIn {{traditional}} relational databases, {{the data}} are stored in "flat" <b>tables.</b> <b>Query</b> processing performance {{is dominated by the}} cost of joining such tables. By contrast, nested relational structures can avoid joins. If, however, such structures are decomposed into nested normal form (NNF) then the number of normal scheme trees in the resulting nested scheme forest may dominate query processing performance. Thus, minimizing the number of such trees is an important design goal. We prove that the problem of finding a succinct NNF scheme forest is NP-hard even for the class of sets of unary multivalued dependencies, which is a subclass of the class of split-free sets of multivalued dependencies...|$|R
