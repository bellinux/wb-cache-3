It consists of a continuous steel band <b>mandrel,</b> <b>supported</b> by beams installed circumferentially to form a cylindrical shape. The mandrel moves continuously in a spiral path towards the exit assembly. As the mandrel rotates, all composite materials are metered onto it in precise amounts, forming one layer after another. As a pipe is being formed on the mandrel, it moves forward to the curing and cutting areas and the finished product comes {{out at the end}} of one continuous production process.|$|R

40|$|Extrusions of {{aluminum}} alloy powder products {{were obtained from}} several sources and evaluated for corrosion resistance to high-temperature (260 [...] 350 deg C) water. Several types of tubing impact-extruded by ALCOA were tested. The stronger tabing (M 655) failed very rapidly. The weaker tubing suffered extensive localized surface attack and penetration of the corrosion attack along the extrusion direction after prolonged (approximates 3 months) exposure to 290 deg C water. A precorrosion heat treatment was effective in reducing both types of attack on the weaker tubing. Armour Research Foundation supplied several types of tubing extraded through a bridge die. All tubes failed on prolonged (approximates 8 months) corrosion in 290 deg C water at the longitudinal bond lines. These lines were formed by the rejoining of the metal streams passing over the <b>mandrel</b> <b>supports</b> in the die during extrusion. Directly extruded tubing supplied by the Torrance Brass Company also failed on extended exposure to 290 deg C water. Many experimental rod extrusions (from Armour Research Foundation and Trefimetaux) exhibited corrosion resistance to static 290 deg C water equivalent to that of wrought alloys. The Trefimetaux specimens were also tested in rapidly flowing water at 315 deg C. Under these conditions a corrosion rate significantly faster than for the wrought alloy was measured. (auth...|$|R
50|$|Tube being hollow, it's not {{practical}} {{to use a}} simple punch operation to notch it, {{as it would be}} squashed. Although punching is possible, it requires <b>support</b> <b>mandrels</b> and awkward handling.

40|$|Cylindrical (hyperbolic - {{parabolic}} Wolter I) mirrors {{have been}} electroformed from nickel over an electroless nickel-phosphorous (NiP) plated aluminum <b>mandrel</b> in <b>support</b> of the NASA AXAF-S x-ray spectrometer program. The electroless nickel was diamond turned and polished {{to achieve a}} surface finish of 10 angstroms rms or better. Gold was then plated on the nickel alloy after an electrochemical passivation step. Next a heavy layer of pure nickel was plated one millimeter thick with controlled stress at zero using a commercial PID program to form the actual mirror. This shell {{was removed from the}} NiP alloy coated mandrel by cryogenic cooling and contraction of the aluminum to release the mirror. It is required that the gold not adhere well to the NiP but all other plated coatings must exhibit good adherence. Four mirrors were fabricated from two mandrels prepared by this method. The area of each part is 0. 7 square meters (7. 5 square feet) ...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic Pulse Welding (MPW) by {{electromagnetic}} compression is a solid-state {{welding technique}} favorable {{for the creation}} of strong metallurgical bonds between both similar and dissimilar metals. The process is based on the plastic deformation of one of the joining partners and the subsequent high velocity collision with the other joining partner. Due to the absence of external heat, brittle intermetallic phases and other heat induced defects are largely avoided which makes the process especially suitable for multi-material joints applied in lightweight design. However, the stationary part must be able to withstand the harsh impact without inadmissibly permanent deformation. This is why mostly solid cylinders are used as parent parts, limiting the lightweight potential. The paper focuses on the MPW of aluminum (ENAW- 6060) to steel (C 45) tubes with and without <b>supporting</b> <b>mandrel</b> inside of the parent part. Experimental studies were performed in which the wall thickness of the parent steel part was reduced successively. The deformation behavior of both the flyer and parent parts was recorded during the experiments by a periscope-style photonic Doppler velocimetry (PDV) setup. It was found that defect-free MPW of aluminum tubes on steel tubes without <b>supporting</b> <b>mandrel</b> is generally possible but strongly depends on the characteristics of the electromagnetic pulse due to the initiation of elastic waves that may deteriorate the weld quality. Critical values for the parent wall thickness were deduced for various pulse shapes and joining partner geometries and the feasibility of supporting elements was investigated...|$|R
40|$|This report {{discusses}} the AC {{losses in the}} MICE channel magnets during magnet charging and discharging. This report talks about {{the three types of}} AC losses in the MICE magnets; the hysteretic AC loss in the superconductor, the coupling AC loss in the superconductor and the eddy current AC loss in the magnet <b>mandrel</b> and <b>support</b> structure. AC losses increase the heat load at 4 K. The added heat load increases the temperature of the second stage of the cooler. In addition, AC loss contributes to the temperature rise between the second stage cold head and the high field point of the magnet, which is usually close to the magnet hot spot. These are the curses of AC loss in the MICE magnet that can limit {{the rate at which the}} magnet can be charge or discharged. If one is willing to allow some of the helium that is around the magnet to boil away during a magnet charge or discharge, AC losses can become a blessing. The boil off helium from the AC losses can be used to cool the upper end of the HTS leads and the surrounding shield. The AC losses are presented for all three types of MICE magnets. The AC loss temperature drops within the coupling magnet are presented as an example of how both the curse and blessing of the AC losses can be combined...|$|R
40|$|A lifting fixture (drawing number 3823. 113 -MD- 372382) that lifts large steel {{mandrels}} {{from one}} end through the <b>mandrel's</b> end <b>support</b> web is described. The mandrels are used as a mold to form carbon fiber cylinders. The mandrels are held {{from one end}} to allow the carbon cylinder to be pulled horizontally off the mandrel. Only mandrels as described in drawing numbers 3823. 113 -MD- 358992 and 3823. 1 13 -MD- 358994 are lifted by the fixture. The largest mandrel is 41 inches in diameter, 120 inches long, and weighs approximately 3, 000 lbs. A detailed procedure for removing the carbon cylinder from the steel mandrel is given in the Appendix. The fixture is to be supported only using Fermilab Forklift 10207 or equivalent. The forklift has a nameplate capacity of 12, 000 lbs 24 inches from the mast at an elevation of 130 inches from the floor. The forklift forks must be removed from the truck prior to using the fixture. The forklift is to be used to <b>support</b> the <b>mandrels</b> only during the lifting operation and is not to be used to transport the mandrels. Stresses at the lifting fixture are shear stresses on the support brackets due to the overall weight of the mandrel and moment loads due to the cantilever style suppOrt. The moment on the forklift due to the overhanging weight of the mandrel is calculated. Stresses in the mandrel due to the method of support are also described...|$|R
40|$|The United States ITER Project Office (USIPO) is {{responsible}} for design of the Toroidal Field (TF) insert coil, which will allow validation {{of the performance of}} significant lengths of the conductors {{to be used in the}} full scale TF coils in relevant conditions of field, current density and mechanical strain. The Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) will build the TF insert which will be tested at the Central Solenoid Model Coil (CSMC) Test facility at JAEA, Naka, Japan. Three dimensional mathematical model of TF Insert was created based on the initial design geometry data, and included the following features: orthotropic material properties of superconductor material and insulation; external magnetic field from CSMC, temperature dependent properties of the materials; pre-compression and plastic deformation in lap joint. Major geometrical characteristics of the design were preserved including cable jacket and insulation shape, <b>mandrel</b> outline, and <b>support</b> clamps and spacers.

Numerical simulations were performed for room temperature conditions; cool down to 4 K, and the operating regime with 68 kA current at 11. 8 Tesla background field. Numerical simulations led to the final design of the coil producing the required strain levels on the cable, while simultaneously satisfying the ITER magnet structural design criteria...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of multi-material concepts, for example, in automotive engineering or aerospace technologies, requires adequate joining techniques. The Magnetic Pulse Welding (MPW) process allows for joining both similar and dissimilar materials without additional mechanical elements, chemical binders, or adverse influences of heat on the joining partners. In this process, an electro-conductive at (‘flyer’) part is accelerated by Lorentz forces and impacts the inner (‘parent’) part under high velocity and high pressure, {{leading to the}} formation of a metallurgical joint. Besides joining of sheets and tubes to solid cylinders, the connection of two tubes is of particular interest due to the increased lightweight potential. The present paper focuses on the MPW of aluminum (EN AW- 6060) to steel (C 45) tubes. An experimental study was performed, in which the wall thickness of the parent part was reduced successively. The deformation behavior of both the flyer and parent parts was recorded during the experiments by a two-probe Photon Doppler Velocimeter (PDV). The final shape of the joined specimens was analyzed by a 3 D digitizer. An instrumented peel test was used for the determination of the weld quality. It was found that defect-free MPW of aluminum tubes on steel tubes without <b>supporting</b> <b>mandrel</b> is possible...|$|R
40|$|The {{technology}} of precision bending of tubes has recently increased in importance and is widely demanded for many industrial applications. However, whilst {{attention has been}} concentrated on automation and increasing the production rate of the bending machines, it seems that with one exception very little {{work has been done}} in order to understand and therefore fundamentally improve the bending process. A new development for the process of draw-bending of tubes, in which the <b>supporting</b> <b>mandrel</b> is axially vibrated at an ultrasonic frequency, has been perfected. A research programme was undertaken to study the mechanics of tube• bending under both vibratory and non-vibratory conditions. For this purpose, a conventional tube-bending machine was modified and equipped with an oscillatory system. Thin-walled mild steel tubes of different diameter to thickness ratios were bent to mean bend radii having various values from 1. 5 to 2. 0 times the tube diameter. It was found that the application of ultrasonic vibration reduces the process forces and that the force reduction increases with increasing the vibration amplitude. A reduction in the bending torque of up to 30 per cent was recorded and a reduction in the maximum tube-wall thinning of about 15 per cent was observed. The friction vector reversal mechanism as well as a reduction in friction account for the changes of the forces and the strains. Monitoring the mandrel friction during bending showed, in some cases, that the axial vibration reverses the mandrel. mean force from tension to compression and, thus, the mandrel is assisting the tube motion instead of resisting it. A theory has been proposed to describe the mechanics of deformation during draw-bending of tubes, which embodies the conditions of both "with" and "without" mandrel axial vibration. A theoretical analysis, based on the equilibrium of forces approach, has been developed in which the basic process parameters were taken into consideration. The stresses, the strains and the bending torque were calculated utilising this new solution, and a specially written computer programme was used to perform the computations. It was shown that the theory is in good agreement with the measured values of the strains under vibratory and non-vibratory conditions. Also, the predicted bending 'torque showed a similar trend to that recorded experimentally...|$|R
