5|$|Harvard {{refused to}} attend the rules conference {{organized}} by the other schools and continued to play under its own code. While Harvard's decision to maintain its code <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> for them to schedule games against other American universities, it agreed to play McGill University, from Montreal, in a two-game series in 1874. Harvard won the first game, in which its rules were used, 3–0. The second game, which was played under rugby regulations, {{did not have a}} winner as neither team managed to score.|$|E
5|$|In the {{commentary}} for the episode, Anderson elaborated on Scully and Waterston's original backstory: after Scully and Waterston {{came close to}} having an affair, Scully left to study at Quantico to become an FBI agent. After she left, Waterston become depressed, and his family began to suspect the affair. The emotional turmoil {{was too much for}} Waterston's wife, who killed herself, which made Waterston's daughter, Maggie, resent Scully, as shown in the finished episode. Anderson felt that the removal of this backstory <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> for the audience to understand why Maggie was so angry at Scully.|$|E
5|$|Local {{opinion was}} heavily against Thornton. Pamphlets were sold {{purporting}} to show Thornton's guilt, and poems were composed {{with the same}} theme. The defendant's solicitor complained of these, alleging it <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to find an unbiased jury. On 8 August 1817, people filled {{the street in front}} of County Hall in Warwick, where the trial was to take place. When the judge, Sir George Sowley Holroyd (a justice of the Court of King's Bench) began proceedings at 8a.m., people rushed to fill the available seating, and the public benches remained full throughout the one-day trial. Because of the nature of the evidence, women were not permitted to witness the trial.|$|E

50|$|The Soviet Union {{introduced}} its first look-down/shoot-down radar with the Sapfir-23P on the Mikoyan MiG-23 interceptor.

5|$|The Clan Class {{was based}} upon the Britannia Class design, {{incorporating}} a smaller boiler and various weight-saving measures to increase the route availability of a Pacific-type locomotive for its intended area of operations, the west of Scotland. The Clan Class received a mixed reception from crews, with those regularly operating the locomotives giving favourable reports as regards performance. However, trials {{in other areas of}} the British Railways network returned negative feedback, a common complaint being that difficulty in steaming the locomotive <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to adhere to timetables. Reports exist that suggest a degree of the disappointment with these locomotives was attributable to their being allocated to Class 7 work where they were only a Class 6 in reality; a problem put down to their very similar appearance to the BR Standard Class 7.|$|E
5|$|The Corporal had {{numerous}} limitations. It {{took a long}} time to set up, so it could not engage targets of opportunity; there could be delays in the countdown process, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to warn the troops to close their eyes or aircraft to avoid the area; and it was guided by a radio beam that not only could be jammed, but could actually be diverted. Moreover, during test firings in the Outer Hebrides, although eight out of twelve missiles accurately hit their targets, four fell short, which is always regrettable but particularly so when nuclear weapons are involved in view of the danger it posed to one's own troops. A new British project was therefore launched to develop a better missile, codenamed Blue Water, which was to have used the British Indigo Hammer and later the Tony warhead.|$|E
5|$|The spacewalk {{scene on}} the Enterprise {{exterior}} {{was one of the}} most challenging sets to envision and construct for the film. The production had to design a space suit that looked practical rather than exaggerated. Fans were built into the helmets so that the actors would not get overheated, and neon lights built into the front so that the occupant's faces could be seen. When the actors first put the helmets on, the fully enclosed design <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to breathe; after a minute of wearing the suit Stewart became ill, and shooting was discontinued. The set for the ship's outer hull and deflector dish were built on gimbals at Paramount's largest sound stage, surrounded by bluescreen and rigged with wires for the zero gravity sequences. The stage was not large enough to accommodate a full-sized replica of the Enterprise dish, so Zimmerman had to scale down the plans by 15percent.|$|E

5|$|Before 1854, {{the area}} based around Bridgeton {{was a strong}} {{business}} and legal section in Cape May County. The local residents there, however, {{wanted to have a}} strong banking industry, but a local named Richard Holmes along with several other locals turned to the strong type of enterprise, a turnpike company. Holmes and the locals began a local turnpike syndicate with other businessmen and began the Cape May Turnpike Company upon incorporation in 1854. The turnpike company, upon incorporation, was to build a toll road along roughly the U.S. Route 9 corridor. Progress in constructing the toll road was slow at first, with subscribers from Cape May County being hesitant to buy stock from the turnpike company. A friend of Richard Holmes, Wilmon Whilldin, owned a steamboat company in Cape May and apologized for not buying stock in the company. Citing the Panic of 1857 <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to convert securities to cash, Whilldin suggested that a steamboat would be more profitable than the turnpike. The money from the steamboat would go ahead and helped the financially depressed businesses in local communities.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Chadwick was {{appointed}} Dean of Christ Church, uniquely a dual {{role as a}} cathedral dean and head of a college. This period was not entirely happy; a scholarly ability to see all sides of a question, along with an ingrained desire not to upset his colleagues, sometimes <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> {{for him to make}} a quick or firm decision. However, during his time as Dean the college benefited from a continued programme of renovation with internal changes that provided more student accommodation. The position gave Chadwick the chance to influence the musical direction of the cathedral. In The Independent newspaper, obituary writer Andrew Louth notes that at the retirement of Sydney Watson as organist, when he and Chadwick played piano duets together Chadwick's technique was the equal of Watson's. The new organist, Simon Preston, had ambitious plans for improving musical standards, and Chadwick was pleased to be able to support these, not least by raising funds for a new organ.|$|E
5|$|Just {{two years}} after opening, a flood in March 1904 did serious damage to the structure. However, the owners hired the Horseheads Bridge Company, run by the Perkins brothers. They charged $7,000 (1904 USD) to {{complete}} repairs of the bridge. With the reopening of the bridge, and along with the newly constructed Erie Railroad station, a new revitalization came to Skinners Falls and Milanville, including an acid company, creamery, and a dairy company, which helped raise income for the bridge using the $0.22 toll. One company that could not make it is the Skinners' timber rafting, which had been in business for over 140 years. In 1914, J. Skinner was the new owner, but the company was devastated when one of their timber rafts collided with a Myers family-owned ferryboat, killing four. The blame {{was placed on the}} ferry operator. However, along with the tragedy, the lack of riverside forests <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> for timber rafting to prosper and in 1914, they closed their doors.|$|E

5|$|Nowhere was demobilization more of {{a problem}} than at Los Alamos, where there was an exodus of talent. Much {{remained}} to be done. The bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were like laboratory pieces; work would be required to make them simpler, safer and more reliable. Implosion methods needed to be developed for uranium in place of the wasteful gun method, and composite uranium-plutonium cores were needed now that plutonium was in short supply because of the problems with the reactors. However, uncertainty {{about the future of the}} laboratory <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to induce people to stay. Oppenheimer returned to his job at the University of California and Groves appointed Norris Bradbury as an interim replacement. In fact, Bradbury would remain in the post for the next 25 years. Groves attempted to combat the dissatisfaction caused by the lack of amenities with a construction program that included an improved water supply, three hundred houses, and recreation facilities.|$|E
5|$|Team 3D's {{feud with}} the X Division {{continued}} into Final Resolution. The two teams fought {{again on the}} December 6, 2007 episode of Impact! in a Six Man Tag Team Ladder match, which Johnny Devine and Team 3D won. On the December 20, 2007 episode of Impact!, Jay Lethal and MCMG defeated Devine and Team 3D in a Double North Pole match to determine the stipulation to their match at Final Resolution; choosing an Ultimate X match over a Plate glass Tables match. On the January 3, 2008 episode of Impact!, Team 3D attacked and injured MCMG in the storyline by beating their hands with kendo sticks, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to compete in an Ultimate X match in storyline. At Final Resolution, Devine and Team 3D won the bout. The feud {{came to an end}} at Against All Odds, where Lethal and MCMG defeated Devine and Team 3D in a Street Fight to save the X Division from disbandment.|$|E
5|$|The natural {{radioactivity}} of thorium and uranium <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> {{to determine what}} was happening when these elements were bombarded with neutrons but, after correctly eliminating the presence of elements lighter than uranium but heavier than lead, Fermi concluded that they had created new elements, which he called hesperium and ausonium. The chemist Ida Noddack criticised this work, suggesting {{that some of the}} experiments could have produced lighter elements than lead rather than new, heavier elements. Her suggestion was not taken seriously at the time because her team had not carried out any experiments with uranium, and its claim to have discovered masurium (technetium) was disputed. At that time, fission was thought to be improbable if not impossible on theoretical grounds. While physicists expected elements with higher atomic numbers to form from neutron bombardment of lighter elements, nobody expected neutrons to have enough energy to split a heavier atom into two light element fragments in the manner that Noddack suggested.|$|E
50|$|In {{the study}} of aging, Patrick Rabbitt {{proposed}} an effortfulness hypothesis in the 1960s: that as their hearing became less acute with age, people would require additional effort to make out what was said and that this effort <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> to remember <b>it.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War in 1861 between {{the northern and southern}} states also contributed to the trend. The war disrupted the sale of northern ice to the south, and Maine merchants instead turned to supplying the Union Army, whose forces used ice in their more southern campaigns. James L. Cheeseman had responded to the 1860 ice famine by moving his ice trading business from the Hudson northwards into Maine, bringing with him the latest technology and techniques; Cheeseman went on to win valuable contracts with the Union Army during the war years. Carré ice machines were brought into New Orleans to make up the shortfall in the south, focusing in particular on supplying southern hospitals. In the post-war years, the number of such plants increased, but once competition from the north recommenced, cheaper natural ice initially <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> for the manufacturers to make a profit. By the late 1870s, however, efficiency improvements were allowing them to squeeze natural ice out of the marketplace in the south.|$|E
5|$|After the Sunday rest day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 {{runs and}} six wickets in hand. The morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages, which {{increased}} England's chances of saving the game. Just ten {{minutes after the}} start of the day's play, heavy rain intervened. The weather cleared and Miller and Brown moved to lunch on 63 and 32 respectively, having advanced Australia to 409/4. Miller was given a life before lunch when he hit a ball high into the air; Dollery stood right under it and had ample time to prepare, but dropped the catch. In 88 minutes of play, Australia added a further 66 runs. During this time, the third new ball became available, but England opted not to use it immediately, as the wet and slippery ground had <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> for the bowlers to grip the ball or run up to the crease with confidence; the hosts instead waited for drier conditions so they could exercise more control over the ball. However, after a period of using his slower bowlers, Yardley opted to take the new ball, and Miller hit three boundaries to pass 50, and both batsmen lifted their rate of scoring. It appeared that aside from the need to score quickly in preparation for the declaration, both players found the new ball easier to see than its muddied predecessor. Miller hooked Coxon repeatedly, and drove Bedser for many runs. Bradman was expected to declare just before lunch so he could attack the English openers for a short period before the adjournment, but a shower at this time deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled to grip the ball; Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times.|$|E
5|$|After the {{repeated}} German counterattacks prevented any lasting roadblock Truscott finally allowed reinforcements from the 45thDivision to support Dahlquist at Montélimar, {{as he felt}} the successful operations further south at the French ports allowed him to refocus to the north. At the same time, the Germans also reinforced their fighting force. Over the next days a stalemate emerged, with the Allies unable to block the retreat route and the Germans unable to clear {{the area of the}} Allied forces. Both sides became increasingly frustrated during the fighting, with attack, counterattack, and spoiling attacks, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> for the 36thDivision to launch a decisive offensive. Whilst the 36thDivision had surrounded the 19thArmy, they themselves were almost surrounded, too, during the chaotic fighting, with only a thin supply route to the east open, resulting in their having to fight to the front and the rear. As the 36thDivision was seemingly making no progress, an angry Truscott arrived at Dahlquist's headquarters on 26August to relieve him of command. However, on seeing the heavy terrain and shattered forces, he refrained and left the headquarters again. Finally, during 26–28August, the majority of the German forces were able to escape, leaving behind 4,000 burnt-out vehicles and 1,500 dead horses. On 29August the Allies captured Montélimar, and the final German troops trying to break out surrendered. The Germans suffered 2,100 battle casualties plus 8,000 POWs, while the Americans had 1,575 casualties. Total POW losses of the 19thArmy now amounted to 57,000.|$|E
