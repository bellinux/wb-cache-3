Symmetry and functional parity of the gonads were observed in both sexes,but there was no signiﬁcant temp oral variation in either sex {{for any of the}} reproductive parameters studied. Ovulation and egg-deposition were similarly intensive in both seasons. In adult females, there was an ovarian resting period at an individual level, though it was not synchronized at a population level. Distribution of egg-bearing females was not related to depth or species' range...|$|R
30|$|Two {{treatments}} by ABA (10 − 3  mg/l) {{were made}} during the development and growth of the olives: olive trees are treated at fruit set, other trees are treated at veraison, and other trees are left without treatment as control.

30|$|The {{application}} of ethephon, at fruit set or veraison, {{leads to a}} very rapid and intense degradation of protopectins (more than 80 %) from veraison. After 45  days, {{the difference between the}} protopectin levels and the soluble pectin content disappears. Under these conditions, protopectins reached low levels precociously compared to the control and even a lower level than that recorded at the <b>total</b> <b>maturity</b> of the control.|$|R

30|$|Two {{treatments}} with ethephon at 100  mg/L {{were carried}} out by spraying before sunrise during the development {{and the growth of}} olives. The trees of this experiment were divided into three lots of 12 trees each: the first was treated with ethephon at fruit set; the second was treated with ethephon at the veraison; and the third and the third untreated as a control.

500|$|Due to {{the unique}} {{characteristics}} of this ray it is very common {{to be found in}} pet trade, many people ignore the fact that in <b>total</b> <b>maturity</b> the size of the ray exceeds the capacity of many household aquariums. The bluespotted stingray is generally fished for its meat, being either smoked and salted or dried for local markets, but inexpensive due to its small size. It is caught in mass in bottom trawl, trammel, and fish traps. The bluespotted stingray is very venomous and it has a barb approximately [...] long. [...] The venom contains serotonin, 5' nucleotidase, and phosphodiesterase.|$|R
30|$|For all treatments, the {{quantities}} of extracted oils are very low at veraison, then increase during maturation {{to reach their}} maximum values at <b>total</b> <b>maturity</b> (Table  6). The treatment of olive trees at fruit set or veraison results in a rapid and significant increase in {{the quantities}} of extracted oils. These extracted quantities are, respectively, 34 and 29 % higher than those of the mature control and 324 and 307 % higher if the same sampling date is taken into account. This rapid increase {{is the result of the}} early maturity induced by ethephon estimated at about 6  weeks.|$|R

40|$|The {{use of the}} <b>total</b> <b>maturity</b> score (TMS) as a {{means of}} {{estimating}} gestational age was assessed in a population of 76 low birthweight infants (less than or equal to 2500 g) and 80 matched controls (greater than 2500 g) all of certain gestational ages. The gestational ages, derived from the last menstrual period and from the TMS, were similar except in preterm low birthweight infants. The discrepancy in this group was attributed to the structure of the scoring system. It is concluded that the TMS is a convenient and accurate method of assessing gestational age in term babies...|$|R
