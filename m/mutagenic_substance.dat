40|$|The current {{knowledge}} about the ecological relevance of <b>mutagenic</b> <b>substances</b> is described. Mutations can be divided in somatic and germ-line mutations. Current screening methods in genotoxicology are focussed on the protection of man, and therefore somatic mutations are the most crucial. In the field, these mutations are only a hazard for natural populations of species with a low reproductive output. These species {{are supposed to be}} protected by the current screening methods. Germ-line mutations seem to be more relevant for natural populations, but screening on these mutations does not take place in the regular testing of substances. However, the frequency of germ-line mutations is probably much lower. Germ-line mutations can be divided between non-lethal and lethal mutations. Lethal mutations do not pose a risk, as they disappear in the next generation. Non-lethal mutations only pose a risk when genes are affected that influence the fitness of the phenotype negatively. However, the current screening methods for somatic mutations are supposed to act as a safeguard for heritable effects. It is concluded that the methods in the regular hazard assessment of substances likely provide a base for protecting natural populations against <b>mutagenic</b> <b>substances...</b>|$|R

50|$|When a {{compound}} is suspected to be mutagenic/carcinogenic an Ames test {{is used to}} test this. It uses histidine-requiring yeast strains or bacteria. The strains have been altered with a mutation in a gene important for histidine production, so they require histidine for growth. The cells are grown on a histidine rich medium and are then transferred to a medium that lacks histidine and contains the potential <b>mutagenic</b> <b>substance.</b> If the <b>mutagenic</b> <b>substance</b> causes mutations, {{there is a very}} small chance that another mutation occurs in the histidine gene which again enables the production of histidine. These cells are then able to grow on the medium lacking histidine. The mutagenicity of {{a compound}} is calculated by the number of yeast colonies which are reverted to the histidine-independent form. In one study, the Ames test was executed with benzocfluorene. Two different strains were used, TA100 and TA98. One group of each strain had a rat liver fraction and one group did not. The difference between the TA100 and the TA98 strain is that the TA98 strain has a frameshift mutation, and the TA100 has a base substitution mutation. When the amount of benzocfluorene is increased in TA 100 yeast strain, the amount of revertants per plate does not increase. Only in the TA98 strain plate, which contained a fraction of a rat liver, a higher dose of benzocfluorene seems to correspond with a larger amount of revertants. This indicates that benzocfluorene is metabolized by enzymes in the rat liver into more potent mutagenic compounds. These compounds only affected the TA98 strain. This indicates that the adducts formed by benzocfluorene metabolites cause frameshift mutations, and not point mutations.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} the analysis of structure of carcinogenic or <b>mutagenic</b> chemical <b>substances</b> and dusts occurring in Polish enterprises, 2011 – 2012, including the number of exposed employees reported to the “Central register of data on exposure to carcinogenic or <b>mutagenic</b> chemical <b>substances,</b> mixtures, agents or technological processes”, Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine, Łódź. In the paper the aims, range and methodology of data collecting by the Central Register are presented. Material and Methods: Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the data on occupational exposure to carcinogenic substances and technological processes reported by employers were carried out. Results: In 2011 – 2012 approximately 2600 plants reported more than 300 carcinogenic or <b>mutagenic</b> chemical <b>substances</b> annually. The most common occupational chemical carcinogens/mutagens were: benzene, one of the unspecified gasoline, chromium(VI) compounds, asbestos, chromium(VI) trioxide, ethylene oxide and benzo[a]pyrene. The highest number of employees was exposed to particular polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Hardwood dust was the major occupational carcinogen listed in the technological processes inventory with approximately 11 000 employees exposed in about 650 enterprises annually. Conclusions: The amended legislation concerning occupational exposure to carcinogens has not significantly influenced the exposure structure in Poland. Nevertheless it permited to determine the actual total number of the occupationally exposed to carcinogens. Med Pr 2015; 66 (1) : 29 – 3...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of the potent mutagenicity of AF- 2, which was once used in Japan as a food preservative, has exerted a great influence not only on screening procedures for carcinogenic compounds but also on legislative approaches to <b>mutagenic</b> <b>substances.</b> It promoted the synthesis of exceedingly sensitive and reliable tester strains in Salmonella and supported the hypothesis of a common mechanism between mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. Thus preliminary screening for carcinogenic substances has become feasible using mutagenicity as an index. It also contributed greatly to the formulation of legislative measures for chemical substances which {{for the first time}} gave due attention to mutagenicity. Furthermore, the exposure of a large population to such a potent mutagen raised a question as to what extent the genetic constitution of the Japanese population might have been damaged.

40|$|The {{exposure}} of workers to carcinogens in a workplace {{is a crucial}} issue of occupational health and safety.

Therefore, it is necessary to provide employers of companies producing, using or processing carcinogens with methods and tools for estimation and qualitative evaluation of exposure to these dangerous substances that are simple to use, but give reliable results. Accelerating work on the review of Directive 2004 / 37 /EC and extending the list of substances with the binding values until 2020 with 50 carcinogenic and/or <b>mutagenic</b> <b>substances,</b> is a priority direction of EU actions in the field of occupational health and safety...|$|R

40|$|To {{facilitate}} {{detection of}} genotoxicity from environmental mutagen exposure we generated an in vitro green fluorescence protein (GFP) activation assay that quickly and effectively detects frameshift mutations in {{tandem repeat sequences}} (TRS). Two murine cell lines were stably transfected with GFP reporter plasmids in which the GFP constructs contain TRS that shift the GFP coding sequence out of frame. These included several 2 - 6 bp repeat sequences, a control non-repetitive sequence and a human gene sequence with TRS. Transfected cultures were exposed to five model chemicals: hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), 12 -O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA), benzo-a-pyrene-diol-epoxide (BPDE), ethyl nitrosourea (ENU), 9 -aminoacridine (9 AA). Frameshift mutations resulted in green fluorescent revertants, as determined by flow cytometry and confirmed by sequencing.
