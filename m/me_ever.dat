Yours sincerely, Mary.|$|E
500|$|Manning is a Christian. At age 13, he said, [...] "I {{committed}} {{my life to}} Christ, {{and that}} faith has been most important to <b>me</b> <b>ever</b> since." [...] Manning said his priorities ranked in order are [...] "...faith, family, friends, and football." [...] Manning said he prays every night and before games and added, [...] "I hope (and pray) I don't do too many things that displease Him before I get to Heaven myself. I believe, too, that life is much better and freer when you're committed to God in that way." ...|$|E
500|$|In a reply {{published}} on 22 June 1861, a Mr F. FitzHenry {{claimed to have}} known the Pig-faced Lady's sister, stating that [...] "Lady C.B. lived in Chelsea: her sister, Lady H.W., was much admired as a beauty. I was at a dinner-party forty years ago with Lady H.W., when all the party were cautioned previously not {{to say a word}} about pigs, out of delicacy to Lady H.W." [...] In the same issue, a George Lloyd claimed to have seen the Pig-faced Lady in Wakefield in around 1828–29 [...] "but was too young to take a note further than a mental one, which has haunted <b>me</b> <b>ever</b> since".|$|E

500|$|Brooks {{discussed}} the cultural {{influences on the}} novel. He claimed inspiration from [...] (1984) by Studs Terkel, stating: [...] " [...] an oral history of World War II. I read it when I was a teenager and it's sat with <b>me</b> <b>ever</b> since. When I sat down to write World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War, I {{wanted it to be}} in the vein of an oral history." [...] Brooks also cited renowned zombie film director George A. Romero as an influence and criticized the Return of the Living Dead films: [...] "They cheapen zombies, make them silly and campy. They've done for the living dead what the old Batman TV show did for the Dark Knight." [...] Brooks acknowledged making several references to popular culture in the novel, including one to alien robot franchise Transformers, but declined to identify the others so that readers could discover them independently.|$|E
500|$|Carey {{was unable}} to film an {{accompanying}} music video for the single; {{at the time of}} its release, she was recovering from a physical and emotional breakdown that left her hospitalized in August 2001, and caused her to cancel all public appearances to promote Glitter. She said, [...] "When I was asked about the video I said, 'I can't do it today'. And nobody could accept that answer. And that's when I started to get mad. I was, like, look, I am too fatigued. I'm overly-tired, I can't do it as a human being. And nobody was hearing those last two words — human being. They were used to the Mariah that always says, 'Come on, let's fight, let's go'. They just weren't used to <b>me</b> <b>ever</b> saying no. I never said no before". Instead, a video was created using a scene taken directly from the film, where Billie Frank (played by Carey) sings the song at Madison Square Garden during her first sold-out concert. Frank's performance of the song in the film omits its entire second verse, and the song's development runs in parallel with the film's love story.|$|E
500|$|New Musical Express {{journalist}} Nick Kent jammed occasionally {{with the}} band, but left upon Lydon's recruitment. [...] "When I came along, I {{took one look}} at him and said, 'No.That has to go,'" [...] Lydon later explained. [...] "He's never written a good word about <b>me</b> <b>ever</b> since." [...] In September, McLaren again helped hire private rehearsal space for the group, who had been practising in pubs. Cook, with a full-time job he was loath to give up, was making noises about quitting. According to Matlock's later description, Cook [...] "created a smokescreen" [...] by claiming Jones was not skilled enough to be the band's sole guitarist. An advertisement was placed in Melody Maker for a [...] "Whizz Kid Guitarist. Not older than 20. Not worse looking than Johnny Thunders" [...] (referring to a leading member of the New York punk scene). Most of the guitar players who auditioned were incompetent, but in McLaren's view, the process created a new sense of solidarity among the four band members. Steve New was considered the only talented guitarist who tried out and the band invited him to join. Jones was improving rapidly, and the band's developing sound had no room for the technical lead work at which New was adept. He departed after a month.|$|E

"We {{knew little}} of folksong, but the Manx National Songs were often sung and played, {{and it was}} about this time, I think, that I first became {{conscious}} of my Manx nationality, and felt the first stirrings of that passionate love for the Island and all things Manx which has been with <b>me</b> <b>ever</b> since." ...|$|E
2500|$|Heinz Werner Höber, the twofold Glauser prize winner, was a {{follower}} of May. He said, [...] "When I was about 12 years old I wrote my first novel on Native Americans which was, of course, {{from the beginning to}} the end completely stolen from Karl May." [...] He had pleaded with friends to get him to Radebeul [...] "because Radebeul meant Karl May".

2500|$|Asked {{if he had}} any regrets, he said: [...] "If I {{had seen}} the banking crisis coming. Nobody advised me, no economist, all those people now writing books saying 'I told you so' – none of them." [...] On Anglo Irish Bank, he said: [...] "I can {{honestly}} say that not once did anyone or any delegation that came in to see <b>me</b> <b>ever</b> say, ‘Watch out for Anglo’ ... I wish they had have." [...] Referring to the [...] "great economic storm" [...] currently under way in Ireland, he warned against excessive pessimism: [...] "Some gains have been lost, but in truth many remain. I dearly wish there was no crisis. I realise {{that it would have been}} better if some things had been done differently, but I will not denigrate the good that has been done," [...] he added.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, Bob and Sara Dylan {{sold their}} Woodstock home and {{purchased}} a modest property on the Point Dume peninsula, north of Malibu, California. They commenced constructing a large home on this site, {{and the subsequent}} re-modelling of the house occupied the next two years. Sounes writes that during this period, tensions {{began to appear in}} their marriage. The Dylans still retained a house in Manhattan. In April 1974, Dylan began to take art classes with artist Norman Raeben in New York. Dylan would later say in an interview that the art lessons caused problems in his marriage: [...] "I went home after that first day and my wife never did understand <b>me</b> <b>ever</b> since that day. That's when our marriage started breaking up. She never knew what I was talking about, what I was thinking about, and I couldn't possibly explain it." ...|$|E
2500|$|As soon as {{the results}} of the March 9, 2008 {{primaries}} were announced, NPP's Second Vice President, Miriam Ramírez de Ferrer, announced her immediate resignation, saying [...] "Effectively right now I am no longer the Second Vice President of this party. You will not see <b>me</b> <b>ever</b> again involved in active politics, party reunions or party meetings, as I now plan to become a private citizen. There's a lot of things I haven't done I want to do, and I'll also do some things I have to do to help the statehood cause". Ramírez was a candidate for Resident Commissioner in the primaries and was openly supporting Rosselló. She lost to Fortuño's candidate, Pedro Pierluisi, and to another Rosselló supporter who was also defeated, former Senate President, Charlie Rodríguez. When Ramírez was asked by the media if she will vote for Fortuño, she replied [...] "My vote is secret".|$|E

2500|$|He replied: [...] "I was a Member for Wolverhampton for {{a quarter}} of a century. What I saw in those early years of the {{development}} of this problem in Wolverhampton has made it impossible for <b>me</b> <b>ever</b> to dissociate myself from this gigantic and tragic problem". He also criticised the view that the causes of the riots were economic: [...] "Are we seriously saying that so long as there is poverty, unemployment and deprivation our cities will be torn to pieces, that the police in them will be the objects of attack and that we shall destroy our own environment? Of course not". Dame Judith Hart attacked his speech as [...] "an evil incitement to riot". Powell replied: [...] "I am within the judgment of the House, as I am within the judgment of the people of this country, and I am content to stand before either tribunal".|$|E
2500|$|The {{leader of}} the Russian {{delegation}} is a Jew, named Joffe, who has recently been released from Siberia [...] after the meal I had a first conversation with Mr. Joffe. His whole theory is simply based on the universal application {{of the right of}} self-governance of nations in the broadest form. The thus liberated nations then have to be brought to love each other [...] I advised him that we would not attempt to imitate the Russian example and that we likewise would not tolerate a meddling in our internal affairs. If he continued to hold on his utopic viewpoints the peace would not be possible and then he would be well advised just to take the journey back with the next train. Mr. Joffe looked astonishedly at me with his gentle eyes and was silent for a while. Then he continued in a – for <b>me,</b> <b>ever</b> unforgettable – friendly, or I would even nearly say suppliant, tone: 'I very much hope that we will also be able to raise the revolution in your country...' ...|$|E
2500|$|Within {{the land}} of Mordor where it was forged, the Ring's power {{increased}} so significantly that even without wearing it the bearer could draw upon it, and could acquire an aura of terrible power. When Sam encountered an orc in the Tower of Cirith Ungol while holding the Ring, he appeared to the orc as a powerful warrior cloaked in shadow [...] " [...] some nameless menace of power and doom." [...] The orc was so terrified that it fled. Similarly at Mount Doom, when Frodo and Sam were attacked by Gollum, Frodo grabbed the Ring and appeared as [...] "a figure robed in white... held a wheel of fire." [...] Frodo told Gollum [...] "in a commanding voice" [...] that [...] "If you touch <b>me</b> <b>ever</b> again, you shall be cast yourself into the Fire of Doom," [...] a statement fulfilled when Gollum fell into Mount Doom with the Ring. Although the Ring was certainly invoked with this statement, {{it is unclear whether}} Frodo was prophesying (Frodo had previously seen less sinister visions while in possession of the Ring), or if Frodo was actively laying a curse upon Gollum.|$|E
