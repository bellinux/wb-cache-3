50|$|Screen Mesh- Just like thread is woven {{together}} to create cloth, metal wire can be woven to create a <b>metal</b> <b>cloth.</b> Screen Mesh has evolved over many years of competitive screen manufacturing resulting in very thin yet strong cloth designed to maximize screen life and conductance {{as well as to}} provide a consistent cut point. To increase the conductance of a mesh screen you have to minimize the amount of material in the way, this is done by either reducing the wire diameter or weaving the cloth to produce rectangular openings. Rectangular openings increase the screens conductance while minimizing the effect on its cut point where as square openings provide a more consistent cut point but offer a lower conductance.|$|E

50|$|A vacuum {{coffee maker}} brews coffee using two {{chambers}} where vapor pressure and vacuum produce coffee. This type of coffee maker {{is also known as}} vac pot, siphon or syphon coffee maker, and was invented by Loeff of Berlin in the 1830s. These devices have since been used {{for more than a century}} in many parts of the world. Design and composition of the {{vacuum coffee maker}} varies. The chamber material is borosilicate glass, metal, or plastic, and the filter can be either a glass rod or a screen made of <b>metal,</b> <b>cloth,</b> paper, or nylon. The Napier Vacuum Machine, presented in 1840, was an early example of this technique. While vacuum coffee makers generally were excessively complex for everyday use, they were prized for producing a clear brew, and were quite popular until the middle of the twentieth century. The Bauhaus interpretation of this device can be seen in Gerhard Marcks' Sintrax coffee maker of 1925.|$|E

5000|$|In 743, Emperor Shōmu {{issued a}} law in which he stated that the people should become {{directly}} involved {{with the establishment of}} new Buddha temples throughout Japan. His personal belief was that such piety would inspire Buddha to protect his country from further disaster. Gyōki, with his pupils, traveled the provinces asking for donations. According to records kept by Tōdai-ji, more than 2,600,000 people in total helped construct the Great Buddha and its Hall; contributing rice, wood, <b>metal,</b> <b>cloth,</b> or labor; with 350,000 working directly on the statue's construction. The 16 m (52 ft) high statue was built through eight castings over three years, the head and neck being cast together as a separate element. The making of the statue was started first in Shigaraki. After enduring multiple fires and earthquakes, the construction was eventually resumed in Nara in 745, and the Buddha was finally completed in 751. A year later, in 752, the eye-opening ceremony was held with an attendance of 10,000 monks and 4,000 dancers to celebrate the completion of the Buddha. [...] The Indian priest Bodhisena performed the eye-opening for Emperor Shōmu.

5000|$|The United States Air Force (USAF) Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU) was {{designed}} by the U.S. Air Force, which was planning to use the Gemini spacecraft {{as part of the}} Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL). The AMU was a backpack using hydrogen peroxide as the fuel. The total delta-v capability of the AMU was about 250 feet per second (76.2 meters per second), roughly three times that of the MMU. The astronaut would strap on the AMU like a backpack, and maneuver around using two hand controllers like that of the later MMU. Because of the fuel, which came out as a hot gas, the astronaut's suit had to be modified with the addition of woven steel [...] "pants" [...] made of Chromel-R <b>metal</b> <b>cloth.</b> The AMU was carried aboard the Gemini 9 mission, but was not tested because the astronaut, Eugene Cernan, had difficulty maneuvering from the Gemini cabin to the AMU storage place, {{at the back of the}} spacecraft, and overheated, causing his helmet faceplate to fog up. The AMU was also meant to be launched and flown on-board Gemini 12, and to fly untethered from the Gemini spacecraft, but was scrubbed two months before the mission.

40|$|There are {{surprisingly}} many anisotropically reflecting {{objects in the}} real world. Some examples are brushed <b>metal,</b> <b>cloth,</b> CDs, and even many brands of paper. Despite the importance of anisotropic reflections in the real world, most of todays computer graphics systems cannot deal with them appropriately.

In this paper we describe a novel approach for simulating anisotropic reflections on OpenGLbased architectures in real time. The rendering of an anisotropic surface with one light source is exactly as expensive as the rendering of the same surface with traditional texturing and lighting. It is therefore possible in real time, even on low-end workstations and PCs. 1 Introduction Many of the objects we know from day-to-day life have anisotropic surfaces. Oft [...] ...|$|E
40|$|My {{objective}} for my Honors 499 {{project was}} to create three pieces using chain mail for purposes other than the traditional use in armor. The three areas of use I explored are clothing, vessels, and jewelry. I created one finished product from each area, utilizing chain mail as the main techniques. The main materials are silver, copper, and brass for the chain mail, but sheet <b>metal,</b> <b>cloth,</b> stones, etc. were also incorporated into the projects. In creating the chain mail, I explored the different patterns and designs of chain mail to manipulate its appearance in each project. I also saw how chain mail work {{in conjunction with other}} materials. My reason for exploring the uses of chain mail was inspired by the Society For Creative Anachronism, a medieval society that reenacts the lifestyle of the Middle Ages. Their use of chain mail for armor or decorative armor is wonderful, but I wanted to see if I could go beyond that use. My work still has some of the medieval influence, but I also added some modern flavor.

40|$|Advanced sealing {{systems are}} needed to control {{parasitic}} leakage flows to achieve high turbine engine efficiency and low emissions. Typical extreme turbomachinery engine operating conditions when combined with rotor excursions do not lend simple sealing solutions. This work presents an in-depth analysis of a novel robust yet simple sealing system {{that is capable of}} maintaining long life under high speed and high temperature operating conditions. The proposed seal design is actually a gas bearing that is carefully tailored, analyzed, and designed to function as a differential pressure seal. The design involves a simple rigid/semi-flexible seal ring that is attached to a stationary support plate via flexible <b>metal</b> <b>cloth</b> structure. The seal body is capable of moving under the effect of aerodynamic lift force. Therefore, above a certain clearance limit, which ensures that asperity contact is avoided, the seal follows shaft excursions to avoid damaging hard rubs. Applying established working principles for gas lubricated journal bearing, governing Reynolds equation for compressible gas flow is solved using both finite difference and finite element methods. The results of these analyses are validated with other published work in literature. The calculated seal aerodynamic pressure profile is integrated to obtain the lift force. This force is compared to the frictional drag and other resistive forces that need to be overcome to move the seal with rotor during transients. Four different seal designs with varying geometries are studied, and resulting lifting forces are evaluated. It is verified that necessary lifting force for these designs can be obtained without exceeding lower limits of seal clearance. Furthermore, to ensure dynamic stability of the sealing system, natural frequency analyses are conducted. Results from the analysis under typical operating conditions of a gas turbine indicated that seal natural frequencies are well above rotor operating speeds. Finally, leakage analysis of new seal system is performed. Comparison with brush seal leakage performance rates under typical operating conditions reveals that the analyzed seal designs show satisfactory leakage performances that {{are similar to those of}} brush seals...|$|E
