5|$|The {{development}} {{team was}} able to bring Giles Martin aboard as the game's music producer. Martin had recently completed co-production on the 2006 Love project with his father George Martin and was already familiar with the Beatles catalogue. Through that project, Martin created digital back-up copies of all the original tapes, which aided his work on The Beatles: Rock Band. Using audio forensics software, Martin and his team were able to extract the audio of individual instruments by isolating sounds at certain frequencies with digital filters, thus assuring <b>multitrack</b> capabilities for the Beatles' master recordings. This process, conducted at Abbey Road Studio 52 with the help of Paul Hicks and other Abbey Road recording engineers, reportedly took months to complete.|$|E
5|$|A Link Between Worlds {{features}} original music {{along with}} tracks from A Link to the Past. Ryo Nagamatsu composed and orchestrated new music for A Link Between Worlds, {{and played the}} flute music featured in the game's milk bar. He also composed arrangements and adapted Koji Kondo's original music from A Link to the Past. Nagamatsu wanted to balance arrangements of past music with completely new music to please both old and new players. He began by revisiting old tracks and thinking how he could best adapt them for A Link Between Worlds soundtrack. He was eager to include choral performances {{as a way to}} add tension to the eerie and unpleasant scenes in the game. Nagamatsu performed the vocals and made use of <b>multitrack</b> recording to layer the different vocals tracks. The audio team decided not use a live orchestra for recording the game's music, the primary reason for this was to create optimal sound for the Nintendo 3DS. The reverberations and low-pitch sounds created by a live orchestra were not suitable for the Nintendo 3DS speakers. The majority of the string music was created using a synthesizer, with Toru Minegishi playing guitar on one track.|$|E

25|$|A multi-instrumentalist, Stevens {{is known}} for his use of the banjo, but also plays guitar, piano, drums, xylophone, and several other instruments, often playing all of these on his albums through the use of <b>multitrack</b> recording. While in school, he studied the oboe and English horn, which he also plays on his albums. Stevens did not learn to play the guitar until his time at Hope College.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of converter technology transforming analogue signals into digital signals {{has spawned a}} variety of supporting technical developments. DSP or Digital Signal Processing technology has led both to the advent of digital mixing desks and DSP-based computer recording platforms such as Pro Tools. As such, this technology has created both a (typically) cheaper and lower maintenance alternative to the analogue mixing desk and a cheaper alternative to the <b>multitrack</b> analogue tape machine.|$|E
25|$|Brothers in Arms {{was one of}} {{the first}} albums {{directed}} at the CD market, and was a full digital recording (DDD) at a time when most popular music was recorded on analog equipment. It was also released on vinyl (abridged to fit on one LP) and cassette. Producer Neil Dorfsman says the digital <b>multitrack</b> was mixed on an analog board with the resulting two track mix re-digitized via a Prism A/D converter and recorded on a DAT machine.|$|E
50|$|There {{were many}} {{advantages}} of tape recording, {{but the most}} important was that it {{led to the development of}} <b>multitracking.</b> <b>Multitracking</b> occurs when multiple takes of a performance, which were recorded at separate times, are brought together to play simultaneously. This is the method all recording studios use to this day, in order to record all of the separate instruments of a song, and get the best possible takes from all of the musicians.|$|R
50|$|In each part, melodies are introduced, {{usually by}} a single {{instrument}} (viola for women and cello for men), a recording of the spoken phrase from which the melody derives is played. The melody is then developed for a while, with the instruments playing along with the recording of the phrase {{or part of the}} phrase. The music for the strings makes extensive use of paradiddle rhythms, with alternating pitches instead of alternating drum sticking. In addition to speech, the piece includes recordings of train sounds, as well as of sirens and warning bells, and prerecorded multiple lines by the string quartet, thus effectively creating four quartets out of one, reflective of three Counterpoint pieces that preceded it: Vermont Counterpoint for multiple <b>multitracked</b> flutes, New York Counterpoint for multiple <b>multitracked</b> clarinets, and Electric Counterpoint for multiple <b>multitracked</b> electric guitars.|$|R

25|$|Crosby had {{launched}} {{the tape recorder}} revolution in America. In his 1950 film Mr. Music, Crosby is seen singing {{into one of the}} new Ampex tape recorders that reproduced his voice better than anything else. Also quick to adopt tape recording was his friend Bob Hope. He gave one of the first Ampex Model 300 recorders to his friend, musician Les Paul, which led directly to Paul's invention of <b>multitrack</b> recording. His organization, the Crosby Research Foundation, also held various tape recording patents and developed equipment and recording techniques such as the laugh track that are still in use today.|$|E
25|$|Lester William Polsfuss (June 9, 1915 – August 12, 2009), {{known as}} Les Paul, was an American jazz, country, and blues guitarist, songwriter, luthier, and inventor. He {{was one of}} the pioneers of the solid-body {{electric}} guitar. Paul taught himself how to play guitar, and while he is mainly known for jazz and popular music, he had an early career in country music. He is credited with many recording innovations. Although he was not the first to use the technique, his early experiments with overdubbing (also known as sound on sound), delay effects such as tape delay, phasing effects and <b>multitrack</b> recording {{were among the first to}} attract widespread attention.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1994, he {{discovered}} grunge music and would often be absent from school. On New Year's Eve of 1994, Nanao decided to write music, by humming tunes and writing down lyrics, and throughout the next year began writing songs daily. After copying the styles of several bands he enjoyed, Nanao found songwriting a spontaneous activity. In 1996, {{after a year of}} high school, Nanao decided to drop out of high school, and in September took a friend's acoustic guitar and <b>multitrack</b> recorder and moved to Tokyo. In a year's time in 1997, Nanao sent in a demo tape for the Sony Soytzer Music Audition, which led to Nanao being signed to Sony.|$|E

25|$|Re-amping is {{a process}} often used in <b>multitrack</b> {{recording}} in which a recorded signal is routed {{back out of the}} editing environment and run through external processing using effects units and then into a guitar amplifier and a guitar speaker cabinet or a reverb chamber. Originally, the technique was used mostly for electric guitars: it facilitates a separation of guitar playing from guitar amplifier processing—a previously recorded audio program is played back and re-recorded at a later time for the purpose of adding effects, ambiance such as reverb or echo, and the tone shaping imbued by certain amps and cabinets. The technique has since evolved over the 2000s to include many other applications. Re-amping can also be applied to other instruments and program, such as recorded drums, synthesizers, and virtual instruments.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of Pet Sounds, Wilson was using up to six of the eight tracks on the <b>multitrack</b> master {{so that he could}} record the voice of each member separately, {{allowing}} him greater control over the vocal balance in the final mix. After mixing down the four-track to mono for overdubbing via an eight-track recorder, six of the remaining seven tracks were usually dedicated to each of the Beach Boys' vocals. The last track was usually reserved for additional elements such as extra vocals or instrumentation. Vocals were recorded using two Neumann U-47s, which Dennis, Carl and Jardine would sing on, and a Shure 545 used by Brian for his leads. Love sang most of the album's bass vocals, and necessitated an extra microphone due to his low volume range. Some of the vocals were recorded at CBS Columbia Square, {{because it was the only}} facility in Los Angeles with an eight-track recorder.|$|E
500|$|The album's first single, [...] "Survivalism", {{and other}} tracks from Year Zero were {{released}} as <b>multitrack</b> audio files for fans to remix. A remix album titled Year Zero Remixed was later released, containing remixes from Year Zero by other artists. [...] The remix album was Nine Inch Nails' final release {{on a major}} record label for over five years, as the act had completed its contractual obligation to Interscope Records and did not renew its contract. The remix album was accompanied by an interactive remix site with <b>multitrack</b> downloads {{and the ability to}} post remixes.|$|E
50|$|The {{system was}} notably used by Mute Records label head Daniel Miller, who helped produce Depeche Mode's A Broken Frame; and by The Human League (MK1 incarnation). Specifically, the albums Reproduction and Travelogue used a large System 100 (1 x 101, 2 x 102, 2 x 104, 1 x 103) <b>multitracked</b> to provide {{nearly all the}} arrangements, {{including}} drums and percussion. The K2 Plan (Shekhar Raj Dhain) used it extensively in a similar vein, <b>multitracked</b> and with the sequencer providing odd syncopations and effects. Joy Electric's The White Songbook album (2001) was created by using a System 100 exclusively.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, Williamson and {{engineer}} Ed Cherney remixed {{the album}} once {{more from the}} original <b>multitracks.</b> The resulting mixes formed {{a new version of}} the album, released on Bomp! on October 19, 2010.|$|R
