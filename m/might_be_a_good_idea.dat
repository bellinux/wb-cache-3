500|$|In {{the space}} of a week on Tinian, four B-29s crashed and burned on the runway. Parsons became very concerned. If a B-29 [...] crashed with a Little Boy, the fire could cook off the {{explosive}} and detonate the weapon, with catastrophic consequences. He raised the possibility of arming the bomb in flight with Farrell, who agreed that it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea.</b> Farrell asked Parsons if he knew how to perform this task. [...] "No sir, I don't", Parsons conceded, [...] "but I've got all afternoon to learn." [...] The night before the mission, Parsons repeatedly practiced inserting the powder charge and detonator in the bomb in the poor visibility and cramped conditions of the bomb bay.|$|E
500|$|Minear {{initially}} {{had trouble}} conceptualizing his idea, noting that [...] "it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> {{for a short}} story, {{but how do you}} make the whole thing work visually?" [...] To combat this issue, Minear decided to make the remote viewer blind. He sought to make the blind woman [...] "not Audrey Hepburn", a reference to the 1967 film Wait Until Dark, in which Hepburn played the part of an innocent but terrorized blind woman. He later said, [...] "I wanted to make [...] a bitch, because the fact is that disability doesn't necessarily ennoble a person." [...] After several meetings with fellow writers John Shiban, Vince Gilligan, and Frank Spotnitz—who provided storyboard support—Minear was allowed to begin work on the episode.|$|E
500|$|Farrell {{notified}} Groves {{that the}} Little Boy bomb {{would be ready}} for use on or about 3 August, weather permitting. In {{the space of a}} week on Tinian, four B-29s crashed and burned on the runway. Parsons became very concerned. If a B-29 [...] crashed with a Little Boy, the fire could cook off the explosive and detonate the weapon, with catastrophic consequences.

[...] "No sir, I don't", Parsons conceded, [...] "but I've got all afternoon to learn." [...] After the bombing of Hiroshima on 6 August, Farrell, along with Generals Carl Spaatz, Nathan Twining, Barney Giles and James H. Davies, debriefed Parsons, the aircrews and the observers, and sent Groves a detailed report.|$|E

500|$|Tom Carson, {{television}} {{critic for}} The Village Voice, praised the episode, {{which he said}} [...] "featured some amazing sick jokes about American affluence and obliviousness". Dianne Williamson of the Telegram & Gazette praised [...] "Starvin' Marvin" [...] for taking a chance with the source material, and said, [...] "Often I'm in awe at the courage of these [...] creators." [...] The Advertiser of Lafayette, Louisiana, called the episode [...] "hysterical" [...] and particularly praised its satire of American consumerism. The St. Paul Pioneer Press described the episode as [...] "hilarious" [...] and said, [...] "We know we shouldn't laugh, but we can't help it." [...] Vicki Englund of The Courier-Mail complimented the [...] "really bizarre storyline" [...] and {{the moral of the}} episode, and especially praised the jokes about Struthers: [...] "It <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> not to eat during the hilarious second episode. Enough said." ...|$|E
500|$|Lytle later noted, [...] "It was {{actually}} Jim 's fault. He {{suggested that we}} consider playing some shows, and I went, 'No', [...] he convinced me it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea.</b> We talked {{about it for a}} little while. I didn't think anyone else in the band would be into it, [...] he checked around and it turns out they were all enthusiastic. I think I was the last one to say yes.... I {{was actually}} blown away that they even wanted to. Once I found that out, I said 'OK, let's start doing the work, figure out how to play the songs.' The weird moment was when he had the first rehearsal; I had no idea how it was going to turn out. After five days of playing together it actually sounded really good. It was too easy, and we were actually really having a good time together." ...|$|E
500|$|A link {{developed}} during the war with the King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC), whose Southern Rhodesian contingent—numbering a few hundred, chiefly in its 2nd and 3rd Battalions—was the largest on the Western Front. The connection with this particular corps began {{as the result of}} a chance conversation aboard the ship that took the first batch of Southern Rhodesians from Cape Town to Southampton in late 1914. The 16th Marquess of Winchester, who had links with Rhodesia dating back to the 1890s, was also aboard the ship, returning from a visit to the colony. Encountering Captain John Banks Brady, the officer of Irish origin who led the volunteers, the Marquess asked where his party was headed. Brady enthusiastically replied that they were going to war together in France. The Marquess suggested to Brady that since it might be difficult to prevent his men from being split up during the enlistment process, it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> for the Rhodesians to join the KRRC, where he could keep an eye on them through his connections with the Winchester-based regiment. The Southern Rhodesian contingent duly mustered into the KRRC. A designated Rhodesian platoon, widely referred to thereafter as [...] "the Rhodesian Platoon", was formed under Brady at the KRRC training camp at Sheerness, on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent.|$|E

500|$|To {{spread his}} costs over more magazines, Silberkleit soon decided to launch two {{additional}} titles. [...] In November 1939 {{the first issue}} of Future Fiction appeared; it was followed in July 1940 by Science Fiction Quarterly. [...] Hornig was editor for all three of the magazines. [...] In October 1940, Hornig, who was a pacifist, received his military call-up. [...] He decided to move to California and register as a conscientious objector; he continued to edit the magazines from the west coast, but Silberkleit was unhappy with the arrangement. [...] Silberkleit allowed Hornig to retain his post as editor of Science Fiction, and offered the editorship of the other two titles to Sam Moskowitz. [...] Moskowitz declined, saying afterwards that he [...] "would never strike at a man's job", but Donald Wollheim, a member of a group of aspiring writers called the Futurians, heard about the offer. [...] Wollheim told Robert W. Lowndes, another member of the Futurians, about the opening, and urged him to write to Silberkleit. [...] Lowndes later recalled Wollheim's idea: [...] "In the letter, I'd suggest that it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> to add a science fiction title to the list, offering my services as editor at a slightly lower price than Hornig was being paid, and also find fault with all the other sf titles presently out, but particularly with Hornig's". [...] Lowndes relates that Silberkleit took the bait and hired him in November 1940; Hornig recalls the separation as being by mutual consent because of his move to California. [...] Lowndes subsequently agreed that this was likely to be the real reason Silberkleit replaced Hornig.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} spread his costs over more magazines, Silberkleit soon decided to launch two {{additional}} titles. [...] When {{he had worked}} for Gernsback, Silberkleit had suggested [...] "Future Fiction" [...] as a possible title for the magazine Gernsback was planning to launch. [...] Gernsback eventually chose [...] "Amazing Stories" [...] instead, and Silberkleit now decided to use his original suggestion {{for one of the}} new magazines. [...] In November 1939 the first issue of Future Fiction appeared; it was followed in July 1940 by Science Fiction Quarterly. [...] Hornig was editor for all three magazines. [...] In October 1940, Hornig received his military draft notice; he was a pacifist, and decided to move to California and register as a conscientious objector. [...] He continued to edit the magazines from the west coast, but Silberkleit was unhappy with the arrangement.

[...] Lowndes relates that Silberkleit took the bait and hired him in November 1940; Hornig recalls the separation as being by mutual consent because of his move to California. [...] Lowndes subsequently agreed that this was likely to be the real reason Silberkleit replaced Hornig. [...] The first issues Lowndes was responsible for were the Spring 1941 issue of Science Fiction Quarterly and the April 1941 issue of Future Fiction. [...] He completed the preparations for the last issue of Science Fiction, dated September 1941, but he used material that Hornig had already selected for the article, with minor exceptions. [...] The changes included the replacement of Fantasy Times, a fan department by James Taurasi, with Futurian Times, a similar department from a rival group of fans, the Futurians, to which Lowndes belonged. [...] Initially Silberkleit kept tighter control on Lowndes' editorial selections than he had on Hornig's, vetoing five of the seven stories Lowndes proposed for the April 1941 Future, but by the August 1941 issue, Lowndes later recalled, Silberkleit [...] "was satisfied that I knew what I was doing, and... didn't need to oversee any story I had accepted".|$|E
2500|$|I know it may smack of [...] "enabling" [...] to rabidly anti-smoking Californians, but if {{we really}} want to keep the streets clean of this noxious litter, it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> to give smokers (including many foreign tourists) a safe and handy place to dispose of their used cigarettes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{play was}} {{eventually}} adapted {{for a film}} released in February 1990, with screenplay and direction by Stoppard. [...] The motion picture is Stoppard's only film directing credit: [...] "t began to become clear that it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> if I did it myself—at least the director wouldn't have to keep wondering what the author meant. It just seemed that I'd {{be the only person}} who could treat the play with the necessary disrespect." [...] The cast included Gary Oldman as Rosencrantz, Tim Roth as Guildenstern, Richard Dreyfuss as the Player, Joanna Roth as Ophelia, Ian Richardson as Polonius, Joanna Miles as Gertrude, Donald Sumpter as Claudius, and Iain Glen as Hamlet.|$|E
2500|$|Although Beckett {{refused to}} be drawn on the {{backgrounds}} of the characters, this has not stopped actors looking for their own motivation. Jean Martin had a doctor friend called Marthe Gautier, who {{was working at the}} Salpêtrière Hospital, and he said to her: [...] "'Listen, Marthe, what could I find that would provide some kind of physiological explanation for a voice like the one written in the text?' [...] said: 'Well, it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> if you went to see the people who have Parkinson's disease.' So I asked her about the disease ... She explained how it begins with a trembling, which gets more and more noticeable, until later the patient can no longer speak without the voice shaking. So I said, 'That sounds exactly what I need.'" [...] "Sam and Roger were not entirely convinced by my interpretation but had no objections." [...] When he explained to Beckett that he was playing Lucky as if he were suffering from Parkinson's, Beckett said, [...] "'Yes, of course.' He mentioned briefly that his mother had had Parkinson's, but quickly moved on to another subject." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1967, in his {{capacity}} as a military adviser Dyson wrote an influential paper on the issue of possible US use of tactical nuclear weapons in the Vietnam War. When a general said in a meeting, [...] "I think it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> to throw in a nuke now and then, just to keep the other side guessing..." [...] Dyson became alarmed and obtained permission to write an objective report discussing {{the pros and cons of}} using such weapons from a purely military point of view. (This report, Tactical Nuclear Weapons in Southeast Asia, published by the Institute for Defense Analyses, was obtained, with some redactions, by the Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability under the Freedom of Information act in 2002.) It was sufficiently objective that both sides in the debate based their arguments on it. Dyson says that the report showed that, even from a narrow military point of view, the US was better off not using nuclear weapons. Dyson stated on the Dick Cavett show that the use of nuclear weaponry was a bad idea for the US at the time because [...] "our targets were large and theirs were small." [...] (His unstated assumption was that the Soviets would respond by supplying tactical nukes to the other side.) ...|$|E
