In his fourth fight on 5 December 2007, he defeated Craig Tomes by way of knock-out after just 1 minute and 57 seconds, landing a left hook that unsettled Tomes as the referee decided his opponent as unfit to continue. Matt Seawright was Woodhouse's next boxing opponent on 16 March 208, he defeated him after Seawright felt {{he was unable to}} continue after the third round. Woodhouse finished the 2007–08 football season having played in 29 Conference National matches, scoring once and receiving two red cards.

25|$|Producers will {{typically}} {{continue to}} milk the cow until she is two <b>months</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> parturition {{then they will}} dry her off. Giving the cow a break during {{the final stages of}} pregnancy allows her mammary gland to regress and re-develop, her body condition to recover, and the calf to develop normally. Decreased body condition in the cow means she will not be as productive in subsequent milk cycles. Decreased health in the new born calf will negatively impact the quality of the replacement herd. There is also evidence that increased rates of mammary cell proliferation occur during the dry period that is essential to maintaining high production levels in subsequent lactation cycles.|$|E
25|$|The {{duration}} of the visible blistering caused by varicella zoster virus varies in children usually from 4 to 7 days, {{and the appearance of}} new blisters begins to subside after the fifth day.

It is recommended to keep new infants from birth up to age 6 <b>months</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> an infected person for 10 to 21 days because their immune systems are not developed enough to handle the stress it can bring on. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is widely used to reduce fever. Aspirin, or products containing aspirin, should not be given to children with chickenpox, as it can cause Reye's Syndrome.|$|E

25|$|In July 1982, {{after the}} Falklands War fiasco brought more {{moderate}} leadership {{to the military}} dictatorship, Cavallo was appointed president of the Central Bank. He inherited the country's most acute financial and economic crisis since 1930, and a particularly heinous Central Bank regulation painfully remembered as the Central Bank Circular 1050. Implemented in 1980 {{at the behest of}} conservative Economy Minister José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz, the policy tied adjustable loan installments (nearly all lending in Argentina is on an adjustable interest basis) to the value of the US Dollar locally. Exchange rates were controlled at the time and therefore raised little concern. The next February, however, the peso was sharply devalued and continued to plummet for the rest of 1981 and into 1982. Mortgage and business borrowers saw their monthly installments increase over tenfold in just a year and many, including homeowners just <b>months</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> paying off their loans, unable to keep up, either lost their entire equity (see, negative amortization) or everything outright.|$|E

On July 2 Von Eerie and her Legión stablemate Alex Koslov defeated Faby Apache and Aero Star to win the AAA World Mixed Tag Team Championship. This started a storyline, where Koslov {{fell in love with}} Von Eerie, who, however, didn't share his emotions. On July 29 Von Eerie and Blade defeated the Apaches in a lumberjack strap match. On August 14 at Verano de Escandalo Von Eerie, Koslov and Sexy Star faced the Apaches and Aero Star in a match, where both Von Eerie's and Koslov's World Mixed Tag Team Championship and Sexy Star's Reina de Reinas Championship were on the line. The match ended with Mari Apache pinning Sexy Star, which meant that she lost her title, while Von Eerie and Koslov kept theirs. At the following major event, Héroes Inmortales IV on October 1, Von Eerie and Koslov lost the World Mixed Tag Team Championship to Faby Apache and her new tag team partner Pimpinela Escarlata.|$|E
25|$|FLOC {{was founded}} in September 1967 by Baldemar Velásquez and his father. Velásquez had been deeply {{influenced}} by the ideas of César Chávez, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Initially, his goal was merely to organize the farmworkers {{so that they could}} cooperate with the growers to improve pay, housing, and education for the pickers. Sensing that the farmworkers would not take a 20-year-old student seriously, Velásquez relied on his father to gather the employees and get them to listen to him. He even sent volunteer organizers to Texas during the winter to talk to and organize the workers during their <b>months</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> work. But the effort largely failed, and in September 1968 Velásquez called a strike against 10 tomato growers in Ohio. Five growers signed contracts recognizing the union, agreeing to a minimum wage and limited health insurance, and promising not to discriminate against union members or union organizers. Within a few weeks, 21 other growers had agreed to contracts with FLOC as well. But in the following year, sustained anti-union opposition from the growers (backed by the American Farm Bureau Federation), the withdrawal of some growers from the tomato market, the refusal of some growers to honor their contracts, and the efforts of some growers to raise wages and improve working conditions (which led employees to abandon the union) caused Velásquez to rethink his organizing strategy.|$|E
