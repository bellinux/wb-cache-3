40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the control and design of an {{intelligent}} agricultural robot. Robotic melon harvesting has been undertaken as a case study. ^ An intelligent control structure for a robot performing in the uncertain, unknown and ill-structured agricultural domain was modeled as distributed, autonomous computing modules which communicated through a global accessible blackboard structure. The proposed control architecture was tested and verified by simulating all stages of the data flow for the robotic melon harvester: from sensory input, through transformation to information, planning of tasks, and execution of tasks and modification for dynamic conditions. A CAD workstation was used to plan, model, simulate and evaluate the robot 2 ̆ 7 s motions based on simulated real-time sensory input. ^ Performance of the robotic system (i. e., cycle time and percentage of successful cycles) was evaluated by developing simulation models that determined {{the effect of the}} many closely related robot design parameters (e. g., number of arms; operational mode; i. e. serial, parallel; actuator speeds and accelerations) and horticultural practices (fruit distribution). Initially design alternatives were evaluated using animated, visual simulation which provided insight into the complex interaction between the different system components. Dynamic, numerical simulation tools were then developed to quantify the many closely related design parameters for varying cultural practices. An algorithm, based on the traveling salesman problem, was developed to determine the most time efficient robot for a two dimensional task. Simulations revealed the sensitivity of the robot 2 ̆ 7 s design parameters (operational mode, number of arms, actuator speeds, frame size, and picking time) and horticultural practices (planting distance) on the performance of the robotic <b>melon</b> <b>harvester.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|A {{machine vision}} {{system for a}} robotic <b>melon</b> <b>harvester</b> has been developed. The {{harvesting}} strategy and diverse field parameters have been analyzed, the image acquisition strategies designed, and {{the operation of the}} machine vision and image processing architecture developed. The architecture consists of three major components: the global frame analysis, the knowledge-directed evaluation, and the goal-oriented approach. ^ The global frame analysis captures images of a melon bed section in its full width and identifies the melons in the image area. The knowledge-directed evaluation utilized the image parameters and the detection coordinates to separate multiple and error detections from correct melon detections. The goal-oriented approach guides the robotic manipulator during its approach toward the melon. Images are acquired and processed and the robotic controller provided with information about the distance to the melon and about deviations from the correct approach trajectory. ^ Software prototypes have been developed on a Silicon Graphics Personal Iris for testing each level. The global analysis produces a large number of potential melons. The knowledge-based module then utilizes a database and a set of rules to reduce the list of possible melons to a high level of accuracy. The goal-oriented module then utilizes a triangulation algorithm to determine the distance to the melon and to identify an off-centered robotic approach. The system has been tested with field images of the melon beds generated under natural illumination conditions. ^ The global frame analysis showed a detection performance of 86. 5 % to 89 % detection accuracy (percentage of detected melons) under environmental conditions ranging from direct sunlight to clouded and dark illuminations. The images were acquired without artificial lighting or unnatural background. The disadvantage of this component was its low detection correctness. A high number of error detections and multiple detections of one melon were generated and would have reduced the efficiency of harvesting if not eliminated. The knowledge-directed evaluation eliminated over 90 % of the error and multiple detections without significantly reducing the detection accuracy. ^ The results show the applicability of machine vision and image processing to the melon harvesting operation and the feasibility of the proposed approach. The utilization of domain knowledge to evaluate the detection results of the conventional image processing software showed the potential of knowledge concepts in this domain. The goal-oriented sensing is required to support the robot operation in a natural environment. The concept was tested and showed its potential. ...|$|E
