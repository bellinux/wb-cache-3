40|$|Purpose: The {{objectives}} of this thesis were {{to compare the}} clinical and material performance of implant-supported titanium frameworks with gold-alloy frameworks in the edentulous jaw and to test a digitized impression technique to optimize material characteristics and clinical and laboratory procedures. Materials and Methods: Two different kinds of laser-welded titanium frameworks and one type of digitized computer numeric controlled (CNC) -milled titanium framework for the edentulous jaw were evaluated and compared with gold-alloy frameworks in two clinical 5 -year follow-up studies. The CNC frameworks were also evaluated and compared with gold-alloy frameworks in two experimental studies according to fit, preload, and surface roughness. Furthermore, a digitized photogrammetric technique for recording implant positions in the edentulous jaw was experimentally tested and compared with two conventional impression techniques. Results: Laser-welded titanium frameworks had a lower success rate after 5 years in function than gold-alloy frameworks. The 5 -year performance of CNC frameworks {{was similar to that}} of gold-alloy frameworks. The fit and precision of implant-supported CNC frameworks was significantly better compared with gold-alloy frameworks. Applications of veneering material did not significantly affect the fit of the titanium frameworks. The preload of CNC frameworks was similar to that of gold-alloy frameworks, both exhibiting significantly decreased preloads after repeated tightening. The preloads of titanium frameworks were similar before and after veneering. Unloaded <b>milled</b> titanium <b>screw</b> sites had significantly rougher surfaces than loaded sites, and loaded gold screws had rougher surfaces than unloaded. No correlation between surface of the screw joints and preload of veneered titanium frameworks was observed. The precision of photogrammetric impressions was comparable to that of conventional impression techniques. Conclusions: Implant-supported CNC-milled titanium frameworks are a viable alternative to gold-alloy castings in the edentulous jaw, and because a digital platform is used to manufacture these titanium frameworks, photogrammetric impressions can be made...|$|R
40|$|Current {{market trends}} are moving from large {{quantity}} production towards small batch production and mass customization. This {{has led to}} the high demand for the flexibility and adaptability of manufacturing technology and systems. Several reconfigurable pin type tooling systems have been proposed and developed to satisfy such demands. However, these reconfigurable tooling systems still suffer from several drawbacks, including difficulties associated with positioning and locking the pins and problems of uneven “staircase” surface effects from relying on discrete finite size pins. The main focus of this research is on building a hybrid vacuum-forming machine system (HAVES) based on reconfigurable screw-pin tooling (SPT) as a test bed for understanding the processes involved in developing this technology and to examine the feasibility of implementing such technology in an industrial system. The SPT used is composed of identical screw pins,which are engaged with each other in an array pattern. By adjusting vertical displacement of the screw pins, a wide variety of component geometry can be formed. The adjustment methodology of the SPT is formulated mathematically in order to help construction of the SPT be parametrical thus enabling automatic CNC G-code generation. The HAVES test bed development involves full machine design and hardware and software integration. The hardware integration task included a CNC controller, drive motors, encoders, <b>milling</b> and <b>screw</b> adjustment heads, SPT, vacuum forming system. The software integration task involved the processing of three-dimensional CAD geometry to automatically generate post processed G codes in order to adjust the screw-pin to the required component geometry and subsequent surface machining for driving the final die geometry and minimize operator intervention. The completed HAVES test bed has been tested for accuracy, repeatability and functionalities with quality good results. An economic analysis has been also conducted to verify the economic feasibility of the HAVES test bed by comparing the cost of making vacuum forming components using a dedicated mould versus using the HAVES test bed.

40|$|A simple refiner control {{strategy}} aimed at minimizing variations in freeness of an ultra-high-yield sulfite (UHYS) pulp has been implemented in a newsprint <b>mill.</b> The feeder <b>screw</b> speed is being manipulated {{to compensate for}} variations in the bulk density of the chip feed and to maintain a constant motor load at the primary refiners. This ensures a more constant mass flow rate through the primary refiners, which translates into a more constant primary specific energy. This {{has resulted in a}} reduction in motor load fluctuations of about 60 % and a reduction in freeness variations of 40 %. The final pulp freeness is regulated by manipulating the plate gap of the secondary refiners using on-line freeness measurements made at the outlet of the latency chest. Control of the secondary plate gap has led to an additional 30 % reduction of the variation in freeness. This two-stage refining {{control strategy}} has reduced the 2 -sigma confidence interval for variation in pulp freeness from 48 mL to less than 14 mL, a reduction of more than 70 %. The complete strategy has reduced the average refiner energy consumption per ton of pulp by 3. 5 % and has increased the average paper machine production by 2. 5 % by reducing the number of paper breaks. In addition, the strategy has compensated for changes in cooking conditions and their effect on the refining properties of the chips...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This {{bibliographical review}} aims to {{determine}} the present situation of the implant-supported milled bar overdenture as a therapeutic option in implantology, {{as well as to}} set and compare the techniques and materials currently used for making them. Materials and methods: By searching the main electronic bibliographical data in indexed Medline articles, we obtained a total number of 20 articles that fulfilled the requirements of this bibliographical review. Results: The implant-supported milled bar overdenture offers excellent long-term successful results, although complication rates are higher in emergency cases of patients initially planned for a fixed prosthesis. Krenmair and collaborators found cumulative survival rates of implants on milled bars after 5 years, of 99 % in mandible cases, and of 97. 8 % in maxilla cases. No detailed protocols specifying the necessary number of implants or their characteristics have been found, though they are never made with less than 4 implants in mandible or 4 - 6 in the maxilla. <b>Milled</b> bars are <b>screwed,</b> generally cast in a precious metal alloy, with a metal or acrylic suprastructure and include attachments that regulate the tightness. The suprastructure adjusts precisely and rigidly to the milled bar, and presents similar biomechanical movements to those of fixed prostheses. The overdenture is removable and its prophylaxis is simple. Conclusions: The implant supported milled bar overdenture is a very interesting option in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe reabsorbed maxilla problems. It offers both the advantages of removable prostheses as well as the stability and retention of a fixed prosthesis...|$|R
40|$|The project ”Investment {{proposal}} for grinding station for service work of screw feeders” has been performed {{during the spring}} semester 2014 for the course Bachelor’s thesis for degree of  Bachelor of science in machine engineering at Karlstad’s University. The project has been performed in cooperation with Fiber Workshop which is a service department in the company Valmet AB. Valmet AB {{is a company that}} develops and manufacture soft paper tissue machines. The screw feeder is a part that is used to feed, and squeeze out the water out of woodchips. The service work of the screw feeder mostly consists of service work on two major parts, namely the feeder screw and the split pipe, which the feeder screw is mounted in.   The purpose of the project was to evaluate the service work, namely the grinding in a working environment point of view. Another goal of the project was to present some improvements for this process.   The working environment which has been evaluated is primarily the risk of vibration damage in arm and hand, the risk of ergonomic musculoskeletal disorders and even a dust measurement has been performed, with the help of Hans-Olov Karlsson from the company Clarahälsan. The result from the working environment survey suggests that the operator exceed the work environment limits in regards to the risk of suffering damages from vibrations in the hand and arm. The grinding work of the split pipe {{is considered to be a}} bigger problem in regards to ergonomics than the grinding on the feeder screw. The split pipe requires the operator to stand in a posture that takes more concentration and precision than for the feeder screw. The results from the dust measurements indicate that the levels of dust in the air, during the grinding, are within the approved limits. The safety equipment used by the operator is adequate, there has however been a desire of the client to find a solution that manages the dust.   One of the improvement proposals consists mainly of a number of accessories for the grinder to help improve the problems with vibration and the dust. The possibilities to circumvent the grinding work for the screw pipe altogether have been examined. It is possible to begin to <b>mill</b> the <b>screw</b> pipe in the lathe, which has a powered tool. For it to be possible to mill the split pipe instead of grinding, the lathe machine is in need of an extension arm, to be able to reach down the whole split pipe. This arm has been designed and developed in this project...|$|R
