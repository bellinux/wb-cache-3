40|$|Amygdala {{kindling}} is {{a widely}} used animal model to study network changes during mesial temporal lobe epileptogenesis. The aim {{of the current study}} was to study the effective connectivity in fully kindled macaques using electrical microstimulation during fMRI. Two rhesus monkeys were implanted with low impedance electrodes in the right amygdala. Electrical kindling consisted of daily stimulation with a 1 second, 60 Hz sine wave at the intensity of the afterdischarge threshold (500 μA <b>monkey</b> <b>S,</b> 1100 μA <b>monkey</b> K). Monkeys were considered fully kindled when they showed stable stage 4 seizures (bilateral tonicclonic movements), which was after 515 days of electrical kindling in <b>monkey</b> <b>S</b> and 477 days in monkey K. When fully kindled, the monkeys were injected with a contrast agent and scanned at a 3 T Siemens MR scanner with an 8 -channel phased-array coil under ketamine/medetomidine sedation. The fMRI protocol consisted of interleaved stimulation and no-stimulation blocks. During stimulation blocks, the amygdala was stimulated with a squared bipolar pulse (pulse width 0. 48 ms, frequency 200 Hz, duration 250 ms, intensity 800 - 1000 μA) every 2500 ms. No seizures were evoked during fMRI microstimulation. Electrical microstimulation of the kindling site in the amygdala during fMRI revealed extensive fMRI activations in cortical and subcortical structures in both <b>monkeys.</b> In <b>monkey</b> <b>S,</b> we observed strong significant activations in the ipsilateral putamen, thalamus, somatosensory cortex, early visual areas and in the contralateral cerebellum. In monkey K, the main activations were observed in the contralateral amygdala, claustrum, thalamus, superior temporal sulcus and the cerebellum. A conjunction analysis of the two monkeys (at a threshold of p< 0. 01 uncorrected for each monkey) revealed common fMRI activations in the contralateral amygdala, pallidum, thalamus and cerebellum. Therefore, the amygdala in stage 4 kindled monkeys is connected to extensive, bilateral networks of cortical and subcortical structures. These networks were distinct but partially overlapping in the two animals. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Capuchin monkeys (Sapajus spp.) in captive {{settings}} frequently manipulate {{and throw}} objects. In the wild, they may push or drop stones and sticks toward targets during inter- or intraspecific threat displays. In addition, female capuchin monkeys exhibit a broad repertoire of behaviors during their proceptive period, including facial expressions, vocalizations, stereotyped body postures, and touch-and-run behavior. This study reports stone throwing as a newly-described communicative behavior during the proceptive display of females {{in a group}} of bearded capuchin <b>monkeys</b> (<b>S.</b> libidinosus) in Serra da Capivara National Park, Brazil. During a two-year study, three females from one group were seen throwing stones at males during their proceptive phase.

40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that the {{administration}} of as little as 1 gm. of sulfanilamide by mouth will completely eradicate both acute and chronic Plasmodium knowlesi infections in rhesus monkeys (1). The evidence of cure in these cases was: (a) the permanent disappearance of parasites from the circulating blood; (b) the failure to reproduce the infection in normal <b>monkey</b> <b>s</b> by the subinoculation of fresh blood from treated animals; (c) the failure of treated monkeys to relapse following splenectomy; and (d) the successful reinfection of treated monkeys with the homologous parasite. These findings were of special interest because untreated P. knowlesi malaria in monkeys is an infection that is almost invariably fatal, and in this respect it represents one of the most virulent malaria infections in either human beings or experimental animals. On the other hand, it has been the experience in this laboratory, as well as of most other workers, that sulfanilamide is an inferior therapeutic agent in human malaria (2 - 4). The drug has also failed to exert any demonstrable influence, even with excessive doses, in canaries and chicks infected with Plasmodium cathemerium and Plasmodium lophurae, respectively (5). From the above mentioned findings it has been impossible to determine whether the activity of the drug varied from host to host, or whether it exerted its influence according to the species of plasmodium encountered.

In an attempt to redefine the contested genre of the ethnic bildungsroman, this study analyzes three novels by Asian American and Asian Canadian female authors: Cecilia Manguerra Brainard 2 ̆ 7 s When the Rainbow Goddess Wept (1991), Joy Kogawa 2 ̆ 7 s Obasan (1981), and Lan Cao 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Monkey</b> Bridge (1997). Each of these novels is an ethnic bildungsroman that highlights the identity formation of a female protagonist {{in the midst of}} historical trauma. This study focuses on the ways in which these texts resist the conventions of the European bildungsroman through the factors of myth, dreams, and historical trauma. While Philippine folklore is the vehicle through which protagonist Yvonne matures in Brainard 2 ̆ 7 s When the Rainbow Goddess Wept, dreams and childhood tales in Kogawa 2 ̆ 7 s Obasan enable protagonist Naomi to develop and reconnect with her lost mother. Similarly, in Cao 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Monkey</b> Bridge, protagonist Mai uses the Vietnamese legend of the Trung sisters to develop a transnational identity and reconnect with her mother and motherland. In all three of these novels, myths and dreams function as alternative spaces of development that interrupt the immediate trauma of the texts. Myth, dreams, and trauma are thus integral to the project of redefining the Asian North American female bildungsroman...|$|R
40|$|Background: Numerous {{studies in}} human and {{non-human}} primates {{have shown that}} merely observing other's actions can modulate activity in the observer's motor cortices. Similar automatic responses have also been suggested in human somatosensory cortices when actions involving touch are observed, with some studies suggesting an involvement of primary S 1 (Pihko et al., 2010) and/or secondary S 2 somatosensory regions (Keysers et al., 2004), while others emphasize the involvement of more posterior parietal regions (Chan and Baker, 2015). Methods: Here we investigated brain responses during grasp or mere touch observation using contrast-enhanced functional MRI (Siemens 3 Tesla) in monkeys. We first localized hand representations of S 1 and S 2 in three macaques (male, 4 - 6 kg) by stimulating the hand region with a brush in anaesthetized fMRI scans. In subsequent awake experiments, we scanned these monkeys while they observed videos of various actions displaying different instances of touch (grasping or simple touching of objects or hands). Control videos depicted the same actors performing reaching movements towards the same objects/hands without interacting with them. In an additional experiment, videos of different actions (grasp and touch) towards a hand displaying obvious skin displacements (Ferri et al., 2015) were also presented. Results: A region-of-interest analysis of S 1 and S 2 hand regions responding during passive tactile stimulation did not yield significant fMRI signal increases during either grasp or touch observation (compared to controls), nor did observing actions showing obvious skin displacements. Posterior parietal regions, including AIP and PFG, as well as premotor F 5, in addition to early visual and STS regions, showed significant responses during observation of both grasp and mere touch (compared to controls). Interestingly, a more anterior S 2 sector, that mainly responds during monkeys' active hand manipulation tasks like grasp execution (Nelissen and Vanduffel., 2011; Ishida et al., 2013), showed consistent responses during touch observation, particular those actions involving a grasp. Conclusion: Our results suggest that somatosensory sectors of <b>monkey</b> <b>S</b> 1 and S 2 that respond significantly during passive tactile stimulation do not show modulations during grasp and touch observation. However, a more anterior portion of S 2 responds during touch observation. These observations {{are in line with}} recent evidence of single-cell responses in macaque S 2 during human action observation (Hihara et al., 2015).

However, HIV- 1 does not infect most non-human primates because of species-specific host restriction factors and/or {{inability of the}} receptor for HIV- 1, the CD 4 proteins, to function efficiently as HIV- 1 receptors for viral entry. This study aimed to determine if owl monkey species encode CD 4 receptors and CCR 5 coreceptors that support cellular entry by variants representing transmitted, circulating forms of HIV- 1. The functionality of owl <b>monkey</b> CD 4 <b>s</b> as receptors and CCR 5 s as coreceptors was evaluated using infectivity assays with HIV- 1 pseudotyped with envelope protein. Here, we have identified owl <b>monkey</b> CD 4 <b>s</b> that naturally function as receptors for HIV- 1 entry and our data corroborate previous findings that N 39 in the D 1 domain of CD 4 is important for usage as a receptor by transmitted HIV- 1 envelope variants. Additionally, we have mapped residues in CCR 5 necessary for transmitted HIV- 1 envelope variant entry into cells. Two amino acid residues in CCR 5, Y 15 and T 16, {{were found to be}} sufficient to support HIV- 1 entry into cells for some, but not all, envelope variants tested. This research will assist in identifying new non-human primate models of HIV- 1 infection that can support replication of transmitted forms of HIV- 1 variants (and/or SHIVs) that are relevant for vaccine and therapeutic approaches...|$|R

Histochemically, such a compound has also been demonstrated in the chief and pyloric cells of the cat and in mucous neck cells of the <b>monkey.</b> © 1969 <b>S.</b> Karger AG, Basel.

5000|$|An {{experiment}} on capuchin <b>monkeys</b> (Brosnan, <b>S</b> and de Waal, F) {{showed that the}} subjects would prefer receiving nothing to receiving a reward awarded inequitably {{in favor of a}} second monkey, and appeared to target their anger at the researchers responsible for the inequitable distribution of food. Anthropologists suggest that this research indicates a biological and evolutionary sense of social [...] "fair play" [...] in primates, though others believe that this is learned behavior or explained by other mechanisms. There is also evidence for inequity aversion in chimpanzees (though see a recent study questioning this interpretation). The latest study shows that chimpanzees play the Ultimatum Game {{in the same way as}} children, preferring equitable outcomes. The authors claim that we now are near the point of no difference between humans and apes with regard to a sense of fairness. Recent studies suggest that animals in the canidae family also recognize a basic level of fairness, stemming from living in cooperative societies. Animal cognition studies in other biological orders have not found similar importance on relative [...] "equity" [...] and [...] "justice" [...] as opposed to absolute utility.|$|R
40|$|Epilepsy is {{a chronic}} {{neurological}} disorder that {{is characterized by}} recurrent manifestations of epileptic seizures. This disorder is controlled, but not cured, by antiepileptic drugs in about 70 % of patients. Therefore, {{there is still a}} need for new therapies. Ideally, preventing epilepsy to manifest in patients at risk would be a major achievement. Therefore, we need to know how a healthy brain transforms into an epileptic brain, a process that is called epileptogenesis. The objective of this thesis was to study functional network changes during temporal lobe epileptogenesis. To reach this goal we applied the amygdala kindling model in the macaque monkey (Macaca mulatta) and performed structural MRI and four types of functional nuclear imaging techniques during kindling epileptogenesis. We imaged (1) ictal brain perfusion using 99 mTc-ECD SPECT; (2) interictal brain metabolism using [18 F]-FDG µPET; (3) interictal cannabinoid type 1 receptor expression using [18 F]-MK- 9470 µPET and (4) interictal GABAA receptor expression using [11 C]-FMZ µPET. When the monkeys reached stable stage IV seizures, i. e. when they were fully kindled, we studied effective connectivity of the kindled amygdala using electrical microstimulation during fMRI (EM-fMRI). Finally, we performed a short pilot study of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in two imaging-defined targets in order to perturb seizure activity. In the first research chapter (chapter 3), we described the progression of the amygdala kindling model in terms of seizure duration, seizure semiology and perfusion changes. Similar to Wada and colleagues, who were the first to systematically describe the electroclinical changes in the rhesus monkey amygdala kindling model, we found a very slow progression in afterdischarge duration (ADD). We applied daily electrical stimulation in order to elicit a seizure for 477 days in monkey K. and 515 days in <b>monkey</b> <b>S.</b> During this period, ADD ranged from on average 18 s in the first clinical stage to 52 s in the last clinical stage. Four different clinical stages in the rhesus monkey during amygdala kindling were defined by Wada and colleagues. We followed this categorization of seizures based on their semiology. Stage I was defined as interruption of ongoing behavior; stage II seizures were characterized by oral automatisms; stage III by unilateral dystonic and clonic movements and stage IV as secondarily generalized seizures with bilateral dystonic and clonic movements. In each of these four stages, we imaged the cerebral perfusion during a seizure using ictal SPECT imaging. Therefore, we injected the radiotracer 99 mTc-ECD immediately before evoking a seizure. The uptake of the radiotracer reflects then the perfusion distribution during {{the first part of the}} seizure. By subtracting the perfusion distribution in the baseline state, we could measure the seizure specific increases and decreases in perfusion. From the early stage I on, we observed a distributed pattern of regions of hyper- and hypoperfusion in cortical and subcortical structures. Combining the perfusion changes from the four stages, we defined for each monkey a ‘common network’, i. e. the perfusion changes that are present in every seizure stage. Over time, we saw that most perfusion changes arose from this common network. In chapter 4, we described the preliminary results of our PET experiments. Besides ictal perfusion, we were interested in investigating interictal changes in brain metabolism, CB 1 R and GABAA receptor expression in our monkey kindling model. So far, we can only draw conclusions about the last stage of kindling. Despite a large intersubject variability in our baseline group (n= 8), we observed significant changes in cerebral metabolism and CB 1 R expression. For monkey K., changes were seen in the stimulated amygdala (hypometabolism), the contralateral amygdala (increased CB 1 R expression), the ipsilateral hippocampus (increased CB 1 R expression), the bilateral putamen (hypometabolism), the ipsilateral insula (hypometabolism), the frontal lobe (hypometabolism contralaterally, and decreased CB 1 R expression bilaterally) and the contralateral occipital cortex (hypermetabolism and increased CB 1 R expression). <b>Monkey</b> <b>S.</b> expressed interictal changes during stage IV in the ipsilateral insula (hypometabolism), the occipital cortex (hypometabolism contralaterally, decreased CB 1 R expression bilaterally), the contralateral hippocampus (hypermetabolism, increased CB 1 R expression), contralateral putamen (increased CB 1 R expression) and the auditory part of the temporal cortex (increased CB 1 R expression). When the monkeys were fully kindled, we investigated to which degree the observed ictal perfusion changes reflected the connectivity of the seizure focus. Therefore, we applied EM-fMRI to study effective connectivity of the kindled site (chapter 5). We observed in both monkeys widespread fMRI activations and deactivations in bilateral cortical and subcortical structures. On the regional level, many changes in fMRI signal were overlapping with the ictal perfusion changes of stage IV. On the voxel level, we observed that in general only a part of an anatomically defined region presented changes in both connectivity and perfusion. Additionally, EM-fMRI revealed widespread areas that were multisynaptically connected to the seizure focus in stage IV kindled monkeys. In the last research chapter, we applied deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the ipsilateral mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus and the contralateral dentate nucleus of the cerebellum in order to interfere with seizure activity, and ultimately to abolish seizure activity as a potential therapy for temporal lobe seizures. We used a range of different DBS parameters, applied at different timings with respect to the kindling pulse. We observed some modulation of the ADD, but seizure activity was never completely interrupted. Also, clinical expression of the seizures remained similar to baseline stage IV conditions. status: publishe...|$|R
