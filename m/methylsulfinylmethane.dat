40|$|<b>Methylsulfinylmethane</b> (dimethyl sulfoxide; DMSO) {{is widely}} used in {{clinical}} treatment and bioresearch. Moreover, there is bioconversion between methylsulfanylmethane (dimethyl sulfide; DMS), DMSO, and methylsulfonylmethane (DMSO 2) in mammalian metabolism. Due to the real-time detection limits for volatile compounds, most {{research has focused on}} DMSO 2 as a stable byproduct of DMSO. Therefore, details about the production of DMS as a byproduct of DMSO metabolism remain to be elucidated. Here, we report the characterization of trace-level volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced following DMSO treatment of cultured human cells using an ultrasensitive vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometer (VUV-PIMS). Using this approach, 24 h after DMSO treatment we detected 16. 9 and 21 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) DMS in the atmosphere above the cells (headspace) within HeLa and 293 T tissue culture flasks, respectively. When simultaneously exposed to 50 nM paclitaxel (PTX), 17. 6 and 22. 3 ppbv DMS were detected in the headspace of HeLa and 293 T culture flasks, respectively. Nevertheless, at doses of PTX more or less than 50 nM, the detectable levels of DMS were reduced to as low as 8. 4 ppbv. Our experimental results demonstrate that by co-administering 5 to 10 nM PTX with DMSO, it is possible to moderate the production of DMS considerably. However, at higher doses of PTX, increased apoptosis was observed that likely contributed to higher DMS production by cells...|$|E
40|$|Chemical group 20 {{consists}} of aliphatic and aromatic mono- and di-thiols and mono-, di-, tri-, and polysulphides {{with or without}} additional oxygenated functional groups, of which 31 are currently authorised for use as flavours in food. The FEEDAP Panel was unable to perform an assessment of six compounds (methanethiol, methyl propyl disulphide, dipropyl trisulphide, 3 -mercaptobutan- 2 -one, 3 -(methylthio) butanal and 3 -methyl- 1, 2, 4 -trithiane) because of {{issues related to the}} purity of the compounds. The FEEDAP Panel concludes that the following 25 compounds are safe for the target species at the proposed maximum dose level (0. 05 mg/kg complete feed) : 3 -(methylthio) propionaldehyde, methyl 3 -(methylthio) propionate, allylthiol, dimethyl sulphide, dibutyl sulphide, diallyl disulphide, diallyl trisulphide, dimethyl trisulphide, dipropyl disulphide, allyl isothiocyanate, dimethyl disulphide, 2 -methylbenzene- 1 -thiol, S-methyl butanethioate, allyl methyl disulphide, 3 -(methylthio) propan- 1 -ol, 3 -(methylthio) hexan- 1 -ol, 1 -propane- 1 -thiol, diallyl sulphide, 2, 4 -dithiapentane, 2 -methyl- 2 -(methyldithio) propanal, 2 -methylpropane- 1 -thiol, <b>methylsulfinylmethane,</b> propane- 2 -thiol, 3, 5 -dimethyl- 1, 2, 4 -trithiolane and 2 -methyl- 4 -propyl- 1, 3 -oxathiane. No safety concern for the consumer would arise from the use of these 25 compounds of CG 20 up to the highest safe level in feedingstuffs for all animal species, with the exception of allyl isothiocyanate. Although additional exposure to this substance through its low use level in animal feeds would not substantially increase consumer exposure, the FEEDAP Panel notes that the estimated exposure of consumers is already higher than the acceptable daily intake (ADI). All compounds should be considered irritant to skin, eyes and respiratory tract and as skin sensitisers. The proposed concentration of 0. 05 mg flavour/kg feed is not expected to cause detrimental effects to the environment, except for 2 -methylpropane- 1 -thiol, for which 0. 04 mg/kg is expected to be safe. Since all 25 compounds are used in food as flavourings and their function is essentially the same as that in food, no further demonstration of efficacy is necessary...|$|E
