50|$|Telelift GmbH is a {{worldwide}} operating German engineering company which develops and installs advanced logistics systems (<b>Monorail</b> <b>conveyor)</b> for hospitals, libraries, industry and security-related applications. The systems provide a comprehensive transport automation of light materials handling {{and have no}} limits in number of operator stations for both sending and receiving of goods in closed and locked container vehicles.|$|E
40|$|A {{system and}} method for {{refurbishing}} and processing parachutes is disclosed including an overhead <b>monorail</b> <b>conveyor</b> system {{on which the}} parachute is suspended for horizontal conveyance. The parachute is first suspended in a partially opened tented configuration wherein open inspection of the canopy is permitted to remove debris and inspect all areas. Following inspection, the parachute is transported by the <b>monorail</b> <b>conveyor</b> to a washing and drying station with the parachute canopy mounted on the conveyor in a systematic arrangement which permits water and air {{to pass through the}} ribbon-like materials of the canopy. Following drying, the chute is conveyed into an interior space where it is finally inspected and removed from the monorial conveyor for folding. The chute is once again mounted on the conveyor and conveyed to a packing area...|$|E
40|$|The {{conveyors}} {{are used}} to transport various products in successive steps until they reach their destination and to ensure cargo volumes to balance the flow buffer. The conveyors monorail type are used for {{the transfer of the}} products, piece by piece and they can be suspended and can operate at heights and different tasks. In this paper is presented a method for the design of the drive shaft of a <b>monorail</b> <b>conveyor,</b> by using CAD-CAE applications...|$|E
50|$|A {{conveyor}} {{system that is}} designed properly will {{last a long time}} with proper maintenance. Here are six of the biggest problems to watch for in overhead type {{conveyor system}}s including I-beam <b>monorails,</b> enclosed track <b>conveyors</b> and power and free conveyors. Overhead conveyor systems have been used in numerous applications from shop displays, assembly lines to paint finishing plants and more.|$|R
40|$|Modern {{industrial}} production involves complex and time-critical process chains which demand a sophisticated {{supply chain management}} and logistics as well as safe and reliable transport systems. Inside a vast factory individual parts (e. g. engines) cover large distances by using specific transport lines, e. g. electric <b>monorail</b> suspension <b>conveyors.</b> In such an environment, the avoidance of any collision of units with the surrounding area or flexible tools becomes a must. Above all, it is an interruption of production {{that has to be}} prevented as this would result in very high financial losses for every minute break. On the other hand, last minute changes in product design are typical and call for a simulation tool to compute dynamic interference checks and to visualize detected risk zones where problems might occur. The paper gives an overview over common interference detection techniques of moving objects among solids and surfaces and finally introduces the prototype Software KoSimu (Kollisionspr√ºfungs-Simulator) developed at the Chair of Geodesy in course of a diploma thesis. It provides a collision check simulator that enables the designer to simulate the motion of a part prototype along a known trajectory through the facility and detect collision spots...|$|R
