25|$|The {{disconnecting}} {{circuit breaker}} (DCB) {{was introduced in}} 2000 and is a high-voltage circuit breaker modeled after the SF6-breaker. It presents a technical solution where the disconnecting function is integrated in the breaking chamber, {{eliminating the need for}} separate disconnectors. This increases the availability, since open-air disconnecting switch <b>main</b> <b>contacts</b> need maintenance every 2–6 years, while modern circuit breakers have maintenance intervals of 15 years. Implementing a DCB solution also reduces the space requirements within the substation, and increases the reliability, {{due to the lack of}} separate disconnectors.|$|E

50|$|Thyristor-assisted {{tap changers}} use {{thyristors}} {{to take the}} on load current while the <b>main</b> <b>contacts</b> change over from one tap to the next. This prevents arcing on the <b>main</b> <b>contacts</b> {{and can lead to}} a longer service life between maintenance activities. The disadvantage is that these tap changers are more complex and require a low voltage power supply for the thyristor circuitry. They are often more costly but this method is used in some modern transformers.|$|E
