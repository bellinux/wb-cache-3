Flanner was cremated, and her ashes were scattered along with Murray's over Cherry Grove in Fire Island where the two had met in 1940, according to Murray's son in his book Janet, <b>My</b> <b>Mother,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Me.</b>|$|E

Thus began a friendship, {{and in no}} unreal sense, even {{a family}} relationship, between Mr. Harrison, <b>my</b> father <b>and</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> {{in which there was}} no alloy {{whatsoever}} of distrust or displeasure on either side, but which remained faithful and loving, more and more conducive to every sort of happiness among us, to the day of my father's death.|$|R

5000|$|She died aged 90 at the Brendoncare Foundation, Froxfield, Wiltshire. She was {{survived by}} her daughter, who {{continued}} to teach her mother's method from a studio at Hungerford, in Berkshire, and wrote a biography of Berk entitled <b>My</b> Improper <b>Mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>Me</b> (Pomona, 2010, [...] ).|$|R
6000|$|She {{reached her}} hand to him, as if to seal a compact, and he took it. She said: [...] "I don't {{know who you are}} or what you are, Mr. Kelley.

60|$|All {{this while}} the speaker {{remained}} standing with her veil down; her answers {{seemed to be}} the briefest possible; and yet, notwithstanding the homely plainness of her dress, there was something about her that impressed both <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> with an idea of cultivation and refinement above her apparent station,--there was a composure and quiet decision in her manner of speaking which produced the same impression on us both.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{he shall}} not see me, sir," [...] {{retorted}} Diogenes lightly, [...] "for I hate him so, {{because of the}} wrong he did to <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> to <b>me.</b> He shall never even hear of me unless I succeed in carving mine own independent fortune, or contrive to die like a gentleman." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was much}} {{amused by the}} pat way in which <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{questioned}} <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> became more interested as I continued my explanation.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am certain," [...] she said, [...] "that I {{have found}} out the true reason of your unwillingness to speak of this matter before <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> before <b>me.</b> An unlucky {{accident}} has associated you in people's minds with Mr. Luker. You have told me what scandal says of HIM. What does scandal say of you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord Arranmore," [...] he said, [...] "forgive me if what I {{must say}} sounds undutiful. I {{know that you}} have suffered. I can realize {{something}} of what you have been through. But your desertion of <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> was a brutality. What you call your creed of life sounds to me hideous. You and I are far apart, and so far as I am concerned, God grant that we may remain so." ...|$|E
60|$|In the hush {{my mother}} {{whispered to me}} that this body was that of the last Pharaoh of Egypt brought from his tomb, but whether this were so I cannot say for certain. At length they brought the mummy which was crowned with a snake-headed circlet of the royal uræus and still draped with {{withered}} funeral wreaths, and stood it on its feet opposite to Peroa just behind and between <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> in such a fashion that it cut off the light from us.|$|E
6000|$|... "Herbert Loring," [...] she said, [...] "you invited <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> to that exhibition. You gave us {{tickets for}} front seats, {{where we would}} be certain to be hypnotized if your {{experiment}} succeeded, {{and you would have}} made us see that false show, which faded from those people's minds as soon as they recovered from the spell, for as they went away they were talking only of the fireworks, and not one of them mentioned a magic egg, or a chicken, or anything of the kind. Answer me this: did you not intend that I should come and be put under that spell?" ...|$|E
50|$|She {{had saved}} <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> brother <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> so now she {{asked my father}} to save her son in return. But my father refused.

In {{the field of}} musicals, he designed, among others, sets and lighting for Show Boat (1946), The Music Man (1957) and Finian's Rainbow (1955 sets, 1960). He {{designed the}} original sets, lighting and costumes for Man of La Mancha in 1965 and all revivals. For dramas, for example, he designed the sets and lighting for The Little Foxes (1967), <b>My</b> <b>Mother,</b> <b>My</b> Father <b>and</b> <b>Me</b> (1963), <b>and</b> Toys in the Attic (1960).|$|R

6000|$|... "You know, sir," [...] he said, [...] "you {{had your}} own way with <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> and I say nothing for or against it. Hannah has other ideas. No one can say {{that she is not}} a good woman, or that she fails in her duty to me. All people do not see life from the same point of view. She is just as conscientious, in her way, as you are in yours. She reads her Bible and draws her own {{conclusions}} from it, just as you do; and as she is the mother of the child, and as I know she will do her best for it, I shall not interfere with her way of doing it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not at all!' said he. 'You {{are giving}} {{this country of}} yours just {{sufficient}} interest to me to make me care to keep alive in it. If my dear land were here also, and my old parent, with you, I could be happy as I am, and would do my best as a soldier. But it is not so. And now listen. This is my plan. That you go with me to my own country, and be my wife there, and live there with <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>me.</b> I am not a Hanoverian, as you know, though I entered the army as such; my country is by the Saar, and is at peace with France, and if I were once in it I should be free.' ...|$|E
60|$|But his {{appearance}} {{was no more}} unusual than the manner of his coming, there to <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> as we perched above the angry wild pigs. He came through the trees, leaping from limb to limb and from tree to tree; and he came swiftly. I can see him now, in my wake-a-day life, as I write this, swinging along through the trees, a four-handed, hairy creature, howling with rage, pausing now and again to beat his chest with his clenched fist, leaping ten-and-fifteen-foot gaps, catching a branch {{with one hand and}} swinging on across another gap to catch with his other hand and go on, never hesitating, never at a loss as to how to proceed on his arboreal way.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who am I {{to bring}} misfortune or to {{withhold}} it?" [...] asked the Hare, softening visibly. [...] "Well, I know what love means, for <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> loved <b>me</b> <b>and</b> I loved {{her in my}} way. I tell you that when I saw her dead, turned from a beautiful living thing into a stained lump of flesh and fur, I felt dreadful. I understand now that you love Tom as <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> loved <b>me,</b> <b>and,</b> Man, {{for the sake of}} your love--not for his sake, mind--I promise you that I won't say anything against Tom if I can help it, or do anything either." ...|$|R

"'Consequence, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> we {{ran away}} from my father several times; and then my mother she'd go out to work, and she'd say, [...] "Joe," [...] she'd say, [...] "now, please God, you shall have some schooling, child," [...] and she'd put me to school. But my father were that good in his hart that he couldn't abear to be without us. So, he'd come with a most tremenjous crowd and make such a row at {{the doors of the}} houses where we was, that they used to be obligated to have no more to do with us and to give us up to him. And then he took us home and {{hammered}} us. Which, you see, Pip," [...] said Joe, pausing in his meditative raking of the fire, and looking at me, [...] "were a drawback on my learning." ...|$|E
6000|$|My aunt Susan {{seemed to}} be taking it in. She was then rather a pretty slender woman of twenty-three or four, I suppose, and I {{remember}} being struck by the blueness of her eyes and the clear freshness of her complexion. She had little features, a button nose, a pretty chin and a long graceful neck that stuck out of her pale blue cotton morning dress. There was a look of half-assumed perplexity on her face, a little quizzical wrinkle of the brow that suggested a faintly amused attempt to follow my uncle's mental operations, a vain attempt and a certain hopelessness that had in succession become habitual. She {{seemed to be}} saying, [...] "Oh Lord! What's he giving me THIS time?" [...] And as came to know her better I detected, as a complication of her effort of apprehension, a subsidiary riddle to [...] "What's he giving me?" [...] and that was--to borrow a phrase from my schoolboy language [...] "Is it keeps?" [...] She looked at <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> and back to her husband again.|$|E
