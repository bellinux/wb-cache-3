5|$|Perfect Dark is set {{in early}} 2022, predating the storyline of the Nintendo 64 game by one year. Joanna Dark is {{a student at the}} Carrington Institute and she is eager to {{complete}} the final stages of her training. After completing her training successfully, Carrington Institute leader Daniel Carrington sends her on a mission to destroy an illegal cyborg manufacturing facility in the South American jungle. The facility is headed by Mink Hunter, a highly dangerous terrorist whose purpose is to produce high-tech weaponry for terrorist operations. Joanna manages to complete her mission by eliminating Hunter and destroying the entire facility. When Carrington contacts Joanna, she reports that, during her landing in the jungle, she witnessed an aircraft being shot down and <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> of the co-ordinates. Carrington soon learns that there is a UFO in the area at the time and that dataDyne, the world's leading developer of new technology, is getting away with the alien wreckage.|$|E

Due to Amherst's influence, Rogers was acquitted of all charges and the verdict was sent to King George III for approval. The king approved, but could not call Gage a liar openly. Instead, he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> that there was reason to think Rogers might have been treasonous.|$|E
25|$|Afterwards Millstatt {{fell into}} meaninglessness and the monastic {{buildings}} decayed. With Upper Carinthia it {{became part of}} the Napoleonic Illyrian Provinces according to the 1809 Treaty of Schönbrunn, but was restored to the Austrian Empire by resolution of the Vienna Congress in 1815. In 1825 the mountaineer Joseph Kyselak (1799–1831) passed the place and <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> of bedraggled houses and bygone splendour. From 1857 the Carinthian monument conservator Baron Gottlieb von Ankershofen (1795–1860) applied himself to preserve the remaining art treasures.|$|E

25|$|On April 12, 2011, Glass <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> on the TAL blog that a {{clarification}} and a correction {{had been made}} to the story on the web. The correction concerned the reason for Kim Spead's 12 months of incarceration after completing the program. After reviewing court documents, Glass concluded that it was for violating the terms and conditions of the Drug Court sentence and contract, and not for failing to pay the $1,500 program costs assessed to drug court participants.|$|E
500|$|Before the 1905 season, Chesbro {{announced}} that he had created a pitch he called the [...] "jump ball". He struggled in the 1905 season, registering a 19-15 record. During the 1905 season, Chesbro was involved in the first squeeze play in baseball. At third base, Chesbro mistakenly thought he had received a steal sign from manager Clark Griffith, while Willie Keeler bunted for a hit. As Chesbro scored, Griffith <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> of the play and taught it in spring training the following season.|$|E
500|$|Fowles {{described}} his main inspiration for The French Lieutenant's Woman to be a persistent {{image of a}} 'Victorian Woman,' who later developed into the novel's titular character Sarah Woodruff. In a 1969 essay titled [...] "Notes on an Unfinished Novel," [...] Fowles reflects on his writing process. He said he had an image during the autumn of 1966 of [...] "A woman [...] stands {{at the end of}} a deserted quay and stares out to sea." [...] He determined that she belonged to a [...] "Victorian Age" [...] and had [...] "mysterious" [...] and [...] "vaguely romantic" [...] qualities.

500|$|Author Rajani Mazumdar {{compared}} Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... to Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994) {{and added}} that the film dealt with themes of family and moral values through a [...] "spectacular stage that moves across global locations". She further stated that the buildup to the story was juxtaposed with the backdrop of two contrasting places– the Raichand home and the interiors of Chandni Chowk. While the Raichand house is described as [...] "expensive, almost like a museum", Chandni Chowk is shown as a world of crowds, chaos and festivities. She also <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> {{of the use of}} frontal camera angles {{in order to ensure that}} the [...] "spectators eye travels throughout the interior expanse".|$|E
500|$|The IPCC {{told reporters}} that the {{post-mortem}} showed no bruising or scratches on Tomlinson's head and shoulders. When the family asked the City of London police, after the post-mortem, whether there had been marks on Tomlinson's body, they were told no; according to The Guardian, Detective Superintendent Anthony Crampton, who was leading the investigation, wrote in his log {{that he did not}} tell the family about a bruise and puncture marks on Tomlinson's leg to avoid causing [...] "unnecessary stress or alarm." [...] On 5 April The Observer published the first photograph of Tomlinson lying on the ground next to riot police. After it was published, Freddy Patel was asked to return to the mortuary, where he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> of bruising on Tomlinson's head that he had not noticed when he first examined him. On 24 April Sky News obtained an image of Tomlinson after he collapsed, which showed bruising {{on the right side of}} his forehead.|$|E
500|$|Between {{the date}} the invitations {{to the conference}} went out (29 November) and {{the date of the}} {{cancelled}} first meeting (9 December), the situation changed. On 5 December, the Soviet Army began a counter-offensive in front of Moscow, ending the prospect of a rapid conquest of the Soviet Union. On 7 December, the Japanese attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor, causing the U.S. to declare war on Japan the next day. The Reich government declared war on the U.S. on 11 December. Some invitees were involved in these preparations, so Heydrich postponed his meeting. Somewhere around this time, Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately, rather than after the war, which now had no end in sight. At the Reich Chancellery meeting of 12 December 1941 he met with top party officials and made his intentions plain. On 18 December, Hitler discussed the fate of the Jews with Himmler in the Wolfsschanze. Following the meeting, Himmler <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> on his service calendar, which simply stated [...] "Jewish question/to be destroyed as partisans".|$|E
50|$|Not much {{is known}} about Lane's early life, but {{he was born and}} educated in London, was a Quaker and in 1817, he began {{studying}} at the famous École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and was a pupil of the French architect, Achille Leclère, who <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>noted</b> restoration of the Pantheon in 1813.|$|R

500|$|Casting {{calls and}} auditions for Alien {{were held in}} both New York and London. With only seven human {{characters}} in the story, Scott sought to hire strong actors so he could focus most of his energy on the film's visual style. He employed casting director Mary Selway, {{who had worked with}} him on The Duellists, to head the casting in the United Kingdom, while Mary Goldberg handled casting in the United States. In developing the story, O'Bannon had focused on writing the Alien first, putting off developing the other characters. He and Shusett had intentionally written all the roles generically: they <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> in the script that explicitly states [...] "The crew is unisex and all parts are interchangeable for men or women." [...] This freed Scott, Selway, and Goldberg to interpret the characters as they pleased, and to cast accordingly. They wanted the Nostromos crew to resemble working astronauts in a realistic environment, a concept summarised as [...] "truckers in space". According to Scott, this concept was inspired partly by Star Wars, which deviated from the pristine future often depicted in science fiction films of the time.|$|E
500|$|While {{reviewing}} {{their show}} on May 3, 2009, at the Van Andel Arena, Troy Reimink {{made a point}} of Crahan's absence, suggesting that while it could have seriously disrupted the tour, it seemed like [...] "merely a bump in the road for Slipknot." [...] Reimink said the band's 17 song setlist, featuring songs from all their albums, [...] "demonstrated the group's skill at assembling relentlessly aggressive songs punctuated with fleeting, occasionally incongruous bits of melody." [...] While noting that Slipknot were [...] "not [...] thing", he described the show as [...] "an exercise in finely calculated chaos", rating the show 2.5 out of 4. Diana Nollen of The Gazette reviewed Slipknot's show in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, describing their stage show as a [...] "sophisticated sideshow of garish masks and growling lyrics." [...] Nollen <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> of their on-stage antics saying that [...] "it's rather entertaining as they lumber across the stage and climb on each other's percussion stations like baboons from hell." [...] Citing the singles [...] "Before I Forget" [...] and [...] "Psychosocial" [...] as particular highlights of the setlist, she concluded her review by saying that the [...] "final visual punch" [...] of drummer Joey Jordison's kit raising, tipping and rotating above the stage was like [...] "a demented version of an Adventureland ride." ...|$|E
500|$|The title OK Computer {{is taken}} from the 1978 Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy radio series, in which the {{character}} Zaphod Beeblebrox speaks the phrase [...] "Okay, computer, I want full manual control now." [...] The members of Radiohead listened to the series on the bus during their 1996 tour and Yorke <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> of the phrase. [...] "OK Computer" [...] was a working title for the song [...] "Palo Alto", which had been considered for inclusion on the album. The title stuck with the band; according to Jonny Greenwood, [...] " [...] started attaching itself and creating all these weird resonances with {{what we were trying}} to do." [...] Yorke said it [...] "refers to embracing the future, it refers to being terrified of the future, of our future, of everyone else's. It's to do with standing in a room where all these appliances are going off and all these machines and computers and so on... and the sound it makes." [...] Yorke described the title as [...] "a really resigned, terrified phrase", to him similar to the Coca-Cola advertisement [...] "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing". Wired writer Leander Kahney suggests that it is an homage to Macintosh computers, as the Mac's speech recognition software responds to the command [...] "OK computer" [...] as an alternative to clicking the [...] "OK" [...] button. Other titles considered were Ones and Zeroes—a reference to the binary numeral system—and Your Home May Be at Risk If You Do Not Keep Up Payments.|$|E

2500|$|According to Pearce:"In 1986 whilst {{staying with}} Tibet in his flat in Freya Aswynn's house in north London {{over a period}} of 3 nights I dreamed I was falling in a sort of rain of indistinct runes. On each {{separate}} night I managed to concentrate enough on one particular rune to stop it from spinning and moving so I could actually see which one it was. When I awoke I <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> of it. After 3 nights the dream stopped and I decided to try and form an 'appropriate' bind rune from the original 3. This I did and after Freya saw it I basically was given a 'thumbs up' about the whole thing. It definitely does not refer to my name but it definitely does refer to ME." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 11, 1936, Hughes {{struck and}} killed a {{pedestrian}} named Gabriel S. Meyer with his car {{at the corner of}} 3rd Street and Lorraine in Los Angeles. After the crash, Hughes was taken to the hospital and certified as sober, but an attending doctor <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> that Hughes had been drinking. A witness to the crash told police that Hughes was driving erratically and too fast, and that Meyer had been standing in the safety zone of a streetcar stop. Hughes was booked on suspicion of negligent homicide and held overnight in jail until his attorney, Neil S. McCarthy, obtained a writ of habeas corpus for his release pending a coroner's inquest. By the time of the coroner's inquiry, however, the witness had changed his story and claimed that Meyer had moved directly in front of Hughes' car. Nancy Bayly (Watts), who was in the car with Hughes {{at the time of the}} crash, corroborated this version of the story. On July 16, 1936, Hughes was held blameless by a coroner's jury at the inquest into Meyer's death. Hughes told reporters outside the inquiry, [...] "I was driving slowly and a man stepped out of the darkness in front of me." ...|$|E
