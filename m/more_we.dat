25|$|Canine compulsions {{are more}} common in some breeds and {{behavioral}} dispositions are often shared within the same litter. This {{suggests that there is}} a genetic factor to the disorder. A questionnaire to dog owners and a blood sample of 181 dogs from four breeds, miniature and standard bull terriers, German shepherds, and Staffordshire bull terriers showed these to be more susceptible to compulsive and repetitive behaviors. It is suggested that the <b>more</b> <b>we</b> learn through studying OCD in dogs, the <b>more</b> <b>we</b> can to understand human biology and the genetics involved in the heredity of susceptibility to disorders such as OCD.|$|E
25|$|Habituation {{is shared}} across species {{and is the}} {{simplest}} form of learning. Here a person’s response to a stimulus weakens when it becomes familiar. For example, with drink driving advertising in New Zealand, a decade ago we saw cars smashing into each other as a scare tactic. The content of these adverts has become less and less shocking the <b>more</b> <b>we</b> {{have been exposed to}} them. We have now become so desensitised to them that a humour approach has to be taken and the latest example is the ‘Legend’ advert.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{biology is}} an {{emerging}} science that regards natural cognition as a biological function. It {{is based on}} the theoretical assumption that every organism—whether a single cell or multicellular—is continually engaged in systematic acts of cognition coupled with intentional behaviors, i.e., a sensory-motor coupling. That is to say, if an organism can sense stimuli in its environment and respond accordingly, it is cognitive. Any explanation of how natural cognition may manifest in an organism is constrained by the biological conditions in which its genes survives {{from one generation to the}} next. And since by Darwinian theory the species of every organism is evolving from a common root, three further elements of cognitive biology are required: (i) the study of cognition in one species of organism is useful, through contrast and comparison, to the study of another species’ cognitive abilities; (ii) it is useful to proceed from organisms with simpler to those with more complex cognitive systems, and (iii) the greater the number and variety of species studied in this regard, the <b>more</b> <b>we</b> understand the nature of cognition.|$|E

500|$|The {{developers}} {{originally intended}} to port existing Halo 3 assets to Reach and update them. For Halo 3, Bungie {{had been forced to}} shrink parts of the game to fit the game engine's constraints, but wanted to make Reach look better than its predecessors. [...] "The <b>more</b> <b>we</b> started looking into this, the <b>more</b> <b>we</b> found that realistically we could rebuild each asset from scratch with a huge increase in quality without significantly investing more time," [...] said Bungie 3D artist Scott Shepherd. [...] Texture resolution and polygon counts for models increased; the Reach assault rifle is constructed of more polygons than an entire Marine character from Halo 3. The prequel concept also gave the art team an opportunity to redesign key enemies, weapons, and elements of the series. Artists found inspiration in the original concept art for Halo: Combat Evolved; the shape for the redesigned Covenant Grunts came from a sketch that concept artist Shi Kai Wang created ten years earlier.|$|E

500|$|Along the way, the {{production}} team went through drafts {{where the first}} act included far more detail than what {{ended up in the}} final version, such as a troll with a Brooklyn accent who would have explained the backstory behind Elsa's magical powers, and a regent for whom Lee was hoping to cast comedian Louis C.K.

[...] The writers {{were able to find}} music, as Nickelodeon has a library of royalty-free music. The writers listened to various marching band tunes.

[...] "We had an Anna character but Kristen really came in and pushed it and made it even funnier and even sweeter I think, and more believable as a three-dimensional character," [...] he said. He also admitted that he [...] "fell in love with 's voice and 's spirit". Director Jennifer Lee said that she loved Bell because the actress shared a similarity with her, that girls could be funny. [...] "So she was a fantastic collaborator," [...] Lee added.

Wenger used his post-match news {{interview}} to praise goalscorer Gilberto Silva and asserted that the Brazilian would be a [...] "very strong player" [...] for the team, in the incoming future.

Wenger believed Arsenal's experience put the team in good stead for the upcoming season: [...] "There are two attitudes to being champions.

Major Buang, Wife and 5 child." [...] Midways CO, Captain L.C. Chambers ordered the flight deck crew to clear the landing area; in the process an estimated US$10 million worth of UH-1 Huey helicopters were pushed overboard into the South China Sea. Once the deck was clear Major Buang approached the deck, bounced once and then touched down and taxied to a halt with room to spare. Major Buang became the first VNAF fixed-wing pilot to ever land on a carrier. A second Cessna O-1 was also recovered by the USS Midway that afternoon.|$|E

500|$|Wolfgang's {{original}} intention {{with the}} album {{was to create a}} collection of previously released b-sides along with three reworked demos, with Eddie saying: [...] "It would [...] a record of our more hardcore songs and none of the pop stuff. That was the initial plan, but the deeper we dug, the <b>more</b> <b>we</b> found. At the same time I was writing new songs. Dave got very excited about that. We all did. We ended up recording demos for 35 songs." [...] After deliberating over whether to self-produce the album or choose a producer from a list that included Rick Rubin and Pat Leonard, Roth suggested John Shanks. Shanks liked the first three songs, and agreed to produce the album, working alongside Wolfgang to pick the demos that would be developed into the album's tracks. While all of Van Halen's albums since 1984 had been produced inside 5150, Roth persuaded the band to work at Henson Recording Studios—where he had been recording for over a decade.|$|E
500|$|Both schools {{sold their}} allotments of Music City Bowl tickets rapidly. Virginia Tech, which was {{attending}} its sixth consecutive bowl game, {{sold more than}} 9,000 tickets {{in the first week}} of sales. Alabama's tickets were primarily distributed to season-ticket holders. Of Alabama's 12,000 bowl tickets, 10,000 were reserved for season-ticket holders and only 2,000 were available for open purchase. These were sold on the first day of sales. By December 9, both Alabama and the game itself had sold their entire allotment of tickets. Virginia Tech had just 200 tickets remaining, and they were sold by the 10th. In an interview with a local newspaper, an official at the Virginia Tech ticket office indicated that demand for tickets was so great that [...] "We could have sold at least a couple thousand <b>more.</b> ... <b>We</b> were inundated for 3-4 days, and then, once Alabama was selected to play in the game, we got a lot more calls, and we were sold out."
