Greenhouse gas emissions are rising much faster than IPCC models expected: “The growth rate of fuel emissions was 3.5% per year for 2000-2007, an almost four fold increase from 0.9% per year in 1990-1999. … This <b>makes</b> <b>current</b> trends in emissions higher than the worst case IPCC-SRES scenario.” ...|$|R

40|$|I analyze a {{model in}} which holding cash imposes a {{negative}} externality: it worsens future adverse selection in markets for long-term assets, which impairs their role for liquidity provision. Adverse selection worsens when potential sellers of long-term assets hold more cash because then fewer sales reflect cash needs, and proportionally more sales reflect private information. Moreover, future market illiquidity <b>makes</b> <b>current</b> cash holding more appealing. This feedback effect may result in hoarding behavior and a market breakdown, which I interpret as a self-fulfilling liquidity dry-up. This mechanism suggests that imposing liquidity requirements on financial institutions may backfire...|$|R
