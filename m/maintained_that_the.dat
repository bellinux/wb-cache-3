5|$|Einstein {{argued that}} {{this is true for}} {{fundamental}} reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{finished}} on December 12, 2006 in Molokai, and {{the first}} assembly cut was three hours. Twenty minutes were removed, not including end credits, though producer Jerry Bruckheimer <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> long running time was {{needed to make the}} final battle work in terms of build-up.|$|E
5|$|In Giessen, Forester Ritter {{was arrested}} {{because he said}} the war would last another three years. Two years ago R. was assassinated because he <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> war would last two years.|$|E

50|$|Those {{scholars}} who maintain the Illyrian origin of Albanians <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> indigenous Illyrian tribes dwelling in South Illyria went {{up into the}} mountains when Slavs occupied the lowlands, while another version of this hypothesis <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Albanians are the descendants of Illyrian tribes located between Dalmatia and the Danube, who spilled south.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Elsie and Frances {{admitted}} that the photographs were faked, using cardboard cutouts of fairies copied from a popular children's book of the time, but Frances <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fifth and final photograph was genuine. The photographs {{and two of the}} cameras used are on display in the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford, England.|$|E
5|$|One {{conservation}} specialist welcomed {{this proposal}} {{as it would}} make captive breeding programmes and future rewilding of zoo-born tigers easier. One geneticist was sceptical of this study and <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> currently recognised nine subspecies can be distinguished genetically.|$|E
5|$|Some {{witnesses}} <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> killer's {{claim to}} be John A. Covington was telling. They said that both Sharp and Beauchamp had been acquainted with John W. Covington, and that Beauchamp often mistakenly called him John A. Covington. Other witnesses told of threats they had heard Beauchamp make against Sharp.|$|E

5|$|Afterward, Evans {{moved the}} Klan's {{national}} headquarters to Washington, D.C., where {{the murder of}} Simmon's lawyer had received less publicity. To Evans' consternation, Stephenson also formed a women's auxiliary group. Evans and Stephenson subsequently exchanged allegations of sexual impropriety. Police charged Stephenson with the kidnapping, {{rape and murder of}} a young woman; he <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> charges were orchestrated by Evans. After a sensational trial, Stephenson was convicted of second degree murder and given a life sentence; the publicity about the leader's behavior caused thousands of members to abandon the Klan.|$|E
5|$|Although Z. Marcas {{features}} {{characters from}} other Balzac stories and elements of literary realism– both hallmarks of Balzac's style– it is remembered primarily for its political themes. Balzac, a legitimist, believed that France's lack of bold leadership {{had led to}} mediocrity and ruin, and that men of quality were being ignored or worse. He <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> youth of France {{were in danger of}} being abandoned by the government, and predicted unrest in the years to come.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{left the}} Centralia area on September 27, pursued {{for the first}} time by Union forces {{equipped}} with artillery. Anderson evaded the pursuit, leading his men into ravines that the Union troops would not enter for fear of ambush. In the aftermath of the attacks, Union soldiers committed several revenge killings of Confederate-sympathizing civilians. They burned Rocheport to the ground on October 2; the town was under close scrutiny by Union forces, owing to the number of Confederate sympathizers there, but General Fisk <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fire was accidental. Anderson watched the fire from nearby bluffs.|$|E

5|$|Another {{conflicting}} issue between Darejan and her reigning step-son was Georgia's {{relations with}} the Russian Empire. Darejan had been skeptical of Georgia's rapprochement with its northern neighbour already in Heraclius's lifetime, especially after the Russians, bound by the 1783 treaty of Georgievsk to protect Heraclius's kingdom from external threat, had left the Georgians {{to their own devices}} {{in the face of a}} disastrous invasion from Iran in 1795. The queen had repeatedly <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> relationship with Russia had brought no benefit to Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Forty {{minutes after}} landing, Sigma 7 was hoisted aboard Kearsarge; five minutes later, Schirra blew the {{explosive}} hatch and climbed {{out to a}} waiting crowd. After doing this, examinations showed clear bruising on his hand from operating the heavy ejector switch, which he felt provided an important vindication for fellow pilot Gus Grissom's hatch expulsion accident during the Liberty Bell 7 mission. Grissom had <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hatch blew without his input; {{the fact that he}} had no bruising was seen as evidence that he had not blown the hatch early and sunk his capsule, but that it was a mechanical malfunction.|$|E
5|$|Free-speech advocates {{condemned}} {{the seizure of}} the painting, while the aldermen <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> painting was an insult to Washington {{and should have been}} taken down. Some students at the SAIC showed their support for free speech by holding rallies in front of the school and at the Richard J. Daley Plaza, while other students criticized Nelson for poor timing in showing a racially insensitive image.|$|E

5|$|In the aftermath, the North Vietnamese proclaimed {{a victory}} at Khe Sanh, while US forces {{claimed that they}} had {{withdrawn}} as the base was no longer required. Historians have observed that the Battle of Khe Sanh may have distracted American and South Vietnamese attention from the buildup of Viet Cong forces in the south before the early 1968 Tet Offensive. Nevertheless, the US commander during the battle, General William Westmoreland, <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> true intention of Tet was to distract forces from Khe Sanh.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} that followed, {{scientists}} and doctors studied the smog's impact. It {{became clear that the}} smog had been a major environmental disaster with severe public health effects. One study estimated that 10 percent of the city's population suffered adverse health effects, such as stinging eyes, coughing, and respiratory distress. City health officials initially <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> smog had not caused any deaths. Later, a statistical analysis found that 168 people had likely died because of the smog. Another study found that the smog had shortened the lifespans of 366 people.|$|E
5|$|Officers in {{the field}} {{were well aware of}} the killing {{operations}} being conducted by the Einsatzgruppen. The Wehrmacht tried to justify their considerable involvement in the Einsatzgruppen massacres as being anti-partisan operations rather than racist attacks, but Hillgruber wrote that this was just an excuse. He states that those German generals who claimed that the Einsatzgruppen were a necessary anti-partisan response were lying, and <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> slaughter of about 2.2 million defenceless civilians for reasons of racist ideology cannot be justified.|$|E

5|$|The tribe {{resolved}} {{to place the}} site on the National Historic Registry. In 1976, the National Park Service designated the site as a National Historic Site. By 1993, the tribe had adopted a master plan to try to preserve the buildings and commissioned a study to determine what the cost would be to restore the property. The U.S. government acknowledged {{that some of the}} thirty-five buildings were in poor shape, but <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rest were properly maintained. In 1998, the site was designated by the World Monuments Fund as one of the 100 most endangered sites.|$|E
5|$|They <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{potassium}} tartrate {{used in his}} treatment prevented his stomach from expelling these compounds and that his thirst was {{a symptom of the}} poison. Their hypothesis was that the calomel given to Napoleon became an overdose, which killed him and left extensive tissue damage behind. According to a 2007 article, the type of arsenic found in Napoleon's hair shafts was mineral, the most toxic, and according to toxicologist Patrick Kintz, this supported the conclusion that he was murdered.|$|E
5|$|As {{a direct}} result of {{watching}} his fellow martial artists train with a fixed-blade fighting knife in class, yet carry some type of a folding knife when they left the training area, Emerson decided there was a need for a sturdy folding knife designed primarily for combat. Although Emerson had always <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> knives he made were built as fighting knives first and foremost, in October 1985 he stripped down five of these designs to simpler materials. He continued his use of linen or canvas micarta because of its high tensile strength and superior gripping surface when wet; he decided on black or dark grey for the color instead of the brighter colors used previously. He retained the titanium for the liners and bolsters but chose to bead-blast them a flat grey matte color as opposed to the colorful anodizing which used to appear on his knives. The reasons for using titanium were its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance.|$|E
