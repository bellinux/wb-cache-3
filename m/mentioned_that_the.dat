Tafforet also stated that the parrots ate the seeds of the bois de buis shrub (Fernelia buxifolia), which is endangered today, but was common all over Rodrigues and nearby islets during his visit. Newton's parakeet may have fed on leaves as the related echo parakeet does. The fact that it survived long after Rodrigues had been heavily deforested shows that its ecology was less vulnerable than that of, for example, the Rodrigues parrot.|$|E

5|$|Super Mario 3D Land {{development}} was heavily {{affected by the}} Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that occurred on March 11, 2011.

Hayashida was inspired by the disaster to encourage his team to communicate more, setting up the office such that staff members could easily see and discuss each other's work. The team also started holding group meetings to play-test 3D Lands levels. Hayashida later <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> team expressed hope that the game would inspire joy in spite of the tragedy.|$|E
5|$|The {{designers}} {{thought that}} Link's appearance should change when Link entered {{a wall and}} the perspective switched from a top-down view to side view.

Aonuma <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> idea of Link turning into a mural was inspired by Phantom Ganon jumping into paintings during his encounter in Ocarina of Time. As the game's story takes place long after the events of a A Link to the Past and the player travels between the two worlds of Hyrule and Lorule, the development team chose A Link Between Worlds instead of A Link to the Past 2 for the game's English-language title.|$|E

5|$|In May 2009, Chris Hemsworth was in {{negotiations}} {{to portray the}} title role after a back-and-forth {{process in which the}} 25-year-old actor was refused early on, then given a second chance to read for the part. Hemsworth's brother, Liam also auditioned for the role, but was passed on by Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige. The next day, Marvel announced that Tom Hiddleston, who had worked with Branagh before and had initially been considered to portray the lead role, had been cast as Loki. In June 2009, Feige confirmed that both Hemsworth and Hiddleston had signed on. Feige <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film would take place on both modern day Earth and Asgard but Thor's human host, Dr. Donald Blake, would not be included. In July 2009, Marvel announced that Natalie Portman would portray Jane Foster. Jaimie Alexander and Colm Feore were reported to have joined the cast in September, with Alexander portraying Sif and Feore's role unrevealed, though it was thought to be a villain. In an interview with Swedish news site Ystads Allehanda, Stellan Skarsgård stated that he had joined the cast, though he did not specify his role. By late October Anthony Hopkins had been cast as Odin in the film. The following month, Marvel announced that they had cast the Warriors Three; Fandral was to be played by Stuart Townsend, Hogun was to be played by Tadanobu Asano and Volstagg was to be played by Ray Stevenson.

5|$|In October 1999 {{during an}} online {{question}} and answer session, John Carmack, while discussing that the original founders of id Software were unlikely to ever work together on a game again, mentioned that he was considering {{the idea of making}} a Commander Keen game for the Game Boy Color handheld game console. IGN, when reporting the statement, <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> idea was not unfeasible, especially given that another 1991 side-scroller, Apogee's Duke Nukem, had just been ported to the same platform. No further mention was made of such a game until April 2001, when id CEO Todd Hollenshead said that such a game had been created, and had been submitted to Nintendo for approval. Activision formally announced at the start of May that a new Commander Keen game had been developed by David A. Palmer Productions, and would be released {{at the end of the}} month. An interview the following week with founder David A. Palmer explained that the original idea for the game came from id, who approached Activision to produce it; Activision in turn recommended Palmer as the developer for the project. Palmer greatly admired id's games, and had been attempting to get an agreement with id and Activision for several years for his studio to make a Game Boy Color version of several of their games, such as the 1993 Doom or 1996 Quake. While Palmer was the developer for the game—with Palmer himself serving as the producer, Jim Meston as lead artist, and Mark Cooksey as composer—id collaborated with the studio, with id having approval over game design elements and artist Adrian Carmack making some tile artwork for the game.|$|E
