25|$|The <b>Monospar</b> ST-25 was a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane with a fabric-covered metal structure. The <b>monospar</b> {{name came}} {{from the use of}} a single spar in the wing structure, that had been developed by H J Stieger. The cabin was enclosed with five seats. It was based on the GAL <b>Monospar</b> ST-10, {{with the addition of a}} folding seat for a fifth passenger, extra side windows, and the addition of a radio receiver. On 19 June 1935, the prototype (G-ADIV) made its first flight at Hanworth Air Park. It was designated <b>Monospar</b> ST-25 Jubilee, to honour the 25th anniversary of the reign of King George V.|$|E

25|$|The last flying <b>Monospar</b> ST-25 (ZK-AFF), of Piet Van Asch, {{the owner}} of New Zealand Aerial Mapping Ltd, was lost in 1986 in a hangar fire.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the mixed}} {{success of the}} earlier <b>Monospar</b> family of aircraft, the company {{designed}} a ten-seat light transport, the ST-18 (later named Croydon). Due to the longer-span wing, {{it was not a}} cantilever <b>monospar</b> wing but had to be fitted with bracing struts. The ST-18 was a low-wing monoplane, with a conventional tail unit and tailwheel landing gear, and hydraulically retractable main gear. It was powered by two Pratt & Whitney Wasp Junior radial engines mounted on the wing leading edges. It had a crew of three, and a cabin for ten passengers, a toilet and baggage compartment.|$|E
25|$|Adelaide Airways {{was formed}} as a {{subsidiary}} of the Adelaide Steamship Company on 3 July 1935 and commenced operations on 29 October. It had a number of different types of aircraft in its fleet, including the Short Scion, the General Aircraft <b>Monospar</b> ST-25, and the De Havilland DH.89A.|$|E
25|$|One {{experimental}} aircraft {{based on}} the <b>Monospar</b> ST-25 Universal. A new fuselage was built containing a pressurized section with two seats. Its purpose was to test possible pressurization systems for a proposed airliner, the GAL.40. The GAL.41 flew {{for the first time}} 11 May 1939, and was grounded in 1941.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s Francis Welham and Arthur Levell {{conceived}} a new single spar duralumin wing structure that promised weight savings without loss of strength. It {{was quite different}} from the already established <b>Monospar</b> design. [...] The wing was built around a cross braced, girder-like box, with the front and rear members attached to it with cantilever ribs. [...] With financial support from S.W. Cole of EKCO radio, they set up a company known by their initials as CLW Aviation, based at Gravesend, Kent and built a wing for testing. [...] This performed to the calculations even under destructive testing, and the company decided to produce a small aeroplane using it. The CLW Curlew was intended both as a demonstrator and as a trainer for those pilots going on to modern, fast monoplanes. It was also seen as a contender in the open two-seater market, particularly for the richer buyer after a machine with [...] "snappier" [...] performance. [...] It made its first flight on 3 September 1936 at Gravesend, flown by the ex-Beardmore pilot A.N. Kingwill.|$|E
50|$|Based on this design, The <b>Monospar</b> Company {{designed}} a twin-engined low-wing aircraft designated the <b>Monospar</b> ST-3, {{that was built}} and flown in 1931 by the Gloster Aircraft Company at Brockworth, Gloucestershire. After successful testing of the <b>Monospar</b> ST-3, a new company General Aircraft Ltd was formed to produce aircraft that used the new <b>Monospar</b> wing designs.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{production}} design was the <b>Monospar</b> ST-4, a twin-engined low-wing monoplane with a fixed tailwheel landing gear and folding wings for ground storage. Powered by two Pobjoy R radial engines, the first aircraft (G-ABUZ) first flew in May 1932, and {{was followed by}} five production aircraft. The <b>Monospar</b> ST-4 Mk.II, an improved variant with minor differences, followed with a production run of 30. In 1933, the <b>Monospar</b> ST-6 appeared, a similar aircraft to the ST-4 with manually retractable landing gear and room for an extra passenger. The <b>Monospar</b> ST-6 was only the second British aircraft to fly with retractable landing gear (the first, the Airspeed Courier, was flown a few weeks earlier). Another <b>Monospar</b> ST-6 was built, and two ST-4 Mk.IIs were converted. GAL then produced a developed version, the [...] <b>Monospar</b> ST-10, externally the same but powered by two Pobjoy Niagara engines, an improved fuel system, and aerodynamic refinements.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Monospar</b> ST-25 was a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane with a fabric-covered metal structure. The <b>monospar</b> {{name came}} {{from the use of}} a single spar in the wing structure, that had been developed by H J Stieger. The cabin was enclosed with five seats.

50|$|The <b>Monospar</b> was {{retired in}} 1943 and Aerial Mapping took {{delivery}} of a Beechcraft AT-11 Kansan, which had been imported by the RNZAF.In 1967 the old <b>Monospar</b> was restored and put back into flying condition, {{it was the last}} remaining plane of its sort.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Monospar</b> ST-10 {{prototype}} (G-ACTS) won the 1934 King's Cup Air Race with {{an average}} speed of 134.16 mph. Only one other ST-10 was built, along with two similar ST-11s with de Havilland Gipsy Major engines for export to Australia. A production batch of ten <b>Monospar</b> ST-12 aircraft {{was based on the}} ST-11 with fixed landing gear.|$|E
50|$|On 27 February 1931, General Aircraft Limited (GAL) {{was formed}} to {{undertake}} production of aircraft using the 'monospar' wing designs of the Mono-spar Company Ltd. Both firms were headed by Helmut J. Stieger, the Swiss inventor of the technique. GAL produced about 28 examples of the <b>Monospar</b> series of twin-engined light transport aircraft at Croydon Aerodrome between 1932 pand 1934. In October 1934, both companies were re-capitalised by investment group British Pacific Trust, and were re-formed in a new company also named General Aircraft Limited. Also included in the new company were the assets of National Flying Services Ltd, the owner of London Air Park, plus adjoining industrial premises built in 1917 by Whitehead Aircraft Ltd. In early 1935, the Crystal Croydon production facilities were transferred to the Hanworth site, near Feltham. Production then restarted with the <b>Monospar</b> ST-12, <b>Monospar</b> ST-18, and <b>Monospar</b> ST-25.|$|E

5000|$|The A.33 was a four-engined flying-boat with a parasol <b>monospar</b> wing, {{the wing}} was {{supported}} by two angled N-struts which connected the wing to hull-mounted sponsons. The hull-mounted sponsons were used rather than wingtip floats and were also used as fuel tanks. A Saro Cloud was modified with a <b>monospar</b> wing and sponsons to test the design concepts. The A.33 serial number K4773 first flew on 14 October 1938. However, the A33 prototype was written off after structural failure sustained during high-speed taxi trials on 25 October 1938 and development was abandoned. [...] A production contract for eleven aircraft was cancelled.|$|E
