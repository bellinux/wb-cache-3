50|$|MasPar Computer Corporation was a <b>minisupercomputer</b> vendor {{that was}} founded in 1987 by Jeff Kalb. The company was based in Sunnyvale, California.|$|E
50|$|Supertek Computers Inc. was a {{computer}} company founded in Santa Clara, California in 1985 by Mike Fung, an ex-Hewlett-Packard project manager, {{with the aim}} of designing and selling low-cost <b>minisupercomputers</b> compatible with those from Cray Research.|$|R
50|$|Multiflow {{delivered}} {{its first}} working VLIW <b>minisupercomputers</b> in early 1987 to three beta-sites: Grumman Aircraft, Sikorsky Helicopter, and the Supercomputer Research Center. A Trace 14/200 was demonstrated {{to the public}} at a supercomputing conference in May, 1987, in Santa Clara, California.|$|R
50|$|Convex Computer Corporation was {{a company}} that developed, {{manufactured}} and marketed vector <b>minisupercomputers</b> and supercomputers for small-to-medium-sized businesses. Their later Exemplar series of parallel computing machines {{were based on the}} Hewlett-Packard (HP) PA-RISC microprocessors, and in 1995, HP bought the company. Exemplar machines were offered for sale by HP for some time, and Exemplar technology was used in HP's V-Class machines.|$|R
50|$|Celerity {{attempted}} {{to make the transition}} to being a <b>minisupercomputer</b> vendor with the development of the Celerity 6000, based on the ACCEL architecture implemented in ECL based on parts from Bipolar Integrated Technology. The Celerity 6000 had a 33 MHz system clock and up to 8 processors (max 8 scalar processors or 4 scalar processors and 4 vector processors). After running into financial difficulties during the development of the Celerity 6000, the assets and technologies of Celerity Computing were acquired by Floating Point Systems in 1988. The Celerity 6000 was completed and released as the FPS Model 500 <b>minisupercomputer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Convex lasted {{longer than}} most <b>minisupercomputer</b> companies, and to {{celebrate}} this and more so to remind themselves of the difficulties of the market, Convex had a graveyard of former competitor companies on its property.|$|E
50|$|After Digital {{decided not}} to commercialize the {{research}} project, Kalb decided to start a company to sell this <b>minisupercomputer.</b> In 1990, the first generation product MP-1 was delivered. In 1992, the follow-on MP-2 was shipped. The company shipped more than 200 systems.|$|E
5000|$|Floating Point Systems Inc. (FPS) was a Beaverton, Oregon vendor of {{attached}} {{array processors}} and <b>minisupercomputers.</b> The company {{was founded in}} 1970 by former Tektronix engineer Norm Winningstad, with partners Tom Prince, Frank Bouton and Robert Carter. Carter was a salesman for Data General Corp. who persuaded Bouton and Prince to leave Tektronix to start the new company. Winningstad was the fourth partner.|$|R
50|$|<b>Minisupercomputers</b> {{constituted}} a short-lived class of computers {{that emerged in}} the mid-1980s, characterized by the combination of vector processing and small-scale multiprocessing. As scientific computing using vector processors became more popular, the need for lower-cost systems that might be used at the departmental level instead of the corporate level created an opportunity for new computer vendors to enter the market. As a generalization, the price targets for these smaller computers were one-tenth of the larger supercomputers.|$|R
50|$|Other {{examples}} followed. Control Data Corporation {{tried to}} re-enter the high-end market again with its ETA-10 machine, but it sold poorly {{and they took}} that {{as an opportunity to}} leave the supercomputing field entirely. In the early and mid-1980s Japanese companies (Fujitsu, Hitachi and Nippon Electric Corporation (NEC) introduced register-based vector machines similar to the Cray-1, typically being slightly faster and much smaller. Oregon-based Floating Point Systems (FPS) built add-on array processors for minicomputers, later building their own <b>minisupercomputers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Cydra-5 {{departmental}} supercomputer is {{the first}} <b>minisupercomputer</b> designed by Cydrome. It was completed in 1987. At that time Cydra-5 cost from $0.5 million to $1 million, but achieved one-third to one-Half performance of supercomputers which cost around $10 million to $20 million.|$|E
5000|$|The Cray EL90 {{series was}} an {{air-cooled}} vector processor supercomputer first sold by Cray Research in 1993. The EL90 series {{evolved from the}} Cray Y-MP EL <b>minisupercomputer,</b> and is compatible with Y-MP software, running the same UNICOS operating system. The range comprised three models: ...|$|E
50|$|Along with Cydrome, an attached-VLIW <b>minisupercomputer</b> {{company that}} had less {{commercial}} success, Multiflow demonstrated that the VLIW design style was practical, a conclusion surprising to many. While still controversial, VLIW has since been a force in high-performance embedded systems, and has been finding slow acceptance in general-purpose computing.|$|E
50|$|Several notable technical, economic, and {{political}} attributes characterize <b>minisupercomputers.</b> First, they were architecturally more diverse than prior mainframes and minicomputers in hardware and less diverse in software. Second, advances in VLSI made them less expensive (mini-price). These machines were market targeted to be cost-effective and quickly manufactured. Third, it is notable {{who did not}} manufacture minisupercomputers: within the USA, IBM and the traditional mainframe makers, outside the USA: the Japanese supercomputer vendors and Russia (despite attempts to manufacture minicomputers).|$|R
50|$|Fisher left Yale in 1984 {{to found}} a startup company, Multiflow, along with cofounders John O'Donnell and John Ruttenberg. Multiflow {{produced}} the TRACE series of VLIW <b>minisupercomputers,</b> shipping their first machines in 1987. Multiflow's VLIW could issue 28 operations in parallel per instruction. The TRACE system was implemented in a mix of medium-scale integration (MSI), large-scale integration (LSI), and very large-scale integration (VLSI), packaged in cabinets, a technology obsoleted as it grew more cost-effective to integrate all {{of the components of}} a processor (excluding memory) on one chip.|$|R
50|$|Alliant was founded, as Dataflow Systems, in May 1982 by Ron Gruner, Craig Mundie and Rich McAndrew {{to produce}} {{machines}} for scientific and engineering users who needed smaller, less costly machines than offerings from Cray Computer and similar high-end vendors. Machines that addressed this market segment later {{became known as}} <b>minisupercomputers.</b> At the {{time there was a}} huge gap on the price/performance curve as a highly configured VAX 11/780 had a performance of about a MIP and MegaFLOP for around $1M USD and a Cray-1S or Cray 1M over $10M USD.|$|R
50|$|Multiflow Computer, Inc., {{founded in}} April, 1984 near New Haven, Connecticut, USA, was a {{manufacturer}} and seller of <b>minisupercomputer</b> {{hardware and software}} embodying the VLIW design style. Multiflow, incorporated in Delaware, ended operations in March, 1990, after selling about 125 VLIW minisupercomputers in the United States, Europe, and Japan.|$|E
50|$|In 1988, FPS {{acquired}} {{the assets of}} Celerity Computing of San Diego, California, renaming itself as FPS Computing. Celerity's product lines were further developed by FPS, the Celerity 6000 <b>minisupercomputer</b> being developed into the FPS Model 500 series. They later became the S-MP and APP product lines of Cray Research when FPS was acquired by Cray in 1991 for $3.25 million.|$|E
50|$|Also in July 1988 Alliant {{purchased}} Raster Technologies, {{a provider}} of high-resolution graphics terminals and custom graphics cards for Sun Microsystems workstations. Their GX4000 product {{was a combination of}} PHIGS+ software and special graphical boards that could generate and display graphical vectors very fast. For 3D effects, a hardware Z-buffer was available. The Raster graphics technology was integrated with FX/40 and FX/80 machines to produce the VFX, Alliant's first fully integrated graphical <b>minisupercomputer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The United States Department of Energy funded {{sites from}} Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratory and the National Science Foundation {{supercomputer}} centers (for high-energy physics) represented {{the second largest}} block with LLL's Cray Time Sharing System (CTSS). CTSS was written in a dynamic memory Fortran, first named LRLTRAN, which ran on CDC 7600s, renamed CVC (pronounced [...] "Civic") when vectorization for the Cray-1 was added. Cray Research attempted to support these sites accordingly. These software choices had influences on later <b>minisupercomputers,</b> also known as [...] "crayettes".|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{requirements}} of the NASA Langley Research Center for simulating the increased complexity and higher performance of modern aircraft, a flight simulation computing system with very high scalar performance is needed. The requirements and proposed response, probable areas of difficulty, planned implementation, and current status and plans are reviewed. A solution utilizing centralized <b>minisupercomputers</b> coupled with a proven real-time network technology will provide engineers and research scientists with the tools required for high-performance flight simulation. Subsequent to testing and verification of the initial simulation, general-purpose configuration management software with a nonconfiguration dependent serial highway driver software will be integrated to support any arbitrary combination of simulation sites...|$|R
40|$|In 1988 a {{new class}} of computer, the {{graphics}} supercom-puter, was introduced by two start-up companies. As a member of both the supercomputer and workstation fami-lies, the graphics supercomputer enables both high-per-formance computation and high-speed, threedimensional, interactive visualization to be performed on a single, inte-grated system. In Ardent's TITAN system, high floating point operation rates are provided by combining the fastest RISC microprocessors with traditional supercomputer components such as multiple, pipelined vector processors and interleaved memory systems. This has resulted in much more cost-effective computation and a clear diseconomy of scale over supercomputers and <b>minisupercomputers.</b> For users ofworkstations that lack the benefits of supercomputer components, the graphics supercomputer can be used sim...|$|R
50|$|ETA's demise was {{not based}} solely on {{operating}} system choice or existence. The Fortran compiler (ftn200) had not changed significantly from the CDC205. This compiler retained vendor-specific programming performance features (known as the Q8* subroutine calls) {{in an era when}} supercomputer users were realizing the necessity of source code portability between architectures. Additionally, the compiler optimizations were not keeping up with existing technology as shown by the Japanese supercomputer vendors (e.g. NEC) as well as the newer <b>minisupercomputer</b> makers and competition at Cray Research.|$|E
50|$|The Cray XMS was a vector {{processor}} <b>minisupercomputer</b> sold by Cray Research from 1990 to 1991. The XMS was originally designed by Supertek Computers Inc. as the Supertek S-1, {{intended to be}} a low-cost air-cooled clone of the Cray X-MP with a CMOS re-implementation of the X-MP processor architecture, and a VMEbus-based Input/Output Subsystem (IOS). The XMS could run Cray's UNICOS operating system. Supertek were acquired by Cray Research in 1990, and the S-1 was rebadged XMS by Cray. Its processor had a 55 ns clock period (18.2 MHz clock frequency) and 16 megawords (128 MB) of memory.|$|E
50|$|While {{a few of}} Multiflow's sales went to {{organizations}} wishing {{to learn more about}} the new VLIW design style, most systems were used for simulation in product development environments: mechanical, aerodynamic, defense, crash dynamics, chemical, and some electronic. Customers ranged from a major metropolitan air-quality board to a major consumer detergent, food and sundries company, along with the expected heavy industry companies, research laboratories and universities. In 1987, GEI Rechnersysteme GmbH, a division of Daimler-Benz, began distributing Traces in Germany with great success, despite fierce competition from other <b>minisupercomputer</b> companies. In the following three years, Multiflow opened offices or had distributors in most of Western Europe and Japan, and opened offices in many US metropolitan areas.|$|E
50|$|New vendors {{introduced}} small supercomputers, {{known as}} <b>minisupercomputers</b> (as opposed to superminis) {{during the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, which out-competed low-end Cray machines in the market. The Convex Computer series, {{as well as a}} number of small-scale parallel machines from companies like Pyramid Technology and Alliant Computer Systems were particularly popular. One such vendor was Supertek, whose S-1 machine was an air-cooled CMOS implementation of the X-MP processor. Cray purchased Supertek in 1990 and sold the S-1 as the Cray XMS, but the machine proved problematic; meanwhile, their not-yet-completed S-2, a Y-MP clone, was later offered as the Cray Y-MP EL (later becoming the EL90 series) which started to sell in reasonable numbers in 1991-92—to mostly smaller companies, notably in the oil exploration business. This line evolved into the Cray J90 and eventually the Cray SV1 in 1998.|$|R
2500|$|The {{benefits}} for MG were considerable, {{but by the}} later 1980s, UNIX workstations such as Sun-3 with raster graphics (initially at a resolution of 256 by 256) had started to appear. Computer-assisted drug design in particular required raster graphics for the display of computed properties such as atomic charge and electrostatic potential. Although E had a high-end range of raster graphics (primarily aimed at the aerospace industry) they {{failed to respond to}} the low-end market challenge where single users, rather than engineering departments, bought workstations. As a result, the market for MG displays passed to Silicon Graphics, coupled with the development of <b>minisupercomputers</b> (e.g., CONVEX and Alliant) which were affordable for well-supported MG laboratories. Silicon Graphics provided a graphics language, IrisGL, which was easier to use and more productive than the PS300 architecture. Commercial companies (e.g., Biosym, Polygen/MSI) ported their code to Silicon Graphics, and by the early 1990s, this was the [...] "industry standard". Dial boxes were often used as control devices.|$|R
50|$|The Cray J90 series (code-named Jedi during development) was an {{air-cooled}} {{vector processor}} supercomputer first sold by Cray Research in 1994. The J90 {{evolved from the}} Cray Y-MP EL <b>minisupercomputer,</b> and is compatible with Y-MP software, running the same UNICOS operating system. The J90 supported up to 32 CMOS processors with a 10 ns (100 MHz) clock. It supported up to 4 GB of main memory and up to 48 GB/s of memory bandwidth, giving it considerably less performance than the contemporary Cray T90, but making it a strong competitor to other technical computers in its price range. All input/output in a J90 system was handled by an IOS (Input/Output Subsystem) called IOS Model V. The IOS-V {{was based on the}} VME64 bus and SPARC I/O processors (IOPs) running the VxWorks RTOS. The IOS was programmed to emulate the IOS Model E, used in the larger Cray Y-MP systems, in order to minimize changes in the UNICOS operating system. By using standard VME boards, a wide variety of commodity peripherals could be used.|$|E
50|$|Multiflow ended {{operations}} on March 27, 1990, {{two days after}} a large deal contemplated with Digital Equipment Corporation came apart. At that point, the board determined that the prospects for successful additional financing, in the amounts necessary to bring Multiflow to maturity, were too unlikely to justify the company's continuation. Multiflow's failure is often blamed anecdotally on “good technology, but bad marketing,” on “good software, but slow, conservative hardware,” on some property of its innovative technology, or even on the isolated location of its headquarters. The more likely cause was that its business plan was incompatible with seismic shifts in the computer industry. Building a full-scale, general-purpose computer company seemed to require many {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars (US) by 1990. But the killer micro revolution meant there would be a steady march of ever faster and cheaper competition. The economies inherent in microprocessors were inaccessible to startups in general, and incompatible with VLIWs, which would have required too much silicon for the densities of the time. (The first VLIW microprocessor was the Philips Life, the ancestor of today's TriMedia, delivered several years later.) Since the founding of Sun and SGI in the early 1980s, no new general-purpose computer company has succeeded without building computers for which there was an existing large software base, and none of the many <b>minisupercomputer</b> startup companies of the 1980s eventually succeeded.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the {{efficiency}} and parallelizability of the finite strip method {{for the analysis of}} certain structural problems. This method, first developed in the context of thin plate bending analysis, is a semi-analytical finite element process. It takes advantage of orthogonal properties of harmonic functions in the stiffness matrix formulation to yield a block diagonal stiffness matrix. The method not only simplifies the data manipulation in forming the matrix but also reduces the bandwidth of the assembled matrix, resulting in great savings in the solution process. Furthermore, the block diagonal structure of the matrix offers obvious advantages for solving the problem on parallel computers. Numerical experiments and the performance of this method on an Alliant FX/ 8 <b>minisupercomputer</b> are reported. Some parallel implementations of this method on the University of Illinois Cedar multiprocessor are presented. 1. Introduction. Recent developments in supercomputing techno [...] ...|$|E
