500|$|In an {{interview}} in 2007 when asked about politics he said, [...] "I'd been unemployed all my life. It {{was a big deal}} for me when they (Labour) got in. Now David Cameron is no different from Tony Blair and Gordon Brown is no different from David Cameron. They're all cut from the same cloth and it annoys me that the biggest political icon in the last 30 years has been Margaret Thatcher. Someone who tried to destroy the working class. It freaks me out. So I don't really think there's anything left to vote for. I believe that I, as a person, can only change things once every 5 years and that's by voting, and <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> that even casting that vote means that the same guy gets in, the only difference is one has a red tie and the other has a blue one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rickey {{said that}} [...] "some {{members of the}} Republican Party are not sure what Duke's views are. <b>My</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> there is a {{difference}} between being a conservative and being a racist. He's trying to blur that distinction." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....if a nonhuman animal were {{to kill a}} {{human being}} in the U.S., it would have broken {{the laws of the}} land and would {{probably}} get rougher sanctions than if it were a human. [...] <b>My</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> that like laws govern all who interact within a society, rights are to be applied to all beings who interact within that society. [...] This is not to say these rights endowed by humans are equivalent to those held by nonhuman animals, but rather that if humans possess rights then so must all those who interact with humans.|$|E

Last, but not least, I want to express my greetings to Professor Frempong today  March 6 th 2 007  when the people in the Republic of Ghana are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of their Independence.

2500|$|A minor {{controversy}} erupted when Lowell {{admitted to}} having incorporated (and altered) private letters from his ex-wife, Elizabeth Hardwick into poems for The Dolphin. He was particularly criticized for this by his friends Adrienne Rich and Elizabeth Bishop. Bishop presented Lowell with an argument against publishing The Dolphin. In a letter to Lowell regarding The Dolphin, dated March 21, 1972, before he'd published the book, Bishop praised the writing, saying, [...] "Please believe that I think it is wonderful poetry." [...] But then she stated, [...] "I'm sure <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> only too plain ... Lizzie [...] is not dead, etc.--but there is a 'mixture of fact & fiction' , and you have changed [...] letters. That is 'infinite mischief,' I think ... One can use one's life as material--one does anyway--but these letters--aren't you violating a trust? IF you were given permission--IF you hadn't changed them ... etc. But art just isn't worth that much." [...] Adrienne Rich responded to the controversy quite differently. Instead of sending Lowell a private letter on the matter, she publicly criticized Lowell and his books The Dolphin and To Lizzie and Harriet in a review {{that appeared in the}} American Poetry Review and that effectively ended the two poets' long-standing friendship. Rich called the poems [...] "cruel and shallow." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 14 February 2007 {{news conference}} U.S. President George W. Bush reiterated {{his claim that}} the Quds Force was causing unrest in Iraq, stating: [...] "I can say with {{certainty}} that the Quds force, {{a part of the}} Iranian government, has provided these sophisticated IEDs that have harmed our troops. And I'd like to repeat, I do not know whether or not the Quds Force was ordered from the top echelons of government. But <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> what's worse – them ordering it and it happening, or them not ordering it and it happening? And so we will continue to protect our troops. ... to say it [...] is provoking Iran is just a wrong way to characterize the Commander-in-Chief's decision to do what is necessary to protect our soldiers in harm's way. And I will continue to do so. ... Whether Ahmadinejad ordered the Quds force to do this, I don't think we know. But we do know that they're there, and I intend to do something about it. And I've asked our commanders to do something about it. And we're going to protect our troops. ... I don't think we know who {{picked up the phone and}} said to the Quds Force, go do this, but we know it's a vital part of the Iranian government. …What matters is, is that we're responding. The idea that somehow we're manufacturing the idea that the Iranians are providing IEDs is preposterous. ... My job is to protect our troops. And when we find devices that are in that country that are hurting our troops, we're going to do something about it, pure and simple. ... does this mean you're trying to have a pretext for war? No. It means I'm trying to protect our troops." ...|$|E

5000|$|Ambassador Mull {{issued an}} apology for Comey's remarks. When asked about his remarks, Comey said, [...] "I regret linking Germany and Poland ...

6000|$|In the end Mr. Mac {{agreed to}} {{suppress}} his book, on certain conditions: in my preface I must thank the [...] "Alta" [...] for waiving [...] "rights" [...] and granting me permission. I {{objected to the}} thanks. I could not with any large degree of sincerity thank the [...] "Alta" [...] for bankrupting my lecture-raid. After considerable debate <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> conceded and the thanks left out.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can form}} your own opinion. <b>My</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> {{that it would}} suit him if you didn't come back from this trip. With nobody to dispute his {{statements}} he'd prove he had a claim to all you own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that's hard to answer, too. I don't think I {{actively}} liked or disliked any of them. They {{seemed to}} me just not worth while. <b>My</b> <b>point</b> <b>is,</b> rather, why are we wasting a perfectly good evening mixing with them? What's the use? That's my case in a nut-shell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mere {{naming of}} one's {{position}} does not settle it, Terrence," [...] Dick replied. [...] "I know <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> Carlylean, {{but that does}} not invalidate it. Hero-worship is a very good thing. I am talking, not as a mere scholastic, but as a practical breeder with whom the application of Mendelian methods is an every-day commonplace." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; disease," [...] I {{admitted}} in a cheerful tone {{which seemed to}} shock him. But <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> gained, {{because he had to}} raise his voice to give me his tale. It is not worth while to record his version. It was just over two months since all this had happened, and he had thought so much about it that he seemed completely muddled as to its bearings, but still immensely impressed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I say it--but hasn't <b>my</b> whole <b>point</b> <b>been</b> that I don't ask you to. Therefore," [...] she demanded--but {{smiling at}} him now-- [...] "where's the logic?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{came out}} of the rut and worked. A rash experiment, perhaps, but it didn't prove so {{harrowing}} as I feared; and there's some satisfaction in having no debts. But <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> that you can't do much without proper implements, and I feel that we'll have to get them. The proposal I've the pleasure of seconding, shows you how." ...|$|E
6000|$|I hesitated--there were so {{many ways}} of putting it; but I gave them all up. [...] "Ah, I {{think it will be}} only he who can tell you! <b>My</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> that you've the {{instinct}}--playing in you, on either side, with all the ease of experience--of what you are to each other. All I mean is that it's the instinct that Long and his good friend must have. They too perhaps haven't spoken to each other. But where he comes she does, and where she comes he does. That's why I know she's among us." ...|$|E

"I take {{a sincere}} and earnest {{interest}} in my work," [...] the professor declared, [...] "and I feel {{that when it}} has to be scamped that my daughter may sing a music-hall ditty, the result is, to say the least of it, undignified. For some reason or other, I have been unable to induce the management to see entirely with me, but <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> that Beatrice should sing one song only, and that the additional ten minutes should be occupied by me in either a further exposition of my extraordinary powers as a hypnotist, or in a little address to the audience upon the hidden sciences. Now I appeal to you, Mr. Tavernake, as a young man of common sense. What is your opinion?" ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{was asked}} {{by a member of}} an {{academic}} audience a few years ago whether I thought Hamas and Hezbollah belonged to [...] "the global left" [...] and I replied with two <b>points.</b> <b>My</b> first <b>point</b> <b>was</b> merely descriptive: those political organizations define themselves as anti-imperialist, and anti-imperialism is one characteristic of the global left, so on that basis one could describe them as part of the global left. <b>My</b> second <b>point</b> <b>was</b> then critical: as with any group on the left, one has to decide whether one is for that group or against that group, and one needs to critically evaluate their stand.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, as I was saying, I {{know nothing}} against this Mr Chalmers. Probably his finger-prints {{are in the}} Rogues' Gallery, and he is better known to the police as Jack the Blood, or something, but he hasn't shown that side of him yet. <b>My</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> that, whoever he is, I do not want him or anybody else coming and taking up his abode here while I have to be cook and housemaid too. I object to having a {{stranger}} on the premises spying out the nakedness of the land. I am sensitive about my honest poverty. So, darling Nutty, my precious Nutty, you poor boneheaded muddler, will you kindly think up at your earliest convenience some plan for politely ejecting this Mr Chalmers of yours from our humble home?--because if you don't, I'm {{going to have a}} nervous breakdown.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Here {{it will be}} as well {{to pause}} a moment and avert one {{possible}} misunderstanding. I do not mean that you and I cannot and do not practically see and personally remark on this or that eccentric or intermediate type, for which the word [...] "feeble-minded" [...] might be a very convenient word, and might correspond to a genuine though indefinable fact of experience. In {{the same way we}} might speak, and do speak, of such and such a person being [...] "mad with vanity" [...] without wanting two keepers to walk in and take the person off. But I ask the reader to remember always that I am talking of words, not as they are used in talk or novels, but as they will be used, and have been used, in warrants and certificates, and Acts of Parliament. The distinction between the two is perfectly clear and practical. The difference is that a novelist or a talker can be trusted to try and hit the mark; it is all to his glory that the cap should fit, that the type should be recognised; that he should, in a literary sense, hang the right man. But {{it is by no means}} always to the interests of governments or officials to hang the right man. The fact that they often do stretch words in order to cover cases is the whole foundation of having any fixed laws or free institutions at all. <b>My</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> not that I have never met anyone whom I should call feeble-minded, rather than mad or imbecile. <b>My</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> that if I want to dispossess a nephew, oust a rival, silence a blackmailer, or get rid of an importunate widow, there is nothing in logic to prevent my calling them feeble-minded too. And the vaguer the charge is the less they will be able to disprove it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think so," [...] {{he replied}} blandly. [...] "You see, <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> this. We feel {{that in a}} measure now the Scarlet Pimpernel is in our power. Within {{the next few hours}} he will land at Boulogne... Boulogne, where he has agreed to fight a duel with me... Boulogne, where Lady Blakeney happens to be at this present moment... as you see, Boulogne has a great {{responsibility}} to bear: just now she is to a certain extent the proudest city in France, since she holds within her gates a hostage for the appearance on our shores of her country's most bitter enemy. But she must not fall from that high estate. Her double duty is clear before her: she must guard Lady Blakeney and capture the Scarlet Pimpernel; if she fail in the former she must be punished, if she succeed in the latter she shall be rewarded." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the lyrics}} Lion calls out Lil' Wayne, and Ye, a short from Yeezy, a {{nickname}} of rapper Kanye West. He {{was criticized for}} being a [...] "hater" [...] for doing so but defended his actions and stated that those artists are among his heroes: They <b>are</b> <b>my</b> idols. <b>My</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> {{that if you have}} that power of influence over the mass majority—especially in hip-hop—and you’re not doing what you can, then the messages continue to be hidden. I was just saying a song like this from the hip-hop community is overdue. Adair Lion ...|$|R
5000|$|Butler {{describes}} {{the origin of}} her remarks on Hamas and Hezbollah in the following way: I was asked {{by a member of}} an academic audience a few years ago whether I thought Hamas and Hezbollah belonged to [...] "the global left" [...] and I replied with two <b>points.</b> <b>My</b> first <b>point</b> <b>was</b> merely descriptive: those political organizations define themselves as anti-imperialist, and anti-imperialism is one characteristic of the global left, so on that basis one could describe them as part of the global left. <b>My</b> second <b>point</b> <b>was</b> then critical: as with any group on the left, one has to decide whether one is for that group or against that group, and one needs to critically evaluate their stand.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Not at all,' said Psmith deprecatingly. 'Not at all. You do {{not take}} me. <b>My</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> this. I {{do not wish to}} revive painful memories, but it cannot be denied that there was, here and there, some slight bickering between us on that occasion. The fault,' said Psmith magnanimously, 'was {{possibly}} mine. I may have been too exacting, too capricious. Perhaps so. However, the fact remains that you conceived the happy notion of getting me into this bank, under the impression that, once I was in, you would be able to--if I may use the expression--give me beans. You said as much to me, if I remember. I hate to say it, but don't you think that if you give me the sack, although my work is satisfactory to the head of my department, you will be by way of admitting that you bit off rather more than you could chew? I merely make the suggestion.' ...|$|E
60|$|I do {{not deny}} the intense human {{interest}} of these open questions, the imperative need there {{is to get the}} truth, whether one considers it to be one's own truth or the universal truth, upon them. But <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> that they are to be discussed apart from Socialist theory, and that anyhow they {{have nothing to do with}} Socialist politics. It is no doubt interesting to discuss the benefits of vaccination and the justice and policy of its public compulsion, to debate whether one should eat meat or confine oneself to a vegetable dietary, whether the overhead or the slot system is preferable for tramway traction, whether steamboats are needed on the Thames in winter, and whether it is wiser to use metal or paper for money; but none of these things have anything to do with the principles of Socialism. Nor need we decide whether Whistler, Raphael or Carpaccio has left us the most satisfying beauty, or which was the greater musician, Wagner, Scarlatti or Beethoven, nor pronounce on the Bacon-Shakespeare controversy in any prescribed way, because we accept Socialism.|$|E
6000|$|His {{wife was}} prompt. [...] "By the women--that is by some obliging woman, of old, {{who was a}} {{descendant}} of the pushing man, the make-believe discoverer, and whom the Prince is therefore luckily able to refer to as an ancestress. A branch of the other family had become great--great enough, at least, to marry into his; {{and the name of}} the navigator, crowned with glory, was, very naturally, to become so the fashion among them that some son, of every generation, was appointed to wear it. <b>My</b> <b>point</b> <b>is,</b> at any rate, that I recall noticing at the time how the Prince was, from the start, helped with the dear Ververs by his wearing it. The connection became romantic for Maggie the moment she took it in; she filled out, in a flash, every link that might be vague. 'By that sign,' I quite said to myself, 'he'll conquer'--with his good fortune, of course, of having the other necessary signs too. It really," [...] said Mrs. Assingham, [...] "was, practically, the fine side of the wedge. Which struck me as also," [...] she wound up, [...] "a lovely note for the candour of the Ververs." ...|$|E
50|$|Over {{the next}} few years as I tried the ‘lose-weight-without-any-change’ method, as I wore ever tighter clothes, and weighed myself to depression, I felt doomed. <b>My</b> lowest <b>point</b> <b>was</b> the day I weighed myself after a haircut.|$|R
5000|$|... “…I’m {{surprised}} {{that this was}} taken {{in any other way}} then it <b>was</b> intended. <b>My</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> and I thought it was clear that in 2016 we as a people should not need such things to be on a shirt and they should be universal truths. We are all in this together. If you know the band and the lyrics and what we have always stood for this should be clear. Also look at the lyrics to “degradation” and “things we say” especially the line, “some people are so quick to judge let’s get the judgement straight”…” ...|$|R
