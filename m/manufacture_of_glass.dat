5|$|Glassmakers {{throughout}} history have experimented with glass fibers, but mass <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> fiber was only made {{possible with the}} invention of finer machine tooling. In 1893, Edward Drummond Libbey exhibited a dress at the World's Columbian Exposition incorporating glass fibers with the diameter and texture of silk fibers. Glass fibers can also occur naturally, as Pele's hair.|$|E
5|$|The town {{continued}} to grow in manufacturing capability. In 1792, the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop, Western Experiment. During the next decades, the yards produced other large boats. By the 19th century, they were building ocean-going vessels that shipped goods as far as Europe. In 1794, the town's first courthouse was built; it was a wooden structure on Market Square. In 1797, the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> began.|$|E

25|$|Sodium {{carbonate}} is soluble in water, and {{can occur}} naturally in arid regions, especially in mineral deposits (evaporites) formed when seasonal lakes evaporate.

25|$|Lead tetraoxide is {{most often}} used as a pigment for primer paints for iron objects. Due to its toxicity, its use is being limited. In the past, it was used in {{combination}} with linseed oil as a thick, long-lasting anti-corrosive paint. The combination of minium and linen fibres was also used for plumbing, now replaced with PTFE tape. Currently it is mostly used for <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass,</b> especially lead crystal glass. It finds limited use in some amateur pyrotechnics as a delay charge and {{was used in the}} past in the manufacture of dragon's egg pyrotechnic stars.|$|E
500|$|Potassium nitrate (...) or {{saltpeter}} {{is obtained}} from natural {{sources such as}} guano and evaporites or manufactured via the Haber process; it is the oxidant in gunpowder (black powder) and an important agricultural fertilizer. Potassium cyanide (KCN) is used industrially to dissolve copper and precious metals, in particular silver and gold, by forming complexes. Its applications include gold mining, electroplating, and electroforming of these metals; it is also used in organic synthesis to make nitriles. Potassium carbonate ( [...] or potash) {{is used in the}} <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass,</b> soap, color TV tubes, fluorescent lamps, textile dyes and pigments. Potassium permanganate (...) is an oxidizing, bleaching and purification substance and is used for production of saccharin. Potassium chlorate (...) is added to matches and explosives. Potassium bromide (KBr) was formerly used as a sedative and in photography.|$|E

Later, William III rested here on his march to London in 1688, at the nearby recently rebuilt Fawley Court, and received a deputation from the Lords. The town's period of prosperity in the 17th and 18th centuries was due to <b>manufactures</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> and malt, and trade in corn and wool. Henley-on-Thames supplied London with timber and grain.|$|R

2500|$|By far {{the largest}} {{consumption}} of sodium carbonate is in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass,</b> paper, rayon, soaps, and detergents. It is also used as a water softener, since carbonate can precipitate the calcium and magnesium ions present in [...] "hard" [...] water.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} uses of sodium carbonate. Sodium carbonate acts as a flux for silica, lowering the melting point of the mixture to something achievable without special materials. This [...] "soda glass" [...] is mildly water-soluble, so some calcium carbonate is added to the melt mixture to make the glass produced insoluble. This type of glass is known as soda lime glass: [...] "soda" [...] for the sodium carbonate and [...] "lime" [...] for the calcium carbonate. Soda lime glass has been the most common form of glass for centuries.|$|E

60|$|I {{have told}} you how the Venetians kept glass-making a secret, and how, at last, the Germans learned it, and then the French, and their work came to be better liked {{than that of the}} Venetians. But these last still managed to keep the process of making mirrors a {{profound}} secret, and the French were determined to get at the mystery. Several young glass-makers went from France to Venice, and applied to all the looking-glass makers of Venice for situations as workmen, that they might learn the art. But all positively refused to receive them, and kept their doors and windows tightly closed while they were at work, that no one might see what they did. The young Frenchmen took advantage of this, and climbed up on the roofs, and cautiously made holes through which they could look; and thus they learned the carefully-kept secret, and went back to France and commenced the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> mirrors. Twenty years after, a Frenchman invented founding glass, which gave France such a great advantage that the trade of Venice in looking-glasses was ruined.|$|E
6000|$|The <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> at Murano, {{of which}} the origin is so remote, {{may be said to}} form the only branch of {{industry}} which still flourishes in the lagoons. Muranese beads are exported to all quarters in vast quantities, and the process of making them {{is one of the things}} that strangers feel they must see when visiting Venice. The famous mirrors are no longer made, and the glass has deteriorated in quality, as well as in the beauty of the thousand curious forms it took. The test of the old glass, which is now imitated a great deal, is its extreme lightness. I suppose the charming notion that glass was once wrought at Murano of such fineness that it burst into fragments if poison were poured into it, must be fabulous. And yet it would have been an excellent thing in the good old toxicological days of Italy; and people of noble family would have found a sensitive goblet of this sort as sovereign against the arts of venomers as an exclusive diet of boiled eggs. The city of Murano has dwindled from thirty to five thousand in population. It is intersected by a system of canals like Venice, and has a Grand Canal of its own, of as stately breadth as that of the capital. The finer houses are built on this canal; but the beautiful palaces, once occupied in villeggiatura by the noble Venetians, are now inhabited by herds of poor, or converted into glass- works. The famous Cardinal Bembo and other literati made the island their retreat, and beautified it with gardens and fountains. Casa Priuli in that day was, according to Venetian ideas, [...] "a terrestrial Paradise," [...] and a proper haunt of [...] "nymphs and demi-gods." [...] But the wealth, the learning, and the elegance of former times, which planted [...] "groves of Academe" [...] at Murano, have passed away, and the fair pleasure-gardens are now weed-grown wastes, or turned into honest cabbage and potato patches. It is a poor, dreary little town, with an inexplicable charm in its decay. The city arms are still displayed upon the public buildings (for Murano was ruled, independently of Venice, by its own council); and the heraldic cock, with a snake in its beak, has yet a lusty and haughty air amid the ruin of the place.|$|E
