40|$|Air {{assisted}} {{delivery and}} distribution systems are more versatile for integration into plot seeders than gravity feed and mechanical distribution and delivery systems. This applies {{to a wide}} range of particulates when open-plan coulter layouts are used to improve residue passage during zero tillage and reduced tillage as well as for close row spacing on cultivated ground. It is a key component for up-grading older seeders in affordable and efficient ways to the multi-purpose Flexiseeder system, without substantially re-designing and re-building the original chassis. Likewise, it applies when you wish to broadcast fertilizers or other dry, granular materials, and also for operating at wider working widths than plot trials, including commercial agricultural and other operations. Smallaire, an Australian company already supplying large scale commercial agriculture, joined the Flexiseeder Project two years ago to help develop and supply “scaled down ” air delivery and distribution equipment in modular form, for small and <b>medium-sized</b> <b>farm,</b> horticulture, viticulture and plot seeders.

40|$|Conservation {{agriculture}} (CA) {{is promoted}} as a promising technology to stabilize or improve crop yields in Africa and Madagascar. However, small-scale farmers face difficulties to retain soil cover, {{mainly because of}} competing uses for the biomass produced, especially to feed cattle. To explore the relation between dairy production and CA we developed an optimisation model at farm level. Our aim was to explore trade-offs between CA practices {{and the size of}} dairy cow herds. Our model includes three main components: the farm, the crops and the cattle herd. The optimisation was made on the total net income for three years. Biomass produced by cropping activities can either serve as mulch or to feed cows. We applied a constraint on the minimum soil cover % to keep {{at the end of each}} year for CA fields: from 30 % to 95 %. We simulated two scenarios of milk market: a small milk market with low forage price and an open milk market scenario with higher price of forage. Three prototypes of farms were simulated with different proportion and size of four kinds of field. These three prototypes were: <b>medium-sized</b> <b>farm</b> with hillsides dominating, <b>medium-sized</b> <b>farm</b> with paddy fields dominating and small-sized farm with hillsides. Changing the degree of soil cover to be retained on CA plots did not significantly modify the total net farm income. It was more strongly influenced by the characteristics of the milk market. In case of a limited milk market it was not profitable to have more than seven cows because the expenses were not compensated by animal production. When setting minimum soil cover to 30 % then all of the simulated results include biomass coming from CA cropping system even with 12 cows/farm. Conversely when setting this constraint to 95 %, above 6 / 7 cows/farm forage come only from conventional fields. In all of the situations simulated even with 6 cows, with the current and twice the price for forage, it was possible to keep at least 50 % of soil cover on 30 - 60 % of the total farm area. CA was not feasible for farms with no irrigated paddy fields or when forage fetched a high price regardless of the constraint for % of soil cover to be kept on CA fields. Overall, CA systems can be beneficial for dairy cow farmers due to the forage produced, although the milk market and thus the value of biomass for forage, has a strong influence on CA practice at field level.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade {{millions}} {{of people have been}} able to leave poverty, increasing the regional demand for meat and livestock products. In combination with reforms in market and agricultural policy, this has led to an increase in pig production in sub-Saharan Africa, most notably in Uganda. The growing pig sector could be an important contributor to poverty reduction among smallholder pig keepers. However, the growing pig population has been followed by an increase in African swine fever (ASF) incidence. ASF is a contagious, typically very lethal, haemorrhagic, viral disease of domestic pigs. The overall goal of this doctoral project was to develop the understanding of ASF epidemiology in the smallholder setting in Uganda. Four studies were conducted in two districts in northern Uganda among smallholder farmers, other pig production value-chain actors, and a <b>medium-sized</b> <b>farm.</b> The studies included group- and individual interviews as well as biological and environmental sampling and testing for the virus. Data were analysed using semi-qualitative and quantitative methods. The thesis concluded that ASF was endemic in the study area, and that outbreaks could be detected using retrospective and real-time farmer reports. ASF outbreaks were associated with activities of humans, such as trade in pigs and pig products and free-range management systems. ASF outbreaks had long-term negative social and economic impact for pig production value-chain actors on all investigated levels in the value chain. For smallholder farmers, the impact was aggravated with increasing herd size. Trade and consumption of sick and dead pigs were commonly used as coping strategies. Farm-level biosecurity was insufficient for ASF protection and awareness of control methods did not guarantee their implementation. The continuous ASF transmission in the study area was not driven by lack of knowledge, but rather by cultural circumstances, taboos and poverty. Therefore, in order for control methods to be successfully and sustainably implemented, they need to be developed in participation with the communities, adapted to the local context, socially acceptable, flexible, and cost-effective...|$|E
40|$|Tropical {{areas of}} {{developing}} countries have significant potential for increased food production. In the case of Mexico, an important economic activity in the tropics is livestock production based on pasture. Tropical regions represent 25 % of the total area of Mexico and support more than 50 % of the country's cow production. Historically, however, animal production in Mexican, and other tropical areas, has been low. Low pasture utilisation, and associated poor herbage quality, is one factor that contributes to poor animal performance in the tropics. This situation contrasts {{with the success of}} New Zealand pastoral systems, which in comparative terms have been able to obtain high levels of animal production and efficient use of pasture. Differences in pasture productivity (both in quality and quantity) and social and economic conditions between the Mexican tropics and New Zealand are large. Nevertheless it was proposed that some of the pastoral farming methods used in New Zealand, could be adapted to the conditions of tropical farmers in Mexico, particularly in relation to effective planning and control of the farming system. To test this hypothesis, the consequences of implementing some of New Zealand's pastoral farming techniques under tropical conditions in Central Veracruz State were explored by developing a spreadsheet model to simulate local farming systems. The model included linked submodels for pasture growth and quality, livestock transactions, milk production and enterprise gross margins. The effect of improved farming systems of milk output and cash returns were evaluated relative to the average levels of performance currently achieved from a <b>medium-sized</b> <b>farm</b> in the Central region of Veracruz State in Mexico. Straight forward changes {{in the design of the}} farming system, such as synchronising calving with the pattern of pasture growth rather than year-round calving, would significantly affect milk production and cash returns to the farm family. The modelling process was seriously constrained by the lack of farm-level data on pasture production and animal performance. Nevertheless, the model framework clearly identifies which data should be collected, and priority should now be given to assembling these data so simulation decision support models such as that developed in this study, can be effectively used to plan improved farming systems.
