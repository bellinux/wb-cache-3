40|$|A large {{class of}} {{isolated}} quantum {{system in a}} pure state can equilibrate {{and serve as a}} heat bath. We show that once the equilibrium is reached, any of its subsystems that is much smaller than the isolated system is thermalized such that the subsystem is governed by the Gibbs distribution. Within this theoretical framework, the celebrated superposition principle of quantum mechanics leads to a prediction of a thermalized subsystem with <b>multiple</b> <b>temperatures</b> when the isolated system is in a superposition state of energy eigenstates of multiple distinct energy scales. This multiple-temperature state is at equilibrium, completely different from a non-equilibrium state that has <b>multiple</b> <b>temperatures</b> at different parts. Feasible experimental schemes to verify this prediction are discussed. Comment: 6 pages, 2 figure...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that for {{increasingly}} rarefied flowfields, the predictions from continuum formulation, such as the Navier-Stokes equations lose accuracy. For the high speed diatomic molecular flow in the transitional regime, the inaccuracies are partially attributed to the single temperature approximations in the Navier-Stokes equations. Here, we propose a continuum <b>multiple</b> <b>temperature</b> model based on the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) equation for the non-equilibrium flow computation. In the current model, the Landau-Teller-Jeans relaxation model for the rotational energy is used to evaluate the energy exchange between the translational and rotational modes. Due to the <b>multiple</b> <b>temperature</b> approximation, the second viscosity coefficient in the Navier-Stokes equations is replaced by the temperature relaxation term. In order to solve the <b>multiple</b> <b>temperature</b> kinetic model, a multiscale gas-kinetic finite volume scheme is proposed, where the gas-kinetic equation is numerically solved for the fluxes to update the macroscopic flow variables inside each control volume. Since the gas-kinetic scheme uses a continuous gas distribution function at a cell interface for the fluxes evaluation, the moments of a gas distribution function can be explicitly obtained for the <b>multiple</b> <b>temperature</b> model. Therefore, the kinetic scheme is much more efficient than the DSMC method, especially in the near continuum flow regime. For the non-equilibrium flow computations, i. e., the nozzle flow and hypersonic rarefied flow over flat plate, the computational results are validated in comparison with experimental measurements and DSMC solutions.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the self-assembly of scaled-up versions of arbitrary finite shapes. We {{work in the}} <b>multiple</b> <b>temperature</b> model that was introduced by Aggarwal, Cheng, Goldwasser, Kao, and Schweller (Complexities for Generalized Models of Self-Assembly, SODA 2004). The <b>multiple</b> <b>temperature</b> model is a natural generalization of Winfree’s abstract tile assembly model, where the temperature of a tile system is allowed to be shifted {{up and down as}} self-assembly proceeds. We first exhibit two constant-size tile sets in which scaled-up versions of arbitrary shapes self-assemble. Our first tile set has the property that each scaled shape self-assembles via an asymptotically “Kolmogorov-optimum ” temperature sequence but the scaling factor grows with the size of the shape being assembled. In contrast, our second tile set assembles each scaled shape via a temperature sequence whose length is proportional to the number of points in the shape but the scaling factor is a constant independent of the shape being assembled. We then show that there is no constant-size tile set that can uniquely assemble an arbitrary (non-scaled, connected) shape in the <b>multiple</b> <b>temperature</b> model, i. e., the scaling is necessary for self-assembly. This answers an open question of Kao and Schweller (Reducing Tile Complexity for Self-Assembly Through Temperature Programming, SODA 2006), who asked whether such a tile set existed...|$|R

40|$|In {{an early}} approach, we {{proposed}} a kinetic model with <b>Multiple</b> translational <b>temperature</b> [K. Xu, H. Liu and J. Jiang, Phys. Fluids 19, 01, 6101 (2007) ]. Based on this model, the stress strain relationship in the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations is replaced by the translational temperature relaxation terms. The kinetic model has been successfully used in both continuum and near continuum flow computations. In this paper, we will further validate the <b>multiple</b> translational <b>temperature</b> kinetic model to flow problems in multiple dimensions. First, a generalized boundary condition incorporating the physics of Knudsen layer will be introduced into the model. Second, the direct particle collision with the wail will be considered as well for the further modification of particle collision time, subsequently a new effective viscosity coefficient will be defined. In order to apply the kinetic model to near continuum flow computations, the gas-kinetic scheme will be constructed. The first example is the pressure-driven Poiseuille flow at Knudsen number 0. 1, where the anomalous phenomena between {{the results of the}} NS equations and the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method will be resolved through the <b>Multiple</b> <b>temperature</b> model. The so-called Burnett-order effects can be captured as well by algebraic temperature relaxation terms. Another test case is the force-driven Poiseuille flow at various Knudsen numbers. With the effective viscosity approach and the generalized second-order slip boundary condition, the Knudsen minimum can be accurately obtained. The current study indicates that it is useful to use <b>multiple</b> <b>temperature</b> concept to model the non-equilibrium state in near continuum flow limit. In the continuum flow regime, the <b>multiple</b> <b>temperature</b> model will automatically recover the single temperature NS equations due to the efficient energy exchange in different directions...|$|R
40|$|Dynamical averages {{based on}} functionals of {{dynamical}} trajectories, such as time-correlation functions, {{play an important}} role in determining kinetic or transport properties of matter. At temperatures of interest, the expectations of these quantities are often dominated by contributions from rare events, making the precise calculation of these quantities by molecular dynamics simulation difficult. Here, we present a reweighting method for combining simulations from <b>multiple</b> <b>temperatures</b> (or from simulated or parallel tempering simulations) to compute an optimal estimate of the dynamical properties at the temperature of interest without the need to invoke an approximate kinetic model (such as the Arrhenius law). Continuous and differentiable estimates of these expectations at any temperature in the sampled range can also be computed, along with an assessment of the associated statistical uncertainty. For rare events, aggregating data from <b>multiple</b> <b>temperatures</b> can produce an estimate with the desired precision at greatly reduced computational cost compared with simulations conducted at a single temperature. Here, we describe use of the method for the canonical (NVT) ensemble using four common models of dynamics (canonical distribution of Hamiltonian trajectories, Andersen thermostatting, Langevin, and overdamped Langevin or Brownian dynamics), but it can be applied to any thermodynamic ensemble provided the ratio of path probabilities at different temperatures can be computed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a gas-kinetic scheme {{to solve the}} <b>multiple</b> <b>temperature</b> kinetic model (MTKM), which was proposed in J. Comput. Math. 29 (6) (2011) 639 - 660, {{for the study of}} non-equilibrium flows. The MTKM is a two-stage particle collision model possessing an intermediate quasi-equilibrium state with a symmetric second-order temperature tensor. A gas-kinetic finite volume scheme is developed for the numerical solution of the MTKM in the continuum and transition flow regimes. The gas-kinetic scheme is designed for the updating of macroscopic variables, which include the conservative flow variables and the <b>multiple</b> <b>temperature</b> field. In order to validate the kinetic model, the gas-kinetic scheme is used in the study of lid-driven cavity flows in both continuum and transition flow regimes. The numerical results predicted by the MTKM are compared with those from the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE), and the early three-temperature kinetic model (TFKM) proposed in Phys. Fluids 19, 016101 (2007). It is demonstrated that the MTKM has obvious advantages in comparison with the NSE and the TTKM in capturing the non-equilibrium flow behavior in the transition flow regime. One distinguishable phenomenon captured by the MTKM is that in the transition flow regime the heat flux direction can be from a low temperature to a high temperature region, which violates the Fourier's law of continuum flows. The MTKM provides a more accurate physical model than the NSE for the non-equilibrium flows. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
