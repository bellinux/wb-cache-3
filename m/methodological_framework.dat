25|$|Net {{zero-energy}} building: Based {{on scientific}} analysis within the joint research program “Towards Net Zero Energy Solar Buildings” a <b>methodological</b> <b>framework</b> {{was set up}} which allows different definitions, in accordance with country’s political targets, specific (climate) conditions and respectively formulated requirements for indoor conditions: The overall conceptual understanding of a Net ZEB is an energy efficient, grid connected building enabled to generate energy from renewable sources to compensate its own energy demand (see figure 1).The wording “Net” emphasizes the energy exchange between {{the building and the}} energy infrastructure. By the building-grid interaction, the Net ZEBs becomes an active part of the renewable energy infrastructure. This connection to energy grids prevents seasonal energy storage and oversized on-site systems for energy generation from renewable sources like in energy autonomous buildings. The similarity of both concepts is a pathway of two actions: 1) reduce energy demand by means of energy efficiency measures and passive energy use; 2) generate energy from renewable sources. However, the Net ZEBs grid interaction and plans to widely increase their numbers evoke considerations on increased flexibility in the shift of energy loads and reduced peak demands.|$|E
25|$|Eye {{movement}} in reading involves the visual processing of written text. This {{was described by}} the French ophthalmologist Louis Émile Javal in the late 19th century. He reported that eyes do not move continuously along a line of text, but make short, rapid movements (saccades) intermingled with short stops (fixations). Javal's observations were characterised by a reliance on naked-eye observation of eye {{movement in}} the absence of technology. From the late 19th to the mid-20th century, investigators used early tracking technologies to assist their observation, in a research climate that emphasised the measurement of human behaviour and skill for educational ends. Most basic knowledge about eye movement was obtained during this period. Since the mid-20th century, there have been three major changes: the development of non-invasive eye-movement tracking equipment; the introduction of computer technology to enhance the power of this equipment to pick up, record and process the huge volume of data that eye movement generates; and the emergence of cognitive psychology as a theoretical and <b>methodological</b> <b>framework</b> within which reading processes are examined. Sereno & Rayner (2003) believed that the best current approach to discover immediate signs of word recognition is through the recordings of eye movements and event-related potential.|$|E

The paper then proposes <b>methodological</b> <b>frameworks</b> and data collection techniques to extend research in this area. Method. A {{review of the literature}} related to the public sphere and public libraries is conducted to identify research gaps and develop promising research approaches. Analysis. Previous literature is analyzed according to epistemological and ontological approaches. Results. Existing literature related to the public sphere and public libraries exhibits epistemological and ontological shortcomings. Empirical studies are relatively few and existing studies remain tied to a limited public sphere concept. Conclusion. Two new <b>methodological</b> <b>frameworks</b> are proposed to guide future work in this area. One framework is the circulation of power model; the other framework is a custom-built model with multiple axes and dimensions...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} an argument {{on the application}} of theoretical and <b>methodological</b> <b>frameworks</b> {{to the study of}} identity from an autoethnographic perspective. In order to guide the analysis process, the author employed social constructionism as the main theoretical foundation, whereas thematic analysis and positioning theory were deployed as the <b>methodological</b> <b>frameworks.</b> Further, in the process of using ethnographic methods to study the identity of Russian immigrants to New Zealand, the author found herself also needing to use autoethnography to interrogate and understand her own journey. The insider/outsider position of the author who belongs to the same minority group became the most vital tool in her identity construction. In this regard, it is impossible to engage fully with the autoethnographic research practice without understanding the impact of others on identity construction of self, and a strong theoretical and methodological scholarship can provide a valuable foundation for this process...|$|R
