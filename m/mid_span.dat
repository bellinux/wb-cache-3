40|$|The Götaälv Bridge in Gothenburg was {{instrumented}} with {{strain gauges}} in April 2015. This report is {{a presentation of}} the measurements performed until 29 April. The measurements were performed by personnel from the Division of Structural Engineering and Bridges at KTH. The project was commissioned by the City of Gothenburg – Traffic & public transport authority through ÅF Infrastructure AB and performed in collaboration with researchers from the Division of Structural Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology. The monitoring system comprised 23 strain gauges divided between two areas. One between support 13 and 14 at the South Viaduct and one between support III and IV at the elevated river part. Measurements were performed at four arranged bridge openings and a calibration monitoring using two trucks with known weights. Continuous measurement was also performed during the afternoon Tuesday 28 April. For the bridge openings, stresses up to 5, 6 MPa were recorded on the elevated river part. The recorded stresses are lower than those caused by the ordinary traffic in the instrumented locations. The calibration measurements were performed during night using two trucks with weights of 25, 0 tons and 25, 1 tons, respectively. Together, they caused maximum recorded stresses of 15, 4 MPa for the South Viaduct and 16, 8 MPa for the elevated river part. Associated stress ranges were 19, 4 MPa and 19, 8 MPa, respectively. The largest values were recorded in the gauges located close to the <b>mid</b> <b>spans.</b> Stress range spectra are presented for the short term continuous measurement. The daily traffic gives in general lower stress ranges than the trucks used for the calibration. A large portion of the cycles are distributed over small stress ranges. For the gauges on the elevated bridge part, the analyses show a significant influence of dynamics on the results. QC 20160129 </p...|$|R
30|$|Hence, an {{observed}} assertion {{was made}} that points of inflections of all members of VG of US occur at their <b>mid</b> <b>spans</b> during the elastic as well as plastic stages of loading. This is an acceptable presumption with inconsequential margins of error since the solution becomes more accurate and eventually exact as plasticity spreads over {{all members of the}} structure. These observations form the essence of the optimization philosophies that lead to the minimum weight design of regular moment frames including parallel chord VG. Likewise, the indispensible association of the mid-span points of inflection with the exact minimum weight design conditions immensely facilitates the comprehension and mathematical formulation of the problem. In addition, an observation has been made that in almost all types of traditionally designed frameworks, the drift angle due to racking effects is generally a maximum near the supports and a minimum near the location of maximum displacement (Taranath 1998). This suggests that it would be prudent to first alleviate the possibility of premature formation of plastic hinges within the first and last bays of the frame, minimize large drift angles near the supports and then work sideways to control the displacements of the remaining bays or modules. The anticipated single collapse mechanisms of structures of US have more than one degree of kinematic freedom and can be construed as being composed of several merging failure patterns. Structures of US almost invariably fail through a state of over-complete collapse. The likelihood of over-complete collapse, suggests that the sequences of formations of the plastic hinges may be controlled {{in such a way as}} to prevent the formation of plastic hinges in the vertical members until the first sets of hinges form in the desired locations of the horizontal elements. Similarly it would be possible to delay the formation of plastic hinges at the critical ends of the horizontal members until the complete failure of all vertical members. Moment control technologies, such as added flange plates and/or reduced beam sections can be employed to induce any mode of collapse and sequence of formation of plastic hinges, without noticeably affecting the ultimate load carrying and/or displacement development capacity of the structure.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a parametric study of the flexural behavior of continuous concrete members prestressed with external tendons. The behavior at ultimate limit states is evaluated. A nonlinear analysis model, based on the three dimensional finite element method, ANSYS computer program (10. 0) was used. The nonlinear material and geometrical analysis were adopted. The results obtained show good agreement with experimental results. This research was carried out to study the effects of several factors on the overall behavior of externally prestressed beams in terms of the values of compressive concrete strength and effective prestressing stress. That behavior was slightly affected compared with experimental results. The undeviated external tendons mobilized lower nominal flexural resistance and inelastic deflection than deviated tendons did. The increase in the beam capacity in the beam subjected to loads at the third span is greater than in the beam with a single load at the <b>mid</b> – <b>span.</b> The result of increasing the effective depth is that the ultimate load capacity is essentially increased...|$|R

40|$|According to {{the codes}} of {{practice}} for design of concrete structures, the effect of solar radiation has to be given due consideration. However, it is not specifically incorporated in the structural design. Often providing expansion or sliding joints is the common practice to accommodate the effect of solar radiation. The need to provide reinforcement bars at tensile stress regions where thermal stresses may develop within the design life of the structure is currently an undocumented fact. Therefore the main aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the significance of solar radiation effect on concrete water retaining structures and to highlight the occurrence of high stress zones that need attention. The investigation was performed using a finite element model with gathered solar radiation data. The model was simulated with probable thermal properties of concrete and environmental conditions including solar heat flux, to identify the governing parameters. In order to process large amounts of data and for economic reasons, a finite element method of analysis using ANSYS software was considered. This provided the robustness and contributed to focus on the sensitivity of the parameters under investigation. Further, several simplified models were verified with numerical calculations and compared with the finite element model. Characteristic points on stress response curve from the finite element analysis were compared with the numerical results. Comparisons were made with respect to the accuracy and reliability of using the finite element model for the analysis. Based on the verified modeling approach, a typical underground water tank was investigated for sliding and fixed roof slab to wall connectivity. The temperature variation and corresponding stress variations were obtained. It was found that significantly high tensile stresses are developed at the soffit level of the roof slab near the column heads, where normally only compressive stresses are expected. This occurs for both fixed and sliding roof slab-to-wall connections. Also at the <b>mid</b> <b>spans,</b> as the top surface of the roof slab was being compressed due to thermal expansion, the bottom surface was not being compressed due to the comparatively low temperature than the top surface (i. e. the temperature gradient). Therefore the bottom fibers developed tensile stresses, which was significantly more than the tensile stress due to selfweight only. It is conclusive that the solar radiation is significant on concrete water retaining structures and the use of sliding or fixity conditions between the roof slab and wall is not effective in minimizing the tensile stresses due to solar heat gain...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} was to deal with overall behaviour of reinforced concrete deep beams with openings strengthened and un-strengthened by carbon fiber reinforced polymer at the shear span near support. The major objectives of the research are to determine the load-deflection curve, crack pattern and effects of opening shape for each beam with and without CFRP strengthening as well as identifying the most effective strengthening method. Due to limited research in numerical approach, this {{research was}} conducted by validating the finite element modelling results with experimental results. A total of eleven (11) beams with dimension of 120 x 600 x 2400 mm were modelled as simply supported beams in three-dimensional (31)) analysis by using finite element program, Ansys 12. 0. In the research, two (2) types of opening shapes, rectangular (270 x 600 mm) and circularised rectangular (270 x 330 mm, 0 270 mm) openings were placed at the <b>mid</b> shear <b>span</b> of the beams. In addition, reinforcement used was 2 T 16 for bottom bar, 2 T 10 for top bar, R 6 - 300 c/c for shear link and R 6 - 150 c/c for riser bar. Based on the analytical results, all the beams were failed in shear mode with cracking diagonally from the support to the sharp edge of the rectangular opening and around the circular edge of circularised rectangular opening.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesised}} that several microbial processes contribute to mucilage formation and transformation. However, to date, {{none of these}} mechanisms have been consistently tested using different types of mucilage. We investigated the biochemical composition and the microbial activities occurring in 9 different types of mucilage aggregates (macroflocs, stringers, cobwebs, ribbons, stringers/cobwebs clouds, big creamy surface layer, false bottoms and anoxic false bottoms) collected during summer 2000, 2002 and 2003 in the Adriatic Sea. Larger and aged aggregates, characterized by the accumulation of carbohydrate and a low lipid fraction, displayed significant biochemical differences when compared with younger aggregates. Prokaryote abundance, C production and extracellular enzymatic activities increased from small to medium-sized aggregates (corresponding approximately to <b>mid</b> life <b>span)</b> while they decreased in larger (and aged) aggregates. The highest prokaryotic C production and enzymatic activities were coupled with highest viral abundance. In mucilage displaying the highest viral abundance a reduced incorporation of enzymatically degraded C into prokaryote biomass was observed. This result suggests a potential involvement of viruses in the impairment of the microbial loop functioning in marine aggregates. Applying a multivariate analysis to the microbial variables, 3 stages of mucilage life span can be identified: (1) an early stage characterized by a large prokaryote colonization of the aggregate and DOM accumulation; (2) a mature stage characterized by a decreased capability of incorporating degraded C into prokaryote biomass and high viral abundance and (3) an aged stage characterized by the decrease in both viral and prokaryote abundance and prokaryote activity.

40|$|The {{last four}} decades {{of the nineteenth century}} {{witnessed}} a significant growth of leisure hours for a growing number of South Australians, particularly working class males; it was accompanied by an upsurge in both organised and informal recreation activity. The upsurge owed much to major advances in communication during the period – in transport by rail, steamship and late in the century, the bicycle, to the network of telegraph stations which by the <b>mid</b> 1870 s, <b>spanned</b> much of the colony, the country and finally linked the colony to much of the wider world, and to the growth of local and daily newspapers and specialist journals. Industry, government and commerce drove these advances, but recreation benefited from all of them and came to be a major element of commercial activity itself, as some activities generated not only participants, but spectators and audiences. These developments in turn stimulated a demand for facilities, both indoor and outdoor, which came to be met by private groups, public authorities and commercial operators, or combinations of the three. However, not all sections of the South Australian community looked favourably on aspects of these developments. Some social, religious and political forces, both separately and later as an alliance, combined to target elements of the recreation activities which emerged within the new leisure, particularly those of the working classes. They feared a return to public disorder arising from unseemly and licentious behaviour which accompanied many of the activities of the occasional pre-industrial seasonal leisure periods. These forces drew on contemporary programs in America and Britain in their campaign to quell ‘social evils’ including intemperance, gambling and what they regarded as inappropriate behaviour on Sundays, the Lord’s Day. They advocated the uses of statutes to constrain, if not eliminate what many in the community regarded as acceptable recreational activity. Others from the reforming forces determined on ‘rationalising’ the recreation of the working classes by introducing programs which they regarded as educational and self-improving, based essentially on their own middle class experience. A further restraint were contemporary conventions which determined matters of dress, conduct and behavioural expectations affecting areas of recreational activities; they were particularly severe on women. Other conventions affected full participation by men in a small number of sporting activities. The thesis examines the origin, nature and conduct of these forces in South Australia each of which sought to discipline aspects of mainly working class recreation of the period. It concludes with an assessment of the outcomes as they appeared at the time of Federation. Thesis (Ph. D.) - University of Adelaide, School of History and Politics, 201...|$|R
