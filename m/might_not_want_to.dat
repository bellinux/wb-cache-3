5|$|Although {{she writes}} under the pen name J. K. Rowling (pronounced rolling), her name, before her remarriage, was simply Joanne Rowling. Anticipating that the target {{audience}} of young boys <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> read a book written by a woman, her publishers asked that she use two initials rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose K (for Kathleen) as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother. She calls herself Jo. Following her remarriage, she has sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence {{under the name of}} Joanne Kathleen Rowling and her entry in Who's Who lists her name also as Joanne Kathleen Rowling.|$|E

25|$|In 1923, {{after the}} failed Beer Hall Putsch, Hitler, {{who had been}} imprisoned for treason, {{appointed}} Rosenberg {{as the leader of}} the National Socialist movement, a position he held until Hitler's release. Hitler remarked privately in later years that his choice of Rosenberg, whom he regarded as weak and lazy, was strategic; Hitler did not want the temporary leader of the Nazis to become too popular or hungry for power, because a person with either of those two qualities <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> cede the party leadership after Hitler's release. However, at the time of the appointment Hitler had no reason to believe that he would soon be released, and Rosenberg had not appeared weak, so this may have been Hitler reading back into history his dissatisfaction with Rosenberg for the job he did.|$|E

[...] In spite of his statement, the senator did want to run the campaign, but McKinley (who apparently saw an opportunity to show the public that he was not Hanna's creature) was slow to ask him. [...] This was a source of great stress to Hanna, who was concerned about the campaign and his relationship with McKinley; the senator fainted in his office during the wait and may have suffered a heart attack. [...] In late May, the President announced that Hanna would run his campaign. Margaret Leech suggested that McKinley was angry at Hanna for unknown reasons, thus the President's [...] "uncharacteristic coldness". [...] Morgan, on the other hand, wrote that [...] "the president was using his usual indirect pressure and the power of silence. [...] He wanted and needed Hanna, but on his own terms." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{production}} of the [...] episode [...] "A Simple Investigation", it was decided to insert the scene that Behr and Wolfe had previously created. Behr mused at the time that while Sinatra <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> portray the character, perhaps someone similar to Steve Lawrence would. Behr named the character Vic Fontaine, a combination of two names he had been planning to use for some time. It was not until some time later that Behr noticed a similarity in naming between the new character and one from the 1972 film The Godfather. But Lawrence was unavailable and the scene proved too long {{to be included in the}} episode, so once again the idea was put on hold. Behr was unsure how to write the character into the show until it became apparent that it could be included as part of the Odo/Kira Nerys relationship after Kira found out about Odo's feelings for her in the episode [...] "Children of Time". Rather than film an individual scene, he decided that an entire 1960s-era Las Vegas themed episode should be created, resulting in {{the production}} of [...] "His Way".|$|E
500|$|Though Bobby is [...] "fairly content, {{at least}} on the surface, to be alone in the world", he slowly comes to be a {{surrogate}} father for Sam and Dean. On this relationship, Beaver feels that [...] "Bobby's concerned about them both, with Dean's sense of self, but there's a sort of undercurrent of worry about Sam. Sam seems to have more of the heart of darkness about him than Dean does... I just sense that there's this ongoing watchful eye that Bobby's got on Sam." [...] Although he loves each of them [...] "like a son", Bobby is willing to allow the brothers to put themselves in harm's way if it is absolutely necessary. For example, when Dean wants to detoxify Sam from his addiction to demon blood in [...] "When the Levee Breaks", Bobby instead points out that Sam giving in to his demonic abilities could help him to prevent Lucifer's return, even though the amount of blood required to kill Lilith would [...] "change [...] forever". Beaver noted, [...] "Bobby is old enough that he's fairly clear-headed about what the priorities ought to be. Bobby's position is, more or less, 'if you have a family member with a drinking problem and you want to stage an intervention, you <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do it in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina.'" ...|$|E

[...] He said, [...] "She's foulmouthed, abrasive and suffers absolutely nothing gladly. Yet, as always, her own foibles crack her {{up as much}} as they do her boyfriend or visiting eldest son. The fact that she's completely unafraid to hold herself up to ridicule endears her to her audience". [...] He also noted that a reality show format [...] "probably fits Barr better than, say, another sitcom [...] ". He ended his review saying, [...] "The wild pigs <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> stick around, but the rest of us should be willing to give Roseanne's Nuts a shot for a few episodes, at least. [...] Scott D. Pierce of The Salt Lake Tribune said in his review, [...] "As reality shows go, Roseanne's Nuts is pretty mild. Oh, she's bleeped a lot. And there's some blurring of nudity. (Ick.) But mostly it's just Roseanne being Roseanne on a macadamia nut farm".|$|E

50|$|WuDunn and Kristoff {{make the}} claim that if girls were allowed to garner an {{education}} {{they would be able}} to prosper. At this point in time however, it is preferred for boys to go to school than girls because it is believed that they will actually be able to make something out of themselves. Many families have to choose between which of their kids with gain an education because uniforms and school fees might be hard to keep up with if every child goes to school. Girls might also work early on, preventing them from school. Education for girls is also shamed by communities because they fear what an educated woman can do. Some men <b>might</b> <b>not</b> even <b>want</b> <b>to</b> marry an educated woman due to the fear that they will be deemed as inferior to her.|$|R
5000|$|An American bioethicist {{and medical}} historian, Jacob M.

[...] Appel has written: [...] I cannot say whether more Alabama women own vibrators than own Bibles. If I were guessing, I would suspect that a majority derive more use out of the vibrators. Certainly more pleasure. Nor does there appear to be any remotely rational basis for keeping sex toys {{out of the hands of}} married adults, or single adults, or even children. Now that we are relatively confident that masturbation does not make little girls go blind, or cause palms to sprout hair, exposure to sex toys shouldn't harm them.

50|$|SSM {{is similar}} to many {{products}} in its class and offers some termination protection, process filtering, blocking of driver installs etc. What separates it from most HIPS programs is that it offers not just process filtering but also parent-child control of processes.

For example, while you might <b>want</b> <b>to</b> allow Windows explorer to start your web browser, you <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> other processes <b>to</b> start up your browser because they might exploit the browser to phone home.

40|$|Paulina Bren has {{produced}} a witty and thought-provoking analysis of Czechoslovak culture during ‘Normalisation’, the years which followed the forced ending to the 1968 Prague Spring. The ‘TV’ in the title is Communist-controlled Czechoslovak state television of the 1970 s and 1980 s. The ‘greengrocer’ is the compliant Czechoslovak Everyman (as described in Václav Havel's essay ‘The Power of the Powerless’) who unthinkingly places the slogan ‘Workers of the World Unite’ in his shop window, thereby subtly increasing the pressure on his fellow-citizens similarly {{to conform to the}} norms of the ‘post-totalitarian’ regime under which they live. As in the story of the Emperor's new clothes, the implication in Havel's essay, which was written in 1978, is that the entire edifice of Communist power would crumble the moment that ordinary people chose to stop colluding with the regime's official lies and opted instead to ‘live in truth’. Bren's fresh look at Czechoslovakia in the 1970 s helps to explain why they <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do so...|$|R

Sure {{that he would be}} drafted upon completion of his studies, Dundes joined the ROTC and trained to become a naval communications officer. When {{it turned out that the}} ship he was to be posted to, stationed in the Bay of Naples, already had a communications officer, Dundes asked what else that ship <b>might</b> need, <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> give up such a choice assignment. He then spent two years maintaining artillery guns on a ship in the Mediterranean. Upon completion of his service, Dundes attended Indiana University to pursue a Ph.D in folklore. At Indiana, he studied under the father of American Folklore, Richard Dorson. He quickly established himself as a force to be reckoned with in the field of folkloristics. He completed his degree very quickly and went on to a teaching position at the University of Kansas where he stayed for only a year before being offered a position in the University of California, Berkeley anthropology department teaching folklore. Dundes held this position for 42 years, until his death in 2005.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{integrity}} of the civil servants needs to be greatly improved in order to turn Malaysian Vision 2020 into a reality. This objective {{of this research was}} to determine the level of awareness, knowledge and understanding on noble values particularly integrity among selected civil servants in selected State Government agencies in Pulau Pinang, Malaysia. The respondents were selected based on a purposive sampling technique. The research used a quantitative approach where self-administered structured questions were distributed. Descriptive and inference analysis were carried out to meet the research objectives outlined. The research findings showed that there were civil servants groups who were unclear and uncertain about the meaning of integrity in public sector. Those with shorter length of services were found to be less knowledgeable on the rule and procedure which led to them being unsure about integrity. Length of service was found to be inversely related to the perception on the knowledge of integrity, corruption and quality of service delivery. In this research, respondents might or <b>might</b> have <b>not</b> disclosed the actual truth when answering questions. Most heads of departments <b>might</b> have <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> disclose actual work realities of their offices. They, in particular, did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> wash their dirty linen in public. For that reason, future research may improve on such limitation...|$|R

If she did not persuade him to go he <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go for a while, as he had written--"just yet." [...] Carley grew troubled in mind. Such mental disturbance, however, lasted no longer than her return with Glenn to camp, where the mustang Spillbeans stood ready for her to mount.

Of course, he might get to Jamaica just as soon, and perhaps sooner, if he sailed with us, but we don't know it! We may be delayed in some way; there're lots of things that might happen, and anyway, I don't believe in interfering with orders, and I know Shirley doesn't either.

500|$|It {{had also}} been some time since a Copland piece had been {{appreciated}} widely by audiences. His opera The Tender Land had not fared well, either in its original or revised forms. Choreographer Jerome Robbins never produced Copland's ballet Dance Panels, {{despite the fact that}} he had commissioned it. None of his major orchestral works from the 1960s—Connotations, Music for a Great City, Emblems and Inscape—made much of an impact with audiences. Nor do they fit in either the populist or modernist parts of Copland's compositional output. [...] Copland was aware that dodecaphonism did not hold as high a place as it had previously and writes, [...] "By the sixties, serialism had been around for over fifty years; young composers were not so fascinated with it anymore." [...] Nonetheless, he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be pigeonholed.
