40|$|Vegetable oil has {{significant}} {{potential as a}} base fluid and substitute for <b>mineral</b> oil for <b>grease</b> formulation. Vegetable oils are promising candidates as base fluid for eco-friendly lubricants because of their excellent lubricity, biodegradability, viscosity-temperature characteristic and low volatility. This paper presents the effective and ability of grease by using natural material. Performance characteristics of greases used for industrial and automotive application are largely depending on the hardness. Grease hardness was determined using standard test methods. Results indicate that the fume silica percent in formulated grease are directly proportional to the viscosity and drop point. There is no drop point at 310 °C occur more than 10 %wt of fume silica. Also, the grease didn’t show {{negative effect on the}} metal surface. Therefore, developed greases can be a good substitute for <b>mineral</b> oil-based <b>greases</b> in industrial, agriculture, forestry and marine application...|$|R
40|$|Reversibly photoswitchable {{fluorescent}} proteins find growing {{applications in}} cell biology, yet mechanistic details, in particular on the ultrafast photochemical time scale, remain unknown. We employed time-resolved pump-probe absorption spectroscopy on the reversibly photoswitchable fluorescent protein IrisFP in solution to study photoswitching from the nonfluorescent (off) to the fluorescent (on) state. Evidence is {{provided for the}} existence of several intermediate states on the pico- and microsecond time scales that are attributed to chromophore isomerization and proton transfer, respectively. Kinetic modeling favors a sequential mechanism with the existence of two excited state intermediates with lifetimes of 2 and 15 ps, the second of which controls the photoswitching quantum yield. In order to support that IrisFP is suited for time-resolved experiments aiming at a structural characterization of these ps intermediates, we used serial femtosecond crystallography at an X-ray free electron laser and solved the structure of IrisFP in its on state. Sample consumption was minimized by embedding crystals in <b>mineral</b> <b>grease,</b> in which they remain photoswitchable. Our spectroscopic and structural results pave the way for time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography aiming at characterizing the structure of ultrafast intermediates in reversibly photoswitchable fluorescent proteins...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the deep drawing of C-rail {{experimental}} benchmark, which has a complex deformation path. The influence of various lubricants, including the dry friction, low and high viscosity <b>mineral</b> oil, semisolid <b>grease</b> and PTFE film on the drawability of dual-phase steel sheets, was performed. The digital image correlation technique was applied for component tests {{as well as the}} deformation analysis. The drawability was experimentally assessed by comparing surface roughness, thickness reduction, and springback of drawn component. The experimental results indicate that the interfacial lubrication between tools and work-piece plays an important role on the drawability of advanced high strength steel sheets. The quality of component was improved obviously by using PTFE film compared to the other lubricants...|$|R
5000|$|Fluoroelastomer (FKM): {{noted for}} their very high {{resistance}} to heat and {{a wide variety of}} chemicals. Other key benefits include excellent resistance to aging and ozone, very low gas permeability {{and the fact that the}} materials are self-extinguishing. Standard FKM materials have excellent resistance to <b>mineral</b> oils and <b>greases,</b> aliphatic, aromatic and chlorinated hydrocarbons, fuels, non-flammable hydraulic fluids (HFD) and many organic solvents and chemicals. Generally not resistant to hot water, steam, polar solvents, glycol-based brake fluids and low molecular weight organic acids. In addition to the standard FKM materials, a number of specialty materials with different monomer compositions and fluorine content (65% to 71%) are available that offer improved chemical or temperature resistance and/or better low temperature performance.|$|R

40|$|Waste {{palm oil}} {{manufacturing}} has significant {{potential as a}} base fluid and thickener agent for grease formulation. Vegetable oils are promising candidates as base fluid for eco-friendly lubricants because of their excellent lubricity, biodegradability, viscosity-temperature characteristic and low volatility. Spent bleaching earth is suitable for the substitute for thickener agent in grease formulation. This paper presents the effective and ability of grease by using natural material. Performance characteristics of greases used for industrial and automotive application are largely depending on the hardness. Grease hardness was determined using standard test methods. Results indicate that the percent combining spent bleaching earth with fume silica in formulated grease are directly proportional with temperature weight loss but it has indirectly proportional to the penetration value and percent ash content (wt%).

50|$|Synthetic valve oils {{have become}} more readily available. Characteristics of {{synthetic}} valve oil include, but are not necessarily limited to, greater compatibility with other related oils without chemical reactions (some types of mineral based oils or their additives were known to react with each other, forming thick solids - this required disassembly and complete cleaning of the valves to restore operation), slow evaporation or total lack of evaporation resulting in fewer oilings required, and less dissipation on contact with moisture inside the valve. Some synthetics have the additional advantage {{that they do not}} act as thinners for <b>mineral</b> based slide <b>greases</b> (previously, <b>mineral</b> based valve oil inserted into a valve by way of a tuning slide could carry some slide grease with it, fouling the valve). Finally, high-viscosity synthetic oils can increase valve compression and improve feel in instruments with worn valves, returning such instruments to playable condition.|$|R
40|$|Vegetable oils have {{significant}} {{potential as a}} base fluid and a substitute for <b>mineral</b> oil for <b>grease</b> formulation. The objective {{of this research is}} to produce grease from waste cooking oil via saponification of a stearic acid with a lithium hydroxide monohydrate, LiOH. In this research, preparation and formulation of bio-based grease and determination of optimum operating condition were studied. The produced bio-based grease is expected to have better performance, and apply in variety industry such as agriculture/farming, forestry applications and food processing. The stearic acid, lithium hydroxide monohydrate and waste cooking oil compositions were manipulated in this research. The operating temperature and mixing period were also studied. The characteristics of produced grease were analyzed in order to evaluate the performance of the grease. Among parameters analyzed were depth penetration test, dropping point and oxidation stability. While grease hardness was determined using depth penetration test, and their oxidative stabilities was determined using copper corrosion test. The dropping point temperature was tested using dropping point apparatus. Results indicate that the lithium hydroxide monohydrate, stearic acid and waste cooking oil content significantly affect grease hardness, oxidative stability and dropping point temperature.

40|$|This project {{tested at}} the field scale, five on-site, {{non-proprietary}} bioremediation processes on weathered petroleum hydrocarbons from a fire fighter training area. Two bioremediation processes based on fungi (commercially produced white rot fungus, Pleurotus ostreatus, and aged, coarse wood chips, 'compost', with naturally occurring fungi) were applied with variations and compared to one control: a typical static biopile. An elevated-face compost turner was used to turn the soil in selected windrows for aeration. Statistically-based sampling was employed and quality control measures were enforced for sampling and analysis. The treatment options examined for the contaminated soil were: (1) white rot fungus and compost, (2) compost, poultry manure and turning, (3) compost, synthetic nitrogen-phosphorous-potassium fertilizer, and turning, (4) compost, the above synthetic fertilizer, and no turning, and (5) the above synthetic fertilizer, and no turning (static biopile). The compost and poultry manure process performed the best, remediating 35 tonnes of soil contaminated with 6000 mg/kg of <b>mineral</b> oil and <b>grease</b> (MOG) to the remediation criteria of 1000 mg/kg in 19 days and to less than 300 mg/kg in less than 56 days. The net rate of bioremediation was 100 mg/kg/day of MOG. The estimated cost of this process for commercial applications, excluding labour, excavation and site preparation, was $ 18 to $ 29 per tonne, depending {{on the cost of}} the poultry manure...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to examine the}} potential of spent lubricant as a medium to produce grease. Grease is a semi-solid colloidal dispersion of a thickener in a liquid lubricant matrix. Spent lubricant oils have significant potential as a base fluid and a substitute for <b>mineral</b> oil in <b>grease</b> formulations. The advantages of using products based on lubricant oils are their {{physical and chemical properties}} are close to that common grease production. Besides, this research allowing as optimizing the oil waste usage and reduce the environmental problem towards waste disposal. This work focuses on the preparation methods, optimization of thickener components, and antioxidant additive for producing spent lube oil based grease. In greases, Li-fatty acid thickener having C 12 to C 18 chain lengths and different metal to fatty acid ratios were synthesized. The percentages of thickener were varied at 5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 %. The research also focuses on varying the mixing temperature during the saponification of grease. Four sets of reaction temperature were 150 ◦C, 170 ◦C, 200 ◦C, and 230 ◦C. Four types of grease properties or characteristic to be tested in this research were grease oxidation stability, penetration, dynamic viscosity, and dropping point. Results indicate that Li-thickener composition, fatty acid types and base oil content and reaction temperature significantly affect grease hardness, dynamic viscosity, oxidation, and dropping point. It has been observed that the physical and chemical properties of grease are largely based on the thickener fibre micro-structure. -Author...|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} the fact that {{literature}} on toxicity of heavy metals in non-acidified freshwater systems is sparse, this project was initiated to conduct an environmental assessment of Lake Gibson. Chemistry of soils from adjacent areas and vineyards in the region provide a comparative background database. Water quality determinations were used to identify and highlight areas of environmental concern within the Lake Gibson watershed. A Shelby Corer was used to obtain 66 sediment cores from Lake Gibson. These were sectioned according to lithology and color to yield 298 samples. A suite of 122 soil samples was collected in the region and vicinity of Lake Gibson. All were tested for metals and some for Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH). Evaluation of the results leads to the following conclusions: 1. Metal concentrations ofAI, Cd, Cu, Cr, Pb, Ni, Fe and Zn in soils from the Niagara Region are well below background limits set by the Ministry of the Environment and Energy (MOEE) for provincial soils. 2. There is a spatial and depth difference for some of the metals within the various soils. The Cr, Ni and Pb contents of soils vary throughout the region (p<O. 05). In addition, Pb contents tend to be highest in surficial soil samples (p<O. 05), an observation consistent with deposition by airborne particulates. 3. The Ni contents of sediments from Lake Gibson fall below the LEL (Lower Effect Level) guideline specified by the MOEE for aquatic ecosystems. 4. All other metal contents exceed the LEL, and in some instances they also exceed the SEL (Severe Effect Level) guideline. In this instance acute toxicity testing of 11 the sediments is required to assess impact on the aquatic biota. 5. Specifically, effluents and discharges from outfalls, roadways, railways and industrial activities are all degrading the local ecosystem. 6. <b>Mineral</b> oil and <b>greases</b> are a major environmental concern in the sediments of Lake Gibson. Ofthe 240 samples tested for TPH, 200 samples exceed the MOEE Open Water Disposal Guideline of 1, 500 mg/kg. 7. Four areas within Lake Gibson are especially degraded with respect to TPH. One area is just downstream from the Old WeIland Canal divergence point and waterfall. Other areas of concern are located just south of Beaverdams Road and just west ofthe Ontario Hydro control pipes; south ofthe Village ofBeaverdams. The fourth area of environmental concern and TPH impact is located between Highway 406 and Merrittville Highway...|$|R
