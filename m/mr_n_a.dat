60|$|The {{first thing}} that strikes us on looking at the map, is, {{the small amount of}} {{overlapping}} of the several areas, and the isolation of many of the species; while the next most striking feature is {{the manner in which the}} Asiatic species almost surround a vast area in which no jays are found. The only species with large areas, are the European G. glandarius and the Asiatic G. Brandti. The former has three species overlapping it--in Algeria, in South-eastern and North-eastern Europe respectively. The Syrian jay (No. 4), is not known to occur anywhere with the black-headed jay (No. 3), and perhaps the two areas do not meet. The Persian jay (No. 5), is quite isolated. The Himalayan and Chinese jays (Nos. 7, 8, and 9) form a group which are isolated from the rest of the genus; while the Japanese jay (No. 11), is also completely isolated as regards the European jays to which it is nearly allied. These peculiarities of distribution are no doubt in part dependent on the habits of the jays, which live only in well-wooded districts, among deciduous trees, and are essentially non-migratory in their habits, though sometimes moving southwards in winter. This will explain their absence from the vast desert area of Central Asia, but it will not account for the gap between the North and South Chinese species, nor for the absence of jays from the wooded hills of Turkestan, where <b>Mr.</b> <b>N.</b> <b>A.</b> Severtzoff collected assiduously, obtaining 384 species of birds but no jay. These peculiarities, and the fact that jays are never very abundant anywhere, seem to indicate that the genus is now a decaying one, and that it has at no very distant epoch occupied a larger and more continuous area, such as that of the genus Parus at the present day.|$|E

40|$|Isolated {{congenital}} aneurysms of the iliac artery are unusual. This report describes such a case, {{revealed by}} acute rupture and successfully operated on. Case Report. <b>Mr.</b> <b>N.,</b> <b>a</b> thirty-three-year-old Caucasian, experienced, in a train from Brussel to Paris, a sudden acute abdominal pain followed by vomiting. On {{arrival at the}} emergency ward, he was pale, sweating, and had low blood pressure. The abdomen was distended on the left side, from the flanks to midline. Fluid and blood replacement were rapidly undertaken. An echogram suggested an aneurysm of the left iliac artery. Because such a diagnosis is unusual, a confirmation was requested by an arteriogram, which confirmed a large iliac pouch. The rest of the vascular system appeared normal (Fig. 1). Operative Procedure The patient {{was brought to the}} operating room. The retroperitoneal hematoma was volumi-nous and had completely displaced the descending colon toward the midline. The abdominal aorta was located and a clamp placed at ready. The main difficulty was to find the iliac artery beyond the aneurysm, in the depth of the hematoma. A retrograde dissection from the femoral artery was attempted, but bleeding resumed, obliging intraabdominal control. The iliac and hypogastric arteries were finally located in the hematoma and clamped. After all the hematoma was evacuated, the fusiform iliac artery appeared completely ruptured. There was no ather-oma, and the arterial walls were thin and fragile. After the aneurysm was resected, continuity was restored by a 10 -mm dacron prosthesis. Distally, the dacron was implanted on the exter...|$|E
