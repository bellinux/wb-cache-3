Rita tells him {{that there is no}} shoe, despite having found it over a <b>month</b> <b>ago.</b> She later admits that she found the shoe, but refuses to acknowledge that Dexter is involved. That night, she receives a call from Paul's prison and learns that he was killed in an inmate altercation.|$|E
5|$|The {{people in}} the coastal areas, {{most of which were}} already {{affected}} by the more catastrophic Pauline a <b>month</b> <b>ago,</b> were ready for Rick. All major ports along the coast were closed ahead of time in preparation, as well as airports in Huatulco and Puerto Escondido where power failures occurred because of Hurricane Rick. One hundred and thirty Red Cross workers, including twenty that were based in Mexico, who were in the area in the aftermath of Pauline, kept in the area to handle the second hurricane. Many people from Puerto Ángel, Huatulco, and Puerto Escondido (where National Operations Director Bernardino Heredia was overseeing recovery efforts) beach areas were evacuated. During the Puerto Ángel evacuation, helicopters landed carrying soldier and rifles, which one tourist likened to a third-world revolution. In Chiapas, officials watched for flooding along the rivers and upstream river valleys, where the rains from three previous systems caused the ground to saturate and in the state capital of Tuxtla Gutiérrez, families were evacuated due to rising rivers.|$|E

The National Rescue Council in Antananarivo reported 237 dead, 181 missing, 879 injured, and 304,000 homeless (among which 174,000 in Antalaha alone). More than 20,000 homes were destroyed, {{as well as}} 413 public buildings and 3,400 schools were damaged, including 1,400 completely destroyed ones.

25|$|Hampshire won the toss {{and chose}} to bat at a Southgate wicket which the final scores {{suggested}} {{to be not}} as batting-friendly as a <b>month</b> <b>ago,</b> when 13 wickets fell in the Championship match between Middlesex and Glamorgan. Three wickets from Chris Peploe set the visitors back to 189 for 7, but a 79-ball century from Shane Warne – {{just in time to}} get some Ashes form – lifted them to 355. The returning Irishman, Ed Joyce, made 54 for Middlesex, and Jamie Dalrymple made 62, but despite those innings – and 37 extras – Middlesex could only scamper 272.|$|E

25|$|On 22 August, the day Fourth Army retook Albert (a {{symbolic}} victory as it {{had been}} their forward base at the Somme two years earlier) Haig ordered his Army Commanders to pass down to all ranks the message that bold attacks were now needed, {{even to the point of}} divisions driving for distant objectives leaving their flanks uncovered: “risks which a <b>month</b> <b>ago</b> would have been criminal to incur, ought now to be incurred as a duty”. It has been suggested that this was aimed in part as a rebuke to Byng. The following day he sent out further guidance, quoting the relevant passage of Field Service Regulations, on how “advance guards” should feel for weak spots in the enemy defences.|$|E
25|$|In the singles tournament, Federer first played Colombian Alejandro Falla, {{who took}} him to five sets at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships. Federer took the first set with ease, but lost a few match points and his serve late in the second set, {{allowing}} Falla to make a comeback and level the match at one set all. Federer regained control over the match, however, and closed out the third set {{to advance to the}} second round. Federer then played Frenchman Julien Benneteau, who had also taken him to five sets at the 2012 Wimbledon Championships just over a <b>month</b> <b>ago.</b> Contrary to their previous matchup, Federer faced no challenge from Benneteau, and flew past him to a straight-sets win in less than an hour. Federer next played Uzbek Denis Istomin in the third round, and clinched a tight first set after a short rain delay. He then took command in the second set and defeated Istomin. In the quarterfinals, Federer faced American John Isner, and secured the first set after a break of Isner's serve allowed him to serve for the set. Federer then battled with Isner to reach a tiebreak in the second-set, which ended when a return of Isner's serve clipped the top of the net and dribbled over to win the match. In the semifinals, Federer faced Juan Martín del Potro for the sixth time this season. He found himself in a one-set deficit after del Potro broke {{him in the middle of}} the first set and held to win the set. Federer, however, fought back in the second set, and after losing two opportunities to serve for the set, won the tiebreak with an ace on his second set point. Federer and del Potro then began a third set which saw del Potro creating a one-game lead and Federer matching it in his service games. Federer managed to break del Potro after twenty games, but was unable to convert the break, and del Potro broke back to continue the pattern. Eventually, Federer engineered another break at seventeen games all, and held serve to win the match on his second match point. The match, which stretched over four hours and twenty-six minutes, broke the record for the longest best-of-three-sets system match in the Open Era, surpassing the 4 hours and 3 minutes in Rafael Nadal’s victory over Novak Djokovic in the 2009 Madrid Masters. Federer, who secured his first Olympic medal and Switzerland's first medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics with his semifinal win, played Briton Andy Murray in the final. Federer was unable to find a way to control the match, and saw his serve broken five times en route to a loss in straight sets, which resulted in earning him a silver medal. Federer’s finals finish, along with World No. 2 Novak Djokovic's semifinals finish, guaranteed that he would retain his World No. 1 ranking.|$|E

In March 2004, Morissette amended a lyric at the fifteenth annual GLAAD Media Awards: [...] "It's meeting {{the man of}} my dreams /And then meeting his beautiful husband". She commented to USA Today that her support about same-sex unions [...] "goes a step further than clever lyrics." [...] She remarked that [...] " [...] fantasy would now be to marry some of [...] gay couple friends." [...] Later in June 2004, she said to VH1: [...] "I don't have any gay-couple friends who are formally engaged, but I would be honored to support the gay community in that way ... I did it {{as a sort of}} spontaneous thing at a radio station about a <b>month</b> <b>ago</b> with a couple, and my heart was so with them." [...] Morissette recorded an acoustic version of the song with the changed lyric for her iTunes Originals release, in 2004. Another acoustic version was recorded for the album Jagged Little Pill Acoustic, as well for the compilation album Cities 97 Sampler, Volume 16 (2004).

Nicholas [...] "Nick" [...] Yoon, Noah's younger half brother, steals some of Noah's ashes for her to use, and soon joins her in mourning.

Nick takes her to the hospital, where she recovers.

After the date, Bethany (Anna Camp) expresses interest in seeing Don again, but rejects his sexual advances. On Thanksgiving Day, Don spends time with a prostitute, and Betty has problems fitting in with the family of her new husband Henry (Christopher Stanley). At Thanksgiving dinner with his family, Betty's daughter Sally (Kiernan Shipka) complains about the food. The childish action blows up into a scene when Betty yells at Sally, treats her brusquely, and causes problems by forcing food into Sally's [...] mouth. Henry's mother later privately expresses displeasure with her son's new wife, observing that her children are clearly scared of her. However, in bed, Henry and Betty get along. The next day, Don picks up his two oldest children for an overnight visit, and Don is disappointed he can't see baby Gene, whom Betty sent to Carla's. Betty curtly tells Don to have the kids back by 9. When he returns the next evening, the house is empty and he has to wait for Betty and Henry to come back.

500|$|Some campaigning by party {{workers of}} the True Finns caused {{controversy}} over {{the nature of their}} actions. Most complaints emanated from the Helsinki region. Jussi Saramo of the Left Alliance in the Uusimaa electoral district said of their actions that [...] " [...] I have been involved in politics for 12 years and I have never seen such excesses." [...] This followed an event in Korso in Vantaa where he parked his campaign trailer in a spot the True Finns said was reserved for party chairman Timo Soini. True Finns' candidate Mika Niikko however said those involved in the spat were no longer working for his campaign and he apologised to Saramo despite maintaining his stance that the placement of the trailer was a deliberate provocation: [...] "I do not approve of being provoked when someone tries to provoke;" [...] he also added that the volunteers working for the True Finns campaign come [...] "from here and there" [...] and {{it was not possible to}} verify everyone beforehand. He further added a claim that True Finns supporters have also been targets of aggressive behaviour. [...] "A <b>month</b> <b>ago</b> we were not verbally abused, but now you can hear all kinds of language." [...] The Social Democrats' foreign-born candidate Ranbir Sodhi was allegedly confronted by True Finns supporters in the Myyrmäki district of Vantaa who were said to have told him to go back [...] "to his own country" [...] where he could become a politician. A week after the confrontations, however, he said that [...] "the same guys came to Tikkurila to apologise." [...] The National Coalition Party MP Raija Vahasalo also complained that during a campaign event in Kirkkonummi the True Finns handed out leaflets at the same time that claimed she favoured Swedish-speaking residents in allocating local school funding. The action was due to two local members of the True Finns who are not running to become MPs. The chairman of Kirkkonummi True Finns and a candidate in the election Pekka Sinisalo said he confiscated the remainder of the leaflets. [...] "I do not approve of attacking Vahasalo’s person. Election fever sometimes leads to these kinds of excesses." [...] This was controversial as negative campaigning is unusual in Finnish elections. In response to such actions the party secretaries of the largest political parties held a meeting to discuss certain ground rules for the rest of the campaign, however the True Finns' Ossi Sandvik could not make it.|$|E
