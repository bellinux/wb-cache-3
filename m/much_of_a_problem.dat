5|$|Furious, already {{partially}} converted {{during the}} war, began her reconstruction in 1921, before the Treaty came into effect. In {{an attempt to}} minimize air turbulence, she was given no superstructure or island. This was not entirely satisfactory, and a small island was added in 1939. Another problem was that she lacked a standard funnel; instead, her boiler uptakes ran {{along the sides of}} the ship and exhausted out of gratings on the rear of the flight deck, or at the sides of the ship if landing operations were in progress. The long ducts reduced her aircraft capacity, and the exhaust gases were as <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for landing aircraft as the turbulence would have been. Her half-sisters, Courageous and Glorious, began their conversions to aircraft carriers as Furious neared completion. They drew upon the experience gained by the Royal Navy since Furious had been designed and incorporated an island with a funnel, increasing their aircraft capacity by one-third and making it safer to land.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to the {{railroad}} line returning to service included {{that it would}} be as <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> to downtown traffic as the container trucks and that the noise would be a disturbance to nearby residents. As with before, however, trains are occasional and reserved for specialty loads, such as oversized loads and hazardous materials, which will be banned from the tunnel. It was also stated that the trains, which will be able to go up to 30mph on the newly renovated line versus the old limit of 5mph, will be able to cross Biscayne Boulevard in 90 seconds. The current plan is for the line to be strictly for intermodal services, with the project including a rail yard and station at the port, however, in the future a passenger station may be added.|$|E
5|$|Unanticipated deaths among recent condor populations {{occurred}} due {{to contact}} with golden eagles, lead poisoning, {{and other factors}} such as power line collisions. Since 1994, captive-bred California condors {{have been trained to}} avoid power lines and people. Since the implementation of this aversion conditioning program, the number of condor deaths due to power lines has greatly decreased. Lead poisoning due to fragmented lead bullets in large game waste is a particularly big problem for condors due to their extremely strong digestive juices; lead waste is not as <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for other avian scavengers such as the turkey vulture and common raven. This problem has been addressed in California by the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, a bill that went into effect July 1, 2008 that requires that hunters use non-lead bullets when hunting in the condor's range. Blood lead levels in golden eagles as well as turkey vultures has declined with the implementation of the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, demonstrating that the legislation has helped reduce other species' lead exposures aside from the California condor. There is no comparable anti-lead-bullet legislation in the other states in which the condor currently resides.|$|E

Horses and mules were important methods of transportation that could be endangered if they came into close contact with gas.

This caused many researchers to develop masks that could be used on animals such as dogs, horses, mules, and even carrier pigeons.|$|E
25|$|The lone {{ammonium}} molecule problem {{provides a}} problem for Jackson's solution to epiphenomenal ectoplasm. It was proposed by Jaegwon Kim in 1993 when he stated that according to Jackson's idea of supervenience, a possible world W was identical to the actual world, except it possessed an extra ammonium molecule on one of Saturn's rings. This may not seem to provide <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> but because Jackson's solution refers only to minimal physical duplicates, this allows for the mental properties of W to be vastly different from in the actual world. If such a difference would cause mental differences on Earth, {{it would not be}} consistent with our understanding of physicalism.|$|E
25|$|This {{was not too}} <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> {{while the}} station {{was at the end}} of the line, but on 30 May 1846 the South Devon Railway (SDR) opened a line westwards towards Plymouth. A {{carriage}} shed was built for the SDR at the south end of the B platform but the goods sheds and locomotive sheds for both companies were to the west, between the station and the River Exe. The SDR was designed to be worked by atmospheric power and an engine house was built on the banks of the river near the locomotive shed. This was only used for its original purpose for about a year but was not demolished until many years later.|$|E

25|$|Spatially encoded {{frequency}} domain OCT (SEFD-OCT, spectral domain or Fourier domain OCT) extracts spectral information by distributing different optical frequencies onto a detector stripe (line-array CCD or CMOS) via a dispersive element (see Fig. 4). Thereby the information {{of the full}} depth scan can be acquired within a single exposure. However, the large signal to noise advantage of FD-OCT is reduced due to the lower dynamic range of stripe detectors with respect to single photosensitive diodes, resulting in an SNR (signal to noise ratio) advantage of ~10 dB at much higher speeds. This is not <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> when working at 1300nm, however, since dynamic range is not a serious problem at this wavelength range.|$|E
25|$|On July 3, 2000, KNTV {{terminated}} its ABC affiliation after 40 {{years with}} the network; it then temporarily carried programming from The WB Television Network in a part-time simulcast with then co-owned KBWB-TV (channel 20, now KOFY-TV), which was the full-time WB affiliate for the San Francisco Bay Area. The move cost the Monterey Bay area an over-the-air ABC affiliate. In order {{to compensate for the}} loss, KGO-TV was then added on cable providers in that market, with certain syndicated programs carried by the station replaced due to syndication exclusivity rules. This did not pose as <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> as it may seem due to the very high penetration of cable and satellite in the Monterey Bay area. ABC would not return over-the-air to the area until KSBW began carrying ABC programming on the station's second digital subchannel on April 18, 2011.|$|E
25|$|An {{obvious way}} to {{generate}} permutations of n is to generate {{values for the}} Lehmer code (possibly using the factorial number system representation of integers up to n!), and convert those into the corresponding permutations. However, the latter step, while straightforward, is hard to implement efficiently, because it requires n operations each of selection from a sequence and deletion from it, at an arbitrary position; of the obvious representations of the sequence as an array or a linked list, both require (for different reasons) about n2/4 operations to perform the conversion. With n likely to be rather small (especially if generation of all permutations is needed) that is not too <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> {{but it turns out}} that both for random and for systematic generation there are simple alternatives that do considerably better. For this reason it does not seem useful, although certainly possible, to employ a special data structure that would allow performing the conversion from Lehmer code to permutation in O(n log n) time.|$|E

500|$|Typical of most early jets, the Thunderjet's takeoff {{performance}} left {{much to be}} desired. In hot Korean summers with a full combat load, {{the aircraft}} routinely required 10,000ft (3,000m) of runway for takeoff even {{with the help of}} RATO bottles (two or four of these were carried, each producing 1,000lbf (4.4kN) of thrust for 14 seconds). All but the lead aircraft had their visibility obscured by the thick smoke from the rockets. Early F-84s had to be pulled off the ground at 160mph (140kn, 260km/h) with the control stick held all the way back. Landings were made at a similar speed, for comparison the North American P-51 Mustang landed at approximately 120mph (100kn, 190km/h).

500|$|Reckless's {{entry into}} the United States was not without its challenges. The Customs Bureau was not <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> but the United States Department of Agriculture insisted a medical check and lab tests be {{completed}} before she disembarked from the ship once it reached San Francisco, which would make her late for the Marine banquet where {{she was to be}} the guest of honor. The Marines contacted Agriculture Department officials in Washington, D.C. who agreed to allow her off the ship after her blood was drawn for lab tests, with the understanding that if she had glanders or dourine, she would be destroyed or sent back to Japan. Many of the Marines who actually knew her were incensed at what they considered an affront to her honor when they learned that dourine was an equine sexually transmitted disease. The night before she arrived, she once again ate her blanket, but a new one with ribbons and insignia was made just in time for her disembarkation. She was led off the ship by Lieutenant Pedersen and set foot on American soil in San Francisco on November 10, 1954, coincidentally the birthday of the [...] Marine Corps. For the Marine Corps Birthday Ball held that day, she rode an elevator, and then ate both cake and the flower decorations.|$|E

50|$|On new buildings, a solid fire {{retardant}} barrier over the rafters {{can make the}} thatch sacrificial in case of fire.

2500|$|Behaviors of {{hatchlings}} {{differ from}} that of adults. [...] After a hatchling emerges from the sand, it immediately goes out to sea. Hatchlings use {{the light of the}} night sky to find their way into the ocean. However, in many areas with coastal development, the hatchlings become confused from false light and sometimes move in the wrong direction to their deaths; this is not as <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for Galápagos green turtles due to lack of development in the islands. Importantly, the hatchlings emerge at night to be protected from predators. They quickly move out to sea and swim for up to 24 hours to be far removed from shore and the predators in that area. They spend many years in the open ocean before entering the coastal habitat for the maturation period as juveniles. [...] This period of maturation lasts from 10 to 20 years; black sea turtles usually spend time along the coasts of the Baja California peninsula and the connecting bays, lagoons, and channels that provide excellent forage and protection.|$|E
2500|$|The tanegashima {{seems to}} have been based on snap matchlocks that were {{produced}} in Portuguese Malacca, at the armory of Malacca (a colony of Portugal since 1511). The name tanegashima came from the Japanese island (Tanegashima) where a Chinese junk with Portuguese adventurers on board was driven to anchor by a storm in 1543. The lord of the Japanese island, Tanegashima Tokitaka (1528–1579), purchased two matchlock muskets from the Portuguese and put a swordsmith to work copying the matchlock barrel and firing mechanism. The smith (Yaita) did not have <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with most of the gun but [...] "drilling the barrel helically so that the screw (bisen bolt) could be tightly inserted" [...] was a major problem as this [...] "technique did apparently not exist in Japan until this time."

50|$|Lens sag is <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> that {{sometimes}} afflicts very large refracting telescopes. It {{is the equivalent}} of mirror sag in reflecting telescopes.

Carter steadfastly refused to participate with Anderson included, and Reagan refused to debate without him. It took months of negotiations for the League of Women Voters to finally put it together. It was held on September 21, 1980 in the Baltimore Convention Center. Reagan said of Carter's refusal to debate: [...] "He [...] knows that he couldn't win a debate even if it were held in the Rose Garden before an audience of Administration officials with the questions being asked by Jody Powell." [...] The League of Women Voters promised the Reagan campaign that the debate stage would feature an empty chair to represent the missing president. Carter was very upset about the planned chair stunt, and at the last minute convinced the League to take it out. The debate was moderated by Bill Moyers. Anderson, who many thought would handily dispatch the former Governor, managed only a draw, according to many in the media at that time. The Illinois congressman, who had been as high as 20% in some polls, and {{at the time of the}} debate was over 10%, dropped to about 5% soon after. Anderson failed to substantively engage Reagan, instead he started off by criticizing Carter: [...] "Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I.
