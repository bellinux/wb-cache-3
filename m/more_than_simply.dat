5|$|The Wreck {{experienced}} a major transition of ownership after the Centennial Celebration. Since Reck Club had financially maintained {{the vehicle for}} so long and Reck Club fell under the Dean of Students rather than the Athletic Association, the vehicle was sold from the Athletic Association to the Institute for zero dollars in 1987. The transaction further solidified Reck Club's responsibilities over the car but also made the car <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> a football mascot. The Old Ford was officially an Institute icon.|$|E
5|$|During the Han Dynasty, silk became {{progressively}} more valuable {{in its own}} right, and became <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> a material. It was used to pay government officials and compensate citizens who were particularly worthy. By the same token that one would sometimes estimate the price of products according to a certain weight of gold, {{the length of the}} silk cloth became a monetary standard in China (in addition to bronze coins). The wealth that silk brought to China stirred envy in neighboring peoples. Beginning in the 2nd century BCE, the Xiongnu regularly pillaged the provinces of the Han Chinese for around 250 years. Silk was a common offering by the emperor to these tribes in exchange for peace.|$|E

5|$|The Blues and the Greens {{were now}} <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> sports teams. They gained {{influence}} in military, political, and theological matters, although {{the hypothesis that}} the Greens tended towards Monophysitism and the Blues represented Orthodoxy is disputed. It is now widely believed that neither of the factions had any consistent religious bias or allegiance, {{in spite of the fact}} that they operated in an environment fraught with religious controversy. According to some scholars, the Blue-Green rivalry contributed to the conditions that underlay the rise of Islam, while factional enmities were exploited by the Sassanid Empire in its conflicts with the Byzantines during the century preceding Islam's advent.|$|E
5|$|The Audubon Naturalist Society also {{actively}} opposed such spraying programs, and recruited Carson to {{help make}} public the government's exact spraying practices and the related research. Carson began the four-year project of what would become Silent Spring by gathering examples of environmental damage attributed to DDT. She also attempted to enlist others to join the cause: essayist E. B. White, {{and a number of}} journalists and scientists. By 1958, Carson had arranged a book deal, with plans to co-write with Newsweek science journalist Edwin Diamond. However, when The New Yorker commissioned a long and well-paid article on the topic from Carson, she began considering writing <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> the introduction and conclusion as planned; soon it was a solo project. (Diamond would later write one of the harshest critiques of Silent Spring).|$|E

25|$|Sexual {{orientation}} is <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> a 'status' {{that an individual}} possesses; it is an immutable personal characteristic that forms part of an individual's core identity.

25|$|Although power-law {{relations}} are attractive for many theoretical reasons, demonstrating that data does indeed follow a power-law relation requires <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> fitting a particular {{model to the}} data.

50|$|Although {{viridian}} is a less-used color name in English, {{it is used}} in {{a number}} of cultural references, probably because it is derived from viridis, the Latin word for green, so using the word viridian sounds <b>more</b> elegant <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> referring to the Old English word green.|$|R
50|$|There was a {{definite}} plot line {{which gave the}} film <b>more</b> depth <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> a series of interviews. The viewer was granted a look {{into the life of}} an African American artist which was different from that of a white famous musician of the same time.|$|R

25|$|The {{question}} of whether Beowulf was passed down through oral tradition prior to its present manuscript form {{has been the subject}} of much debate, and involves <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> the issue of its composition.

50|$|Coloring {{books are}} widely used in {{schooling}} for young children for various reasons.

25|$|Shostakovich {{confined}} himself {{largely to}} reorchestrating the opera, and was more {{respectful of the}} composer's unique melodic and harmonic style. However, Shostakovich greatly increased {{the contributions of the}} woodwind and especially brass instruments to the score, a significant departure from the practice of Mussorgsky, who exercised great restraint in his instrumentation, preferring to utilize the individual qualities of these instruments for specific purposes. Shostakovich also aimed for a greater symphonic development, wanting the orchestra to do <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> accompany the singers.|$|E

Proper job enrichment, therefore, involves <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> giving the workers extra tasks to perform. It means expanding the level of knowledge and skills needed to perform the job.|$|E
