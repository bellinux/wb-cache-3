5|$|Microsoft Windows {{keeps the}} system {{real-time}} clock in local time. This causes several problems, including compatibility when <b>multi</b> booting with operating systems {{that set the}} clock to UTC, and double-adjusting the clock when <b>multi</b> booting different Windows versions, such as with a rescue boot disk. This approach is a problem even in Windows-only systems: there is no support for per-user timezone settings, only a single system-wide setting. In 2008 Microsoft hinted that future versions of Windows will partially support a Windows registry entry RealTimeIsUniversal that had been introduced many years earlier, when Windows NT supported RISC machines with UTC clocks, but had not been maintained. Since then at least two fixes related to this feature have been published by Microsoft.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} years of the 1940s saw a growth in the cinema of the Dutch East Indies, with over forty {{domestic}} productions released. Following the Japanese occupation in February 1942, production slowed greatly and nearly all film studios were closed. The last studio, the ethnic Chinese-owned <b>Multi</b> Film, was confiscated by the Japanese to establish the film production company Nippon Eigasha in Jakarta, the colony's capital. This included <b>Multi</b> Film's equipment, with which Nippon Eigasha produced one feature film– Rd Ariffien's Berdjoang (Struggle; 1943)– six short films, and several newsreels.
