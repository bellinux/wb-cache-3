50|$|Usenet was {{the primary}} serial medium {{included}} in the original definition of the Internet. It features the <b>moderated</b> <b>newsgroup</b> which allowed all posting in a newsgroup {{to be under the}} control of an individual or small group. Most such newsgroups were simply moderated discussion forums, however, in late 1983, mod.ber, was created, named after and managed by Brian E. Redman; he, and a few associates regularly posted summaries of interesting postings and threads taking place elsewhere on the net. Another <b>moderated</b> <b>newsgroup,</b> rec.humor.funny (rec.humor.funny via Google Groups), started on August 7, 1987. As of 2016, the group still exists but is inactive, as no joke has been posted for two years.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>moderated</b> <b>newsgroup</b> has {{one or more}} {{individuals}} who must approve posts before they are published. A separate address is used to submit posts and the moderators then propagate those they approve of. The first moderated newsgroups appeared in 1984 under mod.* according to RFC 2235, [...] "Hobbes' Internet Timeline".|$|E
5000|$|B2.10 {{contained}} limited {{support for}} <b>moderated</b> <b>newsgroups,</b> with posters needing to manually mail in submissions to an intermediate party who would post articles on their behalf. Moderated groups {{needed to be}} prefixed with [...] "mod." [...] In 1986, version B2.11 allowed <b>moderated</b> <b>newsgroups</b> to appear in any hierarchy, and it transparently mailed out moderated group submissions using the normal posting software.|$|R
2500|$|Historically, a mod.* {{hierarchy}} {{existed before}} Usenet reorganization. Now, <b>moderated</b> <b>newsgroups</b> may appear in any hierarchy, typically with [...]moderated {{added to the}} group name.|$|R
25|$|Creation of <b>moderated</b> <b>newsgroups</b> often {{becomes a}} hot subject of controversy, raising issues {{regarding}} censorship {{and the desire}} of a subset of users to form an intentional community.|$|R
50|$|In early 1997 a moderated {{version of}} alt.sex.stories was created {{due to an}} {{increasing}} number of posts by “various pay services, scam artists, and bots”. This <b>moderated</b> <b>newsgroup</b> (ASSM) has always operated by cross-posting all approved stories to alt.sex.stories, and is not simply a filtered version of the unmoderated group, rather, all stories posted to ASSM were specifically submitted there.|$|E
5000|$|Experimental Machinist Douglas Goncz {{connected}} three ultracapacitor packs on {{an electric}} hub equipped recumbent bicycle in series/parallel with a 4PDT toggle switch in 2007 {{and described the}} resulting MObile Experimental Physics Educational Demonstrator (MOEPED) and its 19 kJ [...] "electric flywheel" [...] in a newsgroup posting to the <b>moderated</b> <b>newsgroup</b> sci.physics.research dated 11/9 of that year titled [...] "MOEPED Update" [...] and in other newsgroup threads under the keyword [...] "MOEPED". In parallel, the packs were a regenerative brake; in series, they were a boost source. The vehicle remained in use so equipped until 2010. It was surplus disposed in 2013.|$|E
5000|$|The {{receiving}} server {{examines the}} incoming articles. A message is normally discarded if the Message-ID is duplicated by an article already received (i.e., another server sent {{it in the}} meantime), the Date or Expires lines indicate that the article is too old, the header syntax appears to be invalid, the Approved header is missing for a <b>moderated</b> <b>newsgroup,</b> or additional local rules disallow it. Most servers also maintain a list of active newsgroups. If the Newsgroups header of a new article does not match the active list, it may be discarded or placed in a special [...] "junk" [...] newsgroup. Once the article is stored, the server attempts to retransmit it to any servers in its own newsfeed list.|$|E
5000|$|Over time, the {{accumulated}} FAQs across all USENET news groups sparked {{the creation of}} the [...] "*.answers" [...] <b>moderated</b> <b>newsgroups</b> such as comp.answers, misc.answers and sci.answers for crossposting and collecting FAQ across respective comp.*, misc.*, sci.* newsgroups.|$|R
5000|$|These hierarchies, known {{collectively as}} the [...] "Big Seven", were open and free {{for anyone to}} {{participate}} in (except for the <b>moderated</b> <b>newsgroups),</b> though they were subject to a few general rules governing their naming and distribution.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} seven hierarchies were comp.*, misc.*, news.*, rec.*, sci.*, soc.*, and talk.*. They {{were open}} and free {{for anyone to}} participate in (except for the <b>moderated</b> <b>newsgroups),</b> though they were subject to a few general rules governing their naming and distribution.|$|R
5000|$|Usenet {{began with}} only a few {{messages}} per day, but volume rapidly grew to become a problem. Horton added <b>moderated</b> <b>newsgroups,</b> distinguished with names beginning with [...] "mod" [...] or containing [...] "announce", and moderated the first such newsgroup: news.announce.important. Only the moderator could post messages, all other messages were automatically sent to the moderator for approval. Eventually the B News software was enhanced to permit any newsgroup with any name to be moderated.|$|R
50|$|The RISKS Digest is {{published}} on a frequent but irregular schedule through the <b>moderated</b> Usenet <b>newsgroup</b> comp.risks, which exists solely {{to carry the}} Digest.|$|R
5000|$|After it {{had been}} sold and resold during {{the onset of the}} dot-com bubble, UUNET {{acquired}} the nickname SpewSpewNET. This nickname was given because UUNET had become a home for many distributors of spam, including distributors of both Newsgroup spam and E-mail spam. UUNET also became known for providing bulletproof hosting to many web pages whose chief form of advertisement was spam. Because UUNET started with a loan from Usenix and controlled the e-mail addresses for moderated Usenet groups, it was hard to block email traffic to or from Usenet. In 1997, UUNET had lost so much credit that on 1 August, after finding alternate routes for <b>moderated</b> <b>newsgroups,</b> a Usenet death penalty (UDP) was issued against UUNET. A week later, the UDP was lifted. In 1998 UUNET threatened legal action for hosting a GIF image with [...] "SPAMUNET" [...] on it.|$|R
5000|$|... rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.moderated is a <b>moderated</b> Usenet <b>newsgroup</b> {{that focuses}} on the science fiction {{television}} series Babylon 5 and the works of writer J. Michael Straczynski. It was spun off from its un-moderated version, rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5, in 1996. The newsgroup counts Straczynski as a frequent contributor, and was among the first internet-based fora where fans interacted directly with a 'showrunner'.|$|R
40|$|A unique <b>moderated</b> USENET <b>newsgroup,</b> sci. med. aids, {{was created}} on June 13, 1987 to host an {{electronic}} discussion of medical, social, ethical {{and political issues}} associated with AIDS. After 7 months of operation, sci. med. aids claims a worldwide readership of over 11, 000 people. Unlike any other <b>moderated</b> USENET <b>newsgroup,</b> six physically-separated experts control sci. med. aids editorial policy through a democratic process. Moderation team members propose changes, debate, and vote through electronic mail. Within the team, members take on distinct roles. A chief moderator handles most editorial tasks. Expert technical contributors may post technical articles directly, bypassing the overhead of moderation. One member posts a Monthly AIDS Summary to sci. med. aids and related USENET newsgroups. This paper briefly reviews normal USENET moderation, presents the formation and current structure of the sci. med. aids team, analyzes problems encountered, and discusses the advantages and disadvanta [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Currently {{the day-to-day}} {{operations}} and general direction of ASSM is overseen by the Alt.Sex.Stories Text Repository (ASSTR), which coordinates a group of volunteers to <b>moderate</b> the <b>newsgroup</b> using a web-based voting system. ASSTR also hosts an archive of the newsgroup, and a mirror of the Nifty Erotic Stories Archive (gay). ASSM {{is one of the}} few remaining active groups in the alt.sex.* hierarchy.|$|R
5000|$|Notes and Queries {{was first}} {{published}} in 1849 as a weekly periodical edited by W.J. Thoms. It was founded as an academic correspondence magazine, in which scholars and interested amateurs could exchange knowledge on folklore, literature and history. The format consisted of [...] "Notes" [...] (miscellaneous findings of correspondents that they and the editors considered of interest to the readership), and [...] "Queries" [...] (and responses to queries), which formed the bulk of the publication. The magazine has been likened to a nineteenth century version of a <b>moderated</b> Internet <b>newsgroup.</b>|$|R
