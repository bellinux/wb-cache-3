5|$|The economy {{continued}} in muted form. The three <b>main</b> <b>establishment</b> families on the island, the Moodys, the Sealys, and Kempners, had essentially unrivalled {{control of the}} island. The Splash Day celebrations restarted, drawing tourists to the coast. Many hotels, banks, and some insurance companies remained as did the medical and nursing schools, {{as well as the}} hospitals. Efforts at historical preservation (notably including those of George P. Mitchell) gradually helped to re-establish the island's tourism industry, though in a very different form from the past. Nonbinding referenda were put forward in the 1980s regarding legalization of casinos in the city but were defeated by the voters each time, demonstrating the changes in the city since the bygone era. However informal polls in 2008 and 2010 indicate this sentiment may be changing. Indeed gambling aboard cruise ships leaving from Galveston is now commonplace.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the funds}} of the Dean Colet Foundation had {{increased}} {{to such an extent that}} the Trustees decided to build a school for girls, and in 1904, St Paul's Girls' School was opened in Brook Green, Hammersmith, just around the corner from the then site of the boys' school in Hammersmith Road. Unlike the boys', the girls' school remains in its original position, although it has expanded and constructed new buildings and facilities alongside the old. In 1881, a boys' preparatory school was founded which later became Colet Court, now St Paul's Juniors. St Paul's Juniors is now on the same site as the main school and most of its pupils are expected to pass into St Paul's School when they reach the age of 13.

60|$|In the {{meantime}} Mr. Astor, finding his overtures rejected, proceeded fearlessly to execute his enterprise in {{face of the}} whole power of the Northwest Company. His <b>main</b> <b>establishment</b> once planted {{at the mouth of}} the Columbia, he looked with confidence to ultimate success. Being able to reinforce and supply it amply by sea, he would push his interior posts in every direction up the rivers and along the coast; supplying the natives at a lower rate, and thus gradually obliging the Northwest Company to give up the competition, relinquish New Caledonia, and retire to the other side of the mountains. He would then have possession of the trade, not merely of the Columbia and its tributaries, but of the regions farther north, quite to the Russian possessions. Such was a part of his brilliant and comprehensive plan.|$|E
60|$|It {{was then}} that the idea {{presented}} itself to the mind of Mr. Astor, of grasping with his individual hand this great enterprise, which for years had been dubiously yet desirously contemplated by powerful associations and maternal governments. For some time he revolved the idea in his mind, gradually extending and maturing his plans as his means of executing them augmented. The main feature of his scheme was to establish a line of trading posts along the Missouri and the Columbia, {{to the mouth of}} the latter, where was to be founded the chief trading house or mart. Inferior posts would be established in the interior, and on all the tributary streams of the Columbia, to trade with the Indians; these posts would draw their supplies from the <b>main</b> <b>establishment,</b> and bring to it the peltries they collected. Coasting craft would be built and fitted out, also {{at the mouth of the}} Columbia, to trade, at favorable seasons, all along the northwest coast, and return, with the proceeds of their voyages, to this place of deposit. Thus all the Indian trade, both of the interior and the coast, would converge to this point, and thence derive its sustenance.|$|E
60|$|A {{ship was}} to be sent {{annually}} from New York to this <b>main</b> <b>establishment</b> with reinforcements and supplies, and with merchandise suited to the trade. It would take on board the furs collected during the preceding year, carry them to Canton, invest the proceeds in the rich merchandise of China, and return thus freighted to New York. As, in extending the American trade along the coast to the northward, it might {{be brought into the}} vicinity of the Russian Fur Company, and produce a hostile rivalry, {{it was part of the}} plan of Mr. Astor to conciliate the good-will of that company by the most amicable and beneficial arrangements. The Russian establishment was chiefly dependent for its supplies upon transient trading vessels from the United States. These vessels, however, were often of more harm than advantage. Being owned by private adventurers, or casual voyagers, who cared only for present profit, and had no interest in the permanent prosperity of the trade, they were reckless in their dealings with the natives, and made no scruple of supplying them with fire-arms. In this way several fierce tribes in the vicinity of the Russian posts, or within the range of their trading excursions, were furnished with deadly means of warfare, and rendered troublesome and dangerous neighbors.|$|E

40|$|Background: Amongst {{contemporary}} companies, {{knowledge is}} considered as {{an ever more}} important factor of production and hence a competitive device. Demands on well-developed processes of knowledge management are particularly high in project based companies. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to investigate whether there is need to improve knowledge transfer between projects within the project based business of the case company, ABB Power Systems AB. If the investigation shows that such needs exist, {{the aim of the}} thesis is also to investigate the nature of these needs as well as to provide the company with suggestions on areas of improvement. Delimitations: The thesis does not consider possible impacts of knowledge transfer within a group, or any one individual’s particular function within the organisation, on processes of knowledge transfer between projects. Realisation: The investigation was carried out during a period of four weeks spent at the company’s <b>main</b> <b>establishment</b> in Ludvika, Sweden. It is based on 16 interviews with employees in two projects of different types, as well as observations on site. Results: It is important for the company to identify existing types of knowledge within its business as well as to decide which one / ones to focus in its efforts to enhance the processes of knowledge transfer. Furthermore, the company is encouraged to decide upon one particular strategy on how to manage these matters. To identify a firmly established division of responsibility and to promote continuity in transfer processes is also important to the company. We believe that the presented reasoning can be useful not only to the case company but to other project based companies...|$|E
40|$|In September 2014 the ECJ {{issued its}} {{decision}} in C- 7 / 13 the Skandia case. The case con- cerned service transactions made between a <b>main</b> <b>establishment</b> {{in a third}} country and its Swedish branch. The branch {{was a member of}} a VAT group in Sweden. The ECJ estab- lished that the membership resulted in that the VAT group was considered as one taxable person which meant that the services was considered provided to the group itself and not the separate member. Therefore the transactions were deemed taxable. The purpose of this thesis is to analyse the ECJ’s assessment and judgment of the Skandia case, and how the decision affect art. 11 of the VAT Directive about VAT groups. The art. 11 of the VAT Directive provides a possibility for Member States of the EU to in- troduce rules that makes it possible for more than one person, if they meet certain criteria, to qualify as a single taxable person. In Sweden, these rules are implemented in chapter 6 a of the Swedish VAT Law. The rules on VAT groups have been further developed and in- terpreted by case law from the ECJ. The thesis shows that the Skandia case confirms some of the principles from previous case law, and develops new principles for the application of art. 11 of the VAT Directive. We draw the conclusion that the development of the law in relation to the ECJ's decision in the Skandia case, indicates that art. 11 of the VAT Directive should be assessed independently and not be influenced by other articles of the VAT Directive. We also believe that the Skandia case suggest that the territorial limitation of art. 11 means that a person must be physically established in a Member State to be able to be a member of a VAT group in that Member State. Finally, we draw the conclusion that the Skandia case indicates that the ECJ has taken inspiration from the international co-operation organ OECD. Such development is interesting because a correlation between these two organs would lead to a greater pre- dictability and legal certainty on an international level. ...|$|E
