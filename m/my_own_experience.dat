25|$|I didn't write any {{songs in}} Henderson, {{but it was}} there I {{realized}} that experiences I had had, things I had seen and heard could be set down {{in a kind of}} music characteristic of my race.

I’ll take a little of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> of having some heavy party time with certain friends, and then I’ll hear some other stories about addicts or other intense relationships. I’ll put them into the mixing pot and make up these characters to explore different possibilities and emotional landscapes.|$|E

It may seem hard to believe such a thing could happen and not be noticed, but from <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> I {{understand}} it. The men in the turret often stopped their ears, and perhaps their eyes, {{at the moment of}} firing, and then instantly worked the run-in levers, and did not notice how much the guns had recoiled. This no doubt occurred. Both guns were at once reloaded, and the rammer's indicator, working by machinery, set fast and failed to show how far the new charge had gone." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{conceived}} it in 2001 and NBC ordered 13 episodes {{the following}} year; the show's original pilot used a single-camera setup but NBC executives {{felt it would}} have more appeal as a multiple-camera setup, so it was re-shot. Appel noted of the show: [...] "There's a sense sometimes in Hollywood that writers and producers who come from animated shows maybe have something to prove to justify their credibility as live-action show-runners or writers. <b>My</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> has been fortunate. I haven't felt that. But I know it exists." [...] The show was not acclaimed: Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said it was [...] "too cartoonish to work." [...] Appel then wrote {{and worked as a}} co-executive producer on The Bernie Mac Show and Kitchen Confidential, and appeared as Josh in the 2004 film I ♥ Huckabees.|$|E
500|$|According to the New Straits Times, Hickling {{later wrote}} in 1989, [...] "I {{could not imagine}} then that the time would come when the power of detention, {{carefully}} and deliberately interlocked with Article 149 of the Constitution, would be used against political opponents, welfare workers and others dedicated to nonviolent, peaceful activities." [...] However, he commented {{that it was not}} for him to say if the Internal Security Act should be scrapped. [...] "As a lawyer, I'm all for its review but on whether it should be scrapped, I don't know. You've got a multi-racial society [...] in which emotions can run high very quickly." [...] Interviewed on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's radio programme PM in April 2001, Hickling agreed with the interviewer, Geoff Thompson, that he supported the law's continued existence and said he was [...] "sorry to say that, in the light of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience,</b> I'm inclined to think you couldn't really safely get rid of it at the moment". Worldwide terrorist attacks such as 9/11 confirmed his views on the matter.|$|E
500|$|... "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder, who had {{a deal with the}} {{producers}} of the show to write five scripts for season ten. Although {{he was the one who}} wrote the episode, Dan Greaney was the one who came up with the idea for it. Greaney based Homer's intense obsession with Edison on the fact that when he himself would have an obsession with something in life, he would badger and bore people with details of it. [...] "Homer's relationship to Thomas Edison's achievements is a version of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> of trying to communicate the experience of things you love by driving people crazy," [...] Greaney said in a DVD audio commentary for the episode. The untippable chair was also an idea of Greaney's; while working on the episode, he was leaning back in his chair and fell backwards. He casually said it would be great if there were legs on the back of the chair and someone in the writing room said that would be a great invention for Homer. Soon after coming up with the story, Greaney told it to Swartzwelder so that he could turn it into a script. Greaney said [...] "it couldn't in my best dreams have turned out as good as it did if I had written it." ...|$|E

2500|$|References to {{film and}} allusions to theatre, literature, dance, painting, {{television}} and advertising [...] "are {{central to the}} world that Almodóvar constructs on screen". Film critic José Arroyo noted that Almodóvar [...] "borrows indiscriminately from film history". Almodóvar has acknowledged that [...] "cinema is always present in my films [...] certain films play an active part in my scripts. When I insert an extract from a film, it isn't a homage but outright theft. It's part of the story I'm telling, and becomes an active presence rather than a homage which is always something passive. I absorb the films I've seen into <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience,</b> which immediately becomes the experience of my characters". Almodóvar has alluded to the work of many different artists and genres in his work; sometimes works have been referenced diagetically or evoked through less direct methods. Almodóvar has additionally made self-references to films within his own oeuvre.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2007 Beat the Blizzard webzine's article, {{the writer}} Jan Lindsø states that [...] "any metal fans {{are of the}} opinion that Christians should 'not be allowed' to use the black metal {{aesthetics}} musically since they do not inherit this evil and perhaps misantropic [...] trait that many people say is necessary in order to be convincing as black metal musicians". Kittil Kittilsen, who left Mayhem in 1988 after becoming a born-again Christian, expressed his concern for the unblack metal musicians: [...] "I think they're completely off the mark. I cannot seriously understand how they even manage to do it. They have missed the target completely. I mean, {{if you want to be}} a Christian, be it with all you've got, and if you want to be metal, be it with all you've got. If those people really took their faith seriously, and followed the instructions of the One they profess to believe in, they would never be found in a context like that. They are on collision course with Christian life and teaching. I say this because of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience,</b> and because of what is written in the Bible; rock music, metal music has nothing at all to do in a Christian setting!" ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{explained}} his particular ethos {{and style of}} management of CSIRO in this way: Well, I suppose I always wanted to extrapolate from <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience,</b> small-scale experience, and some personal opinions. I had a strong desire always to see pure and applied research undertaken {{side by side in}} the same laboratory.... And I was still very much aware that the recognition that many – most, I should say – of the really important and fundamental discoveries in science which subsequently led to a massive technological development have come through curiosity-led research, and often through serendipity, which is terribly important. I think the Birch report was very helpful, and I agreed with his report that the whole core of the policy-making in the science that we were going to carry out was a matter of defining the right proportion of, shall we say, pure research, strategic mission-oriented, and technical research – and getting that proportion right.... I felt that fundamental research in the end was going to reap the real benefits in the long run ... discovering something like electricity ... was absolutely fundamental research and had an enormous impact on the world. On the other hand, there was the awareness that you're in charge of an organisation that's spending a million dollars of taxpayers' money every day, and that's a very sobering thought, so you had to keep the reins on as well. Indeed, there were many frustrations in being CSIRO's Chairman at that time, of which he nominated as the worst [...] "the frustration of finding it so difficult to bring in new young blood because of the descending budget in real terms." ...|$|E
