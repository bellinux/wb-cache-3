It was also {{planned to use}} the Stalingrad Tractor Factory, which was under construction at that time. But {{the production of the}} T-26 proved to be <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>than</b> the semi-handicraft assembly of the MS-1, so the planned production of 500 T-26s in 1931 proved to be impossible. The Bolshevik Factory needed to convert all tank drawings from imperial units into metric, in order to develop a production technology, special tools, and equipment. The first 10 T-26s were assembled in July 1931 – they were identical to British Vickers 6-Ton tanks except for their armament. Soviet tanks were armed with the 37mm Hotchkiss (PS-1) gun in the right turret and the 7.62mm DT tank machine gun in the left turret. These T-26s from the development batch were of low quality and made from mild steel, but it was an important test of the new tank production technology.|$|E

25|$|When a proton is {{coupled to}} two {{different}} protons, then the coupling constants {{are likely to}} be different, and instead of a triplet, a doublet of doublets will be seen. Similarly, if a proton is coupled to two other protons of one type, and a third of another type with a different, smaller coupling constant, then a triplet of doublets is seen. In the example below, the triplet coupling constant is larger than the doublet one. By convention the pattern created by the largest coupling constant is indicated first and the splitting patterns of smaller constants are named in turn. In the case below it would be erroneous to refer to the quartet of triplets as a triplet of quartets. The analysis of such multiplets (which can be <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>than</b> the ones shown here) provides important clues to the structure of the molecule being studied.|$|E

25|$|The basic {{supply and}} demand theory predicts that raising the minimum wage helps workers whose wages are raised, and hurts {{people who are not}} hired (or lose their jobs) when {{companies}} cut back on employment. But proponents of the minimum wage hold that the situation is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>than</b> the basic theory can account for. One complicating factor is possible monopsony in the labor market, whereby the individual employer has some market power in determining wages paid. Thus it is at least theoretically possible that the minimum wage may boost employment when affected employees spend more in other sectors of the economy. Though single employer market power is unlikely to exist in most labor markets {{in the sense of the}} traditional 'company town,' asymmetric information, imperfect mobility, and the personal element of the labor transaction give some degree of wage-setting power to most firms.|$|E

In every respect, the war was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>than</b> they suggest. In recent years, historians have argued persuasively against almost every popular cliché of World War I. It has been pointed out that, although the losses were devastating, their greatest impact was socially and geographically limited. The many emotions other than horror experienced by soldiers {{in and out of}} the front line, including comradeship, boredom, and even enjoyment, have been recognised. The war is not now seen as a 'fight about nothing', but as a war of ideals, a struggle between aggressive militarism and more or less liberal democracy. It has been acknowledged that British generals were often capable men facing difficult challenges, and that it was under their command that the British army played a major part in the defeat of the Germans in 1918: a great forgotten victory.|$|E

The endless working-up practices and landing exercises carried out prior to the Dieppe assault were not confined to training infantry; they were also designed to shake down the crews of the landing craft flotillas. This was necessary because officers and ratings with LCA experience were not left idle after operations, but were reassigned to other pressing duties throughout the Navy. This massive raid required more trained crews and more flotilla coordination. The few experienced LCA hands available had to be supplemented by dozens of new crewmen collected by the RNVR. These {{had to learn how to}} approach a beach, ground on it, disembark troops, ease off the beach, and remain off shore within instant call, ready to come when necessary.|$|E

500|$|Because {{the results}} of {{calculations}} based on Teller's concept were discouraging, many scientists believed it could {{not lead to a}} successful weapon, while others had moral and economic grounds for not proceeding. [...] Consequently, several senior people of the Manhattan Project opposed development, including Bethe and Oppenheimer. To clarify the situation, Ulam and von Neumann resolved to do new calculations to determine whether Teller's approach was feasible. [...] To carry out these studies, von Neumann decided to use electronic computers: ENIAC at Aberdeen, a new computer, MANIAC, at Princeton, and its twin, which was under construction at Los Alamos. [...] Ulam enlisted Everett to follow a completely different approach, one guided by physical intuition. [...] Françoise Ulam was one of a cadre of women [...] "computers" [...] who carried out laborious and extensive computations of thermonuclear scenarios on mechanical calculators, supplemented and confirmed by Everett's slide rule. Ulam and Fermi collaborated on further analysis of these scenarios. [...] The results showed that, in workable configurations, a thermonuclear reaction would not ignite, and if ignited, it would not be self-sustaining. Ulam had used his expertise in Combinatorics to analyze the chain reaction in deuterium, which was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>than</b> the ones in uranium and plutonium, and he concluded that no self-sustaining chain reaction would take place at the (low) densities that Teller was considering.
