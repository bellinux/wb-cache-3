40|$|Objective: Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) is a <b>minimal</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>technique</b> in the {{management}} of carious lesions, which results in negligible dis-comfort to the patient. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess and compare the dis-comfort levels during Atraumatic Restorative Treatment and Minimal Cavity Preparation (MCP: a method using rotary instruments) treatment procedures in a sample of school children in Davangere city. Materials and Methods: An experimental study was performed aimed at com-paring discomfort levels as measured by subjective (Venham index) and objective (Heart rate) methods at six specified moments during the treatment. A total of 200 children were randomly divided into two groups of 100 each. In each child, one class II restoration with GIC in a deciduous molar was performed. One group re-ceived treatment using rotary instruments (MCP) and the other group with ART. Discomfort levels were measured using Venham index (behavioural dimension) and heart rate (physiological dimension) ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Minimal</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>techniques</b> are {{generally}} considered {{in relation to}} initial carious lesions. However, it appears logical to apply the same principles to extensive cavities {{as well as to}} the replacement of failed existing restorations. As the cavity becomes larger, there is an increasing need to consider protection of remaining cusps because they become seriously weakened by loss of the central core of the crown and therefore become subject to the development of splits at the base. However, it is possible to develop a protective cavity design without undue sacrifice of remaining tooth structure, at the same time that maintenance of occlusal anatomy and correct contact with the opposing arch are ensured. For larger cavities, special consideration needs to be given to the strength of the restorative material. Glass ionomer is relatively brittle and should not be exposed to undue occlusal load. Resin composites cannot be regarded as universal in their physical properties, and placement is time-consuming. A lamination technique is often useful, combining the advantages of both glass ionomer and resin composite. Amalgam should not be entirely discarded as an option because it has greater strength than both glass ionomer and resin composite and is still useful for the restoration of extensive cavities and for protection and retention of weakened cusps. <b>Minimal</b> <b>intervention</b> principles, designed to limit the loss of natural tooth structure, should be applied to all restorative dentistry.

40|$|Dental hand {{instruments}} are not efficient in removing all infected dentin when performing carious removal for <b>minimal</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>techniques.</b> The {{use of an}} antibacterial dentin conditioner may therefore be useful when restoring cavities that have residual carious dentin. Antibacterial agents - chlorhexidine hydrochloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, cetrimide, benzalkonium chloride and sodium hypochlorite, were added either to a dentin conditioner used for glass ionomer cements or distilled water at 1 % concentration. Dentin conditioning solutions at pH 2. 5, 4. 9 and 7. 7 were also prepared, along with 1 % aqueous thymol. Using an agar diffusion test, 25 μl aliquots were examined for their inhibitory effects on three cariogenic bacteria. After 24 hours, an agar pellet was extracted adjacent to the agar well and placed on a second inoculated agar plate to observe sustained inhibitory effects, after which this procedure was repeated one more time. Antibacterial dentin conditioners showed significant inhibitory effect compared to the control over the three test periods (p< 0. 016). The combination of dentin conditioners with antibacterial agents significantly reduced the inhibitory effect compared to the antibacterial aqueous solutions (p< 0. 016). One-percent aqueous thymol showed no inhibitory effect against the test bacteria. The cetrimide-dentin conditioner showed the greatest inhibitory effect against all three test bacteria over the three experimental periods (p< 0. 016). The inhibitory effect of antibacterial agents was significantly reduced when combined with a dentin conditioner. Only the cetrimide-dentin conditioner combination produced significant inhibitory effects against all three test organisms. © Operative Dentistry, 2005. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Spectral {{analysis}} {{is now a}} standard procedure for analyzing the electroencephalograms (EEG) obtained by polysomnographic recordings. These numerical methods assume an artifact-free EEG since artifacts create spurious spectral components. Our aim was {{the development of a}} QRS artifact removal technique that might be applied to full night EEG with a <b>minimal</b> human <b>intervention.</b> This <b>technique</b> should handle one EEG channel, with or without use of one ECG channel. Variance minimization, independent component analysis (ICA), morphological filters (MF) have been implemented. Careful attention has been given to define the MF structuring element. The tests on artifact-simulated and real data were checked on the residual ECG spectral components present in the cleaned EEG. The best results are obtained by the MF when the structuring element is an artifact template defined either directly on the EEG or on the ICA ECG component. Further developments are required to identify and subtract the T-wave artifacts. Clinical TrialJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{systematically}} {{review the}} available evidence on {{the efficacy of the}} Pilates method in patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain. METHOD: Searches were performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PEDro, SciELO, LILACS, CINAHL and CENTRAL in March 2013. Randomized controlled trials that tested the effectiveness of the Pilates method (against a nontreatment group, <b>minimal</b> <b>intervention</b> or other types of interventions) in adults with chronic low back pain were included regardless the language of publication. The outcome data were extracted from the eligible studies and were combined using a meta-analysis approach. RESULTS: The searches identified a total of 1, 545 articles. From these, eight trials were considered eligible, and seven trials were combined in the meta-analysis. The comparison groups were as follows: Pilates versus other types of exercises (n= 2 trials), and Pilates versus no treatment group or <b>minimal</b> <b>intervention</b> (n= 4 trials) for short term pain; Pilates versus <b>minimal</b> <b>intervention</b> for short-term disability (n= 4). We determined that Pilates was not better than other types of exercises for reducing pain intensity. However, Pilates was better than a <b>minimal</b> <b>intervention</b> for reducing short-term pain and disability (pain: pooled mean difference= 1. 6 points; 95 % CI 1. 4 to 1. 8; disability: pooled mean difference= 5. 2 points; 95 % CI 4. 3 to 6. 1).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relapse rate {{over a two-year period}} and to search for predictors of relapse among patients who quit benzodiazepine use after receiving a discontinuation letter. METHODS: Baseline assessment and prospective monitoring of the medical records of 109 patients who quit long-term benzodiazepine use after a <b>minimal</b> <b>intervention</b> strategy in general practice. RESULTS: After 819 +/- 100 days of follow-up, 53 (49 %) patients had remained completely abstinent. Two independent predictors of relapse were identified by Cox regression analysis: use of more than 10 mg diazepam equivalent (RR = 2. 4 [1. 2 - 4. 7]) and poor general health perception (RR = 0. 98 [0. 97 - 0. 99]).

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{clinical}} effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a stepped-care <b>intervention</b> versus a <b>minimal</b> <b>intervention</b> {{for the treatment}} of older hazardous alcohol users in primary care. Design: A multi-centre, pragmatic RCT. Setting: Primary care general practices in England and Scotland. Participants: Patients aged >= 55 years scoring >= 8 on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Interventions: <b>Minimal</b> <b>intervention</b> consisted of 5 -minutes of brief advice. Stepped care consisted of an initial 20 -minutes of behavioural change counselling. Step 2 was three sessions of Motivational Enhancement Therapy. Step 3 was a referral to local alcohol services. Progression between each step was determined by outcomes one month after each step. Main outcome measures: Average drinks per day, AUDIT-C, alcohol-related problems using the Drinking Problems Index, health-related quality of life using the Short Form 12. Costs measured from a NHS/Personal Social Care perspective. Estimated health gains in quality adjusted life-years measured assessed EQ- 5 D. Results: Both groups reduced alcohol consumption at 12 months but the difference between groups was small and not significant. No significant differences were observed between the groups on secondary outcomes. In economic terms stepped care was less costly and more effective than the <b>minimal</b> <b>intervention.</b> Conclusions: Stepped care does not confer an advantage over a <b>minimal</b> <b>intervention</b> in terms of reduction in alcohol use for older hazardous alcohol users in primary care. However stepped care has a greater probability of being more cost-effective. Trial Registration: Current controlled trials ISRCTN 5255736...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To {{optimize}} {{the effectiveness of}} cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) for each individual patient, {{it is important to}} discern whether different <b>intervention</b> <b>techniques</b> may be differentially effective. One factor influencing the differential effectiveness of CBT <b>intervention</b> <b>techniques</b> may be the patient's preferred learning style, and whether this is 'matched' to the intervention. METHOD: The current study uses a retrospective analysis to examine whether the impact of two common CBT interventions (thought records and behavioral experiments) is greater when the intervention is either matched or mismatched to the individual's learning style. RESULTS: Results from this study give some indication that greater belief change is achieved when the <b>intervention</b> <b>technique</b> is matched to participants' learning style, than when <b>intervention</b> <b>techniques</b> are mismatched to learning style.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{prevalence}} of benzodiazepine consumption in European countries remains at 2 - 3 % {{of the general}} population despite the well-documented disadvantages of long-term use. AIMS: To review systematically the success rates of different benzodiazepine discontinuation strategies. METHOD: Meta-analysis of comparable intervention studies. RESULTS: Twenty-nine articles met inclusion criteria. Two groups of <b>interventions</b> were identified; <b>minimal</b> <b>intervention</b> (e. g. giving simple advice {{in the form of a}} letter or meeting to a large group of people; n= 3), and systematic discontinuation (defined as treatment programmes led by a physician or psychologist; n= 26). Both were found to be significantly more effective than treatment as usual: <b>minimal</b> <b>interventions</b> (pooled OR= 2. 8, 95 % CI 1. 6 - 5. 1); systematic discontinuation alone (one study, OR= 6. 1, 95 % CI 2. 0 - 18. 6). Augmentation of systematic discontinuation with imipramine (two studies, OR= 3. 1, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 9. 4) or group cognitive-behavioural therapy for patients with insomnia (two studies, OR= 5. 5, 95 % CI 2. 3 - 14. 2) was superior to systematic discontinuation alone.

OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} SSE for acute, subacute, chronic and recurrent LBP. METHODS: Electronic database PubMed was searched for reviews of SSE from November 2008 to March 2009. Keywords were low back pain, lumbar stabilization, segmental stabilizing exercises, spinal stabilization exercises. For chronic LBP, four comparisons were made: Effectiveness of SSE versus <b>minimal</b> <b>intervention,</b> effectiveness of SSE as a supplement, effectiveness of SSE versus other physiotherapy treatment and effectiveness of SSE versus surgery. RESULTS: 17 trials were included. For acute LBP, SSE is equally effective as treatment by general practitioner in reducing short- term pain or disability. For long-term effects after an acute episode of LBP, SSE is more effective in reducing recurrence. For chronic LBP, SSE is more effective than a <b>minimal</b> <b>intervention</b> and may be as effective as other physiotherapeutic treatments in reducing pain and disability. Equal improvement in both groups was measured for surgery. There are no results concerning subacute LBP.

METHODS: We randomly assigned 542 African Americans with type 2 DM {{enrolled in an}} urban managed care organization to either an intensive or <b>minimal</b> <b>intervention</b> group. The intensive intervention group consisted of all components of the <b>minimal</b> <b>intervention</b> plus individualized, culturally tailored care provided by a nurse case manager (NCM) and a community health worker (CHW), using evidence-based clinical algorithms with feedback to primary care providers (eg, physicians, nurse practitioners, or physician assistants). The <b>minimal</b> <b>intervention</b> consisted of mailings and telephone calls every 6 months to remind participants about preventive screenings. Data on diabetic control were collected at baseline and at 24 months by blind observers; data emergency department (ER) visits and hospitalizations were assessed using administrative data. RESULTS: At baseline, participants had {{a mean age of}} 58 years, 73 % were women, and 50 % were living in poverty. At 24 months, compared with the <b>minimal</b> <b>intervention</b> group, those in the intensive intervention group were 23 % less likely to have ER visits (rate difference [RD], - 14. 5; adjusted rate ratio [RR], 0. 77; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 59 - 1. 00). In on-treatment analyses, the rate reduction was strongest for patients who received the most NCM and CHW visits (RD, - 31. 0; adjusted RR, 0. 66; 95 % CI, 0. 43 - 1. 00; rate reduction downward arrow 34 %).

More efficient service delivery using <b>minimal</b> <b>interventions</b> (such as bibliotherapy) provided by paraprofessional therapists may be one method of overcoming these problems, and is the subject of attention in the UK and elsewhere. A randomized trial was conducted to test the clinical effectiveness of this model. Assistant psychologists delivered a guided self-help intervention to patients with anxiety and depression who were currently waiting for psychological therapy. Method. A total of 114 patients were randomized either to guided self-help or a waiting-list control group. All patients were followed up 3 months later, prior to starting conventional psychological therapy. Measures included self-reported adherence to the intervention, anxiety and depressive symptoms, social functioning and patient satisfaction. Results. Adherence to the guided self-help intervention was acceptable and patients reported satisfaction with the intervention. However, there were no statistically significant differences between groups in anxiety and depression symptoms at 3 months. Conclusions. The results demonstrate that this model of guided self-help did not provide additional benefit to patients on a waiting list for psychological therapy.
