25|$|Quantum-enhanced machine {{learning}} refers to quantum algorithms that solve tasks in {{machine learning}}, thereby improving a classical machine learning method. Such algorithms typically require one to encode the given classical dataset into a quantum computer, {{so as to}} make it accessible for quantum information processing. After this, quantum information processing routines can be applied and the result of the quantum computation is read out by measuring the quantum system. For example, the outcome of the measurement of a qubit could reveal the result of a binary classification task. While many proposals of quantum <b>machine</b> <b>learning</b> <b>algorithms</b> are still purely theoretical and require a full-scale universal quantum computer to be tested, others have been implemented on small-scale or special purpose quantum devices.|$|E
25|$|Unsupervised {{learning}} {{is the ability}} to find patterns in a stream of input. Supervised learning includes both classification and numerical regression. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in, after seeing a number of examples of things from several categories. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change. In reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent uses this sequence of rewards and punishments to form a strategy for operating in its problem space. These three types of learning can be analyzed in terms of decision theory, using concepts like utility. The mathematical analysis of <b>machine</b> <b>learning</b> <b>algorithms</b> and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory.|$|E
25|$|Igor Aizenberg {{and colleagues}} {{introduced}} it to Artificial Neural Networks in 2000. The first functional Deep Learning networks were published by Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko and V. G. Lapa in 1965. These networks are trained one layer at a time. Ivakhnenko's 1971 paper describes {{the learning of}} a deep feedforward multilayer perceptron with eight layers, already much deeper than many later networks. In 2006, a publication by Geoffrey Hinton and Ruslan Salakhutdinov introduced another way of pre-training many-layered feedforward neural networks (FNNs) one layer at a time, treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted Boltzmann machine, then using supervised backpropagation for fine-tuning. Similar to shallow artificial neural networks, deep neural networks can model complex non-linear relationships. Over the last few years, advances in both <b>machine</b> <b>learning</b> <b>algorithms</b> and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units and a very large output layer.|$|E

2500|$|Many of the {{commonly}} used <b>machine</b> <b>learning</b> <b>algorithms</b> require {{a set of}} training examples consisting of both a hypothetical input and a desired answer. [...] In many robot learning applications the desired answer is an action for the robot to take. These actions are usually not known explicitly a priori, instead the robot can, at best, receive a value indicating {{the success or failure}} of a given action taken. [...] Evolutionary algorithms are natural solutions to this sort of problem framework, as the fitness function need only encode {{the success or failure of}} a given controller, rather than the precise actions the controller should have taken. [...] An alternative to the use of evolutionary computation in robot learning is the use of other forms of reinforcement learning, such as q-learning, to learn the fitness of any particular action, and then use predicted fitness values indirectly to create a controller.|$|E
