40|$|There {{are limited}} studies that turn the lens on an organization’s chosen patient-centered care program, {{and there is}} a gap in the {{literature}} that exists for defining shared values within these models. The purpose of this research was to identify and analyze emergent themes related to various stakeholders. This includes exploring the definition of patient-centered care from the perspective of medical professionals and patients to determine if an association of shared values exists. The research was accomplished through a descriptive, single, embedded-case study to develop defining characteristics of the phenomenon of patient-centered care for patients and medical professionals in a large, urban, acute healthcare setting. The research was conducted using a qualitative case study design with a focused methodological triangulation process that consisted of a cross verification of two sources of data related to the same phenomenon of patient-centered care. The purpose of the triangulation of data was to explain more accurately the complexity and connections from both the patient and medical professional perspective. Triangulation of the data showed that there were clear connections for both medical professionals and patients relating to the value of family inclusion, consistent communications, human connections, and the provision of comfort measures in the patient-care process. Based on the research, it is recommended that medical professionals and the patients they serve have the opportunity to share their voices. Furthermore, it is recommended that health care institutions <b>make</b> <b>an</b> effort <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> together those populations to get to the recognition and understanding of their shared values...|$|R
40|$|Alternative {{modes of}} {{academic}} publication. What it is: Page for {{the dissemination of}} academic papers in alternative formats. Aimed at the diffusion {{of the idea of}} open publication, or open access publication, a branch of open science, a multidisciplinary movement that seeks to modify the paradigm of knowledge production that centralizes it and prevents its spreading. Historically, Western tradition has become firmly rooted in the free dissemination of knowledge among peers. However, the concentration of research funding, publication channels and creative capacity around closed institutions of production and publication of knowledge interrupted this tradition on a large scale. Diverse movements inspired by the concepts of free software and open source have joined to form the still evolving concept of open science. This page is not an electronic journal, or periodical, or newspaper, or repository of pre-publications. Like the concepts that I want to defend, I want this creation to be an alternative publication modality itself. The project starts as follows: 	It is a one-man venture (for now), but open to contributions 	No periodicity ("published" material is identified by the versioning) 	There will be no requirement for quality, except for the unambiguous evidence base. - Example: you will not see in this page texts about UFOs or alternative (pseudo) science (the alternative in this page is the format) 	It will not have a peer review system, but will be open to the free commentary, provided the Code of Conduct is followed. 	There will never be monetary charges (but I will accept donations). How to use: The information disclosed will always be made available by free licenses compatible with the Open Science movement, especially (but not exclusively) the Creative Commons Attribution 4. 0 International license. No copyrighted or proprietary copyrighted content will be published, but citations to such protected material may occur if comments on other publications are published. Plagiarism will not be tolerated. By obeying these principles and the consensual ethics of the academic community, any and all available material may be reused, modified, quoted, linked to other pages, or compiled into databases. Disclosure: The project has a webpage generated by GitHub Pages, which can be seen here. How to contribute: Because the page is available in a GitHub repository, the main contribution process is streamlined by it. If you still do not have a GitHub (free) account, sign up, open an issue or duplicate (fork) the repository, add content and <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>pull</b> request) <b>to</b> the project. In addition, there is the most usual way of contributing: send an email (any format handled by pandoc), or use any of the social networks that I make available. Finally, comments on the published texts are very welcome. Give your opinion!

40|$|How does parental {{education}} affect time in {{the paid}} workforce and time with children? Potentially, the effects are contradictory. An economic perspective suggests higher education means <b>a</b> <b>pull</b> <b>to</b> the market. Human capital theory predicts that, because higher education improves earning capacity, educated women face higher opportunity costs if they forego wages, so will allocate more time to market work and less to unpaid domestic labour. But education may also exercise <b>a</b> <b>pull</b> <b>to</b> the home. Attitudes to child rearing are subject to strong social norms, and parents {{with higher levels of}} education may be particularly receptive to the current social ideal of attentive, sustained and intensive nurturing. Using data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics Time-use Survey 1997, this study offers a snapshot of how these contradictory pulls play out in daily life. It finds that inAustralia, households with university-educated parents spend more daily time with children than other households in physical care and in developmental activities. Sex inequality in care time persists, but fathers with university education do contribute more time to care of children, including time alone with them, than other fathers. Mothers with university education allocate more daily time than other mothers to both childcare and to paid work...|$|R
