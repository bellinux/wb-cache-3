25|$|A {{destructive}} earthquake occurred {{two days}} before the mainshock at 21:00 local time, centered in the Val di Noto. It had an estimated magnitude of 6.2 and a maximum perceived intensity of VIII–XI on the Mercalli intensity scale. Intensities of VIII or higher have been estimated for Augusta, Avola Vecchia, Floridia, Melilli, Noto Antica, Catania, Francofonte, Lentini, Scicli, Sortino and Vizzini. Augusta lies well outside the <b>main</b> <b>zone</b> of severe shaking; its extensive damage is probably due to its construction on unconsolidated sediments.|$|E
25|$|A {{new view}} is {{developing}} that the regional tectonic boundary is not under Hood Canal, {{but just to}} the west, involving the Saddle Mountain fault zone (discussed below) and associated faults. This is supported by geologically recent scarps and other signs of active faulting on the Saddle Mountain faults, and also discovery of a geophysical lineament running through Pleasant Harbor (south of Brinnon) that appears to truncate strands of the Seattle Fault. In this view Hood Canal is only a syncline (dip) between the Olympic Mountains and the Puget Lowland, and such faults as have been found there are local and discontinuous, ancillary to the <b>main</b> <b>zone</b> of faulting to the west. North of the Seattle Fault accommodation of regional movement may be along the northwest-striking Dabob Bay Fault Zone.|$|E
25|$|Tower tombs of this period, such as {{the tomb}} of Abdas-Samad Esfahani in Natanz, {{sometimes}} have muqarnas domes, although they are usually plaster shells that hide the underlying structures. The tall proportions of the Jameh Mosque of Varamin resulted primarily from the increased height of the zone of transition, {{with the addition of}} a sixteen-sided section above the <b>main</b> <b>zone</b> of muqarnas squinches. The 7.5 meter wide double dome of Soltan Bakht Agha Mausoleum (1351–1352) is the earliest known example in which the two shells of the dome have significantly different profiles, which spread rapidly throughout the region. The inner and outer shells had radial stiffeners and struts between them. An early example of a dome chamber almost completely covered with decorative tilework is that of the Jame Mosque of Yazd (1364), as well as several of the mausoleums of Shah-i-Zinda in Samarkand. The development of taller drums also continued into the Timurid period.|$|E

Each <b>main</b> <b>zone</b> is split into three acts, all of which must be completed by the player. At the end of each main zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik for a boss fight. [...] For most of the fights, Robotnik's vehicle is fitted with different weapons. After completing the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the single-level [...] "Final Zone" [...] for a last encounter with Robotnik inside a large machine environment. [...] Destroying Robotnik's machine ends the game. [...] A brief animation shows Sonic's return to the game's first zone, with animals liberated from Robotnik.|$|E
2500|$|One {{variation}} on the standard annular combustor is the double annular combustor (DAC). Like an annular combustor, the DAC is a continuous ring without separate combustion zones around the radius. The {{difference is that the}} combustor has two combustion zones around the ring; a pilot zone and a <b>main</b> <b>zone.</b> The pilot zone acts like that of a single annular combustor, and is the only zone operating at low power levels. At high power levels, the <b>main</b> <b>zone</b> is used as well, increasing air and mass flow through the combustor. GE's implementation of this type of combustor focuses on reducing NOx and CO2 emissions[...] Extending the same principles as the double annular combustor, triple annular and [...] "multiple annular" [...] combustors have been proposed and even patented.|$|E

The German failures at the Battle of Verdun in December 1916 and at the Battle of Arras in April 1917 had given more importance to these areas, since the forward zones had been overrun and the garrisons lost.
