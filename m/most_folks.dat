25|$|Mark Tauber, senior {{vice-president}} of HarperOne, {{has stated that}} the Green Bible was developed {{with the intention of}} being “the first ever specialty bible that takes the issues of sustainability, stewardship of the earth, what many in the religious community call ‘creation care’ very seriously”. He went further, exposing on the Green Bible’s purpose: “That the Bible has a profound message of sustainability—some might argue, the original message—is not all that surprising. What is surprising {{is that it is not}} one of the first things that comes to mind when <b>most</b> <b>folks</b> think about the Bible and its message... this Bible seeks to change that fact. We believe that the unique and specially added features by some of today's most important thinkers, writers and leaders, across the ecumenical spectrum make it a must-have for those who already find motivation, comfort and inspiration in it and for the many more who might see it freshly as a critical resource in their journey to sustain our planet”.|$|E

Freestyle boards are up to [...] wide, to assist with balance. Alpine boards are typically [...] wide, although they can be as narrow as [...] <b>Most</b> <b>folks</b> ride boards in the [...] range. Riders with larger feet (US size 10 and larger) may have problems with narrower boards, as the rider's toes and/or heels may extend {{over the edge of}} the board, and interfere with the board's ability to make turns once it is set on edge, or 'get hung up on the snow.' This is called toe/heel-drag, and can be cured by either choosing a wider board ( [...] or more), adjusting the stance angle, or a combination of the two.|$|E

2500|$|On 29 July 2010 WikiLeaks {{added an}} [...] "Insurance file" [...] to the Afghan War Diary page. The file is AES encrypted. There has been {{speculation}} {{that it was}} intended to serve as insurance in case the WikiLeaks website or its spokesman Julian Assange are incapacitated, upon which the passphrase could be published. After the first few days' release of the US diplomatic cables starting 28 November 2010, the US television broadcasting company CBS predicted that [...] "If anything happens to Assange or the website, a key will go out to unlock the files. There would then be no way to stop the information from spreading like wildfire because so many people already have copies." [...] CBS correspondent Declan McCullagh stated, [...] "What <b>most</b> <b>folks</b> are speculating is that the insurance file contains unreleased information that would be especially embarrassing to the US government if it were released." ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Most</b> <b>folk</b> dances {{regarded}} as Dutch are Scottish origin, like Skotse trije, Skotse fjouwer, horlepiep of hakke toone. In the East of the Netherlands dances like Driekusman, Hoksebarger, Veleta, Kruispolka and the Spaanse Wals are of German origin.|$|R

60|$|Seek-Seek chuckled. He {{had quite}} {{forgotten}} {{that he had}} felt offended because Peter had mistaken him for his cousin, Striped Chipmunk. He enjoyed Peter's admiration of his coat. He is naturally rather talkative, and like <b>most</b> <b>folks</b> he enjoyed talking about himself.|$|E
50|$|While unpopular with train crews {{stationed}} {{there because}} of its relative isolation and limited shopping and education facilities, these drawbacks were offset with a daily financial allowance and an extra day's paid leave for every month served by workers.

50|$|After the Second World War this {{industry}} quickly declined as {{new methods of}} abstracting salt by solution mining replaced the old fashioned pumping of wild brine and its attendant subsidence. The village quickly became a residential area with <b>most</b> <b>folk</b> working in nearby Northwich or Winsford. New housing development in the mid-1960s increased the population by over 60%.|$|R

5000|$|... "Hush, Little Baby" [...] is a {{traditional}} lullaby, {{thought to have been}} written in the Southern United States.

6000|$|... "Well, well, I'm only puttin' {{it as an}} argument," [...] said Lord John. [...] "If you {{all want}} to see it through I am with you. It's dooced interestin', and no mistake about that.

6000|$|... "Better 'n' <b>most</b> <b>folks</b> 'round here did. Once er twicet a {{year the}} Cap'n 'd go to Bob's office an' set around an' smoke his pipe.

50|$|Like <b>most</b> <b>folk</b> {{sponsored}} {{practices such}} as the night markets in Taiwan, funeral stripping {{does not seem to}} be rubbing shoulders with the law, not if necessary.

Managers of the event are careful to restrict the amount of skin shown during the performances.|$|R
5000|$|Harmonium was the eponymous {{debut album}} by Québécois band Harmonium {{released}} in 1974.
