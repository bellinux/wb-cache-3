5|$|A second movie, titled Terry, {{focused on}} the Marathon of Hope, was {{produced}} by the CTV Television Network in 2005. Fox was portrayed by Shawn Ashmore. He is not an amputee; digital editing was used to superimpose a prosthesis over his real leg. The film was endorsed by Fox's family, and portrayed his attitude <b>more</b> <b>positively</b> than the first movie. Canadian National Basketball Association star Steve Nash, who himself was inspired by Fox {{when he was a}} child, directed a 2010 documentary Into the Wind, which aired on ESPN as part of its 30 for 30 series.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the live-action television series, the Justice League has also been featured in a promotional tie-in with Toyota, through an interactive, online comic book. On an individual level, Oliver Queen received his own tie-in that provided Sprint users with animated episodes depicting Oliver's backstory on their mobile phones. Overall, the reception for the characters has been mixed. Critics have viewed Ritchson's acting ability and the shortened introductory storylines for the team negatively, while the characters of Green Arrow and Black Canary were viewed <b>more</b> <b>positively.</b>|$|E
5|$|The party's {{views on}} the United States and the Middle East have evolved over time. Despite the anti-American views of some right-wing forums in the 1970s and 1980s (that chiefly were rooted in worries over US {{cultural}} expansion and hegemonic role in world politics {{at the expense of}} Europe), the FPÖ were <b>more</b> <b>positively</b> inclined towards the United States under Haider's leadership in the late 1980s and 1990s. However, this changed in 2003 following Haider visiting Saddam Hussein {{on the eve of the}} Iraq War; he subsequently condemned US foreign policy and derided George W. Bush for not being very different from Hussein. This move was strongly criticised by the FPÖ, which was part of the then-current government. Nevertheless, in the mid- to late 2000s the FPÖ too criticised US foreign policy as promoted by Bush, which it saw as leading to increased levels of violence in the Middle East. The party also became more critical of Israel's part in the Israel-Palestine conflict.|$|E

5|$|While {{scholars}} {{have proposed a}} number of hypotheses {{to explain why the}} poem was written, a definitive answer to this question remains elusive. But regardless of Proba's intent, there is evidence that the poem was widely circulated, and it eventually was used in schools to teach the tenets of Christianity, alongside Augustine of Hippo's De Doctrina Christiana. Critical reception to the poem, however, was more mixed. A pseudonymous work purportedly by Pope Gelasius I disparaged the poem, deeming it apocryphal. Many also believe that St. Jerome disliked the poem. At the same time, others like Isidore of Seville, Petrarch, and Giovanni Boccaccio wrote highly of Proba. During the 19th and 20th centuries the poem was criticized as being of poor quality, but recent {{scholars have}} written <b>more</b> <b>positively</b> about it.|$|E
5|$|Sainsbury batting scores {{dipped in}} county cricket during 1879; in nine {{appearances}} for Somerset during the year, his highest score was 39. He performed {{better with the}} ball, twice taking four wickets during an innings, against both Bedfordshire and the MCC. The following county season began <b>more</b> <b>positively</b> for Sainsbury, as he collected nine wickets in the match against Sussex at Lansdown's ground in Bath, claiming six wickets for 54runs in the second innings of the game. He claimed another eight wickets when Somerset travelled to Leicestershire, during which Sainsbury and Arnold Fothergill took five wickets each in Leicestershire's first innings, restricting the home side to 51runs. Somerset won the low-scoring contest by 85runs, Sainsbury having scored a valuable 28 during his side's first innings. Somerset's visit to Sussex saw Sainsbury continue his success against the county, {{this time with the}} bat rather than the ball. Sussex built on their 63 run first innings lead with a second innings total of 183, leaving Somerset the task of scoring 247 runs to win the match. Sainsbury scored his second century for Somerset, remaining 101 not out when Somerset reached the winning total. He was assisted by a half-century from Stephen Newton, and scores in the twenties by Bill Fowler and Frederick Smith. Later that month, his batting was once again instrumental in setting up a Somerset victory, when he top-scored with 87 as Somerset beat the MCC by an innings.|$|E

25|$|Uyghur views vary by the oasis {{they live}} in. China has {{historically}} favored Turpan and Hami. Uyghurs in Turfan and Hami {{and their leaders}} like Emin Khoja allied with the Qing against Uyghurs in Altishahr. During the Qing dynasty, China enfeoffed the rulers of Turpan and Hami (Kumul) as autonomous princes, {{while the rest of}} the Uyghurs in Altishahr (the Tarim Basin) were ruled by Begs. Uyghurs from Turpan and Hami were appointed by China as officials to rule over Uyghurs in the Tarim Basin. Turpan is more economically prosperous and views China <b>more</b> <b>positively</b> than the rebellious Kashgar, which is the most anti-China oasis. Uyghurs in Turpan are treated leniently and favourably by China with regards to religious policies, while Kashgar is subjected to controls by the government. In Turpan and Hami, religion is viewed <b>more</b> <b>positively</b> by China than religion in Kashgar and Khotan in southern Xinjiang. Both Uyghur and Han Communist officials in Turpan turn a blind eye to the law and allow religious Islamic education for Uyghur children. Celebrating at religious functions and going on Hajj to Mecca is encouraged by the Chinese government, for Uyghur members of the Communist party. From 1979-1989, 350 mosques were built in Turpan. Han, Hui, and the Chinese government are viewed much <b>more</b> <b>positively</b> by Uyghurs specifically in Turpan, with the government providing better economic, religious, and political treatment for them.|$|E
