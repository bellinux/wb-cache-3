40|$|The {{significance}} of evolving mixtures structural spectroscopic studies might appear limited when the experimental spectra do not present a sufficient quality for a precise interpretation. It {{is the case}} when the chemical behaviour of macromolecules is studied {{on the basis of}} infrared spectra. If the effective resolution is low, the spectral profiles appear similar despite the applied chemical conditions change. This makes impossible the interpretation of the raw spectra and mathematical treatments are required to separate the different contributions that overlap. To determine the behaviour of the reactive sites of humic acids in the binding with heavy metals, infrared spectra are recorded under various chemical conditions. The cation to be considered is Pb 2 + and the two chemical variables to be studied are pH and initial lead concentration. Four series of FTIR spectra are recorded, but no visible difference can be directly assigned to the different chemical states of the macromolecules. <b>Multivariate</b> self-modelling <b>curve</b> <b>resolution</b> is thus proposed as a tool for resolving these complex and strong overlapping datasets.

In a further step, the application of the <b>multivariate</b> <b>curve</b> resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) algorithm with additional constraints on each individual dataset, as well as on column-wise augmented matrices, allows to optimise the profiles and spectra that appear to be highly characterising the acid and the salt form of the molecule.

40|$|In {{chemical}} analyses, it {{is crucial}} to distinguish between chemical species. This is often accomplished via chromatographic separations. These separations are often pushed to their limits {{in terms of the number}} of analytes that can be sufficiently resolved from one another, particularly when a quantitative analysis of these compounds is needed. Very often, complicated methods or new technology is required to provide adequate separation of samples arising from a variety of fields such as metabolomics, environmental science, food analysis, etc. An often overlooked means for improving analysis is the use of chemometric data analysis techniques. Particularly, the use of chemometric <b>curve</b> <b>resolution</b> techniques can mathematically resolve analyte signals that may be overlapped in the instrumental data. The use of chemometric techniques facilitates quantitation, pattern recognition, or any other desired analyses. Unfortunately, these methods have seen little use outside of traditionally chemometrics focused research groups. In this dissertation, we attempt to show the utility of one of these methods, <b>multivariate</b> <b>curve</b> resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS), to liquid chromatography as well as its application to more advanced separation techniques. First, a general characterization of the performance of MCR-ALS for the analysis of liquid chromatography-diode array detection (LC-DAD) data is accomplished. It is shown that under a wide range of conditions (low chromatographic resolution, low signal-to-noise, and high similarity between analyte spectra), MCR-ALS is able to increase the number of quantitatively analyzable peaks. This increase is up to five-fold in many cases. Second, a novel methodology for MCR-ALS analysis of comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC x LC) is described. This method, called two dimensional assisted liquid chromatography (2 DALC), aims to improve quantitation in LC x LC by combining the advantages of both one-dimensional and two dimensional chromatographic data. We show that 2 DALC can provide superior quantitation to both LC x LC and one dimensional LC under certain conditions. Finally, we apply MCR-ALS to an LC x LC analysis of fourteen furanocoumarins in three apiaceous vegetables. The optimal implementation of MCR-ALS and subsequent integration was determined. For these data, simply performing MCR-ALS on the two dimensional chromatogram and manually integrating the results proved to be the superior method.

40|$|In this paper, {{augmentation}} {{has been}} applied to data matrices, which originate from hyphenated methods that share the same mode of detection, but use different separation methods, HPLC-DAD and MEKC-DAD. A novel method, wavelength shift eigenstructure tracking (WET), has been proposed for the alignment between the wavelength scale of both detectors. WET proves to be suitable for the detection as well as correction of wavelength shift between both detectors. After correction of the wavelength scale, data obtained on both systems have been augmented and submitted to iterative target transformation factor analysis. Augmented <b>curve</b> <b>resolution</b> provides significantly better estimates of the chromatographic and electrophoretic profiles and spectra than the use of non-augmented <b>curve</b> <b>resolution</b> on HPLC and MEKC data separately. It is particularly useful when the pure fraction of a chromatographic peak is less than 0. 10. Finally, the relative weight of MEKC versus HPLC in augmentation may be increased using intensity and noise normalisation. However, since noise normalisation and its accompanying decrease in signal-to-noise ratio leads to a loss of information, and, since intensity normalisation may cause a failure of the augmented <b>curve</b> <b>resolution</b> algorithm, benefits and drawbacks of normalisation should be weighed on a case-by-case basis.

40|$|AbstractMultivariate <b>Curve</b> <b>Resolution</b> with Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) is a <b>curve</b> <b>resolution</b> method {{based on}} a {{bilinear}} model which assumes that the observed spectra are a linear combination of the spectra of the pure components in the system. The algorithm steps include {{the determination of the}} number of components by rank analysis methods, initial estimates for the concentrations and/or spectra and an iterative optimization. Sometimes, suitable results may not be achieved when MCR-ALS is applied. One reason for this is the importance of the initial estimates of the spectral profiles. In that case, the MCR-ALS algorithm may reach a local minimum instead of a global minimum and this can result in ineffective <b>curve</b> <b>resolution.</b> The most popular algorithm used to find the initial estimates (PURE derived from SIMPLISMA) suffers from an essential drawback, which is the necessity to have “pure” variables related to a single spectral component, which cannot be expected in all cases because of the strong signal overlapping as in the Ultraviolet–Visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopy. This work summarizes this problem, presenting a case study based on UV–Vis spectroscopy of heated olive oil. To solve the problems of the need for “pure” variables and to avoid local minima with MCR-ALS, Independent Components Analysis (ICA) was used to calculate initial estimates for MCR-ALS.

However, there are major drawbacks inherent to MSI related to the high complexity of the data obtained from real samples and to the extremely huge size of the datasets generated by this technique.

More recently, independent component analysis (ICA) has been reported {{as an alternative to}} MCR. Those algorithms attempt to infer a model describing the observed data and, therefore, the least squares regression used in MCR assumes that the data is a linear combination of that model. However, due to the high complexity of real data, the construction of a model to describe optimally the observed data is a critical step and these algorithms should prevent the influence from outlier data. This study proves independent component regression (ICR) as an alternative for GC-MS compound identification. Both ICR and MCR though require least squares regression to correctly resolve the mixtures. In this paper, a novel orthogonal signal deconvolution (OSD) approach is introduced, which uses principal component analysis to determine the compound spectra.
