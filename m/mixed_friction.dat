40|$|Axial {{piston pumps}} are {{integral}} {{to a variety}} of hydraulic systems due to their versatility and reliability, but most attempts to model them for design purposes have failed. However, software which fully models the fluid structures within these pumps, such as the FSTI gap design program, has improved significantly. Unfortunately, current discrepancies between simulated and measured friction forces on the cylinder due to the fluid drag and piston movement need to be eliminated so that more accurate simulation of these pumps in operation is possible. Friction measurements and FSTI simulation outputs were analyzed with MATLAB filters and graphs, resulting in the conclusion that <b>mixed</b> <b>friction,</b> a form of partially lubricated contact friction, is the best explanation for the discrepancy. To model and predict the <b>mixed</b> <b>friction,</b> the Stribeck curve, a relationship between piston velocity, fluid viscosity, contact pressure, and the coefficient of friction between the piston and cylinder, was used, allowing a computational model to be developed to post-process the FSTI results and determine the <b>mixed</b> <b>friction.</b> The greatly improved model resulted in simulated total friction increases of nearly 300 percent in cases involving rough surfaces and high pressures.

The current boronizing processes allow obtaining surface layers of high hardness and high resistance to corrosion and wear, with low brittleness and no tendencies towards cracking However, the operation characteristics of these layers depend on the chemical composition, the structure of the surface layer, the method and parameters of their production, as well as any possible thermal treatment. The tribological evaluation included ion nitriding, powder-pack boronizing, laser boronizing, hardening and tempering surface layers and TiB 2 coating deposited on ring samples.

40|$|In the autumn, {{railroad}} {{traffic is}} often interrupted {{due to the}} occurrence of slippery tracks. The Dutch main operator (NS) and the infrastructure manager (ProRail) struggle with repeated delays. The layer between wheel and rail causing this phenomenon {{has not yet been}} identified, but can be quantified by rheological properties determined by correlating the measured friction between wheel and rail and the developed friction model. To this end, the research described in this thesis is twofold: theoretical; in which the wheel - rail contact is modelled in terms of contact and friction, and experimental; in which the friction between wheel and rail is measured to validate the developed model. The contact model between wheel and rail is approximated to be elliptical, which is shown to be accurate for the described purpose. The low friction situation is assumed to be caused by an interfacial layer, which is acting like a lubricant. Combining these two assumptions, a <b>mixed</b> lubrication <b>friction</b> model is developed for the Hertzian elliptical contact situation in which the interfacial layer is acting as a lubricant governed by the Eyring model. The <b>mixed</b> lubrication <b>friction</b> model results in the so-called Stribeck curve and/or the traction curve, which both take frictional heating and starved conditions into consideration. In addition, the changes in attack angle are also taken into account and a general viscoelastic model is proposed for both interfacial and boundary layers. For the experiments, two devices were developed to be mounted on a train and successfully used on the real track. One is a sliding sensor which measures the coefficient of friction between a curved shaped specimen pressed against and sliding along the rail, i. e. simple sliding conditions. A second device measures traction curves between a measuring wheel and the head (top) of the rail, i. e. rolling/sliding conditions, at velocities of up to 100 km/h.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the MHD energy bypass air-breathing engine for high-speed propulsion is analyzed in this investigation. This engine is {{a specific type of}} the general class of inverse cycle engines. In this paper, the general relationship between engine performance (specific impulse and specific thrust) and the overall total pressure ratio through an engine (from inlet plane to exit plane) is first developed and illustrated. Engines with large total pressure decreases, regardless of cause or source, are seen to have exponentially decreasing performance. The ideal inverse cycle engine (of which the MHD engine is a sub-set) is then demonstrated to have a significant total pressure decrease across the engine; this total pressure decrease is cycle-driven, degrades rapidly with energy bypass ratio, and is independent of any irreversibility. The ideal MHD engine (inverse cycle engine with no irreversibility other than that inherent in the MHD work interaction processes) is next examined and is seen to have an additional large total pressure decrease due to MHD-generated irreversibility in the decelerator and the accelerator. This irreversibility mainly occurs in the deceleration process. Both inherent total pressure losses (inverse cycle and MHD irreversibility) result in a significant narrowing of the performance capability of the MHD bypass engine. The fundamental characteristics of MHD flow acceleration and flow deceleration from the standpoint of irreversibility and second-law constraints are next examined in order to clarify issues regarding flow losses and parameter selection in the MM modules. Severe constraints are seen to exist in the decelerator in terms of allowable deceleration Mach numbers and volumetric (length) required for meaningful energy bypass (work interaction). Considerable difficulties are also encountered and discussed due to thermal/work choking phenomena associated with the deceleration process. Lastly, full engine simulations utilizing inlet shock systems, finite-rate chemistry, wall cooling with thermally balanced engine (fuel heat sink), fuel injection and <b>mixing,</b> <b>friction,</b> etc. are shown and discussed for both the MHD engine and the conventional scramjet. The MHD bypass engine has significantly lower performance in all categories across the Mach number range (8 to 12. 2). The lower performance is attributed to the combined effects of 1) additional irreversibility and cooling requirements associated with the MHD components and 2) the total pressure decrease associated with the inverse cycle itself...|$|R
