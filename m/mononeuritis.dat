5000|$|Diabetic neuropathy, {{abnormal}} {{and decreased}} sensation, {{usually in a}} 'glove and stocking' distribution starting with the feet but potentially in other nerves, later often fingers and hands.

50|$|<b>Mononeuritis</b> multiplex, {{occasionally}} termed polyneuritis multiplex, is simultaneous or sequential {{involvement of}} individual noncontiguous nerve trunks, either partially or completely, evolving over days to years and typically presenting with acute or subacute loss of sensory and motor function of individual nerves. The pattern of involvement is asymmetric, however, as the disease progresses, deficit(s) becomes more confluent and symmetrical, {{making it difficult}} to differentiate from polyneuropathy. Therefore, attention to the pattern of early symptoms is important.|$|E

50|$|Small vessels like vasa vasorum and vasa nervorum are {{particularly}} susceptible to external mechanical compression.

Occlusion of vasa nervosum at level of epineurial arterioles leads to ischemia of nerves leading to vasculitic neuropathy. and has been implicated as cause in few cases of facial nerve paralysis. During invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures, injecting a vasoconstrictor close to nerve can reduce perfusion to its supplying vessel, risking ischemic nerve injury.|$|E
5000|$|Each nettle tentacle is {{coated with}} {{thousands}} of microscopic cnidocytes; in turn, every individual cnidocyte has a [...] "trigger" [...] (cnidocil) paired with a capsule containing a coiled stinging filament. Upon contact, the cnidocil will immediately initiate a process which ejects the venom-coated filament from its capsule and into the target. This will inject toxins capable of killing smaller prey or stunning perceived predators. On humans, this will most likely cause a nonlethal, but nevertheless painful rash typically persisting for about 20 minutes. Some earlier cases of nettle stings from the Philippines reportedly had more severe effects: one account describes a sting causing vascular insufficiency, and another <b>mononeuritis.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{compression}} neuropathy {{can usually}} be diagnosed confidently {{on the basis of}} the symptoms and signs alone. However, nerve conduction studies are helpful in confirming the diagnosis, quantifying the severity, and ruling out involvement of other nerves (suggesting a <b>mononeuritis</b> multiplex or polyneuropathy). A scan is not usually necessary, but may be helpful if a tumour or other local compressive lesion is suspected.Nerve injury, as a mononeuropathy, may cause similar symptoms to compression neuropathy. This may occasionally cause diagnostic confusion, particularly if the patient does not remember the injury and there are no obvious physical signs to suggest it.The symptoms and signs of each particular syndrome are discussed on the relevant pages, listed below.|$|E
