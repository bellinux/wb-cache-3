40|$|Immediately after {{undergoing}} emergency {{mitral valve}} replacement, a 60 -year-old woman suffered acute postoperative right heart failure {{and could not}} be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass, despite treatment with multiple drugs. Circulatory assistance was instituted by means of femoro-femoral bypass with a roller pump and a hollow-fiber oxygenator; inotropic drugs and drugs aimed at reducing pulmonary vascular resistance (nitroprusside, <b>moxaverine,</b> and isoproterenol) were also given. The patient's systolic pulmonary pressure underwent a progressive decrease, but her systolic systemic pressure remained below 60 mmHg until 8. 5 hours after aortic clamp release, when we were able to begin an infusion of prostaglandin E 1, a drug not readily available in our hospital. Fifteen minutes after the infusion was started, at 5 ng/kg/min, the patient's systolic systemic pressure reached 85 mmHg and her systolic pulmonary pressure decreased to 55 mmHg. During the next 2 hours, epinephrine treatment was discontinued, and the assisted circulatory flow was reduced to 0. 5 L/min/m 2, while the PGE 1 infusion was increased to 10 ng/kg/min. Assisted circulation was soon discontinued, and the patient's hemodynamic condition remained stable. (Texas Heart Institute Journal 1989; 16 : 110 - 2...|$|E
40|$|Although a few {{experimental}} {{approaches to}} isolated limb perfusion (ILP) {{are described in}} the literature, none of these animal models mimics the clinical perfusion techniques adequately to improve the technique of ILP {{on the basis of}} valid preclinical data. Therefore, we developed an ILP setup in rats allowing online monitoring of essential perfusion parameters such as temperature (in perfusate, various tissues, and rectum), pH (perfusate), perfusion pressure, and O(2) concentration (in perfusate, tissue), by a tailor-made data acquisition system. This setup permits close supervision of vital parameters during ILP. Various interdependencies, concerning the flow rate and the pressure of perfusate as well as tissue oxygenation were registered. For the measurement of pO(2) values in the perfusate and in different regions of the perfused hind limb, a novel type of microoptode based on quenching of a fluorescent dye was devised. Stable normothermic (37 degrees C) perfusion conditions were maintained at a constant perfusion pressure in the range of 40 - 60 mm Hg by administration of the spasmo lytic <b>moxaverine</b> (0. 5 mg/mL of perfusate as initial dose) at a perfusate flow rate of 0. 5 mL/min for 60 min. At the end of an ILP, there were no signs of tissue damage, neither concerning laboratory data (K(+), myoglobin, creatine kinase, lactic dehydrogenase) nor histopathological criteria. The reported ILP model is not only well suited to investigate the effects of hyperthermia but also to assess the efficacy of new antineoplastic approaches, when nude rats, bearing human tumours in the hind limbs, are used...|$|E
