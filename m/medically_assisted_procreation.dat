40|$|Abstract: This article {{analyses}} {{the current}} situation of <b>medically</b> <b>assisted</b> reproduction in Italy after the issuance of Law 40 in 2004. This law is actually completely different from its first version. In fact, the controversial points, like reproduction for couples with genetic diseases, prohibition of heterologous fertilization, cryoconservation of embryos, obligation to perform just one and simultaneous implant of all the embryos produced, are definitively not in force today. This new situation can be explained not only by rules issued by Italian courts but, in particular, by changes introduced by the European Court of Human Rights and by questions of constitutional legitimacy raised by some Italian Courts. After ten years from the issue of this law, Italy {{has returned to the}} pre-existing situation. The old law was only full of prohibitions. Now, heterologous fertilization is possible and this article gives a picture of the present situation in hospitals for <b>assisted</b> <b>procreation</b> in Italy...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{incremental}} effects of <b>medically</b> <b>assisted</b> detoxification on outpatient treatment for alcohol use disorders. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare drinking outcomes in a psychosocial treatment program between two groups of heavy drinking patients who had an alcohol use disorder: (a) one group with initial <b>medically</b> <b>assisted</b> detoxification and (b) a second group without initial <b>medically</b> <b>assisted</b> detoxification. Analyses were conducted on 262 patients with a more severe alcohol use disorder who completed both an intake assessment and a 9 -month follow-up assessment. The effect of <b>medically</b> <b>assisted</b> detoxification was determined using logistic regression analysis with a propensity score to control for possible baseline differences between the two groups. Of the 262 patients, 82 (31. 3 %) received <b>medically</b> <b>assisted</b> detoxification. These patients were more likely to abstain from alcohol than those without <b>medically</b> <b>assisted</b> detoxification.

This law is actually completely different from the origin version. The controversial points like reproduction for couples who bear genetic diseases, prohibition of heterologous fertilization, cryoconservation of the embryos, obligation to perform just one and contemporaneous implant of all the embryos produced, are today definitively erased. This new situation is due to the jurisprudence of the Italian Courts but especially to the changes introduced by the European Court of Human Rights and by the questions of constitutionality raised by some Italian Courts. After analysis of the legislation, the views of various authors are compared, and the weaknesses and strong points of the law are considered {{from the point of view}} of legal medicine, science and bioethics. After ten years of operation of this law Italy has returned to a situation that existed before the law. In fact the old law was only full of prohibitions. Now is possible to do heterologous fertilization and this article photographs the current situation of hospitals for <b>assisted</b> <b>procreation</b> in Italy. The work also comments on procreative tourism, a direct consequence of this law, and on the status of women, who must be the subject and not the object of the legislation.

40|$|In 2005, Serbia {{enacted a}} new Family Act, {{which is also}} applied in Vojvodina Regarding family planning, the Family Act has {{introduced}} a reform of the provisions on parentage in cases of <b>medically</b> <b>assisted</b> conception. Regarding motherhood, the basic rule is that the mother {{is considered to be}} the woman that gave birth to the child, regardless of whether she is the genetic mother or whether the genetic material of another woman has been used. As for fatherhood, the basic rule is that the father is considered to be the husband or cohabiting partner of the mother, if he has given his written consent to artificial insemination. This rule applies both in cases of AIH (artificial insemination with husband/cohabiting partner sperm) and AID (artificial insemination with donor sperm). This paper deals with the issue of surrogate motherhood in European countries, as well. The regulation of the Family Act on parentage in cases of <b>medically</b> <b>assisted</b> conception presupposes the application of certain techniques of medical conception. These are the donation of the egg cell, embryo, AIH and AID. Furthermore, this regulation stipulates that subjects of <b>medically</b> <b>assisted</b> conception can be, besides spouses, heterosexual cohabiting partners. These issues, however, should be addressed by another law that would fully govern the area of <b>medically</b> <b>assisted</b> conception.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the risk of}} transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) via semen in assisted reproduction techniques, semen samples from 32 men chronically infected with HCV attending a center for <b>assisted</b> <b>procreation</b> were tested for HCV RNA by a reverse transcription-PCR protocol by using {{a modified version of}} the Cobas AMPLICOR HCV assay (version 2. 0; Roche Diagnostics). The sensitivity of the test was 40 copies/ml. Four of 32 seminal plasma samples (12. 5 %) were found to be positive for the presence of HCV RNA. The median HCV load in blood was significantly higher in patients who were found to be positive for the presence of HCV RNA in semen than in those who tested negative (P = 0. 02). In one man, seven consecutive seminal plasma samples tested positive for HCV RNA, as did two consecutive motile spermatozoon fractions; the corresponding fractions obtained after migration of the spermatozoa remained negative. Despite the absence of the proven infectivity of virus in semen samples that test positive for HCV RNA, these findings highlight the fact that seminal fluid may exhibit prolonged HCV RNA excretion. The usefulness of HCV RNA detection in both seminal plasma and spermatozoon fractions before the start of a program of <b>medically</b> <b>assisted</b> reproduction in couples in whom the male partner is chronically infected with HCV would need to be evaluated prospectively with a larger population of subjects exhibiting HCV RNA in their semen...|$|R

Four women were encountered and asked to tell about how they went through that experience. The methodology is qualitative and includes a semi-structured interview rounded off by two genograms. The main results concerning the surrogate mothers' motivations are reported.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was an {{exploratory}} research {{about the quality of the}} triadic family interactions across homo-parental families, in which the parental couple is composed by two women. The objectives have been: a) to investigate the quality of the triadic interactions of lesbo-parental families, by identifying specificity stings of strength and/or weakness; b) to compare the quality of lesbian headed families interactions with the data emerged by the literature on the triadic interactions in “traditional families” (Favez, Lavanchy Scaiola, Tissot, Darwiche, Frascarolo, 2010). Method: 10 lesbian headed families procreating through <b>medically</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>procreation</b> (IVF) have participated belonging to a not clinic population and recruit through associations and web sites devoted to homosexual couples and homo-parental families. The quality of the triadic interactions has been valued through the Lausanne Trilogue Play (LTP; Fivaz-Depeursinge e Corboz-Warnery, 1999). The biological mothers have a mean of 34. 4 years (SD = 5. 85), not biological mothers have a mean of 36. 6 years (SD = 7. 69), and children have a middle age of 28. 3 months (SD = 22. 08). No significant differences was found on T-test analysis about children ages. Results: The collected data show good reliability of the LTP coding to discriminate the quality of the family interactions in comparison to different typologies of families. The comparison among the lesbian headed families group with the data of the research of Favez et al. (2010) on three groups of families (hetero-parents, with depressed mother, hetero-parents recurrent to <b>Medically</b> <b>Assisted</b> <b>Procreation)</b> has shown only meaningful differences with the clinical group. Conclusions: The emerged data seem to underline that the quality of the family triadic interactions is not influenced by the composition of the family. The LTP procedure is able to discriminate the different interactive base typologies of families, with particular reference to those in which a parent manifests clinical symptoms. Otherwise the lesbian headed families appear characterized by a level of triadic iteration closer to hetero-parental families. The present study refers to a different legislative reality from the Italian; we hope that more research can also be developed in the Italian context stimulating the attention of the researchers.
