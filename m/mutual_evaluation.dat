It helps to identify deficiencies in national anti-corruption policies, with a view to prompting the necessary legislative, institutional and practical reforms. GRECO does not have a mandate to measure the occurrence of corrupt practices in its individual member States. Other organisations/bodies are better equipped to deal with this important matter. A widely known example is Transparency International (TI), which issues annually a Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) - ranking more than 150 countries according to perceived levels of corruption, as determined by expert assessments and opinion surveys.|$|E
40|$|We {{interpret}} the TV-show Come Dine with Me as a simultaneous non-cooperative game with evaluation levels as strategic variables, {{and show that}} it belongs to a class of strategic games which we label <b>mutual</b> <b>evaluations</b> games (MEG). Any MEG possesses a zero equilibrium - i. e. a Nash equilibrium where all players evaluate each other with the lowest available scores - as well as numberless non-zero equilibria. Since the former is an equilibrium in weakly dominant strategies, it may arguably {{be regarded as a}} focal point. Yet, in 212 rounds of the German format of Come Dine with Me contestants never got to this focal point, nor did they (with one exception) play any other equilibrium. We provide potential explanations for this off-equilibrium behaviour by considering the impact of social pressure and reputation mechanisms, bandwagon effects, inequality aversion and sequential voting effects...|$|R
30|$|The {{second problem}} is that {{self-evaluation}} may threaten the collectivity of the practices. Since self-evaluation is subjective by nature, child care and education practices based on the collectively-devised plans of child care and education should be evaluated by group discussions. What makes the practices complicated {{is that they are}} inseparable from teachers’ views on children and teaching methodology, and often depends on the overall conditions for child care and education, a hardware-sided issue. Also, the practices reflect children’s home environments as well as the human relationships around them, including the level of trust between their parents and teachers. For these reasons, problems should be addressed in a more comprehensive manner. If problems are left unresolved and no clear solution is suggested, self-evaluations can never be constructive. In this sense, <b>mutual</b> <b>evaluations</b> or evaluations that involve group discussions seem more appropriate than individual self-evaluations. As mentioned above, therefore, there are two major problems of self-evaluation. Accordingly, more in-depth discussions on self-evaluation are required.|$|R
40|$|Suspicious {{transaction}} reporting (STR) is {{a cornerstone of}} the international Anti-Money Laundering/Combatting the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework. The evaluation of AML/CFT regimes is challenging, however, as the quality of STRs varies substantially between countries and {{little is known about}} the factors that drive STR. In combining legal and economic analyses, this article evaluates various factors that potentially explain STR levels. The analysis of the AML/CFT legislation in nine jurisdictions reveals that well-established legal and institutional structures promote the effectiveness of STR systems. In particular, the legal analysis shows that the scope of predicate offenses in national criminal law, as well as a penalty regime for non-compliance with the obligations under national AML/CFT legislation, seem to increase the quantity of STRs. Overly strict penalty regimes and insufficient training of entities with reporting obligations, on the other hand, likely stimulate over-reporting. Based on these findings, we econometrically investigate potential determinants of STR levels for 54 countries from 2006 to 2012. We find that high STR numbers indicate high levels of illegal activities such as terrorism and organized crime. Moreover, <b>mutual</b> <b>evaluations</b> of countries' AML/CFT frameworks entail a short-term increase in the number of STRs. (authors' abstract...|$|R

40|$|Both the World Bank and IMF {{have long}} been {{involved}} in international efforts to strengthen financial sector supervision and to promote good governance, which, among other things, both contribute to reducing financial crime and enhance {{the integrity of the}} international financial system. Since 2001, the Bank-Fund involvement in those issues has been intensified, with a sharper focus on both anti-money-laundering (AML) measures and efforts aimed at combating the financing of terrorism (CFT). Both the Bank and the Fund have worked closely with the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), the standard setting body in this area, to develop a methodology for assessing the observance of international standards on the legal, institutional, and operational framework for AML–CFT. 1 The Bank and the Fund conduct assessments of AML–CFT regimes as part of the FSAP assessments and, {{in the case of the}} Fund, as part of OFC assessments. Assessments are also conducted as part of the <b>mutual</b> <b>evaluations</b> for FATF members, which are done by FATF or FATF-style regional bodies (FSRB). 2 The FATF standards draw on and complement a wide range of United Nations (UN) conventions and resolutions that promote international cooperation in preventing and containing drug trafficking, organized crime, corruption, and efforts to finance terrorism. In addition, all financial supervisory standards have core principles to enhance knowyour-customer (KYC) rules, suspicious transactions reporting, and other due diligence requirements that help to support AML–CFT regimes. Box 8. 1 contains an overview of key UN conventions and resolutions that complement FATF standards, and box 8. 2 highlights key aspects of financial sector supervisory standards that support an effective AML–CFT regime.
