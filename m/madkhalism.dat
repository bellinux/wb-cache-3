50|$|<b>Madkhalism</b> is {{a strain}} of Islamist thought within the larger Salafist {{movement}} based on the writings of Rabee al-Madkhali. Arab states have generally favored <b>Madkhalism</b> due to its support for secular forms of government as opposed to other strains of Salafism, and Madkhalism's decline in Saudi Arabia has been connected with a decline in support for secular forms of government in the Muslim world.|$|E
50|$|Rabee' Ibn Haadee 'Umayr al-Madkhalee (ربيع بن هادي عمير المدخلي) is {{a former}} head of the Sunnah Studies Department at the Islamic University of Madinah. He is a Salafist Muslim scholar, founder of the <b>Madkhalism</b> {{movement}} and is considered one of Salafism's most radical thinkers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Madkhalism</b> {{is often}} {{compared}} to Wahhabism, sharing {{a number of}} tenents with the wider movement. Media analysts have warned against generalizing such Islamists movements despite their differences, however. Madkhali has borrowed heavily from elder Salafist scholar Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani; Madkhali adopted more extreme positions than Albani in his teaching, however, and Madkhalists were dismayed when Albani praised hardline clerics Safar Al-Hawali and Salman al-Ouda.|$|E
50|$|They never oppose rulers. <b>Madkhalism,</b> as an example, is {{a strain}} of Salafists viewed as {{supportive}} of authoritarian regimes in the Middle East. Taking {{its name from the}} controversial Saudi Arabian cleric Rabee al-Madkhali, the movement lost its support in Saudi Arabia proper when several members of the Permanent Committee (the country's clerical body) denounced Madkhali personally. Influence of both the movement and its figureheads have waned so much within the Muslim world that analysts have declared it to be a largely European phenomenon.|$|E
50|$|The polemics of the Madkhalists are {{markedly}} {{different from other}} Salafist groups as well. A noted feature of <b>Madkhalism</b> during Muslim dogmatic exchanges is attacking the opponent instead of discourse regarding the actual topic of discussion. The person of the movement's leader, Rabee al-Madkhali, also carries a heavy focus uncharacteristic of rival movements such as Qutbism. Madkhalists {{have been described as}} obsessed with defense of the movement's leader, often dramatising or exaggerating praise given by Salafist scholars and attempting to stifle or intimidate Salafists with opposing views to those of Madkhali and Madkhalists. A common mantra promoted by Madkhali is that questioning the movement's clerics is forbidden as a general rule, and only allowed in cases of necessity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{movement}} has, in essence, been {{a reaction}} against the Muslim Brotherhood, rival Sahwa movement {{as well as the}} Qutbi movement; Sayyid Qutb, that movement's figurehead, is considered to be an apostate by Madkhali and his movement. At the Madkhalist movement's inception in the early 1990s, the governments of Saudi Arabia and Egypt promoted the group as a counterbalance to more extreme elements of the wider Islamist movement. During this time, a number of radical Jihadists converted to <b>Madkhalism,</b> especially in the Salafist stronghold of Buraidah. In Kuwait, the Madkhali movement was nurtured around individuals who would separate from [...] "mainstream" [...] Salafism in 1981 due to many amongst them entering into political arena [...]|$|E
5000|$|Though often lumped {{together}} {{with all other}} Salafists and Islamists, the Madkhalists have been noted for their opposition to and mutual rivalry with Salafist jihadism. The Madkhalist movement {{has been described as}} politically quietist, eschewing the organized political efforts of the mainstream of Salafism and even going as far as to declare those who participate in modern political system to be heretics or even apostates. Such politically active Salafists are often described by followers of <b>Madkhalism</b> as part of an international conspiracy against [...] "true Salafism." [...] On the other hand, Western intelligence agencies have identified Madkhalists as a group which can be supported and funded discreetly by the US, in comparison {{to the rest of the}} groups seen under the wider Salafi movement.|$|E
