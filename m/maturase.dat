Coordinate structural and functional relationships between HydF and the two other <b>maturases</b> are crucial for the H-cluster assembly. However, to date only qualitative analysis of this protein network have been provided. In this work we showed that the interactions of HydE and HydG with HydF are distinct events, likely occurring in a precise functional order driven by different kinetic properties, independently of the HydF GTPase activity, which is instead involved in the dissociation of the <b>maturases</b> from the scaffold. We also found that HydF is able {{to interact with the}} hydrogenase only when co-expressed with the two other <b>maturases,</b> indicating that under these conditions it harbours per se all the structural elements needed to transfer the H-cluster precursor, thus completing the maturation process.

Genes encoding homologous <b>maturases</b> {{had been found in}} the genomes of all eubacteria that contain Fe-hydrogenase genes but not yet in any other eukaryote. By means of proteomic analysis, we identified a homologue of HydG in the hydrogenosomes, mitochondrion-related organelles that produce hydrogen under anaerobiosis by the activity of Fe-hydrogenase, in the pathogenic protist Trichomonas vaginalis. Genes encoding two other components of the Hyd system, HydE and HydF, were found in the T. vaginalis genome database. Overexpression of HydG, HydE, and HydF in trichomonads showed that all three proteins are specifically targeted to the hydrogenosomes, the site of Fe-hydrogenase maturation. The results of Neighbor-Net analyses of sequence similarities are consistent with a common eubacterial ancestor of HydG, HydE, and HydF in T. vaginalis and C. reinhardtii, supporting a monophyletic origin of Fe-hydrogenase <b>maturases</b> in the two eu-karyotes. Although Fe-hydrogenases exist in only a few eukaryotes, related Narf proteins with different cellular functions are widely distributed.

40|$|The {{chloroplast}} genome of Euglena gracilis contains {{at least}} 155 introns, accounting for 39. 2 % of the genome. Among them are 88 group II introns of size 277 - 671 nucleotide (nt). Questions about {{the processing of}} these introns and their origin and spread in Euglena genera {{is the subject of}} this thesis. My working hypothesis is that the Euglena chloroplast genome evolved from an intron less ancestral genome by the invasion of mobile genetic elements relying in part on internally encoded enzyme activities for mobility. These internal enzymes may also be group II <b>maturases.</b> My research target was the largest intron in Euglena gracilis chloroplast, psbC intron 2 (4144 nt). I characterized psbC intron 2 as a cis-spliced group II intron encoding a 758 codon maturase-like protein (mat 2) that is interrupted by three additional group II introns. I also identified a putative RNA-binding domain (X), that relates to fungal mitochondrial group II intron <b>maturases,</b> and a reverse transcriptase (RT) domain, that has been found in other group II intron <b>maturases</b> and has been shown to have intron-translocation activity (Lazowska, 1994, Moran, 1995). In order to examine the distribution of mat 2, I characterized psbC intron 2 homologues from several species. I found that the mat 2 locus well conserved in most of the Euglena species tested, indicative of a deep root and important function of mat 2. Interestingly, the entire intron is absent in E. myxocylindracea. In order to investigate the effect of mat 2 loss, I analyzed group II intron content in E. myxocylindracea chloroplast genome. No group II introns have been identified in the genome. These data also provided evidence that mat 2 might be responsible for the acquisition and the processing of most of the group II introns in Euglena chloroplast. The activity of the mat 2 protein has been difficult to examine since the protein is hard to obtain.

50|$|Catamixis baccharoides was {{described}} by Thomas Thomson jr. in 1867, who thought it was most closely related to Leucomeris, a genus that is now assigned to the subfamily Wunderlichioideae, tribe Hyalideae. There are no synonyms. It {{has been difficult to}} establish the relationships of Catamixis with other asterids, since no substantial analysis of its genetic material has been published sofar. Because it shares the combination of ligulate florets, spurred anthers, and involucres that consist of several whorls of overlapping bracts, the species was initially assigned to the tribe Mutisieae sensu lato, but genetic analysis has since shown that this grouping constitutes a basal evolutionary grade, which has been consequently divided into nine subfamilies. However, further characters of Catamixis are shared with different of these subfamilies or the subdivisions they include, but always elements of the unique character combinations of these subfamilies are lacking in Catamixis. More recently, Catamixis was assumed {{to be associated with the}} tribe Pertyeae. Catamixis lacks a deletion of 17 base pairs close to one of the chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase genes, that is a common character for members of the subfamilies Gymnarrhenoideae, Cichorioideae, Corymbioideae and Asteroideae. Catamixis, Pertya, Myripnois and two of the Ainsliaea-species share a deletion of 145 base pairs not found in any lineage except Pertyoideae. A point mutation in the <b>maturase</b> K gene is shared with the genera Ainsliaea and Pertya, which belong to the Pertyoideae. This makes it very likely that Catamixis should be included in the Pertyoideae, but does not fully resolve the position within that subfamily.|$|E

The hybrid <b>maturase</b> is an in-frame fusion between the N-terminal half of the <b>maturase</b> encoded by intron 1 of the COXI (cytochrome oxidase) gene and the C-terminal half of a similar <b>maturase</b> encoded by COXI intron 2. pMIT transformants can provide a functional <b>maturase</b> in crosses to restore respiration and COXI polypeptide synthesis to a respiratory-deficient strain defective in the synthesis of a <b>maturase</b> encoded by COXI intron 1; the transformant will also restore respiration to two splicing-defective cis mutants of COXI introns 1 and 3. We detect a 68 -kDa polypeptide comparable in abundance to other major mitochondrial translation products as a likely product of the hybrid <b>maturase</b> gene. Transformants containing an internal 218 -amino acid deletion mutation of the hybrid <b>maturase</b> gene no longer express a functional <b>maturase</b> in crosses and produce the expected shortened polypeptide of approximately 40 kDa; however, those transformants still restore respiration to the COXI cis mutants.

40|$|International audienceThe {{synthesis}} {{and assembly}} of the active site [FeFe] unit of [FeFe]-hydrogenases require at least three <b>maturases.</b> The radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine HydG, the best characterized of these proteins, {{is responsible for the}} synthesis of the hydrogenase CO and CN(-) ligands from tyrosine-derived dehydroglycine (DHG). We speculated that CN(-) and the CO precursor (-) :CO 2 H may be generated through an elimination reaction. We tested this hypothesis with both wild type and HydG variants defective in second iron-sulfur cluster coordination by measuring the in vitro production of CO, CN(-), and (-) :CO 2 H-derived formate. We indeed observed formate production under these conditions. We conclude that HydG is a multifunctional enzyme that produces DHG, CN(-), and CO at three well-differentiated catalytic sites.

40|$|The intron-encoded {{proteins}} bI 4 RNA <b>maturase</b> and aI 4 DNA endonuclease can be faithfully {{expressed in}} yeast cytoplasm from engineered forms of their mitochondrial coding sequences. In this work we studied {{the relationships between}} these two activities associated with two homologous intron-encoded proteins: the bI 4 RNA <b>maturase</b> encoded in the fourth intron of the cytochrome b gene and the aI 4 DNA endonuclease (I-SceII) encoded in the fourth intron of the gene coding for the subunit I of cytochrome oxidase. Taking advantage of both the high recombinogenic properties of yeast and {{the similarities between the}} two genes, we constructed in vivo a family of hybrid genes carrying parts of both RNA <b>maturase</b> and DNA endonuclease coding sequences. The presence of a sequence coding for a mitochondrial targeting peptide upstream from these hybrid genes allowed us to study the properties of their translation products within the mitochondria in vivo. We thus could analyze the ability of the recombinant proteins to complement RNA <b>maturase</b> deficiencies in different strains. Many combinations of the two parental intronic sequences were found in the recombinants. Their structural and functional analysis revealed the following features. (i) The N-terminal half of the bI 4 RNA <b>maturase</b> could be replaced in total by its equivalent from the aI 4 DNA endonuclease without affecting the RNA <b>maturase</b> activity. In contrast, replacing the C-terminal half of the bI 4 RNA <b>maturase</b> with its equivalent from the aI 4 DNA endonuclease led to a very weak RNA <b>maturase</b> activity, indicating that this region is more differentiated and linked to the <b>maturase</b> activity. (ii) None of the hybrid proteins carrying an RNA <b>maturase</b> activity kept the DNA endonuclease activity, suggesting that the latter requires the integrity of the aI 4 protein. These observations are interesting because the aI 4 DNA endonuclease is known to promote the propagation, at the DNA level, of the aI 4 intron, whereas the bI 4 RNA <b>maturase,</b> which is required for the splicing of its coding intron, also controls the splicing process of the aI 4 intron. We propose a scenario for the evolution of these intronic proteins that relies on a switch from DNA endonuclease to RNA <b>maturase</b> activity...|$|E
40|$|Ccm 1 p is a nuclear-encoded PPR (pentatricopeptide repeat) {{protein that}} localizes into {{mitochondria}} of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It was first {{defined as an}} essential factor to remove the bI 4 [COB (cytochrome b) fourth intron) ] and aI 4 [COX 1 (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1) fourth intron] of pre-mRNAs, along with bI 4 <b>maturase,</b> a protein encoded by part of bI 4 and preceding exons that removes the intronic RNA sequence that codes for it. Later on, Ccm 1 p was described as key to maintain the steady-state levels of the mitoribosome small subunit RNA (15 S rRNA). bI 4 <b>maturase</b> is produced inside the mitochondria and therefore its activity depends on the functionality of mitochondrial translation. This report addresses the dilemma of whether Ccm 1 p supports bI 4 <b>maturase</b> activity by keeping steady-state levels of 15 S rRNA or separately and directly supports bI 4 <b>maturase</b> activity per se. Experiments involving loss of Ccm 1 p, SMDC (sudden mitochondrial deprivation of Ccm 1 p) and mutations {{in one of the}} PPR (pentatricopeptide repeat) motifs revealed that the failure of bI 4 <b>maturase</b> activity in CCM 1 deletion mutants was not due to a malfunction of the translational machinery. Both functions were found to be independent, defining Ccm 1 p as a moonlighting protein. bI 4 <b>maturase</b> activity was significantly more dependent on Ccm 1 p levels than the maintenance of 15 S rRNA. The novel strategy of SMDC described here allowed the study of immediate short-term effects, before the mutant phenotype was definitively established. This approach can be also applied for further studies on 15 S rRNA stability and mitoribosome assembly...|$|E
40|$|The {{imported}} mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase (NAM 2 p) and a mitochondrial-expressed intron-encoded <b>maturase</b> protein {{are required}} for splicing the fourth intron (bI 4) of the yeast cob gene, which expresses an electron transfer protein that is essential to respiration. However, {{the role of the}} tRNA synthetase, as well as the function of the bI 4 <b>maturase,</b> remain unclear. As a first step towards elucidating the mechanistic role of these protein splicing factors in this group I intron splicing reaction, we tested the hypothesis that both leucyl-tRNA synthetase and bI 4 <b>maturase</b> interact directly with the bI 4 intron. We developed a yeast three-hybrid system and determined that both the tRNA synthetase and bI 4 <b>maturase</b> can bind directly and independently via RNA-protein interactions to the large bI 4 group I intron. We also showed, using modified two-hybrid and three-hybrid assays, that the bI 4 intron bridges interactions between the two protein splicing partners. In the presence of either the bI 4 <b>maturase</b> or the Leu-tRNA synthetase, bI 4 intron transcribed recombinantly with flanking exons in the yeast nucleus exhibited splicing activity. These data combined with previous genetic results are consistent with a novel model for a ternary splicing complex (two protein: one RNA) in which both protein splicing partners bind directly to the bI 4 intron and facilitate its self-splicing activity...|$|E

The synthesis of mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CoxI) and cytochrome b (Cob) is impaired in pim 1 mutants containing mtDNA.

Modelling of the derived RNA secondary structure reveals the presence of perfectly conserved domains V and VI as typical features of group II introns. An intron internal reading frame upstream of domain V is homologous to group II intron encoded <b>maturases.</b> A reading frame downstream of the predicted 3 '-splice site is highly similar to a small polypeptide encoded in {{the central part of the}} Agrobacterium tumefaciens T-DNA.

To investigate more directly the biosynthesis of mRNA <b>maturase</b> we raised antibodies against {{a part of the}} putative ORF translation product.

In the case of liverwort species from the genus Porella and mosses from the genus Plagiomnium, the <b>maturase</b> coding gene (matK) represents a truncated form of other plant matK genes: several subdomains of the reverse transcriptase-like domain and so-called domain X are not present in these ORFs. These ORFs probably represent pseudogenes of the matK gene. The analysis of codon usage within the matK gene revealed the presence of strong A/T pressure. The use of codons with the third letter being U or A varies from 71 - 93 %. The comparison of <b>maturase</b> amino acid sequences at the family level shows a high identity between species.

Entry into (invasion) and exit from (egress) these cells requires an array of specialized parasite molecules, many of which have long been considered to have potential as targets of drug or vaccine-based therapies. In this chapter the authors discuss the current state of knowledge regarding the role of parasite proteolytic enzymes in these critical steps in the life cycle of two clinically important apicomplexan genera, Plasmodium and Toxoplasma. At least three distinct proteases of the cysteine mechanistic class have been implicated in egress of the malaria parasite from cells of its vertebrate and insect host. In contrast, the bulk of the evidence indicates a prime role for serine proteases of the subtilisin and rhomboid families in invasion by both parasites.

Results are based on Northern blot analyses which show that in cbp 7 mutants with the short cytochrome b gene the <b>maturase</b> encoding intervening sequence fails to be excised although, at the same time, at least wild-type levels of the <b>maturase</b> are present as indicated by antibodies specific to it in Western blot analyses...|$|E
40|$|Background: [FeFe] hydrogenases are metalloenzymes {{involved}} in the anaerobic metabolism of H 2. These proteins are distinguished by an active site cofactor known as the H-cluster. This unique [6 Fe– 6 S] complex contains multiple non-protein moieties and requires several maturation enzymes for its assembly. The pathways and biochemical precursors for H-cluster biosynthesis {{have yet to be}} elucidated. Principal Findings: We report an in vitro maturation system in which, for the first time, chemical additives enhance [FeFe] hydrogenase activation, thus signifying in situ H-cluster biosynthesis. The maturation system is comprised of purified hydrogenase apoprotein; a dialyzed Escherichia coli cell lysate containing heterologous HydE, HydF, and HydG maturases; and exogenous small molecules. Following anaerobic incubation of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii HydA 1 apohydrogenase with S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), cysteine, tyrosine, iron, sulfide, and the non-purified <b>maturases,</b> hydrogenase activity increased 5 -fold relative to incubations without the exogenous substrates. No conditions were identified in which addition of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) improved hydrogenase maturation. Significance: The in vitro system allows for direct investigation of [FeFe] hydrogenase activation. This work also provides a foundation for studying the biosynthetic mechanisms of H-cluster biosynthesis using solely purified enzymes and chemical additives...|$|R
30|$|Fungal mtDNA introns {{tend to be}} self-splicing {{elements}} that can catalyze their own excision from transcripts and depending on the excision mechanism, they have been divided into group I and group II introns (Saldanha et al. 1993; Lambowitz et al. 1999). Splicing of groups I (GI) and II (GII) introns tend to be facilitated {{by a combination of}} intron-encoded (<b>maturases)</b> or host genome-encoded factors (Lang et al. 2007; Hausner 2012). Some of these introns have the potential to be mobile due to the presence of intron-encoded proteins (IEPs) that promote the movement of their host introns from intron-containing alleles to cognate alleles that lack the intron (Dujon 1989). Homing endonucleases (HEs) are DNA-cutting enzymes encoded by homing endonuclease genes (HEGs) and these are frequently encountered as ORFs within GI introns and in some instances within GII introns (Toor and Zimmerly 2002; reviewed in Hafez and Hausner 2012). HEGs can also be freestanding, encoded within archaeal introns, and comprise the DNA-cutting component of inteins (Gimble 2000; Belfort et al. 2002; Stoddard 2005; Barzel et al. 2011). Currently, at least six families of HEs are recognized. Their naming is based on conserved amino acid motifs: the LAGLIDADG, H–N–H, His-Cys box, PD-(D/E)xK, EDxHD, and GIY-YIG families of HEs (Stoddard 2011, 2014).|$|R
40|$|Naegleria gruberi is a {{free-living}} heterotrophic aerobic amoeba {{well known}} {{for its ability to}} transform from an amoeba to a flagellate form. The genome of N. gruberi has been recently published, and in silico predictions demonstrated that Naegleria has the capacity for both aerobic respiration and anaerobic biochemistry to produce molecular hydrogen in its mitochondria. This finding was considered to have fundamental implications on the evolution of mitochondrial metabolism and of the last eukaryotic common ancestor. However, no actual experimental data have been shown to support this hypothesis. For this reason, we have decided to investigate the anaerobic metabolism of the mitochondrion of N. gruberi. Using in vivo biochemical assays, we have demonstrated that N. gruberi has indeed a functional [FeFe]-hydrogenase, an enzyme that is attributed to anaerobic organisms. Surprisingly, in contrast to the published predictions, we have demonstrated that hydrogenase is localized exclusively in the cytosol, while no hydrogenase activity was associated with mitochondria of the organism. In addition, cytosolic localization displayed for HydE, a marker component of hydrogenase <b>maturases.</b> Naegleria gruberi, an obligate aerobic organism and one of the earliest eukaryotes, is producing hydrogen, a function that raises questions on the purpose of this pathway for the lifestyle of the organism and potentially on the evolution of eukaryotes...|$|R
