25|$|An amateur {{radio station}} {{installed}} in a vehicle {{is referred to as}} a mobile station. A typical mobile station is equipped with a transceiver, one or more antennas, and a microphone. The transceiver may be specially designed for installation in vehicles. It may be much smaller than transceivers designed for fixed station use, to facilitate installation under a seat or in a trunk, and it may feature a detachable control head that can be mounted in a separate location {{from the rest of the}} radio. Antennas designed for <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> must accommodate the unique physical constraints of the vehicle and travel lanes which it occupies, allowing for clearance under overpasses and bridges, and safe passage by vehicles in adjacent lanes. Most antennas used in <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> are omnidirectional. Few <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> are equipped to communicate with Morse code or digital modes. Most <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> are designed to be operated by the vehicle operator while driving.|$|E
25|$|Most {{transceivers}} {{installed in}} vehicles {{are designed to}} run on 12-16 VDC, and are generally powered by the starting battery in the vehicle. Because of the power demands placed on the vehicle battery, most <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> either do not include external amplifiers or include amplifiers with power outputs that are more modest than those commonly found in fixed stations.|$|E
25|$|An amateur {{radio station}} is {{a radio station}} {{designed}} to provide radiocommunications in the amateur radio service for an amateur radio operator. Radio amateurs build and operate several types of amateur radio stations, including fixed ground stations, <b>mobile</b> <b>stations,</b> space stations, and temporary field stations. A slang term often used for an amateur station's location is the shack, named after the small enclosures added to the upperworks of naval ships to hold early radio equipment and batteries.|$|E
5000|$|Internal Roaming: The <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station</b> (MS) {{moves from}} one access point (AP) to another AP within a home network if the signal {{strength}} is too weak. An authentication server (RADIUS) performs the re-authentication of MS via 802.1x (e.g. with PEAP). The billing of QoS {{is in the}} home network. A <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station</b> roaming from one access point to another often interrupts the flow of data among the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station</b> and an application connected to the network. The <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station,</b> for instance, periodically monitors the presence of alternative access points (ones that will provide a better connection). At some point, based on proprietary mechanisms, the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station</b> decides to re-associate with an access point having a stronger wireless signal. The <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station,</b> however, may lose a connection with an access point before associating with another access point. In order to provide reliable connections with applications, the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station</b> must generally include software that provides session persistence.|$|R

25|$|An amateur {{radio station}} {{set up in}} a {{temporary}} location is referred to as a portable station. A portable stations might be established to provide emergency communications in a disaster area, to provide public service communications during a large organized event such as a charity bicycle ride, to provide communications during an expedition, or for the recreational enjoyment of operating outdoors. Portable stations include the same basic equipment as fixed and <b>mobile</b> <b>stations,</b> although transportation of the transceiver, antennas, power supplies or batteries and necessary accessories often influences the particular selection. Equipment that does not weigh very much, or that can be broken down for shipment or transportation in luggage is especially popular with amateur radio operators travelling on DX-peditions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{mobility}} {{management is}} one of the most critical issues in mobile wireless systems. The quest to support delay-stringent multimedia applications challenges most existing solutions to the mobility management problem. We propose a mobility management scheme, called Mobile AP, to support station mobility efficiently. In Mobile AP mobility support system, the context of each <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> is defined by the association states between the <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> and the wireless communication infrastructure. When the <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> roams in <b>Mobile</b> AP systems, the context of the association follows the <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> from one physical access point to another, thus eliminating the need for the <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> to re-associate with new access points.

50|$|The LAI is {{broadcast}} regularly {{through a}} broadcast control channel (BCCH). A <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> (e.g. cell phone) recognizes the LAI and stores {{it in the}} SIM Card. If the <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> is moving and notices a change of LAI, it will issue a location update request, thereby informing the mobile provider of its new LAI. This allows the provider to locate the <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> {{in case of an}} incoming call.|$|R

2500|$|Two of Australia's {{most unusual}} medium wave {{stations}} were <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> 2XT and 3YB. They both operated in eras {{prior to the}} universal establishment of rural radio stations. 2XT was designed and operated by AWA within the State of New South Wales, from a NSW Railways train, between November 1925 and December 1927. 2XT, which stood for experimental train, visited over 100 rural centres. Engineers would set up a transmitting aerial and the station would then begin broadcasting. [...] This led to the further sales of AWA products.|$|E
40|$|Mobile {{communication}} is {{more vulnerable to}} security attacks such as interception and unauthorized access than fixed network communication. To overcome these problems, many protocols have been proposed to provide a secure channel between a <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> and a base station. However, the public-key based protocols are not fully utilized due to the poor computing power and the small battery capacity of a <b>mobile</b> <b>station.</b> In this paper, we propose some techniques accelerating public-key based key establishment protocols between a <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> and a base station. The proposed techniques enable a <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> to borrow computing power from a base station without revealing its secret information. The proposed schemes accelerate the previous protocols up to five times and {{reduce the amount of}} power consumption of a <b>mobile</b> <b>station.</b> The proposed schemes use SASC (Server-Aided Secret Computation) protocols that are used for smart cards.

In Personal AP mobility support system, the mobility context of each <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> {{is defined by the}} relevant state information at the currently associated access point, including the MAC layer association states at the access point.
