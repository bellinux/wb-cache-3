40|$|The {{standards}} and methods concerning assignment of rolling bearing fit with shafts and frames via example of bearing 6 - 208 are analyzed. We set certain differences of recommendations according to GOST 3325 - 85, "Rolling bearings. Tolerance zones and technical requirements to <b>mounting</b> <b>surfaces</b> of shafts and frames. Attachment" and by reference of rolling bearing manufacturers. The following factors {{should be taken}} into consideration when assigning the mounting with the tension the internal ring of the bearing with shaft and mounting with a gap in the outer ring with a housing bore. The methods of achieving accuracy of <b>mounting</b> <b>surfaces</b> of shafts and frames via form tolerance assignment: roundness tolerance, profile of longitudinal cut, cross section, cylindricity and others. It is possible to limit the bearing rings in different ways, for example appointing the cylindrical <b>mounting</b> <b>surfaces</b> and bead end surfaces the appropriate tolerances, namely: coaxiality tolerance or full radial beat of <b>mounting</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and also perpendicularity tolerance, butt beats and full butt beats of <b>mounting</b> end <b>surfaces.</b> We suggest to expand methods of achieving the accuracy of shafts and frames depending on seriation of production and production operations metrology support. ...|$|R
2500|$|Run-out is {{measured}} using {{a dial indicator}} on a fixed rigid base, with the tip perpendicular to the brake disc's face. It is typically measured about [...] from the outside diameter of the disc. The disc is spun. The difference between minimum and maximum value on the dial is called lateral run-out. Typical hub/disc assembly run-out specifications for passenger vehicles are around [...] Runout can be caused either by deformation of the disc itself or by runout in the underlying wheel hub face or by contamination between the disc surface and the underlying hub <b>mounting</b> <b>surface.</b> Determining {{the root cause of}} the indicator displacement (lateral runout) requires disassembly of the disc from the hub. Disc face runout due to hub face runout or contamination will typically have a period of 1 minimum and 1 maximum per revolution of the brake disc.|$|E

50|$|A {{positioning}} goniometer or goniometric {{stage is}} a device used to rotate an object precisely (within a small angular range) about a fixed axis in space. Its appearance {{is similar to}} that of a linear stage. However, rather than moving linearly with respect to its base, the stage platform rotates partially about a fixed axis above the <b>mounting</b> <b>surface</b> of the platform. The distance of the center of rotation from the platform <b>mounting</b> <b>surface</b> is often chosen so that two different goniometer models may be stacked in an X-Y configuration and both stages will rotate about the same point. Positioning goniometers typically use a worm drive with a partial worm wheel fixed to the underside of the stage platform meshing with a worm in the base. The worm may be rotated manually or by a motor as in automated positioning systems.|$|E
