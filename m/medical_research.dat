Between 1947 and 1953, {{he was a member}} of the National Health and <b>Medical</b> <b>Research</b> Council's <b>Medical</b> <b>Research</b> Advisory Committee. The committee advised on funding for <b>medical</b> <b>research</b> in Australia. During this same period (1947–52), he was also a member of the Commonwealth government's Defence Research and Development Policy Committee. Declassified files from this committee show that Burnet made the recommendation that Australia pursue development of chemical and biological weapons to target neighbouring countries' food stocks and spread infectious diseases. His report was titled War from a Biological Angle. Between 1955 and 1959, he was chairman of the Australian Radiation Advisory Committee; he was concerned that Australians were being exposed to unnecessary medical and industrial radiation.|$|E

The volunteers were rewarded with three weeks' leave and a certificate of appreciation signed by General Blamey.

40|$|Many {{undergraduate}} medical programmes now {{require students}} to develop <b>research</b> and <b>medical</b> students are increasingly choosing to undertake medical education projects at undergraduate level. As <b>medical</b> education <b>research</b> often requires different {{ways of thinking about}} knowledge and research compared with biomedical disciplines, undergraduate <b>medical</b> education <b>research</b> can be challenging for students and supervisors alike. This paper aims to address a gap in the literature, by providing recommendations for both students and supervisors involved in undergraduate <b>medical</b> education <b>research.</b> Our practical tips are based upon reflections and insights from an undergraduate student who undertook a <b>medical</b> education <b>research</b> project and an experienced undergraduate research supervisor. The importance of good organisational, time management and communication skills are highlighted. Students should recognise and {{make the most of the}} unique learning opportunities that are present when undertaking a <b>medical</b> education <b>research</b> project and supervisors should be attentive and supportive of their individual students’ needs...|$|R

So, the authors designed a table showing the above mentioned types of influences, for using in ethical assessments of the costs and benefits of <b>medical</b> <b>researches.</b> "nBecause of the complexity that exists in various aspects of the costs and benefits of a research, the researcher can not accomplish this analysis alone. It reveals the philosophy of the composition of the research ethics committees.
