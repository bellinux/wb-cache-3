5|$|Trondheim's first station, {{dating from}} 1864, was located at Kalvskinnet. In 1877 the current station {{was built to}} serve the Meråker Line to Sweden—since {{integrated}} into the Nordland Line. At {{the same time a}} connection was built between the two stations, and the central station took over as the <b>main</b> <b>station</b> serving Trondheim. In 1910 construction of a new station for the Dovre Line was started, finishing in 1921. The <b>main</b> <b>station</b> building consists of an older section in historicism brick, while the annex is in postmodernistic concrete and glass.|$|E

The first GWR service from London to Taplow, near Maidenhead, ran from Paddington in 1838. After the <b>main</b> <b>station</b> opened, this became the site of the goods depot. Brunel did not consider that anything less than a grand terminus dedicated to the GWR would be acceptable, and consequently this was approved in February 1853.|$|E
5|$|The {{north end}} of the station {{features}} a light-red brick and green-roof building that contains space for use by the train and bus operators. The building is postmodern in style and includes rose windows, false chimneys, and gables.

5|$|Although {{it is now}} {{possible}} to reach the station through the Temple Quay office development (on the site of the goods shed) or from the Bristol Ferry Boat Company landing stage on the Floating Harbour, the traditional and main approach is from Temple Gate. Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Tudor-style offices, later used by the former British Empire and Commonwealth Museum, face this road and are flanked on the north side by an archway that used to be the <b>main</b> <b>station</b> for departing passengers; a matching arch on the other side was the arrivals gateway but was removed when the station was expanded in the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, the War Department {{decided to}} {{commission}} the Longmoor Military Railway, which {{ran from the}} Longmoor Camp near Liphook to Bordon.
