40|$|<b>Magnesium</b> hafnium <b>tungstate</b> [MgHf(WO 4) 3] was {{synthesized}} by high-energy {{ball milling}} followed by calcination. The material {{was characterized by}} variable-temperature neutron and x-ray difftaction. It crystallized in space group P 21 /a below 400 K and transformed to an orthorhombic structure at higher temperatures. The orthorhombic polymorph adopted space group Pnma, instead of the Pnca structure commonly observed for other A 2 (MO 4) 3 materials (A = trivalent metal, M = Mo, W). In contrast, the monoclinic polymorphs appeared to be isostructural. Negative thermal expansion was observed in the orthorhombic phase with Î±a = - 5. 2 Ã� 10 - 6 K- 1, Î±b = 4. 4 Ã� 10 - 6 K- 1, Î±c = - 2. 9 Ã� 10 - 6 K- 1, Î±V = - 3. 7 Ã� 10 - 6 K- 1, and Î± 1, = - 1. 2 Ã� 10 - 6 K- 1.

A high-quality crystal has been grown by the top seeded solution growth method. The relevant spectroscopic properties are characterized in terms of absorption, luminescence and Raman spectroscopy. Judd-Ofelt (J-O) analysis is performed to evaluate the spontaneous emission probabilities and the radiative lifetimes. The absorption, stimulated-emission and gain cross-section spectra are determined for the principal light polarizations. The first laser action in the 2 ¿m spectral range is demonstrated in the regime of continuous-wave operation with a maximum output power of 775 mW and a slope efficiency of 39 %...|$|E
40|$|The complex four-component system, {{containing}} barium oxide, magnesium oxide, lead oxide, and silicon dioxide, {{has been}} explored and several new phosphors were discovered which emit blue-white or blue-green light when excited by 2537 ~ radiation.

The first of these is a modified barium mesotrisilicate which emits light much like <b>magnesium</b> <b>tungstate.</b> The second is a complex silicate of variable composition and this fluoresces blue-green. Both com-pounds were previously found in barium-lead silicate phosphors, and the introduction of magnesium ainly improves the efficiency of the fluorescence. Powder patterns obtained by x-ray diffraction indicate that at least four other new complex silicates may exist, but their composition has not been established and the powder patterns themselves are somewhat uncertain because mixtures of two or more components were almost invariably pre~ent...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} powder {{phosphors}} have been {{measured by a}} direct optical method. Results are compared with other publ ished values. Although sl ight discrepancies are found for magnesium and calcium tungstate at the 2537 A position, the maximum quantum efficiency for <b>magnesium</b> <b>tungstate</b> is in good agreement with t e published values. Good agreement is also found for im-pur i ty-act ivated phosphors. New data are presented {{for a number of}} ortho-phosphates. The quantum efficiency curves decrease more rapid ly than the ab-sorption curves toward both longer and shorter wave lengths from the peak position. The peaks of the quantum efficiency curves lie at longer wave lengths than those of the absorption curves. Reasons for these differences are discussed.

40|$|Luminescent {{properties}} of <b>magnesium</b> <b>tungstate</b> monocrystals grown by two different methods are studied. Only the exciton luminescence of these crystals themselves is observed. Temperature {{dependence of the}} low-energy range in the luminescence excitation spectra is described by the Urbach rule. Slope coefficient σ 0 = 0. 74 obtained from this dependence implies autolocalization of the excitons in MgWO$_ 4 $. The processes of electronic excitations relaxation are considered depending {{on the structure of}} valence band in MgWO$_ 4 $ and in other wolframites, ZnWO$_ 4 $ and CdWO$_ 4 $. In contrast to ZnWO$_ 4 $ and CdWO$_ 4 $, the d-states of the cation do not participate in formation of the MgWO$_ 4 $ valence band. Using the excitation spectra measured in the range of the fundamental absorption (4 – 20 eV), it is shown that this difference manifests itself in relaxation of electronic excitations and may be the cause of the relatively low light yield of MgWO$_ 4 $...|$|E
40|$|Raman {{scattering}} {{measurements and}} lattice-dynamics calculations {{have been performed}} on <b>magnesium</b> <b>tungstate</b> under high pressure up to 41 GPa. Experiments {{have been carried out}} under a selection of different pressure-media. The influence of non-hydrostaticity on the structural properties of MgWO 4 and isomorphic compounds is examined. Under quasi-hydrostatic conditions a phase transition has been found at 26 GPa in MgWO 4. The high-pressure phase has been tentatively assigned to a triclinic structure similar to that of CuWO 4. We also report and discuss the Raman symmetries, frequencies, and pressure coefficients in the low- and high-pressure phases. In addition, the Raman frequencies for different wolframites are compared and the variation of the mode frequency with the reduced mass across the family is investigated. Finally, the accuracy of theoretical calculations is systematically discussed for MgWO 4, MnWO 4, FeWO 4, CoWO 4, NiWO 4, ZnWO 4, and CdWO 4. Comment: 36 pages, 9 figures, 4 table...|$|E
40|$|<b>Magnesium</b> <b>tungstate</b> (MgWO 4) {{crystals}} of ~ 1 cm 3 volume {{were obtained}} {{for the first time}} using a flux growth technique. The crystal was subjected to comprehensive characterisation that included room-temperature measurements of the transmittance, X-ray luminescence spectra, afterglow under X-ray excitation, relative photoelectron output, energy resolution, non-proportionality of scintillation response to γ-quanta, response to α-particles, and pulse shape for γ-quanta and α-particles. The light output and decay kinetics of MgWO 4 were studied over the temperature range 7 - 305 K. Under X-ray excitation the crystal exhibits an intense luminescence band peaking at a wavelength of 470 nm; the intensity of afterglow after 20 ms is 0. 035 %. An energy resolution of 9. 1 % for 662 keV γ-quanta of 137 Cs was measured with a small (≈ 0. 9 g) sample of the MgWO 4 crystal. The photoelectron output of the MgWO 4 crystal scintillator is 35 % that of CdWO 4 and 27 % that of NaI(Tl). The detector showed pulse-shape discrimination ability in measurements with α-particles and γ-quanta, which enabled us to assess the radioactive contamination of the scintillator. The results of these studies demonstrate the prospect of this material for a variety of scintillation applications, including rare event searches. © 2008 Elsevier B. V...|$|E
40|$|The {{prospects}} {{for the use of}} molybdates and tungstates in the opto-electronic devises prompted studies of the structure, as well as luminescence and scintillation properties of MgWO 4 -MgMoO 4 system. The powder samples of (1 -x) MgMoO 4 xMgWO 4 (x = 0; 0. 01; 0. 05; 0. 1; 0. 3; 0. 5; 0. 7; 0. 9, and 1. 0) were synthesised by the solid state reaction technique at 900 °C. The results of the X-ray structure analysis identified three types of crystal structure in the pseudo-binary MgWO 4 -MgMoO 4 system, i. e. β-MgMoO 4, cuprosheelite α-MgMoO 4, and wolframite MgWO 4. It is shown that a single-phase solid solution MgMo 1 -xWxO 4 with β-MgMoO 4 structure is formed at x < 0. 10, whereas at higher concentration of tungsten the mixture of different phases is created. The phase composition of the sample determines the luminescence spectra; the maximum of the emission band is observed at 520 nm for β-MgMoO 4, 590 nm for α-MgMoO 4, and 480 nm for MgWO 4. A possible correlation between the emission spectra and peculiarities of crystal structure are discussed in terms of the canonical configuration coordinate model. The emission efficiency of <b>magnesium</b> <b>tungstate</b> is found to be highest within the compounds under investigation. The scintillation light yield of MgWO 4 at T = 295 K is found to be 0. 90 ± 0. 15 of that of ZnWO 4 and remains high with the decrease of temperature...|$|E
40|$|Some recent {{measurements}} {{have been}} made on the quantum efficiency of fluorescent lamp phosphors by the method employed by Thayer and Barnes (1). This method consists of comparing the photo-metered luminous efficiency (lpw) of a lamp to its calculated lpw, assuming 100 per cent quantum efficiency for the powder. This method has not been widely used, possibly {{due to lack of}} understanding of its derivation. Most measurements appearing in the literature are made by irradiating a sample of the powder with a known amount of 253. 7 mu radiation and measuring the amount of radiation emitted by the phosphor (2). This measurement is complicated by the difficulty in measuring the absolute quantity of actinic radiation, and recourse is usually made to assumptions as to the efficiency of some powder chosen as a standard (usually <b>magnesium</b> <b>tungstate</b> = 100 %) and the performance of other phosphors compared thereto. The method used in the present measurements obviates the recourse to a reference standard, and direct comparisons can be made between measure-ments separated by considerable periods of time. Also, since the measurements are made on the phos-phor in its final form as incorporated into the lamp, they furnish information of more interest to the lamp manufacturer. The basic formula for the luminous efficiency of a lamp with 100 per cent quantum efficiency for the phosphor is: A f Ex ~ dX lpw = F ~ + C (I...|$|E
40|$|Numerous organisms produce ornately {{detailed}} inorganic structures (often {{known as}} shells) with features on length scales from 50 nm to several centimeters. One class of such organisms are the diatoms; microscopic algae that form silica frustules. Another group of algae, the coccolithophorids, produce similar calcium carbonate structures. Over 100, 000 species comprise these {{two classes of}} algae, every {{one of which is}} endowed with a unique cytoskeleton structure. Using various types of displacement reactions, the chemistry of the original structure can be modified to produce a new material. Magnesium vapor has been found to displace the silicon in diatom frustules to yield an MgO structure. The conversion has been reported at temperatures from 650 °C to 900 °C. In the current work, the conversion and processing of silica frustules to MgO was examined in depth. The effect of reaction temperature on grain size and extent of conversion was evaluated. With the goal of obtaining high purity MgO structures, various methods for removing the silicon products of reaction were investigated. Wet chemistry and high temperature vapor etches were evaluated. The MgO reaction served as an intermediate step in the production of <b>magnesium</b> <b>tungstate</b> diatoms, which were imbued with photoluminescent properties. Reactions were identified to allow the conversion of calcium carbonate (calcite) structures to alternative chemistries. Calcite sand-dollars were converted to calcium tungstate or calcium molybdate by aqueous solution chemistry. In this process, sand dollar tests (shells) and coccolithophore frustules were reacted with ammonium para-molybdate or ammonium para-tungstate. The reactions were evaluated for shape preservation, phase purity, and photoluminescence of the structures. M. S.
