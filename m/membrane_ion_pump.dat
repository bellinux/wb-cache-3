40|$|Ferulic acid (FA) is the {{ubiquitous}} phytochemical phenolic derivative of cinnamic acid. Experimental studies in diabetic models demonstrate that FA possesses multiple mechanisms of action associated with anti-hyperglycemic activity. The {{mechanism by which}} FA prevents diabetes-associated vascular damages remains unknown. The aim of {{study was to investigate}} the protective effects of FA on protein glycation, lipid peroxidation, <b>membrane</b> <b>ion</b> <b>pump</b> activity, and phosphatidylserine exposure in high glucose-exposed human erythrocytes. Our results demonstrated that FA (10 - 100 μM) significantly reduced the levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) whereas 0. 1 - 100 μM concentrations inhibited lipid peroxidation in erythrocytes exposed to 45 mM glucose. This was associated with increased glucose consumption. High glucose treatment also caused a significant reduction in Na+/K+-ATPase activity in the erythrocyte plasma membrane which could be reversed by FA. Furthermore, we found that FA (0. 1 - 100 μM) prevented high glucose-induced phosphatidylserine exposure. These findings provide insights into a novel mechanism of FA for the prevention of vascular dysfunction associated with diabetes...|$|E
40|$|The Na+/K+-ATPase is a {{ubiquitous}} plasma <b>membrane</b> <b>ion</b> <b>pump</b> that utilizes ATP hydrolysis {{to regulate}} the intracellular concentration of Na+ and K+. It is comprised {{of at least two}} subunits, a large catalytic α subunit that mediates ATP hydrolysis and ion transport, and an ancillary β subunit that is required for proper trafficking of the holoenzyme. Although processes mediated by the α subunit have been extensively studied, {{little is known about the}} participation of the β subunit in conformational changes of the enzyme. To elucidate the role of the β subunit during ion transport, extracellular amino acids proximal to the transmembrane region of the sheep β 1 subunit were individually replaced for cysteines. This enabled sulfhydryl-specific labeling with the environmentally sensitive fluorescent dye tetramethylrhodamine- 6 -maleimide (TMRM) upon expression in Xenopus oocytes. Investigation by voltage-clamp fluorometry identified three reporter positions on the β 1 subunit that responded with fluorescence changes to alterations in ionic conditions and/or membrane potential. These experiments for the first time show real-time detection of conformational rearrangements of the Na+/K+-ATPase through a fluorophore-labeled β subunit. Simultaneous recording of presteady-state or stationary currents together with fluorescence signals enabled correlation of the observed environmental changes of the β subunit to certain reaction steps of the Na+/K+-ATPase, which involve changes in the occupancy of the two principle conformational states, E 1 P and E 2 P. From these experiments, evidence is provided that the β 1 -S 62 C mutant can be directly used to monitor the conformational state of the enzyme, while the F 64 C mutant reveals a relaxation process that is triggered by sodium transport but evolves on a much slower time scale. Finally, shifts in voltage dependence and kinetics observed for mutant K 65 C show that this charged lysine residue, which is conserved in β 1 isoforms, directly influences the effective potential that determines voltage dependence of extracellular cation binding and release...|$|E
40|$|Cerebral {{perfusion}} is {{the basis}} for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the brain. Brain tissue can become damaged when there is a shortage in the blood supply. Basic physiological functions such as synaptic transmission, the <b>membrane</b> <b>ion</b> <b>pump</b> and energy metabolism are disrupted and within minutes can lead to irreversible damage and neurological symptoms. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the ability of arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI to measure cerebral perfusion in patients with acute stroke and symptomatic large vessel disease of the brain feeding arteries. ASL perfusion imaging is an alternative non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique for visualizing brain perfusion and quantifying cerebral blood flow that does not require injection of contrast agents. The blood flowing into the brain is used as an endogenous contrast agent by magnetically labeling the inflowing blood with radiofrequency pulses. This thesis consists of two parts. The first part focuses on the application of different ASL-MRI techniques to assess brain perfusion. In patients with acute stroke it is shown that ASL can detect perfusion deficits and perfusion-diffusion mismatch prior to treatment comparable to gadolinium based DSC perfusion imaging (chapter 2). By acquiring a series of perfusion-weighted images at increasing delay times after the initial labeling, ASL is able to measure the inflow of blood into the brain. Although, when compared to H 215 O PET there was a relative systematic overestimation of cerebral blood flow (chapter 3), ASL can depict the presence and extent of regions with hypoperfusion and increased transit times in patients with carotid artery disease (chapter 4 and 5). The second part of this thesis focuses on assessing the cerebrovascular reactivity by combining ASL perfusion imaging with a vascular challenge. This {{is a measure of the}} brain’s capacity to sustain blood flow when perfusion pressure drops. Impairment is associated with increased stroke occurrence. Cerebrovascular reactivity is impaired in patients with a carotid artery stenosis on the side of the stenosis (chapter 6). By using a selective ASL technique that can visualize the flow territories of the brain feeding arteries, it was shown that cerebrovascular reactivity impairment varies throughout the brain (chapter 7). Tissue areas fed via collaterals are the most impaired. Both large vessel disease and the occurrence of white matter lesions were furthermore found to have an effect upon white matter hemodynamics (chapter 8). ASL perfusion imaging can be used to visualize the cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity. It can be used in both patients with acute stroke and large vessel disease to detect impaired hemodynamics and be used to assess a patient’s risk for future stroke. In the future, ASL may potentially be used to customize medicinal and surgical treatment to individual patient need...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{ability of}} {{isolated}} brain mitochondria to accumulate, store and release calcium {{has been extensively}} characterized. Extrapolation to the intact neuron led to predictions that the in situ mitochondria would reversibly accumulate Ca 2 + when the concentration of the cation {{in the vicinity of}} the mitochondria rose above the ‘set-point’ at which uptake and efflux were in balance, storing Ca 2 + as a complex with phosphate, and slowly releasing the cation when plasma <b>membrane</b> <b>ion</b> <b>pumps</b> lowered the cytoplasmic free Ca 2 +. Excessive accumulation of the cation was predicted to lead to activation of the permeability transition, with catastrophic consequences for the neuron.

30|$|Although diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is most {{commonly}} relied upon {{for the detection}} of acute ischaemic infarct due to arterial large vessel occlusion (LVO), a wide variety of pathologies may result in abnormal DWI signal. The DWI signal increases when the random (Brownian) diffusivity of water molecules is reduced or restricted. The magnitude of diffusion can be quantified by calculating the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), where lower values represent areas of reduced diffusion [1]. In the setting of acute ischaemic infarct, energy metabolites are depleted, resulting in failure of <b>membrane</b> <b>ion</b> <b>pumps,</b> with extracellular water following the influx of sodium into the intracellular space. This leads to cytotoxic oedema, a pathological process defined by intracellular expansion due to osmotic shifts. With water molecules effectively trapped in the intracellular space, the ADC decreases, resulting in a hyperintense DWI signal. Any cellular process involving derangement of the physiologic exchange of water across cell membranes, regardless of whether the process leads to neuronal demise and apoptosis, can result in cytotoxic oedema and abnormal signal on DWI. For more detailed descriptions of cytotoxic oedema and the physical principles of DWI, we direct readers to comprehensive reviews by Simard et al. and Hagmann et al., respectively [2, 3].|$|R

40|$|We {{postulate}} {{that the}} genetic factor increasing the propensity {{of black people}} of sub-Saharan African descent to develop high blood pressure is the relatively high activity of creatine kinase, predominantly in vascular and cardiac muscle tissue. Such greater activity of creatine kinase {{has been reported in}} skeletal muscle of black untrained subjects has been reported to be almost twice the activity found in white subjects. Creatine kinase, a key enzyme of cellular energy metabolism, increases the capacity of the cell to function under high demands. The enzyme regulates, buffers and transports, via phosphocreatine and creatine, energy produced by glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation to sites of energy consumption such as myofibrils and <b>membrane</b> <b>ion</b> <b>pumps.</b> At these cellular locations, it is involved in the contraction process and active trans- membranous transport by readily providing the ATP needed for these processes. In addition, creatine kinase is increasingly reported to be involved in trophic responses. Furthermore, by using H+ and ADP to synthesize ATP, creatine kinase prevents acidification of the cell, providing relative protection against the effects of ischaemia. Greater creatine kinase activity in cardiovascular muscle and other tissues with high energy demands could increase cardiovascular contractile reserve, enhance trophic responses and increase renal tubular ability to retain salt. This could facilitate the development of arterial hypertension under chronic provocative circumstances, with higher mean blood pressures, more left ventricular hypertrophy and relatively fewer ischaemic events. Therefore, greater cellular activity of creatine kinase might explain the greater hypertension risk and the clinical characteristics of hypertensive disease observed in the black populatio...|$|R

50|$|The {{actions of}} the Na-K-ATPase enzyme relate with the {{creation}} of calcium-signaling microdomains. Na-K-ATPase is a protein that pumps Na+ and K+ across the cell membrane. Na-K-ATPase helps to keep the body at equilibrium by the movement of those ions through the plasma <b>membrane.</b> This <b>ion</b> <b>pump</b> helps to reset the movement of ions during an action potential by sending K+ into the cell and sending Na+ out of the cell. Since it opposes the normal flow of ions during an action potential, energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is used. Calcium is also regulated using this Na-K-ATPase due to the enzyme's interactions with protein and non-protein molecules.The main interaction that keeps calcium regulated is the binding of Na-K-ATPase to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 is a secondary messenger that helps to send neuronal signals through the body. The neuronal cells have the calcium-signaling microdomains in the cytoplasm right next to the pre- and post-synaptic calcium channels in the nerve cells. Figure 1 {{is an example of how}} Na-K-ATPase forms the calcium-signaling microdomain.|$|R
2500|$|The key to neural {{function}} is the synaptic signaling process, which is partly electrical and partly chemical. The electrical aspect depends on {{properties of the}} neuron's membrane. Like all animal cells, [...] the cell body of every neuron is enclosed by a plasma membrane, a bilayer of lipid molecules with many types of protein structures embedded in it. A lipid bilayer is a powerful electrical insulator, but in neurons, many of the protein structures embedded in the membrane are electrically active. These include ion channels that permit electrically charged ions to flow across the <b>membrane</b> and <b>ion</b> <b>pumps</b> that actively transport ions {{from one side of}} the membrane to the other. Most ion channels are permeable only to specific types of ions. Some ion channels are voltage gated, meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by altering the voltage difference across the membrane. Others are chemically gated, meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by interactions with chemicals that diffuse through the extracellular fluid. The interactions between ion channels and <b>ion</b> <b>pumps</b> produce a voltage difference across the membrane, typically a bit less than 1/10 of a volt at baseline. This voltage has two functions: first, it provides a power source for an assortment of voltage-dependent protein machinery that is embedded in the membrane; second, it provides a basis for electrical signal transmission between different parts of the membrane.|$|R
30|$|Note that neurons {{communicate}} with each other through so-called action potentials that can be interpreted as the transmitted electrical signals [43]. A liquid membrane separates neuron whose intracellular components are rich in K+ ions from outside environment whose extracellular component has high concentration of Na+ and Cl− ions. This non-uniform ion distribution across the membrane polarizes the membrane with a certain resting potential between − 90 and − 40  mV [44], when the cell membrane does not experience any external stimulus, i.e. in its rest state. Nevertheless, when subject to an external electric stimuli above some certain threshold, the ions can exchange through voltage-gated ion channels that are activated by the change of the electrical <b>membrane</b> potential and <b>ion</b> <b>pumps</b> between intracellular and extracellular media to lower the chemical potential gradient [45 – 49]. Such a re-distribution of the <b>ions</b> across <b>membrane</b> leads to the depolarization of the neuron, also known as action potential firing responsible for the signal transmission from the neuron soma to the terminal of the neuron axon [43]. However, this depolarized state would soon restore to the previously rest state after Na+/K+ <b>ion</b> <b>pumps</b> recover its <b>ion</b> distribution to the rest state, called sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na+/K+-ATPase) [50]. Therefore, the state change of the neuron or cell membrane is considered as ‘elastic’ meaning no permanent change occurring when the external stimuli exceeds the threshold value.|$|R
