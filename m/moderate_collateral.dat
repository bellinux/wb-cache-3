40|$|Background : The {{interferon}} alpha 2 b recombinant, {{produced in}} Cuba, {{is used in}} the treatment of different illnesses, such as the multiple sclerosis. For its commercialization it is needed to know its safety scope. Objective : To assess the adverse reactions of interferon alpha 2 b recombinant in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Method: During the period between 1996 and 2006, 70 clinical histories and data collection notebooks of patients included in the randomized double blind national clinical trial phase IV were revised. This trial was developed in the Clinic of Multiple Sclerosis of the Hospital "Dr. Gustavo Aldereguía Lima" in Cienfuegos. With regard to the total of manifested adverse reactions we analyzed type, length, and use of a given treatment to counteract them, intensity level (light, moderate, serious or lethal) and causality level (definitive, probable, possible, conditional or not related). Results: 53 patients out of the total presented 207 adverse reactions to interferon. The most frequent were: fever, migraine, chills, arthralgia, asthenia and myalgia, being most of them <b>moderate</b> <b>collateral</b> effects of definitive character. In 197 patients the outcome was favorable. Conclusion : The use of the interferon alpha 2 b recombinant was safe in the treatment of the multiple sclerosis in these patients.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{randomized}} trials have proven {{the benefit of}} intra-arterial treatment (IAT) with retrievable stents in acute ischemic stroke. Patients with poor or absent collaterals (preexistent anastomoses to maintain blood flow {{in case of a}} primary vessel occlusion) may gain less clinical benefit from IAT. In this post hoc analysis, we aimed to assess whether the effect of IAT was modified by collateral status on baseline computed tomographic angiography in the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN). MR CLEAN was a multicenter, randomized trial of IAT versus no IAT. Primary outcome was the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days. The primary effect parameter was the adjusted common odds ratio for a shift in direction of a better outcome on the modified Rankin Scale. Collaterals were graded from 0 (absent) to 3 (good). We used multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis with interaction terms to estimate treatment effect modification by collateral status. We found a significant modification of treatment effect by collaterals (P= 0. 038). The strongest benefit (adjusted common odds ratio 3. 2 [95 % confidence intervals 1. 7 - 6. 2]) was found in patients with good collaterals (grade 3). The adjusted common odds ratio was 1. 6 [95 % confidence intervals 1. 0 - 2. 7] for <b>moderate</b> <b>collaterals</b> (grade 2), 1. 2 [95 % confidence intervals 0. 7 - 2. 3] for poor collaterals (grade 1), and 1. 0 [95 % confidence intervals 0. 1 - 8. 7] for patients with absent collaterals (grade 0). In MR CLEAN, baseline computed tomographic angiography collateral status modified the treatment effect. The benefit of IAT was greatest in patients with good collaterals on baseline computed tomographic angiography. Treatment benefit appeared less and may be absent in patients with absent or poor collaterals. URL: [URL] and [URL] Unique identifier: (NTR) 1804 and ISRCTN 10888758, respectivel...|$|R

40|$|Background: The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the interobserver and intraobserver agreement on ligamentous injuries on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in acute simple elbow dislocation. The secondary objectives were to determine the interobserver agreement on the assessment of joint congruity, joint effusion, loose bodies and chondral lesions on conventional MRI. Methods: Conventional MRIs (1. 5 Tesla, elbow specific surface coil) of 30 patients (40. 7  years; range 14 – 72) with simple elbow dislocations were evaluated by four blinded examiners. An analysis of the interobserver agreement of all raters and for several subgroups (radiologists, orthopaedics, experienced, non-experienced) was performed. The examiners assessed the integrity (intact, partial tear, complete tear) of the lateral collateral ligament (LCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), extensor and flexor tendons, as well as the presence of joint congruity, joint effusion, loose bodies and chondral lesions. Agreement strength, correlation and proportion of exact agreement were determined for interobserver agreement, and intraobserver agreement analyses. Results: Interobserver agreement of all examiners was fair to <b>moderate</b> for <b>collateral</b> ligaments (LCL: 0. 441, MCL: 0. 275). Exact agreement of all raters was found in 33. 3 % for the LCL and in 26. 7 % for the MCL. The both experienced examiners showed highest agreement strength for the LCL (0. 619) and the radiologists showed highest agreement strength for the MCL (0. 627), the proportion of exact agreement was 60. 0 % in both categories. A high proportion of exact agreement regarding joint congruity (90 %), joint effusion (100 %), loose bodies (96. 7 %) and chondral lesion (80 %) was found among the radiologists. The evaluation of the intraobserver agreement revealed slight to substantial agreement (0. 227 to 0. 718) for the collateral ligaments. Conclusions: This study shows difficulties in the evaluation of ligaments by conventional MRI technique as demonstrated by a weak inter- and intraobserver agreement. This should be the basis to develop new MRI quality standards with special focus on coronal oblique reconstructions to improve the evaluation of ligament injuries after simple elbow dislocations...|$|R
40|$|Feline {{herpesvirus}} 1 (FHV- 1) is {{a widespread}} cat pathogen inducing rhinitis, conjunctivitis and corneal ulcers. To alleviate acute FHV- 1 -induced disease, antiviral agents are used often with antibiotics. But sometimes, these treatments, as well as conventional doses of cytokines have <b>moderate</b> efficacy and/or <b>collateral</b> effects. Herein we have investigated the effects of low dose interleukin (IL) - 12 plus interferon (IFN) -gamma, prepared by Sequential Kinetic Activated (SKA), on the treatment of FHV- 1 infection. Twenty-five, unvaccinated FHV- 1 -positive cats were recruited into a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial. Fifteen cats were treated for 6 months with oral low doses of SKA IL- 12 plus IFN-gamma and 10 cats were treated with placebo. At 1, 6 and 12 months (follow-up) after the beginning of treatment, clinical assessment, PCR assay and blood count were carried out. At follow-up, in treated group, we observed significant (p< 0. 05) improvements in clinical signs and PCR became negative in 12 / 15 cats (80 %). In placebo, 10 / 10 cats were PCR-positive, with improvements (30 %) or worsening (70 %) in clinical signs. Blood values were normal in both groups. Our {{results show that the}} low dose therapy, based on activated solutions of IL- 12 plus IFN-gamma, represents a novel approach to treat FHV- 1 infection in cats...|$|R
