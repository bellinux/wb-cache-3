40|$|The {{present study}} reports the induction, histopathology, immunocytochemistry, growth pattern and proliferative {{behaviour}} of mesenchymal tumours of the urinary bladder of rats induced {{by a single}} intravesical dose (5 mg/kg/body weight) of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU). In 14 of 283 female Wistar rats (incidence: 4. 9 %). 16 non-epithelial tumours had developed after an experimental period of 14 months. The most common histological type induced was of fibrohistiocytic origin (eight benign-appearing and three <b>malignant</b> <b>fibrous</b> <b>histiocytomas).</b> Furthermore, two pure histiocytomas (one benign and one malignant) and three capillary and cavernous haemangiomas were produced. Since no metastases occurred and no clear-cut distinction between a merely expansive and a truly invasive growth was possible, the diagnosis of malignancy {{was based on the}} degree of cellular atypia and the mitotic activity. The benign-appearing <b>fibrous</b> <b>histiocytomas</b> showed a mean mitotic index of 0. 06 % and the <b>malignant</b> <b>fibrous</b> <b>histiocytomas</b> of 0. 34 %. The mitotic activity of the malignant histiocytoma was threefold (0. 78 %) as high as in the benign-appearing histiocytoma (0. 25 %). There exist close morphological similarities between the induced mesenchymal tumours in the rat and those occurring in the human bladder. Although the spectrum of histological types of mesenchymal tumours seen in the rat bladder was narrower than that encountered in man, MNU seems suitable for further studying the histogenesis, histopathology and biology of experimentally induced non-epithelial bladder neoplasms to gain information for {{a better understanding of the}} pathogenesis of human disease...|$|R

40|$|Myxoid liposarcomas have {{a unique}} and {{specific}} t(12; 16) (q 13;p 11) chromosomal translocation. The breakpoint has recently been identified and shown to involve the TLS/FUS gene on chromosome 16 and the CHOP gene on chromosome 12. This translocation causes fusion of these genes resulting in {{the expression of a}} novel chimeric TLS/FUS-CHOP message. Using the polymerase chain reaction with primer sets derived from sequences of TLS/FUS and CHOP cDNAs, we could amplify three types of the fusion transcripts from seven of seven samples of myxoid and round cell liposarcomas. In six of the seven positive samples, two kinds of chimeric messenger RNAs were found that have been reported previously. However, the last sample had a novel chimeric message that had an extra sequence of 33 bp derived from the TLS/FUS gene. Thus, it was shown that these fusion transcripts had a varying extent of the sequence of TLS/FUS gene incorporated {{at the site of the}} fusion. However, the TLS/FUS-CHOP fusion transcripts were not detected in two pleomorphic liposarcomas or in three myxoid variants of <b>malignant</b> <b>fibrous</b> <b>histiocytomas.</b> Our findings indicate that in liposarcomas TLS/FUS-CHOP fusion transcripts have variations at the junction of chimeric messages, which was the case for Ewing's sarcoma. Detection of the chimeric message by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was also suggested to be a useful approach for the diagnosis of myxoid and round cell liposarcomas that have (12; 16) translocation, and for distinguishing them from pleomorphic liposarcoma and myxoid variant of <b>malignant</b> <b>fibrous</b> <b>histiocytomas...</b>|$|R
