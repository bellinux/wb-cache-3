5|$|To begin with, {{every one}} <b>must</b> <b>buy</b> this {{book for the}} {{following}} aesthetic reasons: First, because I know where there is the cutest cloth of gold dress for only $300 in a store on Forty-second Street, and, also, if enough people buy it {{where there is a}} platinum ring with a complete circlet, and, also, if loads of people buy it my husband needs a new winter overcoat, although the one he has done well enough for the last three years... It seems to me that on one page I recognized a portion of an old diary of mine which mysteriously disappeared shortly after my marriage, and, also, scraps of letters which, though considerably edited, sound to me vaguely familiar. In fact, Mr. Fitzgerald—I believe that is how he spells his name—seems to believe that plagiarism begins at home.|$|E

25|$|An {{article in}} Canadian {{newspaper}} National Post, based upon interviews of Cubans, finds that in reality {{even the most}} common pharmaceutical items, such as aspirin and antibiotics are conspicuously absent or only available {{on the black market}}.

25|$|Investors may not {{be members}} of stock exchanges. Rather they <b>must</b> <b>buy</b> and sell {{securities}} through broker-dealers which are registered with the appropriate regulatory body for that purpose. In accepting investors as clients, broker-dealers take on the risks of their clients {{not being able to}} meet their financial obligations. Hence retail (individual) investors generally are required to keep their investment assets in custody with the broker-dealer through which they buy and sell securities. A broker-dealer would normally not accept an order to buy from a retail clients unless there is sufficient cash on deposit with the broker-dealer {{to cover the cost of}} the order, nor sell unless the client already has the security in the broker-dealer's custody.|$|E
25|$|Most {{buffer stock}} schemes work {{along the same}} rough lines: first, two prices are determined, a floor and a ceiling (minimum and maximum price). When the price drops close to the floor price (after a new rich vein of silver is found, for example), the scheme {{operator}} (usually government) will start buying up the stock, ensuring that the price does not fall further. Likewise, when the price rises close to the ceiling, the operator depresses the price by selling off its holding. In the meantime, it must either store the commodity or otherwise {{keep it out of}} the market (for example, by destroying it). If a basket of commodities is stored, their price stabilization can in turn stabilize the overall price level, preventing inflation. This scenario is illustrated on the right. Taking the market for wheat as an example, here, in years with normal harvests (S1) the price is within the allowed range and the operator does not need to act. In bumper years (S3), however, the prices begins to fall, and the government <b>must</b> <b>buy</b> wheat to prevent the price from collapsing; likewise, in years with bad harvests (S2), the government must sell its stock to keep prices down. The result is far less fluctuation in price. Price stability then leads to greater joint welfare (the sum of consumer and producer surplus.|$|E

500|$|A lack of [...] "eye-popping unpredictability [...] its predecessors" [...] and {{difficult}} controller positions disappointed 1UP.com, but the website still called WarioWare: Smooth Moves a [...] "welcome addition to any Wii library".

500|$|Islam is {{the common}} {{heritage}} in the region with a 97.22% Muslim majority according to the 1998 Pakistan census report and 2001 population data sheet.

People live in tight-knit joint families, although a nuclear family system is emerging due to changing socio-economic conditions. Ancient Pakistani culture prevails in most marriage practices in the region, as do certain restrictions related to ethnicity and caste. [...] However, the influences of more modern societies have effected some change, particularly {{in the area of the}} dowry system.

In some instances, the husband <b>must</b> <b>buy</b> his wife from her parents.

500|$|Soon {{after its}} release, Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal {{received}} critical acclaim. GameSpy awarded it 5 stars out of 5, and IGN said that [...] "You <b>MUST</b> <b>buy</b> this immediately" [...] {{due to its}} extensive line-up of weaponry, high quality graphics and polished sound effects. IGN did, however, believe it was easier than the previous game, Going Commando, while GameSpot thought that the gameplay was too similar to the previous title, but both reviewers considered these as minor issues and they made little difference to the overall score. Gaming magazines GamesTM and Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine both mentioned that the offbeat comedy that was apparent throughout {{the majority of the}} game was one of the points that made it unique. X-Play said [...] "A mixture of excellent gameplay tweaks and new activities make the third one easily the strongest game in the series {{and one of the best}} games of this year" [...] and giving it a full five star rating. According to Metacritic's collection of reviews, 12 separate reviewers gave the game the highest possible score.

In August 2005 Up Your Arsenal entered the Greatest Hits line-up. Since its release, it has sold over 2.15 million copies in the US alone.
