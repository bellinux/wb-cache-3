25|$|My dad was not {{the monster}} my lying brother said he was; he was strict, but my father never beat us black and blue, and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. I have nothing but fond {{memories}} of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote Going My Own Way out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name {{was the only way}} he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was {{the only way he could}} get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers. My dad was my hero. I loved him very <b>much.</b> <b>He</b> <b>loved</b> all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.|$|E

Robert Weatherwax, Rudd's son, later recalled, [...] "It hit him very hard when Pal died. He buried him in a special place on the ranch and would often visit the grave. Dad would never again watch an MGM Lassie movie. He just couldn't bear to see Pal. He didn't want to have to be {{reminded}} of just how <b>much</b> <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> that dog." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{early stages}} of the album's development, Joey was dating Linda Danielle. After the album was released, however, Danielle left Joey and became Johnny's girlfriend. Ramones' road manager Monte Melnick relates: [...] "Joey was devastated. It {{affected}} him deeply. Johnny knew it was bad and kept Linda totally hidden from that point on. She didn't come to many shows and if she did he'd hide her in the back; she wouldn't come backstage. He'd run out to meet her and leave {{as soon as they were}} done." [...] While Johnny would eventually marry Linda, Joey held a strong grudge against them both, and, though they continued to perform and tour together, the two rarely talked to each other. Joey explained that Johnny had [...] "crossed the line" [...] once he started dating Danielle, and noted that [...] "he destroyed the relationship and the band right there." [...] Johnny defended himself by stating that had Danielle not left Joey for him, [...] "he wouldn't have even been talking about her and saying how <b>much</b> <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> her because he wouldn't have been obsessed about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Aspects of [...] "The Big Bang" [...] were {{outlined}} by lead writer {{and executive producer}} Steven Moffat as he planned the arc of the series. Moffat stated he left room to improvise on the story and {{was pleased with the}} result, describing it as [...] "mad" [...] and [...] "amazing". Moffat stated that the title [...] "The Big Bang" [...] is his favourite dirty Doctor Who joke as it is a reference to the fact that Amy and Rory conceive their child on the TARDIS that night, as revealed in the next series in [...] "A Good Man Goes to War". Gillan described Rory's vigil for Amy as the [...] "ultimate romantic gesture" [...] which showed how <b>much</b> <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> Amy, and was where Amy realised how much she loved him. Moffat thought that standing guard for two thousand years would make up for shooting her. Moffat had always intended for Amy and Rory to get married [...] "from the off". Moffat described the conclusion as the story of how Amy has been changed by the Doctor and the Doctor's success at restoring her spirit to the girl he first met, believing that a man could drop out of the sky and [...] "fix everything". However, he did not return for her as he had promised and she grew believing that he was a liar and could not be trusted; Amy returns to her original belief when she stands up at her wedding and proclaims that the Doctor is real and that he will arrive. Though the episode {{is the end of the}} series, Moffat left questions to be answered in the next series, including the mystery of River Song's identity and the [...] "Silence" [...] which appeared to cause the TARDIS to blow up.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of Douglas's stroke the {{previous}} summer, however, in which he lost most of his speaking ability, his close friends and family were concerned about whether he should try to speak, or what he should say. Both his son, Michael, and his long-time friend, Jack Valenti, urged him to only say [...] "Thank you", and leave the stage. Douglas agreed. But when {{standing in front of}} the audience, he had second thoughts: [...] "I intended to just say 'thank you,' but I saw 1,000 people, and felt I had to say something more, and I did." [...] Valenti remembers that after Douglas held up the Oscar, addressed his sons, and told his wife how <b>much</b> <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> her, everyone was astonished at his voice's improvement: ...|$|E
2500|$|Also {{unconnected}} to {{the anthrax}} attacks {{was a large}} envelope received at American Media, Inc. in Boca Raton, Florida (which was among {{the victims of the}} attacks) in September 2001.

The writer said how <b>much</b> <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> her and asked her to marry him." [...] Another letter, which mimicked the original anthrax letter to Senator Daschle, was mailed to Daschle from London in November 2001, at a time when Hatfill was in England, not far from London. Shortly before the discovery of the anthrax letters, someone sent a letter to authorities stating, [...] "Dr. Assaad is a potential biological terrorist." [...] No connection to the anthrax letters was ever found.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 October, {{accompanied}} by the four remaining members of Boyzone, his body was brought from Majorca to Dublin where his funeral {{took place at the}} Church of St Laurence O'Toole the following day. The four surviving members of Boyzone maintained an overnight vigil in the church the night before. Thousands of fans, celebrities and politicians were in attendance at the funeral. Fans had travelled from as far as Nottingham, South Africa and Taiwan to attend the funeral. He was cremated in a private ceremony later that afternoon. Gately's coffin was carried {{into and out of the}} church by his bandmates, and during the service Ronan Keating gave an emotional eulogy, during which he broke down several times and apologised to the congregation. Keith Duffy reminisced on the early days: [...] "He told Louis [...] he was 5ft 7in. When he auditioned for The Hobbit later on, he said he was 5ft 3in. But he was a true giant of a man". Michael Graham said Gately had only told him the previous week how <b>much</b> <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> Cowles, adding: [...] "When he came out, he finally became himself".

2500|$|In 1998 Lionel {{was shocked}} to {{discover}} he had fathered a son, 16-year-old Luke Billingham (Greg Freeman) when he himself was 16. Luke debuted as a [...] "shy, inarticulate country boy with an adventurous spirit" [...] who shockingly revealed to Lionel that he was his son. Though Lionel was in shock, he took Luke in, Leigh stated, [...] "Lionel’s struggling {{to get through it}} as fatherhood is thrust upon him. He just inherited a 16-year-old son unlike most people who get to watch their kids from a baby and slowly get used to them." [...] The storyline proved to be hugely topical, with the amount of single parent families in the nineties was at an all-time high. Luke instantly got into trouble in his new home, he was involved in a robbery at Lionel's bar, drove Lionel's car without a driver's license and stole a credit card to access online pornography. Despite this, Leigh insisted Lionel was the best possible father, [...] "Lionel’s the best father. He talks through the troubles." [...] After initially struggling to connect with Luke, when he was involved in a dramatic bus crash Lionel realised how <b>much</b> <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> his son and even went to the extent of cooking him gourmet school lunches. After only knowing each other a year, the father-son partnership was broken after Lionel died in scenes that Freeman described as, [...] "draining". Luke soon became a father with his teenage bride, Josie Bergman (Karamia Muller) at age 16, similarly to his father Lionel.|$|E
