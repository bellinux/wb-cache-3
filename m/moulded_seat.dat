40|$|The {{conventional}} wheelchair sling seat provides {{little or}} no support to the spine {{of a child with}} myopathy or neurogenic muscular weakness. As the spinal muscles become weaker scoliosis may develop with associated deformity, pain and restriction of cardio-respiratory function. If muscle weakness is severe, the resultant fully developed deformity is virtually impossible to treat. Slowing the rate of increase of the deformity is, therefore, the most hopeful avenue of attack. This work addresses the hypothesis that custom <b>moulded</b> <b>seating</b> can increase sitting comfort and slow the rate of progression of spinal curvature in children with paralytic scoliosis, and further, that a range of standard or modular seats can achieve these goals at less cost. Previous work on this problem has ranged from simply padding the armrest, in order to distribute force over the rib cage, through to custom <b>moulded</b> <b>seating.</b> Our initial experience with custom moulding, using the bean bag evacuation and consolidation technique, produced several comfortable seats although the technique was labour intensive and therefore costly. This led us to attempt to develop a method of providing comfortable seating that would help control spinal deformity at reasonable cost. This paper describes the design of a standardized seating system for school age children with myopathy or neurogenic muscular weakness. Preliminary results indicate that this technique may have advantages over alternative methods of treatment. The radiological study is continuing. All comes ondence to be addressed to Dr. B. R...|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the design and construction of wooden chairs. The work has both theoretical and practical parts, which are divided into main chapters and subchapters. The first part focuses on the main classifications of chairs: according to their geometrical parameters, <b>moulded</b> <b>seats</b> and backrests. Further research considers historical styles, from {{the second half of}} the nineteenth century to the present. General requirements, as well as those of safety, ergonomics and anthropometry are given in the next chapter. The second part deals with designing a new chair. Findings from the first part are applied at the drafting stage. Current requirements and aesthetic considerations are taken into account. The final designs chosen were then turned into technical drawings and visualizations...|$|R
50|$|Whereas 1930s {{furniture}} {{had been}} heavy and ponderous, Day’s post-war designs were light {{on their feet}} and economical {{in their use of}} materials. His Reclining Chair (1952), for example, had a slim angular upholstered seat, floating wooden armrests and U-shaped steel rod legs. A minimalist frame was also adopted for the 675 Chair (1953), a dining chair with a slender floating <b>moulded</b> plywood <b>seat</b> back. In the Q Stak Chair (1954), Day’s first one-piece moulded plywood shell chair, the number of components was reduced to the bare minimum in order to keep costs down.|$|R

50|$|Cockpits {{are usually}} fully {{open and the}} only covered area {{is a very small}} and spartan fore-cabin (cuddy), usually used only for storing sails and {{essential}} safety equipment. Even larger sports yachts which often do have a proper cabin below are often missing all the usual features of a yacht. Sinks, toilets, bunks, water tanks and cooking equipment are usually missing. Often a <b>moulded</b> hard plastic <b>seat</b> {{on either side of the}} cuddy and a removable chemical toilet are the only amenities.|$|R

500|$|The {{interior}} of the P4/5 was designed by Glickenhaus himself with an iPod nano stereo and a tablet PC which features not only GPS but a 3D model of the car {{as well as a}} complete parts list and manual for easy servicing. The P4/5 also sports improved air conditioning over the Enzo and a high-strength alloy roll bar redesigned because the original was too thick and obstructed Glickenhaus' view. The seats are custom built, Glickenhaus' and his son's bodies were scanned so Pininfarina could <b>mould</b> the <b>seats</b> for their comfort, accessibility and view of the road (as with race cars). With a frame of carbon fibre composite, the seats are covered with a black mesh and red leather as selected by Glickenhaus' daughter. Pininfarina rearranged the wiring of the car so as to make the car easier to service and [...] lighter than the Enzo.|$|R
5000|$|... 1951 was an annus mirabilis for Robin Day. His {{seating for}} the Royal Festival Hall and his {{high-profile}} {{contributions to the}} Festival of Britain, held on the neighbouring site on London’s South Bank, greatly enhanced his professional reputation. The brief for the Royal Festival Hall project was complex and demanding, including restaurant and foyer furniture, auditorium seating and orchestra chairs, each with specific functional requirements. Always keen to explore new manufacturing processes, Day co-opted materials and technology from the automotive industry for his concert hall seating, which was fabricated from pressed steel, supported by cast steel stanchions. This proved so effective {{that it is still}} in use today. The chairs he designed for the restaurant and foyer had sculptural <b>moulded</b> plywood <b>seats</b> with wing-like armrests and spindly black steel rod legs. Day was the first designer in Britain to exploit these materials in furniture. His chairs were revolutionary at the time as they appeared to hover above the ground.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} processes and a device for flexibly and automatically deburring and removing from moulds injection <b>moulded</b> workpieces <b>seated</b> on cores and for cleaning injection moulding tool cores and moulds, said device {{being used in}} a variety of different ways and being adaptable in a simple manner to various injection moulding tools of a variety of shapes. At least partly standardized tool units are used for adapting them to the production of various tool geometries, core clearances and similar by simply modifying the spatial arrangement of individual modular tool components to the tool units, whereby the sprue is first cut off and the front-end and longitudinal burr on the moulded workpieces are removed by translational and/or rotational movement from inside a first tool unit using grouped cutting tools, followed by the removal from the moulds of mould removal supports provided with an integrated burst protection by second tool unit whereby the burst protection is pushed o ver the workpiece before the mould removal supports, and after extraction of the workpiece or workpieces from the mould tools, they are cleaned by a third tool unit which has a roller arrangement movable in the radial and axial directions...|$|R
40|$|When {{using an}} office chair, a person comes into {{direct contact with}} the seat, where the contact surface creates a {{microclimate}} that affects the person’s positive or negative mood, depending on temperature and humidity. Relative to temperature and moisture, this microclimate may produce either a positive or a negative effect on a seated person. Foam based padding of seats and backrests have upholstery with insulating properties that prevent the escape of bodily heat and moisture. The present work, carried out with six subjects, was aimed at studying temperature and moisture as the contributing factors to sitting comfort during performance of usual tasks under controlled conditions. The study method employed temperature and moisture measurements on five different office chairs using the probes placed on or in the seats. The statistically evaluated results of objective measurements show significant differences in distribution of temperature and moisture among the tested seats and through different layers of padding materials and upholstery of individual seats. Generally, it may be concluded that the temperature on the seat surface is always higher than inside the seat. On the other hand, humidity is always lower on the seat surface. Temperature and moisture on the surface of <b>moulded</b> foam <b>seats</b> are higher than on other kinds of seats...|$|R
