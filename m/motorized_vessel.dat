50|$|Held captive with Sparks {{aboard the}} Black Gull {{by the chief}} {{smuggler}} Crowfoot, the boys pretend to cast in with the smuggler. Crowfeet tells the boys about the ship’s secret repeller belts around the hull which hold off any <b>motorized</b> <b>vessel</b> or aircraft, allowing the Black Gull (under many different names) to escape from much faster ships and explaining how the boys adrift in the fishing boat {{were able to get}} so close with the fishing boats engine shut down due to fuel exhaustion. After the Black Gulls radio operator falls ill, Crowfeet presses a seemingly reluctant Sparks into service to send messages. The boys then take turns sending coded messages via innocent-sounding nursery rhymes to their father, including the line “sailing, sailing, over the bounding main, for many a sailing ship can go faster…”. Soon a sleek racing sloop under full sail (immune to the effects of the repeller which only affects motor vessels) approaches and quickly overtakes the slow freighter. Coast Guard officers board and rescue the boys, Sparks, and the captured scientists who had been kidnapped and forced to work for the smuggler. Among them is a chemist who had developed the techniques used to artificially age paper to supply forged documents for sale in the antique / rare document market. The elderly “smuggler” Mitchell turns out to be Mr. McClintocks former business partner and is happily reunited with Mr. McClintock aboard the Father Neptune. With Mitchell rescued, the entire design for the repeller belt is recovered and Mr. McClintock and Mitchell agree to turn the design over to the US Government.

40|$|Each year, {{more than}} 500 <b>motorized</b> <b>vessel</b> {{groundings}} cause widespread damage to seagrasses in Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS). Under Section 312 of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (NMSA), any party {{responsible for the}} loss, injury, or destruction of any Sanctuary resource, including seagrass, is liable to the United States for response costs and resulting damages. As part of the damage assessment process, a cellular automata model is utilized to forecast seagrass recovery rates. Field validation of these forecasts was accomplished by comparing model-predicted percent recovery to that which was observed to be occurring naturally for 30 documented vessel grounding sites. Model recovery forecasts for both Thalassia testudinum and Syringodium filiforme exceeded natural recovery estimates for 93. 1 % and 89. 5 % of the sites, respectively. For Halodule wrightii, the number of over- and under-predictions by the model was similar. However, where under-estimation occurred, it was often severe, reflecting the well-known extraordinary growth potential of this opportunistic species. These preliminary findings indicate that the recovery model is consistently generous to Responsible Parties in that the model forecasts a much faster recovery than was observed to occur naturally, particularly for T. testudinum, the dominant seagrass species {{in the region and}} the species most often affected. Environmental setting (i. e., location, wave exposure) influences local seagrass landscape pattern and may also {{play a role in the}} recovery dynamics for a particular injury site.

Giant kelpfish exhibited acute stress responses when exposed to intermittent noise, but not to continuous noise or control conditions (playback of recorded natural ambient sound). These results suggest that variability in the acoustic environment may be more important than the period of noise exposure for inducing stress in a marine fish, and provide information regarding noise levels at which physiological responses occur...|$|R

40|$|Small-scale {{fisheries}} are {{the primary}} users of many coastal fish stocks; yet, spatial and temporal patterns of recreational and subsistence fishing in coastal marine ecosystems are poorly documented. Knowledge about the spatial distribution of fishing activities can inform place-based management that balances species conservation with opportunities for recreation and subsistence. We used a participatory mapping approach to document changes in spatial fishing patterns of 80 boat-based recreational anglers from 1950 to 2010 in Puget Sound, Washington, USA. Hand-drawn fishing areas for salmon, rockfishes, flatfishes, and crabs were digitized and analyzed in a Geographic Information System. We found that recreational fishing has spanned the majority of Puget Sound since the 1950 s, with the heaviest use limited to small areas of central and northern Puget Sound. People are still fishing in the same places they were decades ago, with relatively little change in specific locations despite widespread declines in salmon and bottomfish populations {{during the second half}} of the 20 th century. While the location of core fishing areas remained consistent, the size of those areas and intensity of use changed over time. The size of fishing areas increased through the 2000 s for salmon but declined after the 1970 s and 1980 s for rockfishes, flatfishes, and crabs. Our results suggest that the spatial extent of recreational bottomfishing increased after the 1960 s, when the availability of <b>motorized</b> <b>vessels</b> and advanced fish-finding technologies allowed anglers to expand their scope beyond localized angling from piers and boathouses. Respondents offered a wide range of reasons for shifts in fishing areas over time, reflecting substantial individual variation in motivations and behaviors.

40|$|This thesis {{scrutinize the}} insight from {{emerging}} theories on cooperation in common-pool resources. The models of co-management {{were inspired by}} examples of collective action among people, which is {{in stark contrast to}} the prominent tragedy of commons metaphor. The focus in this thesis is on the effect of technological change on the co-management of a natural renewable resource. The fishery of Lofoten is explored during the years 1864 – 1988, as this fishery has been regarded as an example of successful co-management. It had for instance a local governance structure that integrated the fishermen into the decision making process. Furthermore, the fishery of Lofoten is well documented with the annual Lofoten reports (Lofotberetningene). The data set is extracted from these unique historical documents. During the years of 1905 – 1920, a rapid technological progress occurred as the share of <b>motorized</b> <b>vessels</b> increased from 0 to 40 per cent. This period coincide with increasing violations of the co-management rules and regulations. A regression model is used to measure these violations, which serves as a proxy for defection in the co-management. The result shows that a shock in motorization was associated with a strong and significant effect on violations of the rules and regulations. Furthermore, it suggests that technological change affects the cooperation of a common-pool resource. The strain on cooperation would then increase because of the chances of higher effort and gear conflicts in the fishery, due to higher mobility and speed. The findings encompass the emerging theories, and it shows that a rapid technological change is associated with a significant eroding cooperation in a common-pool resource. It shows that the pressure towards stronger monitoring and enforcement is associated with increasing technological progress...|$|R

40|$|Marine {{and coastal}} tourism has rapidly {{expanded}} worldwide {{in the past}} 2 decades, often occurring in once secluded habitats. In Alaska, tourism near tidewater glaciers has attracted millions of visitors and increased the presence of ships, tour vessels, and coastal development. Although sustainable tourism, resulting from balanced effects on wildlife and client satisfaction, is a goal of most tourism operators, {{it is not always}} achieved. Voluntary compliance with viewing guidelines and codes of conduct have been encouraged, but few assessments have the longitudinal scope to evaluate long-term changes in impacts on wildlife and the ability of vessel operators and kayak guides to sustain lower impact operating practices over time. This study assessed vessel and kayak visitation and resulting impacts on harbor seals in the Kenai Fjords National Park, southcentral Alaska. We obtained observations from 2002 to 2011, using remotely controlled video cameras located near Aialik and Pedersen Glaciers in the Kenai Fjords National Park. Overall, disturbance was associated with 5. 1 % of vessel sightings, 28 % of vessel interactions (vessel observed within approx. 300 m of seals), 11. 5 % of kayak sightings, and 61 % of kayak interactions. Results demonstrated that voluntary changes in operations significantly reduced vessel and kayak disturbance of seals by 60 – 80 %. Even with prior establishment of operating guidelines, tour vessel captains were able to further reduce their effect on wildlife with more careful operations. Rapid growth of guided kayak excursions that occurred during this study caused greater disturbance to seals than <b>motorized</b> <b>vessels</b> but guide trainings helped reduce disturbances. Diminished impacts of motor vessels and kayakers persisted across years although effects of kayaks were less consistent than motor vessels, which reflected greater variability in inter-annual spatial use patterns by kayakers.
