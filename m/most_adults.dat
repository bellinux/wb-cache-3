5|$|A few adult beetles may {{overlap between}} {{the spring and}} summer populations, but <b>most</b> <b>adults</b> from the earlier {{emergence}} die before the end of summer. Both adult and larval tansy beetles are unble to detect their host plant, or each other, at a distance, either by smell, sight or a combination of the two. Starvation is thus likely to be a major contributor to mortality when beetles wander away from their host and become lost.|$|E
5|$|Marriage was {{considered}} the normal state for all adult residents of the colony. Most men first married in their mid-twenties and women around age 20. Second marriages were not uncommon, and widows and widowers faced social and economic pressures to remarry. On average, most widows and widowers remarried within {{six months to a}} year. <b>Most</b> <b>adults</b> who reached marriageable age lived into their sixties, so effectively two-thirds of a person's life was spent married.|$|E

5|$|The aquatic larvae {{are found}} {{in a wide variety}} of {{habitats}} such as streams, rivers, lakes, ponds, spring seeps and temporary waters (vernal pools). The larvae of many species use silk to make protective cases, which are often strengthened with gravel, sand, twigs, bitten-off pieces of plants, or other debris. The larvae exhibit various feeding strategies, with different species being predators, leaf shredders, algal grazers, or collectors of particles from the water column and benthos. <b>Most</b> <b>adults</b> have short lives during which they do not feed.|$|E
5|$|Farrar {{admitted}} that the marriage was never ideal. He later said that neither had expressed their love to each other, even at {{the early stages of}} marriage. Farrar recounted that Green seemed to lack the coping skills <b>most</b> <b>adults</b> bring to bear in challenging times; when she went into a rage, she sometimes harmed herself or broke things, and rarely gave any thought to whether she was in private or in public during these episodes. By the early 1990s, Farrar worked long hours away from the home to avoid arguments and what he perceived as his wife's shortcomings as a homemaker. When the couple fought, Green responded by treating the children, especially Tim, as small adults and telling them about what their father had done wrong. Swayed by their mother's opinions about their father, the children began to resent and disobey Farrar, to the point where Timothy and Farrar had physical altercations.|$|E
5|$|Murray cod {{are very}} long-lived, which is {{characteristic}} of many freshwater native fish in Australia. Longevity is a survival strategy in variable Australian environment to ensure that <b>most</b> <b>adults</b> participate {{in at least one}} exceptional spawning and recruitment event, which are often linked to unusually wet La Niña years and may only occur every one or two decades. Murray cod are the most long-lived freshwater native fish in Australia. The oldest Murray cod aged yet was 48 years of age, and the even larger specimens of years past leave little doubt that the species can reach considerably greater ages, of 70 years or more.|$|E

25|$|Kodiak bears {{that have}} {{recently}} left their mothers, at ages 3–5 years, have high mortality rates with only 56% {{of males and}} 89% of females surviving. Most young female bears stay within or near their mother’s home range, while most males move farther away. <b>Most</b> <b>adult</b> sows die of natural causes (56%), while <b>most</b> <b>adult</b> male bears are killed by hunters (91%). The oldest known boar in the wild was 27 years old, and the oldest sow was 35.|$|R

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Han dynasty, {{the land}} tax rate was reduced to one-hundredth, with lost revenue recouped by {{increasing}} the poll and property tax rates. The poll tax for <b>most</b> <b>adults</b> was 120 coins annually, 240 coins for merchants, and 20 coins for minors aged between three and fourteen years. The lower taxable threshold age for minors increased to seven years during the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han (r. 48–33 BC) and onwards. Historian Charles Hucker writes that underreporting of the population by local authorities was deliberate and widespread, since this reduced their tax and labor service obligations rendered to the central government.|$|E
5|$|An enhanced-potency IPV (inactivated polio vaccine) was {{licensed}} in the United States in November 1987, and {{is currently}} the vaccine of choice in the United States. The first dose of polio vaccine is given shortly after birth, usually between 1 and 2 months of age, a second dose is given at 4 months of age. The timing of the third dose depends on the vaccine formulation but should be given between 6 and 18 months of age. A booster vaccination is given at 4 to 6 years of age, {{for a total of}} four doses at or before school entry. In some countries, a fifth vaccination is given during adolescence. Routine vaccination of adults (18 years of age and older) in developed countries is neither necessary nor recommended because <b>most</b> <b>adults</b> are already immune and have a very small risk of exposure to wild poliovirus in their home countries. In 2002, a pentavalent (five-component) combination vaccine (called Pediarix) containing IPV was approved for use in the United States.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, the 1989 NCTM {{standards}} led to curricula which de-emphasized or omitted much of {{what was}} considered to be elementary arithmetic in elementary school, and replaced it with emphasis on topics traditionally studied in college such as algebra, statistics and problem solving, and non-standard computation methods unfamiliar to <b>most</b> <b>adults.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} that children up to the age of twelve years do tend to be in the first two of these stages, adults over the age of sixty-one show considerable variation in displays of qualities of Stages 3 and beyond, <b>most</b> <b>adults</b> remaining in Stage 3 (Synthetic Conventional). Fowler's model has generated some empirical studies, and fuller descriptions of this research (and of these six stages) can be found in Wulff (1991).|$|E

25|$|To {{completely}} {{block the}} uptake of iodine-131 by the purposeful addition of perchlorate ions to a population's water supply, aiming at dosages of 0.5mg/kg-day, or a water concentration of 17 ppm, would therefore be grossly inadequate at truly reducing radioiodine uptake. Perchlorate ion concentrations in a region's water supply would therefore {{need to be}} much higher, {{with at least a}} total dosage of 7.15mg/kg of body weight per day needing to be aimed for, with this being achievable for <b>most</b> <b>adults</b> by consuming 2 liters of water per day with a water concentration of 250mg/kg of water, or 250 ppm of perchlorate ions per liter; only at this level would perchlorate consumption offer adequate protection, and be truly beneficial to the population at preventing bioaccumulation when exposed to a radioiodine environment. This being entirely independent of the availability of iodate or iodide drugs.|$|E
25|$|Adults who {{are members}} of a {{minority}} also have quite high literacy skills in Chinese. <b>Most</b> <b>adults</b> speak several Chinese dialects, and some also speak Li. In old Yacheng City and its vicinity as well as for several dozen miles west of Huihui and Huixin, the so-called military speech (the official language of the southwest among the northern Chinese dialects) is spoken. In Yanglan Village to the northeast, two Min dialects, both closely related to Cantonese, are spoken: the Mai dialect and the Danzhou dialect, spoken in Haipo Village in the south, which is the same dialect as the dialect spoken in Danzhou in Dan Country {{in the northern part of}} the island. From the east to the west along the seashore, the Hainanese dialect is used. In Sanya City itself one sometimes finds speakers of Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} vernacular children's {{songs in}} Europe are lullabies from the later medieval period. From soon {{after we have}} records of short children's rhyming songs, but most nursery rhymes were not written down until the 18th century. The first English collections were Tommy Thumb's Song Book and a sequel, Tommy Thumb's Pretty Song Book, are both {{thought to have been}} published before 1744, and John Newbery's, Mother Goose's Melody, or, Sonnets for the Cradle (c.1785), is the first record we have of many classic rhymes. These rhymes seem to have come from a variety of sources, including traditional riddles, proverbs, ballads, lines of Mummers' plays, drinking songs, historical events, and, it has been suggested, ancient pagan rituals. Roughly half of the current body recognised 'traditional' English rhymes were known by the mid-18th century. From this period we sometimes know the origins and authors of rhymes, like 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star', which combined an 18th-century French tune with a poem by English writer Jane Taylor and 'Mary Had a Little Lamb', written by Sarah Josepha Hale of Boston in 1830. The first, and possibly the most important collection to focus in this area was, James Orchard Halliwell's, The Nursery Rhymes of England (1842) and Popular Rhymes and Tales in 1849. At the height of the revival Sabine Baring-Gould produced A Book of Nursery Songs (1895), and Andrew Lang produced The Nursery Rhyme Book in 1897. Children's songs, unlike folk songs, have remained part of a living and continuous tradition, for although added to from other sources and affected by written versions, <b>most</b> <b>adults</b> pass on songs they learned from oral sources as children.|$|E
