This list collects a group of more than 100 banking institutions which, during the crisis, suffered losses. We explain the probability {{of being part of}} the list (to suffer severe or highly severe losses) by their structure and performance. These aspects are represented by 4 variables: ROA, tier 1 ratio, number of employees and total assets, referred to the two years preceding the crisis, of a larger sample of more than 400 banks comprehending the banks in and outside the list. By considering the heterogeneity among the banks of the list, an explanation of the probability of highly sever losses is offered by considering the previous variables with the addition of interbanking assets.

40|$|Abstract__ Is there a {{link between}} asset prices and {{economic}} fundamentals? Many studies fail to find a convincing link and conclude that asset prices and economic fundamentals are disconnected. A famous example of the disconnect between exchange rates and macroeconomic fundamentals is presented in Meese and Rogoff (1983). The main success connecting asset prices to economic fundamentals is in very short periods immediately after macroeconomic announcements (e. g. Andersen et al., 2007). However, individual announcements are much less important in the medium term. The reason is that <b>medium</b> term <b>returns</b> are contaminated by other types of news (including economic news) unrelated to the news analyzed. Therefore simultaneously relating <b>medium</b> term asset <b>returns</b> to {{a large number of}} economic news announcements can provide means of mitigating contamination. This thesis provides evidence of a strong medium term relation between asset prices and economic fundamentals by using news aggregation and novel methods. While the literature documents that the link between asset prices and economic fundamentals, measured by R-squared, does not exceed eight percent, this thesis shows that the R-squared can be as high as 27 percent...|$|R
40|$|International {{financial}} portfolios can {{be exposed}} to substantial risk from variations of the exchange rates between the countries in which they hold investments. Nonetheless, foreign exchange can both generate extra return as well as loss to a portfolio, hence rather than just being avoided, there are potential advantages to well-managed international portfolios. This paper introduces an optimisation model that manages currency exposure of a portfolio {{through a combination of}} foreign exchange forward contracts, thereby creating a “currency overlay” on top of asset allocation. Crucially, the hedging and transaction costs associated with holding forward contracts are taken into account in the portfolio risk and return calculations. This novel extension of previous overlay models improves the accuracy of the risk and return calculations of portfolios. Consequently, more accurate investment decisions are obtained through optimal asset allocation and hedging positions. Our experimental results show that inclusion of such costs significantly changes the optimal decisions. Furthermore, effects of constraints related to currency hedging are examined. It is shown that tighter constraints weaken the benefit of a currency overlay and that forward positions vary significantly across return targets. A larger currency overlay is advantageous at low and high return targets, whereas small overlay positions are observed at <b>medium</b> <b>return</b> targets. The resulting system can hence enhance intelligent expert decision support for financial managers...|$|R

40|$|High-resolution 23 Na and 39 K nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) spectra of perfused, beating rat hearts have been obtained in the absence and presence of the downfield shift reagent Dy(TTHA) 3 - in the perfusing medium. Evidence indicates that Dy(TTHA) 3 - enters essentially all extracellular spaces but does not enter intracellular spaces. It can thus be used to discriminate the resonances of the ions in these spaces. Experiments supporting this conclusion include interventions that inhibit the Na+/K+ pump such as the inclusion of ouabain in and the exclusion of K+ from the perfusing medium. In each of these experiments, a peak corresponding to intracellular sodium increased in intensity. In the latter experiment, the increase was reversed when the concentration of K+ in the perfusing <b>medium</b> was <b>returned</b> to normal. When the concentration of Ca 2 + in the perfusing <b>medium</b> was also <b>returned</b> to normal, the previously quiescent heart resumed beating.
