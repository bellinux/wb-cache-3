500|$|Both private {{individuals}} and large production companies have used YouTube to grow audiences. Independent content creators have built grassroots followings numbering {{in the thousands}} at very little cost or effort, while <b>mass</b> <b>retail</b> and radio promotion proved problematic. Concurrently, old media celebrities moved into the website {{at the invitation of}} a YouTube management that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial followings, and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television. While YouTube's revenue-sharing [...] "Partner Program" [...] made it possible to earn a substantial living as a video producer—its top five hundred partners each earning more than $100,000 annually and its ten highest-earning channels grossing from $2.5million to $12million—in 2012 CMU business editor characterized YouTube as [...] "a free-to-use... promotional platform for the music labels". In 2013 Forbes Katheryn Thayer asserted that digital-era artists' work must not only be of high quality, but must elicit reactions on the YouTube platform and social media. Videos of the 2.5% of artists categorized as [...] "mega", [...] "mainstream" [...] and [...] "mid-sized" [...] received 90.3% of the relevant views on YouTube and Vevo in that year. By early 2013 Billboard had announced that it was factoring YouTube streaming data into calculation of the Billboard Hot 100 and related genre charts.|$|E

Three years later, Rough Brothers vice president Bruce Rowe left the company, and president Al Reilly bought Rowe’s share in the business. With the boom of large national retailers in the greenhouse industry in the 1990s, Rough Brothers decided to create specialized teams to address {{the specific needs of}} each market segment, including institutional (research and education markets), conservatory (conservatory construction and restoration), commercial (growers and independent retailers), and <b>mass</b> <b>retail</b> (garden centers). Growth within the <b>mass</b> <b>retail</b> sector allowed Rough Brothers to expand their manufacturing shop, including a specialized steel fabrication shop, a fabric shop for signage, and larger shipping and staging areas. Expansions to their Cincinnati, Ohio corporate office facilitated the creation of a specialized <b>mass</b> <b>retail</b> team focused specifically on Home Depot, Lowes, and other retailers.

In-depth interviews were conducted to explore the reasons for consumers’ partial or total defection from <b>mass</b> <b>retailing</b> in Tunisia. Our results identify some unusual motives for rejection of imported hypermarkets due to (i) consumers’ non-adherence to the way these modern food stores put forward consumption as a spectacle resulting in voyeuristic behavior and social marking, and (ii) their religiously inspired culture and education that limits consumption and emphasizes the fairness, human and ethical dimensions of commerce. Our findings extend and enrich knowledge on consumer resistance by pointing out the amazing precocity {{of the emergence of}} this consumers’ opposition to the introduction of foreign retail formats, in an immature retail market, Tunisia for instance, that are deemed not to be congruent with local cultural and religious values...|$|R

40|$|Western firms {{engaged in}} <b>mass</b> <b>retailing</b> and in product {{assembly}} make frequent changes to their global production networks (GPNs). Indeed, some GPNs show {{a tendency to}} hypermobility, which we define as a rapid switching of economic links among manufacturers, importers, and retailers. This theme is explored {{in the context of}} the Canadian bicycle industry where domestic production collapsed between 1980 and 2008, following a century of remarkable stability. After a period of flux when Taiwan was the key player, China has emerged as the dominant original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of bicycles sold in Canada, with big-box stores accounting for the great majority of sales. We connect this increasing fluidity in supply arrangements and in the global organization of the industry with the governance of these GPNs. Several aspects of governance are considered, including the Sloanist practices of the largest Canadian retailers, and the activist role of the Chinese state in directing regional patterns of manufacturing in China...|$|R

50|$|Suzanne Berçot, {{painter and}} fashion illustrator, created the Cours Berçot in 1954 {{on the advice}} of her colleagues at the {{magazine}} Jardin des Modes. Drawing was a rigorous and necessary discipline in the heyday of Haute couture, both for designing and for representing the garment. After several years of close collaboration, in 1971, Madame Berçot entrusted the management of the Establishment to Marie Rucki, a former student who was active in the fashion world. She renamed it Studio Berçot. The decline of Haute Couture and the rise of ready-to-wear during the 1970s developed a large number of new professional activities in the field of fashion. Marie Rucki was highly aware of the constant changes in trends, and organized the curriculum to match the expansion of fashion design. Studio Berçot has become a key pool of talent dedicated to the designers/creators of the 1980s, to the artistic directors in large luxury houses of the 1990s, and to the fashion accessory market in the 2000s when <b>mass</b> <b>retailing</b> internationalized the industry.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to establish the level of importance attached to competitive intelligence (CI) at a <b>mass</b> import <b>retail</b> organization in South Africa. The rationale of CI is to alert an organization about the current situation as it relates to its business environment and competitors, and how these aspects affect the competitive situation. In this article, the value and significance that CI presents to organizations upon implementation are discussed by focusing upon the need for a competitive strategy, the significance of institutionalizing CI, various organizational structure options and the establishment of a CI culture. A survey was conducted at a <b>mass</b> import <b>retail</b> organization to determine the level of importance attached to CI.
