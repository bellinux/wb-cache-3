He had a way he could wrap a melody around odd time signatures and weird parts and make them catchy. He was a beautiful wordsmith. If you look at his lyrics, he obviously was processing his pain and depression, and all of those things. I think that’s part of what people, <b>myself</b> <b>included,</b> responded to when he was singing. With the songwriting he had that voice, there’s not too many people that have that many options with their voice.

He finally fell out with the new Mirror editor, David Banks in March 1993, nearly seventeen months after Maxwell's death. Banks, he claimed, had {{accused him of being}} [...] "mad", and a contemporaneous boardroom coup had introduced, according to Foot, a [...] "systematic campaign of union-busting" [...] at the company. He left the Mirror in 1993 when the paper refused to print articles critical of its new management and placed him on sick leave. [...] "This is Stalinist psychiatry," [...] he said at the time. [...] "If you don't agree with us you must be mad."

I had chiefly been mine own enemy; or, as I may rightly say, I had been nobody's enemy but my own. But now I was embarrassed in the worst condition imaginable; for though I was perfectly innocent, I was in no condition to make that innocence appear: and if I had been taken, it had been under a supposed guilt of the worst kind; at least a crime esteemed so among the people I had to do with.|$|R
2500|$|According to Ignatieff, [...] "what Saddam Hussein {{had done}} to the Kurds and the Shia" [...] in Iraq was {{sufficient}} justification for the invasion. His {{support for the war}} began to wane as time passed. [...] "I supported an administration whose intentions I didn't trust," [...] he averred, [...] "believing that the consequences would repay the gamble. Now I realize that intentions do shape consequences." [...] He eventually recanted his support for the war entirely. In a 2007 New York Times Magazine article, he wrote: [...] "The unfolding catastrophe in Iraq has condemned the political judgment of a president, but it has also condemned the judgment of many others, <b>myself</b> <b>included,</b> who as commentators supported the invasion." [...] Ignatieff partly interpreted what he now saw as his particular errors of judgment, by presenting them as typical of academics and intellectuals in general, whom he characterised as [...] "generalizing and interpreting particular facts as instances of some big idea". In politics, by contrast, [...] "Specifics matter more than generalities".

Some of the essays were originally published in shorter form elsewhere and some original. The over-riding theme of the articles is the absurdity and excessiveness in American life: the book is about luxuries and privileges being treated as deserved rights. Rakoff said that {{the moral of the}} book is that there should be [...] "a little more guilt out there" [...] and [...] "we could all, <b>myself</b> <b>included,</b> count our blessings, acknowledge our privileges." [...] The book was generally praised by critics. The New York Times said, [...] "Rarely have greed, vanity, selfishness, and vapidity been so mercilessly and wittily portrayed". Emily Gordon says that in his [...] "bursts of pure enthusiasm, he's a delectable Cole Porter, Nicholson Baker and Sarah Vowell smoothie". However, Rakoff was criticised in the Washington Post for misusing the word [...] "like", with the reviewer suggesting that Rakoff's prose could use tightening. In The New York Times, Jennifer 8. Lee said the book was [...] "no more than a collection of vaguely related magazine pieces" [...] rather than [...] "a coherent seriocomic manifesto", that some essays were off-theme, and not about narcissism and excess.|$|E

Kirkus Reviews included the novel in its list of best books of 2014, describing it as [...] "Another tour de force from Japan’s greatest living novelist." [...] In {{the review of the}} novel for The New York Times, Patti Smith wrote [...] "This is a book for both the new and experienced reader. It has a strange casualness, as if it unfolded as Murakami wrote it; at times, it seems like a prequel to a whole other narrative... A shedding of Murakami skin. It is not [...] "Blonde on Blonde," [...] it is [...] "Blood on the Tracks." [...] Reviewing the novel for NPR, Meg Wolitzer wrote: [...] "Colorless Tsukuru's mystery is solved before the end, but the mystery of the spell that the great Murakami casts over his readers, <b>myself</b> <b>included,</b> goes, as ever, unsolved. The novel feels like a riddle, a puzzle, or maybe, actually, more like a haiku: full of beauty, strangeness, and color, thousands of syllables long." [...] In the review of the novel for The Washington Post, Marie Arana called it [...] "a deeply affecting novel, not only for the dark nooks and crannies it explores, but for the magic that seeps into its characters’ subconsciouses, for the lengths to which they will go to protect or damage one another, for the brilliant characterizations it delivers along the way... Murakami can herd the troubles of a very large world and still mind a few precious details. He may be taking us deeper and deeper into a fractured modernity and its uneasy inhabitants, but he is ever alert to minds and hearts, to what it is, precisely, that they feel and see, and to humanity’s abiding and indomitable spirit." ...|$|E

While Gehrke-White told the diverse stories of women through an analytical and categorical lens, the editors of I Speak for Myself open up a space for the voices of the contributors and do not attempt to interpret these experiences.
