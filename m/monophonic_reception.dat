It's time for Service Information for the Television Trade.::First, transmitter information concerning Stockland Hill and Beacon Hill: BBC-1 UHF Stockland Hill has been on reduced power since nine o'clock and will continue so for some time this morning. BBC-2 Beacon Hill has also been on reduced power since nine o'clock remaining so for some time today. I'll just repeat those - BBC-1 UHF Stockland Hill has been on reduced power since nine o'clock and will continue so for some time this morning and BBC-2 Beacon Hill has also been on reduced power since nine o'clock remaining so for some time today.::The BBC Wales 625-line Colour Television Service from Preseley Relay Station in Pembrokeshire has now opened. The BBC-2 Service opens tomorrow. Both channels are subject to engineering tests until the full programme service begins on 1 September. Preseley will serve about 89,000 people mostly in Pembrokeshire but including some in the Western parts of Cardiganshire and Carmarthenshire. Group B aerials with horizontal rods are required for receiving the 625-line transmissions from Preseley and they should be directed towards the site of the station which is about nine miles South of Cardigan. Group B aerials are suitable for both BBC channels, 46 that's BBC Wales and 40 for BBC-2 {{as well as the other}} two channels assigned to Preseley 43 for ITV and 50. They should be carefully positioned for optimum reception on the different channels.::Following successful Test Transmissions, the full stereo programme service will be broadcast from the BBC's Holme Moss and Belmont transmitting stations starting tomorrow. Relay Stations at Scarborough, Sheffield, Wensleydale and Windermere will also radiate the stereo programmes. These six stations serve most of Lancashire, Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and parts of adjacent counties and they will bring stereo on Radio One when that's transmitted on VHF, Radio Two and Radio Four to more than eleven and a half million listeners in the North. Radio Three has been transmitted in stereo from Holme Moss for several years but from now on it will use the new pulse code modulation distribution system along with the other programmes giving a consequent improvement in technical quality. This improvement should also be noticeable to listeners with monophonic equipment. At some receiving locations near the limit of the service areas of the transmitting stations concerned the change from monophonic to stereophonic reception may introduce additional background noise and this can often be reduced by using a more efficient aerial system and listeners in these circumstances should seek the advice of their local radio dealer. <b>Monophonic</b> <b>reception</b> of stereophonic transmissions is not affected in this way. ::Well, today is the last day of the trade test colour films which have been transmitted regularly by BBC Television since 1954. But now that there are colour programmes shown on one channel or the other for most of the day the time available for transmission of the test card has been considerably reduced and the need for high quality moving pictures during Trade Tests has diminished. So after consultation with representatives of the Television Trade it's been decided that from next week available time on BBC-2 will mainly be filled by the test card together with Service Information announcements and the Service Information in the afternoons will be at 4:30 instead of 2:30 but will remain at ten o'clock and 11:30 in the mornings. Full details of the new schedule will shortly be published as an information sheet.::Well, today there's more Service Information at half-past eleven and at half-past two this afternoon. And those Colour Films, well the Colour Films being shown in today's Trade Test Transmissions are at eleven-thirty-five Journey Into The Weald Of Kent, at ten-past-twelve Cantagallo, at two-o'clock North Sea Quest, at 2:35 Giuseppina and the last Trade Test Colour Film at 3:30, Coupe Des Alpes. ::At four-thirty instead of the usual Trade Test Colour Film, BBC-2 opens-up with coverage of the second day's play in the third test at Lord's.::Well now the colour test card and music are with us until our first scheduled programme of the day Play School at eleven o'clock".|$|E
