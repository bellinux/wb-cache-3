5|$|The {{manuscript}} today comprises 340 folios and, since 1953, {{has been}} bound in four volumes. The leaves are on high-quality calf vellum, and the unprecedentedly elaborate ornamentation that covers them includes ten full-page illustrations and text pages that are vibrant with decorated initials and interlinear miniatures and mark the furthest {{extension of the}} anti-classical and energetic qualities of Insular art. The Insular <b>majuscule</b> script of the text itself {{appears to be the}} work of at least three different scribes. The lettering is in iron gall ink, and the colours used were derived {{from a wide range of}} substances, many of which were imports from distant lands.|$|E
5|$|The <b>majuscule</b> letters have elegant shape, but {{a little}} less simple {{than those in the}} Sinaiticus and Vaticanus codices. These letters, {{at the end of a}} line, are often very small, and much of the writing is very pale and faint. Punctuation is more frequent, usually on a level with the top of the {{preceding}} letter, while a vacant space, proportionate to the break in the sense, follows the end of a paragraph. At the end of each book the colophon is ornamented by pretty volutes from prima manu. There are found the Ammonian Sections with references to the Eusebian Canons stand in the margin of the text of the Gospels. It contains divisions into larger sections – κεφάλαια, the headings of these sections (τίτλοι) stand at the top of the pages. The places at which those sections commence are indicated throughout the Gospels, and in Luke and John their numbers are placed in the margin of each column. To all the Gospels (except Matthew, because of lacunae) is prefixed by a table of κεφάλαια (table of contents).|$|E
5000|$|Typographically, {{the basic}} {{difference}} between the <b>majuscules</b> and minuscules {{is not that the}} <b>majuscules</b> are big and minuscules small, but that the <b>majuscules</b> generally have the same height (although, depending on the typeface, there may be some exceptions, particularly with Q and sometimes J having a descending element; also, various diacritics can add to the normal height of a letter).|$|R

5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{is written}} primarily in insular <b>majuscule</b> with some occurrences of minuscule letters (usually e or s). The text is usually written in one long line across the page. Françoise Henry identified {{at least three}} scribes in this manuscript, whom she named Hand A, Hand B, and Hand C. Hand A is found on folios 1 through 19v, folios 276 through 289, and folios 307 {{through the end of}} the manuscript. Hand A, for the most part, writes eighteen or nineteen lines per page in the brown gall-ink common throughout the West. Hand B is found on folios 19r through 26 and folios 124 through 128. Hand B has a somewhat greater tendency to use minuscule and uses red, purple and black ink and a variable number of lines per page. Hand C is found throughout the majority of the text. Hand C also has greater tendency to use minuscule than Hand A. Hand C uses the same brownish gall-ink used by hand A and wrote, almost always, seventeen lines per page.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Kells {{contains}} the four Gospels of the Christian scriptures written in black, red, purple, and yellow ink in an insular <b>majuscule</b> script, preceded by prefaces, summaries, and concordances of Gospel passages. Today, {{it consists of}} 340 vellum leaves, or folios. The majority of the folios are part of larger sheets, called bifolios, which are folded in half to form two folios. The bifolios are nested inside {{of each other and}} sewn together to form gatherings called quires. On occasion, a folio is not part of a bifolio but is instead a single sheet inserted within a quire. The extant folios are gathered into 38 quires. There are between four and twelve folios (two to six bifolios) per quire; the folios are commonly, but not invariably, bound in groups of ten. Some folios are single sheets, as is frequently the case with the important decorated pages. The folios had lines drawn for the text, sometimes on both sides, after the bifolios were folded. Prick marks and guide lines can still be seen on some pages. The vellum is of high quality, although the folios have an uneven thickness, with some being close to leather while others are so thin as to be almost translucent.|$|E
25|$|Another {{convention}} {{used by a}} few authors {{is to use a}} <b>majuscule</b> (capital/upper-case) {{first letter}} along with a 1 superscript, e.g., , , , etc., which avoids confusing them with the multiplicative inverse, which should be represented by , , etc.|$|E

25|$|Taxonomic {{names are}} written in italics (or {{underlined}} when handwritten) with a <b>majuscule</b> first letter {{with the exception of}} epithets for species and subspecies. Despite it being common in zoology, tautonyms (e.g. Bison bison) are not acceptable and names of taxa used in zoology, botany or mycology cannot be reused for Bacteria (Botany and Zoology do share names).|$|E
25|$|If no ß is available, ss or sz is {{used instead}} (sz {{especially}} in Hungarian-influenced eastern Austria). This applies especially to all caps or small caps texts because ß had no generally accepted <b>majuscule</b> form until 2017. Excepted are all-caps names in legal documents; they may retain an ß to prevent ambiguity (for instance: STRAßER, since Straßer and Strasser are both possible names).|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the Roman Empire (5th century AD), several {{variants}} of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe. Among these were the semicursive minuscule of Italy, the Merovingian script in France, the Visigothic script in Spain, and the Insular or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon <b>majuscule</b> of Great Britain. By the 9th century, the Caroline script, which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. This form was derived through a combining of prior forms.|$|E
25|$|The {{handwriting}} {{found in}} New Testament manuscripts varies. One way of classifying handwriting is by formality: book-hand vs. cursive. More formal, literary Greek works were often {{written in a}} distinctive style of even, capital letters called book-hand. Less formal writing consisted of cursive letters which could be written quickly. Another way of dividing handwriting is between uncial script (or <b>majuscule)</b> and minuscule. The uncial letters were a consistent height between the baseline and the cap height, while the minuscule letters had ascenders and descenders that moved past the baseline and cap height. Generally speaking, the majuscules are earlier than the minuscules, with a dividing line roughly in the 11th century.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{forms of}} the letters in antiquity are <b>majuscule</b> forms. Besides the upright, {{straight}} inscriptional forms (capitals) found in stone carvings or incised pottery, more fluent writing styles adapted for handwriting on soft materials were also developed during antiquity. Such handwriting has been preserved especially from papyrus manuscripts in Egypt since the Hellenistic period. Ancient handwriting developed two distinct styles: uncial writing, with carefully drawn, rounded block letters of about equal size, used as a book hand for carefully produced literary and religious manuscripts, and cursive writing, used for everyday purposes. The cursive forms approached the style of lowercase letter forms, with ascenders and descenders, {{as well as many}} connecting lines and ligatures between letters.|$|E

25|$|Carmina Burana (abbreviated CB) is a {{manuscript}} written in 1230 by two different scribes {{in an early}} gothic minuscule (small letters; what is today called lower-case, as opposed to <b>majuscule</b> – large, capital, upper-case, used in Roman manuscripts) on 119 sheets of parchment. In the 14th century, a number of free pages, cut of a slightly different size, were attached {{at the end of}} the text. At some point in the Late Middle Ages the handwritten pages were bound into a small folder, called the Codex Buranus. However, in the process of binding, the text was placed partially out of order, and some pages were most likely lost as well. The manuscript contains eight miniatures: the rota fortunae (which actually is an illustration from the songs CB 14–18, but was placed by the book binder as the cover), an imaginative forest, a pair of lovers, scenes from the story of Dido and Aeneas, a scene of drinking beer, and three scenes of playing games – dice, tables, and chess.|$|E

500|$|... "TYΜ.ωΘΕΟC" [...] was {{interpreted}} in 1857 by Charles Eastlake as [...] "Timotheos", a proper name. Campbell {{points out that}} vanEyck [...] "appears to have employed the Greek alphabet systematically", and always employed the square sigma C for the Latin [...] "S", and a <b>majuscule</b> omega ω (in the uncial form) for the Latin [...] "O". The inscription may be meant to read [...] "Honour God", or [...] "Be Honoured, OGod", as written in the passive imperative. Panofsky gives some consideration to {{the hypothesis that the}} final letter is a [...] "N", and that the lettering forms two words rather than one. In this interpretation, the letters spell TYΜω ΘΕΟN, meaning [...] "Honour God". While this would be more straightforward than [...] "Timotheus", he rejects the possibility. He writes that [...] "the presence of a shorter horizontal line connecting with the slightly tapering top of the vertical stroke and completing it into a Γ form... evidently precludes a [...] "N". Dhanens suggests the inscription can be read as [...] "Time Deum" [...] ("Fear God"), a known motto of the Vilain family.|$|E

2500|$|It must {{be noted}} that the proper phonemic {{transcription}} is /N/, which is a non-standard, but widely used IPA symbol for a homorganic nasal. Similarly to /Q/, the common symbol for a homorganic obstruent. There is an increasing tendency across many linguistic media (Wikipedia included) to substitute the IPA symbol [...] (small <b>majuscule</b> n) which is the symbol for the uvular nasal, a sound which does not exist in Burmese. This is largely due to the rarity of /ɴ/ across languages {{and the fact that the}} use of a small <b>majuscule</b> makes transcription easier to read. Note that other languages with homorganic nasals, such as Japanese, also use intermittent /ɴ/ in transcription. Nevertheless, the use of ⟨ɴ⟩ in Burmese transcription, though common and easy to read, is incorrect.|$|E
