40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{characterization}} of low frequency sound transmission between two rooms via a flexible panel. A fully-coupled modal model is used to investigate the individual effect of the source <b>room</b> and the <b>receiving</b> <b>room</b> on the measured sound reduction index, {{and the results are}} compared with the ideal case of having a free field {{on both sides of the}} panel. The effect of the source room on the measured sound reduction index at low frequencies can be reduced by using a number of suitable-driven loudspeakers close to the panel to simulate a diffuse incident field. However, the effect of the <b>receiving</b> <b>room</b> was found not to be reduced by calculating the transmitted acoustic power from a dense array of acoustic intensity measurements, instead of an array of microphones in the <b>receiving</b> <b>room...</b>|$|R

40|$|Although the {{reliability}} on the measurement results of floor impact sound is important, high large variation of reverberation time in <b>receiving</b> <b>rooms</b> {{might result in}} high uncertainty at the low frequencies. Reverberation time at low frequencies {{is influenced by the}} arrangement of furniture and position in the <b>receiving</b> <b>room.</b> In this study, the effect of furniture arrangements on reverberation time in a <b>receiving</b> <b>room</b> was investigated in the apartment buildings. Heavy-weight impact sounds level generated by bang machine and impact ball were measured to estimate the effect of furniture arrangement. The results show that the standard deviation was relatively greater at 63 Hz frequency band. Small variance at 63 Hz was measured in terms of furniture arrangements. Variation of the measured single number rating of Li,Fmax, AW ranged from 1 to 4 dB according to the absorption power of furniture. The reasonable number of measurements was suggested based on the uncertainties of reverberation time at 63 to 500 Hz...|$|R
40|$|Sound level {{difference}} between two rooms depends on both sound reduction between the rooms and their acoustical properties, {{such as the}} absorption in the <b>receiving</b> <b>room.</b> In order to abstract {{the influence of the}} rooms and assess only the sound reduction between them, relevant building acoustics standards offer two ways of normalizing a measured sound {{level difference}} – according to the reverberation time and the equivalent sound absorption area in the <b>receiving</b> <b>room.</b> In both cases measurement procedure requires reverberation time measurements in the <b>receiving</b> <b>room,</b> from which the equivalent sound absorption area can be assessed using Sabine’s formula. This paper analyses more than 300 results of reverberation time field measurements and provides an insight into its typical values in buildings.

This can be done using a large number of audio channels and performing rendering using wavefield synthesis techniques. Nowadays, an acoustic opening can be built using standard audio components.

40|$|The {{impact sound}} {{insulation}} quality of floors is vital for the acoustic comfort in buildings. Although {{impact sound insulation}} can be experimentally assessed, a numerical prediction tool is important for design and optimization purposes. The development of such a prediction tool is challenging, because of the difficulties in predicting the impact force and the dynamic response of building elements, the quantification of the sound radiation from the floor, and coupling effects between the floor {{and other parts of}} the building. In this contribution, the impact force produced by a tapping machine is predicted by a conventional impact model. To predict the impact sound radiation at medium and high frequencies, a decoupled hybrid approach is developed to model the floor and the <b>receiving</b> <b>room.</b> The floor is deterministically modeled with finite elements (FE) and the radiated sound power is obtained by integrating the sound intensity over the vibrating floor surface. The <b>receiving</b> <b>room</b> is modeled as a pure-tone diffuse reverberant field using statistic energy analysis (SEA), and the sound pressure level in the room is then determined by a rigorous power balance within the decoupled floor-room system. This approach is applied to predict the impact sound level in a <b>receiving</b> <b>room</b> under a concrete floor, and the result shows good agreement with measurements at medium and high frequencies. status: publishe...|$|R

Significant correlation between milk yield and weight gain of calves to weaning was reported for different cattle breed.|$|R
