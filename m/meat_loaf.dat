5|$|P. R. Brown {{directed}} this video, which premiered on VH1 Classic on 8 August 2006. There are {{similarities between}} the video for Meat Loaf's version of the song, and that the video for that of Celine Dion, with <b>Meat</b> <b>Loaf</b> being haunted {{by the memory of}} his lover. It is structured differently, however, with the story being told through flashback. Shots when Raven's character is alive have a distinct yellow tint, with a darker, blue tint for those after her death. Whereas the motorcyclist dies before the first verse in the Dion version, Raven's crash and resulting death is not shown until the final chorus. <b>Meat</b> <b>Loaf</b> becomes angry with Raven because the ghost of Raven's former lover appears at a masquerade ball they are attending (some reviewers have compared this to the Stanley Kubrick film Eyes Wide Shut).|$|E

5|$|And by {{the time}} they got it all {{organized}} and figured out, there were really only a couple of songs left for me to do anything on. So I came into L.A. for a couple of days and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, maybe <b>Meat</b> <b>Loaf,</b> said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E

Ground goat meat and beef with 15 % target fat content were produced using primal cuts of goat meat and beef chuck roasts obtained at 24 hours and ~ 7 days postmortem, respectively, and analyzed for total fat, moistures total and nowhere irons 2 -thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), and peroxide value (PV). Beef was found to be higher than goat meat only in total and heme iron contents. Ground goat meat and beef were then prepared as plain <b>meat</b> <b>loaves</b> cooked to an internal temperature of ~ 74 ?C or as chili using stir-fried and drained meat. Day- 0 goat <b>meat</b> and beef <b>loaves</b> were not different in fat or moisture contents. Day- 0 chili was not different in fat, but was different in moisture, most likely due to variable rates of moisture loss during cooking. Total, heme, and nowhere iron contents were higher for beef than goat <b>meat</b> <b>loaves.</b> Consumer panelists rated flavor intensity of goat <b>meat</b> and beef <b>loaves</b> similarly. Goat <b>meat</b> served after beef was scored lower in overall acceptability than beef served after goat meat. Consumers were able to differentiate goat meat and beer whether prepared as plain <b>meat</b> <b>loaves</b> or chili. When cooked plain goat <b>meat</b> <b>loaves</b> were aerobically stored at 4 ?C for 3 or 6 days and evaluated by a trained sensory panel, only the ("cardboard" and "painty" aromatic intensity scores were found to increase over storage days, with "cooked goat meat/brothy'' intensity scores decreasing. TBARS values for chili, whether goat meat or beer were much lower than the values for the plain <b>meat</b> <b>loaves</b> and remained low throughout 6 day storage at 4 ?C. PV increased with storage time for both goat <b>meat</b> and beef <b>loaves.</b> Storage had little effect on PV of goat meat chili. Nonheme iron content of goat <b>meat</b> <b>loaves</b> significantly increased over storage days...|$|R
