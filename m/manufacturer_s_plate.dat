40|$|Vibration {{measurements}} at {{the workplace}} are often complicated and expensive. The {{assessment of the}} risk in conformity with EC Directive 2002 / 44 /EC Vibration (which lays down the minimum requirements of laws in Europe for occupational safety and health) can therefore be carried out {{on the basis of}} an estimate based on information from manufacturers as well as by measurement conforming to ISO 5349. The characteristic values (emission values) determined by manufacturers in laboratory conditions may deviate from the exposure values measured at source at the workplace. Equally, deviations may arise {{as a result of the}} delay in the changeover of test methods from the single axis of measurement to the total vibration value for the three axes of measurement conforming to ISO 20643. To prevent faulty estimates, the <b>manufacturer</b> <b>s</b> information has to be corrected by a tool-related factor in accordance with CEN/TR 15350. By taking the example of masonry and stone working machines, the empirically determined tool-related correction factor is checked and confirmed. Methods Vibration measurements were carried out in accordance with ISO 5349 in practical application conditions on 10 selected typical eccentric and orbital sanders, concrete and disc grinders as well as on wall chasers and stone saws. Results The total vibration value obtained for the investigated tools rangedfrom ahv = 3. 6 m/s to ahv = 11. 6 m/s. When the values from the practical measurements are compared with the <b>manufacturer</b> <b>s</b> vibration values, the underestimation of the risk occurring in some cases can be largely compensated for by the tool-related factors conforming to CEN/TR 15350 (see Figure 1) ...|$|R

40|$|Results are {{presented}} for unidirectional (0, 10) (sub s) and (90, 10) (sub <b>s)</b> <b>plates,</b> ((0 / 90) (sub 5) (sub <b>s))</b> <b>plates,</b> and for aluminum plates. Results are also presented for ((+/- theta) (sub 6) (sub <b>s))</b> angle-ply <b>plates</b> for values of theta = 30, 45, and 60 degrees. The {{results indicate that}} the change in axial stiffness of a plate at buckling is strongly dependent upon cutout size and plate orthotropy. The presence of a cutout gives rise to an internal load distribution that changes, sometimes dramatically, as a function of cutout size coupled with the plate orthotropy. In the buckled state, the role of orthotropy becomes more significant since bending in addition to membrane orthotropy is present. Most of the plates with cutouts exhibited less postbuckling stiffness than the corresponding plate without a cutout, and the postbuckling stiffness decreased with increasing cutout size. However, some of the highly orthotropic plates with cutouts exhibited more postbuckling stiffness than the corresponding plate without a cutout. These results suggest the possibility of tailoring the cutout size and the stacking sequence of a composite plate to optimize postbuckling stiffness. It was found that plates with large radius cutouts do exhibit some postbuckling strength. The results also indicate that a cutout can influence modal interaction in a plate. Specifically, results {{are presented}} that show a plate with a relatively small cutout buckling at a higher load than the corresponding plate without a cutout, due to modal interaction. Other results are presented that indicate the presence of nonlinear prebuckling deformations, due to material nonlinearity, in the angle-ply plates with theta = 45 and 60 degrees. The nonlinear prebuckling deformations are more pronounced in the plates with theta = 45 degrees and become even more pronounced as the cutout size increases. Results are also presented that show how load-path eccentricity due to improper machining of the test specimens affects the buckling behavior. Some of the plates with cutouts and eccentricity exhibited a snap-through type of buckling behavior...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1980 s, the {{diffusion}} of Just-In-Time (JIT) manufacturing from Japanese <b>manufacturers</b> to U. <b>S.</b> <b>manufacturers</b> has progressed at an accelerated rate. At {{this stage of the}} diffusion process, JIT implementations are more common and more advanced in large U. <b>S.</b> <b>manufacturers</b> than in small; consequently, U. S. businessmen's understanding of issues associated with JIT implementations in large manufacturers is more developed than that of small manufacturers. When small manufacturers represent about 96 percent of all U. <b>S.</b> <b>manufacturers,</b> investigation of JIT implementations in small, as well as large, manufacturers is warranted. This survey study investigates JIT implementation differences between small and large U. <b>S.</b> <b>manufacturers.</b> Ten management practices that constitute the JIT concept are used to examine implementation of JIT manufacturing systems. Odds ratio were constructed to determine if an association exists between implemented versus not implemented and manufacturer size for each JIT practice. Ten changes in performance attributed to JIT implementation are also assessed and examined in the study. Logistic regression models are used to examine the relationships between implementation status of each of the JIT practices and of each of the changes in performance in small and large manufacturers. The results of the study show that the frequencies of the 10 JIT management practices implemented differ between the two groups of manufacturer size, and an association exists between the JIT practices implemented and manufacturer size. Moreover, the changes in performance attributed to JIT implementation vary, depending on implementation status of specific JIT management practices and manufacturer size. empirical study, just-in-time manufacturing, performance, manufacturer size, logistic regression...|$|R
