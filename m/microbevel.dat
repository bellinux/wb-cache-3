40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of microbevel-shape of the knife, the amount of a gap caused by {{repairing}} botton surface, deformity of the bottom surface, and horizontal mouth opening on the occurrence of torn grain, surface quality of the workpiece, and chip discharge in planing of wood with a Japanese hand plane without a cap iron were investigated. The knife with a <b>microbevel</b> length (ℓR) and a <b>microbevel</b> angle (βR) was grinded, and its knife was equipped in the plane for this test. The depth of cut (t) was about 0. 05 mm. The <b>microbevel</b> angle (βR) was changed from 0 ° (conventional knife) to 60 ° and the <b>microbevel</b> length (ℓR) was changed from 0. 0 mm (conventional knife) to 0. 9 mm. The materials used for this test were sugi (Cryptomeria japonica), hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtusa), white seraya (Parashorea malaanonan), and agathis (Agathissp.) in air-dry condition. Each material was plained against the grain or with the grain, at the grain angle (φ 1) of about 3 °. The results obtained were summarized in Figs. 6 ～ 13 and Tables 8 and 9. Using these results, characteristics of the wood-planing with a hand plane without a cap iron are discussed, comparing it with the wood-planing with a hand plane with a cap iron...|$|E
40|$|In {{the wood}} cutting process {{with a knife}} {{equipped}} with a chip guide, {{it is important to}} obtain the optimum conditions of the <b>microbevel</b> angle of the knife (β 1), the length of the rake face of the knife with the <b>microbevel</b> (ℓR),and the horizontal mouth opening (h) and to investigate the changes of cutting force acting on the knife and on the chip guide with β 1, ℓR, h, and the grain angle (φ 1 (Figs, 1 ～ 3, and Table 1). In order to obtain quantitative information on them, the basic orthogonal cutting tests, in which the materials used were air-dried wood boards of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla SARG.), were performed using the knife as shown in Fig. 3 (Figs. 4 and 5, and Table 2). The main results obtained are summarized as follows : The roughness of machined surface is affected by β 1, ℓR, and h, as illustrated in Figs. 7 (a) and (b), 9 (a) and (b), and 11 (a) and (b). On the basis of these results, the other results on the cutting phenomena, and the results on the cutting- force components (Figs. 6, 8, and 10), the optimum cutting condition is β 1 ≒ 55. 0 °, ℓR ≒ 0. 35 ～ 0. 40 mm, and h ≒ 0. 60 ～ 1. 20 mm, under cutting angle of the knife (θ) of 35 ° and depth of cut (t) at 0. 3 mm...|$|E
