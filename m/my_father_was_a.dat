500|$|Seacole {{was proud}} of both her Jamaican and Scottish ancestry and called herself a Creole, a term that was {{commonly}} used in a racially neutral sense or {{to refer to the}} children of white settlers with indigenous women. In her autobiography, The Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole, she records her bloodline thus: [...] "I am a Creole, and have good Scots blood coursing through my veins. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> soldier of an old Scottish family." [...] Legally, she was classified as a mulatto, a multiracial person with limited political rights; Robinson speculates that she may technically have been a quadroon. Seacole emphasises her personal vigour in her autobiography, distancing herself from the contemporary stereotype of the [...] "lazy Creole", She {{was proud of}} her black ancestry, writing, [...] "I have a few shades of deeper brown upon my skin which shows me related – and I am proud of the relationship – to those poor mortals whom you once held enslaved, and whose bodies America still owns." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Kaminsky, much of Huston's vision {{probably}} {{came from}} his early experience as a painter {{on the streets of}} Paris. While there, he studied art and worked at it {{for a year and a}} half. Huston continued painting as a hobby for most of his life. Kaminsky also notes that most of Huston's films [...] "reflected this prime interest in the image, the moving portrait and the use of color." [...] Huston explored the use of [...] "stylistic framing", especially well-planned close-ups, in much of his directing. In his first film, The Maltese Falcon, for instance, Huston sketched out all of his scenes beforehand, [...] "like canvases of paintings". His daughter, Anjelica Huston adds that even for his subsequent films, he sketched storyboards [...] "constantly". She agrees that for her father, [...] "it was a form of study, and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> painter, a very good one." [...] She also notes that [...] "there was an extremely developed sensory quality about my father, he didn't miss a trick." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reese {{was born}} in Sweetwater, Nebraska, and died in Santa Maria, California. [...] He went to school in Nebraska and Kansas. [...] "I was the eldest of six {{children}} of a very poor couple. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> horse breaker and former cavalryman; my mother {{was the daughter of}} a frontier blacksmith and woodworker. I may be the last professional writer who talked to those survivors of the 1880s and 1890s and {{who grew up in the}} same environment. It was a specialized education for one job alone, the one I have." [...] He married Margaret Smith in 1938, was divorced, and married Norma Spivack in 1962. [...] Altogether he had seven children, one of whom was adopted. [...] In addition to writing, John H. Reese worked for the U.S. Department of Internal Revenue and as a reporter for the Los Angeles Examiner in California and as a free-lance for newspapers in Mexico. His first Western novel was Signal Guns at Sunup written under the pseudonym of John Jo Carpenter. He is survived by his great granddaughter Kim who is also a published author.|$|E

2500|$|In 1956, Robeson {{was called}} before HUAC after {{he refused to}} sign an {{affidavit}} affirming {{that he was not}} a Communist. In his testimony, he invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to reveal his political affiliations. When asked why he had not remained in the Soviet Union because of his affinity with its political ideology, he replied, [...] "because <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> slave and my people died to build , I am going to stay here, and have a part of it just like you and no fascist-minded people will drive me from it!" [...] At that hearing, Robeson stated [...] "Whether I am or not a Communist is irrelevant. The question is whether American citizens, regardless of their political beliefs or sympathies, may enjoy their constitutional rights." [...] Robeson's passport was subsequently revoked. Campaigns were launched to protest the passport ban and the restriction of his right to travel over the next four years, but it was to no avail. In 1957, unable to accept invitations to perform abroad, Paul Robeson sang for audiences in London, where 1,000 concert tickets for his telephone concert at St Pancras Town Hall sold out within an hour, and Wales via the transatlantic telephone cable TAT-1: [...] "We have to learn the hard way that there is another way to sing".|$|E
2500|$|Zhirinovsky has {{expressed}} {{admiration for the}} 1996 United States presidential election contender Pat Buchanan, referring positively to a comment in which Buchanan labeled the United States Congress [...] "Israeli-occupied territory." [...] Zhirinovsky said that both countries were [...] "under occupation." [...] and that [...] "to survive, we could set aside places on U.S. and Russian territories to deport this small but troublesome tribe." [...] Buchanan strongly rejected this endorsement, saying he would provide safe haven to persecuted minorities if Zhirinovsky were ever elected Russia's president, eliciting a harsh response by Zhirinovsky: [...] "You soiled your pants {{as soon as you}} got my congratulations. Who are you afraid of: Zionists?" [...] Zhirinovsky repeatedly denied his father's Jewishness until he published Ivan Close Your Soul in July 2001, describing how his father, Volf Isaakovich Eidelshtein, changed his surname from Eidelshtein to Zhirinovsky. He rhetorically asked, [...] "Why should I reject Russian blood, Russian culture, Russian land, and {{fall in love with the}} Jewish people only because of that single drop of blood that my father left in my mother's body?" [...] Another frequently cited quote from Zhirinovsky is [...] "My mother was Russian and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> lawyer". Zhirinovsky later disowned the statement, after researching his father's life in Israel (where, after leaving Zhrinovsky's mother, he had immigrated in 1949 with a new wife, and worked as an agronomist in Tel Aviv). Discussing the statement, Zhirinovsky says: [...] "Journalists mocked me: for saying I was the son of a lawyer. And I am really the son of an agronomist." [...] Discussing his father, Zhirinovsky says with tears in his eyes: [...] "All my life I was looking for him. I believed that he was alive. I believed that someday he would find me... But there is a silver lining. I tried to imitate him... And I was able to achieve a certain position in life, even without the support of my father." ...|$|E
