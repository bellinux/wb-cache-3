5|$|There are few {{compound}} words, {{but lots}} of derivations. The grammar employs a mixture of head and dependent marking: both agent and patient are <b>marked</b> <b>on</b> the predicate and the possessor is <b>marked</b> <b>on</b> nouns, while dependent noun phrases inflect for case. The morphosyntactic alignment of Kalaallisut is ergative.|$|E

Numbers aligned with the marks give the approximate value of the product, quotient, or other calculated result.|$|R

In1935, the road was paved {{to the east of}} Iuka. The paved portion was extended slightly west of Iuka in1936 and further west by1938. By1939, the section of US72 that would be redesignated as MS172 was fully paved. In1986, US72 was moved to a new divided highway alignment to the south through Tishomingo County. By1998, MS172 was <b>marked</b> <b>on</b> the former two-lane alignment of US72 in Tishomingo County.|$|E

Several ancient stones can be seen, such as the Triscombe Stone and the Long Stone above Holford. Many of the tracks along ridges of the Quantocks probably originated as ancient ridgeways.

5|$|Ottawa distinguishes {{two types}} of {{grammatical}} third person in sentences, <b>marked</b> <b>on</b> both verbs and animate nouns. The proximate form indicates a more salient noun phrase, and obviative indicates a less prominent noun phrase. Selection and use of proximate or obviative forms is a distinctive aspect of Ottawa syntax that indicates the relative discourse prominence of noun phrases containing third persons; {{it does not have}} a direct analogue in English grammar.|$|E

However, no highways were <b>marked</b> <b>on</b> Christopher Saxton's map of Derbyshire, published in 1579. Bridge-building improved the transport network. A surviving early example is the three-arched gritstone bridge over the River Derwent at Baslow, which dates from 1608 and has an adjacent toll-shelter.|$|E
5|$|Several common {{birds in}} North America, {{such as the}} house sparrow, the rock pigeon, the European {{starling}} and the mute swan are introduced species, meaning {{that they are not}} native to this continent but were brought here by humans from Europe or elsewhere. Introduced species are <b>marked</b> <b>on</b> this list as (I). There may be species that have individual escapees or small feral populations in North America that are not on this list.

It would remain under local control {{until the first}} quarter-mile (0.4km) section was transferred to state control on September 18, 1978.

5|$|A {{stationary}} front is a non-moving boundary between two different air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other. They tend to remain in the same area for long periods of time, usually moving in waves. There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherms. A wide variety of weather can be found along a {{stationary front}}, but usually clouds and prolonged precipitation are found there. Stationary fronts will either dissipate after several days or devolve into shear lines, but can change into a cold or warm front if conditions aloft change causing a driving of one air mass or the other. Stationary fronts are <b>marked</b> <b>on</b> weather maps with alternating red half-circles and blue spikes pointing in opposite directions, indicating no significant movement.|$|E

US 98 was moved to a new alignment to bypass Lucedale in 1988. In 1996, US 98 was routed out of Beaumont and McLain {{as a result of the}} construction of a new alignment on a divided highway. By1998, MS198 was <b>marked</b> <b>on</b> the six former alignments of US 98 in Tylertown, Columbia, Hattiesburg, Beaumont, McLain, and Lucedale.

Route 103 was first numbered on the 1929 Illinois highway map. The western terminus of Route 103 was moved from Ripley to its current location in 1932, and the western half of the highway moved northward to its present alignment. The community of Layton, which was near the present location of Sugar Grove, was marked along the route until 1951.|$|E
