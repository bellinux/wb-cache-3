5000|$|The 12X was {{equipped}} with newly developed GEALAIF final drives, where GEA refers to AEG, and LAIF stands for Lokomotiv-Antrieb mit integriertem Fahrmotor (locomotive final drive with integrated traction motor). The <b>motor</b> <b>axle</b> {{is connected to the}} pinion axle of the final drive by a diaphragm coupling that is rotationally and radially rigid but bends softly. The main innovation of the GEAALAIF concept is that the pinion axle is supported by bearings on both sides rather than just on the engine side. This solution reduces bending moments on both the pinion axle and the connected <b>motor</b> <b>axle,</b> thus allowing for the size and mass reduction of both. [...] The integration of final drive and motor also included the reversion of the flow of the forced-air cooling, with the cold air passing down on the final drive side of the engine to cool the pinion, too. [...] The final drive drives the wheelset by way of a Cardan shaft, forming a hollow shaft drive.|$|E
5000|$|In January 1920, Beechler and F. C. Gilbert co-founded the Vulcan <b>Motor</b> <b>Axle</b> Co. {{to build}} a {{complete}} line of axles for automobiles. Beechler served as the company's chief engineer. [...] At {{the time of the}} 1920 United States Census, he was working as a mechanical engineer for an axle company in Detroit. He was living in Detroit with his wife Margaret and their two sons, Jack and Richard. By 1930, Beechler and his family had moved to Jackson, Michigan, where Beechler was employed as a mechanical engineer with a horn and radio corporation.|$|E
5000|$|The D-type is articulated, {{consisting}} of three car body sections, sequentially labeled A, B and C, carried on four trucks. All four trucks are powered by one [...] motor each. Two trucks {{are placed on}} kingpins near {{the ends of the}} A and C sections and don't have contact shoes. The other two trucks are placed beneath each of the articulation drums that attach the center B section to the A and C sections. These trucks have contact shoes. The wheel diameter varies with the type of axle: the <b>motor</b> <b>axle</b> wheels are 34 in in diameter while the trailer axle wheels are just 31 in in diameter. The D-types were the first articulated rapid transit rolling stock used in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|DAC 318ET; A {{trolleybus}} with 2 motors TN 76 - 125 kW and 2 <b>motor</b> <b>axles,</b> {{one behind}} {{and one in}} the front of the articulation. Only built as prototype. 18 meters long, 200 passengers. Top speed 60 km/h.|$|R
50|$|Pennsylvania Railroad O1b - 2 Stk 2'Bo2' locomotives. Built with {{inside frame}} and two driving <b>motors</b> per <b>axle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The motor {{design is}} a {{hermetically}} sealed simple co-axial gearless synchronous motor (a permanent magnet, three phase drive, passively cooled design); the motors {{can also be}} used for electrical dynamic braking, and also as an active electric brake. The wheelset bearings are mounted {{on the inside of the}} wheels and support both <b>motor,</b> <b>axles</b> and wheel. A traction link from motor to the vehicle frame transmits tractive forces.|$|R
50|$|Obtaining a DC supply {{controlled}} by rectifiers requires an AC power source. Consequently, the existing auxiliary generator was {{converted to a}} three-phase alternator with automatic voltage regulator. This arrangement gives improved control of traction current over conventional rheostatic systems and gives fine control when starting a train. Normally the driver has to maintain tractive effort well below the rail adhesion limit to give himself time to respond to wheel slip. The constant current systems of Class 74 were designed to allow the driver to apply power very near the limit of adhesion and the booster output is regulated {{in such a way}} that the maximum current of any traction motor group does not exceed the selected value. Thus, even when one <b>motor</b> (<b>axle,</b> wheel set) starts slipping, the voltage across the whole group of motors cannot rise because current in the non-slipping motors is fixed. As one motor begins to slip, its current consumption drops (electric motors use greatest current when stalled and least while free-running) which provides more current for the non-slipping motor (The current for the group is fixed and therefore shared across the motors in the group). The voltage drops proportionately and the slipping motor now partly deprived of power, begins to slow, the slip stops and everything returns to the state it was in before slip set in. Simply speaking the motors all work as a differentially balanced team so that as one motor begins to slip, the others act to balance everything which reduces the speed of the slipping motor almost 'by magic', but maintains torque at a point just below friction break-away. Recovery of wheel slip (providing the driver is not in-attentive or deliberately attempting to slip) is very rapid. It is this system that allowed the incredible acceleration for which Class 74 was known.|$|E
40|$|Timber {{transport}} in {{the forest}} {{is a very complex}} operation, and expensive from an energy point of view. Furthermore, in some cases, this operation can be very difficult and dangerous in unfavorable conditions of the road surface, which mainly occur in winter (frozen ground) and in spring (muddy ground). The goal {{of this study was to}} develop an innovative transmission hydraulic control system for trailer <b>motor</b> <b>axle</b> that would allow correlating the forward speed of the trailer with that of the tractor, which is not necessarily always the same. In detail, the innovative <b>motor</b> <b>axle</b> of the trailer is driven by a hydraulic motor through a pump controlled electronically. A specific software is able to correlate the forward speed of the trailer with the speed of the tractor in any operating situation, thanks to the information given by a potentiometer screwed behind to the trailer component coupled to the tractor. The innovative system developed to control the trailer <b>motor</b> <b>axle</b> provides the possibility to use the trailer with any type of tractor, not requiring long and complex adjustment of tractor and trailer, since it is completely independent from the type of the tractor used...|$|E
25|$|The trams were {{equipped}} with two Hägglund-built H-bogies. They had an outer frame with the <b>motor</b> <b>axles</b> {{parallel with the}} wheel axles. Each axle had four rubber suspensions as its primary suspension. The carriage rested on the bogie on rubber plates. Later the bogies were supplemented with a shock absorber. The motors were connected to the wheel axles via a universal joint and a gear. The wheels were rubber suspended, but were later replaced with steel-suspended axle boxes which required less maintenance.|$|R
5000|$|Talgo has {{developed}} recently a train known as [...] "AVRIL" [...] (Alta Velocidad Rueda Independiente Ligero — Light High-Speed Independent Wheel), intended for speeds of 380 km/h. The system uses underfloor traction {{in the front}} and rear vehicles, with the intermediate carriages having the Talgo Pendular system (which cannot use <b>motored</b> <b>axles</b> on the axles corresponding to the system). Starting with the concept stage in 2009, it began dynamic testing on the Spanish high-speed network in 2014, and was approved in May 2016. It won its first major contract in November 2016, for the Mediterranean corridor in Spain, and its link to Paris.|$|R
25|$|Each {{train is}} made up of two 4-car units of the {{configuration}} Driving Motor - Trailer - Non Driving Motor - Uncoupling (Shunting) Non Driving Motor, which are coupled back-to-back. The trains are maintained at the Victoria line's Northumberland Park Depot, with Bombardier staff on site for warranty parts replacement. They were originally intended to have all-motored axles as in the 1992 Stock, so that they would have enough traction and acceleration for faster running times; however, it was later decided that 75% of <b>motored</b> <b>axles</b> would be sufficient, which reduced project costs by around £10 million (about 3.5% of the overall cost). They have mechanical-only Scharfenberg couplers.|$|R
50|$|The F {{units were}} popular {{passenger}} locomotives on mountain grades (where they were recommended by EMD), because a four-unit set had more <b>motored</b> <b>axles</b> than {{a trio of}} E-units of equivalent power (sixteen versus twelve) and thus had less chance of overloading the traction motors. Additionally, that 4-unit F set had all its weight on driven wheels and was thereby capable of greater tractive effort. The AT&SF Super Chief, CB&Q/D&RGW/WP California Zephyr, and GN Empire Builder all used F units on their Chicago-West Coast routes in the 1950s. The F7 was also popular for commuter lines and other passenger service where the trains were short.|$|R
50|$|Recent <b>motors</b> {{contain an}} <b>axle</b> hole {{enabling}} axles of different lengths to be used.|$|R
50|$|The Electric {{drive system}} {{consists}} {{of a series of}} lithium-ion batteries and front & rear <b>axle</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{technological}} {{system uses}} an engine or motor {{as the power}} source, and wheels and axles, propellers, or a propulsive nozzle to generate the force. Components such as clutches or gearboxes {{may be needed to}} connect the <b>motor</b> to <b>axles,</b> wheels, or propellors.|$|R
25|$|The Shinkansen {{has used}} the {{electric}} multiple unit configuration from the outset, with the 0 Series Shinkansen having all axles powered. Other railway manufacturers were traditionally reluctant, or unable to use distributed traction configurations (e.g. Talgo used the locomotive configuration with the AVE Class 102 and continues with it for the Talgo AVRIL {{on account of the}} fact that it is not possible to use powered bogies as part of the Talgo Pendular system). In Japan, significant engineering desirability exists for the electric multiple unit configuration. A greater proportion of <b>motored</b> <b>axles</b> results in higher acceleration, meaning that the Shinkansen does not lose as much time if stopping frequently. Shinkansen lines have more stops in proportion to their lengths than high-speed lines elsewhere in the world.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{countries}} in Comecon also received subcontractor orders. East Germany itself supplied inter alia hydrodynamic transmissions and <b>axle</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1993, {{the train}} was {{modified}} {{with the addition of}} <b>motors</b> to all <b>axles,</b> increasing its overall rating to [...]|$|R
50|$|Brakes are non-motorised {{additions}} to a K*bot which {{prevent it from}} being pushed backward. These vary from simple chassis protrusions, designed to snag and dig into the tabletop surface, to more advanced strategies such as slip-gears and backward-mounted friction <b>motors</b> on <b>axles</b> {{to prevent them from}} turning backward.|$|R
5000|$|Co-Co is a {{code for}} a {{locomotive}} wheel arrangement with two six-wheeled bogies with all axles powered, {{with a separate}} <b>motor</b> per <b>axle.</b> Co+Co is the code for a similar wheel arrangement but with an articulated connection between the bogies. The equivalent UIC classification for this arrangement is Co′Co′.|$|R
50|$|A similar arrangement, {{but without}} {{separate}} traction <b>motors</b> for each <b>axle,</b> {{would be a}} B'B'B' arrangement as UIC, indistinguishably B-B-B in AAR.|$|R
50|$|Each axle was powered: the {{traction}} <b>motors</b> were <b>axle</b> hung, nose suspended, {{driving the}} wheelsets via a single reduction gear. The motors were connected in three parallel connected groups of sets of two motors connected in series; each motor {{was a series}} wound machine rated at 220 hp, 300V, 550A.|$|R
50|$|With {{diesel-electric}} {{and electric}} locomotives, the gear ratio between the traction <b>motors</b> and <b>axles</b> is what adapts the unit to freight or passenger service, although a passenger unit may include other features, such as {{head end power}} (also referred to as hotel power or electric train supply) or a steam generator.|$|R
50|$|Advantages of {{individual}} wheel motors include simplified traction control, {{all wheel drive}} if required and a lower floor (useful for buses and other specialised vehicles (some 8x8 all-wheel drive military vehicles use individual wheel motors). Diesel-electric locomotives have used this concept (individual <b>motors</b> driving <b>axles</b> of each pair of wheels) for 70 years.|$|R
50|$|The Baltimore and Ohio {{considered}} {{a fleet of}} powerful 5,000 hp 4-2-2-2-2-4 express locomotives in the late 1930s, powered by four V4 <b>motors,</b> one per <b>axle.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mason Motors was a {{separate}} venture, a Flint-based automobile engine manufacturer started in 1911, also by A.C. Mason, who first led Buick's engine works in Flint. That company was absorbed by Chevrolet in 1915, but remained under the Chevrolet umbrella until January 1, 1918, {{when it became}} known as the <b>Motor</b> and <b>Axle</b> Division of Chevrolet.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Fusée Electrique of 1893, body removed. Compounded pistons drove a Gramme-style dynamo {{powering}} electric <b>motors</b> on all <b>axles.</b> The small engine, right, was the exciter for the dynamo windings.|$|R

2500|$|Ultimately, {{the source}} of the energy {{dissipated}} in the dynamic braking grid is the motion of the locomotive as imparted to the traction motor armatures. [...] Therefore, the traction motors impose drag and the locomotive acts as a brake. [...] As speed decreases, the braking effect decays and usually becomes ineffective below approximately 16km/h (10mph), depending on the gear ratio between the traction <b>motors</b> and <b>axles.</b>|$|R
5000|$|All {{coaches are}} {{equipped}} with a Cummins QSK19 diesel engine of [...] at 1800rpm. These power a generator which supplies current to <b>motors</b> driving two <b>axles</b> per coach, with one axle per bogie powered.|$|R
50|$|Dr12 {{consisted}} of two three-axle bogies each of which had one driving <b>motor</b> per <b>axle,</b> on which rested a very rigid steel body with the hardware and the cabins. The locomotive had one large 182-liter 1,800 hp V16 diesel engine mounted in its centre, which was directly connected to the main and auxiliary generator sets. Cabins had safety zones in both ends which were {{designed to protect the}} driver and equipment in a collision.|$|R
5000|$|All {{coaches are}} {{equipped}} with a Cummins QSK19 diesel engine of [...] at 1800 rpm. This powers a generator, which supplies current to <b>motors</b> driving two <b>axles</b> per coach. Approximately 1350 mi can be travelled between each refuelling.|$|R
50|$|As {{with the}} 3100's the {{traction}} for the locomotives is from six DC traction motors. Each <b>motor</b> is <b>axle</b> mounted. Power for the traction motors {{comes from the}} 25 kV overhead line via the roof mounted pantograph through a step down transformer and through the power control equipment to the traction motors. After the stepping down of the voltage the AC power is converted to DC by a rectifier bridge {{for use by the}} traction motors.|$|R
50|$|In the 19th century, {{as well as}} ironforging, the {{business}} produced axles for horse-drawn vehicles. As motor vehicles became more common, in the early 20th century, the forge specialised in <b>motor</b> vehicle <b>axles</b> and in steel bar. During the First World War, forging was stopped, allowing {{the business}} to concentrate on axle production. During the Second World War, production expanded {{to meet the demand}} for military vehicles, and the site was camouflaged {{to reduce the risk of}} bombing raids.|$|R
50|$|For an {{electric}} locomotive or a diesel-electric locomotive, {{starting tractive effort}} can be calculated from the amount of weight on the driving wheels (which may be less than the total locomotive weight in some cases), combined stall torque of the traction motors, the gear ratio between the traction <b>motors</b> and <b>axles,</b> and driving wheel diameter. For a diesel-hydraulic locomotive, the starting tractive effort {{is affected by the}} stall torque of the torque converter, as well as gearing, wheel diameter and locomotive weight.|$|R
50|$|Under the British and Imperial {{classification}} scheme of locomotive axle arrangements, which {{is related to}} the UIC classification, 1Co+Co1 is a classification code for a locomotive wheel arrangement of two eight-wheeled bogies with an articulated inter-bogie connection, each with three axles powered by a separate traction <b>motor</b> per <b>axle</b> and with the fourth non-powered axle in an integral leading pony truck to reduce the axle load. The similar 1Co-Co1 classification is in the same axle configuration, but without the inter-bogie connection.|$|R
