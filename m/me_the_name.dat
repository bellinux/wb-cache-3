2500|$|A {{native of}} Cluj (Kolozsvár) city in Transylvania, the future writer {{was born to}} ethnic Romanian parents: his father, Aurel Isac, was a lawyer, later noted for {{representing}} the Romanian civil disobedience Memorandum movement, after it was prosecuted by the Hungarian authorities; his mother, Elisabeta-Eliza née Roşescu, was a schoolteacher. As the poet later recalled in a tongue-in-cheek memoir of his childhood: [...] "I was born in Cluj, when the Someş was boiling with blood and my father reaped the flowers of pain [...] I came around when called upon by my mother—and the priest baptized me in Eau de Cologne, or blood, or tears, or holy water—and my godfather wanted to give <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> Alfred, for he loved Musset, but my father gave <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> , since he loved Rousseau." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sartine {{personally}} analyzed {{an enormous}} correspondence and received his subordinates and commissioners of police anytime {{of day and}} night. He {{was the first to}} use repentant thieves and reprieved convicts as informants and agents. To courtiers who found this shocking, he used to say: [...] "Pray tell <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of honest people who would like to do such a job." [...] Sartine was also a man of action, with great presence of mind. On one occasion, having to quell a riot on the Place Maubert, he met the crowd {{at the head of a}} company of musketeers and had an officer respectfully remove his hat and tell the crowd: [...] "Gentlemen, we come here in the name of the King, but our orders are to shoot at the scoundrels only. I therefore pray the honest people to leave the square." [...] The crowd disbanded without a gunshot.|$|E
2500|$|In 1940 Maksakova {{gave birth}} to {{daughter}} Lyudmila. She never revealed the identity of her father, not even to her daughter. Lyudmila Maksakova remembered: [...] "Many years later a [...] Moscow Art Theatre actor whom I met at the Morocco Film festival revealed to <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of my father: Aleksander Volkov, the singer with the Bolshoi. 'Your father {{did not want to}} live in the USSR, he crossed the frontline and soon in the USA opened an opera and drama school,' this man told me. It was only then that I saw the reasons behind my mother's fear – not for herself, but for me, her only daughter." [...] As the war was coming to an end, things for Maria Maksakova started to look brighter. In 1944 she won the 1st Prize at the Russian Folk song competition held by the Arts Committee of the USSR. In 1946 she received her first Stalin Prize [...] "for the outstanding achievements in opera and the performing arts." [...] Two more were to come, in 1949 and 1951.|$|E
60|$|Archie gave <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>names,</b> and, {{except in}} the case of the first recruit, I could find no fault with any.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} was then that he told <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of all <b>the</b> tenants. He used to scold me because I did not {{understand}} the nature of their leases." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{are there}} {{no more of}} them--have you told <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of all <b>the</b> great people you have ever known or heard of?" [...] he said, with a curious smile.|$|R
2500|$|On December 1, 1910, Wedge {{was arrested}} and incarcerated in the city jail on charges of battery for {{attempting}} to strike a night watchman named Gus Miller and begging after being found on Fifth Street near Market Street at 4.30am. Wedge denied the allegations and explained his alcoholic odor as due to his incarceration with drunks and [...] "wine bums", and that he possessed port wine {{given to him by}} the Hahnemann Hospital to prevent pneumonia. Wedge was given the sobriquet [...] "The Fighting Parson of the Barbary Coast". In 1917 Wedge explained its origin: [...] "I was preaching on a beer keg in a saloon on the Barbary coast in San Francisco when a couple of toughs went for me. I guess maybe I cleaned out the place then. A reporter on the San Francisco newspaper gave <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>name.</b> He said I was a fellow who, if he could not preach good into men, would knock h—l out of them. Those fellows got me, though, and put me in the hospital for a while". After being hospitalized after a vicious assault by several denizens of the Barbary Coast at the corner of Pacific and Montgomery avenues, by the end of 1910 Wedge decided to return to Omaha to recuperate and to attempt to reconcile with Prudence Tracy.|$|E
60|$|And {{then her}} shining {{whiteness}} suggested to <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> {{that must be}} hers.|$|E
60|$|The boatman gave <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of this wicked household, but it {{is perhaps}} better forgotten.|$|E
6000|$|... "But say, isn't {{that rather}} rough upon your uncle?" [...] he asked doubtfully. [...] "We can't bother him with every little thing. Surely {{there can be}} nothing indiscreet in your giving <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of your guests. Most people send them to the papers themselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ha, ha, ha!' laughed Mr Slyme again. 'Obliged to two strangers for {{a tavern}} bill! I obliged to two architect's apprentices. Fellows who measure earth with iron chains, and build houses like bricklayers. Give <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> {{of those two}} apprentices. How dare they oblige me!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must give}} <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of all <b>the</b> {{officers}} {{who came to}} the house, Mrs. Rooney. Many of them may be alive still, and their testimony that a child was born would be most important, for at present there is only your word against John O'Carroll's." ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{the first}} time, Agnes spoke sharply. 'Nonsense, Emily! Tell <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> directly--or drop the subject--whichever you like best.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From Granny Willis. She gave <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>name,</b> an' I likes it, an' mean {{to stick}} by it--Good arternoon, gen'lemen. Ta, ta, Punch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will. Can {{you tell}} <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of this flower which I found in your greenhouse. It looks {{much like a}} California blossom." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Can {{you tell}} <b>me</b> <b>the</b> man's <b>name</b> {{children}} look for on Christmas Eve?" ...|$|R
60|$|To-day our voyage is to end. I am so glad. When we came on deck Mr. Peters {{told me that}} we were {{in sight}} of land. He told <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of <b>the</b> places, but they were hard and {{difficult}} to remember, like Long Island and Sandy Hook; not a bit like our dear old simple German names.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, fellows, why won't {{some of you}} {{let me get a}} word in edgeways?" [...] {{came from}} Dan Soppinger, who stood with his back against the door leading to the hall. [...] "I've been wanting to ask you a {{question}} for the last ten minutes. Who of you can tell <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of <b>the</b> fifth, tenth, and fifteenth presidents of our country?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I know," [...] said Dean significantly; [...] "you {{need not}} recall that just now. Can you give <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> and {{address of the}} family in Pimlico?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, heaven, she gifs <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> {{that no one}} speaks since Minna died!" [...] {{cried the}} Professor, pausing in a puddle to regard her with {{grateful}} delight.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will see}} that it reaches him," [...] he said. [...] "And now will you kindly tell <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of the man for whom you {{collected}} that money?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will you do <b>me</b> <b>the</b> favour, Guert Ten Eyck, to let <b>me</b> have <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of <b>the</b> strangers I {{have the}} {{pleasure}} to receive," [...] said the mayor, a little authoritatively.|$|R
5000|$|Richard Kobritz, the {{producer}} of Carpenter's 1978 TV film Someone's Watching <b>Me!</b> inspired <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of <b>the</b> character Mrs. Kobritz.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Tell <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> {{of some of}} {{the masters}} at St Austin's, Mr MacArthur,' said Miss Beezley. She habitually spoke as if she were an {{examination}} paper, and her manner might have seemed to some to verge upon the autocratic, but the Babe was too thankful that the question was not on Browning or the higher algebra to notice this. He reeled off a list of names.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was told}} to me down East, and {{they said it was}} {{absolutely}} true," [...] was the answer. [...] "They even gave <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of the old lady." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, you are wrong. And now, {{never mind}} what I have been: don't trouble your head further about me; but tell <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> {{of the house}} where we are." ...|$|E
6000|$|And another, [...] "Can {{you tell}} <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> {{of a place}} that nobody ever heard of, where nothing ever happened, in a country {{which has not been}} {{discovered}} yet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Flo. Now for <b>me,</b> in <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of impudence!--[Comes forward.] They are the {{greatest}} beauties, I confess, that ever I beheld-- ...|$|R
6000|$|DEAR SIR:--You used {{to express}} {{a good deal of}} {{partiality}} for me, and if you are still so, now is the time. Some friends here are really for <b>me</b> for <b>the</b> U.S. Senate, and I should be very grateful if you could make a mark for me among your members. Please write me at all events, giving <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>names,</b> post-offices, and [...] "political position" [...] of members round about you. Direct to Springfield.|$|R
50|$|When It's Just You and <b>Me</b> is <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of a Country music album by Country singer, Dottie West, {{released}} in 1977.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you? Then {{perhaps you}} can tell <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of your County Superintendent. I'm looking for a school." [...] He smiled frankly. [...] "I'm just out of Jackson University, and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon," [...] he answered. [...] "I was thoughtless. That, of course, is not possible. Tell <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> and {{the address of}} the person to whom you went." ...|$|E
60|$|Having told <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of Mr. Candy's assistant, Betteredge {{appeared}} {{to think that}} we had wasted enough of our time on an insignificant subject. He resumed the perusal of Rosanna Spearman's letter.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Cavalletto! Wake, boy! Rub {{your eyes}} and look at <b>me.</b> Not <b>the</b> <b>name</b> you used to call me--don't use that--Lagnier, say Lagnier!' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{terraces}} of {{the garden}} are held up to the sun, the sun falls full upon them, they are like a vessel slanted up, to catch the superb, heavy light. Within the walls we are remote, perfect, moving in heavy spring sunshine, under the bony avenue of vines. The padrone makes little exclamatory noises that mean nothing, and teaches <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of vegetables. <b>The</b> land is rich and black.|$|R
6000|$|If {{she married}} <b>me</b> under <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of Lady Errand, and if Mrs. Thompson's letter was false, then would the wedding be all square? ...|$|R
