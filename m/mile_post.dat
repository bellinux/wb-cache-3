5|$|Cambridge won {{the coin}} toss and chose {{to start from}} the {{southern}} side, the Surrey side, of the River Thames, based on the opinion that taking a lead early in the race would give them an advantage. However, the theory failed as Oxford stayed with Cambridge, and though Cambridge had a large push which gave them a slender lead after two minutes, Oxford were leading at the First <b>Mile</b> <b>post,</b> passing in 3 minutes 41 seconds, Cambridge a second behind.|$|E

With a higher stroke rate than their opponents, the Light Blues took the lead from the start and by Craven Steps were almost clear. At the <b>Mile</b> <b>Post,</b> Oxford had cut the lead to half a length, but were forced to take evasive action to avoid a collision with river traffic.|$|E

25|$|The {{defenses}} on {{the road}} to Trolak started with a four-mile corridor at the 60 <b>mile</b> <b>post</b> extending through almost impenetrable jungle to the 64 <b>mile</b> <b>post,</b> after the village the road cuts through the more open terrain of the Cluny Rubber estate for five miles before reaching the Slim River rail bridge. The road then bends east and follows the river upstream for another six miles before it crosses the Slim River at a road bridge. The British commander, Acting Major-General Paris (normally commander of the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade), had lost one of his three brigades after the fighting at Kampar; the amalgamated 5/16 Brigade, after retreating through the 12th Brigade, had been moved to a coastal defense position further south to defend the western flank of the division and to rest and reorganise. This left Paris with Lt.Col.Ian Stewart's 12th Indian Brigade and Lt.Col.Ray Selby's 28th Gurkha Brigade, both at reduced strengths due to heavy casualties in the earlier battles at Kampar and on the Grik Road, to defend the northern bank of the river.|$|E
500|$|CUWBC took on Molesey Boat Club on 22 February in a {{race from}} the Chiswick Steps to the Start post. [...] A good start from the Light Blues saw them almost a length ahead by Chiswick Eyot, and move into a clear water {{advantage}} by St Paul's School. [...] A further length's advantage was taken by Hammersmith Bridge which was soon extended to two by Harrods and three by the <b>Mile</b> <b>Post.</b> [...] Despite encountering a strong headwind, CUWBC continued {{to pull away from}} Molesey and passed the Start line six lengths clear. Six days later, OUWBC competed against Molesey in a three-piece set on the Championship Course. [...] Aggressive steering from the Dark Blues earned them several warnings from the umpire during the first race, and although it was initially close, OUWBC pulled away to hold a length's lead by the <b>Mile</b> <b>Post</b> before passing under Hammersmith Bridge two lengths ahead. [...] The second segment from the <b>Mile</b> <b>Post</b> to Chiswick Eyot featured further clashes between the crews, but Oxford dominated, leading by three lengths at St Paul's boathouses and winning by four lengths. [...] In the third race, Molesey took an early lead but OUWBC recovered before the crews shot Barnes Bridge, finishing the piece two lengths ahead.|$|E
500|$|Cambridge {{started as}} pre-race favourites. [...] They won the toss and elected {{to start from}} the Surrey station.

[...] Under pressure from the Dark Blues, Whyman steered his crew to record times between the <b>Mile</b> <b>Post</b> and Barnes Bridge, Hammersmith Bridge to Barnes Bridge, Chiswick Steps to Barnes Bridge and Chiswick Steps to the finishing post. [...] Cambridge won by two-and-three-quarter lengths {{in a time of}} 16 minutes 58 seconds, the second-fastest time on record (thirteen seconds slower than the winning time in the 1984 race).|$|E

500|$|OUWBC faced a {{crew from}} Oxford Brookes University Boat Club (OBUBC) in two races along the Championship Course on 19 February.

[...] A length ahead at the <b>Mile</b> <b>Post,</b> the Dark Blues were {{comfortable}} winners. [...] The second race, from Hammersmith to Barnes Bridge followed a similar pattern with OBUBC taking an early lead, and OUWBC pushing through for the win. [...] On 19 March, the Dark Blues took on a crew from Molesey in two races on the Tideway. [...] A tight start during which Winckless, the umpire, warned both crews, Molesey took a marginal lead. [...] OUWBC were back on level terms by the <b>Mile</b> <b>Post</b> and in calmer conditions, pushed away from Molesey to be a length up by Harrods. [...] Pulling further ahead, the Dark Blues won by three lengths. [...] The second race saw Molesey take the lead once again, and were soon a length up.
