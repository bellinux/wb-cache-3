50|$|Evidence {{exists in}} support of a highly {{cross-linked}} heteropolymer bound covalently to matrix scaffolding melanoproteins. It has been proposed that the ability of melanin to act as an antioxidant is directly proportional to its degree of polymerization or molecular weight. Suboptimal conditions for the effective polymerization of melanin monomers may lead to formation of lower-molecular-weight, pro-oxidant melanin that has been implicated in the causation and progression of macular degeneration and melanoma. Signaling pathways that upregulate <b>melanization</b> in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) also may be implicated in the downregulation of rod outer segment phagocytosis by the RPE. This phenomenon has been attributed in part to foveal sparing in macular degeneration.|$|E
50|$|However, <b>melanization</b> {{may come}} at some {{metabolic}} {{cost to the}} fungal cells: {{in the absence of}} radiation, some non-melanized fungi (that had been mutated in the melanin pathway) grew faster than their melanized counterparts. Limited uptake of nutrients due to the melanin molecules in the fungal cell wall or toxic intermediates formed in melanin biosynthesis have been suggested to contribute to this phenomenon. It is consistent with the observation that despite being capable of producing melanin, many fungi do not synthesize melanin constitutively (i.e., all the time), but often only in response to external stimuli or at different stages of their development. The exact biochemical processes in the suggested melanin-based synthesis of organic compounds or other metabolites for fungal growth, including the chemical intermediates (such as native electron donor and acceptor molecules) in the fungal cell and the location and chemical products of this process, are unknown.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} basic types of hemocytes found in fruit flies: secretory, plasmatocytes, crystal cells, and lamellocytes. Secretory cells are never {{released}} into the hemolymph and instead send out signalling molecules responsible for cell differentiation. Plasmatocytes are the hemocytes responsible for cell ingestion (phagocytosis) and represent about 95% of circulating hemocytes. Crystal cells are only found in the larval stage of Drosophila, and {{they are involved in}} <b>melanization,</b> a process by which microbes/pathogens are engulfed in a hardened gel and destroyed via anti-microbial peptides and other proteins involved in the humoral response. They constitute about 5% of circulating hemocytes. Lamellocytes are flat cells that are never found in adult cells, and instead are only present in larval cells for their ability to encapsulate invading pathogens. They specifically act on parasitic wasp eggs that bind to the surfaces of cells, and are incapable of being phagocytosed by host cells.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the light}} of climate change there is growing {{interest}} in understanding carbon sequestration in mycorrhizal fungal tissues. There is considerable evidence suggesting that C. geophilum mycelium, ectomycorrhizas and sclerotia are highly resistant to decay and have potential to sequester {{a great deal of}} carbon in their tissues. Fernandez et al. (2013) found that C. geophilum ectomycorrhizas persisted considerably longer in the soil than those of other ectomycorrhizal fungi. [...] This resistance to decay is likely related to the heavy <b>melanization</b> of the cell wall found in C. geophilum hyphae which cannot be degraded with hydrolyzing enzymes and requires the implementation of oxadative enzymes, much like lignin in plant litters. [...] Cenococcum geophilum produces resting structures called sclerotia. These structures have been found to remain viable in the soil for years. Remarkably, these structures are known to persist relatively undecomposed in the soil for thousands of years.|$|E
50|$|A pyralid moth species, Plodia interpunctella, {{commonly}} found in food storage areas, exhibits maternal dietary effects, as well as paternal dietary effects, on its offspring. Epigenetic changes in moth offspring affect the production of phenoloxidase, an enzyme involved with <b>melanization</b> and correlated with resistance of certain pathogens in many invertebrate species. In this study, parent moths were housed in food rich or food poor environments during their reproductive period. Moths who were housed in food poor environments produced offspring with less phenoloxidase, and thus had a weaker immune system, than moths who reproduced in food rich environments. This {{is believed to be}} adaptive because the offspring develop while receiving cues of scarce nutritional opportunities. These cues allow the moth to allocate energy differentially, decreasing energy allocated for the immune system and devoting more energy towards growth and reproduction to increase fitness and insure future generations. One explanation for this effect may be imprinting, the expression of only one parental gene over the other, but further research has yet to be done.|$|E
50|$|Melanins {{have very}} diverse roles and {{functions}} in various organisms. A form of melanin {{makes up the}} ink used by many cephalopods (see cephalopod ink) as a defense mechanism against predators. Melanins also protect microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, against stresses that involve cell damage such as UV radiation {{from the sun and}} reactive oxygen species. Melanin also protects against damage from high temperatures, chemical stresses (such as heavy metals and oxidizing agents), and biochemical threats (such as host defenses against invading microbes). Therefore, in many pathogenic microbes (for example, in Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungus) melanins appear to play important roles in virulence and pathogenicity by protecting the microbe against immune responses of its host. In invertebrates, a major aspect of the innate immune defense system against invading pathogens involves melanin. Within minutes after infection, the microbe is encapsulated within melanin (<b>melanization),</b> and the generation of free radical byproducts during the formation of this capsule is thought to aid in killing them. Some types of fungi, called radiotrophic fungi, appear {{to be able to use}} melanin as a photosynthetic pigment that enables them to capture gamma rays and harness this energy for growth.|$|E
40|$|SummarySerine {{protease}} cascades {{are involved}} in blood coagulation and immunity. In arthropods, they regulate <b>melanization,</b> which {{plays an important role}} in immune defense and wound healing. However, the mechanisms underlying <b>melanization</b> pathways are not completely characterized. We found that in the mosquito Aedes aegypti, there are two distinct <b>melanization</b> activation pathways carried out by different modules of serine proteases and their specific inhibitors serpins. Immune <b>melanization</b> proteases (IMP- 1 and IMP- 2) and Serpin- 1 mediate hemolymph prophenoloxidase cleavage and immune response against the malaria parasite. Tissue <b>melanization,</b> exemplified by the formation of melanotic tumors, is controlled by tissue <b>melanization</b> protease (CLIPB 8), IMP- 1, and Serpin- 2. In addition, serine proteases CLIPB 5 and CLIPB 29 {{are involved in}} activation of Toll pathway by fungal infection or by infection-independent manner, respectively. Serpin- 2 is implicated in the latter activation of Toll pathway. This study revealed the complexity underlying <b>melanization</b> and Toll pathway in mosquitoes...|$|E
40|$|A {{prominent}} response {{during the}} Drosophila host defence is the induction of proteolytic cascades, {{some of which}} lead to localized <b>melanization</b> of pathogen surfaces, while others activate {{one of the major}} players in the systemic antimicrobial response, the Toll pathway. Despite the fact that gain-of-function mutations in the Toll receptor gene result in <b>melanization,</b> a clear link between Toll activation and the <b>melanization</b> reaction has not been firmly established. Here, we present evidence for the coordination of hemolymph-borne <b>melanization</b> with activation of the Toll pathway in the Drosophila host defence. The <b>melanization</b> reaction requires Toll pathway activation and depends on the removal of the Drosophila serine protease inhibitor Serpin 27 A. Flies deficient for this serpin exhibit spontaneous <b>melanization</b> in larvae and adults. Microbial challenge induces its removal from the hemolymph through Toll-dependent transcription of an acute phase immune reaction component...|$|E
40|$|The <b>melanization</b> {{reaction}} {{is used as}} an immune mechanism in arthropods to encapsulate and kill microbial pathogens. In Drosophila, the serpin Spn 27 A regulates <b>melanization</b> apparently by inhibiting the protease that activates phenoloxidase, the key enzyme in melanin synthesis. Here, we have described the genetic characterization of two immune inducible serine proteases, MP 1 and MP 2, which act in a <b>melanization</b> cascade regulated by Spn 27 A. MP 1 is required to activate <b>melanization</b> in response to both bacterial and fungal infection, whereas MP 2 is mainly involved during fungal infection. Pathogenic bacteria and fungi may therefore trigger two different <b>melanization</b> cascades that use MP 1 as a common downstream protease to activate phenoloxidase. We have also shown that the <b>melanization</b> reaction activated by MP 1 and MP 2 {{plays an important role}} in augmenting the effectiveness of other immune reactions, thereby promoting resistance of Drosophila to microbial infection...|$|E

Melanin formation was optimal in the later stages of growth, and there was no correlation between nitrogenase activity and <b>melanization.</b> Nitrogenase activity in strain 184 was optimal at 10 % O 2, and melanin formation was suppressed by O 2 limitation. In the presence of charcoal, an adsorbent of toxic oxygen intermediates, and benzoic acid, a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals, <b>melanization</b> was inhibited.

40|$|Cryptococcus neoformans melanizes in the {{environment}} and in mammalian tissues, but the process of <b>melanization</b> in either venue is mysterious given that this microbe produces melanin only from exogenous substrates.

30|$|Eumelanin is a heteropolymer that is {{generally}} composed of hydroxylated indole residues and plays diverse protective functions in various species.

40|$|Abstract Despite the {{functional}} significance of melanin-based plumage coloration {{in social and}} sexual signaling, the mechanisms controlling its information content are poorly understood. The T-regulation hypothesis proposes that melanin ornaments signal competitive abilities via the effects of testosterone (T) mediating both <b>melanization</b> and sexual/aggressive behaviors. Using the phylogenetic comparative approach, we tested whether frontal black <b>melanization</b> is associated with elevated T {{around the time of}} breeding plumage development across all bird species with available T-data. We found a context-dependent relationship between <b>melanization</b> and T, varying with the type of ornamentation (patchy or full-black) and with the presumed taxonomic distribution of the hormonal control of plumage dichromatism. Within two taxa in which male plumage development is assumed androgen-dependent (Charadriiformes, Corvida), evolutionary increases in male <b>melanization,</b> and melanin dichromatism correlated with increases in T in most analyses but not within the basal lineage (ratites, Galloanseriformes) with androgen-indepen-dent male plumage. Among Passeroidea with presumably genetically or luteinizing-hormone-based male plumage, <b>melanization</b> and its dichromatism correlated with T only in species with < 100 % frontal <b>melanization.</b> These results were robust as we controlled for several confounding variables such as mating and parental behaviors. This study is the first to test and support the T-regulation hypothesis interspecifically, suggesting that among-species differences in <b>melanization</b> may have evolved in response to differ-ences in circulating T in certain avian taxa. Our results imply that the extent of black ornamentation may serve as an honest indicator of male competitiveness in those species that evolved an appropriate hormonal basis (T dependence) for color production...|$|E
40|$|Plovers {{and their}} allies exhibit an {{impressive}} diversity of melanin-based plumage patterns ranging from non-melanized to completely melanized species. We use phylogenetic comparative methods to test whether <b>melanization</b> has evolved in relation to sexual selection for attracting mates, to selection for signalling territory defence, or to natural selection for camouflage. First, according to sexual-selection theory, melanized plumage has evolved to amplify the courtship displays of males. As predicted by this hypothesis, we found that males with aerial displays had more melanized plumage than males of ground-displaying species. In addition, sexual dimorphism in <b>melanization</b> was greater in species with display flights than in species with ground displays. Second, <b>melanization</b> may have evolved through social interactions to signal competitive ability in territory defence. We did not find evidence for this hypothesis, since breeding density was unrelated to the <b>melanization</b> of either sex. Finally, melanized plumage may camouflage the incubating parent. The latter hypothesis was not supported, since <b>melanization</b> was unrelated either to the darkness of nest substrate or the extent of vegetation cover. Taken together, our results are most consistent with the sexual-selection hypothesis, and suggest that melanized plumage has evolved to enhance the aerial displays of male plovers...|$|E
40|$|Cryptococcus neoformans is an {{opportunistic}} fungal pathogen {{that has}} several well-described virulence determinants. A polysaccharide capsule {{and the ability}} to produce melanin are among the most important. <b>Melanization</b> occurs both in vitro, in the presence of catecholamine and indole compounds, and in vivo during the infection. Despite the importance of melanin production for cryptococcal virulence, the components and mechanisms involved its synthesis have not been fully elucidated. In this work, we describe the role of a G 1 /S cyclin (Cln 1) in the <b>melanization</b> process. Cln 1 has evolved specifically with proteins present only in other basidiomycetes. We found that Cln 1 is required for the cell wall stability and production of melanin in C. neoformans. Absence of <b>melanization</b> correlated with a defect in the expression of the LAC 1 gene. The relation between cell cycle elements and <b>melanization</b> was confirmed by the effect of drugs that cause cell cycle arrest at different phases, such as rapamycin and benomyl.

In this paper, we identified and characterized RUNX family especially Lz in silkworm, which is a lepidopteran model insect. The gene expression analysis illustrated that BmLz was highly expressed in hemocytes throughout the whole development period, and reached a peak in glutonous stage. Over-expression of BmLz in silkworm accelerated the <b>melanization</b> process of hemolymph, and led to instantaneously up-regulation of prophenoloxidases (PPOs), which were key enzymes in the <b>melanization</b> process. Further down-regulation of BmLz expression by RNA interference resulted in the significant delay of <b>melanization</b> reaction of hemolymph.

40|$|Phagocytosis, <b>melanization</b> and {{nodulation}} in insects {{depend on}} phenoloxidase (PO) activity. In this report, we demonstrated that these three processes {{appear to be}} also dependent on dopa decarboxylase (Ddc) activity. Using flow cytometry, RNA interference, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence, we demonstrated the constitutive expression of Ddc and its strong association with the haemocyte surface, in the medfly Ceratitis capitata. In addition, we showed that Escherichia coli phagocytosis is markedly blocked by small interfering RNA (siRNA) for Ddc, antibodies against Ddc, {{as well as by}} inhibitors of Ddc activity, namely carbidopa and benzerazide, convincingly revealing the involvement of Ddc activity in phagocytosis. By contrast, latex beads and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) did not require Ddc activity for their uptake. It was also shown that nodulation and <b>melanization</b> processes depend on Ddc activation, because antibodies against Ddc and inhibitors of Ddc activity prevent haemocyte aggregation and <b>melanization</b> in the presence of excess E. coli. Therefore, phagocytosis, <b>melanization</b> and nodulation depend on haemocyte-surface-associated PO and Ddc. These three unrelated mechanisms are based on tyrosine metabolism and share a number of substrates and enzymes; however, they appear to be distinct. Phagocytosis and nodulation depend on dopamine-derived metabolite(s), not including the eumelanin pathway, whereas <b>melanization</b> depends exclusively on the eumelanin pathway. It must also be underlined that <b>melanization</b> is not a prerequisite for phagocytosis or nodulation.

Our quantitative proteomics and biochemical experiments revealed that baculovirus infection of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, reduced levels of most cascade members in the host hemolymph and PO activity. By contrast, serpin- 9 and serpin- 5 were sequentially upregulated after the viral infection. The H. armigera serpin- 5 and serpin- 9 regulate <b>melanization</b> by directly inhibiting their target proteases cSP 4 and cSP 6, respectively and cSP 6 activates PPO purified from hemolymph. Furthermore, serpin- 5 / 9 -depleted insects exhibited high PO activities and showed resistance to baculovirus infection.

40|$|Multiple {{forms of}} tyrosinase, T 1, T 2, T 3, {{have been shown}} to differ with respect to {{carbohydrate}} moieties of these isozymes. We demonstrated that, in cultured B- 16 melanoma cells, <b>melanization</b> can be completely interrupted by glycosylation inhibitors, such as glucosamine and tunicamycin, and that these inhibitors cause a selective loss of membrane-bound T 3. It is further found that inhibition of <b>melanization</b> induced by glucosamine occurs even in the presence of protease inhibitors, such as phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and leupeptin, and that <b>melanization</b> inhibition is reversible upon removal of the inhibitor. In this report we have also examined the process of development and recovery of the tyrosinase isozymes in cells in which the interruption of melanogenesis has been released by the removal of these glycosylation inhibitors. The recovery process, which occurs during the period after interrupted melanogenesis and is a process of remelanization, has been biochemically followed. Tyrosinases obtained from the deoxycholate-solubilized large-granule fraction of these melanoma cells have been analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immediately after removal (0 h recovery) of the glycosylation inhibitor, loss of <b>melanization</b> and T 3 is accompanied by T 1 heterogeneity which is visualized as two electrophoretically distinct species, T 1 ' and T 1 ″.

40|$|Abstract: Evolutionary studies {{typically}} {{focus on}} adaptations to particular environmental conditions, thereby often ignoring {{the role of}} possible constraints. Here {{we focus on the}} case of variation in dorsal wing <b>melanization</b> in a satyrine butterfly Pararge aegeria. Because melanin is a complex polymer, its synthesis may be constrained if ambient conditions limit the resource budget. This hypothesis was tested by comparing <b>melanization</b> among butterflies that fed as larvae on host grasses experiencing different drought-stress treatments. Treatment differences were validated both {{at the level of the}} host plant (nitrogen, carbonate, and water content) and of the butterfly (life-history traits: survival, development time, and size at maturity). <b>Melanization</b> rate was measured as average gray value of the basal dorsal wing area. This area, close to the thorax, is known to be functionally significant for basking in order to thermoregulate. Individuals reared on drought-stressed host plants developed paler wings, and development of darker individuals was slower and less stable as estimated by their level of fluctuating asymmetry. These results provide evidence that melanin is indeed costly to synthesize, and that differences in environmental quality can induce phenotypic variation in wing <b>melanization.</b> Therefore, studies dealing with spatial and/or temporal patterns of variation in wing <b>melanization</b> should not focus on adaptive explanations alone, but rather on a cost-benefit balance under particular sets of environmental conditions...|$|E
