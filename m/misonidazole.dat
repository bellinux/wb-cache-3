The distribution of <b>misonidazole</b> in liver, kidney, heart, spleen and tumour tissue, 24 h later, was studied by scintillation counting and by autoradiography.

40|$|Because the {{nitrosourea}} CCNU {{is given}} exclusively by the oral route in man, we have carried out studies in mice on the antitumour activity, acute toxicity and pharmacokinetics of oral CCNU, either {{alone or in}} combination with the chemosensitizer <b>misonidazole.</b> In both plasma and KHT tumour the peak concentration and "early" AUC for total nitrosoureas were about 1. 4 - 1. 5 fold greater for the oral compared to the i. p. route. These differences were reflected in the roughly twofold greater antitumour activity for the oral route. In contrast, acute toxicity tests showed that oral CCNU was 1. 45 times less toxic to normal tissue, although the dose-limiting organ may be different for the two routes. <b>Misonidazole</b> reduced the antitumour activity of oral CCNU by dose modifying factors (DMF) of 0. 58 - 0. 71.

40|$|Summary. -The hypoxic cell {{sensitizer}} <b>Misonidazole</b> (Ro- 07 - 0582) induces oncogenic {{transformations in}} the C 3 H/ 1 OTI mouse embryo cell line cultured in vitro.

A higher drug concentration of 6 0 mM is equivalent to 4 Gy. The combination of <b>Misonidazole</b> and X-rays produces {{a significant increase in}} the frequency of transformation over either drug or radiation alone, but the data are equivocal on the question of additivity vs synergism.

The primary tumor was located in {{the head of the}} pancreas in 20 patients, in the head and body in six patients, and in the body and tail in three. Adjuvant chemotherapy was given in 23 of the 29 patients. The last 13 patients have received <b>misonidazole</b> (3. 5 mg/M 2) just prior to IORT (20 Gy). At present 14 patients are alive and 11 are without evidence of disease from 3 to 41 months after IORT. The median survival is 16. 5 months.

40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: Development of new (18) F-labeled tracers for {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} (PET) imaging is increasingly important. Herein, we described the synthesis of silicon analogues of [(18) F]fluoromisonidazole {{in order to develop}} new radiolabelled compounds for the detection of tumour hypoxic domain. Their stabilities and their in vivo biodistribution were evaluated. METHODS: (18) F-labeled silicon-based <b>misonidazole</b> analogues were synthesized by alkylating 2 -nitroimidazole with alkyloxy-(3 -chloropropyl) dialkyl or diarylsilane. These intermediates were labeled with [(18) F]F(-) with a mixture of K(18) F and Kryptofix (K 222) in acetonitrile as standard condition. PET imaging was performed using a dedicated small animal PET scanner. RESULTS: (18) F-labeled silicon-based <b>misonidazole</b> analogues were easily synthesized in three steps. The hydrolytic and radiolytic stability of these new fluorosilanes depend on the steric hindrance at the silicon center. Indeed, partial uptake of dimethylfluorosilane [(18) F] 2 a(1 -(3 -(Fluorodimethylsilyl) propyl) - 2 -nitro- 1 H-imidazole) in tumor hypoxic area was observed but defluorination also appeared. Moreover, PET studies indicated that, owing to its high lipophilicity, the most stable dinaphtylfluorosilane [(18) F] 2 d is retained mainly by the lungs. CONCLUSION: We have described an efficient and versatile approach for the synthesis of (18) F-labeled, silicon-based <b>misonidazole</b> analogues.
