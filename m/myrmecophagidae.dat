5|$|Female {{marsupials}} have paired uteri and cervices. Most eutherian (placental) mammal {{species have}} a single cervix and single, bipartite or bicornuate uterus. Lagomorphs, rodents, aardvarks and hyraxes have a duplex uterus and two cervices. Lagomorphs and rodents share many morphological characteristics and are grouped together in the clade Glires. Anteaters of the family <b>myrmecophagidae</b> are unusual in that they lack a defined cervix; they {{are thought to have}} lost the characteristic rather than other mammals developing a cervix on more than one lineage.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} tamandua (Tamandua mexicana) is {{a species of}} tamandua, an anteater in the family <b>Myrmecophagidae.</b> They live in tropical and subtropical forests from southern Mexico, through Central America, and {{to the edge of}} the northern Andes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Myrmecophagidae</b> are {{a family}} of anteaters, the name being derived from the Ancient Greek words for 'ant' and 'eat' (myrmeco- and phagos). Two genera and three species are in the family, {{consisting}} of the giant anteater, and the tamanduas. The fossil Eurotamandua from the Messel Pit in Germany may be an early anteater, but its status is currently debated.|$|E
50|$|Myrmecophagids {{belong to}} the order Xenarthra, {{formerly}} known as Edentata. Xenarthra also includes sloths and armadillos. Edentates (meaning without teeth) diverged from insectivores during the Cretaceous period, roughly 135 million years ago. The fossil record of the family <b>myrmecophagidae</b> dates to the early miocene period in South America, roughly 25 million years ago. Throughout their evolutionary history, myrmecophagids have maintained a narrow range, though at one point their range may have extended to northern Mexico.|$|E

5000|$|The giant {{anteater}} got its binomial name from Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Its generic name, Myrmecophaga, and specific name, tridactyla, are both Greek, meaning [...] "anteater" [...] and [...] "three fingers", respectively. Myrmecophaga jubata {{was used as}} a synonym. Three subspecies have been tentatively proposed: M. t. tridactyla (ranging from Venezuela and the Guianas to northern Argentina), M. t. centralis (native to Central America, northwestern Colombia, and northern Ecuador), and M. t. artata (native to northeastern Colombia and northwestern Venezuela). The {{giant anteater}} is grouped with the semiarboreal northern and southern tamanduas in the family <b>Myrmecophagidae.</b> Together with the family Cyclopedidae, whose only extant member is the arboreal silky anteater, the two families comprise the suborder Vermilingua.Anteaters and sloths belong to order Pilosa and share superorder Xenarthra with the Cingulata (whose only extant members are armadillos). The two orders of Xenarthra split 66 million years ago (Mya) during the Late Cretaceous epoch. Anteaters and sloths diverged around 55 Mya, between the Paleocene and Eocene epochs. The Cyclopes lineage emerged around 30 Mya in the Oligocene epoch, while the Myrmecophaga and Tamandua lineages split 10 Mya in the Late Miocene subepoch. During most of the Cenozoic era, anteaters were confined to South America, which was formerly an island continent. Following the formation of the Isthmus of Panama about 3 Mya, anteaters of all three extant genera invaded Central America as part of the Great American Interchange.|$|E
40|$|The {{mammalian}} fauna of Nicaragua includes seven {{species in}} the order Xenarthra, including the brown-throated three-toed sloth (Bradypus variegatus) in the family Bradypodidae, Hoffmann 2 ̆ 7 s two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni) in the family Megalonychidae, the northern naked-tailed armadillo (Cabassous centralis) and nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) in the family Dasypodidae, and the silky anteater (Cyclopes didactylus) and northern tamandua (Tamandua mexicana) in the family <b>Myrmecophagidae.</b> Additionally, the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) in the family <b>Myrmecophagidae</b> is (or was) certainly part of the fauna of Nicaragua but {{has yet to be}} documented there. Based on 133 xenarthran specimens available in museums and our observations, we herein review and provide new information on distributions, systematics, morphometrics, and natural history of these species in Nicaragua. Replacement of the milk dentition in Dasypus novemcinctus is described and illustrated, documenting the most common adult dental formula of i 0 / 0, c 0 / 0, p 7 / 7, m 1 / 1 = 32...|$|E
40|$|Anteaters {{belong to}} the Order Xenarthra / Family <b>Myrmecophagidae</b> and are the only members without teeth. There are three genera with four living species in the family Myrmecophagidae: Myrmecophaga tridactyla (giant anteater), Tamandua tetradactyla (southern lesser anteater), Tamandua mexicana (northern lesser anteater), and Cyclopes didactylus (silky anteater). The karyotypes of M. tridactyla (2 n = 60), T. tetradactyla (2 n = 54) and C. didactylus (2 n = 64) have already been described. In the present paper, three female and two male {{specimens}} of giant anteater and one lesser anteater male were analyzed. The results indicate {{the existence of a}} new karyotype in the genus Tamandua, with 2 n = 56 chromosomes, which can represent a new lesser anteater species. The karyotype of M. tridactyla was also described, supporting previous reports...|$|E
40|$|The giant {{anteater}} (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), a mammal {{belonging to the}} order Xenarthra and family <b>Myrmecophagidae,</b> is an endangered species. For this reason, additional knowledge about its anatomy is of interest, especially the forelimb, which plays important roles in feeding and defense. The goal {{of this study was}} to learn more about the origin and distribution of the axillary nerve of Myrmecophaga tridactyla by studying two individuals (one male and one female) that belong to the Research Laboratory of Wild Animals (UFU). The study material consisted of corpses fixed and preserved in 10 % aqueous formalin solution. Dissection of the material followed standard procedures. In both animals, the axillary nerve was found in the ventral branch of the sixth cervical (C 6) and seventh (C 7) spinal nerve. This nerve showed symmetry in relation to its position in the two specimens and branched into the teres major, teres minor and deltoid muscles. In both specimens the axillary nerve originated in the cranial cutaneous branch of the lower leg...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide a {{checklist}} of flying and non-flying mammal species which occur in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, delimiting species by vegetation domains and vulnerability. Records were based on specimens in museums, literature, and only eventually on photos (by camera traps). There are 151 mammal species reported or collected in the state, comprising 10 orders and 29 families. The richest orders were Chiroptera (61 spp.), Rodentia (35), Carnivora (18), and Didelphimorphia (16). The richest families were Phyllostomidae (33 species), Cricetidae (23), Didelphidae (16), Molossidae (13), Vespertilionidae (9), Felidae (7), and Dasypodidae (6). Cerrado was the richest domain (117 spp.) followed by Pantanal (110). According to the Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis (IBAMA) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), 17 species are threatened; they are species of Felidae (n = 6), but also include Canidae (2), Didelphidae (2), Cervidae (1), Dasypodidae (1), Dasyproctidae (1), Mustelidae (1), <b>Myrmecophagidae</b> (1), Phyllostomidae (1), and Tapiridae (1) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{parasitism}} of the {{two giant}} anteaters adults (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), one male and one female, infected naturally with Eimeria escomeli, E. tamanduae e E. marajoensis was related in the present research. In E. escomeli oocysts were 23. 9 +/- 1. 89 by 19. 7 +/- 1. 60 microm and its sporocysts were 11. 47 +/- 1. 25 by 6. 48 +/- 0. 80 microm. In E. tamanduae oocysts were 23. 52 +/- 0. 95 by 20. 59 +/- 0. 92 microm and its sporocysts were 12. 19 +/- 0. 65 by 7. 15 +/- 0. 55 microm. In E. marajoensis oocysts were 13. 5 +/- 1. 7 by 13. 1 +/- 1. 8 microm and its sporocysts were 7. 4 +/- 0. 58 by 5. 4 +/- 0. 8 microm. Eimeria escomeli was described before parasitizing giants anteater from Bolivia, and it was point out as {{the first time in}} Brazil. The presence of E. tamanduae and E. marajoensis parasitizing giant anteaters indicate the possibility of having co-infection of them among animals of the family <b>Myrmecophagidae...</b>|$|E
40|$|We sequenced {{part of the}} 16 S rRNA {{mitochondrial}} gene in 17 extant taxa of Pilosa (sloths and anteaters) and used these sequences along with GenBank sequences of both extant and extinct sloths to perform phylogenetic analysis based on parsimony, maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods. By increasing the taxa density for anteaters and sloths {{we were able to}} clarify some points of the Pilosa phylogenetic tree. Our mitochondrial 16 S results show Bradypodidae as a monophyletic and robustly supported clade in all the analysis. However, the Pleistocene fossil Mylodon darwinii does not group significantly to either Bradypodidae or Megalonychidae which indicates that trichotomy best represents the relationship between the families Mylodontidae, Bradypodidae and Megalonychidae. Divergence times also allowed us to discuss the taxonomic status of Cyclopes and the three species of three-toed sloths, Bradypus tridactylus, Bradypus variegatus and Bradypus torquatus. In the Bradypodidae the split between Bradypus torquatus and the proto-Bradypus tridactylus / B. variegatus was estimated as about 7. 7 million years ago (MYA), while in the <b>Myrmecophagidae</b> the first offshoot was Cyclopes at about 31. 8 MYA followed by the split between Myrmecophaga and Tamandua at 12. 9 MYA. We estimate the split between sloths and anteaters to have occurred at about 37 MYA...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Cyclopes didactylus, {{commonly}} called silky anteater, {{is the smallest}} and least studied of the anteaters. It is an arboreal species occurring in rainforests, ranging from southern Mexico to Central and South America, with an apparently disjoint distribution between Amazon and Atlantic rainforests in Brazil. Although seven subspecies are recognized, {{little is known about}} its geographical variation. Thus, to evaluate the population dynamics and evolutionary history of the South American silky anteater, we analyzed 1542 bp sequences of the mitochondrial control region (CR), COI and Cyt-b genes of 32 individuals. Haplotype network, AMOVA and molecular dating analyses were performed and identified seven geographic clusters. The split of lineages separating Cyclopedidae (Cyclopes) and <b>Myrmecophagidae</b> (Myrmecophaga and Tamandua genera) was estimated around 41 million years ago (mya), and the intraspecific lineage diversification of C. didactylus began in the Miocene around 13. 5 mya, likely in southwestern Amazonia. Tectonic and climatic events that took place in South America during the Tertiary and Quaternary seem to have influenced the evolutionary history of the species at different levels. This is the first study to investigate the population dynamics and phylogeography of the silky anteater, which contributes to a better comprehension of the biogeography of South America...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We updated the {{checklist}} of mammals from Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil based on primary records only. One hundred and sixty-six mammal species were listed as {{occurring in the}} state, 47 of them being medium to large, 47 small mammal and 73 bat species. The listed species are distributed in 31 families: Didelphidae (17 spp.), Dasypodidae (7 spp.), <b>Myrmecophagidae</b> (2 spp.), Cebidae (1 sp.), Callithrichidae (2 spp.), Aotidae (1 sp.), Pitheciidae (1 sp.), Atelidae (1 sp.), Leporidae (1 sp.), Felidae (7 spp.), Canidae (4 spp.), Mustelidae (5 spp.), Mephitidae (2 spp.), Procyonidae (2 spp.), Tapiridae (1 sp.), Tayassuidae (2 spp.), Cervidae (4 spp.), Sciuridae (1 sp.), Cricetidae (22 spp.), Erethizontidae (1 sp.), Caviidae (3 spp.), Dasyproctidae (1 sp.), Cuniculidae (1 sp.), Echimyidae (4 spp.), Phyllostomidae (41 spp.), Emballonuridae (2 spp.), Molossidae (16 spp.), Vespertilionidae (9 spp.), Mormoopidae (1 sp.), Noctilionidae (2 spp.), and Natalidade (1 sp.). These numbers represent an increase of fourteen species with primary records for the state {{in comparison with the}} previously published checklist. However, it is evident the scarcity of information at several regions of the state, and the need of implementation of regional zoological collections. The state of Mato Grosso do Sul represent only 4. 19 % of the Brazilian territory, but the number of mammal species reach 24. 13 % of the known species occurring in the country...|$|E
