Hagel stated, [...] "I didn't like what <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rove</b> said, because it frames terrorism {{and the issue of}} terrorism and everything that goes with it, whether it's the renewal of the Patriot Act or the NSA wiretapping, in a political context." ...|$|E

[...] However, while allowing that many Republican members of Congress are [...] "resentful {{of the way he}} and the White House conducted the losing campaign", the New York Times also stated that, [...] "White House officials say President Bush has every intention of keeping <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rove</b> on through the rest of his term." ...|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Rove {{failed to}} tell the grand jury about his conversations with Cooper. According to Rove, he only remembered he had spoken to Cooper after {{discovering}} a July 11, 2003, White House e-mail that Rove had written to then-deputy National Security advisor Stephen J. Hadley in which Rove said he had spoken to Cooper about the Niger controversy. Luskin also testified before the grand jury. He told prosecutors that Time reporter Viveca Novak had told him prior to Rove's first grand jury appearance that she had heard from colleagues at Time that Rove {{was one of the}} sources for Cooper's story about Plame. Luskin in turn said that he told Rove about this, though Rove still did not disclose to the grand jury that he had ever spoken to Cooper about Plame. Viveca Novak testified she couldn't recall when she spoke to Luskin. Rove testified a total of five times before the federal grand jury investigating the leak. After Rove's last appearance, Luskin released a statement that read in part: [...] "In connection with this appearance, the special counsel has advised <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rove</b> that he is not a target of the investigation. Mr. Fitzgerald has affirmed that he has made no decision concerning charges." ...|$|E
5000|$|On June 13, 2006, Robert Luskin {{released}} the following statement:"On June 12, 2006, Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald formally advised {{us that he}} does not anticipate seeking charges against Karl Rove. In deference to the pending case, we will not make any further public statements about {{the subject matter of the}} investigation. We believe that the Special Counsel's decision should put an end to the baseless speculation about <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rove’s</b> conduct." ...|$|R

In apparent compensation he was appointed by Reynders to represent the <b>MR</b> as a <b>roving</b> ambassador abroad. Ducarme died of cancer on 28 August 2010.|$|R
5000|$|On June 14, 2006, Joe Wilson {{responded to}} Luskin's {{statement}} {{by stating that}} [...] "this is a marathon ... it's not over." [...] He referred other questions to a statement released by his lawyer, Christopher Wolf. In the statement, Wolf stated that [...] "while it appears that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rove</b> will not be called to answer in criminal court for his participation in the wrongful disclosure of Valerie Wilson's classified employment status at the CIA, that obviously does not end the matter. The day still may come when <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rove</b> and others are called to account {{in a court of}} law for their attacks on the Wilsons." ...|$|E

Before Mrs. Porter's disgusted gaze he drained the glass and then turned to her, a new man.|$|R

50|$|An {{editorial}} in the Washington Post reads:The special counsel was principally investigating whether any official violated a law {{that makes it a}} crime to knowingly disclose the identity of an undercover agent. The public record offers no indication that Mr. Libby or any other official deliberately exposed Ms. Plame to punish her husband, former ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV. Rather, Mr. Libby and other officials, including Karl Rove, the White House deputy chief of staff, apparently were seeking to combat the sensational allegations of a critic. They may have believed that Ms. Plame's involvement was an important part of their story of why Mr. Wilson was sent to investigate claims that Iraq sought uranium ore from Niger, and why his subsequent — and mostly erroneous — allegations that the administration twisted that small part of the case against Saddam Hussein should not be credited. To criminalize such discussions between officials and reporters would run counter to the public interest.... That said, the charges Mr. Fitzgerald brought against Mr. Libby are not technicalities. According to the indictment, Mr. Libby lied to both the FBI and a grand jury. No responsible prosecutor would overlook a pattern of deceit like that alleged by Mr. Fitzgerald. The prosecutor was asked to investigate a serious question, and such obstructions are, as he said yesterday, like throwing sand in the umpire's face. In this case, they seem to have contributed to Mr. Fitzgerald's distressing decision to force a number of journalists to testify about conversations with a confidential source. Both Mr. Libby and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rove</b> appear to have allowed the White House spokesman to put out false information about their involvement.|$|E
5000|$|On May 16, 2006, a {{transcript}} of court proceedings before Judge Reggie B. Walton was released. Libby's lawyers sought communications between Matthew Cooper and Massimo Calabresi, authors of an article published by Time magazine on July 17, 2003, and titled, [...] "A War on Wilson?" [...] Libby's lawyers contend that Massimo called Joe Wilson after Cooper learned from Karl Rove that Wilson's wife worked at the CIA. Libby's lawyers also told the judge they have an e-mail Cooper sent to his editor describing a July 12, 2003, conversation with Libby {{in which there is}} no mention of Plame or her CIA status. An e-mail was sent to Cooper's editor on July 16, 2003, [...] "four days after his conversation with Mr. Libby and 5 days after his conversation with <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rove,</b> about the article they are planning to write in which they are going to mention the wife. And the e-mail says — talks about him having an administration source for the information about Ms. Wilson". Thus, Libby's lawyers sought communications between Massimo and Cooper to determine if Cooper conveyed to Massimo that Libby was a source as well for the information on Wilson's wife:And I submit to Your Honor there is — as you can see, the credibility of Mr. Cooper with respect to his description that Mr. Libby confirmed Ms. Plame's employment by the C.I.A. is going to be very much at issue in this case. And that is what cases are all about, and we should be entitled to anything that Mr. Cooper has said ro that others have said or done, such as Mr. Massimo talking to Mr. Wilson on the basis of what Cooper said. And that kind of information is directly relevant to the cross-examination, and we submit that it should be enforced. And certainly we have established specificity with respec to that. The other thing I would say is this is the first I have heard that Time has a document that refers to Ms. Plame. Now, perhaps, that's Mr. Copper's communication with Mr. Massimo, or perhaps it is Mr. Massimo's notes with Mr. Wilson. I don't know, but certainly if there is a document that does refer to Ms. Plame prior to July 14, we submit that that's relevant and should be produced as well. That's all I have on Time and Cooper, Your Honor.|$|E
