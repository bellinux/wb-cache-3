Created by DiC Animation, with Rintaro directing, and character designs by Shingo Araki; two scripts were written, and one episode was fully animated with a music and sound effects track, but the voice-overs were never recorded. It {{has been suggested that}} the project was stopped due to Leblanc's estate wanting a large amount of money for use of the Lupin name. The single episode was later included in the 2012 Lupin III <b>Master</b> <b>File</b> box set.|$|E

Many companies that have experienced success with continuous auditing recommend that you start small. Select which area of the company poses the greatest risk and where its transactions and control systems are most important to the company for your initial foray into continuous auditing. Automate {{a small number of}} key initial tests, such as comparing your accounts payable vendor <b>master</b> <b>file</b> with the employee address file, to uncover potential policy violations or fraud. Moving forward, increase the tests and gradually expand into other business processes in stages.|$|E

2500|$|OLE allows an editing {{application}} to export {{part of a}} document to another editing application and then import it with additional content. For example, a desktop publishing system might send some text to a word processor or a picture to a bitmap editor using OLE. The main benefit of OLE is to add different kinds of data to a document from different applications, like a text editor and an image editor. This creates a Compound File Binary Format document and a <b>master</b> <b>file</b> to which the document makes reference. Changes to data in the <b>master</b> <b>file</b> immediately affect the document that references it. This is called [...] "linking" [...] (instead of [...] "embedding").|$|E
2500|$|An {{electronic}} trial <b>master</b> <b>file</b> (eTMF) {{is a trial}} <b>master</b> <b>file</b> {{in electronic}} (digital content) format. It {{is a type of}} content management system for the pharmaceutical industry, providing a formalized means of organizing and storing documents, images, and other digital content for pharmaceutical clinical trials that may be required for compliance with government regulatory agencies. The term eTMF encompasses strategies, methods and tools used throughout the lifecycle of the clinical trial regulated content. [...] An eTMF system consists of software and hardware that facilitates the management of regulated clinical trial content. [...] Regulatory agencies have outlined the required components of eTMF systems that use electronic means to store the content of a clinical trial, requiring that they include: [...] Digital content archiving, security and access control, change controls, audit trails, and system validation.|$|E

The metadata applied to documents is recommended be formally defined to ensure consistency across all documents.'

Currently, <b>master</b> <b>files</b> are stored in uncompressed TIFF file format, a format used world wide. 650 TB of storage space will be necessary to store 40 million files in this format.
