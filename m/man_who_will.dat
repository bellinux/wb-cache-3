5|$|Women {{are neither}} victims of {{deceitful}} men nor overdefensive virgins, but individuals who {{can choose to}} 'bestow' their favours on a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> 'enjoy' them. In the earliest examples of the redefinition that develops throughout Fielding's works, virtue is no longer simply virginity, but something malleable and powerful {{in the hands of}} a woman granted the agency and intelligence to determine her own sexuality.|$|E

Desperate to support his pregnant wife Jeannie, he agrees to guide two criminals through the chemical plant where he previously worked {{so that they can}} rob the playing card company next to it. During the planning, the police inform him that his wife has died in a household accident. Grief-stricken, the engineer tries to withdraw from the plan, but the criminals strong-arm him into keeping his commitment to them.|$|E

500|$|The album {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Pete Johnson in the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Dylan is a superbly eloquent {{writer of}} pop and folk songs with an unmatched ability to press complex ideas and iconoclastic philosophy into brief poetic lines and startling images." [...] The editor of Crawdaddy!, Paul Williams, reviewed Blonde on Blonde in July 1966: [...] "It is {{a cache of}} emotion, a well handled package of excellent music and better poetry, blended and meshed and ready {{to become part of}} your reality. Here is a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> speak to you, a 1960s bard with electric lyre and color slides, but a truthful man with x-ray eyes you can look through if you want. All {{you have to do is}} listen." ...|$|E
500|$|In practice, {{even the}} revised design ignored the {{acute-angled}} bastions {{which had been}} introduced in Europe, the round towers creating numerous patches of dead ground around the castle into which its guns could not fire; the high walls presented a greater target, the internal design was complicated and it remained difficult to move around inside the fort. Indeed, the historian Peter Harrington describes the final design as even [...] "more archaic than its predecessor". Chute's role was extended to become the Keeper and Captain of Camber, and the Keeper of the Waters of Camber and Puddle in January 1544, {{for which he was}} paid two shillings a day. Haschenperg left England in disgrace in 1544, facing complaints that he was [...] "a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> pretend more knowledge than he hath indeed".|$|E
500|$|The cricket press {{noticed the}} absence of Crawford and the {{professionals}} from Surrey's team over the following games, and noted that Crawford was now playing club cricket. Meanwhile, Alverstone wrote to Crawford that the Surrey committee fully supported Leveson Gower's decision to omit Rushby and Lees, {{and told him that}} Surrey would not select him again unless he apologised to Leveson Gower. Crawford refused, writing to Alverstone: [...] "I do not know who was responsible for the selection of the second eleven sort of team furnished up for such an important match... There seems to be some impression amongst a few of the Surrey committee that I am some young professional instead of being a young fellow who has had an experience of cricket that has seldom fallen to the lot of anyone, and my request for an alteration of the team should have had some weight". In his History of Cricket, Benny Green describes the letter as evidence of a [...] "literate and quietly self-confident young <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> not easily be manipulated." ...|$|E

500|$|Wisemore is not {{the only}} one to serve as a means to comment on society; the {{characters}} Vermilia and Lady Matchless are used to discuss the proper role of females within society by serving as housewives. The dialogue between the two reveals that females are only in control of the domestic sphere because men have allowed them to dominate in the area. This is not to suggest that Fielding supports the repression of females; instead, women are used as a way to discuss the internal aspects of humans including both emotions and morality. However, feminist critic Jill Campbell points out that Fielding does mock women who abuse their relationship with the internal, emotions, and morality in order to dominate and assume power. Tiffany Potter, another feminist critic, sees gender within the play in a different light; Merital's actions and words show a moderate approach to females, and [...] "Women are neither victims of deceitful men nor overdefensive virgins, but individuals who can choose to 'bestow' their favours on a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> 'enjoy' them." ...|$|E
500|$|John Glover characterizes Lionel as a {{businessman}} who is disappointed with his son. To Glover, Lionel is this [...] "rich and powerful businessman" [...] who sees his son as a [...] "wuss" [...] and [...] "fraidy-cat". It was important to Glover that Lionel appear as human as possible; Glover {{said he does not}} want to simply [...] "twirl [...] mustache". Glover described Lionel as a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> do whatever he needs to do to get what he wants. He characterizes Lionel as an intelligent man who can read people easily. Lionel uses that ability to further his goals. The character can also get past people's defenses and manipulate them. Glover thinks that type of power would be great if it could be used to help someone other than Lionel. Lionel's character is also connoted by the color scheme that surrounds him; the use of cold blue tones helps to evoke the [...] "sinister" [...] nature of the character. Lionel is also often portrayed in front of a white or [...] "clinical blue" [...] background. Lionel's signature mane of hair is used to symbolize his power—by growing it out and refusing to style it, Lionel attempts to show he is so powerful that he can do whatever he wants without any backlash.|$|E
500|$|Adam Baldwin as Jayne Cobb– a mercenary. He and Mal {{met when}} they were on {{opposite}} sides of a dispute; Mal, while held at gunpoint, offered Jayne his own bunk and a higher cut than his current employer, so Jayne switched sides and shot his then-partners. In the original pilot, [...] "Serenity", he intimates to Mal that he did not betray him because [...] "The money wasn't good enough." [...] However, previously he had pointedly asked the Alliance agent whether he would be required to turn on the captain to help him, and in [...] "Ariel" [...] defends his actions in alerting the authorities regarding Simon and River by claiming he had not intended to betray Mal. He is someone who can be depended on in a fight. He tends to act like a [...] "lummox" [...] who thinks he is the smartest person in space, but occasional hints of intelligence peek through this façade, giving the impression that he acts dumber than he is. As Whedon states several times, Jayne is the <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> ask the questions that no one else wants to. Even though he is a macho character, he has shown a particularly intense fear of Reavers, more so {{than the rest of the}} crew. Despite his amoral mercenary persona, he sends a significant portion of his income to his mother, again suggesting that there is more to his character than what he presents to the rest of the crew.|$|E

500|$|Stelter {{described}} Frank and Claire Underwood as a [...] "scheming" [...] couple. Michael Dobbs, {{the author}} of the trilogy of novels upon which the British miniseries is based, compares the compelling nature of their relationship favorably to the characters in the original miniseries, and likens them to Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. Underwood has strong feelings for Claire, and frequently plots with her at night. He says, [...] "I love that woman. I love her more than sharks love blood." [...] While Underwood is Machiavellian, Claire, like Lady Macbeth, encourages her husband to do whatever is necessary to seize power. Hank Stuever of The Washington Post describes her as an ice-queen wife. She encourages his vices while noting her disapproval of his weakness, saying, [...] "My husband doesn’t apologize... even to me." [...] Her overt encouragement gives a credibility to their symbiosis. Smith says [...] "The Underwoods have proven themselves ruthless, manipulative, and robotic in their pursuit and lust of power." [...] Upon viewing a four-episode preview of season 2, Goodman says the series [...] "...sells husband and wife power-at-all-costs couple...as a little too oily and reptilian for anyone's good." [...] Willimon notes that [...] "What's extraordinary about Frank and Claire is there is deep love and mutual respect, but the way they achieve this is by operating on a completely different set of rules {{than the rest of us}} typically do." [...] Los Angeles Times critic Mary McNamara makes the case that House of Cards is a love story on many levels, but most importantly between Underwood and Claire. It is a story about a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> commit any crime imaginable while in pursuit of power and a political wife who gives him the encouragement to pursue that power.|$|E

When she returns to the village, she is paired with a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> be her husband.|$|E
2500|$|Fahey {{was known}} to be hypersensitive to {{criticism}} of his work and was even driven to physical illness by anti-Christian arguments. He avoided social gatherings and was uncomfortable meeting people, which was in part caused by his consistent bouts of migraine. Archbishop McQuaid, despite his severe criticisms of Fahey's writings, described him as [...] "a most exemplary priest, of deep sanctity, and a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> very generously sacrifice his time and health to help anyone: not a small sign of genuine holiness." ...|$|E
