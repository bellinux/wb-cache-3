5|$|As {{a coping}} mechanism, self-harm can become psychologically {{addictive}} because, to the self-harmer, it works; it enables {{him or her}} to deal with intense stress in the current <b>moment.</b> <b>The</b> patterns sometimes created by it, such as specific time intervals between acts of self-harm, can also create a behavioural pattern that can result in a wanting or craving to fulfill thoughts of self-harm.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{statistical}} approaches for unsupervised learning is <b>the</b> method of <b>moments.</b> In <b>the</b> method of <b>moments,</b> <b>the</b> unknown parameters (of interest) in the model are related to <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> {{of one or more}} random variables, and thus, these unknown parameters can be estimated given <b>the</b> <b>moments.</b> <b>The</b> <b>moments</b> are usually estimated from samples empirically. <b>The</b> basic <b>moments</b> are first and second order moments. For a random vector, <b>the</b> first order <b>moment</b> is <b>the</b> mean vector, and <b>the</b> second order <b>moment</b> is <b>the</b> covariance matrix (when the mean is zero). Higher order moments are usually represented using tensors which are the generalization of matrices to higher orders as multi-dimensional arrays.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>moments</b> of <b>the</b> von Mises {{distribution}} {{are usually}} calculated as <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> of <b>the</b> complex exponential z = e'ix {{rather than the}} angle x itself.

5|$|Having already {{released}} precious destroyers for convoy duty, {{they were}} unwilling to further weaken {{the ability of the}} U.S. to defend itself through the scattering of the all-important battle fleet. Furthermore, Admiral Benson was uneasy about the prospect, ever-present in the early 20th century, of a second war breaking out with Japan. For the <b>moment,</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Navy would send destroyers to Europe, but no battleships.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to France2, the Associated Press and Reuters also had camera crews at the junction. They captured brief {{footage of the}} al-Durrahs and Abu Rahma. Abu Rahma was the only journalist to film the <b>moment</b> <b>the</b> al-Durrahs were shot.|$|E

50|$|For {{the second}} and higher <b>moments,</b> <b>the</b> central <b>moment</b> (<b>moments</b> about <b>the</b> mean, with c being the mean) are usually used rather than <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> about zero, because they provide clearer {{information}} about the distribution's shape.|$|R
40|$|For Pitman {{sampling}} formul a {{which is}} a distribution on all unordered partitions of a positive integer, we give <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> of <b>the</b> number of components of the random partition which are <b>the</b> descending factorial <b>moments,</b> <b>the</b> ascending factorial <b>moments</b> and <b>the</b> usual <b>moments.</b> Using them <b>the</b> asymptotic distribution {{of the number of}} components of the random partition is derived. <b>The</b> <b>moments</b> of Pitman sampling formula are also given.

5|$|An {{observance}} is {{held each}} year to remember {{the victims of the}} bombing. An annual marathon draws thousands, and allows runners to sponsor a victim of the bombing. For the tenth anniversary of the bombing, the city held 24days of activities, including a week-long series of events known as the National Week of Hope from April 17 to 24, 2005. As in previous years, the tenth anniversary of the bombing observances began with a service at 9:02a.m., marking the <b>moment</b> <b>the</b> bomb went off, with the traditional 168seconds of silence—onesecond for each person who was killed {{as a result of the}} blast. The service also included the traditional reading of the names, read by children to symbolize the future of Oklahoma City.|$|E

5|$|Cavities are {{in great}} demand for nesting by other cavity nesters, so {{woodpeckers}} face {{competition for the}} nesting sites they excavate from the <b>moment</b> <b>the</b> hole becomes usable. This may come from other species of woodpecker, or other cavity nesting birds like swallows and starlings. Woodpeckers may aggressively harass potential competitors, and also use other strategies to reduce the chance of being usurped from their nesting site; for example the red-crowned woodpecker digs its nest in the underside of a small branch, which reduces the chance that a larger species will take it over and expand it.|$|E
5|$|Descent 3 {{takes place}} in a science fiction setting of the Solar System where the player is cast as Material Defender MD1032, a {{mercenary}} working for a corporation called the Post Terran Mining Corporation (PTMC). The game begins moments after the events of Descent II, with the Material Defender escaping the destruction of a planetoid where he was clearing PTMC's robots infected by an alien virus. He was about to return to Earth to collect his reward, but a malfunction occurred with the prototype warp drive in the ship he was piloting, making it drift towards the Sun's atmosphere. At the very last <b>moment,</b> <b>the</b> Material Defender is rescued via a tractor beam by an organization known as the Red Acropolis Research Team.|$|E
5|$|From the <b>moment</b> <b>the</b> egg is hatched, {{the male}} {{macaroni}} penguin cares {{for the newly}} hatched chick. For about 23 to 25 days, the male protects its offspring and helps to keep it warm, since {{only a few of}} its feathers have grown in by this time. The female brings food to the chick every one to two days. When they are not being protected by the adult male penguins, the chicks form crèches to keep warm and stay protected. Once their adult feathers have grown in at about 60 to 70days, they are ready to go out to sea on their own.|$|E

It {{is clear}} how the {{operation}} of deconvolution {{can be viewed as}} operating on the moments: explicit expression for <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> of <b>the</b> Gram matrices associated to our models (sum or product of a deterministic matrix and a complex standard Gaussian matrix) are found, and are expressed in terms of <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> of <b>the</b> matrices involved. Hence, deconvolution means to express <b>the</b> <b>moments,</b> in this case of the deterministic matrices, in function of <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> of <b>the</b> Gram matrices.|$|R
40|$|We {{show how}} all global Wigner {{distribution}} moments of arbitrary order {{can be measured}} as intensity <b>moments</b> in <b>the</b> output plane of an appropriate number of fractional Fourier transform systems (generally anamorphic ones), and we derive the minimum number of (anamorphic) fractional power spectra that are needed for the determination of these <b>moments.</b> <b>The</b> results follow directly from the general relationship that expresses <b>the</b> intensity <b>moments</b> in <b>the</b> output plane of an anamorphic fractional Fourier transform system in terms of <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> in <b>the</b> input plane and the two angles. They can also be derived by formulating rotation-type input-output-relationships between certain combinations of <b>moments.</b> <b>The</b> latter method yields, as a by-product, a number of moment combinations that are invariant under anamorphic fractional Fourier transformation...|$|R

Strindberg took about 200 photos with his seven-kilogram (15lb) camera {{over the course of the}} three months they spent on the pack ice, one of the most famous being his picture of Andrée and Frænkel contemplating the fallen Eagle (see image above).|$|E
5|$|Hearing {{the shots}} from the {{northern}} side of the river, Forbes uneasily moved towards the southern bank, intending to cross and help Wilson. However, Forbes's fears of an ambush proved to be well-founded; at an opportune <b>moment,</b> <b>the</b> Matabele in the scrub opened fire, catching the column in the open. The ambushers' shots were initially wild and inaccurate, but they soon began to focus their fire on the exposed Maxim guns and horses, forcing the troopers to retreat to cover. Five Company soldiers were injured. The resulting skirmish lasted about an hour, by which time the Shangani had been severely swollen by heavy rains upstream, causing it to flood.|$|E

At that <b>moment,</b> <b>the</b> heroes are able to travel to Ultimecia's distant future and defeat her. After the final battle, the defeated Ultimecia transfers her powers to Edea.|$|E
50|$|Antiferromagnets, like ferrimagnets, {{have two}} sublattices with {{opposing}} <b>moments,</b> but now <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> are equal in magnitude.

We {{develop a}} method to compute <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> of <b>the</b> {{eigenvalue}} densities of matrices in the Gaussian, Laguerre and Jacobi ensembles for all the symmetry classes β ∈ { 1, 2, 4 } and finite matrix dimension n. <b>The</b> <b>moments</b> of <b>the</b> Jacobi ensembles have a physical interpretation as <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> of <b>the</b> transmission eigenvalues of an electron through a quantum dot with chaotic dynamics. For the Laguerre ensemble we also evaluate the finite n negative moments. Physically, they correspond to <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> of <b>the</b> proper delay times, which are the eigenvalues of the Wigner-Smith matrix.

5|$|In {{ferromagnetic}} {{elements such}} as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic <b>moment.</b> <b>The</b> orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an exchange interaction. When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. Paramagnetic materials have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up {{in the presence of}} a field.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{a number}} of programs, such as the IAI Harpy or the AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow, {{integrated}} anti-radiation sensors into a drone or missile air frames coupled with command and control and loitering capabilities. This allowed the attacking force to place relatively cheap munitions in place over suspected SAM sites, and to attack promptly the <b>moment</b> <b>the</b> SAM battery is visible. This integrated {{the use of a}} drone as a baiting decoy with the attack role into one small and relatively cheap platform in comparison to the alternative wild weasel jet fighter.|$|E
