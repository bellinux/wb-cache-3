40|$|Abstract — Helical gears are {{commonly}} used in industry as they have advantages of higher power density, quieter operation etc., compared to spur gears. Conventional gear design is based on various design criteria, including durability and bending strength load rating. In recent times, fracture failure modes are gaining importance in addition to conventional failure modes. Stresses due to operating fatigue loads and internal residual stresses can cause fatigue fracture failure on the surface, sub-surface of gear flanks or at tooth root of gears. During gear design, various parameters are optimized, and one such parameter is the <b>helix</b> <b>angle</b> that is optimized for power density and gear noise. However, effect of possible defects (voids and inclusions) in the gear tooth is not usually considered in these calculations. This paper is a study on severity of defects in a gear blank relative to power density increment. Three different gear geometries (spur and helical gears with two different <b>helix</b> <b>angles)</b> each with similar defects are considered. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is used to analyze Tooth Interior Fracture (TIF), and study variation of Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) with crack size and <b>helix</b> <b>angle.</b> It is seen that power density increment of a common gear blank through <b>helix</b> <b>angle</b> increment poses {{a higher risk of}} crack severity, as the same gear blank is exposed to higher operating loads.

The stress-strain response {{of a single}} fascicle whose fibrils exhibit varying levels of crimp throughout its radius is calculated and {{used to determine the}} form of the strain energy function. The new constitutive law is used to model uniaxial extension test data for human patellar tendon and is shown to provide an excellent fit, with the average relative error being 9. 8 %. It is then used to model shear and predicts that the stresses required to shear a tendon are much smaller than those required to uniaxially stretch it to the same strain level. Finally, the strain energy function is used to model ligaments and tendons whose fascicles are helical, and the relative effects of the fibril <b>helix</b> <b>angle,</b> the fascicle <b>helix</b> <b>angle</b> and the fibril crimp variable are compared.

With the use of diffusion tensor fiber tracking, left ventricle (LV) myocardial fiber pathways and <b>helix</b> <b>angles</b> were computed pixel by pixel at short-axis slices from base to apex. Distribution of DTI-tracked fiber pathway length and number was analyzed quantitatively as a function of fiber <b>helix</b> <b>angle</b> in step of 9 °.

Fiber pathways tracked at the middle and upper LV are generally longer than those near the apex. Majority of fiber pathways have small <b>helix</b> <b>angles</b> between - 20 ° and 20 °, dominating the fiber architecture in myocardium. Likely, such myocardial fiber pathway measurement by DTI may reflect the spatial connectiveness or connectivity of elastic myofiber bundles along their preferential pathway of electromechanical activation.
