40|$|The {{modeling}} of TCP transfer latency has received significant {{attention in the}} last decade. Several models have been proposed for TCP performance under various conditions. All the available models predict TCP performance for a single link. Furthermore, all models relate timeouts to packet drops either due to congestion or due to transmission errors. However, TCP connections may be running over a multilink connection that aggregates the bandwidth of multiple links into a single logical pipe using the <b>multilink</b> <b>point-to-point</b> <b>protocol</b> (MLPPP). In such aggregate links, packet drops occur {{if any of the}} individual links experience a call drop. None of the available models account for call drops as a possible source of performance degradation. In this letter, we study the call drop phenomenon under MLPPP and incorporate our results into a method that predicts TCP latency for a long transfer. The performance model is experimentally evaluated by running TCP over MLPPP over multiple Iridium satellite links...|$|E

Roaming between heterogeneous wireless networks, with different link layers, is therefore possible with this IP mobility support. However, problems arise when incompatible link layers, which could not integrate well with Mobile IP to support seamless handover, are used. In this paper, a Wireless LAN and Bluetooth heterogeneous environment was set up with Mobile IP to demonstrate the problems when the <b>Point-to-Point</b> <b>Protocol</b> is the Bluetooth's link layer.
