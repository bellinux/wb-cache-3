5|$|Rhys tries {{unsuccessfully to}} get Robbie O'Brien (Shaun Goss) {{to quit the}} {{surgical}} program. He then turns his attention to Erin Salisbury (Elise Jansen) and plots to take her spot on the program instead. He pursues Erin romantically and tries to distract her away from her work, so she will be kicked off the program and he can take her place. Barber said the scheme sees Rhys at his manipulative best, he realises Erin is vulnerable and he strikes. Jansen told a writer for TV Week that Erin is a bit reluctant to accept when Rhys asks her out. She thinks that someone like Rhys would not normally be interested in her, but she is flattered by the attention. Jansen added Erin is unaware it is all an act. Kate realises what Rhys is doing and interferes with his plan. Barber explained that Kate's feelings about the matter <b>means</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> Rhys as his sole objective is {{to get into the}} program. He does not mind that Kate is appalled at Erin becoming a casualty of his scheme.|$|E

Two rival gangs, seeking {{to settle debts}} with Han, board and attack, but Han and his allies flee in the Falcon. The gangs inform the First Order. At the First Order's Starkiller Base – a planet converted into a superweapon that harnesses energy from stars – Supreme Leader Snoke orders General Hux to use the weapon for the first time. Snoke questions Ren's {{ability to deal with}} emotions relating to his father, Han Solo; Ren says Solo <b>means</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E
25|$|The film {{begins in}} a Los Angeles diner where a {{waitress}} named Slim (Jennifer Lopez) works with her best friend, Ginny (Juliette Lewis). She receives unwelcome romantic advances from Robbie, a customer who teases {{her about her}} name. Another man in the diner, Mitch Hiller (Billy Campbell), reveals that the customer had made a bet {{that he would be}} able to convince Slim to sleep with him. Soon after, Slim falls in love with and marries Mitch, and they have a child named Gracie (Tessa Allen). Years later, Slim finds out Mitch has been cheating on her with a French woman named Darcelle. She confronts him and he admits it, but also insisting Darcelle <b>means</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> him. Slim becomes angry and threatens to leave, which enrages Mitch, who becomes violent, slapping and punching her in the face. He gives her a warning, saying that he makes the money and gets to do whatever he likes, implying he wants an open marriage. Mitch refuses to stop his affair unless she wants to fight him. The next day, Slim confides in Mitch's mother (Janet Carroll); she asks Slim what she did to make Mitch angry, implying he has a history of physical abuse. Ginny advises Slim to leave and imprison Mitch, but Slim does not want to hurt Gracie. She then goes to pick up Gracie from school, only to discover Mitch had already picked her up. Panicked that Mitch might have left town with her, she calls Mitch, who tells her that he took Gracie to the zoo.|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{also spoke}} about O'Neal in 2001 with Rabbi Shmuley. He {{described}} holding hands with her: [...] "I was, like, in heaven. It {{was the most}} magical thing. It was better than kissing her, {{it was better than}} anything." [...] He recalled one of the times they held hands:I remember we went to this club, and I don't go to clubs, which was called the Roxy. And I was watching the band, I was sitting there, and underneath the table, she was holding my hand, and I was, like melting. [...] Fireworks going off. It was all I needed. But that <b>means</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> kids today. She grew up too fast. She wasn't into innocence, and I love that.|$|E
2500|$|Then, in 1983, Phil had UK {{success as}} a soloist with the album Phil Everly, {{recorded}} mainly in London.

2500|$|Despite this, {{other members}} of both groups appear to have {{remained}} on good terms since the initial controversy. Regarding the perceived conflict, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea stated [...] "There was never any fight between us, that {{was a bunch of}} bullshit created by the media. I mean I think they're a good band. Maybe there was some things said between Anthony and the singer , but it all <b>means</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> me. Those guys in the band are nice people and there's no fight." [...] At a 2014 show in Brooklyn, the band also notably covered a portion of the Chuck Mosley-era song [...] "We Care a Lot".|$|E

2500|$|Queen Morgana - The game's main antagonist, Morgana is King Arthur's immoral {{half-sister}} who constantly conspires {{against him}} and desires to be the ruler of all Albion. She is a witch of great dark power who once learnt much of her sorcery from Merlin himself, but now she and Merlin are bitter rivals and their past intimacy <b>means</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> them. Morgana has made many attempts on Arthur's life and is rumoured to be behind many mysterious deaths and disappearances, but never has left any trace of her involvement. A lascivious femme fatale of great beauty, Morgana {{is a master of}} intrigue and deception, and even without her magical powers she would make a dangerous adversary. Like Merlin, Morgana [...] is semi-immortal, which requires Gawain to magically trap her soul in order to defeat her.|$|E

After a series of severe coughs and almost fainting, Violetta begins to feel dizzy and asks her guests to go ahead and to leave her to rest until she recovers. While the guests dance in the next room, Violetta looks at her pale face in her mirror. Alfredo enters and expresses his concern for her fragile health, later declaring his love for her (Alfredo, Violetta: Un dì, felice, eterea – [...] "One day, happy and ethereal"). At first, she rejects him because his love <b>means</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> her, but there is something about Alfredo that touches her heart. He is about to leave when she gives him a flower, telling him to return it when it has wilted, which will be the very next day.|$|E

2500|$|Agnese appears, {{this time}} singing for a yet-unnamed love: Aria: Silenzio – E notte intorno / [...] "Silence and night all around. May {{the voice of}} the lute guide you to me, my love". [...] As she hopes that the {{anonymous}} letter, which she has sent, and now her song will guide him to her arms, Orombello suddenly appears, but he is attracted only by the sounds of sweet music. Since the letter was written to him, she assumes an attraction to her on his part, and he is somewhat confused over this turn of events. Somewhat bluntly, she moves towards asking if he is in love, and he decides to confide in her. He confesses that he is deeply in love and, when asked about a letter which she assumes to be the one she wrote to him, he reveals that he had written to Beatrice. At that point, she realises that she has a rival: (Duet: Sì: rivale… rival regnante / [...] "A royal rival"). Agnese's expectations collapse as Orombello reveals that it Beatrice with whom he is in love and he pleads for her to understand. She is furious; her tenderness turns to vitriol and in a dramatic finale, she explodes while he attempts to protect Beatrice's honour – and her life: (Duet: La sua vita? Ma la sola, ohime! / [...] "Her life? My life <b>means</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> you?").|$|E
2500|$|Yet {{it would}} be a mistake to {{conclude}} that Ivar was nothing but a crook. Reality was more nuanced. For one thing disclosure rules in his days were much less stringent. Many corporations refused to reveal details for fear competitors would gain an advantage. (At least that was the claim often made.) [...] Some firms did not even publish quarterly results. Ivar, too, was very secretive and not only with investors. When he was on the verge of hiring somebody he usually asked: [...] "Can he keep a secret?" [...] He was also very fond of quoting his motto for success: [...] "Silence, more silence, and still more silence." [...] Also one cannot fault him for the speculative fever in the 1920s. Without the hunger for ever larger profits many of Ivar's schemes would not have been possible. Incidentally this facilitated a transfer of capital from the USA to Europe where it was, often desperately, needed. He sold shares in the USA worth 250 million dollars (equivalent to c. 3.75 billion today) and transferred almost all of it to his holding company in Liechtenstein, Continental Investment Corporation. Shareholders of International Match had given him authority to do this so there was nothing wrong with it. There was also a tax advantage because of the advantageous deal he had negotiated with Liechtenstein. But Ivar did it above all to have the flexibility to manipulate balance sheets and financial statements so they would look more attractive to investors as well as helping him – to some extent - pay the high dividends of Swedish Match and Kreuger & Toll. He got the nickname [...] "Saviour of Europe" [...] by lending about $400 million (equivalent to c. $6 billion today) to rebuild their shattered economies after World War I. He invented new financial instruments to help him raise funds and, of course, make him money. Indeed, many consider Ivar to be the father of modern financial schemes. Oscar Rydbeck, his Swedish banker, said Ivar was the third richest man in the world. He, however, claimed [...] "money as such <b>means</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> me". Ivar was also a successful speculator for much of his life making lots of money until shortly before the end. Trying to support the collapsing share prices of many of his companies (including ways which were—if not illegal—questionable, e.g. using straw men for share transactions. In the case of his acquisition of Diamond Match shares it was clearly illegal because of anti-trust laws.) ...|$|E
