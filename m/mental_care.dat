It was Fitzgerald's first novel in nine years and the last that he would complete. The early 1930s, when Fitzgerald conceived the book, were the darkest years of his life, and the novel's bleakness reflects his own experiences.

6000|$|A large lumber sleigh, {{drawn by}} four horses, was soon seen dashing through the {{leafless}} bushes which fringed the road. The leaders were of gray, and the pole-horses of a jet-black. Bells innumerable were suspended from {{every part of}} the harness where one of the tinkling balls could be placed, while the rapid movement of the equipage, in defiance of the steep ascent, announced the desire of the driver to ring them to the utmost. The first glance at this singular arrangement acquainted the Judge with the character of those in the sleigh. It contained four male figures. On one of those stools that are used at writing desks, lashed firmly to the sides of the vehicle, was seated a little man, enveloped in a great-coat fringed with fur, in such a manner that no part of him was visible, except a face of an unvarying red color. There was an habitual upward look about the head of this gentleman, as if dissatisfied with its natural proximity to the earth; and the expression of his countenance was that of busy care, He was the charioteer, and he guided the mettled animals along the precipice with a fearless eye and a steady hand, Immediately behind him, with his face toward the other two, was a tall figure, to whose appearance not even the duplicate overcoats which he wore, aided by the corner of a horse-blanket, could give the appearance of strength. His face was protruding from beneath a woollen night cap; and, when he turned to the vehicle of Marmaduke as the sleighs approached each other, it seemed formed by nature to cut the atmosphere with the least possible resistance. The eyes alone appeared to create any obstacle, for from either side of his forehead their light-blue, glassy balls projected. The sallow of his countenance was too permanent to be affected even by the intense cold of the evening. Opposite to this personage sat a solid, short, and square figure. No part of his form was to be discovered through his overdress, but a face that was illuminated by a pair of black eyes that gave the lie to every demure feature in his countenance. A fair, jolly wig furnished a neat and rounded outline to his visage, and he, well as the other two, wore marten-skin caps. The fourth was a meek- looking, long-visaged man, without any other protection from the cold than that which was furnished by a black surcoat, made with some little formality, but which was rather threadbare and rusty. He wore a hat of extremely decent proportions, though frequent brushing had quite destroyed its nap. His face was pale, and withal a little melancholy, or what might be termed of a studious complexion. The air had given it, just now, a light and somewhat feverish flush, The character of his whole appearance, especially contrasted to the air of humor in his next companion, was that of habitual <b>mental</b> <b>care.</b> No sooner had the two sleighs approached within speaking distance, than the driver of this fantastic equipage shouted aloud ...|$|E

Method: A survey conducted amongst 2757 GPs regarding collaboration, barriers regarding collaboration and task performance. Multiple regression analysis (stepwise) was performed to see which factores influence collaboration. Results: 1336 questionnaires were returned and 1196 questionnaires were analysed. Less {{than half of the}} GPs were informed about different aspects of specialised <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> providers. Only a quarter or less of the GPs consulted frequently with the different <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> providers but a quarter or more had never consulted with them. GPs experienced more barriers with specialised <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> providers than with primary <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> providers. Long waiting lists and insufficient possibilities for conjoint treatment were the most important barriers. Collaboration was enhanced by the presence of a contact person and the appreciation of information given by <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> providers. Barriers associated with collaboration had a negative influence. Conclusion: Collaboration can be improved. To do so, information about <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> towards GPs has to be improved as well as consultation with different <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> providers. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|Current <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> {{policy in}} The Netherlands {{emphasizes}} {{a major shift}} from intramural to extramural care.

To allow for such a far reaching change, fortification of the greatly fragmented non-residential sector of Dutch <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> was necessary (in 1982 more than 300 agencies {{in a country of}} 14. 5 million inhabitants).

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of organizational culture and climate on the access to <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> for 588 children referred to child welfare and juvenile justice systems in 21 Tennessee urban and rural counties. Cross-level, hierarchical linear models (HLM) analyses indicated that children served by child welfare and juvenile justice case management units with constructive organizational cultures were more likely to receive the needed <b>mental</b> health <b>care.</b> For example, controlling for the child’s need for <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> and other child and family characteristics, the odds of a child receiving <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> in a case management unit with the most constructive culture were 11 times the odds of receiving <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> in a unit with the least constructive culture. Constructive cultures were characterized by organizational norms and expectations that case managers would be mutually supportive, develop their individual abilities, maintain positive interpersonal relationships, and be motivated to succeed. These findings suggest that efforts to improve access to <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> for children referred to child welfare and juvenile systems should include the development of constructive organizational cultures in case management units responsible for the children’s care.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Specific {{problems}} in sampling methodology, case-finding strategies and a standardised needs assessment in mentally ill homeless people {{have contributed to}} their being neglected as a <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> clientele. METHOD: We assessed {{a representative sample of}} homeless people (n= 102) in the highly industrialised city of Mannheim (Germany) regarding their prevalence of mental disorders (using the SCID) and their needs for <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> (using the NCA). RESULTS: We found high prevalences, with 68. 6 % of all assessed homeless persons having a current mental disorder. Thus, needs for <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> were very common, with unmet needs predominating in all problem areas, which was supported by a very weak service utilization. Thus, even in a region with a comprehensive community <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> network, like the study area, mentally ill homeless people are widely under-provided. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the traditional shelter system for homeless people carries most of the <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> burden for their clientele and must be supported by adequate interventions from community-based <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> services. A closer connection of both sectors and a better co-ordination of the care offers seems to be a prerequisite for helping to reduce unmet <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> needs in this specific high-risk group...|$|R

40|$|Purpose Description and {{analysis}} of the effects and side-effects of integrated <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> in the Netherlands. Context of case Due to a number of large-scale mergers, Dutch <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> has become an illustration of integration and coherence of care services. This process of integration, however, has not only brought a better organisation of care but apparently has also resulted in a number of serious side-effects. This has raised the question whether integration is still the best way of reorganising <b>mental</b> health <b>care.</b> Data sources Literature, data books, patients and professionals, the advice of the Dutch Commission for <b>Mental</b> Health <b>Care,</b> and policy papers. Case description Despite its organisational and patient-centred integration, the problems in the Dutch <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> system have not diminished: long waiting lists, insufficient fine tuning of care, public order problems with chronic psychiatric patients, etc. These problems are related to a sharp {{rise in the number of}} <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> registrations in contrast with a decrease of registered patients in first-level services. This indicates that care for people with mental health problems has become solely a task for the <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> services (monopolisation). At the same time, integrated institutions have developed in the direction of specialised medical care (homogenisation). Monopolisation and homogenisation together have put the integrated institutions into an impossible divided position. Conclusions and discussion Integration of care within the institutions in the Netherlands has resulted in withdrawal of other care providers. These side-effects lead to a new discussion on the real nature and benefits of an integrated <b>mental</b> health <b>care</b> system. Integration requires also a broadly shared vision on good care for the various target groups. This would require a radicalisation of the distinction between care providers as well as a recognition of the different goals of <b>mental</b> health <b>care.</b> </p...|$|R
