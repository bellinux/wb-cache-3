40|$|An Appendix II listing is {{proposed}} for the <b>Malayan</b> <b>Giant</b> <b>Turtle</b> (Orlitia borneensis); the species meets the criteria in Resolution Conf. 9. 24, as outlined below. Inclusion of Orlitia borneensis in CITES Appendix II is expected {{to result in a}} reduction in international trade in the species, as it affords greater control over imports in recipient Parties and is expected to lead to a higher level of scrutiny of trade levels and the status and biological data used to determine acceptable trade levels through non-detriment findings, quotas and other mechanisms. Listing will also result in jurisdiction over management of the species being shifted to the CITES MA in Indonesia and Malaysia. · Orlitia borneensis inhabits the lowland wetlands of Peninsular Malaysia, Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo), Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) and Sumatra (Indonesia), namely rivers, estuaries, lakes, large vegetation-choked ponds and other large bodies of fresh water. Nesting occurs in loose soil, sandy riverbanks or piles of debris. No information is available on growth rate and age at maturity, and little on reproduction. Females lay a clutch of up to 40 eggs; it is not known whether a female may produce more than one clutch per year. · The 1996 IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals listed Orlitia at Lower Risk: near threatened. In the 2000 IUCN Red List the species was upgraded to Endangered A 1 cd+ 2 cd, reflecting current levels o...|$|E
