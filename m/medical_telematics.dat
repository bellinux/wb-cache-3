OSGi facilitates the development of application modules at the knowledge level thus encouraging quick creation and prototyping of services. In this paper, we have built a prototype application for use in <b>Medical</b> <b>Telematics</b> to provide remotely placed doctors at hospitals with patient FIRs to enable supervised emergency medical care by paramedics even before the patients reach the hospitals...|$|E
