40|$|A {{complicated}} {{ecosystem interaction}} is impacting South African abalone Haliotis midae and rock lobsters Jasus lalandii along the East of Hangklip (EoH) coastline. The lobsters have dramatically reduced sea urchin Parechinus angulosus populations, thereby indirectly negatively impacting juvenile abalone, which {{rely on the}} urchins for shelter. This ecosystem change effect is incorporated in the spatial and age-structured assessment model for abalone, with model projections predicting steep declines in abalone spawning biomass in the lobster-infected areas. In practice, multi-species considerations have been incorporated in an ad hoc manner only in the assessment, because of the difficulties both in the conceptualisation and parameterisation of a more complicated <b>multi-species</b> <b>model</b> capable of explicitly representing the various interactions. However, a preliminary abaloneurchin-lobster <b>multi-species</b> <b>model</b> has been developed {{as a first step}} to explore the problem, to investigate the data needs and to test the potential sensitivity of model results to the choice of parameter values. Indications from preliminary investigations were that the predicted recovery of the abalone resource may be slower than that predicted by a model that does not explicitly take the various interactions into account...|$|E

40|$|The hake {{fishery is}} South Africa's most {{valuable}} and harvests two morphologically similar species, the shallow- water Cape hake Merluccius capensis and the deep-water Cape hake M. paradoxus. Since 1948, annual catches have exceeded 50 000 tons {{and the current}} total allowable catch (TAC) is about 150 000 tons, a quantity informed by assessments of the hake resource. Current assessments on which management is based use single-stock models that ignore food-web effects. Usually including such interactions in assessments is problematic because {{of the complexity of}} food webs. In the case of Cape hake, however, cannibalism and inter-species predation form a very large component of hake mortality and food consumption, thus making a <b>multi-species</b> <b>model</b> not only more feasible but also likely more reliable. A comprehensive <b>multi-species</b> <b>model</b> incorporating these interactions was last investigated in 1995. Since then, substantially more data have become available, and hake single-species assessments have developed considerably, inter alia now including the ability to take careful account of species differentiation. Additionally, with increased computer processing power, more sophisticated modelling can now be attempted than was possible 20 years ago, rendering an update and refinement of the 1995 analyses timeous. The thesis uses mathematical methods to model hake-on-hake predation and cannibalism in hake populations explicitly by incorporating an additional mortality term to account for these interactions. Information from stomach samples obtained on hake research surveys on predator and prey lengths, {{as well as on the}} proportion of hake in the diet of hake predators, is then included when fitting the model to data. Chapter 1 contains a brief introduction to the work. Chapter 2 provides background information on the Cape hake fishery and its management, as well as pertinent information on the biology and diet of the hake (and related fish) from the literature that is relevant to the development of the model constructed in this thesis. Chapter 3 lays out the data available for assessing the Cape hake populations: abundance indices together with catch and catch-at-size data for the standard non-predation model, and hake stomach content data for the years 1999 - 2013 to inform the predation component of <b>multi-species</b> <b>model</b> developed. Chapter 4 provides the details for the standard hake assessment model used at present to inform management of the stocks. This model forms the basis for the <b>multi-species</b> <b>model</b> developed incorporating predation, which is presented in Chapter 5.

40|$|State-space {{modelling}} is {{a powerful}} tool to study ecological systems. The direct inclusion of uncertainty, unification of models and data, and ability to model unobserved, hidden states increases our knowledge about the environment and provides new ecological insights. I extend the state-space framework to create <b>multi-species</b> <b>models,</b> showing {{that the ability to}} model ecosystem interactions is limited only by data availability. State-space models are fit using both Bayesian and Frequentist methods, making them independent of a statistical school of thought. Bayesian approaches can have the advantage in their ability to account for missing data and fit hierarchical structures and models with many parameters to limited data; often the case in ecological studies. I have taken a Bayesian model fitting approach in this thesis. The predator-prey interactions between the hen harrier (Circus cyaneus) and red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) are used to demonstrate state-space modelling’s capabilities. The harrier data are believed to be known without error, while missing data make the cyclic dynamics of the grouse harder to model. The grouse-harrier interactions are <b>modelled</b> in a <b>multi-species</b> state-space <b>model,</b> rather than including one species as a covariate in the other’s model. Finally, models are included for the harriers’ alternate prey. The single- and <b>multi-species</b> state-space <b>models</b> for the predator-prey interactions provide insight into the species’ management. The models investigate aspects of the species’ behaviour, from the mechanisms behind grouse cycles to what motivates harrier immigration. The inferences drawn from these models are applicable to management, suggesting actions to halt grouse cycles or mitigate the grouse-harrier conflict. Overall, the <b>multi-species</b> <b>models</b> suggest that two popular ideas for grouse-harrier management, diversionary feeding and habitat manipulation to reduce alternate prey densities, will not have the desired effect, {{and in the case of}} reducing prey densities, may even increase the harriers’ impact on grouse chicks.

40|$|Aim: Species {{distribution}} {{models are}} increasingly {{used to predict}} the impacts of global change on whole ecological communities by modelling the individualistic niche responses {{of large numbers of}} species. However, {{it is not clear whether}} this single-species ensemble approach is preferable to community-wide strategies that represent interspecific associations or shared responses to environmental gradients. Here, we test the performance of two <b>multi-species</b> <b>modelling</b> approaches against equivalent single-species models. Location: Great Britain. Methods: Single- and <b>multi-species</b> distribution <b>models</b> were fitted for 701 native British plant species at a 10 -km grid scale. Two machine learning methods were used – classification and regression trees (CARTs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). The single-species versions are widely used in ecology but their multivariate extensions are less well known and have not previously been evaluated against one another. We compared their abilities to predict species distributions, community compositions and species richness in an independent geographical region reserved from model-fitting. Results: The single- and <b>multi-species</b> <b>models</b> performed similarly, although the community models gave slightly poorer predictive accuracy by all measures. However, from the point of view of the whole community they were much simpler than the array of single-species models, involving orders of magnitude fewer parameters. Multi-species approaches also left greater residual spatial autocorrelation than the individualistic models and, contrary to expectation, were relatively less accurate for rarer species. However, the fitted multi-species response curves had lower tendency for pronounced discontinuities that are unlikely to be a feature of realized niche responses. Main conclusions: Although community distribution models were slightly less accurate than single-species models, they offered a highly simplified way of modelling spatial patterns in British plant diversity. Moreover, an advantage of the multi-species approach was that the modelling of shared environmental responses resolved more realistic response curves. However, there was a slight tendency for community models to predict rare species less accurately, which is potentially disadvantageous for conservation applications. We conclude that <b>multi-species</b> distribution <b>models</b> may have potential for understanding and predicting the structure of ecological communities, but were slightly inferior to single-species ensembles for our data. ...|$|R

Both pollinators are different: the large pollinator can consume all the nectar offered by the plant in each visit; it permits the genetic interchange between plants from different patches, so, it avoids self-fertilization problems. The small pollinator consumes {{only a fraction of}} the flower nectar but the seeds produced by its pollination are less successful. The model gives different dynamics depending on both the differences between the pollinators ’ growth rates and the inbreeding effect. Stronger oscillations occur when the growth rates are very different. Paradoxically, a high inbreeding causes an increment in populations. The three species system is biologically stable and the asymmetry between pollinator species results in different roles that enhance the global stability and persistence of the system...|$|E

Over {{the last four years}} the exploitable biomass trend is upwards for Areas 7 and 8 and the resource as a whole, but downwards for Areas 5 + 6 and almost level for Areas 1 + 2 and 3 + 4. The overall increase since 2006 is significant at the 5 % level. While better than median projections at the time the current OMP developed, the increase remains within the 95 % probability intervals calculated at the time. An updated version of the Spatial <b>Multi-species</b> Operating <b>Model</b> (SMOM) of krillpredator-fishery dynamics is described. This has been developed in response to requests for scientific advice regarding the subdivision of the precautionary catch limit for krill among 15 small-scale management units (SSMUs) in the Scotia Sea, to reduce the potential impact of fishing on land-based predators. 2. The numerous uncertainties regarding the appropriate choice of parameter values in <b>multi-species</b> <b>models</b> is a major impediment. A pragmatic method proposed involves use of an operating model comprising alternative combinations that essentially try to bound the uncertainty in, for example, the choice of survival rate estimates as well as the functional relationships between predators and prey. 3. The operating model is assumed to simulate the “true” dynamics of the resource and is used to test decision rules for adjusting fishing activities (e. g. catch limits) based on field data forthcoming in the future. 4. An illustrative Management Procedure (MP) that includes a feedback structure is shown to perform better in terms of low risk to predators within each SSMU, than an approach lacking the ability to react and self-correct. 5. This modeling framework provides an example of a method for bounding some of the uncertainty associated with <b>multi-species</b> <b>models</b> used for management. Results are presented as probability envelopes rather than in point estimate form, giving a truer reflection of the uncertainty inherent in outcomes predicted on the basis of <b>multi-species</b> <b>models,</b> as well as highlighting how such probability envelopes could be narrowed given improved data on key parameters such as survival. Results are useful for evaluating the relative merits of different spatial allocations of krill catches.

Further, host species identity drives high variability in pathogen transmission in depauperate communities, but this effect diminishes as host richness accumulates. Using simulation we show that high variability in low richness communities and the non-monotonic relationship observed with host community saturation may reduce the detectability of trends in empirical data.

We developed and tested a biomass-specific, <b>multi-species</b> <b>model</b> to examine the role of PSFs in diversity–productivity relationships. The model predicts a negative relationship between PSFs and overyielding: plants with negative PSFs grow more in communities than in monoculture (i. e. overyield), and plants with positive PSFs grow less in communities than in monoculture (i. e. underyield). This effect is predicted to increase with diversity and saturate at low species richness because the proportion of ‘self-cultivated’ soils rapidly decreases as species are added to a community. Results {{in a set of}} glasshouse experiments supported model predictions. We found that PSFs measured in one experiment were negatively correlated with overyielding in three-species plant communities measured in a separate experiment. Furthermore, when parametrized with our experimental PSF data, our model successfully predicted species-level overyielding and underyielding.

This paper will provide an explanation of these problems {{which is based on}} <b>multi-species</b> <b>modelling.</b> An overview of a major experimental programme to test and validate the models will be presented. The programme concluded that even in diffusion tests {{in which there is no}} electric field applied or electrical measurements made, there are still significant effects of charge build up from hydroxyl, sodium and potassium ions as well as the chloride...|$|R
