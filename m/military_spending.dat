5|$|At {{the time}} of the North Korean invasion, the closest American ground force was the 24th Infantry Division, which was based in Japan. This {{division}} had fewer than its normal contingent of soldiers, and most of its equipment was rather old due to the U.S. Congress's reductions in <b>military</b> <b>spending.</b> In any case, the 24th Infantry Division was {{the only part of the}} U.S. Army that was available to quickly reinforce South Korea.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, the USSR {{had built up}} a {{military}} arsenal and army surpassing that of the United States. Soon after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, president Carter began massively building up the United States military. This buildup was accelerated by the Reagan administration, which increased the <b>military</b> <b>spending</b> from 5.3 percent of GNP in 1981 to 6.5 percent in 1986, the largest peacetime defense buildup in United States history.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, {{changes in}} {{political}} leadership {{on both sides}} shifted the dynamic of the Cold War. Dwight D. Eisenhower was inaugurated president that January.

5|$|Massachusetts and New Hampshire were on {{the front}} line of the war, yet the New England colonies {{suffered}} less economic damage than other areas.

5|$|By lending his {{prestige}} to Kennan's position, {{the president}} tacitly signaled {{his intention to}} formulate the strategy of his administration {{within the framework of}} its predecessor's, despite the misgivings of some within the Republican Party. The critical difference between the Truman and Eisenhower policies of containment had to do with Eisenhower's concerns that the United States could not indefinitely afford great <b>military</b> <b>spending.</b> The new president thus sought to minimize costs not by acting whenever and wherever the Soviets acted (a strategy designed to avoid risk) but rather whenever and wherever the United States could afford to act.|$|E

Cameroon relies heavily on France for its defence, {{although}} <b>military</b> <b>spending</b> is high in comparison to other sectors of government. Biya has clashed with the government of Nigeria over possession of the oil rich Bakassi peninsula (however, this was resolved with the Greentree Agreement) and with Gabon's president, El Hadj Omar Bongo, over personal rivalries.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The <b>military</b> <b>spends</b> {{billions of}} dollars {{annually}} on inspection, identification, and repair of damage resulting from aircraft corrosion. The currently available methods for identifying aircraft corrosion damage involve expensive, labor intensive scheduled inspections, resulting in longer periods in depot, and reduction in aircraft availability. In order to increase aircraft safety, availability, and operational efficiency, an on-platform monitoring system capable of fusing data streams from an array of environmental and corrosivity sensors is needed to provide inspection-free indicators {{of the existence of}} corrosion as well as the level of corrosive severity in difficult to access aircraft locations. This paper will discuss the design, test, and validation of such a system utilizing a wireless, ultra-low power network of sensors...|$|R
5|$|In February 2010, President Obama {{formed the}} {{bipartisan}} BowlesSimpson Commission to recommend steps {{that could be}} taken to reduce future budget deficits. The commission released its report on November 10, 2010, which recommended deep domestic and <b>military</b> <b>spending</b> cuts, reforming the tax system by eliminating many tax breaks in return for lower overall rates, and reducing benefits for Social Security and Medicare. The plan did not receive the supermajority vote within the commission which {{it needed to be}} directly sent to Congress, and portions of the plan were rejected by both parties.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to calling for cuts in federal government spending {{to help reduce}} the national debt, Romney proposed measures intended to limit the growth of entitlement programs, such as introducing means testing and gradually raising the eligibility ages for receipt of Social Security and Medicare. He supported substantial increases in <b>military</b> <b>spending</b> and promised to invest more heavily in military weapons programs while {{increasing the number of}} active-duty military personnel. He was very supportive of the directions taken by the budget proposals of Paul Ryan, although he later proposed his own budget plan.|$|E
5|$|Over {{his four}} years as Secretary of Defense, Cheney {{downsized}} the military and his budgets showed negative real growth, despite pressures to acquire weapon systems advocated by Congress. The Department of Defense's total obligational authority in current dollars declined from $291 billion to $270 billion. Total military personnel strength decreased by 19 percent, from about 2.2 million in 1989 to about 1.8 million in 1993. Notwithstanding the overall reduction in <b>military</b> <b>spending,</b> Cheney directed {{the development of a}} Pentagon plan to ensure U.S. military dominance in the post-Cold War era.|$|E

5|$|The {{army has}} over 30,350 active {{personnel}} and 3,000,000 fit for military service. <b>Military</b> <b>spending</b> has fluctuated widely {{in recent history}} in response to local conditions, especially the 2005–2010 civil war and instability in neighboring countries. In 2009, while in civil war, Chad spent 4.2% of GDP on defense, which fell to 1.6% of GDP in 2011 before rising to 2.0% of GDP in 2013, when Chad began its military intervention in Northern Mali, as it worked with France and other African nations to bring back Mali's sovereignty over territory in the North.|$|E
5|$|While, unsurprisingly, <b>military</b> <b>spending</b> {{constituted}} the largest {{part of the}} national government's budget {{over the course of the}} war, over time the payment of interest and principal on acquired debt grew as a share of the Confederate government's expenditure. While initially, in early 1861, war expenditure was 95% of the budget, by October 1864 that share fell to 40%, with the majority of the rest (56% overall) being accounted for by debt service. Civilian expenditures and spending on the Navy (recorded separately from general war expenditures in Confederate records) never exceeded 10% of the budget.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, the {{division}} remained on mainland Japan. It occupied Kyūshū from 1945 until 1950. During this time, the US Army shrank. At the end of World War II it contained 89 divisions, but by 1950, the 24th Infantry Division was one of only 10 active divisions in the force. It was one of four understrength divisions on occupation duty in Japan. The others were the 1st Cavalry Division, 7th Infantry Division, and 25th Infantry Division, all under control of the Eighth United States Army. The 24th Division retained the 19th, 21st, and 34th regiments, but the formations were undermanned and ill-equipped due to the post-war drawdown and reduction in <b>military</b> <b>spending.</b>|$|E
