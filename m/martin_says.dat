5|$|No American {{official}} casualty {{return from}} December 5 to 8 {{is known to}} exist. Some information, however, can be pieced together from various sources. For December 5, David <b>Martin</b> <b>says</b> that General Irvine's force took about 40 casualties, while a Loyalist officer with the British Army wrote that Irvine was captured along with 23 of his men. For December 6, Howard Peckham says that the Americans lost 30 killed, 40 wounded and 15 captured. The figure of 15 prisoners taken was confirmed by John André in his journal.|$|E
5|$|For December 7, Colonel John Laurens {{stated that}} “the loss of Morgan's riflemen was 27 killed and wounded”, while John Donaldson, an American cavalryman wrote that “Morgan had 44 killed & wounded & {{among them was}} Major Morris a brave & gallant officer” This {{reference}} was to Major Joseph Morris of the 1st New Jersey Regiment, so Donaldson's figure was evidently for the whole force under Morgan's command, while Laurens' figure was for the Corps of Riflemen only. Benson Lossing confirms that “twenty-seven were killed and wounded in Morgan's Corps”, while Major Morris was badly wounded and the Maryland Militia lost “16 or 17” wounded. For December 8, David <b>Martin</b> <b>says</b> that the Maryland Militia lost 20 killed or wounded and 15 prisoners. From these sources, the aggregate American loss from December 5–8 would {{appear to have been}} 16 killed or wounded and 24 captured on the 5th; 70 killed or wounded and 15 captured on the 6th; 44 killed or wounded on the 7th and 20 killed or wounded and 15 captured on the 8th. This gives 150 killed or wounded and 54 captured, for a total loss of 204 men.|$|E
25|$|Dec 19, 2006: According to CBS News report, the Pentagon is {{planning}} to bolster its presence in the Persian Gulf {{as a warning to}} Iran's continuously defiant government. CBS News national security correspondent David <b>Martin</b> <b>says</b> the U.S. military build-up, which would include adding a second aircraft carrier to the one already in the Gulf, is being proposed as a response to what U.S. officials view as an increasingly provocative Iranian leadership.|$|E

25|$|Martin {{provides}} {{a variety of}} female characters to explore some of the ramifications of the novels being set in a patriarchal society. <b>Martin</b> <b>says</b> that he wrote all characters as human beings with the same basic needs, dreams and influences, and that his female characters are to cover the same wide spectrum of human traits like the males. Martin claims to identify with all point-of-view characters {{in the writing process}} despite significant differences to him, be it gender or age. He sees himself neither as misogynistic or a promoter of feminism, although he acknowledged that some values inoculated within childhood can never be fully abandoned, even those consciously rejected. He says that he appreciates the discussions whether the series is feminist or anti-feminist, and is very gratified of the many female readers and how much they like {{at least some of the}} female characters. He says that he does not presume to make feminist statements in either way. Martin's books frequently depict and refer to rape and humiliation, most cases of which are perpetrated upon women.|$|E
25|$|Sharon {{encourages}} Michelle to {{make amends}} with Martin and Ian, but neither of them are interested; Michelle talks to Bex, who says Michelle let herself down and the old Michelle that Bex used {{to look up to}} would hate this Michelle, and that she ruined everything she worked for; Michelle cries in Sharon's arms, saying she no longer knows herself. Ian eventually forgives Michelle but Martin still refuses to speak to her. Michelle attempts to find work in schools, without any luck. Stacey invites Michelle to a family meal but <b>Martin</b> <b>says</b> Michelle is only pretending to care about her family, and tells her that she is not the big sister he used to look up to. Michelle starts community service and hears that Tim wants a divorce, and she tries to avoid the issue. Eventually, Martin and Michelle start to talk again but he is still angry that she has behaved like a teenager. Michelle then realises that she needs to apply for other jobs so enquires about a sales assistant job, which she successfully obtains. Whilst travelling to work Michelle meets Tom Bailey (Daniel Casey) on the tube and she eventually gets the courage to ask him {{to go out on a}} date.|$|E
500|$|A {{common theme}} in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which <b>Martin</b> <b>says</b> does not mirror the real world. Just like people's {{capacity}} for good and for evil in real life, Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change. The show allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies, and thus the supposed villains can provide {{their side of the}} story. Benioff said, [...] "George brought a measure of harsh realism to high fantasy. He introduced gray tones into a black-and-white universe." ...|$|E

500|$|Part of the 2001 {{playback}} {{scene was}} included in Martin Scorsese's documentary , and an early take from the 1970 sessions appeared on the bonus disc accompanying that film's DVD release in late 2011. This demo version, which Harrison introduces as [...] "Awaiting for You All", was included on the compilation [...] (2012). Referring to Harrison's stated regret {{at the amount of}} echo Spector used on All Things Must Pass, compilation producer Giles <b>Martin</b> <b>says</b> of the song's sparse arrangement on Early Takes: [...] "I think this is really cool, it's got a good basic band groove, I think of it as George breaking down a wall of sound." ...|$|E
500|$|George <b>Martin</b> <b>says</b> Verdi was [...] "the {{greatest}} artist" [...] of the Risorgimento. [...] "Throughout {{his work}} its values, its issues recur constantly, and he expressed them with great power". [...] Franco DellaPeruta {{agrees that the}} operas and the Risorgimento are linked, emphasizing Verdi's patriotic intent and links {{to the values of}} the Risorgimento. Verdi started as a republican, became a strong supporter of Cavour, and entered the Italian parliament on Cavour's suggestion. His politics caused him to be frequently in trouble with the Austrian censors. Verdi's main works of 1842–49 were especially relevant to the struggle for independence, including 'Nabucco' (1842), 'I Lombardi alla Prima Crociata' (1843), 'Ernani' (1844), 'Attila' (1846), 'Macbeth' (1847), and 'La Battaglia di Legnano' (1848). However, starting in the 1850s, his operas showed few patriotic themes because of the heavy censorship by the absolutist regime in power. Verdi later became disillusioned by politics, but he was personally active part in the political world of events of the Risorgimento and was elected to the first Italian parliament in 1861. Likewise, Marco Pizzo argues that after 1815, music became a political tool, and many songwriters expressed ideals of freedom and equality. Pizzo claims that Verdi was part of this movement, for his operas were inspired by the love of country, the struggle for Italian independence, and speak to the sacrifice of patriots and exiles.|$|E
2500|$|Anime News Network's Carl Kimlinger {{finds the}} series [...] "shiny, attractive, and—on the whole—entertaining". But {{he adds that}} [...] "given the premise (and skill of the writers) it really should have shot for pulpy thrills instead of stately {{political}} intrigue." [...] Theron <b>Martin</b> <b>says</b> [...] "for the series as a whole to be worth watching, though, the storytelling and character development need to improve". Melissa Harper adds it is a [...] "slick, well animated show" [...] but [...] "disjointed story {{makes it difficult to}} know or care what is going on". Hypers Daniel Wilks comments that the anime is [...] "for most part rather formulaic but the series does really pick up {{when it comes to the}} action scenes which are fast, frenetic, highly creative and beautifully animated".|$|E

2500|$|The idea of who {{people are}} and what makes them who they are is a {{prominent}} theme throughout the series, becoming more prominent as the series goes on. Point of view characters change their names, even {{to a point where}} they lose their identity in the chapter title. This is best exemplified in the character of Arya, who goes through a number of identity changes as she makes her way from King's Landing to Braavos: Arry, Nymeria, Nan, Salty and Cat of the Canals, among others. (Her chapters in A Dance With Dragons see her called 'The Blind Girl' and 'The Ugly Little Girl'.) <b>Martin</b> <b>says</b> [...] "Arya has gone through a dozen different identities, even getting to Braavos — where the ultimate goal of the Faceless Men is to become no-one, {{and to be able to}} assume identities as one assumes a suit of clothes.|$|E
2500|$|Following this speech, the Illinois {{delegation}} (led by Jacob Arvey) {{announced that}} they would place Stevenson's name in nomination, and Stevenson called President Truman to ask if [...] "he would be embarrassed" [...] if Stevenson formally announced his candidacy for the nomination. Truman told Stevenson [...] "I have been trying since January {{to get you to}} say that. Why should it embarrass me?" [...] Kefauver led on the first ballot, but was well below the vote total he needed to win. Stevenson gradually gained strength until he was nominated on the third ballot. Historian John Frederick <b>Martin</b> <b>says</b> party leaders selected him because he was [...] "more moderate on civil rights than Estes Kefauver, yet nonetheless acceptable to labor and urban machines—so a coalition of southern, urban, and labor leaders fell in behind his candidacy in Chicago." [...] Stevenson's 1952 running mate was Senator John Sparkman of Alabama.|$|E
2500|$|The term supercouple first {{appeared}} in 1981, with the wedding of General Hospitals Luke and Laura. 30 million viewers tuned into the event, and the widespread media attention it received from prominent newspapers and magazines set the pairing up as the default model for other soap opera supercouples. The model Luke and Laura originally followed consisted of action stories, romance, and obstacles for the couple to overcome. This paradigm subsequently became ideal of fictional soap opera supercouples in America, and extended to other genres. In Queer TV: Framing Sexualities On US Television, Nancy <b>Martin</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "Actively desiring heterosexual pairs not bent on reproduction became a required advertising device and a narratological mainstay on daytime and primetime." [...] In Russian Television Today, David MacFadyen concludes, [...] "Even the busiest, most rambling soap operas are often neatly and conclusively distilled in the public's mind by a 'supercouple' or tiny, central pair of protagonists." [...] Luke and Laura's popularity resulted in fictional supercouples generally being regarded as soulmates. The pairings have typically overcome numerous obstacles or significant strife {{in order to be}} together.|$|E
50|$|On 24 November, US actor-comedian Will Ferrell {{was a guest}} co-host {{appearing}} in character as newsreader Ron Burgundy from the film Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues which Ferrell was visiting Australia to promote.

2500|$|Further, {{the report}} {{concluded}} regarding Martin's [...] "mental health problems, {{alcohol and drug}} use and... concerns about poor performance on the field" [...] that [...] "his text messages and other evidence demonstrate that these are real factors, not issues Incognito has manufactured out of whole cloth." [...] The report noted a published newspaper report regarding Martin's difficulties with the position change the Dolphins made with him days before he left the team and alleged harassment. The Miami Herald noted that the Dolphins were concerned about Martin's reaction to the move, and noted that [...] "It was clear Martin isn't thrilled about the move. [...] "You can approach this two different ways," [...] Martin said. [...] "You can go in the tank and be {{one of those guys who}} bitches and moans and is a cancer in the locker room, or you can be a guy who goes out there and can be a professional and plays as hard as I can."

2500|$|This sonnet is {{important}} because it is the first one that Shakespeare gives us. It sets the tone {{for the rest of the}} collection of sonnets. According to Helen Vendler, this sonnet can be “as an index to the rest of the sonnets". The main reason she says that it {{is important}} is because it brings [...] "into play such a plethora of conceptual material; it seems a self-conscious groundwork laid for the rest". Scholars like Helen Vendler think that this particular sonnet may have been composed after the others. She says that because of the [...] "sheer abundance of values, images, and concepts important in the sequence which are called into play" [...] and [...] "the number of significant words brought to our attention" [...] in this sonnet, that it [...] "may have been deliberately composed late, as a 'preface' to the others". Philip <b>Martin</b> <b>says</b> that Sonnet 1 is important to the rest because it [...] "states the themes for the sonnets immediately following and also for the sequence at large". To him, the themes are announced in this sonnet and the later ones develop those themes. Joseph Pequigney says that Sonnet 1 does serve an introductory and does it unconventionally; [...] "it might on that very account be seen as a befitting way to begin the least conventional of Renaissance love-sonnet sequences". It provides a [...] "production of metaphorical motifs that will recur in the upcoming sonnets, particularly in the next fourteen or so; it gives the concepts of beauty and time and their interrelationship, as also the emblem of the rose, all of which carry the weight in the other sonnets; and it shows the theme of reproduction, to be taken up in all except one of the sixteen ensuing poems".|$|E
