40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on a study of the {{behaviour}} of the <b>multiple</b> <b>burner</b> systems. The influence of number of burners, their separation and degree of swirl on the interaction of multiple gaseous turbulent diffusion flames, for different configurations chosen, has been investigated. A single flame has been studied as a reference flame to provide information for the comparison with multiple systems. The temperature and concentration profiles within the flames have been determined using thermocouples and a semi-continuous gas sampling system in conjunction with a gas chromatograph. Three orthoganol mean velocity components in the annular air stream of a single isothermal swirling jet have been measured using a hot wire anemometer and by the application of a four point measurement technique developed within the department. Multiple flame systems were found to be less stable against blow-off compared to single flames and the blow-off limit shifted towards the fuel rich region as the swirl was reduced. At low swirl levels and minimum separation the centre flames were lifted off the burner rim and were frequently blown-off. ...|$|R

This work will be performed to provide necessary design and operational information for inclusion of an optimized NO, control subsystem in the Proof-of-Concept Test Facility (POCTF) and Commercial Generating Unit (CGU) designs. The BSF is a 50 to 90 x 10 {sup 6 } BTU/hr (15 to 26 MWt) coal, oil or natural gas fired tangential furnace designed to replicate the residence time/temperature history of a utility scale tangentially fired boiler. All major aspects of a typical utility boiler are duplicated in the BSF including the lower furnace, the ash hopper, <b>multiple</b> <b>burner</b> elevations, the arch section, superheater/reheater panels, and the convective heat transfer surfaces. The furnace walls and heat transfer surfaces are cooled by a surrounding water jacket. Steam generated is vented off at atmospheric pressure so that a constant sink temperature of 100 {degrees}C (212 {degrees}C) is maintained. The lower furnace water walls are selectively refractory lined to maintain an appropriate furnace gas temperature history. Refractory is required because the sink temperature (100 {degrees}C) is cooler {{than that of a}} typical, utility boiler, and the surface-to-volume ratio of the BSF is greater than that of a utility boiler due to scale effects. For the subject testing, the BSF will be configured as a coal fired boiler. Design and planning activities associated with the construction of the NO{sub x} control subsystem test unit will continue through June, 1995. Additionally, the schedule for specification of certain low NO{sub x} firing system components was set to allow for precursor, internal and LEBS development activities to occur and subsequently provide necessary design parameters...|$|R
40|$|Fossil {{fuel fired}} utility boilers fire {{a range of}} fuels under {{variable}} operation conditions. This variability in fuel diet and load conditions is linked to various problems in boiler performances, particularly the flame quality which is closely associated with furnace safety, combustion efficiency and pollutant emissions. Reliable flame monitoring is thus critical as the flame can fluctuate significantly in terms of size, shape, location, colour and temperature distribution. For instance, heat recovery water tube boilers are commonly used in industry to recover the energy in the exhaust gas from gas turbines. The boiler is fitted with <b>multiple</b> <b>burners</b> which allow flexibility with tuning of the boiler firing rates depending on process steam demand. It was reported that flame properties in such boilers had {{a direct impact on}} the flame stability and pollutant emissions (i. e., NOx and CO). There is, however, no technique available for online monitoring and quantifying the flame properties of individual burners. This has resulted in a lack of understanding in how each burner operates with regard to the overall performance of the boiler, particularly the emissions. Under the support of the BF 2 RA and EPSRC, an imaging and spectrometry based instrumentation system is being developed for flame monitoring and emission. Fig 1 shows the block diagram of the system. An optical probe, protected by the air-cooled jacket, transmits the light of flame to the camera house. The light of flame is then split into two beams. The first beam is captured by a camera to provide images for determining the physical parameters of the flame. The second beam is received by a miniature spectrometer for flame spectral analysis. Intelligent computing algorithms are developed for flame monitoring and emission prediction. The system, once fully developed, will be assessed under a range of operation conditions on a heat recovery water tube boiler at a British Sugar’s factory. More test results will be presented at the conference...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Cooktop burners {{are widely}} used nowadays. In cooktop burner design, nozzle {{efficiency}} and greenhouse gas(GHG) emissions mainly depend on heat transfer from the premixed flame to the impinging surface. This is a complicated issue depending on the individual and combined effects of various input combustion variables. Optimal operating conditions for sustainable burner design were rarely addressed, {{especially in the case}} of <b>multiple</b> slot-jet <b>burners.</b> Through evaluating the optimal combination of combustion conditions for a premixed slot-jet array, this paper develops a practical approach for the sustainable design of gas cooktop burners. Efficiency, CO and NOx emissions in respect of an array of slot jets using premixed flames were analysed. Response surface experimental design were applied to three controllable factors of the combustion process, viz. Reynolds number, equivalence ratio and jet-to-vessel distance.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this program is to {{provide insight into the}} {{formation}} and minimization of NO{sub x} in multi-burner arrays, such as those that would be found in a typical utility boiler. Most detailed studies are performed in single-burner test facilities, and may not capture significant burner-to-burner interactions that could influence NO{sub x} emissions. Thus, investigations of such interactions were made by performing a combination of single and <b>multiple</b> <b>burner</b> experiments in a pilot-scale coal-fired test facility at the University of Utah, and by the use of computational combustion simulations to evaluate full-scale utility boilers. In addition, fundamental studies on nitrogen release from coal were performed to develop greater understanding of the physical processes that control NO formation in pulverized coal flames [...] particularly under low NO{sub x} conditions. A CO/H{sub 2 }/O{sub 2 }/N{sub 2 } flame was operated under fuel-rich conditions in a flat flame reactor to provide a high temperature, oxygen-free post-flame environment to study secondary reactions of coal volatiles. Effects of temperature, residence time and coal rank on nitrogen evolution and soot formation were examined. Elemental compositions of the char, tar and soot were determined by elemental analysis, gas species distributions were determined using FTIR, and the chemical structure of the tar and soot was analyzed by solid-state {sup 13 }C NMR spectroscopy. A laminar flow drop tube furnace was used to study char nitrogen conversion to NO. The experimental evidence and simulation results indicated that some of the nitrogen present in the char is converted to nitric oxide after direct attack of oxygen on the particle, while another portion of the nitrogen, present in more labile functionalities, is released as HCN and further reacts in the bulk gas. The reaction of HCN with NO in the bulk gas has a strong influence on the overall conversion of char-nitrogen to nitric oxide; therefore, any model that aims to predict the conversion of char-nitrogen to nitric oxide should allow for the conversion of char-nitrogen to HCN. The extent of the HCN conversion to NO or N{sub 2 } will depend on the composition of the atmosphere surrounding the particle. A pilot-scale testing campaign was carried out to evaluate the impact of multiburner firing on NO{sub x} emissions using a three-burner vertical array. In general, the results indicated that multiburner firing yielded higher NO{sub x} emissions than single burner firing at the same fuel rate and excess air. Mismatched burner operation, due to increases in the firing rate of the middle burner, generally demonstrated an increase in NO{sub x} over uniform firing. Biased firing, operating the middle burner fuel rich with the upper and lower burners fuel lean, demonstrated an overall reduction in NO{sub x} emissions; particularly when the middle burner was operated highly fuel rich. Computational modeling indicated that operating the three burner array with the center burner swirl in a direction opposite to the other two resulted in a slight reduction in NO{sub x}...|$|R
40|$|LectureGrowing global energy {{demands are}} {{motivating}} the gas turbine industry to seek fuel-flexible gas turbines capable of burning {{a wide variety}} of fuels as a means of increasing energy supply stability and security. These fuel-flexible gas turbines require diluent-free (?dry?), low nitrogen oxide (NOx) and flashback-resistant combustors for various fuels in order to achieve low NOx emissions and high plant efficiency for low carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. This paper describes the development of a state-of-the-art dry low-NOx and flashback-resistant combustor for fuel-flexible gas turbines. This advanced combustor consists of multiple fuel nozzles and multiple air holes. One fuel nozzle and one air hole are installed coaxially to give one key element, and a cluster of key elements constitutes one burner, which forms one flame. <b>Multiple</b> cluster <b>burners</b> constitute a can combustor, and several can combustors are installed on a gas turbine. In this paper, the burner is called a ?cluster burner,? and the combustor is called a ?multi-cluster combustor. ? The essence of the burner concept is the integration of two key technologies: low-NOx combustion due to the enhancement of fuel-air mixing; and flashback-resistant combustion due to short premixing sections, air-stream-surrounded fuel jets and lifted flames. The development approach of the multi-cluster combustor consists of three steps: burner development; combustor development; and feasibility demonstration for practical plants. The first step optimizes burner configurations by fundamental research at atmospheric pressure. The second step optimizes combustor configurations by single-can combustor testing at medium to high pressures. The third step demonstrates the feasibility of the combustor by field testing with real gas turbines. This paper describes the development work in each step of the multi-cluster combustor developed particularly for hydrogen content syngas fuels in a coal-based integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), and the field test in an IGCC pilot plant demonstrates the feasibility of the combustor for practical plants. This paper also describes applications of this combustion technology to expand fuel flexibility...|$|R

H 20 concentration was determined from the measured peak absorbance of one transition set at the measured temperature. The temperatures recorded using the sensor compared well with those measured by thermocouples. A computer-controlled closed-loop feedback circuit that actuated the fuel flow in response to the difference between the measured and desired gas temperature was used to control the flame temperature in the probed region.

40|$|Two {{mathematical}} {{models have}} been developed to simulate two-dimensional, premixed, laminar, stationary, axisymmetric methane-air flames, and successfully validated with non-intrusive Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS) temperature measurements. With the first model, the heat releaser ate model, volumetric heat release rate was generalised from one-dimensional computations. This approximation greatly simplified the set of governing equations that need to be solved. However, it cannot describe the effects of high stretch rates or of negative stretch rate. The second model made use of a number of reduced chemical kinetic schemes, with realistic elementary reactions. These were drawn from the literature and realistic transport properties have been included. With this model, {{based on the work of}} Peters (1985), the effects of stretch are automatically accounted for. Practical experimental validation was obtained with a <b>multiple</b> slot <b>burner,</b> supplied by the collaborating body, British Gas p 1 c. Temperature fields, obtained with the CARS technique, partially validated the reduced chemical kinetic scheme model. Some uncertainty arose in the prediction of heat loss to the burner tube. A numerical algorithm based upon the SUVIPLE method was employed,with a fully staggered grid. Various discretisation schemes were examined with the heat release model. Based on these tests, the hybrid scheme was selected for use in the reduced model. With this approach, a few reduced kinetic schemes have been selected and implemented. The most successfuol ne was the Peters(1985) scheme. This consisted of 4 global reaction steps with 18 elementary reactions and 7 non-steady chemical species. The scheme has been employed in all the detailed computations in the present study. With this scheme, two-dimensional field solutions, for methane-air mixtures with equivalence ratios of 0. 75, 0. 84 and 1. 0, with slot widths of 2 mm, and 3 mm, and mean inlet velocities ranging from 0. 3 m/s to 2. 8 m/s have been obtained.

These includes flame height, flame thickness, and heat loss to the burner tube. The loss can range between 3...|$|R
40|$|An initial testing {{campaign}} {{was carried out}} {{during the summer of}} 2000 to evaluate the impact of multiburner firing on NOx emissions. Extensive data had been collected during the Fall of 1999 and Spring of 2000 using a single pulverized-coal (PC) burner, and this data collection was funded by a separate Department of Energy program, the Combustion 2000 Low Emission Boiler System (LEBS) project under the direction of DB Riley. This single-burner data was thus available for comparison with NOx emissions obtained while firing three burners at the same overall load and operating conditions. A range of operating conditions were explored that were compatible with single-burner data, and thus the emission trends as a function of air staging, burner swirl and other parameters will be described below. In addition, a number of burner-to-burner operational variations were explored that provided interesing insight on their potential impact on NOx emissions. Some of these variations include: running one burner very fuel rich while running the others fuel lean; varying the swirl of a single burner while holding others constant; increasing the firing rate of a single burner while decreasing the others. In general, the results to date indicated that multiburner firing yielded higher NOx emissions than single burner firing at the same fuel rate and excess air. At very fuel rich burner stoichiometries (SR < 0. 75), the difference between <b>multiple</b> and single <b>burners</b> became indistinguishable.

40|$|Hydrocarbon {{reforming}} {{involves a}} variety of chemical reactions at high temperatures and pressures {{in the presence of}} suitable catalysts. The conversion of naptha to high octane aromatics requires high energy to initiate and sustain the reaction at temperatures of 850 - 950 oF. Hydrogen - rich off - gases are fired in combinations of process furnaces. Heat is transferred to hydrocarbon fluids by radiation, principally. Feed or return stream temperatures determine the need for convection sections. It is essential that the operation and maintenance of these furnaces be optimized to minimize production costs. This paper describes the performance testing and evaluation of a set of ten refinery furnaces used to thermally drive several reforming reactors and to regenerate catalysts. Firing rates provide an input of 216. 2 x 106 Btu/hr. to the furnaces, at $ 1. 90 per 106 Btu.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} three {{different}} combustion systems, equipped {{with either a}} single or <b>multiple</b> ?ameless combustion <b>burner(s),</b> are discussed. All these setups were investigated both experimentally and numerically, i. e., using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Flameless combustion is a combustion technology capable of accomplishing the combination of high energy ef?ciency (by preheating of the combustion air) and low emissions, especially nitrogen oxides (NOx). These high combustion air preheat temperatures normally account for increased thermal formation of NOx, however, in ?ameless combustion, by delayed mixing of the fuel and oxidizer and high internal ?ue gas recirculation, the rates of these reactions are decreased. Nitrogen oxide {{plays a key role}} in acid rain formation and the generation of photochemical smog. The ?rst setup that has been investigated is a furnace equipped with two regenerative ?ameless combustion burner pairs, with a thermal power of 100 kWth each, located at the laboratories of Kungliga Tekniska H¨ gskolan (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden (Chapter 4). The objective of this study is to investigate the performance of the furnace operating in two different ?ring modes, parallel and staggered. The furnace performance is de?ned as the energy ef?ciency and the NO emissions. Experimental results show that for parallel ?ring mode both the ef?ciency was higher and the NO emissions were lower compared to staggered ?ring mode. With the use of the CFD simulations, it was shown that in parallel mode the radiative heat transfer was higher due to formation of a larger zone with gases with improved radiative properties and that higher velocities along the cooling tubes, due to lower momentum destruction, led to higher convective heat transfer. Both of these heat transfer methods contributed to the higher energy ef?ciency in parallel ?ring mode. Additionally, the lower formation of NO emissions in parallel ?ring mode was due to the fact that the low-momentum fuel jets merged slower with the high-momentum combustion air jets, resulting in more internal ?ue gas recirculation and a less intense combustion zone. Moreover, it was found that NOx was formed via the thermal and N 2 O intermediate pathways. No prompt NO was formed, while the reburning pathway resulted in a reduction of the total NO emissions. The second setup is a 300 kWth furnace equipped with three pairs of regenerative ?ameless combustion burners, located at Delft University of Technology (DUT) in the Netherlands (Chapter 5). An experimental parametric study was performed, varying the positions of the burners in the furnace (the burner con?guration), the ?ring mode (parallel and staggered), the excess air ratio and the cycle time, with the objective to optimize the furnace performance. Since similar trends in the furnace performance, as for the furnace at KTH, comparing parallel and staggered ?ring mode, were observed, staggered mode was exempted from further analysis. Additionally, one of the ?ve investigated burner con?gurations has also been exempted due to a signi?cant lower energy ef?ciency compared to the other con?gurations. The experimental results show that the burner positioning and the cycle time had a signi?cant in?uence on the temperature inside the regenerators, and thus on the preheat temperature of the combustion air. This temperature turned out to be important regarding the CO emissions. Furthermore, it was found that comparing different cases ?ring in ?ameless mode, an improved temperature uniformity in the furnace was not re?ected by a higher energy ef?ciency. Finally, a horizontal setup of the ?ring burners (the three ?ring burners positioned in a horizontal row) improved the energy ef?ciency at similar temperature uniformities. Steady CFD simulations have been performed for this furnace for four different burner con?gurations ?ring in parallel mode (Chapter 6). During the careful selection of the set of physical models to be used, it was found that, due to relatively low Reynolds numbers in the cooling air ?ow in the annulus of the cooling tubes, predictions of the heat extraction rates of these cooling tubes were improved by treating the ?ow in the cooling tubes as laminar. Furthermore, the applied error tolerance of the ISAT procedure was insuf?cient for accurate species concentration predictions, however, based on analysis of the main species concentrations in the ?ue gas, this inaccuracy did not in?uence the overall predictions. It was possible to explain the most important results of the experimental study using the CFD simulations. In the ?rst place, it was found that a recirculation zone between the upper ?ring burners and the stack in two con?gurations resulted in a smaller fraction of the ?ue gases leaving the furnace via the stack compared to the other two con?gurations. Thus, a larger fraction of the ?ue gas left the furnace via the regenerating burners, which resulted in higher preheat temperatures of the combustion air. Secondly, the experimentally observed differences in the temperature uniformity between the four con?gurations could be explained by the presence of less or more pronounced recirculation zones, the latter leading to higher temperature uniformities in the furnace. Finally, it was con?rmed that the jets of the burners showed similar merging behaviour for different burner con?gurations, leading to similar NO emissions, a trend that was also observed in the experiments. The third setup is a prototype ?ameless combustion gas turbine combustor (Chapter 7). The combustor was ?red with various Low Calori?c Value (LCV) gases. The in?uence of several parameters (the fuel composition, the outlet temperature and the inlet nozzle diameter) on the CO and NO emissions has been investigated. In the ?rst place, it was shown that this prototype ?ameless combustion gas turbine combustor could be operated in ?ameless mode ?ring the LCV gases. Moreover, for both pollutants ultra-low emissions (single-digit) have been achieved. In the CFD simulations, different turbulence models and chemistry mechanisms have been compared, leading to a set with models which gave the best results. Comparing the measured and predicted axial temperature pro?les in the combustor, it was concluded that the observed discrepancies were within the range of uncertainty in what are optimal values of the model constants. From NO calculations, ultra-low emission combustion was con?rmed. Also, it was found that 90 % of the NO was formed via the N 2 O path, and the remaining 10 % via the thermal pathway. No prompt NO was formed, a trend also observed for the KTH furnace. In conclusion, important knowledge on the behaviour of furnaces equipped with <b>multiple</b> ?ameless combustion <b>burners</b> has been attained. Especially, the in?uence on the furnace performance of the ?ring con?guration of the burners and the burner positioning in the furnace will contribute to more successful (industrial) application of this combustion technology in the future. Recommendations for the installation of ?ameless combustion burners in large industrial-scale furnaces have been proposed. Finally, the shown possibility of ?ring a (prototype) gas turbine combustor with low calori?c value gases in ?ameless mode, enables the utilization of biomass derived gaseous fuels in existing equipment.
