There are a total of 2,875 street lamps in the town: 276 sodium lamps, five <b>mercury</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>lamps,</b> 2,592 tube lights and two high-mast beam lamps. The municipality operates three markets, namely, the Municipal Market, Uzhavar Santhai, and Virudhunagar Bazaar Market, that cater {{to the needs of the}} town and the surrounding rural areas.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} porphyrins with varying side chains was {{synthesized}} and {{tested in the}} rat for hard and soft tissue binding and photosensitization. It was found that for combination with either type of tissue there was a requirement for groups capable of ionic or hydrogen bonding at more than one edge of the tetrapyrrole nucleus. Thus binding to keratin, collagen and growing bone occurred with purified haematopophyrin, commercial “haematoporphyrin” and haematoporphyrin “derivative”. Little or no binding with these tissues occurred with deuteroporphyrin, deuteroporphyrin dimethyl ester disulphonic acid, haematoporphyrin dimethylether and unexpectedly, porphyrin c and N,N′-diacetyl porphyrin c. Incorporation of iron into the last two named is thought to account for their apparent lack of binding. In the case of growing bone, the same pattern was apparent with the exception that porphyrin c and N,N′-diacetyl porphyrin c were very strong labels. Combination to bone was with the organic rather than with the inorganic component. All soluble porphyrins tested induced a potential photosensitivity on intraperitoneal injection. Using intravenous colloidal carbon {{as an indicator of}} an increase in vascular permeability, the photoresponse following excitation with sunlight, <b>mercury</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>lamp</b> or carbon arc was found to be biphasic, with the delayed response altered by dosage and binding ability of porphyrins, and the amount of light absorbed...|$|R
40|$|Exposure of a Chardonnay wine {{to light}} from a <b>mercury</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>lamp</b> under {{controlled}} temperature conditions showed that colour enhancement was dependent on bottle colour. The increase in colouration was Antique Green < French Green < Arctic Blue < Flint, {{in agreement with the}} transmission characteristics of each bottle type. Xanthylium pigments were identified as one component contributing to the observed enhancement of colour. The presence of oxygen was shown to be a critical factor to initiate the formation of these xanthylium pigments during light exposure. Without temperature control, wine colour development was highest in Antique Green and lowest in Flint. This alternate order reflects the ability of the darker bottles to retain heat longer than lighter coloured ones as confirmed by surface temperature decay rates. Specific pigments contributing to the wine colour enhancement in uncontrolled temperature/light exposure experiments could not be identified, although tentative evidence was obtained for the presence of flavan- 3 -ol based compounds. The different bottle glass surfaces did not influence the rate of loss of dissolved oxygen or oxidation of ascorbic acid. The potential to develop the results obtained in this study to identify markers for light and/or temperature exposure of white wines is discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|The entire rock {{surface is}} {{of a very}} dark (almost black) colour and {{effectively}} absorbs sunlight, thus creating a warm surface on which to rest. The water runs under the dark rock slabs and is thus heated by them, so that the fountain water is solar heated. Three curved lighting masts along the south edge of the square, made of hollow structural steel, have a high-gloss white finish that contrasts with the rough non-slip texture of the black granite, and each support six <b>mercury</b> <b>vapour</b> arc <b>lamps</b> that create evening light that comes from approximately the same directions as natural sunlight does during the day (i.e., from various southerly directions).|$|R
