Wilcutt and Altman commanded a series of four altitude boosts to place the station in an orbit of approximately 241 by 233 statute miles, raising the average altitude by 14 mi. After spending 7 days, 21 hours and 54 minutes linked to the station, Atlantis undocked at 11:46 pm EDT as Wilcutt and Altman fired Atlantis' jets to <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> of about 450 feet for a double-loop flyaround.|$|E
50|$|While {{shooting}} {{on a nearby}} beach, Nandini discovers a Thali, and after the discovery, mysterious events start taking place. So, Nandini decides to visit a priest. The priest discovers that the Thali is actually haunted, lets Nandini {{out of his room}} and returns the Thali to the spirit. But Nandini doesn't seem to believe it and the priest challenges her to check the place where she had taken it from. After Nandini and Pooja disturb the Thali for a second time, it doesn't leave them. She rushes to the priest and he helps her. As instructed by him, she prepares a coffin and a groomed woman's corpse which has the Thali. They <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> and shoot to see that the coffin literally breaks open and the dead woman is dragged by the ghost. All the members run away out of fear and Raghava collapses. The priest who helps Nandini is also killed by the ghost. Nandini tries to wake Raghava up but is too late as she gets possessed by the ghost of Ganga.|$|E
40|$|Relatam-se os resultados de coletas de flebotomíneos em área com elevado grau de antropia, no Município de São Jorge do Ivaí, Estado do Paraná, Brasil. A espécie predominante foi Lutzomyia (Nyssomyia) {{intermedia}} (Lutz & Neiva, 1912). Verificou-se que o número de flebotomíneos diminuiu sensivelmente em duas residências com o deslocamento de uma pocilga, à distância de 100 metros das residências, e a desobstrução do porão de uma das residências. Information on phlebotomine {{collections in}} an area {{with a high level}} of human interference, in S. Jorge do Ivaí county, Paraná State, Southern Brazil, is reported. Lutzomyia (Nyssomyia) intermedia (Lutz & Neiva, 1912) was the dominant species. The number of sandflies in domiciles decreased sharply in the second period of collection.

60|$|Arrived at the camp, {{which had}} been <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> {{of four or five}} miles from El Molino, I found Santa Coloma just ready to mount his horse <b>to</b> start on <b>an</b> {{expedition}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> small town eight or nine leagues distant. He at once asked me to go with him, and remarked that he was very much pleased, though not surprised, at my having changed my mind about joining him. We did not return till late in the evening, and the whole of the following day was spent in monotonous cavalry exercises. I then went to the General and requested permission to visit the Casa Blanca to bid adieu to my friends there. He informed me that he intended going to El Molino the next morning himself and would take me with him. The first thing he did on our arrival at the village was to send me to the principal storekeeper in the place, a man who had faith in the Blanco leader, and was rapidly disposing of a large stock of goods at a splendid profit, receiving in payment sundry slips of paper signed by Santa Coloma. This good fellow, who mixed politics with business, provided me with a complete and much-needed outfit, which included a broadcloth suit of clothes, soft brown hat rather broad in the brim, long riding-boots, and poncho. Going back to the official building or headquarters in the plaza, I received my sword, which did not harmonise very well with the civilian costume I wore; but I was no worse off in this respect than forty-nine out of every fifty men in our little army.|$|R

There would have been hardly any limit to the allowance made to him, and he would have gone forth armed with introductions, which would have made every port <b>a</b> happy home <b>to</b> him. But as soon as the tour was suggested he resolved at once that he could not <b>move</b> himself <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> from Ayala.

25|$|All seems lost until Independences Armadillo arrives. With A.J. at the controls, {{they reach}} the {{required}} depth for the bomb. However, flying debris from the asteroid damages the triggering device, requiring someone to stay behind to manually detonate the bomb. The crew draw straws and A.J. is selected.
