6000|$|Oh, my friends, look to Him, {{the author}} and perfecter of all faith, all trust, all loyal daring {{for the sake of}} duty and of God! Look at His {{patience}}. See how He endured the cross, despising the shame. See how He endured--how patience had her perfect work in Him--how in all things He was more than conqueror. What gentleness, what calmness, what silence, what infinite depths of Divine love within Him! A heart which neither shame, nor torture, nor insult, could stir from its Godlike resolution. When looking down from that cross He beheld none almost but enemies, heard no word but mockery; when those who passed by reviled Him, wagging their heads and saying, [...] "He saved others, Himself He cannot save;" [...] His only answer was a prayer for forgiveness for that besotted mob who were yelling beneath Him like hounds about their game. Consider Him, and then consider ourselves, ruffled and put out of temper by the slightest cross accident, the slightest harsh word, too often by the slightest pain-- not to mention insults, for we pride ourselves in not bearing them. Try, my friends, if you can, even in the dimmest way, fancy yourselves for one instant in His place this day 1815 years. Fancy yourselves hanging on that cross--fancy that mocking mob below-- fancy--but I dare not go on with the picture. Only think--think what would have been YOUR temper there, and then you may get some slight notion of the boundless love and the boundless endurance of the Saviour whom WE love so little, for whose sake <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>will</b> not endure the trouble of giving up a single sin.|$|E
60|$|<b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>will</b> be canvassed soon, I suppose; {{some of us}} {{may even}} canvass. Upon which side, of course, nothing will induce me to state, beyond saying that by a {{remarkable}} coincidence it will in every case be the only side in which a high-minded, public-spirited, and patriotic citizen can take even a momentary interest. But the general question of canvassing itself, being a non-party question, is one which we may be permitted to approach. The rules for canvassers are fairly familiar to any one who has ever canvassed. They are printed on the little card which you carry about with you and lose. There is a statement, I think, that you must not offer a voter food or drink. However hospitable you may feel towards him in his own house, you must not carry his lunch about with you. You must not produce a veal cutlet from your tail-coat pocket. You must not conceal poached eggs about your person. You must not, {{like a kind of}} conjurer, produce baked potatoes from your hat. In short, the canvasser must not feed the voter in any way. Whether the voter is allowed to feed the canvasser, whether the voter may give the canvasser veal cutlets and baked potatoes, is a point of law on which I {{have never been able to}} inform myself. When I found myself canvassing a gentleman, I have sometimes felt tempted to ask him if there was any rule against his giving me food and drink; but the matter seemed a delicate one to approach. His attitude to me also sometimes suggested a doubt as to whether he would, even if he could. But there are voters who might find it worth while to discover if there is any law against bribing a canvasser. They might bribe him to go away.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of several historical trends in psychology and provides an evaluation and critique from a Biblical perspective. I will primarily focus on three psychological theories of personality that have especially influenced clinical practice and, more significantly, cultural beliefs and values.

This question had been answered in a variety of ways, but one can't help but wonder, as one learns more and more about the detailed mechanism by which living organisms store energy and use it, how they got started in the first place. Actually, these thoughts began long before we heard of Sputnik and all of its successors. However, the fact is that it is now becoming possible for us to know, perhaps within five years, whether there are organic chemicals on the Moon and what the genetic nature of the living material on Mars might be.
