These days most of the encryption algorithms based on the idea of (Public- Private Key), so that the process of encryption uses a key known to everyone and the decryption process uses a different private key, such as the RSA. The problem in these algorithms is the giving of the same cipher-text each time you encrypt a particular text using a specific key, which makes it easier to discover the original text by relating the encrypted text to a well-known decrypted text. The main purpose of this research is to build a reliable, an efficient, and a more secure algorithm for encryption. This algorithm gives <b>multiple</b> <b>ciphers</b> for a specific message using the same key and produces the original message once we decrypt these ciphers; this will make the process of hacking by relating the cipher to the text so difficult.

The Zodiac was a serial killer who killed a number of people in and around the San Francisco Bay area during the 1960 s. He is confirmed to have seven victims, two of whom survived [1], although in taunting letters to the news media he claims to have killed 37 people.

Current VPN technologies based on embedded systems with software-only algorithm implementations are difficult to scale to the network speeds and algorithmic complexity required. A solution to this problem will be proposed in this research project using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based reconfigurable Systemon- Chip (rSoC) technology A 3 DES-CBC core with key generator that achieves more than 100 Mbit/s of encryption or decryption while occupying about 608 slices in a Xilinx FPGA is presented. This will allow the 3 DES core to be implemented in much smaller FPGAs or put together with other cores to form the rSoC on the same chip. Coupling the flexibility of the rSoC and hardware cipher cores can be an effective solution to the current real world requirement for a flexible and affordable VPN platform. The accessible performance of hardware cryptographic accelerator cores after integration to a reconfigurable System-on-Chip is a relatively unexplored area. There is also little work done on a stream aware cipher core for reconfigurable systems. This thesis presents a novel architecture, the Multi Stream Cipher Architecture (MSCA), which allows a cipher core to operate on <b>multiple</b> <b>cipher</b> streams without software context switching.

In this paper, we tackle this problem for the case of block ciphers based on ideal components such as random permutations and random functions as well as propose new generic known-key attacks on generalized Feistel ciphers. We introduce the notion of known-key indifferentiability to capture the security of such block ciphers under a known key. To show its meaningfulness, we prove that the known-key attacks on block ciphers with ideal primitives to date violate security under known-key indifferentiability. On the other hand, to demonstrate its constructiveness, we prove the balanced Feistel cipher with random functions and the <b>multiple</b> Even-Mansour <b>cipher</b> with ran-dom permutations known-key indifferentiable for a sufficient number of rounds.

Our proposed combined attack strategy works well even if the useful ciphertexts are not available to the adversary. Further, the power trace classifications of a Grain cipher implementation on SASEBO G-II standard side channel evaluation board is shown in order to validate our proposed attack against the cipher. The captured power traces were analyzed using Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) learning algorithm based multiclass classifiers to classify the power traces into the respective Hamming distance (HD) classes.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} several new attacks on <b>multiple</b> {{encryption}} block <b>ciphers</b> {{based on the}} meet-in-the-middle attack. In the first attack (GDD-MTM), we guess {{a certain number of}} secret key bits and apply the meet-in-the-middle attack on multiple ciphertexts. The second attack (TMTO-MTM) is derived from applying the time-memory trade-off attack to the meet-in-the-middle attack on a single ciphertext. We may also use rainbow chains in the table construction to get the Rainbow-MTM attack. The fourth attack (BS-MTM) is defined by combining the time-memory-data trade-off attack proposed by Biryukov and Shamir to the meet-in-the-middle attack on multiple ciphertexts. Lastly, for the final attack (TMD-MTM), we apply the TMTO-Data curve, which demonstrates the general methodology for multiple data trade-offs, to the meet-in-the-middle attack. GDD-MTM requires no pre-processing, but the attack complexity is high while memory requirement is low. In the last four attacks, pre-processing is required but we can achieve lower (faster) online attack complexity at the expense of more memory in comparison with the GDD-MTM attack. To illustrate how the attacks may be used, we applied them in the cryptanalysis of triple DES. In particular, for the BS-MTM attack, we managed to achieve pre-computation and data complexity which are much lower while maintaining almost the same memory and online attack complexity, as compared to a timememory-data trade-off attack by Biryukov et al. at SAC 2005. In all, our new methodologies offer viable alternatives and provide more flexibility in achieving time-memory-data trade-offs...|$|R
