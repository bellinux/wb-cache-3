50|$|Because of {{the dangers}} of grain {{boundaries}} in certain materials such as superalloy turbine blades, great technological leaps were made to minimize as much as possible the effect of grain boundaries in the blades. The result was directional solidification processing in which grain boundaries were eliminated by producing columnar grain structures aligned parallel to the axis of the blade, since this is usually the direction of <b>maximum</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> felt by a blade during its rotation in an airplane. The resulting turbine blades consisted of a single grain, improving reliability.|$|E
50|$|If {{a column}} is {{circular}} (or nearly so) {{an increase in}} axial capacity is also achieved by wrapping. In this application, the confinement of the CFRP wrap enhances the compressive strength of the concrete. However, although large increases are achieved in the ultimate collapse load, the concrete will crack at only slightly enhanced load, meaning that this application is only occasionally used. Specialist ultra-high modulus CFRP (with tensile modulus of 420 GPa or more) {{is one of the}} few practical methods of strengthening cast-iron beams. In typical use, it is bonded to the tensile flange of the section, both increasing the stiffness of the section and lowering the neutral axis, thus greatly reducing the <b>maximum</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> in the cast iron.|$|E
50|$|When {{an object}} formed {{of a single}} material, like a wooden beam or a steel rod, is bent (Fig. 1), it {{experiences}} a range of stresses across its depth (Fig. 2). At {{the edge of the}} object {{on the inside of the}} bend (concave face) the stress will be at its maximum compressive stress value. At the outside of the bend (convex face) the stress will be at its maximum tensile value. These inner and outer edges of the beam or rod are known as the 'extreme fibers'. Most materials fail under tensile stress before they fail under compressive stress, so the <b>maximum</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> value that can be sustained before the beam or rod fails is its flexural strength.|$|E

50|$|Both the {{bending moment}} and the shear force cause {{stresses}} in the beam. The stress due to shear force is maximum along the neutral {{axis of the}} beam (when {{the width of the}} beam, t, is constant along the cross section of the beam; otherwise an integral involving the first moment and the beam's width needs to be evaluated for the particular cross section), and the <b>maximum</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> is at either the top or bottom surfaces. Thus the maximum principal stress in the beam may be neither at the surface nor at the center but in some general area. However, shear force stresses are negligible in comparison to bending moment stresses in all but the stockiest of beams as well as the fact that stress concentrations commonly occur at surfaces, meaning that the maximum stress in a beam is likely to be at the surface.|$|E
5000|$|Compressive and {{tensile forces}} {{develop in the}} {{direction}} of the beam axis under bending loads. These forces induce stresses on the beam. The maximum compressive stress is found at the uppermost edge of the beam while the <b>maximum</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> is located at the lower edge of the beam. Since the stresses between these two opposing [...] vary linearly, there therefore exists a point on the linear path between them where there is no bending stress. The locus of these points is the neutral axis. Because of this area with no stress and the adjacent areas with low stress, using uniform cross section beams in bending is not a particularly efficient means of supporting a load as it does not use the full capacity of the beam until it is on the brink of collapse. Wide-flange beams (-beams) and truss girders effectively address this inefficiency as they minimize the amount of material in this under-stressed region.|$|E

The stress is evaluated by using measured modulus of elasticity and strain. Different types of tests are performed, in which specimens are exposed to artificial climate change when the specimens are in either a wetting or a drying state, and specimens are exposed to a cyclic climate change.

40|$|We analyze {{plane strain}} {{thermomechanical}} deformations of a prenotched rectangular plate impacted {{on one side}} by a prismatic body of rectangular cross-section and moving parallel to axis of the notch. Both the plate and the projectile are made of the same material. Strain hardening, strain-rate hardening and thermal softening characteristics of the material are modeled by the Johnson-Cook relation. The effect of different material parameters, notch-tip radius, impact speed {{and the length of}} the projectile on the <b>maximum</b> <b>tensile</b> principal <b>stress</b> and the initiation and propagation of shear bands at the notch-tip is analyzed. It is found that for high impact speeds or enhanced thermal softening, two shear bands, one at 128 - to it propagate from the notch tip. Otherwise, only one shear band nearly parallel to the notch-ligament initiates at the notch-tip. The notch-tip distortion for high strength materials is quite different from that for low strength materials. The <b>maximum</b> <b>tensile</b> principal <b>stress</b> occurs at a point on the upper surface of the notch-tip and for every set of values of material parameters and impact speeds studied equals about 2. 3 times the yield stress of the material in a iii quasistatic simple tension or compression test.

METHODS: The concrete pavement containing the box culvert with different skewed angles and soil cover depths was modeled by 3 dimensional finite element method. The contact boundary condition was used between concrete and soil structures in addition to the nonlinear material property of soil in the finite element model. A dynamic analysis was performed by applying the self weight of pavement, negative temperature gradient of slab, and moving vehicle load simultaneously.

40|$|AbstractThe {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) {{crack propagation}} {{is a hot}} issue in rock mechanics. To properly simulate 3 D crack propagation, a modified <b>maximum</b> tangential <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> criterion is proposed. In this modified criterion, it is supposed that cracks propagate only at crack front in the principal normal plane. The tangential <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> at crack front in the principal normal plane in local coordinates is employed to determine crack propagation, which is calculated through coordinate transformation from global to local coordinates. New cracks will propagate when the <b>maximum</b> tangential <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> at crack front in the principal normal plane reaches the tensile strength of rock-like materials. Compared with the previous crack propagation criteria, the modified crack propagation criterion is helpful in calculating 3 D crack stress intensity factor, and can overcome the limitations of propagation step determined by individual experiences in previous studies. Finally, the 3 D crack propagation process is traced by element-free Galerkin method. The numerical results agree well with the experimental ones for a frozen resin sample with prefabricated 3 D cracks...|$|R
