50|$|A <b>Machmeter</b> is an {{aircraft}} pitot-static system flight instrument thatshows {{the ratio of}} the true airspeed to the speed of sound, a dimensionless quantity called Mach number. This is shown on a <b>Machmeter</b> as a decimal fraction.An aircraft flying at the speed of sound is flyingat a Mach number of one, expressed as Mach 1.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Machmeter</b> is, on subsonic {{aircraft}}, {{a warning}} indicator. Subsonic aircraft must not fly {{faster than a}} specific percentage {{of the speed of}} sound. Usually passenger airliners do not fly faster than around 85% of speed of sound, or Mach 0.85. Supersonic aircraft, like the Concorde and military fighters, use the <b>Machmeter</b> as the main speed instrument with the exception of take-offs and landings.|$|E

5000|$|Jet {{aircraft}} do {{not have}} VNO and VNE like piston-engined aircraft, but instead have a maximum operating IAS, VMO and maximum Mach number, MMO. To observe both limits, the pilot of a jet airplane needs both an airspeed indicator and a <b>Machmeter,</b> each with appropriate red lines. In some general aviation jet airplanes, the <b>Machmeter</b> is combined into a single instrument that contains a pair of concentric indicators, one for the indicated airspeed {{and the other for}} indicated Mach number.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{electronic}} Machmeters {{use information}} from an {{air data computer}} system which makes calculations using inputs from a pitot-static system. Some older mechanical Machmeters use an altitude aneroid and an airspeed capsule which together convert pitot-static pressure into Mach number. The <b>Machmeter</b> suffers from instrument and position errors.|$|E
5000|$|Aircraft {{capable of}} flying {{close to their}} {{critical}} Mach number usually carry a <b>machmeter,</b> an instrument which indicates speed in Mach number terms. As part of certifying aircraft in the United States of America, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certifies a maximum Mach number for operation, or MMO.|$|E
50|$|In simple aircraft, {{without an}} air data {{computer}} or <b>Machmeter,</b> true airspeed can be calculated {{as a function of}} calibrated airspeed and local air density (or static air temperature and pressure altitude, which determine density). Some airspeed indicators incorporate a slide rule mechanism to perform this calculation. Otherwise, it can be performed using this applet or a device such as the E6B (a handheld circular slide rule).|$|E
50|$|Modern jet airliners {{also include}} ground speed (GS) and <b>Machmeter.</b> Ground speed shows the actual speed that the {{aircraft}} uses {{compared to the}} ground. This is usually connected to a GPS or similar system. Ground speed is just a pilot aid to estimate if the flight is on time, behind or ahead of schedule. It is not used for takeoff and landing purposes, since the imperative speed for a flying aircraft always is the speed against the wind.|$|E
40|$|Problems {{involved}} in measuring speed and altitude with pressure-actuated instruments (altimeter, airspeed indicator, true-airspeed indicator, <b>Machmeter,</b> and vertical-speed indicator) are examined. Equations relating total pressure and static {{pressure to the}} five flight quantities are presented, and criteria {{for the design of}} total and static pressure tubes are given. Calibrations of typical static pressure installations (fuselage nose, wing tip, vertical fin, and fuselage vent) are presented, various methods for flight calibration of these installations are described, and the calibration of a particular installation by two of the methods is described in detail. Equations are given for estimating the effects of pressure lag and leaks. Test procedures for the laboratory calibration of the five instruments are described, and accuracies of mechanical and electrical instruments are presented. Operational use of the altimeter for terrain clearance and vertical separation of aircraft is discussed, along with flight technical errors and overall altitude errors of aircraft in cruise operations. Altitude-measuring techniques based on a variety of properties of the Earth and the atmosphere are included. Two appendixes present airspeed and altitude tables and sample calculations for determining the various flight parameters from measured total and static pressures...|$|E
40|$|Low-speed {{tests of}} a pilotless {{aircraft}} {{were conducted in}} the Langley propeller-research tunnel to provide information for the estimation of the longitudinal stability and. control, to measure the aileron effectiveness, and to calibrate the radome and the <b>Machmeter</b> pitot-static orifices. It {{was found that the}} model possessed a stEb. le variation of elevator angle required for trim throughout the speed range at the design angle of attack. A comparison of the airplane with and without JATO units and with an alternate rocket booster showed that a large loss in longitudinal stability and control resulting from the addition of the rocket booster to the aircraft was sufficient to make the rocket-booster assembly unsatisfactory as an alternate for the JATO units. Reversal of the aileron effectiveness was evident at positive deflections of the vertical wing flap indicating that the roll-stabilization system would produce roiling moments in a tight right turn contrary to its design purpose. Vertical-wing-flap deflections caused large errors in the static-pressure reading obtained by the original static-tube installation. A practical installation point on the fuselage was located which should yield reliable measurement of the free-stream static pressure...|$|E
40|$|This Section {{provides}} a brief introduction to airdata measurement and calibration. Readers will learn about typical test objectives, quantities to measure, and flight maneuvers and operations for calibration. The Section informs readers about tower-flyby, trailing cone, pacer, radar-tracking, and dynamic airdata calibration maneuvers. Readers will also {{begin to understand}} how some data analysis considerations and special airdata cases, including high-angle-of-attack flight, high-speed flight, and nonobtrusive sensors are handled. This section {{is not intended to}} be all inclusive; readers should review AGARDograph 300, Volume 1, "Calibration of Airdata Systems and Flow Direction Sensors" for more detailed information. [11 - 1] References 11 - 2, 11 - 3, and 11 - 4 also supply pertinent information to better understand airdata measurement and calibration and related terminology. Airdata are vital to successfully complete an aircraft's mission and are derived from the air surrounding the aircraft. These airdata encompass indicated and true airspeed, pressure altitude, ambient air temperature, angles of attack and sideslip, Mach number, and rate of climb. Typically, pitot and static pressures are sensed and converted (by mechanical means in the instruments themselves) into indications on the altimeter, vertical speed indicator, airspeed indicator, and <b>Machmeter.</b> Similarly, measured local flow angles establish angles of attack and sideslip, and the outside air temperature is measured and indicated in the cockpit. (Instruments that can perform the conversion, such as airspeed indicators, altimeters, and Machmeters, do not correct for errors in the input values.) These measured parameters are commonly input to the airdata computer which, using appropriate algorithms and correction factors (or calibrations, as discussed later), can provide other parameters, such as true airspeed, required by the aircraft's avionics or flight control system. The presence of the aircraft in the airstream causes input errors to the measuring instruments - the aircraft disturbs the air that it flies through, thereby also disturbing the airdata measurements. Figure 11 - 1 shows the airflow around an airplane wing. The air above the wing has lower pressure than the ambient air, while the pressure below the wing is higher than the ambient air. Compressibility and shock waves also disturb the air and affect the measurements. Compressibility effects become important above approximately Mach number 0. 3. As a result the static pressure around an airplane varies considerably with location. Local flow angles also differ from the free-stream flow direction. In straight-and-level flight the airflow rises to the wing leading edge and falls below the trailing edge, causing errors in flow direction measurements. To some extent these errors can be studied in wind tunnels, but wind-tunnel measurements cannot replace in-flight measurements...|$|E
