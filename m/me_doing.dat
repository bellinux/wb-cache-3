500|$|Ali {{learned that}} his {{regurgitation}} talents {{had the potential to}} entertain and to earn money through performance at the age of fifteen:I tried out my tricks first of all in the street, swallowing many glasses of water and then pouring forth a great fountain {{from one side of the}} road to the other...
