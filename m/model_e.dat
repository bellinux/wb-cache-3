It could be linked with another <b>Model</b> <b>E</b> to control up to 16 channels; two units could be mounted side-by-side in only 1U of rack space. The Model E's popularity came with many critical requests for features, and in May 2008 the Model E-1 was introduced; an incremental improvement to replace the <b>Model</b> <b>E.</b> It allowed ADAT Lightpipe interconnections between linked units and a digital mixing console, helpful with Yamaha, Mackie and other digital audio gear containing ADAT inputs and outputs.

Most of the studies deal with appropriate models for this complex type of traffic and use trace-driven simulations to assess the performance of high-speed networks carrying this type of traffic.

The algorithms are easy to implement and provide good cell loss estimates over a wide range of buffer sizes. 1 Introduction In recent years, the modeling of VBR video traffic attracted a lot {{of interest}}.

40|$|A {{category}} of item response models is presented with two defining features: they all (i) have a tree representation, and (ii) {{are members of}} the family of generalized linear mixed models (GLMM). Because the models are based on trees, they are denoted as IRTree models. The GLMM nature of the models implies that they can all be estimated with the glmer function of the lme 4 package in R. The aim of the article is to present four subcategories of models, the first two of which are based on a tree representation for response categories: 1. linear response tree <b>models</b> (<b>e.</b> g., missing response models), 2. nested response tree <b>models</b> (<b>e.</b> g., <b>models</b> for parallel observations regarding item responses such as agreement and certainty), while the last two are based on a tree representation for latent variables: 3. linear latent-variable tree <b>models</b> (<b>e.</b> g., <b>models</b> for change processes), and 4. nested latent-variable tree <b>models</b> (<b>e.</b> g., bi-factor <b>models).</b> The use of the glmer function is illustrated for all four subcategories. Simulated example data sets and two service functions useful in preparing the data for IRTree modeling with glmer are provided {{in the form of an}} R package, irtrees. For all four subcategories also a real data application is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Motivated by the {{conclusions}} from various modelling studies, {{modifications to the}} bioenergy sector regulations are under way in Europe and in the USA to account for emissions from indirect land-use change (ILUC). Despite their influence on the policy-making, evaluations of the capacity of numerical models to estimate ILUC are sparse. To address this void, this paper reviews recent developments in land-use modelling, with a particular focus on the solutions adopted to estimate ILUC due to biofuel production. As indirect effects of bioenergy result from the interplay of various mechanisms, their modelling is a major challenge for land-use science. In recent years, numerical models have been significantly upgraded {{to provide a more}} comprehensive vision of the agricultural system. This has been performed by improving the representation of land supply and the biofuel production process in general equilibrium <b>models</b> (<b>e.</b> g., GTAP, MIRAGE, DART). At the same time, modelling systems coupling partial equilibrium <b>models</b> with CGE (<b>e.</b> g., KLUM@GTAP) or economic modules with spatially explicit <b>models</b> (<b>e.</b> g., MAgPIE, GLOBIOM, LEITAP), and modelling architecture combining land-use and life-cycle assessment <b>models</b> (<b>e.</b> g., FASOM/FAPRI/GREET) have been developed.

40|$|People {{experience}} regulatory fit {{when they}} pursue a goal {{in a manner}} that sustains their regulatory orientation (E. T. Higgins, 2000). Five studies tested whether the value experienced from regulatory fit can transfer to a subsequent evaluation of an object. In Studies 1 and 2, participants gave the same coffee mug a higher price if they had chosen it with a strategy that fit their orientation (eager strategy/promotion; vigilant strategy/prevention) than a strategy that did not fit. Studies 3 – 5 investigated possible mechanisms underlying this effect. Value transfer was independent of positive mood, perceived effectiveness (instrumentality), and perceived efficiency (ease), and occurred for an object that was independent of the fit process itself. The findings supported a value confusion account of transfer. There is no more important variable in motivation and decision making than value. In thinking about value, no concept has been more central than the hedonic principle. People approach pleasure and avoid pain. This hedonic principle underlies a wide variety of motivation and decision-making models, including animal learning <b>models</b> (<b>e.</b> g., Mowrer, 1960; Thorndike, 1935), personality <b>models</b> (<b>e.</b> g., Atkinson, 1964), social psychological <b>models</b> (<b>e.</b> g. ...|$|R
