50|$|Up to a {{few years}} ago, Laurenzana was famous for the {{production}} of high quality liquors produced in four distilleries situated within the village. Handicraft activities regarding the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> barrels, bagpipes and wrought-iron were also widespread. The economy of the village is mainly based on agriculture; in fact, it is possible to find silviculture and animal breeding farms producing delicious dairy products.|$|R
50|$|According to Pliny the Elder, Nuceria was {{inhabited}} by two tribes, one the Nucerini Favonienses (faithful of Favonia, also named Fauna, a Goddess) {{and the other}} Camellani (originating from Camerinum, or possibly makers <b>of</b> camellae, small <b>wooden</b> <b>containers).</b> Strabo records that the town was famous for the production <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> vases (possibly barrels).|$|R
50|$|Following the Civil War {{however, the}} {{shipbuilding}} industry experienced a severe slump. All Philadelphia shipbuilders engaged {{exclusively in the}} <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> vessels were {{forced out of the}} industry, with the exception of Birely & Sons and Hillman & Streaker, which survived by pooling resources and merging in 1866 to become Birely, Hillman & Streaker. The new company's shipyard was located at the foot of Montgomery Avenue, Philadelphia.|$|R
5000|$|It {{stands on}} a hill 387 m {{above mean sea level}} in the {{sub-region}} of Murgia. It is also called [...] "The Ionian Spy" [...] for its strategic geographical position. From various points of the town all of the Gulf of Taranto can be seen.The economy is based mostly on agriculture and food production (olives, wine, citrus fruits, vegetables). Tourism and the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> fixtures are also being developed.|$|R
50|$|Mining in the Ore Mountains {{was given}} new life during the First and Second World Wars {{in order to}} supply raw materials. The Third Reich also saw the {{resumption}} of silver mining. Afterwards the people returned to the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> products and toys, especially in the Eastern Ore Mountains. The clock industry is centred on Glashütte. In the Western Ore Mountains, economic alternatives were offered by the engineering and textile industries.|$|R
5|$|Adults have {{extremely}} variable lifespans, from {{weeks to}} years, {{depending on the}} species. Some wood-boring beetles can have extremely long life-cycles. It is believed that when furniture or house timbers are infested by beetle larvae, the timber already contained the larvae {{when it was first}} sawn up. A birch bookcase 40 years old released adult Eburia quadrigeminata (Cerambycidae), while Buprestis aurulenta and other Buprestidae have been documented as emerging as much as 51 years after <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> items.|$|R
5000|$|The American elm's wood is coarse, hard, and tough, with interlacing, contorted fibers {{that make}} it {{difficult}} to split or chop, and cause it to warp after sawing. [...] Accordingly, the wood originally had few uses, save for making hubs for wagon wheels. [...] Later, with the advent of mechanical sawing, American elm wood was used for barrel staves, trunk-slats, and hoop-poles, and subsequently became fundamental to the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> automobile bodies, with the intricate fibers holding screws unusually well.|$|R
50|$|During an {{exploratory}} overflight in 1988, local amateur historians recognised {{the traces of}} a large tumulus in a field 300 m south of the oppidum. Between 1994 and 1997, the State Archaeological Service of Hesse excavated it. The mound (mound 1) originally had a diameter of nearly 50 m and a height of 6 m. It {{was surrounded by a}} circular ditch 10 m wide. At the time, {{it must have been a}} visually extremely striking monument. The tumulus contained three features.

Maidenhead Railway Bridge {{is known for its}} flat arch, built in 1839 with 39-metre spans. The Wealden iron {{industry}} in the Weald was the site of the first blast furnace in Britain in 1491, and produced much of Britain's cast iron until the 1770s. Portsmouth Block Mills were the site of the world's first metal machine tools, built for the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> pulleys, invented by Henry Maudslay, and the site of the world's first industrial assembly line in 1803.|$|R
5000|$|The company {{initially}} {{specialized in}} the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> hand printing presses, but later added saw-making. In 1819 the company expanded to printing presses.

50|$|Steam bending is a {{woodworking}} technique where {{strips of}} wood are steam heated using a steam box. The applied heat and moisture makes the wood pliable enough to easily bend around a former {{to create a}} specific shape. The moulding process is usually done by clamping the strips of wood to a positive form, with the strips of wood often reinforced on the outside with a metal band to prevent blowout. The method {{has been used in}} the manufacturing of a diverse range of products, some examples being wooden boat building where it is used in the shaping of hull's ribs and lap boards, the production <b>of</b> traditional <b>wooden</b> lacrosse sticks, musical instruments such as violins and in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> furniture like the Windsor chair and much of Michael Thonet's work.|$|R

50|$|In 1898, George Bullock {{relocated}} his Bullock Electric Manufacturing Company to {{the northeast}} corner of Forest Avenue and Park avenue and it became one of Norwood's first industrial plants, following McFarlan Lumber Company on Montgomery Pike and the Cincinnati Brick Company on Duck Creek. The plant was eventually acquired by German company, Siemens, and still remains in operation to this day in the same building. In 1900, the Globe Wernicke Company constructed a new factory on a 14-acre site on Carthage Avenue in Norwood for the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> bookcases (the bookcases are now collectible and desirable antiques). In 1901, the United States Playing Card Company moved to its new facilities on Beech Avenue in Norwood. One year later, the American Laundry Machinery Company opened a five-acre factory at Ross and Section Avenues.|$|R
50|$|The {{industrial}} sector {{is dominated by}} mining, given the abundance of underground resources. Also of note are textiles, chemicals/pharmaceuticals, metalworking and steel, glass and ceramics, clothing and printing/publishing sectors. Smaller areas specialising in manufacturing and craft industries {{are found in the}} hinterland: the leather and footwear area in the south-west part of the province of Florence, the hot-house plant area in Pistoia, the ceramics and textile industries in the Prato area, scooters and motorcycles in Pontedera, and the processing of timber for the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> furniture in the Cascina area. The heavy industries (mining, steel and mechanical engineering) are concentrated along the coastal strip (Livorno and Pisa areas), where there are also important chemical industries. Also of note are the marble (Carrara area) and paper industries (Lucca area).|$|R
5000|$|Some of {{the larger}} maple species have {{valuable}} timber, particularly Sugar maple in North America, and Sycamore maple in Europe. Sugar maple wood—often known as [...] "hard maple"—is the wood of choice for bowling pins, bowling alley lanes, pool cue shafts, and butcher's blocks. Maple wood is also used for the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> baseball bats, though less often than ash or hickory due to the tendency of maple bats to shatter when broken. The maple bat was introduced to Major League Baseball (MLB) in 1998 by Sam Bat founder Sam Holman. Today it is the standard maple bat most in use by professional baseball. Maple is also commonly used in archery as the core material in the limbs of a Recurve Bow due to its stiffness and strength.|$|R
50|$|In 1772, Red Ruthenia, {{together}} with other areas of southwestern Poland, {{became a part of}} Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria — a crownland of the Habsburg Monarchy as part of the First Partition of Poland. Industry came to Buchach around the end of the 19th century. Among the small-scale industries there included a brickworks, and candle and soap factory, (modern) flour mills, a textile plant, and a necktie factory. The town also boasted a brewery and a winery. The largest factory was established early in the 1900s, when the Hilfesverein concern of Vienna set up a plant for the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> toys in Buchach employing some 200 workers, mainly young girls. In 1912 the Stanislaviv-based Savings and Credit Union opened a branch in Buchach, and this served as a bank for local industrialists and business.|$|R

50|$|There {{are various}} {{preservation}} technologies used to prepare elenski but that typically vary considerably from family to family, {{as opposed to}} regionally. In the past, the rounds were put in well trampled upon maize meal or processed with lime milk. The meat could also be stored in specially sewn bags <b>of</b> cheesecloth or <b>wooden</b> <b>containers</b> with thick nets instead of walls (muharnik), but is as a rule put somewhere airy, where the clear mountain air could aid the drying and conservation, and also {{in order to prevent}} houseflies to lay eggs on the rounds.|$|R
50|$|The early {{inhabitants}} of the Altastenberg were herdsmen, charcoal burners and cart drivers.
