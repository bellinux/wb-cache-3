50|$|<b>Mitobronitol</b> (1,6-dibromo-1,6-dideoxy-D-mannitol) is a {{brominated}} analog of mannitol. It is an anticancer {{drug that}} {{is classified as}} an alkylating agent.|$|E
50|$|As {{with any}} {{functional}} group, {{the hazards of}} halohydrins are difficult to generalize as they may form part of an almost limitless series of compounds, with each structure having different pharmacology. In general, simpler low molecular weight compounds are often toxic and carcinogenic (e.g. 2-chloroethanol, 3-MCPD) {{by virtue of being}} alkylating agents. This reactivity can be put to good use, for instance in the anti-cancer drug <b>mitobronitol.</b> A number of synthetic corticosteroids exist baring a fluorohydrin motif (triamcinolone, dexamethasone).|$|E
40|$|Forty-three {{patients}} with chronic myeloid leukaemia have been treated with hydroxyurea {{in order to be}} subjected to leucopheresis for white cell transfusions. Hydroxyurea decreases leucocytosis when it is administered and the blood granulocyte number increases soon after the drug is stopped. The survival of the patients is not different from the survival of the patients treated with conventional chemotherapy (busulphan, <b>mitobronitol)</b> and it is superior to the survival of patients treated with external radiotherapy or with 32 P. Half of the patients were subjected to splenectomy during first remission for a phase II trial. They were not randomized, but the distribution according to age was similar in the two groups. A slight difference appears in favour of splenectomy so far as survival is concerned, but there were three post-operative deaths out of 18 patients. We conclude that a phase II trial on the value of splenectomy is indicated ethically, but that the patients should be operated on and nursed in a microbiologically controlled environment...|$|E
