Domperidone {{is a specific}} blocker of dopamine receptors Solvent casting method was used for preparation <b>of</b> fast dissolving <b>film.</b> Various film forming polymers were evaluated for selection of suitable polymer. Different polymers like maltodextrin, polyvinyl alcohol and different grades of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose like HPMC E 5 LV, HPMC E 15 LV and HPMC E 3 LV were used in study for selection of polymers. Amongst them HPMC E 3 LV, HPMC E 5 LV was selected as film forming polymer and propylene glycol was used as plasticizer. For solubility enhancement inclusion complex from β-cyclodextine was prepared by kneading method. Films were evaluated for physical and mechanical properties, drug content, disintegration time, in vitro dissolution and stability study. Prepared films showed satisfactory physical and mechanical properties. Drug-excepients interaction study (IR spectroscopy), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Drug content, disintegration time and in vitro dissolution were also acceptable. 32 factorial design were used for optimization <b>of</b> <b>film</b> <b>formulation.</b> Batch F 4 {{was found to be}} optimized <b>film</b> <b>formulation</b> which has 35. 33 second disintegration time, tensile strength 2. 180 N/cm 2, drug release 75. 26 % after 15 min.

40|$|Millions {{of tons of}} food plastic {{packaging}} have been produced and deposited for decades. These types of plastics are made <b>of</b> petroleum-based <b>materials</b> and they are called synthetic plastics which are expensive, toxic, totally non-biodegradable and may contribute to environmental pollution. Great concerns regarding environmental issue has produced an alternative idea to replace the synthetic plastic with biodegradable plastics based on sago starch. This research focuses on the synthesis and characterization <b>of</b> biodegradable sago <b>film</b> <b>formulation.</b> In order to obtain the optimal conditions in developing the films, optimization process has been carried out. The sago <b>film</b> <b>formulations</b> were characterized using scanning electro n microscopy for the morphology study <b>of</b> <b>film</b> <b>formulation.</b> Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy had successfully shown the chemical structure and bonding while cinnamaldehyde had successfully inhibited E. coli bacteria growth by using agar diffusion method. A central composite design technique from response surface methodology was used to investigate the effects of independent variables on biodegradable sago <b>film</b> <b>formulation</b> properties. Biodegradable sago <b>film</b> <b>formulation</b> was analyzed for tensile strength (TS), elongation at break (EB), elastic modulus (EM) and water vapor permeability (WVP). The statistical analysis {{results show that the}} data appropriately fitted a second-order polynomial model where the coefficients of determination, R 2 are 0. 8192, 0. 8451, 0. 8036 and 0. 8941 for TS, EB, EM and WVP respectively. The independent variables of linear sago/chitosan blend and quadratic cinnamaldehyde had significant effect on TS. The linear cinnamaldehyde and quadratic cinnamaldehyde and glycerol/sorbitol-plasticized had significant effect on EB. Meanwhile, EM was significantly affected by both linear sago/chitosan and cinnamaldehyde and quadratically by glycerol/sorbitol-plasticized. The WVP was significantly affected by both linear sago/chitosan and glycerol/sorbitol-plasticized. The results show that the best <b>film</b> <b>formulations</b> for sago <b>film</b> <b>formulation</b> within the experimental ranges are 16. 36 wt. % sago/chitosan, 41. 11 wt. % glycerol/sorbitol and 0. 7350 wt. % cinnamaldehyde for 135. 49 MPa of TS; 57. 01 wt. % sago/chitosan, 59. 14 wt. % glycerol/sorbitol and 0. 6400 wt. % cinnamaldehyde for 0. 6012 % EB and 41. 03 wt. % sago/chitosan, 30. 32 wt. % glycerol/sorbitol and 0. 8364 wt. % cinnamaldehyde for 8. 45 x 106 MPa of EM. Furthermore, for the optimum composition of 1 x 10 - 7 g/Pa. s. m 2 of WVP, the experimental values are 79. 66 wt. % sago/chitosan, 83. 64 wt. % glycerol/sorbitol and 0. 5430 wt. % cinnamaldehyde. Finally, the present findings indicate that the biodegradable sago-based film can be a potential plastic packing with appropriate optimized formulation value...|$|R

Guy Sherwin studied painting at Chelsea School of Art in the 1960 s before becoming {{closely associated with the}} British avant garde film movement centred on The London Film-makers Co-operative in the 1970 s. His film works, often including serial forms and live performance, are characterized by an enduring concern with time and light as the fundamentals of cinema. Optical Sound Films explores in detail one of his particular and recurrent concerns, the synaesthesic relationship between sound and image manifest in the <b>material</b> <b>of</b> <b>film</b> sound. These investigations take Sherwin from physical manipulation <b>of</b> the very <b>material</b> <b>of</b> <b>film</b> through to live performances utilising multiple <b>film</b> projectors, all <b>of</b> which are explicated through drawings, diagrams, video documentation as well the films themselves. This publication provides a unique insight into conceptual and practical concerns for artists’ working with film as well as a detailed exploration of the processes and technology involved in its production and exhibition.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to develop {{biodegradable}} plastic with natural colourants as packaging <b>material.</b> Blends <b>of</b> anthocyanin and bromocresol purple (BCP) as biological and chemical colourants respectively, tapioca starch, glycerol, polyethylene grafted maleic anhydride (PE-g-MA), clay, nanocomposites and low density polyethylene (LDPE) with different formulation contents for five types of blends were prepared using a lab scale twin screw extruder. A series of low density polyethylene (LDPE) with different blends formulation were developed via blow film extrusion. The morphology and properties of the blends were evaluated by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The dispersion of tapioca starch in the LDPE matrix was homogeneous and mechanical properties <b>of</b> the <b>films</b> were improved with the addition of glycerol. The interfacial adhesion between tapioca starch and LDPE was further improved by the addition of PEg-MA according to the morphological structure shown by SEM micrographs, thus enhanced the mechanical properties <b>of</b> the <b>films.</b> <b>Formulations</b> containing 35 % tapioca starch with fairly high concentrations of additives indicate the importance of the concentration of starch and the presence of additives on the biodegradability <b>of</b> tapioca starch-LDPE <b>film</b> blends...|$|R

FTIR spectra and DSC thermograms showed good compatibility between RB and other components <b>of</b> <b>film</b> <b>formulation.</b> In addition, SEM images confirmed uniform distribution <b>of</b> RB in <b>films.</b> In vitro drug release profiles, disintegration and dissolution time, swelling properties, mechanical properties, and mucoadhesive characteristics <b>of</b> RB-loaded <b>films</b> were investigated. F 1, F 3, and F 5 formulations had burst release effect {{and they could}} be applicable for treatment of pain phase of migraine. Among these formulations, F 1 formulation had suitable disintegration and dissolution rate along with appropriate mechanical properties. In addition, it showed about 99.89 % RB released in 45  min and ex vivo residence time was observed in 13  min when film started to disintegrate and loose shape. On the other hand, F 2, F 4, and F 6 formulations have shown more sustained delivery mechanism compared to other formulations. F 2 formulation had the highest tensile strength, ex vivo mucoadhesive strength, and swelling percentage, which is 12.005  MPa, 0.790  N, and 30 %, respectively. Therefore, it can be a prominent option in extended release of RB for treatment of aura or prodrome phase of migraine. It also showed about 100.16 % RB released in 80  min. Among F 1 and F 2 formulations, F 1 was selected as an optimized formulation because of complete release in lower time. In the present work, we focused on preparing new different <b>formulations</b> <b>of</b> mucoadhesive buccal <b>films</b> which could release 10  mg of RB in 40 – 80  min along with good mucoadhesive strength. These films were developed and characterized with different physical and mechanical parameters. In the next step, we suggest that ex vivo permeation test along with in vivo study in future will confirm these in vitro results. Overall, this research can be an innovative and promising work for RB delivery in migraine treatment.|$|R
