40|$|A new {{semi-automatic}} {{method for}} segmenting {{the spinal cord}} from MR images is presented. The method {{is based on an}} active surface (AS) model of the cord surface, with intrinsic smoothness constraints. The model is initialized by the user marking the approximate cord center-line on a few representative slices, and the compact surface parametrization results in a rapid segmentation, taking on the order of 1 min. Using 3 -D acquired T(1) -weighted images of the cervical spine from human controls and patients with multiple sclerosis, the intra- and inter-observer reproducibilities were evaluated, and compared favorably with an existing cord segmentation method. While the AS method overestimated the cord area by approximately 14 % compared to manual outlining, correlations between cord cross-sectional area and clinical disability scores confirmed the relevance of the new method in <b>measuring</b> <b>cord</b> atrophy in multiple sclerosis. Segmentation of the cord from 2 -D multi-slice T(2) -weighted images is also demonstrated over the cervical and thoracic region. Since the cord center-line is an intrinsic parameter extracted as part of the segmentation process, the image can be resampled such that the center-line forms one coordinate axis of a new image, allowing simple visualization of the cord structure and pathology; this could find wider application in standard radiological practice. 2128...|$|E

The mean osteocalcin concentrations in term newborns (100 - 110 micrograms/l) were comparable with levels that we previously measured in pubertal children. There was a small increase in mean osteocalcin concentrations during the third trimester of fetal life, with the maximum at 35 weeks; between weeks 36 and 41, the osteocalcin levels dropped by 13 %. Osteocalcin was 20 % lower in IUGR neonates than in age- or weight-matched newborns. The newborns of diabetic mothers had markedly lower osteocalcin concentrations than the weight-matched neonates, and 16 of the 19 samples were more than 1 SD below {{the mean of the}} gestational-age osteocalcin regression curve.

Understanding the effect of covariates such as age, gender, brain volumes, and skull- and vertebra-derived metrics on cervical and thoracic spinal cord TCA and GM areas in healthy subjects would be fundamental for exploring compartment specific changes in neurological diseases affecting the spinal cord. Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging at 3 T we investigated 32 healthy subjects using a 2 D phase sensitive inversion recovery sequence and we measured TCA, GM and WM areas at 4 cervical and thoracic levels of the spinal cord. We assessed age and gender relationships of <b>cord</b> <b>measures</b> and explored associations between <b>cord</b> <b>measures</b> and a) brain volumes and b) skull- and vertebra-derived metrics.

40|$|Background. Severe malarial anemia (SMA) {{remains a}} major cause of {{pediatric}} illness and mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa. Here we test the hypothesis that prenatal exposures, reflected by soluble inflammatory mediators in cord blood, can condition an individual’s susceptibility to SMA. Methods. In a Tanzanian birth cohort (n = 743), we <b>measured</b> <b>cord</b> blood concentrations of tumor necrosis fac-tor (TNF), TNF receptors I and II (TNF-RI and TNF-RII), interleukin (IL) - 1 β, IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 6, IL- 10, and interferon gamma (IFN-γ). After adjusting for conventional covariates, we calculated the hazard ratios (HR) for time to first SMA event with log(e) cytokine concentrations dichotomized at the median, by quartile, and per standard deviation (SD) increase. Results. Low levels of TNF, TNF-RI, IL- 1 β, and IL- 5 and high levels of TNF-RII were associated statistically significantly and respectively with approximately 3 -fold, 2 -fold, 8 -fold, 4 -fold, and 3 -fold increased risks of SMA (Hb < 50 g/L). TNF, TNF-RI, and IL- 1 β concentrations were inversely and log-linearly associated with SMA risk; the HR (95 % confidence interval [CI]) per 1 -SD increase were respectively 0. 81 (. 65, 1. 02), 0. 76 (. 62,. 92), and 0. 50 (. 40,. 62).

Methods We <b>measured</b> <b>cord</b> serum 25 (OH) D levels, bone mineral content (BMC), bone mineral density (BMD) and their changes over 3 months of life with 400 IU/day of vitamin D 3 supplementation. Results Cord serum 25 (OH) D was significantly lower in Hispanic than non-Hispanic Caucasian infants (16. 4 ± 6. 5 ng/mL, n = 27, vs 22. 3 ± 9. 4 n = 22, p = 0. 013). Among 38 infants who completed a 3 month vitamin D supplementation intervention, provision of 400 IU/day of vitamin D increased final 25 (OH) D {{to a higher level}} in non-Hispanic Caucasian compared to Hispanic infants. There was no significant relationship between cord serum 25 (OH) D and BMC or BMD {{in the first week of}} life (n = 49) or after 3 months of vitamin D supplementation.

We conducted a case-control study of well-defined severe falciparum malaria nested within a longitudinal birth cohort of Kenyan children. We <b>measured</b> <b>cord</b> blood total IgG levels against five recombinant merozoite antigens and antibody function in the growth inhibition activity and neutrophil antibody-dependent respiratory burst assays.

40|$|Rationale: Respiratory {{infections in}} early life are {{associated}} with risk for wheezing bronchiolitis, especially in children {{at high risk of}} atopy. The underlying mechanisms are unknown, but are suspected to involve imbalance(s) in host defense responses against pathogens stemming from functional immaturity of the immune system in this age group. Objectives: To assess the contribution of eosinophil-trophic IL- 5, and the potent antiinflammatory cytokine IL- 10, to risk for infection in early life. Measurements and Main Results: We prospectively monitored a cohort of 198 high-risk children to age 5 years, recording every acute respiratory infection episode and classifying them by severity. We <b>measured</b> <b>cord</b> blood T-cell capacity to produce IL- 10 and IL- 5, and related these functions to subsequent infection history. IL- 10 and IL- 5 were associated, respectively, with resistance versus susceptibility to infections. The greatest contrasting effects of these two cytokines were seen when they were considered in combination by generating IL- 10 /IL- 5 response ratios for each subject. The low IL- 10 /high IL- 5 T-cell response phenotype was strongly associated with susceptibility to all grades of acute respiratory infection, relative to the more resistant high IL- 10 /low IL- 5 phenotype. Conclusions: Excessive production of IL- 5 by T cells at birth is associated with heightened risk for subsequent severe respiratory infections, and this risk is attenuated by concomitant IL- 10 production. The underlying mechanisms may involve IL- 10 -mediated feedback inhibition of IL- 5 -dependent eosinophil-induced inflammation, which is a common feature of host antiviral responses in early life...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that diabetes during pregnancy leads to chromosomal DNA damage and telomere attrition in the feto placental unit and cord blood, and provides evidence for intrauterine programming towards a senescent phenotype in the offspring. METHODS: We obtained cord blood from pregnant women with pregestational Type 1 diabetes (n= 26), Type 2 diabetes (n= 20) or gestational diabetes (n= 71), and control subjects without diabetes (n= 45, n= 76 and n= 81, respectively) matched for maternal and gestational age. We <b>measured</b> <b>cord</b> blood mononuclear cell telomere length, telomerase activity (a reverse transcriptase that limits telomere attrition), and concentrations of insulin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (sICAM- 1). RESULTS: We found {{no significant differences between}} groups in cord blood telomere length in any nucleated cell type, or in hs-CRP or sICAM- 1 concentrations, but telomerase activity was higher in cord blood from Type 1 (P< 0. 05) and gestational diabetes pregnancies (P< 0. 05), but not in Type 2 diabetes pregnancies. There were no significant relationships between glycaemic control, cord blood telomere length, telomerase activity or inflammatory markers in any group. CONCLUSIONS: We found no difference in cord blood telomere length in pregnancies of women with diabetes compared with control subjects, but higher cord blood telomerase activity in Type 1 and gestational diabetes. This may reflect upregulated telomere reverse transcriptase in response to in utero oxidative DNA and telomere damage. These observations are relevant to {{the hypothesis that}} diabetes during pregnancy leads to in utero preprogramming towards senescence in the offspring...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{compare the}} {{endocrine}} and cardiometabolic cord blood characteristics of offspring of mothers with {{polycystic ovary syndrome}} (PCOS) with those of healthy controls. Design Cross-sectional case control study. Setting University medical centers. Patient(s) Offspring from mothers with PCOS (n = 61) and healthy controls (n = 82). Intervention(s) Cord blood withdrawal from neonates. Main Outcome <b>Measure(s)</b> <b>Cord</b> blood estradiol, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, free androgen index (FAI), insulin, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, c-reactive protein, adiponectin, and leptin. Result(s) Androstenedione and leptin concentrations were increased in the offspring of women with PCOS compared with the controls: androstenedione median 2. 9 (interquartile range [IQR] 2. 3 – 3. 9) nmol/L vs. 2. 2 [IQR 1. 6 – 2. 7] nmol/L; and leptin median 13. 6 [IQR 8. 3 – 22. 9] μg/L vs. 9. 8 [IQR 6. 0 – 16. 5] μg/L. After adjusting for maternal and pregnancy-related confounders (such as maternal age, gestational age, birth weight), androstenedione appeared associated with PCOS in both male (relative change 1. 36 [1. 04; 1. 78]) and female offspring (relative change 1. 40 [1. 08; 1. 82]). Similarly, in male offspring the leptin concentrations appeared associated with PCOS after correction for confounders (relative change 1. 55 [1. 12; 2. 14]). After correction for multiple testing, these associations attenuated. Conclusion(s) Observed results suggest that androstenedione concentrations are increased in the cord blood {{of male and female}} offspring of women with PCOS, although this requires confirmation. This finding would support the hypothesis that a maternal hyperandrogenic environment during pregnancy in women with PCOS may predispose their offspring to fetal hyperandrogenism.

5000|$|A large buy of Firewood {{is usually}} {{purchased}} in English-speaking countries in a quantity called a <b>cord,</b> <b>measuring</b> [...] (a orderly 'tightly packed' stack 4' high x 4' deep x 8' wide). Firewood is {{purchased by the}} cord, or by {{a fraction of a}} cord. Alternatively, it may be bought by the weight instead of by volume. The best fuels are oak wood, ash wood and beech wood, when well seasoned and cut small enough to fit into the grate of the stove.|$|R
40|$|Growth in {{the first}} year of life may already be {{predictive}} of obesity later in childhood. The objective was to assess the association between prenatal exposure to various endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and child growth during the first year. Dichloro-diphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), mono(2 -ethyl- 5 -carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP), mono(2 -ethyl- 5 -hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono(2 -ethyl- 5 -oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), polychlorinated biphenyl- 153, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, and perfluoro-octanoic acid were <b>measured</b> in <b>cord</b> plasma or breast milk. Data on weight, length, and head circumference (HC) until 11 months after birth was obtained from 89 mother-child pairs. Mixed models were composed for each health outcome and exposure in quartiles. For MEOHP, boys in quartile 1 had a higher BMI than higher exposed boys (p = 0. 029). High DDE exposure was associated with low BMI over time in boys (0. 8 kg/...|$|R
40|$|A {{program of}} {{screening}} cord blood {{for evidence of}} primary neonatal hypothyroidism was implemented in a general hospital. In 13 months 3456 newborns were screened: the thyroxine (T 4) and triiodothyronine (T 3) concentrations were <b>measured</b> in <b>cord</b> blood samples, and when the T 4 level was below 8. 0 micrograms/dl thyrotropin was also assayed in the sample. The two-tier program was effective. One hypothyroid newborn was detected and treated. More boys than girls had T 4 levels below 8. 0 micrograms/dl (9. 7 % v. 4. 7 %). The T 4 level correlated with birth weight slightly better in the boys (r = 0. 28 v. 0. 21), and in the boys this correlation was stronger when the birth weight was lower. Regression {{analysis of the data}} for 54 sets of twins indicated that the T 4 level was more strongly related to gestational age than to birth weight...|$|R
40|$|Background: The genetic {{background}} may influence methylmercury (MeHg) metabolism and neurotoxicity. ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters actively transport various xenobiotics across biological membranes. Objective: To investigate {{the role of}} ABC polymorphisms as modifiers of prenatal exposure to MeHg. Methods: The study population consisted of participants (n = 1651) in two birth cohorts, one in Italy and Greece (PHIME) {{and the other in}} Spain (INMA). Women were recruited during pregnancy in Italy and Spain, and during the perinatal period in Greece. Total mercury concentrations were <b>measured</b> in <b>cord</b> blood samples by atomic absorption spectrometry. Maternal fish intake during pregnancy was determined from questionnaires. Polymorphisms (n = 5) in the ABC genes ABCA 1, ABCB 1, ABCC 1 and ABCC 2 were analysed in both cohorts. Results: ABCB 1 rs 2032582, ABCC 1 rs 11075290, and ABCC 2 rs 2273697 modified the associations between maternal fish intak...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} how {{the mode of}} delivery affects the level oxidative stress in newborns. DESIGN AND METHODS: 15 -F(2 t) -isoprostane, as index of oxidative stress, was <b>measured</b> in umbilical <b>cord</b> plasma samples from 37 infants born after vaginal delivery or caesarian section, using specific immuno-affinity extraction and immunoassay. RESULTS: 15 -F(2 t) -isoprostane levels were higher in infants born after vaginal delivery (n= 18) compared to those delivered by elective caesarian section (n= 19). CONCLUSIONS: 15 -F(2 t) -isoprostane is a sensitive biomarker of fetal oxidative stress during labor...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the concentrations of}} protease inhibitors in cord blood after prenatal protease inhibitor use by pregnant women. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of samples collected in a clinical trial. METHODS: Protease inhibitor concentrations were <b>measured</b> in <b>cord</b> blood samples collected from women enrolling in the PACTG 316 study who were receiving prenatal protease inhibitor antiretroviral therapy. RESULTS: In cord blood samples from 68 women treated with protease inhibitors during pregnancy, the concentration of these drugs was below the assay lower limit of detection in most samples, including all samples from women receiving indinavir (n = 21) and saquinavir (n = 8), 5 of 6 samples (83 %) from women receiving ritonavir and 24 of 38 samples (63 %) from women receiving nelfinavir. CONCLUSIONS: Low protease inhibitor concentrations in the fetus decrease the likelihood of teratogenic and toxic effects of these drugs but could fail to provide protection from transplacental or intrapartum transmission of HIV- 1...|$|R
