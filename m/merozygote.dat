50|$|<b>Merozygote</b> is a {{state when}} a cell, usually bacterial, is {{temporarily}} partial diploid as result of DNA transfer processes like conjugation.|$|E
50|$|One {{example of}} how merozygotes can be formed is the {{transfer}} of genetic materialof an Hfr cell to an F- cell through conjugation. When an Hfr cell mates with an F- cell, the chromosome acts as a rolling circle transferring a part of its genomic chromosome across a conjugation bridge. The origin is the first bit of the DNA to be injected, while the F-factor is the last. Very rarely the whole portion of the DNA (from the origin through the F-factor) will be transferred, resulting in a very low chance of passing on the F factor to the F- cell. After conjugation, the F- cell will contain {{a part of the}} Hfr chromosome, the exogenote, as well as its own genomic chromosome, the endogenote. At this stage the cell is called a <b>merozygote.</b> This temporary partial diploid state may lead to recombination between the corresponding portions of the DNA, so that the genetic material of the donor may be incorporated into the chromosome of the recipient, thereby altering the genotype of the recipient. However, if no recombination occurs, the linear fragment of donor DNA in the recipient cytoplasm will be lost after one cycle. These merozygotes help to study dominance variation and mutation can be known.|$|E
40|$|The {{reported}} {{phenomenon that}} the F factor was {{eliminated from the}} cell under conditions of thymine starvation, was studied because this {{seemed to be a}} suitable system to study certain aspects of the control of DNA replication. However, it was found that thymine starvation does not result in the elimination of the F factor from the cell. Thymine starvation of an F prime <b>merozygote</b> stimulates recombination between the episome and the chromosome. Stimulated recombination was studied in a merzygote of constitution lac-z 1 /F' 1 ac-z 2. It was found that under conditions of stimulation, the dominant lac+ recombinants and the recessive lac- homogenotic recombinants were produced with different kinetics. This suggests that recombination in an F prime <b>merozygote</b> is most frequently reciprocal. The kinetics of production of the lac+ segregants gave a reasonable fit to a straight line, which suggests that a recombinational event has a single rate-limiting step. An attempt to determine whether newly-formed lac+ recombinants, in the presence of an inducer, synthesised Beta-galactosidase during starvation or after reversal of inhibition, failed because Beta-galactosidase was found to be repressed during thymine starvation. It was thought possible that recombinationless mutants might possess a structural defect in their DNA, which would prevent repair and therefore recombination. To test this hypothesis, the survival after UV irradiation of lambda-bacteriophage grown on mutant and non-mutant hosts, was determined. No differences in survival were detected, and therefore, no evidence was obtained to support the above hypothesis. One of the strains used in this work was found to be sensitive to acridine orange. The genetic basis of this sensitivity was investigated, but this study was not completed...|$|E
40|$|Mutants {{defective}} {{either in}} the histidine permease (hisP) or in the aromatic permease (aroP) were isolated in Salmonella typhimurium and were characterized. The hisP locus had a 49 % linkage to purF by phage transduction. The aroP locus was close to proA. <b>Merozygotes</b> diploid for the hisP gene were constructed by episomal transfer, and hisP+ was dominant over hisP. The properties of <b>merozygotes</b> are described and discussed. A method for the selection of revertants of hisP mutants was devised. By this method, one of the hisP mutants was characterized as an amber mutant. The specificity of the aromatic permease was investigated by using as substrates analogues of the aromatic amino acids and of histidine...|$|R
40|$|Active-β-galactosidase (EC 3. 2. 1. 23) {{is often}} formed in rec- <b>merozygotes</b> {{containing}} {{a pair of}} mutations in the z gene of the lac operon. Contrary to expectation, with certain pairs of mutants this enzyme, upon dissociation, does not yield two independent polypeptides but only a single continuous protomer. Both genetic recombination and suppression have been ruled out {{as the source of}} this phenomenon. Therefore we believe we are observing the synthesis of one protein from two independently functioning genes...|$|R

Bacteriol. 90 : 8 – 14. 1965. —The genetic determinant controlling {{the sensitivity of}} Escherichia coli K- 12 W 1895 to the basic dyes acriflavine, methylene blue, toluidine blue, crystal violet, methyl green, and pyronine B appears, from results of mating experiments, to be located between the marker governing the utilization of lactose and the origin of genetic transfer. The determinant controlling this {{resistance to}} basic dyes does not control resistance to acid dyes.

40|$|We have {{isolated}} {{a series}} of nondefective φ 80 specialized transducing phage which carry segments of the Salmonella typhimurium trp operon. These phage were obtained from a lysogenic derivative of a <b>merozygote</b> constructed by transferring an S. typhimurium trp episome into an Escherichia coli strain which lacks the normal φ 80 attachment site. The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from one such phage was purified and employed in DNA-ribonucleic acid (RNA) hybridization studies. The results obtained show that, under our hybridization conditions, heterologous hybridization is less efficient than homologous hybridization. It was also observed that not all S. typhimurium trp messenger RNA can readily anneal to E. coli trp operon DNA. Heterologous hybrids consisting of S. typhimurium trp messenger RNA and E. coli trp operon DNA were estimated to have a dissociation constant 10 -fold larger than that of homologous hybrids...|$|E
40|$|In {{standard}} bacterial recombination assays, {{a linear}} fragment of DNA {{is transferred to}} a recipient cell and, at most, a single selected recombinant type is recovered from each <b>merozygote.</b> This contrasts with fungal systems, for which tetrads allow recovery of all meiotic products, including both ultimate recombinant products of an apparent single act of recombination. We have developed a bacterial recombination system in which two recombining sequences are placed in inverse order at widely separated sites in the circular chromosome of Salmonella typhimurium. Recombination can reassort markers between these repeated sequences (double recombination and apparent gene conversion), or can exchange flanking sequences, leading to inversion of the chromosome segment between the recombining sequences. Since two recombinant products remain in the chromosome of a recombinant with an inversion, one can, in principle, approach the capability of tetrad analysis. Using this system, the following observations have been made. (a) When long sequences (40 kb) recombine, conversion frequently accompanies exchange of flanking sequences. (b) When short sequences (5 kb) recombine, conversion rarely accompanies exchange of flanks. (c) Both recA and recB mutations eliminate inversion formation. (d) The frequency of exchanges between short repeats is {{more sensitive to the}} distance separating the recombining sequences in the chromosome. The results are presented with the assumption that inversions occur by simple interaction of two sequences in the same circular chromosome. In an appendix we discuss mechanistically more complex possibilities, some of which could also apply to standard fungal systems...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{recombination}} was {{studied in}} E. coli mutants that carry lesions in the recA gene but retain some capacity for generating recombinant progeny. We observed that recombination was detectable {{only at a}} very low level during the incubation of leaky RecA- <b>merozygotes</b> in broth. However, recombination appeared to occur at much higher frequencies when recombinant progeny were assayed by selection on minimal agar. Analysis of the recombinants obtained with Hfr donors revealed a deficiency of multiple exchanges per unit length of DNA in leaky RecA - strains. In many of these crosses recombinants that inherited donor alleles close to the transfer origin were much reduced in frequency, except when the recipient was also RecB-...|$|R
40|$|Strains {{carrying}} {{either the}} polA 1 or resA 1 mutation are deficient in DNA polymerase I, and the polA 1 and resA 1 mutations do not complement in <b>merozygotes.</b> The {{effect of these}} mutations in otherwise identical genetic backgrounds was studied: after ultraviolet irradiation both strains degrade their DNA more rapidly and more extensively than the wild-type strains. However, after X-ray irradiation the resA 1 strain shows little DNA breakdown and repairs its single-strand breaks. In contrast, the polA 1 strain degrades its DNA extensively, and single-strand breaks are not repaired. Moreover, the resA 1 strain is capable of supporting {{the growth of a}} red− bacteriophage lambda, whereas the polA 1 strain is not...|$|R
40|$|A mutant {{strain of}} Escherichia coli {{that fails to}} recover from {{prolonged}} (72 hr) starvation also fails to grow at 43 C. Extracts of this mutant strain show an increased ribonuclease II activity as compared to extracts of the parental strain, and stable ribonucleic acid is degraded to a larger extent in this strain during starvation. Ts+ transductants and revertants were tested for all the above-mentioned phenotypes. All the Ts+ transductants and revertants tested behaved like the Ts+ parental strain, which suggests that all the observed phenotypes are caused by a single sts (starvation-temperature sensitivity) mutation. The reversion rate from sts− to sts+ is rather low but is {{within the range of}} reversion rates for other single-site mutations. Three-point transduction crosses located this sts mutation between the ilv and rbs genes. The properties of sts+/sts− <b>merozygotes</b> suggested that the Ts− phenotype of this mutation is recessive...|$|R
40|$|The ribosome-releasing factor (RRF) gene was {{localized}} at {{a position}} between 2 and 6 min on the Escherichia coli chromosome {{by measuring the}} gene-dosage-dependent production of RRF in various E. coli F' <b>merozygotes.</b> This position was confirmed and refined by using a nucleotide probe corresponding to a 16 -amino-acid sequence in RRF. It {{was found that the}} RRF gene was contained in pLC 6 - 32 of the Clark-Carbon Gene Bank. Restriction enzyme mapping of E. coli genomic DNA with the above probe led us to conclude that the RRF gene is situated in the 4 -min region, somewhere downstream (clockwise) of the elongation factor Ts gene, tsf. A pLC 6 - 32 -derived DNA fragment which carries the RRF gene was found to contain a partial sequence of tsf. The exact location of the translational initiation site of the RRF gene was determined to be 1. 1 kilobases downstream from the translational termination site of tsf. The RRF gene is designated frr...|$|R
40|$|Ganesan, Ann K. (Syntex Institute of Molecular Biology, Palo Alto, Calif.), and Boris Rotman. Transfer and {{incorporation}} of genes controlling β-d-galactosidase synthesis from Hfr and F′ donors of Escherichia coli. J. Bacteriol. 92 : 1378 – 1382. 1966. —Comparisons were made between Hfr 1 and F 13 donors {{with respect to}} the frequency of transfer and {{incorporation of}} genes controlling β-d-galactosidase synthesis. The Hfr 1 donor transfers these genes as part of the chromosome, and the F 13 donor transfers them by F-duction. The criterion used for gene transfer was the acquisition by recipient cells of the ability to synthesize the enzyme, β-d-galactosidase, measured by fluorogenic assays at the single-cell level. The criterion for incorporation was the formation of lac+ recombinant colonies. It was found that the two types of donor showed the same frequency of gene transfer, but the probability of incorporation was 10 -fold higher in F 13 matings than in Hfr 1 matings. In the former, between 46 and 97 % of the <b>merozygotes</b> produced recombinant colonies; in the latter, 2 to 6 % did so...|$|R
40|$|We have {{isolated}} and characterized {{a number of}} clones resulting from matings of HfrH and HfrC cultures of Escherichia coli with auxotrophic recA- E. coli. As in Low's (1968) experiments, the recA- marker prevented integration of F' episomes into the vegetative chromosomes of the host. Both F'H F'C plasmids contained {{a great variety of}} non-selected nutritional markers. However, more F'H plasmids seemed to have expressed F+ characteristics than did F'C plasmids. These characteristics include (i) the presence of F-pili as determined by susceptibility to male-specific phages; (ii) fertility as determined by the <b>merozygote's</b> ability to transfer nutritional markers to an auxotrophic F- strain of E. coli; and (iii) a high degree of inheritability as estimated by the proportion of F' bacteria to F- bacteria in clones grown in a non-selective medium like broth. This proportion is seen to be affected by both factors that determine the probabilities that daughters of F' bacteria inherit the episome and from physiological factors that determine the rates of growth of F' and F- bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{methods for}} {{chromosomal}} mapping in Escherichia coli are (i) interruption of matings to obtain minimum marker entry times, (ii) linkage analysis of recombinants, and (iii) cotransduction. Method (i) has {{a resolution of}} about 0. 5 min (5 × 104 nucleotides) and is not useful for distances less than about 1 min; methods (ii) and (iii) are capable of better resolution but are generally not very reproducible and no general theory is available for translating crossing-over and cotransduction frequencies into physical chromosomal distances. We found that when <b>merozygotes</b> are irradiated (X rays or ultraviolet light) soon after marker transfer, high linkage values (0. 8 to 1. 0) between nearby marker pairs decrease with radiation dose to 0. 5. Our results are quantitatively {{consistent with the idea}} that radiations induce crossing-over lesions proportional to dose, and the number of such lesions between two markers is proportional to the physical separation of the markers in the range that can also be measured by interruption of mating (0. 5 to 4. 0 min). Additivity relations among markers are also satisfied. We used this technique to measure the distances (0. 1 to 1. 0 min) between several pairs of closely linked markers...|$|R
40|$|The lon− {{mutation}} {{is responsible}} for a defect in cell division of Escherichia coli lightly irradiated with ultraviolet light (UV). These lon− mutants can be isolated readily by a procedure described here. Physiological studies were performed {{with the objective of}} determining the role of the lon gene. Unirradiated lon− mutants grow normally, except that a correlation of this mutation with capsule formation has been noted previously. These two properties can be separated, however. After irradiation, lon− grows as long filaments because septum formation is prevented. The filaments eventually lyse. Mass increase and deoxyribonucleic acid and enzyme synthesis appear to proceed normally. Thus, the lesion produced by UV appears to be highly specific. In bacteria that carry both genes (<b>merozygotes),</b> lon+ is dominant to lon−. Septum formation is restored to irradiated lon− bacteria by introduction of lon+ by conjugation. Also, normal growth can be restored by nutritional variations. It is concluded that lon+ is able to nullify the effects of the UV lesion under conditions where lon− cannot. Possibly, capsule precursors that can accumulate in the latter are responsible for the difference because they interfere with repair of the UV lesion...|$|R
40|$|Johnson, E. M. (Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Washington, D. C.), Stanley Falkow, and L. S. Baron. Recipient {{ability of}} Salmonella typhosa in genetic crosses with Escherichia coli. J. Bacteriol. 87 : 54 – 60. 1964. —Salmonella typhosa strain 643 WSr was mated with Escherichia coli Hfr strains W 1895 and Hayes, with single marker {{selection}} for the E. coli genes lac+ (lactose utilization) and ara+ (arabinose utilization). Four classes of Salmonella hybrids were obtained, each class possessing one marker derived from one E. coli parent. In {{a series of}} eight genetic crosses, in which each hybrid class was remated {{with each of the}} Hfr strains, recipient ability of the hybrids was increased only when their substituted E. coli genetic section matched the lead region of the Hfr chromosome. Data obtained from replica plating indicated that the S. typhosa 643 WSr population is probably homogeneous with respect to its initial ability to mate with E. coli. Transfer of the F-lac element was found to occur only slightly less efficiently from an E. coli F′ donor to S. typhosa than it did to an E. coli F− strain. This indicated that E. coli is able to conjugate almost as effectively with S. typhosa as it does intraspecifically. However, failure to detect β-galactosidase production by <b>merozygotes</b> derived from an E. coli Hfr W 1895 × S. typhosa mating indicated that transfer of chromosomal lac+ may be impaired...|$|R

Bacteriol 90 : 946 – 957. 1965. —The l-arabinose gene complex consists of genes D, A, B, and C, linked {{in that order}} between the markers thr and leu, and an unlinked gene E. Genes D, A, B, and E are the structural genes for three inducible enzymes and permease, respectively. Gene C, with two mutant alleles, C− and Cc, is the regulatory gene exhibiting positive and negative control. C− mutants are deficient and Cc mutants are constitutive for all three enzymes and permease. Complementation analysis, employing sexual <b>merozygotes</b> (A−C+ × A+C−), with six different C− mutants, demonstrates that C− is recessive to C+ (positive control). A total of 61 Cc mutants, isolated as clones resistant to d-fucose inhibition, {{are linked to the}} leu ara region of the chromosome, and the 22 Cc mutants that were analyzed in detail mapped within the C gene among the C− mutant sites. Cc mutants produce various but coordinate levels of the two enzymes measured, and permease. Complementation analysis (A−Cc × A+C−, A−Cc × A+C+) shows that Cc is dominant to C− (positive control) and recessive to C+ (negative control). Deletion mutants that extend into the C gene are l-arabinose permease-negative, thus supporting the positive regulatory role of the C gene. The name “activator gene” is proposed for genes of the C type to accentuate their positive role in gene expression. A working model consistent with these results is presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of 5 -iododeoxyuridine (IUdR) into Escherichia coli K- 12 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) {{has been found}} to decrease significantly the viability of female strains A 288 and JC 411 r but to have only minor effect upon their ability to act as conjugational recipients and to perform recombination after conjugation. In contrast, IUdR incorporation into male strain HfrC appears to interfere with both chromosome transfer and genetic recombination. By using IUdR to densitylabel female DNA, and carrying out large-scale matings with 3 H-thymidine-labeled male cells, we examined the fate of transferred DNA. After a 30 -min mating, the T 6 -sensitive male cells were lysed, and the DNA of the <b>merozygotes</b> and remaining female cells was isolated. Initial centrifugation of this DNA in a CsCl gradient showed that the male and female DNA species were associated. The nature of this association of the parental DNA species was determined by formaldehyde denaturation followed by CsCl centrifugation. Denaturation of DNA isolated immediately after T 6 lysis gave a peak of radioactivity banding at the density of light single-stranded DNA. However, denaturation of DNA isolated after T 6 lysis and dilution of the cells into fresh medium, exhibited peaks of radioactivity banding at positions corresponding to single-stranded, density-labeled DNA. The results indicate that recombination after conjugation in E. coli takes place by a breakage-and-reunion mechanism. The process of recombination can be separated into two stages. In the first stage, the donor and recipient DNA molecules become associated. The second stage consists of the formation of phosphodiester bonds between the donor and recipient segments comprising the recombinant molecule...|$|R
