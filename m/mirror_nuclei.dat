40|$|Asymptotic {{normalization}} coefficients (ANCs) {{are fundamental}} nuclear constants playing {{important role in}} nuclear reactions, nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics. In this paper the physical reasons of the Coulomb renormalization of the ANC are addressed. Using Pinkston-Satchler equation the ratio for the proton and neutron ANCs of <b>mirror</b> <b>nuclei</b> is obtained {{in terms of the}} Wronskians from the radial overlap functions and regular solutions of the two-body Schrödinger equation with the short-range interaction excluded. This ratio allows one to use microscopic overlap functions for <b>mirror</b> <b>nuclei</b> in the internal region, where they are the most accurate, to correctly predict the ratio of the ANCs for <b>mirror</b> <b>nuclei,</b> which determine the amplitudes of the tails of the overlap functions. Calculations presented for different nuclei demonstrate the Coulomb renormalization effects and independence of the ratio of the nucleon ANCs for <b>mirror</b> <b>nuclei</b> on the channel radius. This ratio is valid both for bound states and resonances. One of the goals {{of this paper is to}} draw attention on the possibility to use the Coulomb renormalized ANCs rather than the standard ones especially when the standard ANCs are too large.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} suggested {{that differences in}} the charge radii of <b>mirror</b> <b>nuclei</b> are proportional to the neutron-skin thickness of neutron-rich nuclei and to {{the slope of the}} symmetry energy $L$ [B. A. Brown Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 122502 (2017) ]. The determination of the neutron skin has important implications for nuclear physics and astrophysics. Although the use of electroweak probes provides a largely model-independent determination of the neutron skin, the experimental challenges are enormous. Thus, the possibility that differences in the charge radii of <b>mirror</b> <b>nuclei</b> may be used as a surrogate for the neutron skin is a welcome alternative. To test the validity of this assumption we perform calculations based on a set of relativistic energy density functionals that span a wide region of values of $L$. Our results confirm that the difference in charge radii of various neutron-deficient nickel isotopes and their corresponding <b>mirror</b> <b>nuclei</b> is indeed strongly correlated to both the neutron-skin thickness and $L$. Moreover, given that various neutron-star properties are also sensitive to $L$, a data-to-data relation emerges between the difference in charge radii of <b>mirror</b> <b>nuclei</b> and the radius of low-mass neutron stars.
